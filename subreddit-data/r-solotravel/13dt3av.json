    "postText": "So recently I (22M) have had this itch to get out and see the world and want to plan a 14-20 day trip through Portugal and Spain. I\u2019m more interested in just being in the cities and living like a local as opposed to doing the touristy stuff like museums. I think spending more time in each city would be a good way to really absorb everything and get a feel for the city so I\u2019m thinking 4-5 days in each city. Doing this I have to decide between a couple cities to stay in. \n\nDay 1-5: Fly into Lisbon \nDay 6-9: Porto (possible day trip to Aveiro)\nDay 10-14: Either Madrid or Barcelona, still deciding so if anyone can give experiences in these cities\nDay 15-20: Seville\n\nMy budget is around $3k total not counting air fare. Is there a better order to visit these cities in? Im not familiar with the train or bus systems there. Any insight into these cities would be great.",

You will probably run out of touristic things to do, but just a pleasant walk and some tapas in Granada sounds lovely (tapas are from Andaluc\u00eda, although they are served throughout Spain). I think is more authentic in the sense that Madrid sometimes feel like another big European city for me, but when you are in Granada you know you are in Granada.\n\nToledo and C\u00f3rdoba are both great options. Personally I'd take C\u00f3rdoba. Historically is extremely important (Especially for the roman empire and califato ages). The Mosque-Cathedral is just unique. But hey, I'm pretty biased here, I think you will enjoy both options :D",

I\u2019m not really looking for another big European city as I\u2019ve been to quite a few already. I love to just linger around, explore non-touristy areas/stores and do some people watching. Maybe more authentic Granada is my kinda city then!\n\nRegarding Toledo and Cordoba, mhh it\u2019s a tricky one.. But I follow your reasoning on the importance of Cordoba. They both look beautiful, maybe I should try to squeeze in both of them.\n\nDo you have any recomendations for day hikes from Madrid and Granada?",

It's around 8h in total, 22km although there are shorter versions. Avoid doing it on winter.\n\nYou also have \"Ruta de los Cahorros de Monachil\", an easier and shorter option but still pretty beautiful.\n\nI bet there are more cool options nearby Madrid, although it's hard to beat the first one :P",

More to do and see. \n\nNumber one thing I would recommend is booking any tourist stuff you actually want do want to see in advance. Tickets sell out or become places crowded and you don\u2019t want to get there see something cool and find out you can\u2019t go see it.\n\nOver all I think 4-5 days in each place is good amount of time. I would say Porto you could probably do with 3 days though. Definitely recommend a day trip to sintra while in Lisbon as well.\n\nOrder of cities really depends on train/plane schedules.(like if you\u2019re flying home from Barca or the flights cheaper, you\u2019d go to Seville first and make Barca your last stop)",

If you like it frugal, the current Flixbus specials are also worth checking out, you can go from city to city for 1-5 Euros.\n\nI recommend not wasting money on renting a car. Think 7-8 Euro per gallon for gas, plus tolls on all bigger highways. The cities you're planning to visit are best explored walking. Aveiro also has an excellent bike path network around its lagoon and \"house beaches\", which are worth exploring. Enjoy!\n\nEDIT, PS added: There are also a few voices on this thread that advise you to spend only one day or not time at all in Aveiro. Based on their posts, it seems some have never been there, others just skipped through, while at least one person only saw its Rossio park area (which is under construction). All of them didn't even scratch the surface.\n\nMuch of that is rooted in 40 years old tourism brochures that mislabeled it as the \"Venice of Portugal\" (it's not) and that are still regurgitated on travel \"influencer\" blogs. Those are the same blogs that still label surfing hotspot Nazar\u00e9 (90 minutes to the south) a \"sleepy fishing village\" (it's not, anymore). That's just old marketing copy lifted elsewehere.\n\nI think Lonely Planet can be trusted as a source in such matters. They just recommended S\u00e3o Jacinto Beach (Praia de S\u00e3o Jacinto), Aveiro's house beach, as one of the best beaches in Portugal (# 6).

I was there at Christmas so it was extra magical but I just fell in love with the city at night.\n\n\u2022 Check out the Egyptian temple in Parque del Oeste. I actually walked the entire length of the park from the Temple of Debod to the Spanish Civil War bunkers on the far end, then from there up to the Arco de la Victoria. I was alone and it was at night so probably not my smartest move ever but I don't regret it; the park is beautiful. \n\n\u2022 We went to Kapital on a Sunday night and it wasn't very busy, most of the upper floors were closed. I actually preferred the more laid back vibe and having room to move around but if you're into clubbing and want the full 7-story packed experience go on a Friday or Saturday night past midnight. \n\n\u2022 If you do go to clubs be aware that your cover typically includes two drink tickets which is nice. \n\n\u2022 If you drink, walk into literally any local bar that looks interesting and get tapas and a local beer. No research, no trying to find \"the best.\" I went to a few bars in Madrid since beers are so insanely cheap there but my best memories were at the bar directly across the street from my room. I could see my bed from the barstool. Some of the best beer I've ever had and the friendliest bartenders I've met. I ended up with a free t-shirt. It was great. \n\n\u2022 Use a student ID if you have one, most museums and cultural sites give you free admission or a great discount\n\n\u2022 Check out the Palacio Real; I hate monarchy as a concept but the opportunity to tour an active royal palace for so cheap is pretty unique (Buckingham Palace charges \u20ac35 for a regular adult ticket, Palacio Real is \u20ac12 and was only \u20ac6 for me as a student).\n\nSorry for the essay length column I've just written but I loved Madrid so much and it's still probably my favorite city I've visited in the world. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!\n\nEdit: Oh also you may already know this but they stay up LATE in Madrid. Typical dinner time is past 9pm at the earliest. This worked out for me as I didn't have any jetlag, I'd just wake up at 3pm and stay up until 6am every night and I got along just fine.",

The Prado is a classic great museum and getting there early is a must but skipping it would be a crime. It is incredible. A guided tour sounds cheesy but helps to get oriented - it is big. I would go back tomorrow just for the Prado and Thyssen. \n\nI don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t want to embrace being a young tourist discovering new places. Locals have to work and do daily things. Tourists get to escape reality for a while and live lives of perpetual discovery. Savor that! \n\nToledo 1 day, Seville 2 days. Madrid over Barcelona. Great Japanese food in Portugal. Leave room for surprises and time for wandering.",

You don\u2019t have to fly, but just to get a feel for what packing and prep is like for a short trip to help you better prepare for the longer one. If that\u2019s not an option, do a trial run on packing and prep at your house and pretend you\u2019re on the trip and living out of your suitcase. This may help you prep!\n\nThat being said, I\u2019ve never done Portugal but Barcelona is a MUST for Spain. Park Guell, La Sagrada Familia, the Mediterranean coast\u2026 it\u2019s a gorgeous city and I cannot recommend making time for it enough. I think your budget is reasonable. Most of your budget tends to go to airfare. \n\nI hope you have the most amazing time! Spain was the first country I visited outside of the US and my first time flying too. It\u2019s such a beautiful place and a fantastic choice for a first time abroad experience!",

It looks good on a map, but it's a 8-9 hour train/bus journey, so you'll want to avoid that particular route.\n\nWith 20 days, you've got enough time to really see the highlights of Portugal and Spain. The ideal route would start in Porto and end in Barcelona (or vice versa), but if you really have to fly into Lisbon I'd probably cut Porto and put the extra time into other places along the way.\n\nA couple optimized itineraries to consider:\n\n - [Porto to Barcelona in 20 days](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=porto$2$r~coimbra$2~lisbon$3~lagos$3~sevilla$2~granada$2~cordoba$0$e~madrid$3~barcelona$3$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=20&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;) with the Algarve, Sevilla, Granada and Madrid. Coimbra is another very cool town to include between Porto and Lisbon, but would be the first cut if you have less time. Going south to the Algarve not only lets you see one of Europe's most gorgeous stretches of coastline, but it makes it much easier to get over to Spain (Sevilla is a ~4.5 hr bus ride). \n\n - [Lisbon to Barcelona in 20 days](https://tripsnek.com/planned?itinerary=lisbon$3$r~salema$3~sevilla$2~granada$3~cordoba$0$e~madrid$3~toledo$2~barcelona$4$r&amp;trans=Train&amp;nights=20&amp;pace=Moderate&amp;) with Toledo and more time in Barcelona substituted for Porto.

It'll help you practice learning a new transit system, juggling all your documents and things, realizing how heavy your bag actually is, etc. \n\nGood luck, and have an incredible trip!",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve just spent five weeks travelling around south eastern Spain and Seville is beautiful! One of the most aesthetically pleasing cities in that area I thought. \nMaybe not enough to do for 5 days there though. I would suggest as some others have said, maybe going to Barcelona and Madrid (I caught the train between the two, it was a couple of hours and very comfortable). Barcelona has a lot to do and see but I really liked Madrid too, it felt a bit less like it was catered for tourists like Barca is. Less tourists traps and scammers I felt which was nice. \n\nMy main tip would be to learn some Spanish, have google translate on your phone and be ready for drastically different service levels to what you are used to. I am from Australia but have travelled in the US and know the service in stores and restaurants in our countries are quite similar! In Seville in particular knowing some Spanish was necessary, you need to ask for service when you want it in restaurants, you ask for the bill and to pay when you are ready, they will not come to you nor check in while you are eating or even seem like they really want to help you sometimes haha!! It was a fun experience I thought but can be a bit of a shock if you are not prepared or used to it! \n\nIn Madrid and Barcelona you could get by with English if sticking to more touristy places if you really didn\u2019t want to learn Spanish. But then they were then a lot more expensive than if going to a more local place and the food isn\u2019t as good (generally). You can normally tell what places will be more tourist catered by them having the menu in English and Spanish. \n\nHave fun!",

If you go to the Iberian Peninsula claiming to be Portuguese but can\u2019t speak it never been there people are going to laugh at you and be very confused.  just sayin   But you\u2019ll have a fantastic trip, go for it!  :)",

I understand and agree, but in our defense, a lot of us have pride in where our families came from because we have no real culture in the US. A lot of people here don\u2019t even KNOW where their families came from. Those of us who know and care, are proud of it. We can\u2019t help that we were born in the US. I am still half Colombian by ethnicity even though I was not born there. My grandma was from there and moved here to the US. I feel like I missed out on growing up there and being more exposed to the culture and life there. We don\u2019t try to claim these places as our nationality but rather our ethnicity and heritage because we are still proud to have ancestry from these places.",

It\u2019s ridiculous.

Saying \u2018I AM\u2019 Portuguese or Colombian in these cases is incorrect - that IS trying to claim nationality.  Youse have Portuguese &amp; Colombian *heritage*.    My great grandfather was Portuguese-Jamaican - I sure don\u2019t claim to be Portuguese or Jamaican, or even Scottish which *all my other* ancestors were - and I\u2019m damn proud of all my ancestors more for what they did, less for simply their nationality.

You will be working in the cities? \n\nAlso if you never left California before I would recommend seeing a museum or two (especially Madrid has one of the best ones in Europe) just to get a taste what is out there. Other than that all cities have a great public transport system but it gets HOT after April (although you\u2019ll be used to it working AC is not standard everywhere you go in Europe) And be aware a lot closes around noon and opens again around 4/5pm til late.

You'll eat up your budget quickly there. Museums can be expensive as well. \n\nTo stretch your budget, book trains and inter-Euro flights well in advance. A few months at least. Intercity buses in Spain are especially cheap as well especially in advance. \n\nI would not skip Madrid. The Prado and Reina Sofia have some of the world's most priceless works of art. each offers free tickets every day near the end of the day. Scope out their websites to make sure those programs are still active, and arrive early to beat the lines. \n\nBuy gummies at the convenience stores :))) I don't know why but Spain is gummy-obsessed and I love it so much. \n\nLavapi\u00e9s is super cool Madrid neighborhood:)\n\nYou can \"ball out\" more at Portugal restaurants bc overall cost of living is cheaper (though the infkux of digital nomads may be changing this). Always try to eat outside main tourist centers for the better price. In Spain, small cafes will serve things like Spanish omelette (tortilla espa\u00f1ola) which is delicious and inexpensive and very authentic. Definitely plan to eat paella in Barcelona if you go. \n\nI would offer Bilbao/San Sebastian for some of the most delicious and authentic food experiences in all of Spain. Plus, they're water adjacent and extremely cool places. \n\nHave a wonderful trip!",

It later thrived under Visigothic rule, then it was conquered by Arabs, then it was re-conquered by the Franks. Eventually it came under Spanish rule. \n\nDespite it's beleaguered past, Barcelona has remained fiercely independent. It has its own language and culture: Catalan. Barcelona was once a significant Mediterranean maritime power, and it shows. Not just the perennially cool breeze from the sea. The city is incredibly diverse. \n\nMadrid and Seville are also amazing cities. If I had to prioritize, I would say 1. Barcelona. 2. Madrid. 3. Seville.",

I also think Madrid is an underrated city and is definitely worth visiting. From there you can do a day trip to Toledo which is a cool experience, especially if you like history. Barcelona is an awesome city and highly recommend as there is so much to see and do there and it isn\u2019t crazy expensive either. Like others noted you should add Seville as well. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind, you\u2019ll need to fly from Lisbon to Madrid (it\u2019s what I did) or you\u2019ll have to take a long bus ride.

I will say that Barcelona is amazing, so walkable and use public transport rather than taxis and Ubers! Lots to do and eat, and 4-5 days is a perfect amount of time, any longer and it is a bit too much. \n\nPublic transport is sooo easy to navigate, if you have Google maps! Everything has English, and once you observe others and follow their lead, everything will make sense. I recommend getting the t-casual pass, which gives you 10 trips. It's more than enough, since you'll find yourself walking most places. \n\nFeel free to reach out with any questions!

Barcelona is  great but extremely, extremely touristy and unless you take a flight it will take a very long time to get from Barcelona to Seville.

The coastline in the city is not that beautiful, but the city itself is beautiful.\n\nALSA is the main bus provider in Spain and the cheapest way to get around. RENFE is the train company.  Unless you want to do Faro instead of Porto or Libson, it would probably be advisable to take a flight from Portugal to your first city in Spain. If you want to minimize the time you spend in transit: I would do Libson/Porto--&gt; Faro&gt; Seville&gt; Madrid.\n\nSeville is my favorite city in Spain. Im so glad you are including it as a stop. I recommend the Black Swan Hostel if you are on a budget.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited to add : Also ending in madrid or bcn over seville  will allow you to take a direct flight back to the state or at least have more options.",

Not sure but I think 1-2 days would suffice. I\u2019ve been to Lisbon, 2-3 days would be fine. Are you into electronic music or soccer/football? I would plan my trip around that. Also, start wherever you can get the cheapest flights to. And just go in a circular direction. Makes it easier",

            "comment": "&gt; I\u2019m more interested in just being in the cities and living like a local as opposed to doing the touristy stuff like museums. \n\nHere's some advice from someone who has been traveling and living abroad for many years: don't go full hog on the notion that you can \"live like a local\". There's nothing wrong with \"touristy\" stuff because...you're a tourist!\n\nFirst, Spain in particular has some amazing museums. If you don't take an opportunity to visit, say, the Prado, I would go so far as to say that you've wasted part of your trip.\n\nSecond, in 14-20 days, you can certainly get a glimpse of local life, but it's nowhere near enough time to integrate yourself into even one city.\n\nSpain and Portugal are two of the most overtouristed places in the world right now. Unless you're going to head directly for the boonies, you're not going to land and step into an unperturbed world of authentic Spanish and Portuguese life free from the influences of tourism. Sorry, but that's just reality.",

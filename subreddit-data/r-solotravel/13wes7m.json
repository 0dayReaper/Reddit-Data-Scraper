    "postText": "I just finished a solo trip to Nepal and I can't help shake these anxieties. Though the Nepali people were some of the kindest and warmest people I've ever met, every local I talked to told me how difficult life is because of their corrupt government. How basic necessities such as education and health care were so difficult to attain due to the income inequalities among their population.\n\nI realize this and also think: And here I am, using money for such a seemingly selfish personal gain  of travel. Part of me feels like perhaps I can donate money, or join a cause of some sort - but these feel like bandage measures which are ultimately short-lived and would never solve root problems.\n\nOn one hand, I feel so thankful for the privilege of being able to travel. On the other, I feel entirely broken because my life could have been so much more difficult, and I now realize this through an altered perspective. It's one thing to read about corruption in text; it's entirely another to see it and view it first-hand before your own eyes - and feel completely helpless about it.\n\nTo add insult, it seems like no one amongst my immediate friend groups and acquaintances seem to care. Perhaps I just want someone to hear, but has anyone else delt with such feelings after traveling abroad?",

If this trip was eye-opening for you  or has challenged your perspective, that\u2019s great; but resist the temptation to think \u201cseeing other people living a different life than what I\u2019m used to has made me feel sorry for them.\u201d I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re from, but chances are good that if you look around your own country you\u2019ll find plenty of kind, warm people with difficult lives because of all kinds of oppression. You just found them in Nepal because when we travel, we tend to be more open and curious. \n\nYour heart is in the right place, but here are the facts: 1. you are allowed to travel and enjoy your own life even if others can\u2019t or don\u2019t. 2. You will not single-handedly solve these problems, but that doesn\u2019t mean your contributions don\u2019t matter.\n\nTry to see what small changes you can make in your life at home that will help others. Start there and keep your mind open.",

You're not likely to change anything but it's awful to think people would be in this situation and the world would be oblivious.\n\nIt's also normal to feel guilt like that.

I do my best to avoid franchise/chain restaurants and shops.\n\nTo add to this, I would add to avoid haggling on price if the price is a reasonable deal. \nI see far too many articles and videos of people trying to get something cheap from someone in a poor country.\n\nIf OP wants to donate their time they could always look in to teaching volunteer work for a poor country. I have mixed feelings on the \"volunteer tourism\" where people come for a week to help, take pictures, and then leave. Sometimes it seems selfish for virtue signaling. Overall I think it is positive since it helps a little while making the traveler aware of the issues poor people are facing and occasionally some of these tourists follow through on future donations and longer term volunteer work.",

Then I moved to Australia as a preteen and I was beyond shocked at how my peers had no idea how lucky they were for the things and the upbringing they had, and how they had no issues wasting food, or paper or pencils etc. Eventually I grew used to it but I still try to hold onto that perspective I had gained as a kid.

Guilt about treating a place with so much poverty as a place to just take a trip for a few weeks and then go home.\n\nI do think you can argue that seeing such things firsthand can motivate caring about global wealth and health disparities in ways that just reading about it might not. It's not just Nepal, it's the entire planet, when a tiny number of CEOs have enormous amounts of wealth and power, but nearly half the world's population doesn't have access to basic sanitation. \n\nI think rather than beating yourself up at the individual level though, perhaps use this as motivation to learn more about what the problems are at the structural level worldwide (one of the main problems worldwide being a certain economic system designed to romanticize pursuit of profit above all else), as well as to seek out like-minded people who are looking to make things better (getting involved in activism overseas directly can be legally risky, perhaps better to make donations from afar when you get home, and also seek out local movements to become involved in - support your local unions for instance, or fight your local NIMBYs for affordable housing). \n\nAlexandria Ocasio Cortez the US leftist politician talked about using fear and anger as \"fuel\" to drive becoming an activist in whatever ways you can, and it's something I think about a lot in these politically scary times. Yes there's a lot of ugliness in the world but I think covid has helped a lot of people see that ugliness more clearly - I've never seen so much discussion online about wealth disparities, people feeling like they're being exploited for their labor and time by corporations, etc., so I'm hopeful that we may be moving towards some much-needed reforms centering human needs over corporate profits.",

Meaning to give some thought to exactly how your role as a tourist in the country impacts it and who it is impacting. Money into local economies can be a huge help but sending it to the local Marriott or Hilton isn't as much nor is supporting that sketchy donkey ride place clearly mistreating their animals etc. \n\nAlso for me, despite being interested really to go almost anywhere - there are some hard lines for me on truly corrupt and authoritarian governments - and that includes mostly where my visit will primarily financially go to the government or will implicitly be endorsing (though I'm no real influencer) an authoritarian government or its policies. So for example, with North Korea, I do think it'd be really interesting to visit - but there's no way to do that without hitting all three of those red flags.

I will always tip workers in hotel and restaurants. When I'm leaving the place I try to donate unused groceries or such to a local charity.

I totally get your feelings.  It is hard to believe how little money and resources the people in other countries have - getting by on $5 a day, living in tiny huts, etc.  \n\nAlso, this country (USA) is one of the biggest messes out there in terms of our politics/divisions and how we allow the rich to do what they want to the detriment of the rest of us.  They get out of paying their fair share and make their money off the backs of people barely able to feed their families; then they take away social safety nets and try to go after the money we have paid into programs for decades.  We are also harming other countries by being a taker of too much of the world's share of raw materials, etc.  I feel bad about that and try to do small things to make a change - ripple effect.  \n\nDon't be too hard on your friends because if we spend a lot of time feeling bad, we are too depressed to do anything about it.  It is hard to just focus on pain because it hurts too much.  I don't know that they are being insensitive or just using a coping mechanism to get through it.",

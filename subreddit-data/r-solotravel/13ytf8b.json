    "postText": "For one week this July, flying out of Paris, flying into Dublin.\n\nMy budget is \u20ac1000 including flights and accommodation, so would prefer to have a place that has hostels.\n\nI first looked into Corsica, because I was interested in its history and has cheap flights from Paris, but gosh that island is really expensive, accommodation on average is about \u20ac200 a night with no hostels.\n\nAnd nearby Sardinia is only a tad cheaper but also has no hostels.\n\nI\u2019ve already been to: Mallorca, Malaga, Santorini, Mykonos, Rhodes, Algarve, Malta, Naples, a few small Greek islands near Athens, and the Dalmatian Coast of Croatia. Would be open to new destinations.\n\nGoals: just would like some beautiful warm beach to relax on for a week, some good Mediterranean food, and preferably direct flights. Not too interested in partying.\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for your thoughtful responses! Didn\u2019t know about Albania\u2019s beaches but am looking into it now \ud83d\ude4f",

Or you could fly to Santorini / Athens and head to a quieter island like Sifnos/Serifos/Paros etc. \n\nOutside of the EU, I can think of the Turkish Riviera which is definitely a LOOOOOT cheaper than anywhere in Europe and has some stunning side attractions like Greek/Roman ruins (look up the area around Izmir and Bodrum, lots of small villages there with lovely places to stay). Alternatively, you could get to Morocco's Agadir or Essaouira areas which aren't technically Mediterranean but have nice beaches, warm weather, and excellent value accommodation.",

Beautiful beaches, cheap, decent food and will be relatively quiet compared to most of the Mediterranean in July as Albania is not yet as popular as its neighbours. Not sure whether there are more local airports but the best beaches are at least a half day bus ride from Tirana, so if you've only got a week it's worth checking travel times.",

They are more suited to exploration and less to beach days though. But Corsica is also not really a beach destination, and contrary to the Mediterranean these locations are still less tourist inflated for the moment (safe for Tenerife, which has been a popular destination for the past 30 years).\n\nThere are some smaller islands in Greece that could fit the bill in the Aegean sea, such as those in the North, the Dodecanese islands, or further south in the Cyclades archipelago (skipping the popular tourist inflated ones such as Santorini or Mykonos). The Ionian side is also an option, but slightly less \"raw\". There are over 6000 islands in Greece, you're bound to find one to your liking. I also notice you haven't been to Crete or Cyprus. Not the cheapest or chillest locations, but easy to reach.\n\nOn the Dalmatian coast Hvar is worth a trip, but it is more of a party island and the beaches are unfortunately all rocky.\n\nOther than that I'm afraid there are few to no options that fit your requirements.",

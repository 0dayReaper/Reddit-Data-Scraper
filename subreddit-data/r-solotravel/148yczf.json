    "postText": "Here late August or maybe Early September starting from Idaho I want to do a 3 month long or so road trip across the United States living out of the back of my Ford Ranger Blue Highways or Travels With Charlie style.\n\nIdeally I want to do this old school without a gps and taking as many forest roads and back ways as I can. I want to learn the ability to navigate the old style but so far all I've really done is pen down a basic route in a notebook, while looking over my new atlas. I just don't have a lot of confidence in it nor any idea how long it'll take.\n\nAnyone have any wisdom about the old skills they're willing to tell?",

We used to get them in the front of the phone book. Not sure where you will buy them now? It was a pain in the arse. I don\u2019t miss using that skill.",

You could do it completely the old fashioned way but this would be the least headache balance between the two since it can take into account highway speeds and such.",

You'll need to swing onto interstates to go into those, but they would have basically all the info you'd ever need.",

Unless you want an additional theme like always stay at X kind of campground, all you have to do is to make sure you have enough gas to make it to the next station. The route will take care of itself.",

The map has a key that lets you know what kind of road they are, just look for the smaller ones.  The big thing to be cautious about are the seasonal roads, some might be impassable even at the best of times.  They also make maps specifically for outdoor recreation that are more specific about forests, hiking trails etc.  Maps like that are much more area specific,",

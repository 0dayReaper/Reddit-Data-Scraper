    "postText": "Hello folks :) I\u2019ve just begun planning a 13 nights solo trip in the second half of Sep\u201923. It\u2019s a round trip to Munich and this is unchangeable. The logistics won\u2019t allow me to do a multi city as much as I know that makes more sense. I won\u2019t be driving anywhere. Please let me know if the days are spread out well or if I\u2019ve packed too much. Thanks!! \n\nHere\u2019s the itinerary I have planned for now:\n\nVienna\n- Tue: Land in Munich (approx 6-7am), take a bus to Vienna. Spend an easy 1/2 day in Vienna (maybe do a walking tour if I can secure one for past 3pm)\n- Wed/Thu: 2 full days in Vienna (definitely visiting the palace and watching an opera show at night)\n\nBudapest \n- Fri: 3h Flixbus to Budapest, 1/2 day there \n- Sat: full day in Budapest \n- Sun: full day until 10pm \n\nPrague\n- Sun: 11pm overnight train/bus to Prague (please give me your thoughts on whether to take a bus or a sleeper train; train schedules don\u2019t seem to be out yet as far as I can tell) \n- Mon/ Tue/ Wed: Mon arrive in Prague at 6am, all are full days\n\nMunich (I\u2019ve visited Munich before so I\u2019ve done most of the typical itinerary) \n- Thu: Regiojet bus to Munich, 1/2 day (Oktoberfest? Is this enjoyable solo?) \n- Fri/ Sat: full days at Dachau concentration camp, F\u00fc\u00dfen area/ Neuschwanstein (do share your thoughts on the castle, I\u2019ve read a lot of people saying it\u2019s a touristy trap) \n- Sat: 1/2 day before flying off at night",

            "comment": "I think if you're near Oktoberfest anyway and aren't freaked out by crowds, you should go just to experience it, it's a unique vibe. Most tables are reserved and/or occupied by groups, so being solo is an advantage in the sense that you can ask if you can sit down in a spare space, whereas a group of three might not be able to find a spare space.\n\nThe problem with Neuschwanstein is that it's sort of in the middle of nowhere, so hard and/or time consuming to get to AND you've sort of already seen it 100 times AND it doesn't have much history. I've also heard that the interior tour is underwhelming but haven't done it myself. I guess my point is that if you aren't dying to do it, it's sorta skippable in my opinion.",

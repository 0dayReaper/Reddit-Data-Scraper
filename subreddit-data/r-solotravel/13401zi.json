    "postText": "I\u2019m planning to go to Nice, France as my first solo trip in September or early October after graduation before starting my job but I\u2019ve seen some really mixed reviews about safety as a young woman alone. I\u2019ve seen people saying about pickpocketing which is to be expected in most cities and tourist spots, but I was told by a friend who\u2019s been along the south coast a few times it\u2019s not safe for a young woman to go to the beach alone. Part of my choice was to go somewhere warm so I could enjoy the beach! I saw a post on a different sub that also scared me a little saying about the gang tactics with theft, which I hadn\u2019t heard about before. \n\nAre they over exaggerating (or just had an unlucky time themselves) or should I pick somewhere else to visit? \n\nI do also speak a little French (absolute basics but I hope to practice before I go) if that helps much. \n\nOn another note, I\u2019ve had a bit of a scroll through here but if anyone has any tips in general about solo travel I\u2019d love to hear it :)\n\nSorry for the long post, just a bit confused and as it\u2019ll be my first time there and my first time travelling alone I don\u2019t want to mess up! Thanks for any advice/experiences\n\nEdit for clarity: by warm, I\u2019m aware it\u2019s not hot but it\u2019s warmer than where I live",

            "comment": "I went to Nice solo as a 42 F last summer and loved it. I personally tend to be cautious, so the only time I went to a beach I chose a private one (Beau Rivage). I think it was worth the splurge to feel better about not having my phone and wallet swiped. \n\nI honestly never felt unsafe- the only downside i found is that there are a lot of smokers and air pollution from boats and motorbikes. \n\nThe metro and trains are very easy to use, but the city is very walkable (though I did melt in the heat!) \n\nI loved Viator for side trips (including one to Eze and Monaco), though I mostly toured museums on my own. I highly recommend taking the SNCF train to medieval towns in the Alps- most of them are less touristy/crowded than Eze, and have fortresses/castles you can hike to. \n\nFor food, I highly recommend the socca (chickpea pancake cooked in olive oil), and seafood in general.",

            "comment": "Early October France / Nice isn\u2019t that particularly warm, the private beaches would very well be closed down for the season already?  At least around near the Spanish border the beachy stuff all close thru Sept - Nice in particular idk, all the times I\u2019ve been there were early summer .   It would probably be warm enough to like sit on the beach but idk about the water &amp; actual swimming.   Southern Spain would still be warmer than France &amp; have beachy-touristy stuff open. \n\n Wherever beaches, yeah going alone has risk of belongings going missing so just don\u2019t take expensive items with you, take only like a towel &amp; book so it\u2019s obvious you have nothing to rob, and try sit yourself near to families and when you arrive on the beach make some smiles &amp; cordial gestures to the people around you (if there are any lol).  I doubt there\u2019s risk of like attacks or anything like that.  Harrassment from beggars &amp; junkies *may*be but even than that\u2019s more likely around city tourist sights.  France / Spain etc are safe for solo female travellers apart from late-night dodgy areas (or highway/freeway trucking pit-stops where prostitutes frequent lol), so don\u2019t be worried about that.  \n\nOn the other hand, if the beach action isn\u2019t particularly happening for you, from Nice it\u2019s a lovely 4 and half-hour train ride (trains go every hour) to Avignon which is a gorgeous medieval fortress town &amp; arts centralle, in the heart of Provence.  You could go do 2 or 3 nights in Avignon &amp; back to Nice.  Or into Italy which is right there - even if you just go to Ventimiglia just across the border - it\u2019s a sweet little town - or a bit further along to San Remo. \n\nHow exciting, have a great trip!  :)",

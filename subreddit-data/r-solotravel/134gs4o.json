    "postText": "So I booked a super spontaneous trip to Vietnam in mid-September, landing in Bangkok and flying to Hanoi to begin my 12-14 day trip. I have never been to Vietnam and with it being wet season, have read so much conflicting info. I'd love some feedback about my **mega-super-rough** itinerary. I'm aware that I don't stay in one-spot for more than 2 nights but that's kinda the way I travel as I tend to get bored very quick haha. But please do let me know if it's way too chaotic :)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\- 16-18th - Land in Bangkok and chill for a couple before I fly to Hanoi to start the trip.\n\n\\- 18-20th - Hanoi\n\n\\- 20-22th -  Sa Pa (Should I stop at Mu Cang Chai for a night on the way since it\u2019s 7h to sa pa on the bus?).\n\n\\- 22 - 23th - Head back to Hanoi and spend another night here as I will be wrecked from the 6-7h bus back.\n\n\\- 23 - 25th - Ninh Binh.\n\n\\- 25 - 27th - Da Nang/more likely to be Hoi An. \n\n\\- 27- 29- HMC.\n\n\\- 29th - Fly home.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI start work on October 1st, so I can also add September 30th and October 1st. Should I extend a location by 1-2 days or should I go somewhere else as well?\n\nThanks all!",

Apparently there's also an airport near Sapa now too , you might want to check that out.

Also there is normally a morning market in near the riverfront that is great for photography.\nRegarding the ticket, normally, as is in some china old tows, you can skip it if you don't go through certain places.\nNormally they check the ticket near the wooden bridge in hoi an.

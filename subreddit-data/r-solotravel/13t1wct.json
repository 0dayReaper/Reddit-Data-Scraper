    "postText": "Oh my god I don\u2019t want to generalize people by groups, but I just met the worst old people staying in the hostel. Typing this in the middle of the night.\n\nFirst, I smelt smokes in the kitchen in the room and saw an unattended pot on stove with burned chicken, and I immediately turned off the stove. Told front desk about it and an old guy hanging in the common room said it\u2019s his. I then confronted him how dangerous that was for any wooden structure, and he just shrugged and went back to the kitchen.\n\nAnd then in the middle of the night, this old guy started playing audio book recordings, and maybe forgot turning it off for the whole night after he went to sleep???? It\u2019s not too loud but I as a light sleeper couldn\u2019t do it. Just texted front desk and they have been very passive aggressive about it. Do these old people not know basic hostel etiquettes?? I think they just stopped caring unfortunately, and a bit of abuse on the \u201crespect the elderly\u201d principle by society. And for hostel management please treat your guests fairly no matter the age.",

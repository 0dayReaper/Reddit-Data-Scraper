    "postText": "Hi guys,\r  \n\r  \nI am hoping to work a ski season in Canada next winter. I (20M) am from the UK so dont know loads about how everything works.\r  \n\r  \nI have my IEC visa all sorted so am now looking to decide which resort I should work at.\r  \n\r  \nThe main things I am wondering about is:\r  \n\r  \nI have seen lots of post about how bad the accomodation situation is at lots of the big ski resorts like Whistler. Is this the case, should I just avoid the big ones if I want to save any money at all?\r  \n\r  \nDo i need a car if I want to work at smaller resorts e.g. Fernie or Revelstoke?\r  \n\r  \nShould I aim to work at the resort or just businesses in the towns?\r  \n\r  \nI want to go somewhere that is somewhat affordable but also has a good enough nightlife and where I will meet other young people?\r  \n\r  \nI also dont have any experience skiing - is this a problem? Would i be able to learn when I am there?\r  \n\r  \nAny recommendations or advice would be amazing.",

I wasn\u2019t going out drinking every single night but that wasn\u2019t the objective\u2026 I definitely had my fun and nights out etc and still managed fine without ending up net negative\n\nBUT this is dependant on securing staff accom, either through the mountain if that\u2019s where you\u2019re employed or through some local business that can provide it\n\nIf you can\u2019t get this then unfortunately privately renting will most likely just not be reasonable",

Say you get a job with no staff accommodation, finding a place to stay is going to be extremely expensive and near impossible on a short term lease (&gt; 1 year). \n\nMost resorts offer shuttles between the nearest airport/town to the ski hill. Majority of people from Aus/UK come down without a car so you\u2019d get by fine without one. A lot of people will buy a car at the end of the season and tour around the country afterwards.\n\nThere\u2019s nightlife at every single ski resort even the smaller ones among staff (especially if you\u2019re working for the hill). If you specifically want a better selection of clubs/bars head to Whistler or Banff, but it\u2019ll cost more $$$. \n\nNo you will learn to ski/board when you get here. Another reason to work for the hill is that they usually throw in a seasons pass even if say you\u2019re working in a cafe and not on the hill directly.\n\nIf you have anymore questions I\u2019m happy to answer! Have a ton of friends who have done ski seasons out here !",

            "comment": "As a Canadian, I'll say that most ski resorts are not known to be affordable. Canada is going through different housing/rental crises right now which does not help the situation either. What I will also say is that food/nightlife is also not the cheapest in Canada especially at ski resorts because a lot of resorts due to tourism have higher prices on most things. You are better off saving as much money as you can before coming. I've also been skiing for most of my life and even find that a weekend away/ski trip at most resorts is expensive. Also when it comes to great nightlife, have you considered working somewhere in the Alps? because many Alps resorts have hostels where you might be able to work in exchange for free accommodation which may help you save some money.",

They ALL prey on unsuspecting employees to travel long distances to work there because it's \"fun.\"\n\nThose visa employees are then committed to work, and are less likely to figure out the job sucks but cannot just leave.\n\nYou will not be able to save any money.  At all. Sorry.\n\nSki resort work is never 40 hours a week.  They over-hire then under-staff. Every time it's snowy or windy, you'll get sent home.  Each paycheck will be less than you need to live, especially with the cost of living and accommodation so high everywhere.\n\nYou will make less money than your neighbor who works at Mcdonalds. If you bring a lot of money with you to get through the season, you'll be okay, buy you'll still be broke come April.",

Staff get free access to these but inconsistently, and if you dont like back country powder skiing (lets be real, everyone likes it), then it might not be worth it.\n\nMight be worth looking into if you cant find a place anywhere else.",

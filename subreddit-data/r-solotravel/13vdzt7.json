    "postText": "I'm 26F and am planning my first long-haul solo backpacking trip. I'm planning a 6-8 month trip to include locations in SEA, Oceania, Europe, and Africa. As a solo backpacker on a budget obviously hostels are the best choice for accommodation, but I'm a little concerned about being a bother to other guests and that I might anger a lot of people. I've snored since I was a little kid, and my friends always point out how loud it is whenever we sleep in the same vicinity. I've stayed at capsule hotels and hostels the past couple years in Japan (where I live), and haven't had anybody approach me about it, but Japanese people are also very non-confrontational and probably wouldn't say anything even if it bothered them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess my big questions are\n\n1. If you are someone who snores, how have you navigated hostels and dormitory sleeping arrangements? And, has anybody ever had a bad reaction to your snoring?\n2. If you don't snore, how much does it really bother you when people snore in the hostels?\n\nAny opinions or help would be much appreciated!\n\nEdit 1: Thanks for all your replies, everybody! It's really helpful to hear everybody's differing opinions.\n\nSome context about my snoring: In college, I had roommates in the same room as me for 3 years. Most of the time they could sleep through it easily with earplugs or earphones. Some friends can sleep through it without any aids (ex-boyfriends and best friend for example), and most of the time my friends will be able to sleep through it, again, with earplugs. I've been woken up a handful of times and told to switch sleeping positions or drink water, but most of these times I was really drunk which I don't plan on drinking too heavily on this trip.\n\nSomebody said that when they plan on partying they reserve a private room, so I think if I plan on drinking I'll make sure to reserve a private room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: I will also be visiting a sleep doctor to try and get to the source of my snoring since many people have pointed out that generally loud snoring indicates health issues, and I've been snoring since I was about 4 or 5 so yeah probably something that needs to be done in addition to the usual \"lose weight, stop smoking and drinking\". So I'll be visiting a doctor and trying out a handful of aids to help with snoring and see which one works best",

            "comment": "If I\u2019ve learned anything over my years at many hostels, there are different types of snoring and some are more disruptive than others - not just total volume. \n\nThat all being said, it\u2019s a bit of a tough draw. I\u2019ll say I think almost anyone can agree, it is disruptive especially in a shared space. And yes, ideally I would love to not have any snorers in my room if possible. That being said, we all kinda know what we\u2019re signing up for in staying in a shared space, and ultimately that includes people who snore. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily take that people have not confronted you before as a signal that it\u2019s not disruptive but also, to some extent, you have as much a right as anyone to a dorm as well. \n\nThere are though, and I\u2019m sure perhaps you\u2019ve looked into, some over the counter options that may help alleviate some of the worst of the snoring. But don\u2019t be surprised if it is indeed really loud if you do eventually get some confrontation - if not direct. I\u2019ve definitely seen it happen.",

Usually, as long as I don't drink too much alcohol, drink plenty of water before bed, and sleep on my side it's not bad (according to my ex-boyfriend). It's also important to note that usually when I sleep in the same vicinity as my friends I'm usually quite drunk which I don't plan on drinking that much on the trip. Do you think it would be a good idea to apologize beforehand and keep some spare earplugs for anybody who doesn't have them?",

It makes me feel agitated and irritable, and the worst is when someone is an inconsistent snorer who will be going off like a warthog for 20 minutes and then stop for a while before starting up again because then it becomes harder to sleep as you\u2019re dealing with the anticipation of it starting up again. \n\nOn my most recent trip I didn\u2019t do enough research into earplugs and the ones I took were useless so I spent the majority of the time without being able to drown out snorers except with my headphones, but they weren\u2019t comfortable to sleep with. \n\nNext time I\u2019ll do better research and hopefully have good enough earplugs to not hear even the loud snorers. \n\nPersonally I think if you\u2019re fully aware that you snore excessively and you sleep in dorms anyway that makes you selfish. The other option is to do a sleep study and/or get some medical help for the problem as normally snoring (unless it\u2019s light) indicates health problems.\n\nI\u2019d recommend booking private rooms in hostels when you can if you still want the social aspect. You probably won\u2019t get loads of people actively confronting you about your snoring in dorms as that\u2019s a pretty aggressive thing to do and most people aren\u2019t gonna take the risk but I can say for sure it will annoy people and won\u2019t be appreciated at all.",

Coughing, snoring, sleep-talking, farting... that's all things you should pretty much expect when staying in a hostel. If that bothers you and you cannot sleep because of that, then YOU should get a private room. It's not the snorers job to make your life comfortable.",

I got used to it after a while and kept sleeping but two girls in the dorm found it annoying and kept waking up, talking about it and pacing back and forth and being annoyed about it. That kept me up more than the snoring. \n\nBut yeah, overall not a pleasant experience. I might snore too, not sure - no one\u2019s said anything to me about it. But it costs me my sleep as I\u2019m very conscious about it and try to do things like sleep on my side etc and I don\u2019t get much sleep. \n\nIt\u2019s made me reconsider hostels for a while.

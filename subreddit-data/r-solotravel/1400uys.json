    "postText": "I am in the early stages of planning a trip to Germany this August.  My plan is to spend 4-5 days in Munich and 4-5 days in the dolomites, but this is flexible and I may add a third location.  Does anyone have suggestions, tips, or anything similar?\n\nBudget:  $5k or so.  I would like to spend some time on a lake in the mountains, I enjoy waterfalls and mountains, maybe some short hikes, maybe a train tour or similar through the mtns, visit the dino museums, try some nice places to eat, see nice views, get a feel of living in some of the smaller towns there, perhaps go to a concert of some kind (classical or anything), visit some ren fairs (or whatever they call the little villages where you can see/participate in living like people did in ye olde days), see the countryside, or anything really.  I might rent a car and drive around or rely on public transportation, suggestions welcome. If it matters I've never been to germany and have only been to europe 3x.  I prefer more laid back and relaxing to rushed and touristy.\n\nThanks.",

I don't like this; I need another vacation after a vacation like this!  I prefer to go slow, take my time, slowly explore and be flexible on what I do and when, and just relax/rest/sleep more than usual.\n\nWhat would you suggest for a third location?  I am interested in history, dinosaurs, music, museums, food, or anything new to try.  I am pretty open.",

If you take the train from Munich via Stuttgart, make sure to enjoy the view you have when passing the city of Geislingen. The Stuttgart region has many beautiful vineyards, if you like walking on hills.\nIn the Schw\u00e4b'sche Alb, there is a project called Campus Galli, where they build a cloister like they would have in the middle ages, and only with the means of the middle ages. Super interesting.\n\nIf you would like to see another beautiful city, smaller but similar to Munich in style, visit Passau, the city where three rivers meet, close to the Austrian and Czech border.",

I would recommend heading to Salzburg from there it's a bit more quaint and you can explore outskirt areas that are quaint and because they celebrate Mozart and music/arts quite a bit you would be able to catch something in Salzburg. I was in Ljubljana Slovenia before I headed up to Munich, would highly recommend Slovenia for hikes around Triglav national park, was absolutely gorgeous and people were amazing.",

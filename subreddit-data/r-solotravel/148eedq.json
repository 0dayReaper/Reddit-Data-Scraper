    "postText": "Booked a week in Barcelona\n\nBarcelona is one of my fave places to visit and booked a week there in July, which will be the longest number of days I've been in the city consecutively. This trip, I was just looking to relax and not feel pressured to see everything since I've seen most of the major tourist destinations. Sagrada, Montseratt, La Rambla, the Mercado, Park Ugell, a few of the Gaudi houses, etc. \n\nI've never taken day trips outside of Barcelona, like to Stiges. I would like to check out some beaches, which I really haven't done in Barcelona. I've done them out of Madrid, but never Barcelona. I was debating if I should take two or three days and head up north to San Sebasti\u00e1n by plane, which I've heard mixed things about. If I did that, it seems like it's fairly easy - but cheaper to fly into Bilbao. Is it easy to get to San Sebasti\u00e1n? \n\nIs that a side trip worth considering, or would you just stay in Barcelona. If you have any recommendations of things to do or eat, I'll gladly take them. I will be solo this time. \n\nThank you.",

Get up early enough to see the sunset and chill there for a bit. \n\nGirona and Tarragona are also nice, and can be done as day trips via train. The Dali Museum in Figueres is also worth a visit if you're into that. \n\nSomeone else has mentioned Andorra, it's not a must see place but the views on the way are fantastic, and it's another country. You can either take the direct bus (lots of people go there for cheap shopping apparently) or do a tour (usually hitting Andorra and small towns in north Catalunya and the South of France). \n\nPlus Sitges and nearer beaches. Lots of good day trips from BCN.",

    "postText": "Hello fellow travelers! As a long-time lurker on this sub, I have thoroughly enjoyed reading about your diverse and exciting experiences. \r  \nToday, I wanted to spark a discussion about the coolest individuals you have met while traveling. For me, a cool person is someone who defies societal norms and chooses to live life on their own terms. I'm talking about those who have broken free from the mundane routine of working day in and day out just to get by.\r  \nInstead, I'm intrigued by those who have embraced a different path\u2014one where they work according to their passions and preferences, live without responsibilities and dependents, and navigate the world solo. These individuals are not merely existing on autopilot; they are deliberately crafting their lives and actively exploring the world.\r  \nSo, dear fellow travelers, I'm eager to hear your stories and encounters with these extraordinary souls. Who is the coolest person you have met during your travels? What made them stand out? How did their unique lifestyle inspire or influence you?",

            "comment": "I'm not going to answer your question.  I'm going to answer a different question.  (I find people who meet your definition of extraordinary generally don't have very good personalities or social skills).\n\nSo here is the different question I'm going to answer:\n\nWho is the most interesting individual you've encountered?\n\nI was staying in a dorm room in a hostel in Istanbul.  One of the guys in the room was an American who was in Istanbul to meet his dad for the very first time.\n\nHis mom was an American living in Iran, and was dating an Iranian guy.  Then the revolution happened and she was evacuated out of Iran.  After returning to the States, she discovered she was pregnant.  She had the baby and raised the baby as a single mother.\n\nNow, about 20 years later, the dad was able to travel to Turkey.  The son also traveled to Turkey to meet his dad.\n\nWhen I met the son he had just arrived in Istanbul.  He wasn't scheduled to meet his dad for another couple days.  He was clearly very excited and stressed.  The plan was that he would hang out with his dad for about a week, and then his mom would fly from the States to meet up with the two of them (seeing the father of her child for the first time in decades).  If things worked out between the mom and the dad, they would start the process of getting the dad to be allowed to immigrate to the States.\n\nI left Istanbul before he met his dad, but a month later I was talking to someone who had also met this guy, a week after I did.  He even helped out a bit as a translator between the son and the dad.  It was still early in the visit, but things seemed to be going well.",

            "comment": "There's something special about a person willing to get out of their own bubble, visit a different land, with a different language, and learn that culture. Travelers are the creme de la creme of humanity in my opinion. All of them are worthy of being called a friend and I have many I still keep in touch with.\n\nThat being said, I've met a handful of otherworldly people. I met a cool polyglot in Napoli, he spoke Japanese, Chinese, Italian, Spanish, Punjab, Arabic, English, German, and French. I literally watched him start conversation with everyone in the hostel in their native language. First and only time I wanted to be someone else haha. He was so cool! He even had the audacity to say he wished he was me when we shared stories. Yeah right!\n\nMet a couple bike-packing couple in Athens. Guy from Mexico and a girl from German met and fell in love, I forgot where, but decided to hike the world together. They were bikepacking a few years by the time I met them. They weren't digital nomads either, so their source of income was making handmade jewelry and selling them to people in the hostels and around the town. Their jewelry was some of the best I've ever seen too, so they definitely were invested in each other and their lifestyle. Super cool people.\n\nAnother guy I met in Amsterdam had sailed the world. He literally sailed from New Zealand to SEA and then to Europe. Idk if he was telling the truth but I definitely believed him. He was a little off, like he spent too much time alone, so I didn't think he was lying about it either.\n\nThen you have the Scandinavians, I'll just group them all together here cause they all party hard. I've never seen a human party that hard, do so many drugs, and then be up and sober before everyone else in the hostel. Like inhuman. They need to do a research study on these people lmao. All great people tho, they're fun to be with. \n\nI have to mention Brazilians as well. I think they're the nicest most welcoming and fun-loving people on the planet. Very mi casa es tu casa people, but on a bigger scale, mi ciudad es tu ciudad. I quite frankly felt like I was the adopted little brother every moment I was there. A truly wonderful people.",

Japanese are super respectful and conscientious of each other, truly should be a model for how people behave in this world.\n\nIceland is probably the most beautiful places I've ever been in terms of nature.\n\nMexico, Italy, and Vietnam have some of the best traditional foods. But I think the US has the best food in the world through combination of multiple cuisine options at a high quality.\n\nThe lifestyle in Spain and Portugal are one of my favorites in terms of drinking and food culture. Tapas is an alcoholics dream and, Vino Verde by day thick food to bring you down just to get back up again with a shot of port is amazing.\n\nBerlin, Paris, and Argentina are some of the worst experiences I've had while traveling. \n\nMexico City, Bogota, Barcelona, Prague, and Budapest had some of the best nightlife scenes I've ever been to. \n\nThere's a lot man.",

            "comment": "A few years ago, I loaded a bunch of camping gear onto my bicycle and spent the better part of the next seven months riding 5,300 miles (8,500 km) around the western US solo. Just a week or two before the coronavirus would put an early end to my trip, I was in the town of Sedona, Arizona. One day I was doing a bit of hiking on one of the many trails around town when I met Harold. I had asked him for directions back to the trailhead, but we ended up chatting for some time. He told me his hike that day was part of his training for the coming summer, when he planned to spend three weeks hiking the John Muir Trail, which connects Yosemite to California's highest peak through 200 miles (320 km) of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Oh, and Harold would turn 79 years old a month after we met.\n\nThroughout the course of my cross-country bike ride, it wasn't terribly uncommon, when I was eating lunch on a picnic table in a town park for example, for passers-by to come over and ask about [my rather eye-catching bike.](https://np.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/goucwl/i_didnt_get_around_to_making_trek_thursday_happen/) I celebrated my 21st birthday in the middle of my adventure, and so most of these people were somewhere between my age and Harold's. After I gave them a summary of where I'd come from and where I was going, I would often hear something to the effect of \"I wish I met you when I was your age. I wish I knew this was a thing when I was young enough to do it myself.\" I always hated hearing that because I knew there were people much older than me doing some incredible things.\n\nObviously I'm already inspired as a youngster to dream some impossible dreams and then dare to seek the possibilities that lie within. But I can only hope that in another 55 years or so, when I'm Harold's age, I'll still have half his drive to pursue these kinds of adventures.",

When I was in Myanmar, almost every conversation I struck up with a local ended up being extraordinarily deep and complex, about the political issues happening around them and you could tell these folks had very interesting past lives and I so wanted to spend more time with them to hear their stories. One time, I met a woman who told me her sister lived in the US near DC and she arrived to realize there was no Burmese to English dictionary so she made the first one and it is now in the US library of congress. Once, I was just chatting with the guy at the cell phone store and we struck up a very long convo about the political situation. These folks would be considered the intellectual elite, but lacked the freedom to speak openly in their country. I think it was important for them to be able to convey the oppression they were living with at least to get the message across to the world outside. They knew it would be safe to talk to me bc I was a foreigner.",

Told me about a community of similar people she used to meet in Laos that was destroyed by Chinese development and her time traveling in Afghanistan on the old hippy trail. Made me wish I paid more attention to German in school as the language barrier got in the way.",

Turns out she was married to the leader of the Flying Tigers, or the 2nd in command, can't remember now, but she had been invited to give a talk at a convention about her deceased husband. She told me that she lived on a ranch in Texas (I think) and that John Wayne would visit periodically, and her husband would take him on hunting trips for like a week or so. I think her husband was a technical advisor on the film Flying Tigers starring John Wayne. \n\nJust a tiny little older prim and proper lady sitting all alone in an airport. I'm glad I went to talk to her, she had some neat stories.",

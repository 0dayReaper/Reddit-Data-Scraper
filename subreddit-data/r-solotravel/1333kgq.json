    "postText": "Hi all,I am looking to do some travel to Tibet this year (likely August or September). I am a UK citizen with previous experience of going to China. \n\nI have done a bit of research online already but the Chinese visa application forms are a bit fuzzy on going to Tibet and I\u2019m unsure what the rules are since restrictions have lifted. Has anyone managed to get the right paperwork this year and did you encounter any problems?\n\nAlso while am fine with travelling solo, as Tibet is so vast and public transport relatively limited, if anyone can recommend an English speaking tour that would be great too. \n\nThanks in advance.",

The travel company organizes all the permits You need to obtain one before flying/train to Lhasa.  I picked mine up in Chengdu airport.  It's possible to travel around on your own inside the cities, but you need the permit to go anywhere, you can't take public transport.  the tour companies mix up groups, some went on to EBC/Nepal.\n\nThis is the tour I went on, they had English speaking guides. https://www.tibettravel.org/tibet-group-tours/6-days-lhasa-and-shigatse-tour.html\n\nTheir website says they're issuing permits to foreigners.",

I have been eyeing up the Intrepid Travel tour, but it is rather heavy on Lhasa (which I am not sure I would like, I imagine rubbing shoulders with packed-out Chinese tour groups) and I would rather see places like Mount Kailash and places meaningful to the Tibetans (which I get the Chinese are hardly likely to permit).\n\nI was under the impression that it would be very hard to find a local tour there and doing so would just cause problems for Tibetans. I am eager for any information, so feel free to private message me.",

                    "comment": "I have been doing some more research recently and I feel like that while Lhasa and true Tibet would be amazing, it is a right hassle to get around anywhere and the distances are truly vast, making independent  travel not impossible, but fairly impractical unless you have loads of time.\n\nInstead I am now planning on going to the Sichuan side, especially in the area around Kangding which is supposed to be stunning in its own right. It\u2019s also a Tibetan city, but it\u2019s only 4 hours from Chengdu and doesn\u2019t need all the extra red tape and hassle.  It should be said though that I am hopefully going to meet up with a Chinese friend so I might not be totally solo but in China I think having a local tag along is very worthwhile.",

The ideas was to travel across northern China and then enter Sichuan from the north via Qinghai province, although that also came with problems. \n\nThe plus point was you can see a lot of interesting stuff that way, but it\u2019s also well of the beaten track. The path from Qinghai to Sichuan crosses the dangerous Aba marshes, and as you\u2019re crossing several Tibetan and Qiang majority regions, the Chinese state makes it difficult to travel the area. One estimate says that around 20% of the population of the capital Xining are prisoners of some kind or another. That makes getting across the province and into Sichuan much more challenging.\n\nI definitely agree that having a local tag along is a very good idea or, failing that, someone with very good general knowledge of China.",

    "postText": "I just had a complete scare. Im still shaking half an hour later.\n\nIm a solo traveler, female in my mid 20s. I\u2019ve been traveling for almost 3 months now in Thailand, Vietnam and now Indonesia. I meet friends in all the cities I go to but half the time im traveling from place to place alone. \n\nI\u2019ve been in Indonesia for 2 weeks already and today Ive spent 10 hours traveling from one island to the next. I was in a 30 minute grab with a man, the last part of my travel day before getting to my hostel. It was night time, close to midnight. He was immediately quite friendly, asking me what I plan on doing in this city. Normal chit chat in a taxi. \n\nThen he starts asking me personal questions that rarely I get. How old are you, are you traveling alone, are you meeting friends at the hostel, do you have a boyfriend, \u201ci want you to come sit in the front seat next to me\u201d. I told him no and he proceeds to ask for my Instagram. I told him no. Then he \u201crates the drive\u201d even though we had 15 minutes left. This effectively completed the drive on my end. I could no longer see the route or use any of the help features on the app. This is when I started to panic.\n\nI told him to pull over and said I needed to get out of the car. He asked why and I said I was going to throw up. I tried faking that I was gagging. He seemed hesitant and confused at first but eventually pulled over. \n\nI get out of the car and quickly grab my bags from the trunk and he gets upset. He said \u201cwhat are you doing? No! Come back\u201d and I told him he was creepy and I\u2019m getting a new ride. \n\nthere were two other men nearby outside a closed warung, one holding a small child, and I guess the fact that they had a toddler felt safe to me so I walked to them. He pulled his car around and walked over to us all. He starts talking in Indonesian to them and the other men laugh and smirk. \n\nHe\u2019s trying to convince me to get back in the car. He\u2019s apologizing, asking what he did wrong, PLEADING me to let him take me to my destination. \n\nHe swore that the reason he completed the drive early was so he could accept a new passenger. \n\nFor 5 minutes he tries to plead with me, telling me he\u2019s not a criminal and he\u2019s sorry and to get back in the car. The other men are still laughing occasionally and talking with him in Indonesian throughout our conversation. I felt like a fool. My whole body was shaking.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. I felt trapped and felt like no one cared how I felt and I felt belittled because I knew they were all making fun of me in their language. I got back in his car and we didn\u2019t talk the rest of the ride. \n\nHe dropped me off at my hostel but then he came inside and started talking to the ladies at reception, in Indonesian. 1 girl continued to check me in, and 2 other girls stepped away from the desk listening to him. They were talking for at least 5 minutes, the whole time I was getting checked in. I knew they were talking about me and he was telling them what happened in the car, even though the one girl checking me in said \u201cno, he\u2019s not talking about you.\u201d \n\nWhile the one girl walked me to my dorm I told her what happened and she just says \u201coh\u201d in an acknowledging way and then proceeded with the hostel rules and details. I felt so dismissed. She left and I started crying.\n\nI have not ONCE felt unsafe my entire time solo traveling until tonight. I\u2019ve been hit on, I\u2019ve had locals call after me and follow me as I walk by trying to get my Instagram or take photos of me. I\u2019ve had guys and taxi drivers ask me a few of those same questions but they always knew when to stop and I never felt like it was anything other than playful or curiosity. But with my grab driver tonight I really just felt it was different. All the alarm bells were going off in my head. \n\nMy friend was raped (not in this country, but a country that is considered very safe for female backpackers) by a local while solo traveling. Back in my home country, all of the women closest to me have been sexually assaulted. I have been sexually assaulted. 5 of my close friends have been raped. \n\nI know cultures are different. But I do not consider myself to be some naive tourist who takes everything personally and is dramatic. I\u2019ve had men in these countries do creepy stuff that would never fly in my home country - but I know most of it is innocent and harmless. But tonight felt so different down to my core.\n\nI feel so belittled, demeaned, dismissed. I feel like I completely misread a situation yet my whole body was telling me to jump out of that car and get away from that man. And I would at least think the lady at the hostel would show concern but even she blew me off it seems. My legs were shaking so hard I couldn\u2019t even walk well. \n\nI just had to get this off my chest. \n\nUpdate - the ladies at my hostel just messaged me and apologized for what happened in the car. They said they were trying not to show concern because that man was talking angrily with the 2 other ladies who worked at the hostel, and was raising his voice at them. They told me his behavior was inappropriate and illegal as a grab driver and to rate him 1 star. I\u2019m honestly scared to because of retaliation - he knows I am staying at this hostel for a few days.",

Almost always lie or omit information they don\u2019t need and no need to feel bad about it. There may be people who are trying to just make conversation or be friendly, but there\u2019s no need to give them so much personal information. If you become friends later on when you know it\u2019s safe, they won\u2019t be mad that you lied. It\u2019s for your personal safety and most people understand that.\n\nI always say I\u2019m meeting someone and they\u2019re already waiting for me, that they know I\u2019m in a cab/rideshare. I never tell them too much information about what I\u2019m going to do next or where I will be or I make something up. Even if something doesn\u2019t happen in the taxi, that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t come back later or tell friends about you. As a solo female traveler, you can have a ton of fun but you also need to stay extra vigilant so you\u2019re not harmed. Always keep local emergency numbers on you. Hope you feel better!",

            "comment": "I had a scary experience when I was in the Philippines, in Bohol. I took a tuktuk to a beach bar with a group of people from the hostel, we were 5km away from our hostel. After a couple of hours I felt really tired and sleepy but nobody wanted to get back to the hostel yet so I walked to the end of the beach where you can get a motorcycle taxi. I told the driver the name of my hostel and hopped on his bike. During the drive he also started asking me really uncomfortable questions: \u201cDo you have a boyfriend? Why are you alone? Where is your boyfriend\u201d. That was the moment when I realized that I\u2019m on a motorbike with a complete stranger, that nobody saw who I left with, that it\u2019s midnight so it\u2019s dark, the island roads are empty and my iPhone is in my backpack so I can\u2019t even check if he is driving me in the right direction. I lied to him that I went out with my friends and that my boyfriend was feeling sick and that\u2019s why he stayed behind at our hostel and that he was waiting for me there now. \n\nI got to my hostel safely, paid for the ride and never saw the driver again. Now that I look back at that interaction I don\u2019t think that guy had any bad intentions. But it was still very scary for me. It was 6 years ago and I still think about it often.\n\nDon\u2019t feel stupid. Your concerns were not baseless. I got groped by a taxi driver once when I sat in the front seat of the car. I\u2019ve never felt so powerless. What do you do in this situation? Jump out of the car?\n\nGood on you that you refused to move to the front seat. There was no good reason to ask you to move so close to the driver. If he wanted to talk he could talk to you while you were seating in the back of the car. There is a chance that he wasn\u2019t planning anything sinister, but you are not a mind reader. You felt unsafe and chose to remove yourself from the situation. It\u2019s the right thing to do in this case. \n\nStay safe!",

Don\u2019t know if this is useful to you, but I find it important - especially when travelling in foreign countries - to be able to make a decision and stick to it regardless of social pressure. Specifically I think you should have walked off as soon as you got out of the car or, if that was not an option, perhaps ignored him completely while going on your phone. Regardless if you or him were right. It\u2019s such a common thing when travelling in Asian or Latin American countries for people to pester you for ages if you deny their services for whatever reason. Often there\u2019s a language barrier and things happen fast, so you need to make a decision on a whim. He might have been a creep or you might have misunderstood. Either way I\u2019d say once you\u2019ve made a decision, don\u2019t let anyone else get in your head and change it because 1) trust your gut, 2) better safe than sorry and 3) you\u2019ll come out looking confused and like a push over who is not in control and thus can be taken advantage of. A big part of solo travelling is faking confidence and pretending to know what you\u2019re doing when out and about \u2014 at least until you reach safer grounds",

The drivers need not know any personal details about you so I think it\u2019s justifiable to lie in situations that makes you uncomfortable.  However, generally drivers are just chatty because they\u2019ve been driving all day and no one to talk to but their customers, it\u2019s just annoying when they lead to being too personal and specially when you\u2019re already tired and want some peace and quiet.

That list of questions I get asked at least once a week (they dont seem to realize its creepy to ask a woman if she lives alone - to be honest they are generally just so suprised a person, esp a woman is doing something alone because in Indo everything is a group activity and women are usually not alone, almost noone lives/ travels alone here).\n\nWhen you got out of the car and went over to the other men (with the kid) they were laughing because they were nervous. It is infuriating, but it is the almost universal response I get when anything like this happens. The Taxi driver lost face and the men were embarrassed for him and started laughing to diffuse the situation. The people at the hostel also behaved in an unsupportive way likely in a similar mode (at least they didnt laugh).\n\nI may be mistaken but IMO dont think the grab driver had any malcontent - I do recommend you give him 1 star and give feedback to GRAB because he should NOT have asked you to end the ride early like that. Grab takes the feedback seriously and he will likely get in trouble. He knows that and was doing all the begging to try save his ass. \n\nYou did the right thing here - dont be feeling bad, it was a shitty situation caused by the Grab driver not you. I'm sorry this happened, I hope it doesnt spoil your enjoyment of the rest of your time here :(",

Just because it\u2019s SE Asia does not make Indonesia the same as Vietnam.  A lot of criminal activity comes out of Indonesia. There are serious terrorist factions there. It is also has a very large Muslim population, which unfortunately often translates to men feeling they can do whatever they like toward women. \n\n3. I lie about many things while overseas. Even to other travelers. You honestly do not know who you are really talking to most of the time. \n\n4. The fact that you say you have always felt safe and then rattled off a few things that should have been red flags worries me. You don\u2019t need to walk around afraid all the time, but I think you have let your guard down too much. Especially when you first get to a new area, play things very safe. Because at the end of the day, you are still a wealthy (by their standards) western female traveling alone. A perceived very easy target to anyone with the slightest criminal intent.",

One thing I will advise, just for the future, is never let doubt or fear of coming off rude or silly compel you to put yourself back into a situation that your gut is telling you is unsafe. There was absolutely no reason to get back into that car, no matter how much the guy begged. And yeah, you turned out to have ultimately gotten to where you needed to go this time, but how often do you think people go against their gut just for fear of being rude or making a scene and end up suffering for it? There's absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about, feeling you 'misread' the situation. That sense we have that something's off has evolved millions of years to help us avoid danger. Too few people listen to that sense and end up in a bad way as a result. You listened which is great but you should always follow through. And there may well be false positives, but those are a small price to pay to steer clear of actual danger.",

As a (gay) man I have unfortunately been privy to a few guys lockerroom type conversations and have witnessed enough bad behavior. I am firstly a big advocate of self defense courses. Night taxi while traveling is discombobulating at best so its not surprising you allowed yourself to be drawn into conversation with the driver. Self preservation often requires lies and a little performance. Who cares if it's 'not nice'? You want a go to story for such situations. Having it loosely prepared gives it the requisite confidence. The next time you recognize a self-centered jerk is in your space, whip out your few \"details\" and close the conversation politely but firmly and don't back down. Asking a question can change the dynamic too. Having something to read or look at helps. Using the telephone can actually make one less aware of surroundings so maybe not a good idea unless calling for potential help. Regardless of their question or statement: \"I've just left a small family get together and I'm catching up to my partner and some friends. Are the roads always this bumpy?\" Says you have lots of support, are aware of surroundings, and not interested in what they're talking about. Plausibility and overthinking is for victims. If they say something else ask another question and say thank you. Don't let them ramble on - it's manipulation. They're wearing you down and confusing you. This was not your fault. Stay safe.",

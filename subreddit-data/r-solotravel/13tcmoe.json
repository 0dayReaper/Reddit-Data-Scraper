    "postText": "Hello, I'm a solo traveller looking to head into hawaii next for my trip of 2-2.5 months. It will be my first time in the US and very far away from home without knowing a single soul there. I am looking to save A LOT OF costs as simply the ticket price would be 2K USD if not more - plus I know how expensive hawaii is as well. I am looking at doing work exchanges/volunteering exchanges or house sitting. But I don't seem to be getting very good responses - maybe because I've never experienced countryside life before?\n\nI really wish to tho I know its very contrasting from my growing up experiences. I'm from Singapore, we only have the city life here.\n\nMy first and only other solo trip without a group was to Thailand where I paid an organization 200USD for a 4 week volunteering stint as an English teacher at a primary school. However, it got shortened to 2 weeks only and the other 2 weeks I was lucky enough to have a family friend host me - I doubt I'd have such luck in a foreign place so far away. I really do want to expand my horizons and travel again. I felt so different. And felt like I came back a new person due to all I experienced in that 5 week trip to Thailand. As if, I never did grew up in Singapore. And I realize, I could learn to trust myself and become my own person. When I'm here in my home country, near family - I feel like I lose a sense of self sometimes.\n\nI don't have a full time job nor do I earn money conventionally. Hence why, I'd like to save costs and get to travel longer. Singapore Passports only allow up to 90 days of free visa travel for holidays, so nothing above that unless I continue flying into other countries.\n\nI would also like to reach out to people whom have had such experiences travelling, volunteering and doing these exchanges/house sitting and would like to hear ur tips, advices and experience! Or maybe even how you found work overseas/online while travelling at the same time! How you presented yourself and create connections so that people ended up choosing you over others etc , and also whether you could find / make friends with others in this line of work.\n\n I am hoping to find a few people who may be interested in doing this sort of exchange with me too. I don't drive at all and that's something that concerns me if I went to hawaii. And definitely getting to know someone new (and maybe even get go live with them for a short time) could help me heal and establish more positive / trusting relationships in future. I've only had very disappointing friendships in my life so far. Many people in my life (myself included) tend to have trust issues - maybe it's also cause of our culture/upbringing that teaches us to only rely on thyself and constantly compete with others. Hence why establishing trust and intimacy is a luxury only a few actually have in SG. Thanks for reading.",

If you are on a right budget you could do two months or more in SE Asia staying at hostels, eating tasty food and actually seeing lots of things and enjoying yourself.  Good luck.",

I agree that travelling is a great way to expand your horizons, particularly growing up in a small place like Singapore. But you should consider something a little closer to home that will be cheaper but will still be different to city life in Singapore.\n\nIf you don't have the means to support yourself you may not get through the border. Have you looked into options for working visas you may qualify for? Staying longer somewhere is more likely to let you build the friendship you are after.",

            "comment": "American here. Hawaii is one of, if not the single most expensive state in the USA. It is also small. If you\u2019re on a very tight budget it is not the place to go.\n\nI would advise against the USA in general at the moment, unless you get a very good work opportunity. It\u2019s extremely expensive. But if you\u2019re dead set on the states, your best bet is to just find a bartending/serving gig wherever you go. You make much more in those roles in the states due to tips. $20-30/hr roughly. Cash tips will be under the table as well so you avoid income tax. Even so, rent is usually $1400/mo or more in any given city so you\u2019re maybe going to break even on that with a small amount to spare. And to even initiate all of this, you need to secure a work visa, unless you want to bank on immigration not giving you any trouble and a restaurant/bar being desperate enough to hire someone illegally.\n\nAlso in the USA healthcare is not public. If you get injured or require it, you will end up owing tens of thousands of dollars. A lot of people don\u2019t think about this, but coming unprepared and unemployed is a recipe for disaster.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019d recommend thinking it through a bit more and going somewhere else. Pretty much anywhere else.",

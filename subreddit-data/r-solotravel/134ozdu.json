    "postText": "I will be travelling to northern India next week for just over two weeks. I know most people will think that's ridiculous due to the serious heat this time of year, but its the only time I have available unfortunately. Here's my Itinerary:\n\n-9th arrive in Jaipur late night. 3 days here.\n\n-13th train to New Delhi\n\n-14th day trip to Agra to visit the Taj Mahal, return to Delhi in evening.\n\n-15th day in Delhi\n\n-16th train to Haridwar\n\n-16th-21st discovering Haridwar and Rishikesh\n\n-22nd train back to Delhi\n\n-23rd day in Delhi\n\n-24th flight home\n\nI love discovering the history and culture of each country I visit. From my research these seem the most interesting places to visit on a tighter schedule as they are relatively 'close' to each other with reliable transport routes. They're also steeped in history with many things to do and see.\n\nI don't have much interest in staying in Agra that's why i think a day trip is the best option. Are trips to the Taj worth booking through a tour company with a guide? I'm leaning towards this as it will be less hassle than sorting it myself and a bit more comfortable (even if more expensive)\n\nHow reliable are the trains and should I be booking them now before I go, a week or so in advance?\n\nRealistically how much will I be able to do in the day time or will the heat put a stop to my plans?\n\nThis is my first time in India. I am relatively well travelled, travelling in south east Asia for more than 18 months. However i do realise India is a whole other level of intensity and can be quite testing.\n\nI'm super excited but would really appreciate some feedback / advice on the itinerary plan and anything you think would be useful for me to know before i set off. (I don't know if relevant but I'm 31 y/o male)\n\nThanks!!!",

You are covering some of my favorite cities in India - Jaipur, Haridwar, and Rishikesh.\n\nPlease try and book first class/air conditioned coaches in the train; many tourists aren\u2019t aware of the difference and book second class non-AC seats and sometimes enter the \u201cunreserved\u201d compartments (think: Southwest Airlines - sit anywhere, first come first served, except, since this is a train, tickets are oversold; there are monthly pass passengers as well, so you can never find out the exact count; so, you will end up in a hot crowded train car if you don\u2019t reserve the train tickets in advance. And as another comment says: train tickets get filled in advance, so do that asap.)",

Waste of time. Then you see the attitude on their faces when you don't buy. Stick to your guns and don't fall under the pressure.\n\nI'm said, \"the pricing for your services attract people like me who do not have a lot of money to spend. It doesn't make sense to bring me to a shop to spend money I do not have.\" \n\nI was hoping that would work.....but he still brought me to another shop afterwards. To be fair though, he probably has every shop pre-scheduled with his business partners.\n\nLong story short, hire the more expensive tour guides. they will likely not waste your time with their side hustles.",

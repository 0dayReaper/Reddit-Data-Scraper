Is it enough time? or should I book flight at 8AM just in case of immigration control?I am planning to do Salkantay Trek 5 days. \r  \n\r  \nDay 1. Arriving at Lima on 29 at 10PM and flying straight to Cusco on May 30th at 5 or 8AM.\r  \nDay 2. May 30th Arriving in Cusco around 8-10AM = Exploring Cusco and looking to buying trip to Salkantay Trek (5 days)\r  \nDay 3. May 31 and Acclimatization.\r  \nDay 4-9. June 1-5 . Starting salkantay trek 5 days and comeback to hotel on June 5.\r  \nDay 9. June 6. Sacred Valley or Rainbow Mountain? If so, should I just book mini trip in Cusco or how can I get there? Taxi?\r  \n\r  \nDay 10. June 7. Flight back to Lima by 4PM, and flight from Lima at 11PM back home.\r  \n\r  \nShould be enough time for immigration control + boarding for next flight? 5-7 hours between flight? It is the same airport.\r  \nI will be trekking for 5 days/4 nights, so I don't need to book for 5 days any hotels in Cusco right? I will be traveling just with backpack, so will carry all my staff.\r  \nBuying sim-card with data possible in Cusco? Or they have some places with public WiFi?\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n^(TRIP DETAILS)\r  \n\r  \n^(5 DAYS SALKANTAY TREK SUMMARY)\r  \n\r  \n^(Start point: Cusco, hotel pick up from 4:30 to 5:00 am)\r  \n\r  \n^(Pick up: at Machu Picchu reservations office at 5:00 am)\r  \n\r  \n^(Ending point: Cusco city center \u2013 Plaza Regocijo)\r  \n\r  \n^(Duration: 5 days \u2013 4 nights)\r  \n\r  \n^(Departure: Daily departures)\r  \n\r  \n^(Group size: Up to 16)\r  \n\r  \n^(Duffle Bag: Included (7 kg capacity))\r  \n\r  \n^(Machu Picchu tickets: included in the package -CHECK DETAILS HERE-)\r  \n\r  \n^(Meals included: 5 Breakfasts, 4 lunches, 4 dinners)\r  \n\r  \n^(Vegetarian/vegan: Food available upon request at no extra charge)\r  \n\r  \n^(Free storage: Available)\r  \n\r  \n^(Price: $300. via returning by train or $230 by car.)\r  \nShould I book this trip online just in case it will be sold out? or finding that trip in Cusco will be no problems and could be even cheaper?\r  \n\r  \nThanks.",

            "comment": "You can never be sure how the altitude will affect you. Speaking from my own experience, it has nothing to do with how in-shape you are. I have been above 4000 in the peruvian Andes quite a few times. \n\n5 years ago I was in pretty bad shape considering, but had no problem flying in to huaraz and doing a three day hike. It was exhausting but I felt fine healthwise.\n\nRight now I'm in pretty much perfect shape. Excercise daily and 12% body fat. In march I flew into Cusco, and did Salkantay on the third day after arriving. Resting back at camp the first afternoon I became as nauseous as I've ever been. Next morning I had 85% O2 saturation and had to go up to the pass by mule.\n\nMorale of the story: your acclimatisation time is on the short side. Especially on such a tightly planned trip.\n\nOh, and I would way prefer the Sacred Valley over Rainbow Mountain. Vinicunca is just a photo opportunity at the end of a pretty boring route. Ollantaytambo and P\u00edsac are wonderful towns. Especially P\u00edsac seems to have come through the pandemic and the recent drop in tourism alright. The mysticism crowd (pachamamosos as they call them) keeps the dollars flowing in.",

            "comment": "-5 am flight will be fine\n-I would do sacred valley first to get you acclimatized then do Salkantay. \n-You can buy a SIM card with data in Cusco. Public Wi-Fi is easy though I never got a SIM card and I was in SA for six months\n-You can also do the Salkantay trek without a guide. My best friend and I did it just us two last summer, book a trip with someone to take you to  Lake Humantay and just do it yourself if you want to save trouble money and time! We got the train from Aguascalientes back to Cusco it was quite lovely. Otherwise find a trekking place that is leaving on the same day you want to leave",

The Lima airport is efficient, especially compared to many US airports.\n\nRecommend Sacred Valley, not Rainbow Mountain. Ollantaytambo was small and rather charming, and Pisac was interesting too. \n\nFlights of out Cusco are sometimes cancelled in the afternoon due to wind. Since you\u2019re flying home that evening, I would book a morning flight to Lima.",

            "comment": "I had an almost identical itinerary planned when I visited Peru last year. I ended up doing a Sacred Valley tour (definitely recommend) and scrapping everything else because I found myself so sick from altitude.  Like, sicker than I'd been in years. Your plan could work out completely fine or it could end up falling through. It just depends on how your body handles acclimating to elevation. \n\nWith that said, look into preventative measures to help make the adjustment easier on you. I regret not preparing my body enough for such a rapid change  (There are plenty of meds for this) and hopefully others can learn from my mistakes. Despite all of this, I still look back at my time in Peru fondly. If you end up doing the Trek, be sure to buy it there and wait until you know your body is ready for it so you don't lose a ton of money. If you do find yourself having extended health issues like I did, try to venture to a town at lower elevation or with a more humid climate (Such as Aguas Calientes). Regardless of the outcome, you'll have a great time and meet some amazing people! \n\nAssuming you don't have any trouble with acclimating, your itinerary looks fine to me. Just know that a ride from Aguas Calientes (where the Salkantay trek typically ends) to Cusco can take half a day so leave room for that. Also, the Salkantay Trek won't drop you off at Machu Picchu, so if you want to see that you'll have to make time for it separately from my understanding. Maybe a 4-day Trek plan with an additional day at Machu Picchu would be a better fit with a day of rest afterwards on the train back. Hopefully this info helps!",

            "comment": "When flying from Lima to Cusco, sit on the port (left) side of the plane to gaze at the Andes. Be sure tonuse seatguru to make sure your view is not obstructed by the plane's wing. Try sitting in rows 6 and under close to the front of the plane.\n\nIf you can do the Humantay Lake hike, it's worth a gander. They have mules for rent to take you up the steep hill(recommended). \n\nI didn't do rainbow mountain because of the weather at the time. A lot of photos/videos that you see on the internet are digitally enhanced to make the colors more vibrant than they actually are (liars). \n\nThe tour guide said it also depends on how much light there is, clouds, rain, if it rained the previous day, etc. \n\nAs far as altitude sickness goes....best give yourself 2 days to acclimate. Altitude sickness is random because you can be an Olympian and still get it. Science has not been able to pinpoint an exact reason. \n\nI luckily only got a headache while others in my group experienced light headedness. We all had higher heart rates than usual, but that's normal.\n\nWe also started taking chlorella supplements to increase our production of red blood cells 3 months before our travel to Cusco. Did it help? We have no idea because we didn't bother with before/after blood work. \n\nNone of us needed to take Diamox(altitude sickness pill), which was prescribed to us by our health insurer. We just had it as a backup in case we had serious symptoms.",

I acclimated for three days in Urubamba and one in Cusco before I started hiking.  I had no issues with the altitude. If you want to treat yourself after your trek, Tambo del Inka in Urubamba is incredible!!  I got an esim from Holafly. No service on the trail.  Enjoy!  Salkantay Trail and Humantay Lake look amazing!",

However, that was just my experience, and I don't think you should risk it. Booking there tours in Cusco is a lot cheaper than from Viator or GetYourGuide.",

I was away for 4 months to the other side of the world, been back for 3 weeks now and sometimes it feels like it never even happened. Trying to not slip back in the old ways but it's getting hard to do. Anyone know how to deal with that?",

It was awesome, it felt like i belonged somewhere. When i got back i felt so depressed and sad. I started to cry as soon as i got home. I had to go back to my old job that i hated, just because i didnt have any money. (Currently writing this at work) I also have a feeling like did it ever even happen. So you are not alone in this. I only have 2 weeks left and then im quitting my job. Im thinking about moving to Italy to study. My home country just doesnt feel like home anymore.",

To be honest I\u2019ve realised that the issues existed before travelling- don\u2019t think it is a good stereotype that travelling can fix everything. I\u2019ve found talking to someone has really helped, trying replicate things I liked travelling into my normal life. It is a work in progress but its getting a bit better.\n\nStill planning on travelling again as soon as money allows like! \ud83d\ude43",

You've been abroad, it felt freeing and wonderful and you've seen and done incredible things -\n\nAnd now you have returned, home. Where everything is a bit the same and not particularly exciting. You have work or school back here, you have responsibilities.\n\nHow to deal with it? Honestly I just look onwards to the next trip, start deciding what i will ne foing during that, and remind myself that the only way I can afford to travel is by being back home and working.",

It's more like an adventure. \n\nFor me at least, I found trying to make life back at home more like travelling helps. Try out new restaurants, go on weekend trips with friends, try to live more spontaneously. Just because you're back at home doesn't mean the adventure stops, but it takes effort.",

I suppose it's the excitement of going away and experiencing new things and then you get home and everything seems bland and a bit dull. I know a few of my friends said something similar when they were travelling and doing regular city breaks at weekends when they were in their 20s.\n\nI think it's hard if you live in a small regional town with not much to do at weekends. It's hard to keep doing exciting things at the weekend so going on trips abroad provides that stimulation and chance to experience something different.",

            "comment": "The trick is to bring what you liked about vacation back. Go to a Vietnamese restaurants. Buy some posters or prints of French countryside. And don't be an idiot. I've seen more people talk about how backwards and bad people are in the home country. No one likes someone who talks about how much better somewhere else is.\n\n99% of what you liked is being free of work, home and the mundane chores. But no matter where you live, life is still pretty much, work, eat, sleep. And seeking a therapist if you still have issues. Traveling doesn't take care of mental problems. It only pushes them away for a while. Been there, done that.",

It's not like i hate being back or the people around me, it's just that i was severely depressed before i left (therapy never really helped) and during my trip for the first time i was happy. Just trying to keep that feeling going and make adjustments to my life for that but the everyday slur is harder to deal with now that I've seen what's possible. But yh trying to find new things to do here is a great start i guess.",

    "postText": "I have this problem, and well I'd say I've had it for several years now since near the end of my time at university.\n\nI feel like a totally different person when I'm abroad, like I feel liberated and have a far easier time having fun and meeting new people to hang out with. Life just seems to have an extra zest that it lacks  when I'm at home. Sometimes, while I am obviously a citizen of my country, I just feel so different to most other people when it comes to outlook, enjoyment of particular things, and elements of the culture. I often feel like I don't fit in, but I feel more like a citizen of nowhere, or maybe a citizen of everywhere else but here?\n\nI was wondering if anyone else feels like this, and if they do, how do they mitigate these feelings?\n\nI was all set to go and leave this country, literally would have been any day now had it not been for Covid-19. I had a WHV ready and everything, I was going to go explore and live abroad again, and maybe stay abroad for several years if I was able to find work (probably start with English teaching for visa purposes).\n\nI'm kind of sad that it could be a very long time until I can do those things. In the past 8 months I have moved to a new city for a contract job which was initially only for 6 months (short rental lease too), so I could top up my funds ready to go. I met some nice people, but nothing really on a friendship level, my city had very few social events, and now 0 given Covid. I guess maybe some element of loneliness is there...\n\nI kind of find myself at a juncture where I need to either hold on and ride it out, then leave, or start building a life that I know I will abandon at the first chance. Urgh.",

I'm far more withdrawn, and I don't like it.  But I've always struggled at breaking out of my shell.",

When at home it can be really tough to start a conversation as people go on with their busy days. They are just thinking about themselves and what they need to get finished.

It can be very depressing and frustrating to live somewhere with fundamentally different values. I don't for a second think that the grass is wholly greener elsewhere, but I am choosing to pursue life in another country where day-to-day lifestyle matches with my values. Things like public transit and walking vs. long commutes in a car. \n\nI tried to recreate at home as much of what I love about life and my identity in Central Europe, and it was a hilarious disaster most of the time. For example, I'm an introvert in my home life, but I love dancing at European clubs until morning. Clubs in my current city close by 2 a.m., are disproportionately populated by creepy guys, can't compare in quality of  music, and are located in places where taxis and Ubers are prohibitively expensive. \n\nIn simpler terms, my absolute favorite thing is the very basic act of just walking around cities alone. It's too dangerous in my city due to crime and lack of infrastructure. \n\nIt's ok to be critical of how your surroundings impact you. I would suggest that you try to learn as much as you can about your values and preferences so you can choose to live somewhere that daily life doesn't drain you. Just don't forget to be grateful for what you do have right now.",

            "comment": "I don't know if this analogy will help, but...\n\nI've worked for the same company for almost a decade. I helped start it, and have been heavily involved in building it from the beginning. I am *very* familiar with nearly everything the company does, the problem space we operate in, our solutions, their limitations, the inner workings of our systems and policies, etc.\n\nWhat all of this familiarity occasionally leads to a sense of paralyzation. I know *so much* about what we're doing that any new idea slams immediately against every possible way that it might fail, and every existing idea is coated in layer after layer of context.\n\nThis isn't necessarily a bad thing. This knowledge helps me make ultimately better decisions about the work I'm doing and how I do it. But it can make the whole thing feel \"heavy\" at times -- hard to navigate freely -- and it can take effort to remove myself from that in order to think in a more open, flowing way.\n\nMeanwhile, if someone approaches me with a new business idea or a brand new concept that they'd like to flesh out that is unrelated to my regular work...I will be practically gushing with ideas. They'll come flying out of me rapid-fire, each idea leading to the next in a seemingly never-ending string of things to try or think about or experiment with or flesh out.\n\nSo if we try to apply that analogy to travel...\n\nYour home is like my company. You know so much about it. You know all of the limitations and restrictions. You know why taking a walk outside this afternoon might not be that interesting. You know that there aren't any events happening downtown tonight that are really up your alley. You've been to all of the restaurants. You know many of the people and what they like to talk about, what's big on the news, what the general consensus might be on this or that topic.\n\nThis is all *good* in some ways. You're likely able to operate very skillfully and efficiently at home. You know how to do X or Y -- who to call, what to say, how to manage it, etc.\n\nBut it can feel \"heavy\" -- like a box that you're stuck in. It doesn't feel as \"wide open\" because everywhere you look, there's another thing that you've seen 1,000 times before, and idea you've heard 1,000 times before, etc. Your familiarity -- while useful -- can make it feel hard to navigate freely.\n\nThen you jump on a plane and fly halfway around the world and what do you know! Unfamiliar things! No idea what's around the next corner! New restaurants! A tree you've never seen before! A language you don't speak! Customs you're not familiar with!\n\nIt's green fields everywhere you look, and suddenly you feel nimble and quick and responsive and full of ideas.\n\nThat's because you don't already know the end result of those ideas. You don't know what will happen when you walk up to that stand to order that unfamiliar street food. You don\u2019t know what will happen if you jump on the subway. You don't know what will happen when you walk out of the door of your b&amp;b in the morning morning.\n\n*You don't know*, and that feels like freedom.\n\nHere's the catch, though. The longer you stay in that new place, the more you'll learn. The more you'll realize that walking down *that* alley leads to a dead end while that *other* alley is the quickest way to get to that smoothie shop you like.\n\nYou'll learn what's on the minds of the people in the area. You'll notice patterns. You'll learn how to say this or how to respond to that. You'll learn what things go over well and what things don't. You'll learn what's worth the money and what's not. You'll learn which attractions you like and which you don't.\n\nAnd eventually...it will all start to feel heavy with familiarity. You'll feel like you know more than you don't. Most things you wonder about you'll also feel like you have an answer for.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is *it's not necessarily your home* that's causing this feeling. It's familiarity. It's knowledge. And those are both *wonderful* things in most situations.\n\nIt just so happens that they can also lead to feelings of being \"stuck.\"\n\nI don't have a lot of advice to share here, but what I've found helps is to always stay learning. Find things that you're interested in knowing about and find ways to learn about them that keep you engaged. Keep finding new areas to explore, and don't limit your search to destinations on the physical globe. Topics, fields, skills, books, etc -- just keep exploring.\n\nWith any luck, this way of approaching life will become a habit and you'll find that you don't necessarily need to be \"somewhere else\" in order to feel like you have something wide open in front of you.\n\nGood luck!",

And, like the top comment said (the one with the quote from Thoreau) it's good to learn to appreciate what is in your surroundings as though it were foreign, as though you don't know it.\n\nI moved abroad a few years ago after really enjoying travelling, and I now have that sense of familiarity with my new home. I love the place, but I don't get that feeling of excitement when I walk around it, like you do with a new city. That road leads to my work - *bad feelings* - that road leads to the tax office where I had to have a meeting once - *reminded of the boredom of doing that* - that road leads to the street with the really average bars which I've been to too many times to enjoy any more.\n\nIt's not that everywhere becomes boring, as such, just that unfamiliarity and the unknown is what's exciting and you can't live your life constantly chasing it. I've recently moved - temporarily - back to where I am originally from, and I've started paying attention to loads of wonderful things about my home, despite nothing really changing since I last lived here. I'm just trying to appreciate what is in my surroundings and find some good in everything.",

No past to contend with, only a future ahead of you filled with uncertainty and sheer adventure.\n\nThere tends to be that cliche that you do some \"soul-searching\" or find your \"true self\" when you travel. To some degree, that is true. You do develop a different personality overseas, especially when you become very open to the possibilities of anything. \n\nI've changed quite a bit when I traveled for about seven months by myself. At first, it was sheer anxiety from the very beginning: fears of miscommunication, mugging, kidnapping, getting drugged, etc. Mind you, my first leg of the trip was in South America, with which I was not familiar, and whose culture and customs were somewhat different from what I was used to. Additionally, I remember reading that South America had more crime relative to North America - I'm American btw.\n\nThroughout the weeks I was in the region, I became more acclimated. I became smarter with Spanish, customs, and navigating through cities. I would not trade for the world what I experienced however awkward and dangerous it was at times.\n\nReturning to the America was very sobering. I experienced so many things within seven months which would take years for an average American. It became difficult to relate to people and vice versa, and so I felt, ironically, out of place in a country that is home. That is why I tend to describe solo travel - especially for long periods - as a sort of Narnia syndrome: you go into a wardrobe for adventure only to return to people who can't really believe, much less care, what you experienced. Traveling feels like fantasy.",

I have a few thoughts! We know that one of the best ways to treat depression/low moods is through a treatment called behavioral activation. Essentially it\u2019s getting people to get up, get out, and engage in pleasurable activities thoroughly and consistently. However, for some people this doesn\u2019t seem to alleviate symptoms of depression because, they don\u2019t necessarily feel down, but will report chronic feelings of emptiness. We now know that an effective way to decrease feelings of emptiness is through seeking/experiencing novelty! Living abroad and/or traveling is the best way to be in contact with novel things constantly! So if you\u2019re someone who is struggling because the pandemic has made travel not an option, try to seek novelty in smaller accessible ways! Order takeout from a restaurant you\u2019ve never been to, order food you never normally would try, explore a part of town you\u2019ve never been to, strike up conversations strangers (people never expect this to increase our moods, as much as research shows it does!), try a new drink....go for it and do something out of your norm!

Personally, I reckon it's got something to do with being a stranger in a new place and being able to start fresh with a blank slate \u2014 even if it's only for a couple of weeks or so.\n\nBack home, you've people that know you and have grown to expect a certain pattern of behaviour when you're around. I think we all fall into the trap of trying to match those patterns \u2014 on a subconscious level.\n\nWhen you're abroad \u2014 heck, even if you're just in another city within your home country \u2014 the shackles of expectation tend to almost automatically slip away. You're freed up, mentally, to try being someone new. And reinventing ourselves feels great.\n\nAlso, I think there's something to be said about the fear of embarrassment. Most people are probably far more inhibited in their hometown settings.\n\nI know this sounds counterintuitive, but as well as making great memories with friends, we've all done something embarrassing that we'd rather not be reminded of \u2014 but pals like to bring those moments up now and again in the form of light ribbing.\n\nExample: you're out with mates and try striking up a conversation with another group, but you get blanked. Nothing major, but the chances are someone from your friendship group will remember that and bring it back up at some point in the future.\n\nWhen you're away, you can loosen up, without the worry of that happening.\n\nI'm no psychologist, but, hey, those are my thoughts.\n\n(By the way, I think similar things can be said about speaking your mind on sites like Reddit ;) )",

            "comment": "You're definitely not alone here. I feel the same way as you do, I am my best self when I'm not at 'home'. For me, it was interesting to realize a few years ago that this is true independently of where 'home' is, as I currently live abroad. I think it has to do with the life we live when we're at home: after graduating from university, most of us are forced to adapt to a fixed work routine to survive. This works for some people, but definitely not for everybody, and it has been the main reason why I can't get close to my work colleagues (or other people around here) at the few social events we attend together. I think the main reason is that most people become so full of responsibilities (kids/family/work/buying cars and houses/etc) that even things that were simple years ago now need to be scheduled weeks in advance and become, in a certain way, not really spontaneous. And when you travel, you meet people who are trying to avoid this life as well, so connections feel much more meaningful. Of course, this might depend on where you live, and this is my impression while living in a big business-oriented city. At some point, I had to simply accept that this life was not for me, and I started trying to figure out how I could have some alternative lifestyle, working remotely from somewhere. Usually, when I imagined how things could be if I could just stay 'on the road' I had some peace of mind. \n\nIf that was realistic or not, I still don't know cause corona came and I got stuck in the city I am currently living in. If this is not over in one year or so, I will get too old to get a WHV, and I will have to figure out another way to work while traveling. It sucks, really, but right now I don't see another alternative besides waiting it out and leaving when things start to go back to the way they were (and I believe this will take at least a year, depending on where you live, which makes me sad to think about). But if you think you'd abandon this life anyway, I don't see why you'd try to build something you don't want. \n\nAs a final comment, last weeks I started pretending that I'm 'traveling' at my own city, started to get rid of stuff I won't need anymore, do day trips and meet new people, same as I do when I'm away. Of course, corona makes this so much more difficult and it's definitely not the same, but somehow this already changed my mindset from 'being stuck at home' to \"I'm here only temporarily\". Maybe that could help as well? All the best!",

Culture, religion, *people* - they all feel so much more real and more suited for me. I'm in the wrong place, and I've discovered that right places do exist.\n\nWhen I'm abroad I love just walking everywhere, following that interesting road, looking what's behind the next corner, going into this unique store, trying that amazing street food stall. At home something prevents me from even doing something as simple as going out to eat on my own (which I have absolutely no problem with and really enjoy in other countries).\n\nThe only thing I've come up with is 'to move abroad', but even breaking that down into specific, achievable steps seems like an impossible task.

I'd always known I would be taking a 6+ month long trip after uni, so for the past 9 months I've been biding my time, living with my parents, saving every penny and not bothering to make friends or date, because what was the point? Next year I was planning on moving back to the city to start a master's program, so why bother setting up a life here if I had a plane ticket out and a 3 year plan that involved being elsewhere? \n\nI really felt like the past 2 years of my life Ive worked so hard at my stressful job and went through the worst heartbreak of my life and I spent that whole time not really living, just surviving. 2020 was supposed to be the year I chased my dreams and really lived. I don't know what I'm going to do, the thought of another year of this makes me cry everyday. I'm so upset that my life has been turned upside down again that I'm worried I'll waste another year being more miserable than I was before without something to look forward to.  Do we make an effort to start a temporary life? Because I know I will be abandoning it the first chance I get..",

No one else in my life understands how heartbreaking having these travel dreams shattered has been, but I expected more travellers to be talking about this. It's nice to hear that other people out there understand, although I wish neither of us had to go through this!\n\nI understand that for most, people complaining about travel plans being cancelled with everything else going on in the world seems silly. But people don't understand how much effort goes into planning and saving for long-term travel. All those times we sarifice short-term pleasures like skipping going to the movies with friends or wearing the same old clothes everyday so we could travel longer, we don't do it without reason. To choose to move abroad or invest savings into long-term travel isn't a decision people make lightly, so when that decision is taken away from us and is no longer something we have control over, of course it's going to be a difficult time.  This was years of planning, and was also going to continue to shape our lives for years to come. \n\nI really hope the \"glory days\" of travel aren't over, and I really hope we will cross paths out on the road someday in the future. All the best!",

It has a psychological angle to it.\nYou see, we live within the social boundaries setup by our societies which makes us judge about our actions whether they fit in or no.\nBut when we go to a completely new society unknown to our minds, we tend to feel the freedom to act without thinking about the consequences of being judged by others. \nFor eg, Simple things like smiling at strangers may be encouraged in some societies and thought of as silly in others. If you live in the latter but feel like smiling at everyone is liberating in some way, you might do that in a new place whether or not they encourage it. But in your own town you wouldn't because you know what people think and you think the same way. \n\nEven travelling with people you know from before can act as a point of judgement to your mind. So one stays within those mind-created limits. \n\nThen what is the solution to this? Keep moving? \nThat's what I personally have been doing somehow. \nLived in 5 cities in 2 countries, in the last 12 years. Every new city brings a profound change in my personality as I do newer things. I don't aim for a change but it naturally comes about at some point. \nPeople ask me where do I want to settle but I don't see a reason to settle, yet. And I don't impose any reason on myself. \n\nHowever now I have become a bit spiritual and have begun to shed any boundaries I notice in my mind, which were keeping me from living my life thw way I want, not the way society wants. \n\nTLDR You can be the same best self you become abroad still living where you are, by letting go your mind. We don't think when we're in a new place. We observe everything. Stop thinking where you are now.",

            "comment": "I can definitely understand this. I live abroad, so I guess it's the fact that I've been so far removed from the banalities of everyday life back home, it's hard to talk about anything of substance with people any more.\n\nI remember talking to one girl at a bar randomly the last time I was home, and when it hit that I lived in Asia in the conversation, it got awkward- since It dawned on me that the vast majority of Americans either can't afford to travel in that part of the world, or just don't really want to, and this girl was one of those people lol.\n\nLike compare that to when I was in the ME and the many, many new friends I made there, or the number I seem to make in SEA just at random events and festivals, it really is astonishing I'm barely competant with small talk back home unless someone else has been living the same way.",

A thousand times yes. \n\nI travelled alone in Amsterdam last year in December after going twice with friends and I thought I would feel quite lonely but it was fucking awesome. \n\nI smoked alone, ate alone, toured alone, shopped alone and got my first two tattoos alone and all of it was worth it. No distractions.\n\nI had time to think and time to just be myself with myself. No forced conversation, no mandatory checking up on people and no people arguing and debating about what they want to do and when.\n\nI did meet different people along the way but I just had the best time alone, people watching and just being happy.\n\nShit was the best and I miss it.\n\nFuck corona, I wanna go back.",

            "comment": "I felt like that for a very long time. I go on long backpacking trips and work/study abroad for 6months to a year at a time. I always feel so carefree overseas, so much energy every single day, super spontaneous, out going, and can go explore during the day and chat til bedtime without ever feeling exhausted about lack of alone time. Then when I'm home even though I have plenty of alone time in my room, I sometimes still feel too tired to go out to meet friends, and feel I don't quite fit in the city I grew up in. \n\nI think part of the reason for this is because I'm finding it harder to relate to close friends and family who don't understand why I love to travel so much. Everyone seems to think rather than Travel so much, I should be trying to settle down find a stable job.  \n\nTo mitigate those feelings I've tried joining travel groups on Facebook. Theres the Lonely Planet Travel group , and if you identify as female, there's also groups like Girls Love Travel. I've connected with a couple of people online from these groups and while it can't replace meeting up with people in person, it's been a nice supportive community for whenever I'm feeling down about being stuck at home. \n\n\nAnd another thing I've been trying to do is write down things I'm grateful for at the end of the day so rather than let the situation affect how I feel, I become happier about the small things here and there and feel less like I'm trapped in a hopeless situation. Hope that helps! Good luck!",

Had a student exchange in Spain from February to April (the virus outrage shortened my stay for a few months), which was essentially my first solo travel experience.\n\nAll the novelty in the locales, people, and things to do just fires up that spark that is routinely gone back home. There is something so endearing about all these unknowns that it is so hard to appreciate all these things back home with a full breath.\n\nNot that I hate home, but there is always a lingering feeling that I feel less constrained out on my own, which is probably true.",

You'll always have that sub-conscious feeling \" If I say something that might offend them, what will they think of me\". So you are more reserved around them. That doesn't happen with strangers. You can say your radical views out loud without fear of judgment, cause you are not gonna see them again.",

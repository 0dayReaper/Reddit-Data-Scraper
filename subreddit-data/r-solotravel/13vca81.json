    "postText": "I recently got back from a solo trip to Cairo. I booked it on a Wednesday before leaving Saturday so I didn't have a great amount of planning. Packing was easy and I had plenty of room in my Allpa 42. Business class on Air France's 787 was amazing.\n\nThere was a quick layover in Paris so I took the train to the Ile de Cite for a walk along the Seine and a lunch outside at a cafe. Touristy and not great food but would probably do something similar again unless I had a much longer layover.\n\nI arrived at the airport and bought my visa quickly in cash. Waited a longer time for customs, and stepped outside to grab an Uber. I was going to buy a local sim but my AT&amp;T service worked just fine and was only $10 a day. I would suggest getting a local some though as it is much cheaper. There was a kiosk in the airport like usual but the attendant seemed uninterested in helping me. The taxi drivers were pretty aggressive but were mostly okay with a \"no\" except one guy who followed me all the way to the Uber pickup area ( which is a bit difficult to find). I got in my Uber and an hour later I arrived in Giza (~$5)\n\nI had booked a room at the Mena House next to the pyramids. The staff was great and upgraded me to a nice suite with my Bonvoy status. The views of the pyramids were fantastic and the location was great for a quick start to a tour of the pyramids. I hired a guide for the pyramids, the Egyptian museum, and the Khan el-Khalili market. It made transportation effortless, kept the touts away, and was pretty inexpensive but he did take me to a couple of preferred shops in Giza that were a waste of time and would have been a waste of money had I bought anything at their inflated prices. If I did the trip again I would just go to those places again. There really isn't a need for a guide and Uber works very well and is extremely cheap.\n\nThat evening I realized that there is really no way to get off the campus of the walled hotel so I booked a food tour. It was inexpensive at $40 but again would have been just fine with an Uber if you knew where to go. The food was amazing, especially the falafel, but my guide was pretty distracted, didn't speak great English, and we didn't really click.\n\nThe next morning I was picked up by the van for a desert trip I had booked. I had an AMAZING time with a group of 5 other travellers from all over the world. We gelled as a group. While we were out in the desert they asked what hostel I was staying at. I replied I had been in a suite next to the pyramids but didn't love being penned in. They each invited me to their hostels in the Tahrir square area and I ended up staying at the Cecilia hotel with one of my travel buddies. Arriving was a shock to say the least as far as the nature of the accomodations but the people were great and I loved having people around to meet. \n\nI spent the next few days exploring the city with desert friend and solo and had a great. I have heard a lot of complaints about dealing with people in Cairo but I found them to be welcoming, warm, and fine with taking \"no\" and a look straight ahead as an answer.\n\nI saved upper Egypt and the Red Sea for another trip but I will definitely spend a while in Cairo again.",

Essentially you take a right as you leave the terminal and go to the small parking lot down the hill across the street from the cafe trailer. You won't really have too much trouble. The trip from the airport to Giza is about an hour but would only be 20-30 minutes if you are staying in downtown Cairo or Kamalek. \n\nI would just buy it at the airport  there is a vodaphone (I think) dealer right by the exit from the terminal. I went with a friend to purchase her sim a few days later at a shop on the street. It was like any western cell phone store and had a number of options. They tried to sell her more data than she really needed but all the options were quite reasonable. Google Fi also works over there and I have a separate sim for that, but a local sim is definitely your cheapest option.",

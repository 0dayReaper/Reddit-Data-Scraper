For some weird reason, I could not find any one stop connections from LPQ to DEL. My only options were either flying to Bangkok, doing a self-transfer which would've needed me to get a visa, and then flying to Delhi; OR fly domestic to Vientiane, do a self-transfer (no visa needed since I was already in Laos), and then take a through connection to Delhi via Bangkok. This also turned out to be cheaper since LPQ is a small airport with fewer and pricier flights, while VTE is a tad busier. I also did a LHR-ZRH-NBO-DAR many years ago with Swiss, but the NBO stop didn't need me to get out of the aircraft.",

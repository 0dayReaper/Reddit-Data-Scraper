    "postText": "My first time solo traveling. A 5-city itinerary. I was happier than never until I got to City 2 and visit a friend that I met playing online years ago. This friend offered going to City 3 together (it was a couple miles away) and also invited another friend of his, which also invited another friend. I mean, I went from a solo traveller to a group of four travellers on City 3 (me and three people that I met on City 2!)\n\nBro, I cannot tell how awesome this experience was. We got drunk, laughted a lot, visited some beaches, signed-up for random events, played videogames, so on and so forth...\n\nAnd then everyone had to go back to City 2 :(\n\nI still have two more days on City 3 before going to City 4. However, I'm feeling some sort of absence and bad vibes. Specially because I'm now lonely on the same hotel where we were having fun yesterday.\n\nI know I may go back to City 2 on a future vacation, However, it is on the opposite part of where I live in my country, so it was a hurtful farewell.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share that and see if anyone has had similar experience",

The crash you are feeling is normal - same thing often happens when you return home from a trip. When you try to extend or re-live those experiences, it's almost always disappointing, though. Just look back on what it was as a great memory, but focus on new and different experiences to get over it.",

You experienced something that many backpackers hope would happen, but never did during their trip. \n\nBittersweet isn't it? \n\nIt'll be a fond memory that is just a part of your overall experience! \n\nMaybe jot the entire experience in a journal in as much detail as you can while it's still fresh. When you grow older and flip to it, it'll bring a happy tear. \n\nMuch love to you!",

We just clicked. We were a family. And we all kept extending our trips +4 days here, +7 days there etc. Until we extended for 2 months to stay together and hang out. \n\nThose friendships are rare. We as travellers all yearn for it, or at least some part of us does. Somewhere in between living with non attachment yet wanting to share the experience with someone else. \n\nBut. We can\u2019t hold things tight. We must love from a distance. \n\nBlessings on your journey friend",

I got along with quite a few of them shockingly well, and had never laughed so much in my life. And then because of flight issues I decided to stay a little longer, by myself. I immediately broke down and cried hard in my hostel minutes after they left; it felt so devastating. What you are feeling is normal, I'd try to let yourself feel those feelings for a bit, and afterwards focus on being grateful that you had the opportunity to make those connections. Not everyone gets to experience that. Best of luck!",

It's the temporary nature of travel and fluid form of short-term relationships.\n\nYou should try to practise unattachment. Experience things for what they are in the moment, and let them be whatever they will be thereafter. I know that sounds quite flimsy, and you can always attempt to maintain contact, but seasoned solo travelers will tell you the same.",

We did all sorts of fun things together, visited Pompeii, went out at night in the Spanish quarter, and some of us even traveled onwards to Florence and Pisa together. But I have to say, after five days of burning the candle at both ends, I was soooo ready to be back on my own again. I went to Venice and even got a private hotel room rather than be in a hostel because I needed a break so bad. And I say this as a total social butterfly! So just know that it easily can go the other direction. You have to just be happy that it happened and stay in touch.",

It's more difficult for me because I'm 42 and most solo travelers are 22-26. I have struggled getting back into the groove of late because I've been staying in private rooms and it's hard to meet people in that sort of scenario. \n\nStay in some hostels and read the reviews first is my best advice. If it fits your vibe book it. I always suggest booking shorter stays and if you like it then extend. Never be afraid to move on sooner.",

But nowadays when I meet people I usually come to accept that this may be the only time we cross paths in our lifetimes, and it grounds me a ton!

    "postText": "Did it ever happen to you having lost someone very close and do a solotrip after a couple of weeks? If so how did it go? \n\nI lost my pet and had a 2 week solo trip booked in 5 weeks. If I cancel I'd lose flight money, probably not hostel and ferry money because I booked everything with cancelation option, but fine whatever. On one hand I have vacations booked and I can't imagine staying at home 2 weeks. On the other hand I get always a bit anxious before my trips, specially due to separation anxiety from my pets (I still have one dog) and since this grieving process is making me more anxious than normal I don't know how it would go. \n\nIn the past when I lost someone I prefered to be outside the house, but I had never lost someone I loved as much and everything is pointless, like food, everything. There's also the guilt and the feeling I don't deserve to do something nice, that's dishonoring her memory. \n\nI am medicated, seeked counselling, will probably approach this in the next session but I wanted to know the community experiences....because some things only solo people understand. \n\nSo how was that for you?",

            "comment": "I lost my grandmother last winter and had a trip booked 2 weeks after her passing. I thought about canceling, but ultimately decided to go. My grandma had always been so proud of my independence and love of travel. Every time we spoke she\u2019d ask me where I was going next. \n\nI dedicated my trip to the memory of my grandma. I made decisions during my vacation based on what I thought she\u2019d want for me. She always wanted to see her grandchildren happy, surrounded by love and friends. I was more social and adventurous during the trip in her honor. I think it was a great way to celebrate her life, spirit, and the virtues she tried to instill in us. And when I think back on the trip now, I do associate some of my memories with her life and her legacy. \n\nThere were absolutely some difficult moments during my vacation, but I look back and feel good about the decision I made, and I think she would have been proud. Whatever you decide, I wish you luck and love as you tackle your grief. If you decide to take your trip, I\u2019d recommend bringing a journal or some other preferred way to explore the high and low emotions of your trip. Best of luck.",

            "comment": "I got the news while on a solo trip about a decade ago that my last remaining grandparent had passed away suddenly in his sleep. We were very close. That was an awful day, largely spent trying to get a decent enough WiFi connection in Lithuania to contact my family and get travel arrangements made. (It was pre-smartphone).\n\nI immediately booked a last minute plane ticket home to go to the funeral and shiva with my family. Then I flew back and continued my trip. The first couple of days back on the road, I won't lie, sucked. Really sucked. But then I got back into the swing of things and it helped that a couple of friends came to join me for a few days on that leg of the trip. \n\nLater, I wound up getting some of the costs reimbursed by travel insurance (was covered under 3 policies, 2 of which didn't cover the death of a grandparent and 1 of which did). But even if I hadn't, it was worth it to be there with my family during those first days of grieving. I doubt I could've gone on with my travels otherwise.",

            "comment": "I lost a close friend of mine at the beginning of this year. I had tickets bought 4 days before he passed away. But I stayed because he was in the hospital. I ended up staying home for a couple months to grieve with my friends and make sure everyone is moving in the right direction before leaving for my extended backpacking trip.\n\nBut I'm in a mentally healthy state and have been most of my life. I've experienced loss before so it has made things easier to process again. I'm not a good person to ask for advice for emotionally charged things. But I can say grief is healthy and must be processed and accepted. Denying yourself grief is denying yourself healing. But at the same time, it's not healthy to hold onto grief. The point of grief is to accept and let go. I always remember that the people I lost probably don't want me grieving and feeling sad about them for the rest of my life. They'll want me to enjoy my life and move on, they'd want what's in my best interest as a friend or family member would.\n\nSo I'm enjoying my time traveling but I do miss my friends. I'm more worried about how everyone else is handling things than how I feel about my friends life. But I don't think most people are emotionally equipped to solo travel after an emotionally charged event, and I wouldn't recommend it.",

            "comment": "I had this exact situation happen last year. I lost my cat in May and had a trip to Peru planned for June. I also have a lot of anxiety surrounding leaving my cats when I go out of town. In this instance, I chose to have my remaining kitty stay at my parent's house instead of at my place with drop-in pet sitters. This alleviated a lot of my anxiety around leaving her. \n\nWhen it came down to it, I was glad I went ahead with my trip. It definitely helped me to be out and about doing things I love. Additionally, I was glad to have been able to be with my cat when he passed. I'd been so stressed because his health was declining, and I knew he didn't have much time left. I'd had this trip planned before he got his diagnosis, and I was terrified he'd die while I was out of the country.",

It would have been possible to go back but my parents called me at 7 pm saying she was unwell, at 8.45pm I was speaking with the vet about her staying in the clinic overnight while they performed some exams. I was waiting for the call with the results to buy the ticket back home next day in the morning to go pick her up (the trip back is around 5h because I have to get bus and then a train). But instead, at 9.30pm the vet was calling me saying she died. Even if I had bought the ticket to go during the night she would have died before I got home. She had been sick but it was an acute episode that I though she had recovered from, not a chronic disease.\n\n\nMy eldest pet was sick for a while. She was stable so I went in a one week vacation. I was in another country and as soon as my brother texted me I rushed back home and got next day. She died 10 min after I arrived. But at least I was somewhat prepared (she had been sick for a while, was old) and I was there. With this one, it was abrupt and she was young. It didn't matter I was in the same country, I still didn't make it to her.",

            "comment": "Hi, I\u2019ve never solo traveled before so I wouldn\u2019t be able to give personal experience feedback, but what about if you made the trip a little shorter? What do you think you could manage? Is there anything your dog loved/reminds you of them that you could bring with you as an anchor or token of safety? Making a pros and cons list about whether or not you should go could also be helpful.\n\nOne of my friends brothers unexpectedly passed away from a hiking accident late last year. She had a trip for London booked for a month from the date. She considered not going, but thought missing out on an experience she was excited for before the passing would leave her even more sad. She knew the trip wouldn\u2019t distract her from her grief, and she didn\u2019t want it to, but we thought she should do something nice for herself in such a tough time. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re dishonoring your pets memory by going on this solo travel. Considering what you can handle mentally and emotionally will inform your decision greatly. Be gentle with yourself, I believe that you\u2019ll choose what you think is best for you.\n\nSending love x",

I found out because my mother died of cancer and I was about to go through IVF (solo as well) and the ob/gyn said I should get a mammogram first. So was dealing with my diagnosis/rehashing my mothers cancer 5 years before/the possibility that I wouldn\u2019t be able to have children. \n\nI think about that trip sometimes and I feel like I drew a lot of strength from it. It was a time of quiet reflection with a strong undercurrent of fear and sorrow, but I feel like it helped me get through it all.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about the loss of your pet. I know how devastating that is, and I totally get that it would increase your separation anxiety. I hope whatever you decide feels right to you. You still have some time to decide and you might feel differently in a couple of weeks.",

I ended up going through with the trip (even electing to spend the holidays in Europe instead of going home and feeling his absence more profoundly; just wrote about this briefly here: https://www.dontfollowmetravel.com/blog/5-lessons-on-travel-planning-amp-preparation), and I think it actually helped me get some distance from the tragedy.\nFor me, travel can be a welcome distraction. I went through a pretty deep depression back in 2019, and the only times I felt relief were moments when I was traveling (specifically when I spent a week hiking in Austria, and another week I spent helping out on my friends' farm; nature is healing).\nBut I think the decision ultimately lies with you: you know yourself better than anyone, and you'll know what the right decision is.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been wanting to go to the Philippines for many years but couldn\u2019t because of COVID. It looks like I will finally be able to go this December since there are very few restrictions for vaccinated tourists. Just wanted to get thoughts on my possible itinerary.\n\nDays 1 and 2: Taal Volcano. Probably will stay at a resort there since it looks like there are no hostels in the area.\n\nDays 3-6: Boracay island. Looks pretty touristy but beautiful at the same time.\n\nDays 7-9: Coron. The town doesn\u2019t look that nice but I\u2019d love to have time to do some of those island hopping tours.\n\nDays 10-13: El Nido. I saw a really nice beachside hostel on Nacpan beach that looks incredibly beautiful and peaceful.\n\nOverall, I know I won\u2019t even be scratching the surface of the Philippines since I only have about two weeks of free time. I don\u2019t plan on going into Manila since everyone seems to say it is not worth it. I looked into going to Banaue but it looks really far from Manila and would require a 10 hour shuttle ride. \n\nFrom anyone whose been to the Philippines, do you think there is anything I am missing out on for a first timer? Any suggestions are appreciated.",

            "comment": "Filipino here. I would suggest just picking one between from Coron and El Nido (or still have both of them and reduce your stay in Boracay) and add Siargao to your list instead. You may get tired on doing continuous island hoppings with those 2 and the experience may be similar but I have to say that Coron and El Nido are undoubtly our best islands when it comes to the beach quality.\n\nIf you add Siargao, you\u2019ll have a very different experience from Boracay and Palawan as you have more freedom on the island and roaming with a motorbike. Just my recommendation. But it will be a bit hard for you to go there coming from Palawan as there are no direct flight unless you are coming from Manila or Cebu. \n\nBut yeah, skip Manila. It\u2019s not worth it especially that you only have 2 weeks.",

All joking aside, I do think that Intramoros, china town, the national history museum, and things like that do get overlooked by tourists but yes people should avoid Manila on their first visit if they don't have time",

I suspect I will try to visit both.\n\nSiargao looks nice too but it seems quite out of the way from Palawan. I was thinking maybe I would go there if I go on a second trip to the Philippines.",

Coron is famous for scuba diving and the wreck diving there is amazing, but coron IMO is only worth it for the diving. If you're not an experienced (advanced) diver, do el nido only or spend a lot more time in El Nido.",

Taal...we own a condo that overlooks the volcano, its for sure beautiful but the resort is meh.  The restaurants in the resort are a let down, so try the road side places, the current owners of the complex are trying to make a quick buck and because of that its understaffed at one point before most residents bitched the pool was green, the zoo is barely kept up and the animals are not getting the care they need and it goes downhill from there.  I might recommend you stay in one of the hotels or resorts along the highway and explore the town proper, you can still get a good view.\n\nBoracay is over rated and is ruined by tourism even by Philippine island standards its overcrowded, its nice, but you can see everything in a day, I would shorten your stay there by one day, i would suggest you check out Panglao Island, Bohol instead.  Coron and El Nido...Palwan is by far the most beautiful place in the world  and for your first PH visit I would max out your time there.  I am 40 and well past my hostel days but in the main jetty port in El Nido you should check out the happiness hostel, its by far my go to place for breakfast when we visit and I hear good things about the hostel",

Probably Escala resort in Tagaytay.\n\nBoracay does seem very touristy and crowded from what I've seen. The beaches there still look really nice and I think it would be a good place to meet other travelers and have nightlife. I don't know, I feel like it might be a fun place to spend some time. But hands down, I would absolutely spend a lot of time at Palawan.",

We did two boat tours and the whole place was just spectacular. \n\nBoracay was still good, but very touristy and I wouldn\u2019t bother going back. But I would go back to Coron no question and I also want to go to El Nido. \n\nCoron was just a quick flight from Manila too so really easy to get to. \n\nEveryone we met over there was so friendly, welcoming and helpful. You\u2019ll have a wonderful time!",

Tbh you\u2019re not really there for the \u201ctowns\u201d but all the natural sights you can see around the islands. The day boat tours are a must do. Palawan is hands down the most beautiful place I\u2019ve been too. \n\nI would skip boracay all together and go to siargao instead because it\u2019s a totally different vibe. Another person suggest Panglao/bohol for a day. I spent one day there and regretted it. It was not enough time to do anything but I honestly wasn\u2019t upset that I missed out on what it had to offer anyways. After the travel there and back that time could\u2019ve been used better in another destination.",

It seems like Siargao is more of a surfer's place.",

So when you go beware of the beach rules because there\u2019s a lot (ie mo eating, smoking, playing music etc). Boracay is more of a sit on the beach and relax type of place and/or party. But you can easily have a chill time there as well if you\u2019re not into partying. Anytime I went to the beach in boracay I would walk all the way to the right where the beach is wider and there\u2019s less tourists. But also beware of your belongings when you go swimming. I heard about a couple girls at my hotel getting their things stolen at the beach when they were in the ocean",

Some lesser known destinations that I really enjoyed: Sahaflar Carsisi (book bazaar), Museum of Innocence, and Pierre Loti Hill. I also highly recommend taking the ferry over to the Asian side, and getting an Instanbulkart (I tried to use every form of public transit at least once, but I only managed to do ferry, metro, bus, tram, and cable car).\n\nAnd of course you have to visit all the main tourist sights. I really recommend Cheers Hostel \u2014 affordable, great location, friendly people, and an incredible free breakfast spread each morning.",

A women walked a ways into the famous and tourist popular Isklatal street in Istanbul, where she placed down a backpack and then ran down the street. Minutes later, the backpack exploded, killing several people, including a small child. Me and my mom were on the street when it happened. \n\nIt was our first day in Istanbul and had us pretty shook up. However, we stayed an additional two days after that and the trip was extremely pleasant. What surprised me the most was how quickly the city came back to life after the attack. For maybe one day there seemed to be no one in the streets, yet two days later it seemed everyone came back, almost as if the attack never happened.",

            "comment": "As the biggest city in Europe it's pretty intense. As people have said below, look out for scams and anticipate paying more than you'd expect in Sultanahmet and Taksim.\n\nDefinitely visit Kadik\u00f6y, ironically has more of a European feel even though it's on the Asian side. The Marmaray can get you there pretty quickly from the main tourist area. The ferries are pretty reliable too.\n\nAlso try and find a top rated bufe (buffet). Really cheap prices and great food. You'll end up brushing shoulders with the locals too.\n\nFunicular up to taksim is cool. Recommend taking taxis at night, they're not too expensive if you agree the price in advance.\n\nCarry passport or ID with you at all times. Police often stop and check tourists and it happened to me twice.\n\nThere's a shuttle bus which runs from both airports. Make sure you plan in advance where to find it in case you don't have data. Also grab some cash as soon as you exit arrivals. It can be chaos outside the airports with hundreds of people offering you a taxi. Also plan how you're going to get back to the airport.\n\nI left Istanbul and headed to Sofia, Bulgaria. You can take the night train but it's only bookable at the station in Sultanahmet, so book it as soon as you know when you want to go. The train itself actually leaves from a station outside of the city so you'll need to plan how you're getting there late at night. I tried to book the night train 3 days before and it was sold out. Ended up getting the night bus instead which was fine.\n\nI moved around a few hostels in the city and Cheers is by far the best. They have a hostel dog too.\n\nFinally, B\u00fcy\u00fck Valide Han was the highlight of my Istanbul trip. A small coffee shop in an art studio with a terrace that overlooks the whole city and Bosphorus. It's quite difficult to find but ask around and the locals will help :)",

Happened to me four times (never fell for it, though).\n\nA \"helpful\" guy almost took my credit card at an ATM, saying it was malfunctioning. If someone approaches you while you're withdrawing money assume they are scammers.\n\nI was nearly pickpocketed on a bus. Fortunately, I was with friends who fought off the pickpockets and got my stuff back.\n\nA \"friendly\" tout tried to lure me into a ripoff bar on Taksim. Avoid bars near Taxim square, especially if recommended by a tout.\n\nA random guy started talking to me on the street smoothly to the point where it didn't feel genuine. I don't know what he wanted but it's obvious he was a scammer, too.\n\nThe stray dogs are more or less docile during the day but they get territorial and aggressive during the night. They seem to have adopted a nocturnal lifestyle where they concede the day to humans while claiming the night. That's why you see so many of them lying on the ground sleeping during the day.\n\nAnd that all happened in a course of just a month. Stay alert.",

Such an amazing city.  Totally worth getting educated on the scams, and then going there and having a great time.\n\nConsider doing a side trip to Ephesus, which is also amazing (better than Pompei)\n\nTurkish airlines is a discount airline with Istanbul as a hub.  You may be able to travel through Istanbul as part of another trip to Europe, e.g. if you have a work trip, you may be able to get a stopover in Istanbul for free.  Do it if you can.

I'm staying in Faith, walking distance to all the big tourist spots. The hotel does offer an airport charter but it's insanely expensive, should I just suck it up and do that rather than try and get an Uber at night my first time alone in a strange city?   \nAny suggestions for really great local restaurants in the area? I'll be walking everywhere the three days I'm there and I'd love to experience some proper local cuisine, not the fancy touristy stuff.   \nAlso, would it be best to book a day tour, or is it easy enough for a solo traveler to just walk everywhere and get in everywhere?   \nI'm female if that makes a difference to anything. But having grown up in South Africa I'm pretty used to always having my wits about me, so that's not really a worry for me.",

Nevertheless:\n\n* There's a huge amount to see and do, and it's a bit tricky to get around at times, so give yourself as much time as you can. I stayed for a week, and would have liked another couple of days.\n* Highlights included the Hagia Sophia (which was amazing), Topkapi Palace, 'Little Hagia Sophia', the city walls and a half day cruise up the Bosporus. The Galata to Taksim area was also really interesting.\n* I did an excellent day-long walking tour of the old Byzantine churches in the west of the old city through the company Istanbul Walks, which appears to still be operating. The tour went ahead despite me being the only person on it, and was led by a very knowledgeable local guide with a history degree. It was probably the best day tour I've ever done.\n* The city is great for photographers, with lots of interesting sites and street life.\n* I stayed in Sultanahmet, which was very convenient. All the restaurants in the area were terrible though (they all had touts and the ones I tried had lousy food), and I ended up going across to Galata or Taksim each night for dinner.\n* I stupidly didn't check prayer times ahead of visiting the mosques, and was (very politely) asked to leave some of them when prayers began. Don't do this.\n* The Grand Bazaar is an impressive building, but most of the shops in it were selling rubbish aimed at tourists. Hopefully this has since improved.\n* Lots of scammers hang out around the plaza between the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque - this included some of the awful people who try to trick you into going off to a bar with them where you'll be soaked for over-priced drinks. I learnt to walk quickly through this area, and ignored all the scammers calling out to me.",

Ride it out and shop if you want a rug. The big markets there have cute stuff and great deals. I treasure the rug I bought there.\n\nWe found staying on European side much more agreeable/normal and friendly to women.",

I pretty much covered all the touristy stuff in 2-1/2 days, and had so much more time to spend on the Asian side and other parts. really got to know the city better. It was also a hell lotta cheap. And since I was very close to the ferry station, I could easily hop-on, hop-off wherever and whenever I could. And sitting on ferry and absorbing the city was one of my favourite things to do.",

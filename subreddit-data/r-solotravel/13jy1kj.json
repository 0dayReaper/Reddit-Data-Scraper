I\u2019m in one of those in between exploring/travel days so I\u2019ll be on a bus until late at night. I like the feel of zero drop shoes but I lacked the foresight in accounting for the elements with them. I did some on the fly research and ordered a pair of Adidas Terrex.\n\nI\u2019m having a blast here but thought I\u2019d share my lesson learned for anyone on the fence about what kind of shoes to get/bring.",

The paper soaks up alot of the moisture overnight.\n\nAlternatively you could head to a shoe store and treat your shoes with water&amp;dirt repellant(if they offer that) Its not a perfect solution but might help a bit. I'm not talking about the obtainable sprays or sth, in my country shoe shops offer a heat-chemical treatment or something with a machine and it really helps from my experience. Not sure if thats available where you are though",

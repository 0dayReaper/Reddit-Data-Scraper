    "postText": "planning on backpacking thru guatemala and hitting all the major spots. the order i\u2019ve heard about them being done is:\n1 fly into guatemala city\n2 antigua\n3 lake atitlan\n4 semuc champey via 10 hour bus\n5 flores and tikal via 8 hour bus\n6 rio dulce v\u00eda 4 hour bus\n7 fly out of guatemala city\ni\u2019ve already done a lot of research on getting around between stops, especially for the long bus rides, but i\u2019ve only found information about them in this specific order, but i want to end my trip with the acatenango hike in antigua. would anyone happen to know if the buses run the opposite way as well? so the order would be reversed?",

Starting in Belize I plan on crossing into Guatemala to Tikal first and then making my way down to Flores then Semuc Champey, Lake Atitlan and finally to Antigua for the Acatenango Hike. I\u2019ve never been so you\u2019ll need a massive grain of salt but Rome2rio seems to be a good source for finding bus connections as well as potential hotels and such. I\u2019m honestly a bit worried about some of the longer legs but from what I\u2019ve seen online, everything is relatively simple and safe!",

Toughest part was the Belize border to Flores/tikal, plenty of taxis but no cheap public transport that I know of.  May be different nowadays though.",

The shuttles go to all of those places in pretty much either direction - maybe one or two would be tricky if there weren\u2019t enough people signed up but most will be doable.\n\nIf you want to save money and do it all with public transport, even that is possible, again going in either direction, it just takes a bit more planning and flexibility. Semuc is the most complicated to get to with public transport but even that\u2019s pretty doable with a connection in Coban - you just might have to spend a night somewhere along the way if the timing doesn\u2019t work out right.\n\nSo short answer is yes it\u2019s very possible to go in the order you asked - going to all of those places in any order would honestly be pretty straightforward unless you\u2019re really short on time. Could do a combination of shuttles and public transportation as well if you wanted.",

            "comment": "Just a quick note; the summit of Acatenango is well into the heights where altitude sickness is possible. All of the major tour companies that do that hike recommend staying in Antigua for at least two days prior to the hike, as the city sits at 5,069 feet (1,533 meters), and will allow you to adjust at least a little bit. For this reason, I'd recommend moving your Antigua plans to the end of the trip, or moving Acatenango to the end of the Antigua part of your trip.\n\nAlso, it's just better to be closer to the airport at the end of any trip. If you need to get to the airport from Semuc Champey for example, and you miss a shuttle, or your shuttle breaks down, it's going to be a lot harder to work out some sort of solution than if you're just the next city over from the airport.",

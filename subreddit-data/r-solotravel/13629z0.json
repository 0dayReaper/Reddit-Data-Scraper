    "postText": "24M. I'm visiting El Salvador in a few weeks. On Saturday I depart and land in Mexico City at 10PM, then the next morning at 11AM I depart again.\n\nI'm not sure if I should leave and explore the nightlife, grab a drink or two, then head back - or if I should just sleep in the capsule hotel and not risk it. I'm leaning towards the latter since I'm not sure if I'll get sleep on the plane ride in, and I'm not familiar with the city and how safe it is.\n\nAnyone have any advice?",

If you\u2019re into electronic music go on the resident advisor app, and find a show to pop into. I had a great time last time I was there at a few of the dance music clubs.",

But 10 hours of sleep is also great. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth- I felt safer in Roma Norte than in Chicago and Uber is very easy there. Mexico city is an absolute must. The food/drink scene there is incredible. If you haven\u2019t seen CDMX yet I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see it one day.",

People stay out late and Uber is always available, stay aware of your surroundings like you would in any major American city and you\u2019ll be fine.",

Or\u2026.Around the airport is not too much to see, take a didi to a famous tacos or bar doesnt matter the zone, dont bring visible expensive things with you and dont walk on empty dark streets and you will be fine.",

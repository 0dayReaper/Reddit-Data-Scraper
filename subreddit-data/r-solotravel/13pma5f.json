    "postText": "Hello fellow travelers! I just finished my second trip around Vietnam and since it seems to be one of the most often discussed destinations here I decided to share my personal experience that might help someone else.\n\nHere is my personal instruction how to do Ha Giang loop in a way that won't leave you disappointed.\n\n\u2022 First of all, just don't book the tour with big hostels like QT or Jasmine hostel. Book it with any smaller hostel in Hanoi.\n\n\u2022 Always ask about the maximum size of the group before you book the tour! I booked my tour through Central Backpackers hostel (they only sell QT and Jasmine tours). I picked QT because I had no idea how big these tour groups get so I wasn\u2019t too worried. Well, we were a group of 28 backpackers + around 20 easy drivers so almost 50 people in total with only one guide for the whole group!\n\n\u2022 If you have an international motorcycle license, you are a confident driver and you want to get the best experience, then don't book a tour at all, do the loop on your own!\n\n\u2022 If you don't have an international motorcycle license but you still want to get the best experience without doing a group tour, then take a bus to Ha Giang and hire an easy driver there. You can do it with the help of pretty much any hostel there. This way, it will be just you and your easy driver. You'll have to pay for their accommodation, food and of course for their service as a driver and guide, but this way you can control how many stops you make, where you stop and how long you spend at every viewpoint.\n\nDoing Ha Giang loop with a big group is miserable because breakfast and lunch takes forever and you waste the best part of the day sitting around and waiting for the group of 50-70 people to get food and eat. Also big groups can\u2019t stop at every nice viewpoint because some of them just don\u2019t have a parking space big enough for so many motorbikes and I can\u2019t describe the disappointment I felt when we were passing by so many amazing places and I could see that other groups with 5-7 bikes stoping there but we didn\u2019t. Besides that, the viewpoints where we did stop were not always the best. For example, our group skipped Guan Ba viewpoint on the first day of the loop and then we were supposed to pass by it on the last day of the loop, so I came to our tour guide and asked him if we were going to stop there this time. He said \u201cNo, we are not making any more stops before Ha Giang\u201d. I asked him why we couldn\u2019t stopped there if it\u2019s on the way anyway and he told me he actually didn\u2019t even know where this viewpoint was. Also, on the second day of the loop me and my friend were at the very end of the group with two easy drivers ahead of us, and they somehow lost the rest of the group and couldn\u2019t figure out where they went. My friend had to text some of the backpackers from our group to ask them to share their location, but even with the name of the viewpoint the easy drivers couldn\u2019t find the place and they had to ask locals for directions. \n\nSo basically what I\u2019m saying is that if you want to enjoy the breathtaking views of Ha Giang loop then do it with a small hostel or on your own. Big hostels don\u2019t care about your experience, they only care about their profits that\u2019s why they allow ridiculous groups of 30-40 bikes to drive with one guide, that\u2019s why they hire easy drivers that barely know the route, that\u2019s why they don\u2019t really care about your safety. Driving in a group of 30 bikes on steep mountain roads is NOT safe and not fun. I hope you make better choices than me and don\u2019t feel as frustrated after the tour as I felt.",

Some groups got really nice spots, while others got terrible ones. I think there were close to 200 people. That being said, each group was around 12 people, and I had the time of my life. I made really great friends, and all of the groups got together to party at the end of the night. Half my group were easy riders, and the drivers were always extremely vigilant of self drivers. Sometimes we would get separated from the main guide, but the easy riders would take care of us. By the 3rd night, half of the groups had left (3day instead of 4day tour), and the trip became even more manageable. We did complain about missing certain viewpoints, but by the end of the trip, we realized that we actually didn\u2019t miss out on much, or returned on the way back.",

At least in that case each group had their own guide, but each group stoped at the same viewpoints at the same time together, didn\u2019t they? At least we saw all of them passing by us with like 1-2 minutes intervals between the groups.\n\nPersonally, I just don\u2019t think that the point of Ha Giang loop is to party with 100 people in the evening. And I definitely don\u2019t want to be a part of group of 30 drivers who have been heavily drinking the night before. There is time and place for parties, like Halong bay booze cruise cause there is nothing else to do on the cruise ship anyway, or just Hanoi backpackers hostels. Like, don\u2019t get me wrong I love parties a lot! But I just don\u2019t think that a dangerous motorcycle tour where people fall and get injured every day is the one that should be advertised as a party tour.",

But normally it would be staggered, with two groups max at a time at each viewpoint. Yeah, I get what you\u2019re saying about the party thing. I found that it was nice to drink with the locals and easy riders, get to learn about their lives a bit. Plus, we always ate when we drank and had a strict 11/12 cutoff point depending on the homestay. 9 hours is definitely enough time to rest and sober up. For many of us, it was our first time on a semi-automatic bike, and only one person had ridden a bike before Asia, and we had no accidents or scratches. We always took it easy, and were mindful of our other group members.",

It all depends on if you do a 3, 4 or 5 days loop. I would recommend at least 4, 3 days felt way too rushed.\n\nI did a 4-day Thakhek loop in Laos and we always found a decent accommodation on the day of arrival in each village. I think when I do Ha Giang next time I\u2019ll do it this way, too.",

The second time it was a very narrow and very steep concrete road and because we were in a group of so many bikes I think we couldn\u2019t accelerate enough to make it to the top of the hill so my friend (he was driving both of us) kinda lost control of the bike and we flipped on the side. Both accidents left us with no injuries and scratches though because we were both wearing full protection. I only tore my pants a bit when we fell the second time but that was it.\n\nOn the bus from Ha Giang to Hanoi I met two girls who were also on one bike just like me and my friend, but they were wearing tiny shorts, crop tops and no protection when they fell, and man\u2026 these wounds looked BAD.\n\n\nPS: that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s very unsafe to do these tours in big groups.

Honestly I think it\u2019s so worth it! Such an amazing region with so many diverse landscapes. I\u2019d even spend a week there so that on some days we can do some little hikes here and there.",

I would much rather come back and do the whole loop after learning to ride solo, and even extend it beyond the loop and go along the Chinese border. Northern Vietnam is just beyond words",

I think it\u2019s completely random, and complete chaos in the morning before embarking. I think the loop will only become more and more popular (justifiably so), so I foresee issues with group sizes and lookout stops in the future \u2026On the IDP front - we saw police a few times -without license, I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable dealing with the police if not with a group.",

I still think that the best way is to do the tour with a private easy driver not with an organized tour company because as you said it\u2019s random with big hostels like QT and you can never know if it\u2019s gonna be a group of 12 or 30 motorbikes. Personally I wouldn\u2019t take the risk ending up with a big group like that again. A lot of my friends did it with small hostels who only sell their tours to the hostel guest so their groups are always small - 5-7 bikes. The thing about QT and Jasmine is that aside from selling it to their own guests they also sell it to people in party hostels in Hanoi\u2026 so it\u2019s always a bigger chance of ending up with a massive group if you book it with them.\n\nI\u2019m happy that your experience was better than mine! When did you do it?",

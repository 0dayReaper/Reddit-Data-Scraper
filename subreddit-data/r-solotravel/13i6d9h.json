    "postText": "Hey all, for those who have already traveled for a long period of time, I'm curious if you've noticed changes in how much you naturally connect with people, strike up conversations with strangers, and general changes in your level of introversion / extroversion?\n\nI did a solo trip by myself many years back, and I remember really easily making friends and connections. Fast forward to today, I'm just starting off on my second trip, after being focused on a solitary tech job for years. I'm noticing right away that I'm definitely out of practice, and it's harder to put myself out there than it used to be! I'm curious to hear other people's experiences with this.",

When I got there, I literally met a girl as I walked into the Hostel. I spent the rest of the evening with her and made more friends throughout the day. The next night I went to the casino, and a woman at the machines started chatting me up. My last day there, I went to get a tattoo and the guy and girl who owned the place ended up inviting me to a party that night. I ended up leaving with more friends than I made my 4 yrs in college. \n\nSomehow, I blossomed into a social butterfly. I also feel like other solo travelers are very like minded, so it's easy to make friends.",

I stayed at the social hostels and almost always found groups of people to do things with and made a bunch of friends. Now a decade later I find the solo aspect is the part that\u2019s gotten way easier. I\u2019m much more comfortable eating in restaurants alone, going to bars alone, exploring the city alone, etc.\n\nAt the same time making friends I\u2019ll never see again doesn\u2019t have the allure it used to. Occasionally I\u2019ll connect with someone but I don\u2019t seek it out anymore. And the whirlwind romances and travel flings definitely don\u2019t have any appeal anymore - I just can\u2019t do more heartache. At 22 it was easy to believe a guy when he told me that this experience was deep and meaningful and we would absolutely see each other again. At 32 I know that\u2019s a lie. Some of them just say whatever they think they need to to get laid, others sound genuine but come across as hopelessly naive.\n\nAt home I stopped fighting my inner introvert even sooner than I did when travelling. I think because I was comfortable at home I was comfortable being alone in that environment that much sooner. It took longer to get to that same place on the road because I was often nervous and felt like I needed help and support from others. Travelling for work was what finally made the transition - because I was in these places for a job I didn\u2019t feel the same pressure to maximize every experience and make memories.",

Plus the confidence of knowing that if I was rejected when talking to strangers, I would never have to see them again anyway. \n\nAs someone that moved away from my hometown for university and struggled to make friends, and suffered from social anxiety that kept me confined to my dorm room most nights, I'm surprised that I had so much luck meeting people and striking up conversations with strangers. It wasn't always easy, but it wasn't nearly as hard as I thought. I was 26 when I went on my solo trip though, and I think the natural confidence from getting older and being forced to meet new people in jobs, university etc helped. Since the trip I'm even more confident socialising with others, because I just remind myself that if I can survive 5 months alone in foreign countries by myself, I can pretty much take on anything!",

Similar comments are frequently seen in discussions forums and threads reporting bad experiences with solo travel. \n\nBut what if you're fully aware of that escapism? In my case I'm not even sure it's escapism from problems per se, but moreso a general discontent and staleness invariably creeps into my life without the exoticism of other cultures that are far different than my own. This desire to \"escape\" persists even when I feel I'm actively in control of and working on any psychological or other life problems. I think I have a personality that frequently craves novelty and change, especially in terms of my environment. \n\nIs it necessarily a bad thing to escape? I guess I'm reaching out for opinions on this.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t buy that travel is escapism. \n\nI think it\u2019s a narrative invented by people who don\u2019t travel in order to feel better and convince themselves they\u2019re not missing out by staying home. And it has seeped into wider conversation because it benefits the capitalist society we live in. Why? Because a capitalist society doesn\u2019t like it when we\u2019re not working! \n\nIf you go away for 3 days to the countryside it\u2019s not escaping, it\u2019s a short break. If you go away for 2 and a half weeks to Spain it\u2019s not escaping, it\u2019s a Summer holiday. But if you go away for a month or two, that suddenly becomes talked about as escaping? Bullshit. Its only because society gives us a few weeks off per year from our jobs that it\u2019s normal to take these short 1-2 week holidays. When you go against the grain and do something different then people want to pull you down and make you think there\u2019s something wrong with you. It\u2019s the crabs in a bucket mentality. \n\nWith regards to people saying they were \u201cescaping from the problems in their lives\u201d, if someone was having a hard time their friends would tell them to chill out, switch off, go to a spa for the weekend, have a break, spend time at the beach, reset. Why? Because it\u2019s helpful to rest, have a change of scenery, have fun, get a new perspective, and come back refreshed. So if those vloggers do feel they travelled to not think about their problems for a while then good for them. It\u2019s a perfectly valid way to cope and deal with things. \n\nI could say well I\u2019m having a bit of a tough time now, I\u2019m going to travel, have some fun, and pick things back up with a clear head. Why on earth would that be a bad thing? Why is it frowned upon to make yourself happy? Why should we all be stuck in our suffering? It\u2019s all about the narrative and how you frame it in your own mind.\n\nOur lives are - in my opinion - for living to the full, creating memories, and having new experiences. \n\nWe\u2019re not meant to do the same things everyday like a robot. If someone lived on a remote island I doubt they\u2019d fish all day long, they wouldn\u2019t clock in at 9am and clock out at 5pm, 5 days a week. They\u2019d do what was necessary to secure food and take care of their family and the rest of the time they\u2019d relax and have fun and spend time with loved ones and jump in waterfalls and swim in the sea.\n\nSo don\u2019t worry about it OP. You\u2019re spot on. Keep travelling :):)",

Ideally you'd have a situation where you're content with your day-to-day \"normal\" life and travel as a way to further enrich it, but since \"normal\" life is influenced by things beyond most people's control, I don't think there's anything wrong at the individual level with wanting to take a break from it. Actually, breaking out or \"escaping\" from your normal routine can in some ways be a helpful way to see more clearly where you want to change your normal routine.",

Escapism is bad, you don't solves issues by running from them.

            "comment": "Ill give a wide answer solution to your question, then a specific one to your situation.\n\nHaving a couple weeks away from your problems, and giving you distance from them, can help you solve them better. Travel can be excellent at this, as long as you understand the issues and are working to solve them. Of course this can also ruin the trip a bit, but that's not the main point of the question.\n\nHaving a couple weeks away from an unfulfilling/unhappy life, and you're not sure what the issue is or are unwilling to figure it out. This would be a much worse form of escapism and, unless you figure out what the issue is on the trip, will come back to life and be unhappy again. This will tend to lead you to think of travel as this \"paradise\" away from your problems. \n\nHaving a couple weeks of vacation and you have no problems/are happy. You're just traveling to spice stuff up, have a good time, and then come back home. It's a hobby that you enjoy spending time and money on, because it enriches your life and/or makes you happy. Congratulations you've done well! \n\n\n\n\nAs for your specific situation, an outside voice only has so much value. A massive chunk of therapy's value is the ability to be able to break down how+why you feel certain ways, and then come up with ways to remedy things you have issues with. In theory, this can all be done within yourself (introspection), and is important to be able to do. \n\nA desire to \"escape\" so to speak is a very weird way to put it. Most people that crave travel, don't have a desire to escape, but an urge to explore, an urge to do new things, visit new places, would feel \"restless\" in everyday life. More often a desire to escape would be linked with disliking something specific about your current environment.\n\nBut maybe you worded it poorly, and your conclusion is you do crave novelty and change, is correct. I don't see travel fixing this issue, ideally the end goal would be having a job that lets you travel insanely frequently or just live in different countries. Is the novelty and change not capturable in a daily way? Where you can incorporate it into your normal life?\n\nIn your case, i think travel wouldn't be helpful, cause you'd presumably come back to your normal life, and feel the same way. Or you'd feel even worse, after experiencing all this new stuff, you come back to the same old boring life.",

I filled my week with castles, museums, zoo and local cuisine. It gave me some rest of my overwhelming sadness as I was super busy sightseeing at daytime and super tired at night. I had no time to be sad. After I came back home I had more energy to process my anger, grief and disappointment and I also booked a therapy session. It was much easier to deal with my problems after some rest. And now I had my beautiful travel memories between me and the dreadful event.

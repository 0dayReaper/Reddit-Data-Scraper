    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI'm planning a trip in July through Dec visiting South America. I'm starting late July in Colombia, but I've booked everything there and will leave after the Flower Festival, (around Aug. 8), then I'm going to Ecuador, Per\u00fa, Chile (maybe), Argentina, Brazil and want to spend the New Year's Eve in Europe, then I'm going back to my country.\n\n I want to visit the not-so-known-or-common-places in each country. I've been in Machupicchu, Quito, BA, etc. and the capital cities are not my main interest this time, although I could think again if there is something that I might have missed before.\n\nI love to hike, river more than beaches, forest more than jungles (I hate the heat), and sometimes a good party is not a bad thing.\n\nWhat can you recommend and how many time should I set for each country?\n\nWhat I've researched so far is:\n\n* Ecuador: Mangahurco, Mompiche, Salinas de Guaranda\r, Chordeleg, Ayampe, \n* Per\u00fa: Huayllay (Pasco), Laguna de Mor\u00f3n, Punta Lomitas, Punta Lomitas, Choqolaqa\n* Chile: Caleta C\u00f3ndor, Puyuhuapi\n* Argentina: Villa Pehuenia, Santa Cruz, Chubut, La Rioja, Termas del R\u00edo Jord\u00e1n, Bariloche\n* Brazil: Cabo Frio y Buzios, Morro de Sao Paulo, Chapada Diamantina, Termas do Gravatal, Itacar\u00e9, La Gruta del Lago Azul, Valle de la Luna\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't have to be everything listed there, it could be less (or more haha), but I want some recommendations if you are a local or have been in those places/countries or know more to add to the list \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Hey,  Brazilian here. It all depends on your taste. Chapada Diamantina is absolutely stunning. Very different from everywhere in South America. If you're a beach person I recommend the states of Pernambuco and Ceara\nLots of gorgeous and warm beaches.\nYou could easily spend weeks in these places. It depends on your pace.\nI've been to Argentina recently for the 5th time and visited the North region. Very different from the other parts of the country. Definitely recommend. We stayed in Salta, Punamarca, Cafayate and San Salvador de jujuy...\n\nWell, it's a huge portion of the continent. If you need any more help in these two places let me know",

Is not like I wasn't coming back again haha",

                            "comment": "If you're a slow travel I'd recommend to split between the state of Bahia (two weeks in Chapada Diamantina and Itacare region and maybe Morro de Sao Paulo) and another two weeks in Rio ( Buzios, Cabo Frio, Parati and the city of Rio de Janeiro).\nThis itinerary has a lot of beaches. If it's too much for you, I'd replace some of them by Jalap\u00e3o, which is a bit far from those places I mentioned, but definitely worth a visit.\nFeel free to ask more questions \ud83d\ude09",

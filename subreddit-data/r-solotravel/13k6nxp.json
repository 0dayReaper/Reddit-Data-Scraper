    "postText": "26F. American. I booked my trip back in January for May to go to London and Paris and I was so nervous. I was so scared to travel alone but once the day came to leave I felt nothing but excitement. I got to London and fell in love with very aspect. I didn\u2019t do any tours, I just walked and walked everywhere and it was lovely. My first night there I walked until 2 AM as I met a stranger and ended up walking with him for 2 hours at midnight. I lasted 2.5 days in London and then left to Paris via Eurostar. When I tell you I fell deeply in love with Paris. It\u2019s so beautiful and old. I just loved it. I was in Paris for 5 days and again I didn\u2019t do any tours just took an itinerary that I found on TikTok and did everything on there. I ended up going to a viral club in Paris one night and ended up meeting some amazing people who were also solo traveling. My time there was incredible. I never felt unsafe in either places even when I walked at 2-3 AM. If you are scared to travel alone I\u2019m here to tell you the amazing experience will trump the fear. I\u2019m back home as of last night and I seriously want to cry so much because I miss it so badly.  It\u2019s really strange because during my entire trip I never felt alone or lonely but as soon as I got home, this feeling of loneliness came over me and now I\u2019m just trying to get rid of it. They say traveling is an addiction and I really never understood that until now. I am looking to book another trip to Ireland or Germany idk, I just need to get out there again.",

If you want a suggestion, next trip you could go to Spain, where I'm from, specially some region in Andalusia, or to Portugal. Both nice places to go alone, full of good people, safe, and cheap.",

When the conversation will start, I will probably find my way there (or at least try to), but I couldn\u2019t get past the starting point. That was the only thing that I missed from my last solo travel\n\nFor a little background: I travelled solo only once, it was Italy. I stayed in hostel and I was hoping that here I will be able to meet some people, which unfortunately I didnt.\nActually I think that for the next time I will be not so strict with mine trip plan - I stayed in Bologna for 5 days, where in one day I visited Venice for the whole day, then in next day Florence, then Rome\u2026 so basically I was getting into my room very late and waking up pretty early so I didnt even had a chance to start some conversation with my roommates - so this is defienietly one of the part that I can improve",

Play pingpong. Etc.\n\nI know it's pretty vague but I'd say it boils down to being interesting and being interested in others, the latter being more important than the former.",

Think the best way for me was to do the hostel activities. Many there are in a similar situation to you, solo traveling or traveling with one other. More open to talking, meeting new people. The free walking tours are a nice place to get to know people too, as you're all in a group for a couple hours, going to the same places, etc. Do the group dinners, group bar events. That being said, it is a little harder to meet someone just randomly out of the blue on the streets. They could be busy, just on a lunch break, on their way to some other thing, not in the same holiday schedule as you're on. That takes extra extroverted skills lol. I do wish I had more guts to meet some locals like that. I'd say 90% of the people I met on my recent trip were directly from the hostels.",

But if you're open to traveling outside of the cities, my side excursions were my favorite parts of my trip there!\n\nI *very* highly recommend visiting Monet's house and gardens in Giverny.  You can take a train from the Saint Lazare station in Paris to Vernon/Giverny; it's a little under an hour.  From there, you can take a shuttle bus or do what I did - rent a bicycle across from the station and bike there, it's maybe 5-6 km. The bikes have baskets on the front so you can pack a picnic lunch. I believe there are also buses going straight there from Paris. Monet's gardens are just goregous.  I was back in Paris by the evening.",

We\u2019re so car-centered that it makes people who walk places the odd ones out, and we associate walking &amp; public transport with poverty instead of viable daily transportation. It\u2019s an entirely different setup there; since they don\u2019t have to have huge parking lots everywhere that space is densely buildings so you can access a lot of businesses on foot. You don\u2019t have to *plan* to rent a car in Europe and it\u2019s lovely.\n\nAnd with everyone walking, going from place to place is more interactive so you get a stronger sense of community. Cars insulate us from others. We\u2019re frequently in our cars alone. In walkable places, you aren\u2019t often walking on deserted streets. Can still get sketch ofc. But when you\u2019re solo, it\u2019s nice that there are many clusters of people who also just left the club or whatever and are walking home. There\u2019s a whole thing where it seems like they are not as interested in shooting each other either, but that\u2019s an even longer discussion.\n\nIreland is great but I\u2019ll suggest you combine a trip to Germany with one of its neighbors- Czech Republic, Netherlands, &amp; Belgium I\u2019ve been to and I traveled so cheaply btwn them via Flixbus. Train\u2019s also an option if you have money to trade for time.\n\nWelcome to the (solo)Travel Addict club! Happy every time someone else gets to discover the old world &amp; all the new perspectives it gives!",

I did London and Paris several years ago and paired it with a third city - Nice, France.  I absolutely loved all 3 places, each is different and vibrant and beautiful in their own way.  Save for a few areas of Paris, I never felt unsafe either.  I also love just walking and seeing where my feet will take me. \n\nI also highly recommend Spain/Portugal as a future trip for you.  Most people visit southern Spain, but I went north and went to Barcelona, San Sebastian (one of my favorite places ever) and Bilbao.  In Germany, Cologne is gorgeous!  I have family in that area, but I have yet to visit Berlin.\n\nThe addiction is real!  If only we had all the time and money to go wherever we want.",

    "postText": "For a bit of context, I\u2019m a 21M who has been travelling solo for the last 3 weeks. I initially went to Vietnam, where I spent 2 weeks which didn\u2019t feel like enough, probably because I didn\u2019t plan to do the south but the airline changed my flight 3 days without any notice and sent me to HCMC instead of Hanoi. Had a pretty good time overall in Vietnam and LOVED Hanoi, esp the Ha Long Bay cruise.\n\nAfter Vietnam, I was meant to fly from Hanoi to Kolkata with 12 hours in Bangkok. I didn\u2019t organise my visa in time however, and ended up spending a full week in Bangkok. After the great time I had in Hanoi, BKK just felt sort of ok. I think this was mainly down to the people I met/hostel I stayed in. Also started to come down with sickness the last couple of days in Bangkok, which is ongoing.\n\nThis morning I arrived in Kolkata, and am now sitting in the lobby of my hotel waiting for the check in time. Already there\u2019s so much about India that\u2019s different from the other places I\u2019ve been. Only 1 counter for currency exchange in the airport that I saw (felt like I saw them everywhere at other airports) and nowhere to purchase a SIM! Does anyone know how I\u2019m supposed to find a tourist SIM outside of the airport?\n\nWhile I understand that the first night/couple of days in a new place can be unsettling, esp when feeling under the weather, I feel the urge to go back to SEA and just travel round there more. But I feel like I\u2019ve committed to 4 weeks in India as my flight to Rome is booked from Mumbai on June 12. I feel like I\u2019ve arrived in India and received a big reality check. Has anyone else felt this way after arriving in a new country and how did you manage it?",

Other travellers I met who did the big cities first then Goa, said they wished they did the other way round.  \n\nConscious Kolkata is the other end of India, so this will be budget dependent.",

If you\u2019re into mountain then Himachal. If you\u2019re into deserts and forts then Rajasthan, if you\u2019re into beach vibes then Goa and if you wanna just drink beer and hang out then you can come here to Bangalore, weather is kinda nice here. From all of these places you\u2019ll be able to reach to Mumbai. \nDon\u2019t expect the comfort, except scammers, hooters and all kinds of crap. Keeping expectations low is the best way to be happy here. Anyways you picked the absolute worst time of the year, Kolkata weather in May is horrible",

And super lovely weather now, not too hot.\n\nRajasthan also stupendous - very colourful.  Pushkar is a good entry - small town, easy for foreign travellers, tons of nice guest houses &amp; funky cafes / restaurants that cater to foreign &amp; domestic tourists.  Will be a bit hot there now but yeah just siesta in midday.  \n\n**OP, India is tough at first, fr sure!**   If you can find some other travellers to buddy up with for the long-haul train trips - like, to Varanassi, to Delhi, to Manali (Himalayas) - back to Delhi &amp; train all the way to Mumbai!   If the tickets are all sold out, you can get \u2018tatkal\u2019 it\u2019s \u2018tourist quota\u2019.  Good luck!",

Stumbled into a clay market that was really cool... I'd stay there at least four days.\n\nOther places I would recommend are Varanasi, Orchha, Gangtok and Mumbai is great too... I'd recommend more but India is huge and you don't have enough time to hop around everywhere.\n\nOnly eat food that has a line of Indians waiting for it, regardless of what the place looks like.\n\nedit: Don't bitch out and go where all of the foreigners go (Goa).",

A lot of people prefer southern India because it\u2019s less intense. \n\nYou are certainly not the first foreigner to feel this way, and you will either sink or swim. It can be an overwhelming country even for locals. But if you stick it out you will be rewarded.\n\nI typically describe my time in India as being capable of being heaven or hell in the same day.

The weather will be gorgeous, the culture and people are extremely chill, more off the beaten track and the north east especially gives very SE Asia vibes.\n\nIt is safari season though, so if you want to see tigers - now is the time. I would recommend Tadoba in eastern Maharashtra, Bandhavgarh in MP or Ranthambore in Rajasthan. It will be punishingly hot though, so be careful. \n\nBest of luck!\n\nEdit: avoid Manipur, going through massive political violence right now.",

I was stuck in traffic for almost an hour near Agra fort and would have missed my train to Jaipur if I didn\u2019t get down with my luggage and walked all the way to the train station in that heat. Plus, I was recovering from diarrhoea. Road, sideways, it\u2019s all the same. People drive and ride their bikes all over the place. Delhi metro was always so crowded that I never took it after the first time. Honestly I only liked seeing Taj Mahal very early in the morning and parts of Red Fort in Delhi. Jaipur was much better. The palaces, markets and streets were fun to explore. Don\u2019t miss Amber Fort. \n\nMy struggle in India was that people are always trying to scam you. It\u2019s hard when you can\u2019t trust anyone. Everything is a struggle even getting a tuktuk to go from point A to point B. And what\u2019s up with people trying to take photos? It was fine in the beginning but it started to get real annoying that I told them that I\u2019ll charge 500 rupees before taking a photo and they would go away lol. I thought Indians are critical of white people due to the colonial past as per posts on Reddit but reality is different. \n\nAnyway, try to have fun. There are some places that you may like. I\u2019ve heard South India is much better comparatively. I do plan on doing Goa and parts of South India next year. I am determined to change my mind.",

After some days you get used to it but prepare that from time to time you are questioning your stay in India. Going out helps a lot, if you can rent a scooter (especially if you go to Goa) even if you don't have license (I did it like that, forgot mine to get before the travel), driving with the traffic can connect your inner with the surrounding and with the locals in a magical way. Also pick a hostel with international company, talking with non local people can help extremely lot with cultural shock.\nFor sim card I can recommend airtel, 1.5 or 2gb/day for 200inr/month (yes its this cheap..). You can get simcard almost at any mobile or grocery shop where they sell more things than food. You can just ask any random people on the street or in the hotel and they can assist you where to get it. You need to bring original passport with you for that, copy is not enough, prepare with that too once you go for it.\nOverall I can just say give it some time. After the first day in Mumbai outer suburb I wanted to leave to country then I went to Goa, it helped a lot. Also set goals for India since if you are out of Goa the country is a big polite wtf which requires some determination to stay in. The first time I missed the Himalayas but its also a good target to visit at least I was told. \nIf you don't feel the country and have the funds you always can detour to Bali and come back once you have your flight from Mumbai.",

I did tours a lot and met some really great people but my focus was seeing castles/temples/historical stuff so my days were very full. I did Delhi, Agra, &amp; Jaipur solo then my friend met me in Mumbai before we went back to Kolkata for Christmas. I really recommend going to Agra to see the Taj Mahal - I did a sunrise tour and it's absolutely magical. My friend organized a SIM for me so I can't provide any details on that. If you have any trouble using ATMs (my bank would not allow the transactions at them anywhere in India - very frustrating) you can always ask your hotel if you can pay them with your card to get cash - the exchange rate won't be as good but it works in a pinch. And this is so silly but one day in Kolkata I was feeling super homesick (and guilty about being gone for Christmas) they took me to the Acropolis Mall (https://acropolismall.in) to shop and eat at Chili's haha I'm not sure where you're from but if it's the US it was a familiar feeling to be in the mall. It was a really fun, silly afternoon that we all still talk about and tbh after we went there, I once again felt energized and happy to be out exploring new places. I also had a great time at Monkey Bar in Kolkata and there's an insane Sunday brunch at the JW Marriott there  - we ate for hours and there was still stuff I didn't get to try.",

            "comment": "Hi OP. Native here. Try to think of Goa first. Especially the southern side. It serves as the perfect jumping off point, especially if it\u2019s your first time in India. It will be hot, but it\u2019s a familiar tourist destination and the locals depend on tourist money. Not to mention that there are beaches everywhere. You might want to look at Vagator and Palolem. A week here can do you good and also allow you to immerse in the culture.\n\nDon\u2019t stay in Kolkata. Not because it\u2019s not nice or anything but because I feel that the best bits of the place are reserved for when you have had a little time to acclimatise. Dharamkot, a small hill station in the north, would be my next bet after Goa. Or if you wanna continue on the beach trajectory, you can also visit the Andaman islands, especially Havelock and Neil.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want more tips or just general suggestions on how to ease your way into India. My country might not be for everyone but it definitely grows on you. Anyway you choose to traverse it, I hope you have a fun time. Cheers.",

Despite everything that went wrong, I would still go back (but only with a tour group). Hop on GetYourGuide and Viator and look for a group day tour of something that interests you. India is a lot less overwhelming if you have someone, especially a local someone, with you. You have the added advantage of being a male as well",

When I mention how the holy cows are roaming the streets eating plastic bags because their owners aren't humane enough to care for them, but are religious enough to worship them, they don't see a problem. They're also becoming more nationalistic, which is a whole other conversation, but that usually reduces progress in any nation because they don't see the errors in their ways. \n\nEvery time I visit family in India, most conversations turn into \"our new malls/roads/restaurants/airports/cars/toilets are world-class, I bet you don't see anything like that in Australia\". People, atleast my middle class fanily members, are living in a bubble of self importance and have no desire to know what the world is like outside their sphere.

They are way cheaper than the garbage \"deals\" you're offered at the airport. There is a bit of a learning curve as far as installing them and making sure you get to the right network- it does require going into your phones network settings and altering some things. I'm not very tech savvy, and I had to ask for some help the first time, but I've gotten the hang of them now and I'm not turning back. You can basically go 1 GB at a time as you need and usually for just a few bucks USD. You will need WiFi access to install them and get them going.\n\nThe app I'm using is Airalo. It provides pretty good/clear instructions for how to install them, I'm just a bit of a neanderthal when it comes to this stuff.\n\nGood luck! You'll be fine.

Spoke to some locals about it who were all on a different network which is apparently only available to Indian residents but it seemed to work perfectly. After a couple weeks doing the golden triangle and a couple other nearby places I made my way south and spent a week in Goa which was fantastic and much more similar to other backpacker places I'd been in Asia.

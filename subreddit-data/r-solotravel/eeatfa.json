    "postText": "I see so many people on here on how solo travel changed their depressive lifestyle or social anxiety problems. I don't think these people are wrong by any means. I have personally experienced these awesome leaps with my social anxiety while travelling solo. But I also feel the need to show the other side of the coin a bit. Because I feel people with serious mental health problems should tread carefully. This can be an extremely isolating experience, especially if you haven't exercised yourself socially in a while. Friends do not just come out of nowhere with a bottle of rum. I hear people say you can't isolate yourself in hostels cause you are surrounded by people all the time. WRONG. You can absolutely isolate yourself. In fact I think a lot more people find hostels isolating more than they'd like to admit. Hoards of new people coming every week make those efforts to find deep connections with others worthless. Plus It's all surface level interactions. But hey, if you're looking to party for a week with a bunch of random strangers then go right ahead. But this can be extremely jarring for a person looking to put themselves out in the world after say years of social isolation.\n\nYou still have to put yourself out there when you travel. And solo travel can give many a great opportunity to do that. But some are just not ready for that big of a leap. They need professional help and small steps in the right direction. Not a bungee jump into the things they fear the most.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

In my experience this allowed a grace period in which I could engage the world without (or at least lessened) the filters of hesitance, doubt, or even fear.  It felt amazing and proved to be hugely helpful in my personal progression towards a healthier mental state.  In hindsight I've realized it was effectively a self guided sort of exposure therapy.",

Also, OP have you tried therapy / CBT?\n\nPersonally,  I dealt with severe social anxiety for years. I read all of the books,  tried meds, herbal supplements and none of it did much of anything. What finally helped was daily meditation and online therapy.\n\nMeditation can help you to get in a better head space over time. There are tons of  free meditation videos / soundtracks on youtube. I feel like it's  helped me to feel better and more clear headed. Plus, it doesn't cost  anything.\n\nWhat really made the difference for me was when I started [online therapy](http://depressionarchive.com/Social_Anxiety) for social anxiety. You only deal with licensed therapists, you get  counseling at home on your schedule, your info is kept private, you can  switch therapists at any time and it's much cheaper than traditional in  person treatment. It's pretty much turned my life around. Hope this can help someone out there.",

I don't like small talk just as much as the next introvert but traveling solo to a place where none of the toxic people back home existed was very liberating. Don't get me wrong. People can still be a hit or miss but the difference is that you don't give a damn. You're not going to see these people again, so why bother yourself? Enjoy yourself as much as possible and indulge. These surface-level interactions are actually the small doses of socializations that I needed in order to bring my confidence in other people back. It's a stark reminder that the whole world does not revolve around the toxic people back home. That even though it's ephemeral, these short-bursts of interactions are more meaningful than the ones you interact with for the rest of the year.",

Occasionally you might be pushed out of your comfort zone and experience change, but if you do everything you can to remain in it, it's quite easy to do so.\n\nAnother thing worth saying is that when your trip is so miserable that you feel like going home because you can't talk to anyone or you burn out or you are overwhelmed or anxious or depressed as a result of what you're experiencing... Pay attention. If you came here to work on yourself, being uncomfortable is the way through, not the barrier. If you go home the minute you become uncomfortable then you weren't ready to be on this trip or change yourself in the first place. With that said, we learn while uncomfortable, but we rarely learn while we're in panic. Take care of yourself and forgive yourself and take a step back when you need to.\n\nI'm an experiential educator and I've lead group international travel trips build to challenge people into learning and growth. I know from my own experience and that of my participants that travel *can* change your life. But it's not a passive action.",

I didn\u2019t realize how much of an adjustment it would really be. I\u2019m not much a partier, so the only social interaction I would have is with people in my room. I felt very isolated very quickly and the only thing that cured my debilitating anxiety because of the isolation/extreme change in lifestyle is forcing myself to talk to strangers in queues or asking for recommendations/directions from strangers when exploring a city. What solo travel really taught me was COPING SKILLS. No one was there to offer advice or be a shoulder to cry on while I was experiencing extreme anxiety. I acquired a lot of resilience. And although it didn\u2019t cure any anxiety, I learned how to better cope with it on my own.",

Having loads of fun with someone you just met, and then when you/they leave, you never see or talk to them again. It's a bummer, but for someone that is emotionally vulnerable, I can see it being much more hurtful for them. And then having to return back to their normal lives back home, where none of the fun stuff will follow you back essentially. That could make a mental problem worse, in my opinion.",

While yes, traveling solo won't solve or cure social anxiety or depression, it does highlight specific manageable pieces that lead to social anxiety by being a jarring experience. For a lot of newcomers to travel, and specifically those with social anxiety, their experience at home is routine and limiting. Typically they have the same interactions, know they can expect the same things from the same people, and their ability to take steps forward to \"break out\" as it were, is limited by the continuous feeling that everyone around them is already intrenched in something that they aren't a part of. \n\nTraveling offers the opportunity for a rotating lazy susan of firsts and a roulette wheel of different people that wouldn't otherwise isn't available to people. Depending on the severity ,or the particular anxiety inducing aspect of social interaction, there are more points of entry to make efforts to move forward or beyond a level of anxiety by being able to stay removed as long as is necessary and entering social circumstances when one is willing to take the plunge even if it's just to dip a toe with a compatriot that happens to be in the same space.\n\nI don't think anyone that is turning to travel genuinely thinks that they will cure themselves, nor is a treatment replacement, but even you highlighted the point that you have made personal leaps with dealing with (different than treating) your social anxiety, and that isn't an opportunity you should scare others off from pursuing.",

I learned to deal with the bad days in my day to day life and it\u2019s really helped me keep perspective when travelling. \n\nMy uncle was a world traveller and I really emulated him growing up. But little did I know he suffered from bipolar disorder and later Schizophrenia, which developed after years of him ignoring medical advice and trying to find himself in Buddhism. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Buddhism helped him but he constantly stopped taking his medication and eventually he couldn\u2019t maintain things. In his early 40s he had been committed three times and was still trying to plan his next adventure to the Philippines. Then he had another episode and committed suicide. \n\nI think travelling was great for my uncle. He always came back renewed. But then time would pass and he had never learned how to keep a routine or a stable lifestyle that would allow him to take care of his mental illness. He saw travelling and living abroad as a fix but it was really just a way to avoid getting real help.",

            "comment": "I just recently came back from a trip, and was actually going to make a similar post.\n\nAfter having some time to reflect, I think that the main effect of going solo traveling is the jarring change of environment. You rip yourself out of your daily routine for X weeks and this does have a strong effect \u2013 but there is still one constant variable, yourself. I think if a person's depression/anxiety/other issues are primarily made worse through their environment (e.g. toxic family or coworkers), their mental health will go up on the trip. However, if the problems are more internal, then the travel will not do much, or, even make it worse (because travel is stressful, and solo travel puts an extra level pressure on those with social issues or, say, hypervigilance). So instead of an immediate relief, their symptoms might get worse or they might have a full breakdown.\n\nI would say travel is a valuable experience for anyone, but it's not a magic bullet - it will pull you out of the mundane, but you are still going on the trip with yourself and will have to account for that. I spent three days anxious with intermittent crying because a member of the hostel staff low-key accused me of not doing the dishes in That Voice that invariably sends me into a breakdown on a bad day. Your mental health absolutely goes on the trip with you.\n\n I think these kind of circumstances are great for learning more about yourself and stretching beyond your comfort zone, but 'learning' doesn't always feel great and can still be just as overwhelming as it is back home.",

One would usually tread carefully with their friends, especially ones they would usually work together or see each other fairly often. On the other hand, there is little to no consequence if you don't develop a friendship with others in the hostel - the chances you would encounter each other in the rest of your life is virtually zero. With little social cost compared to your usual neighbourhood, there is little to worry about too, and therefore is a great opportunity to step out of your comfort zone.",

Also have been working through mental health issues, both before travel and now. Even with someone with you, travel may give a reprieve, but when symtoms hit, they can hit hard. \n\nIf you are considering travel, please have a long conversation with a doctor. As not all medications are allowed to travel. Some countries have 30 day supply limits starting from the day you enter. If your trip spans multiple countries you may need to aquire new medications mid trip. Your countries embassy may be able to help determine what medication is allowed where. \n\nHaving a strong support system has helped me. I use whatsapp or another message app to stay connected to friends and family in group chats. Not really something I did back home, but I can keep up with the day to day. If something stupid happens, for example your hostel is between 2 bars that play bass heavy dance music until 2 am. And you are exhausted and all you want is to sleep. You can tell someone about it. \nAlso good for days when things are going great and you want  to share.",

The issue is, I make more money than anyone I know and have more vacation days. Traveling is my passion and has almost become an addiction. I don\u2019t mind traveling by myself I always meet people that I end up becoming social media  friends for life with. It\u2019s very interesting to learn how life is in other countries. But it can be very, very, very lonely at times. My job is so stressful I get irritated by people so easily I\u2019m starting to isolate more and more. I went to Vegas with my friend a few months ago. She told me to never, ever, travel with anyone again at this point in my life. I am praying when I get back home I can strengthen my current relationships and meet more friends",

When you put yourself in situations where if nothing else you go on a group tour with other people who don't know each other or you go stay in a hostel and maybe work up the nerve to ask people to go have a beer...its the rip the band-aid off moment, so that when you come back you have the since that you can be more social",

            "comment": "Definitely have to be comfortable enough to put yourself out there for solo travel to feel empowering, IMO.  \n\nI met a girl at my hostel in Prague (I\u2019m currently in Vienna) and we spent the whole day going on walking tours together, got dinner, and then walked  around the old town Christmas market\u2014it was great and I think having such a quick connection with her and some great tour guides, I was devastated to leave Prague so soon.  \n\nHowever, I was burned out after walking around for 13 hours on Saturday, and then I spent Sunday morning walking around Prague alone, and the afternoon sitting alone on a train for 4 hours and when I got to my hostel the public area was packed and noisy and people were clearly having a great time and idk... Trying to insert myself into that social situation felt too daunting/exhausting, so I walked around the city a bit by myself, got take away dinner, and then went back to my hostel to do laundry and sleep. \n\nToday, I started off feeling the same kind of social exhaustion, so decided not to go on the walking tour I\u2019d planned to do (that it was pouring rain was also a motivator) and I ended up spending 6 hours wandering a museum and the surrounding city. Felt very lonely and that contributed to feeling insecure and kinda anti social.\n\nI made it back to the hostel and forced myself to have a cappuccino in the main public area, even if I was sitting in a corner on my own.  I was about to get up and head back to my room to ?? maybe watch some Netflix (and feel shitty about it bc I\u2019m on a vacation why waste time on Netflix), maybe text the friend I made in Prague\u2014but then a guy told the room that he was going to a Christmas market if anyone wanted to come and the two other people there said no, and I said yes.\n\nSo, I got to spend a few hours walking around and being social and actually do something\u2014it was also a confidence booster.  The guy later said it had taken him a while to work up the courage to ask if anyone wanted to come with him, too.",

Especially if you end up overextending yourself or faced with even more lonlieness you're used to. The feeling of \"same shit, different place\" can be liberating and mind clearing to some, but it can also worsen it for others. That's my two cents.",

            "comment": "I just went on a seven day solo cruise to Hawaii last month. Though I stayed in a solo \u201cstateroom\u201d(actually  a glorified closet) on the ship, and not in a hostel, in which things could get hostile, on land. \n\nAfter months of preparation and fear that I might miss the boat or the plane, etc., none of these serious fears were realized. The most serious snafus were land excursions not delivering promised meals, and with occasionally \u201cnot getting that perfect video because I hit the \u201csleep/wake\u201d button (not so likely if you hold the smart phone in \u201cportrait\u201d orientation, instead of \u201clandscape\u201d orientation) or because I put it on \u201cphoto\u201d mode instead of \u201cvideo\u201d mode. But those are far more preferable than the aforementioned ones that I was afraid of. I say this and especially in light of the fact that my sister was in Spain 10 years ago, with not having gotten a single photo out of it because of some mistake she made with her camera, a mistake that she did not discover until she got back.\n\nIn any case, both my regular doctor and my neurologist recommended that I go on the cruise, even if I stayed on board the ship all the time. I seldom go on vacation. The last two times I went on vacation were also solo trips back in 2001 and 2008. The rest of the time I\u2019m pretty much home alone a lot. So I figure this cruise was an object exercise in helping to \u201cre-train my brain\u201d in late middle age. With all the memories, photos and videos that I got from it, I figure it was worth it.\n\nOne bit of advice so, if you go on a helicopter tour, take your own photos and videos, rather than buying their commercial copies of your particular flight. Reason: you\u2019ll probably have to download software in order to view your flight on the flashdrive, which will prove undoable. And if you email them or try to call them(even repeatedly, even within the 30 day limit), you\u2019ll find that to be undoable as well. This was my experience with Blue Hawaiian Helicopter Tours. Fortunately, the helicopter tour itself went well. And I did take my own photos and videos.",

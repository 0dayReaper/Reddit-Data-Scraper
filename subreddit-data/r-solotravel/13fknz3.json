    "postText": "Last year I travelled for 14 days to the UK, and I'm going again this year. I remember it was scary then, and I was quite upset about going away alone for a long time, but I ended up loving it and didn't even want to leave.\n\nNow I've planned a trip again, and it'll be 16 days. Thing is, my mental state is a bit worse than it was then, and it can be quite unpredictable. I've a lot less inspiration about things to do, and I feel less up for it. I know I will enjoy it when I'm there, but maybe 16 days is a bit too long? I'm thinking of going 10 days instead. Thing is that even tomorrow my mood might already improve, and I might regret cutting it short. \n\nI was wondering if anyone here has had the same experience and can help me out\n\nTLDR: What's worse; having more time than I can handle or having not enough time?\n\nEdit: also, have you found travelling for a longer period of time is better because you have more time to get used to the solo travel-mood?",

As always, a reminder that for people struggling with mental health, solo travel is not a substitute for professional help--and that the stress of travel (unfamiliar surroundings/languages, culture shock, lack of a support network) can sometimes exacerbate these issues. If you are experiencing a genuine mental health crisis, please reach out to your nearest crisis centre/counselor/hotline. Meanwhile, we have an [excellent post about solo travel and mental health](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/mentalhealth) in our Wiki that you might find worth reading.",

I thought I\u2019d planned enough rest days, but I was wrong and that\u2019s ok. Just acknowledge how you\u2019re feeling and don\u2019t get too far ahead in your planning if you can manage that.

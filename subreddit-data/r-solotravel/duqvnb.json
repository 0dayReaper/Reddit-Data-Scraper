    "postText": "I know, scams and assholes are everywhere and even in my country (Italy) tourists and even italians sometimes get scammed a lot in bigger cities by some pieces of shit, but let me tell you, **Marrakech was in a different league**.\n\nI'm not a newbie traveller, usually i know which places and situations to avoid, how to protect myself from pickpocketing and i generally don't trust anyone at first sight while travelling but in just 72 hours of Marrakech:\n\n* I've seen **sexual harassment** twice towards tourist women\n* They tried to **pickpocketing** me once even if i'm 2 meters tall (6.5 feet) and my bag was locked with a lock\n* Every 2 meters there was somebody **harassing me** somehow, i had no problem with shop owners inviting me in their shop but some of them were pretty agressive and approached me really close that i've felt really uncomfortable even as a man\n* While you walk around Medina there is always somebody yelling at you *\"you are in the wrong road, follow me\"* or *\"there is no exit here, go there\"* and **they are always lying**, the worst are the ones who follows you and they keep telling you what to do and if you don't ignore them (as i did) they will ask you to pay them.\n* I wanted to drink a fresh orange juice in a local spot and the price for a cup was 4dh, the OJ wasn't even fresh and the shop owner asked me for 10dh, i said *\"no it's 4dh there\"* and he said *\"yeah but this is a big cup not small\"* and guess what? There was only one size of cups available, the big one\\*.\\*I paid without complaining just because i was alone and i didn't want to start a discussion with some arabs just for 1 euro, but it sucked.\n* **You can't\\\\it's really hard to take pictures**, i knew that the snake charmers and artists in the main square are like those fake idiots gladiators in Rome and they let you take pictures of them at first and then they ask you for money but i wasn't ready to be yelled at just for taking a wide picture of a street or a blank wall.I know they don't like getting photographed because of religion and culture but i didn't and still i got yelled at!\n* **You can't trust anyone** and after a while you start to become paranoid about it.While i was shopping in a store a young worker there asked me if i was italian and when i said yes he started to talk in a perfect italian and told me his story, where he lived in italy and how grateful he was with us because with his job in italy now he can own a store there in Marrakech, his story touched me at first and i was happy for him.Before leaving he said to me *\"don't follow the road here because there is a dangerous neighborhood ahead, go back, turn right and go on and you will reach a small square where there is a special festival today for the holy day (Friday)\"*, as i said before i don't trust anyone while travelling but this time was different and you know what?There was no festival, the dangerous neighborhood was a normal one and on the way one of his friends tried to stopped me saying that i had to follow him because the road was closed and he knew the way out.\n\nAnd there are so many examples that i could tell you but this would become a boring and long post.\n\nAll of this happened in just 72 hours and after i while i got sick of this beautiful city and i spent my last evening there in the riad watching Netflix because i was tired of all of this.\n\nI actually had some nice encounters with locals, there was a small breakfast place close to my riad and the owner was really friendly and honest and even invited me to try some things for free and also the owner of the riad helped me to find a place where to print my boarding pass at 10pm, but other than that all of this experiences ruined my experience there.\n\nI loved Marrakech as a city and i think it's worth a visit but i won't come back again alone or with somebody else because of this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**It's sad to see such a nice place ruined by so many assholes.**",

Even if you ask for permission to take picture of something like a stack of olives or mounds of spices laid out without no human being in the photo, people asked for money.\n\nEDIT: if you guys haven\u2019t seen a show called scam city on Netflix, it\u2019s worth seeing once. There is an episode on Marrakech. And per the show, the reason why they take you to specific shops on tours is because if you buy something there the tour guide goes back to the shop and collects his commission later on. It\u2019s all about the \u201ccut\u201d.",

I did end up spending money on a beautiful cobalt blue leather jacket that's one of a kind but didn't have the money for anything else. So when we got to the last shop the owner saw I wasn't buying anything, grabbed me by the wrist (I am a woman and really didn't like this), pointed to his tongue and said \"Honey I want to taste your money, buy something.\" It was disgusting and as awful as it sounds I never want to go back to Morocco because of this and other similar experiences I had on that trip.",

I've experienced it in Vietnam, Nepal, Peru..\n\nI generally stay away from organized tours for that reason..  but sometimes I just don't mind.  In Peru I had ankle problems and my friend stomach problems, after a long hike..  we booked a relaxing day trip up to some lakes, visiting some villages along the way.  There was some obvious \"and now for the shops where you can buy stuff part of the tour\" type stuff, but I looked around and they seemed to be local Quechua women just trying to make some money.  I didn't mind contributing to the local economy at all, and in that particular case at least, there was no pressure to buy anything (well, maybe a bit).  I bought a great alpaca scarf for my mom and something else I can't remember.  There's always some sort of story about what the village is and what they're doing, and you have to always take it in with a bit of grain of sand..  Is it embellished?  Maybe in this case, maybe not.  In the end I didn't mind contributing to the local economy at all, and the product was great and a bit overpriced, but for my western wallet it was cheap nevertheless\n\nUsually I'll look around at the bs they're selling.  It's usually overrpriced so I almost never buy anything.  But occasionally I do, when a small..  very small girl came up to me in Peru one time..  selling these toques (hats)..  Very cheap.  She couldn't have been older than 6?  7?  5?  I have noidea, but she looked so poor.  Right away I understood that she was sent out to sell these, because she'll probably sell more due to the..  well sympathy/empathy factor.  I paid her double for the hat.  They were really cheap.  I also bought some postcards from her and gave her a tip.  For me it was all really really cheap.  She probably took the money back to her boss or parents or whatever, but honestly, I don't mind contributing to the local economy in that case.  The hat was handmade from what I could tell and I still have it to this day.  Maybe the money went to her family.  Or her mom's boss.  Or some sketchy dude.  I have no idea but it made me feel good to do that\n\nSo it depends.  Usually I just ignore stupid trinkets and bullshit at these markets you're taken to.  But sometimes you see something cool you want, and sometimes you just don't mind helping out.",

I haggled them down to 50% of the originally stated cost and they even threw in a tie.  I know I overpaid and was probably technically ripped off a bit, but I love my suit, and they had the tailor visit my hotel 2 times to do adjustments, and then deliver on my last day in the country.  The fabrics seem legit and I love how it fits on me and looks and all that.  I haven't gotten it checked out by a tailor, but I believe if I bought something similar here at home, I would pay a lot more.\n\nOther than that, I'm with you, I only buy small things that fit in my bag.  I would love to buy cool large masks and vases and all that stuff, but I have no room for it in my bag.  I know you can ship that stuff home, but that's hassle, extra cost, and I hate shopping to begin with actually. When I'm travel I'm there to do all sorts of things, and shopping isn't really one of them",

Not only in India, but in any developing country. I did this is Beijing. Got a tshirt and baseball cap for 20 yuan (like 3 usd) . \n\nYou gotta remain firm on your price.

It's not just 'foreign'-looking tourists that are targeted, but Indians as well. \n\nGenerally speaking, every taxi / tuk tuk (we call them 'auto' here) in India is on the payroll of some or the other hotel. That's always a given, and frankly not too wrong in the larger scheme of things. But more often than not they take you where you tell them to and will only take you to *their* hotel if you specifically ask them to take you to *a* hotel. You happened to hire somebody who is definitely an exception IMO. \n\nI hope that you had at least some positive experiences to take back home with you!  :)",

Taxi couldn\u2019t go into the old city so I had to grab my bag and walk. I\u2019m a 22f and got completely swarmed by men trying to talk to me and yell things at me. At one point I was just standing there freaking out because I was surrounded by people until finally a guy on a motorcycle came and helped me to my hostel. I was with some guy friends (thank god) for the 4 days but we were constantly lied to and taken advantage of. It was a sigh of relief to get back to the airport and finally relax.",

Looked around in a few shops there and I never felt pressured into buying anything and most of the time the owners didn\u2019t talk to me except saying hi when I entered.\n\n\nBut everyone saying that you\u2019re walking the wrong direction everywhere you go did get tiresome and I\u2019m happy we didn\u2019t spend too much time there.",

They are after easy targets, after fresh meat who doesn't know any better.  If you pretend you've been there for a while or before or for whatever reason know all their tricks (even if you don't), they will eventually probably move on to what they perceive to be an easier target.\n\nWhen I arrive in some new foreign place I've never been to, I sort of spend my first couple days peoplewatching.  I need a day to de-jetlag usually, so my first day in the country is usually rather casual.  I go to cafes, restaurants, I visit parks, sit on benches, and just relax.  I watch how people move and interact, how they cross the street, how people order food, how they eat, and just..  watch people move.    I learn about local ideas about personal space and other such things.\n\nI find that this helps me \"move more like a local\" later on in my trip.  I usually travel solo, which makes me a target, so I want to appear as though I'm not an easy target.  And the more you appear as though you've been there for a while, or are familiar with the culture, the more they will think that you're onto their scams and know what they're up to.\n\nHonestly, just plain straight up completely ignoring people has been very effective for me.  But it depends on which culture you're dealing with.",

I was frustrated to see him escape. Cops laughed when I made a police report. The hard part was that I was a resident of Rabat at the time and he got away with my California drivers license, so I had to apply for, and get a Moroccan drivers license. That meant I had to take officially sanctioned driving lessons and take a \"practical\" driving test. What a pain! I also had to pay off cops who stopped me while I had no license until mine came in. Artful thieves maybe, but not violent as far as my experience shows.",

My first experience with this was a guy just suddenly walking beside me, explaining random stuff to me.  I told him several times I don't want a guide, and he kept following me.  He got REALLY upset when I wouldn't pay him later, so I felt bad and gave him enough for a beer.  That made him even madder and he said his boss would be mad at him and that I need to pay him a lot more.  I said that's not my problem and kept walking.  It was a rather empty temple, so I was a bit sketched out.  Does he have accomplices?  Will people follow me?  Should I get tf out of there?  If you'er not familiar with the temples in the area, a lot of them are basically in the jungle.    There's random boulders of stone, walkways, overgrown with bush, etc. and it's easy to wander around by yourself and sometimes not see another person for a while, at some of the temples.  This was one of them where there was almost nobody else there, there was a lot of treecover, and it sort of looked like a scene out of Indiana Jones or whatever.  I did not feel great to be there by myself, after that just happened.\n\nFortunately I was able to in peace continue exploring that particular temple and did not run into this person again.  But this sort of thing happened to me again.\n\nUnfortunately the only way I've figured out to avoid this is to be VERY insistent on not needing a guide.  You have to be *RUDE*.    I am not a rude person generally, so this was not easy for me, but in the end I had to embrace it.  Be rude, ignore, and tell them to get tf away from you if needed.  Don't yell, but you gotta stand your ground.  And be safe",

By this point I was ready to go home, so I paid the price. My post cards never showed up and this was a 5* hotel.\n\nOtherwise, the shopping, markets and food were amazing.

If you want to visit Morocco, go to coastal cities in the North, mountainous areas and small villages in the South East. Avoid Marrakech or go there for one day or two, the same for Casablanca and Fez. Cities like Al-Huceima, Tetouan, Chefchaon, Rabat, Asfi, Mogador, Rachidia, Ouarzazate, Zagora, etc are fine.\n\nAlso another general advice. If you are a solo traveler try to be inconspicuous. You will not be a magnet that attracts every douchebag. Dress similar to the locals. Don't wear flashy clothes and accessories and try to look like you know the place and not clueless. If someone threatens you, let the police know... etc.",

Being tall, not-Arab-looking, and obviously a tourist can make you feel really ostracized in Morocco really quickly because of how much harassment there can be. Like you said, it can get really overwhelming. Sadly it\u2019s even worse for women.\n\nMy first time in Morocco, I had a particularly bad time in Casablanca, fes, and Marrakech and did the same thing as you where I just had to shut myself away from Morocco. Now, I\u2019m settled in Rabat, and I love it here.\n\nStill, I think you should give it another go. Cities like ifrane, chefchaouen, essaouira, Rabat, and some other slower-paced cities are a super fun time and you\u2019ll find a lot of good people and things to do there. I\u2019ve absolutely loved my time here and all of the Moroccans that I\u2019ve met. I\u2019ve had some bad days here, but the good experiences and people outweigh the bad times I\u2019ve had here. I think you\u2019ll have a similar experience if you branch off of the common path and avoid the more touristy cities.",

When I was in Morocco in May, I planned to be in Marrakech for 4 days and  turned into 2.5 because of all the harassment, which turned into not trusting others intentions. So I left a day early to go on the 3d2n desert tour, which was a big highlight of the trip. \n\nAlso, I went during Ramadan and was questioned 3 times at restaurants about ordering alcohol. I'm from the States, mixed black and white, so I blended in and was mistaken for being from there/Muslim. It was super stressful the first time, the manager came over, talking about how there is police  and the laws of drinking. \n\nMy advise, spend more time in Chefchaouen, Rabat, Essaouira for sure ! And take the desert tour!",

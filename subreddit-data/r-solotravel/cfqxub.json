To me, having an \"authentic\" experience doesn't mean living like a local or never seeing another tourist. I know I'm a tourist myself. However, it does mean that sometimes I don't want to arrive somewhere, go to my Western hotel by overpriced taxi, eat in chain restaurants fully focused on tourists, then go to a temple and exit through a gift shop, and go to clubs with only other tourists.\n\nIt's fine to want something that's less commercial and more \"authentic\". You can have that experience anywhere in the world, even in tourist hotspots. It just turns out that it's more difficult to avoid that mass tourism in some places than in others.",

There's a debatable issue where what's \"authentic\" to you is a community that has no other choice and would gladly live a different lifestyle if it was an option. There's also the growing dilemma of people who want an \"authentic\" experience but without irony expect Western-style amenities, leading to a weird situation where places reliant on tourism feed to you an \"authentic\" experience that is just fake in a different way.\n\nDon't ask me where the line is: It's something I struggle with myself. I don't feel bad for choosing the hotel over the homestay or even seeing the tacky display, but I also try to get out of my comfort zone as much as I can.",

I generally try to avoid meat when eating out so I've had plenty of McDonald's fish sandwiches. In France the fish and the tartar sauce have more flavor, there's way less grease, no cheese, and the sandwich small enough I can actually finish it.",

Go to the 13th or 14th arrondissment in Paris. Takes 15 mins on a subway. Tourists don't go there.\n\nGo to Buda instead of Pest. Go a bit north of the palace. You're in a locals area with nary a tourist in sight for most of the day, though you're essentially just across a river from the hot spots.\n\nHell, even in Venice, walk in Dorsoduro. That big lumpy part to the west of the Rialto? Super quiet and full of interesting sights.\n\nTiny towns often are one of two things: utterly boring because nothing happens there, or overtouristed but without enough space to disperse their tourists so you feel even more claustrophic.",

It's seeing the country as a local sees it and not simply the tourist destinations.\n\nIt's understanding the actual culture and not the parts marketed towards my interests as an outsider. I was lucky enough to be invited to special events and gatherings in the homes of locals, who delighted in telling me more about The history of their people, their culture, their values.... \n\nOP is definitely hitting at a point here. There are plenty of travelers who are obnoxious and think dragging their unkempt assess around Thailand with the dreadlocks and elephant pants is somehow the path to nirvana, but there is also a valid point to be made for seeking out the places and food a person living there would actually visit, and being able to experience the real customs and not the \"shows\" put on to appeal to an outside audience.",

Great local restaurants, traditional cuisine cooked the right way (which a tourist probably wouldn\u2019t be able to recognise), walks to go on and sights to see. I feel like most tourists in the area probably don\u2019t get the \u2018authentic\u2019 experience but there is one and they would enjoy it. I live in northern England so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re a developing nation but globalisation is pushing out traditional culture. If I was someone\u2019s travel guide I\u2019d be able to give them an authentic experience and show them how to live like a local which they probably wouldn\u2019t be able to do otherwise. I don\u2019t really see what\u2019s wrong with that being the aim of tourists elsewhere as long as they\u2019re sensitive about the way they go about looking for it. When I went to a Barcelona recently I could have eaten at chain restaurants or even and the touristy places that pander to tastes of Americans but I don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with putting in the work to find some places mainly filed with locals and getting an \u201cauthentic\u201d experience. Sure, the locals go to macdonalds. But they also go to places I can\u2019t visit back home. \n\nEdit: actually I did go to mcdonalds in Barcelona. They had stuff on the menu that they didn\u2019t back home so I wanted to try it. I\u2019m all for living like a local on holiday even if it is a bit wanky middle class",

Amazing trip, amazing country, but I didn\u2019t do enough research when going to Lake Atitlan and ended up in some hippy town that was almost entirely \u2018spiritual\u2019 Aussies and Americans. I get that I\u2019ll never live as a Guatemalan in Guatemala, but fuck me if I went to Guatemala to hang out with wannabe Instagram celebrities instagramming their self-guided spiritual awakening/yoga retreat.  All of the food was geared towards healthy eating westerners (and was way too expensive for the average locals to eat), and the local population lived in a distinctly different part of town.  I have an almost identical story about traveling in El Salvador. \n\nFor me, it\u2019s less about having an \u2018authentic\u2019 experience, and more about having an experience that doesn\u2019t wall me off from the local population and puts me in a situation where I exclusively have access to roughly the same shit I have back home, but with slightly different scenery. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being a tourist, but I think when many of us say they want an authentic experience it\u2019s less about pretending we\u2019re a local, and more about spending time with and around locals that aren\u2019t there exclusively to serve us at a price that is discounted compared to back home.",

Is the tourist who spends three days in the k-hole at Berghain having a more \"authentic\" Berlin experience than I am, a human who lives here and works here? I've never been to Berghain, but I did get a letter from the city saying I underpaid my taxes by 2.70 euros and could I transfer them that amount of money ASAP. Is that an authentic Berlin experience?\n\nMaybe, maybe not. They're certainly very different experiences. If the tourist wants to truly get a feel for a place, they're going to need to move there for a good long time, but most people don't have the time, money, immigration opportunities, or the mental/emotional pain tolerance for that. But they want to feel like they experienced a place anyway, and that's okay. They did, in their way. And that's fine.\n\nWhat I take issue with is people who think it's not an \"authentic\" experience unless it's free. Sometimes the travel stars align and amazing things happen for free, but tourists, especially in developing countries, should keep their relative wealth and privilege in mind. A thing can still be \"authentic\" when money changes hands for it. Delicious food is still delicious when you pay for it vs. when someone makes it for you.",

You have ups and downs. You share your day with your \"authentic\" co-workers. You learn what it's like to get up, commute, work, socialize, and eat like a local. \n\nWhen you travel for a holiday, it's a wholly different experience, regardless of where you go. You have this insulated feeling and you feel kinda thrilled about everything because you are not working. You see people doing their jobs, and you think about how charming it is that they are doing their thing. How cute! Let me take a photo. \n\nI've only worked at one overseas location (Japan).  I also traveled there for a few weeks and the difference between working and playing was vast.",

Otherwise, you are just a tourist and you should do all the touristy things and have a good time! (the exception to this being food, where avoiding all the touristy food places and only trying local spots is totally okay)",

            "comment": "Let me present an alternate, yet related question: how much does the tourism itself in a given place influence the way the local people actually live their lives? And to what extent is this good or bad?\n\nFor example, I was in Hanoi about a month ago, and if you go to the old town, it's not really possible to have that type of \"authentic experience\" because almost all of the locals there are involved in the tourism industry in one way or another. Whether selling tours, souvenirs, clothing, food or coffee, their livelihoods have been indisputably impacted by the fact that their town is constantly overrun with tourists. To me, this makes for a not-so-ideal traveling experience, because, as a white male, I tend to get the  rich foreigner treatment wherein locals assume that I have tons of money to spend frivolously on everything (I don't; I'm a student). But we can't blame the locals themselves for this. We can, however, blame those foreigners who do spend indiscriminately and allow the locals to take advantage of them. It's a self propagating cycle: ignorance -&gt; greed -&gt; earnings -&gt; more tourism -&gt; more ignorance -&gt; more greed... and so on. And in my opinion, with greed comes a general downward spiral in the integrity of a place: I wouldn't want to go to Hanoi again anytime soon.  \n\nThe question of the OP is a simple one but the answer is very complicated. There are factors going both ways, and as with anything in life, it's not black and white (neither foreigners nor locals are entirely the problem). The deeper issue is an issue of human nature and how to live a life that's fulfilling to you. Usually, people can make do with much less than they have, but greed often goes unchecked and that's where most of the world's corruption and conflict stem from. \n\nSorry for getting all philosophical on y'all but that's just the way I tend to think.",

I have always thought b was the more 'authentic' option, but fuck that.\n\nActually, there's an option c, which is to go to McDonald's. That's what the locals do.\n\nI just find something really disingenuous about finding the 'real' [insert place]. And when people say 'I love spending time with the locals and learning the history and culture' - honestly, what is that? Do these people *really* sit and listen to stories about the place they're visiting, while in a local's house in a little village somewhere?\n\nI've had plenty of interactions with local residents of places big and small, and to be honest they've never been especially enlightening. They were fine, I mean no disrespect. But why pay hundreds of euros to travel across the world to have a mundane interaction with an authentic local?",

There are plenty of stuff to do only expats actually do. Sometimes locals don't even know about those awesome parties, bars or events.\nTo me, what makes a trip really special and authentic is that you can explore it your own way, and that includes absorving some local culture as well.\nI think a short trip to a foreign country is not enough. People usually go to the most touristic places, and that is fine and interesting too. \nBut living there, creating your new lifestyle is exciting!! \ud83d\ude0d And you have to adapt to their culture anyway (for example, in Madrid I used to order groceries on Amazon and in prague I had to go to an actual supermarket (they gave Tesco that delivers home but that website doesn't offer a great experience for a foreigner).",

Yeah, it'll be a lot like the leisure activities you do back home.  But in different places, they do the same activities in slightly different ways, with a slightly different flavor.  At Taiwanese baseball games, the crowd has a song and dance they do for each home batter.  In Brooklyn, you'll find people playing quidditch at the public park.  In Shanghai, you'll find groups of old men playing cards.  In Bulgaria, you'll find hordes of teenagers at the ice rink, skating at insane speeds as you try to dodge them.

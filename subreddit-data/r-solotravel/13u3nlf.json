    "postText": "Travelling around Europe for the first time and bought the 2 month 15 travel day pass after asking others who have previously travelled around, doing what I thought was extensive research online, making a very detailed travel itinerary, etc etc etc. I\u2019m finding the websites a bit difficult to navigate and after buying the pass last week to start buying my seat reservations (trip is July - September) I\u2019m finding myself extremely frustrated with the website. \n\nNeeding to get from Vienna to Split, Split to Budapest and Sofia to Istanbul but it looks like all the seat reservations are already booked out. Feel like I\u2019ve wasted so much money on this pass and wishing I just booked buses and planes! \n\nDoes anyone have any better alternatives for the overnight trains? Everyone who\u2019s done a Europe trip before me made it sound super easy and like you can book last minute even in the summer months but I don\u2019t think that is the case anymore",

Some are needed, some are not.  \n\n\nIf you want to get on the Sofia-Istanbul sleeper you need to buy a ticket at the station, or get someone to do it for you, I've done this with Discover by Rail, as per the details on Seat61's page and it works fine, I arranged it a couple of weeks before by email and the ticket was delivered to my hostel a couple of days before I was due to travel.   \nhttps://www.seat61.com/trains-and-routes/bucharest-and-sofia-to-istanbul-by-train.htm",

            "comment": "What i've found is ppl over simplify their responses online to make their vacation sound better than reality, too lazy to include important details that would change someone's decision or fail to mention their vacation was pre-covid.\n\nThe season and what train schedule you're willing to jump on makes a big difference and 'tis the season of 'revenge travel' yet again....most ppl are blowing their vacation funds that have been 'held up' cuz covid.\n\nI'm traveling during shoulder season and some flixbuses in sept/october (the direct ones that are not overnight and have more desireable timetables) are already sold out or only have 3 seats left.\n\nFrom my observation, shoulder season is going to be busier than every previous shoulder season pre-covid. If anybody gives advice about scheduling transpo/accomodation last minute, ask them if their advice comes from pre-covid times. That has now become a deciding factor.....things have changed.",

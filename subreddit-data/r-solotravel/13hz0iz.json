    "postText": "mid-20s M here... I was due to spend around 10 days in Italy. I booked all of it months in advance albeit while super sick and bedridden for a few days. \n\nWhile on the bus to the airport I had a bit of a breakdown and wondered why I was going at all... then got to the airport and had two more because I just couldn't face trying to navigate multiple cities alone for that long. \n\nWhat's sort of contributed to my decision to cancel is that every time I've travelled since Covid the vibe has felt super different. I did two solo trips pre-covid but only for 4 nights at a time, and all my group trips were 5-7 nights... but since covid when I've gone off to do some solo stuff away from my group I've just found people to also be super reclusive/prefer to stick to their own 'kind'...\n\nAnyone else here struggling with that last bit? Feels kinda sad that I've not been able to form the kinds of connections I was pre-Covid even though I'm staying in hostels. It kinda feels like I'm only ever gonna be able to do short solo trips now, and even then my own anxiety is getting in the way and/or other people just aren't as interested in accepting non-extroverted solos into their social space...",

I've just been to New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand and Japan before this and it's been the same in all of them, ppl mixing matching going out for adventures. The ppl that are traveling are back to normal. Sure there's some mask wearing and ppl are probably a little cleaner than before but that's not exactly a bad thing lol",

The issue isn\u2019t other people after covid, it\u2019s your own approach. \n\nAlso I don\u2019t think the point in solo travel should be to find other people, it should be to enjoy your time exploring by yourself.

When I was about 20 I did a cross country road trip for a few months and I had an anxiety attack in the first few days because the immense uncertainty of it all terrified me. I pushed through though and completed it. Felt amazing after for having understood my anxiety rather than give into it. \n\nHaving traveled extensively before Covid and ventured out after, I think at this point most things are back to normal. This probably coincidental. It can just be hard sometimes to make connections. But if you commit to the trip you usually will somehow. And if you don\u2019t, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have a good time.\n\nIt sounds like there is a deeper issue here. Best of luck.",

I've travelled several times subsequently domestically and internationally for work and holidays, and am much more comfortable with things.",

Swimming pool, open bar, beer pong. It\u2019s more expensive than pre-covid but its there. And everyone is going right now. Find a hostel with a pubcrawl. When people get drunk they get friendly. \n\nAnd also: you\u2019re not the only solo traveler? Find another one and link with them. And I mean LINK. \n\nIf you see another solo traveler standing there looking around nervous, you can walk right up to them and say \u201cHey, what\u2019s up?!\u201d\n\nEven better if you can find two or three. Bomb. Group. Hell, half of you may check out tomorrow but you have best friends for the night, other solo travelers scared shitless. \n\nAll you have to get over is your anxiety.

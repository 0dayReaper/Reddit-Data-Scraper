    "postText": "First time traveler to Europe/solo. I just booked a flight from NYC to London to start my 2 month trip to Europe, and separate flights to get to NYC then London&gt;Spain. Have basically zero plans otherwise. The JFK&gt;London flight includes a carry on, but the two flights to London and to Spain do not. Do you guys recommend just bringing a 40L back and a daypack, or did you prefer/worth it to bring a normal personal item bag + a roller suitcase? Leaning towards just the 40l for ease, but I plan on taking mostly trains after getting to Europe so the carryon additional fees wouldn't amount to too much more. Thank you for the input!",

Yes, there are cobblestone streets, but you probably won\u2018t need to walk endless miles with it, as you surely drop it off at your hotel or in a locker anyways.  If you chose backpack, PLEASE take it off in public transport (and shops!) and carry it in you hand, on leg level. These things take of so much space on torso level and smack fellow citizens in the face when turning around - the ones sitting or smaller than you -  you won\u2018t even really notice (and you will be very sorry &amp; embarrassed when you do).  Backpackers don\u2019t seem to realize how much space they take up. Esp when everyone is standing tight, absolute no go to keep it on your back. Put it on the floor like a suitcase for the benefit and safety of the people around you. It also will save space, since the leg level has more space then torso height",

Been a backpack, carry on, and a (high quality and empty) drawsting bag/or like the ultralight osprey foldable backpack kind of person since. \n\nOnly time to do heavy backpacks is if you go camping or long hike I guess. Where you need to carry a tent. (Personally haven't been camping before but is imagine this was the (one of) the only real time to go backpack only. \n\n\n\nCarry on luggage: Clothes, shoes (enough for 2 weeks no laundry and still have some space). Toiletries. (Leave in hotel)\n\nBacpack: Tech, Chargers, miscellaneous stuff you might need. (Since it's not stuffed to the brim, it's easier to find shit you need when you are on the road). (If you get to the hotel early you can leave your luggage, and keep this bag with you and the important stuff with you - this should not be too uncomfortable since only laptop and some smaller things should be in it. After check in you can leave this in the room and bring the Drawstring bag with you instead)\n\nDrawstring bag: bring it with me on the day, water and snacks + anything else you need. (I carry this empty or with a tissue box from the hotel and then fill it with a water bottle and some snacks for the day/more. Drawstring hurts when I carry heavier content, I am looking at the osprey foldable bag to use instead since it has classic wider straps)\n\nFanny/Sling: Passport, wallet. Sunscreen, portable charger you can put in this bag or Drawstring bag.",

            "comment": "I recently purchased a 73L wheeled duffel that you can wear as a backpack if need be. It served me great for 2 weeks in Cambodia (just finished up there). There was a lot of space in my bag and I could definitely see myself packing pretty much the same amount for 2 months in Europe if travelling in the summer months.\n\nI\u2019ve done Europe a few times and have found that as long as the bag is good quality and you\u2019re careful, a wheeled bag is not a problem on the cobble stones. Have travelled for 3 months in eastern and western Europe by train, bus and plane with a 94L wheeled duffle with no issue. ONCE in Edinburgh I had a hell of a lot of stairs to climb up with the bag but I switched to duffle and it was fine. A bit of a workout but it was only 5 mins and still overall felt the wheeled duffel was the better call over the backpack.\n\nI like the versatility of the 3-in-1 wheeled duffel backpack because it\u2019s easy enough to carry the bag upstairs as a duffel which means I can keep my day pack on my back.\n\nThe times where I\u2019ve committed to a backpack-only style bag I\u2019ve regretted it because it always seemed I was carrying all this weight on my back for no reason. The option of wheels is always a life saver. However, I usually stay in hostels and don\u2019t really \u2018rough\u2019 it or do long hikes or camping so it depends on your travel style.",

In the handbag I carry the tickets, water, one snack, etc. so I don't have to unload the backpack each time. Sometimes also bring a reusable textile bag for food, which mostly fits on the 40L backpack.\n\nIn a lot of places there can be a lot of stairs (e.g. metro in Paris) or cobblestone.

A lot of airlines have 8kg (17.6lb limit) or even 7kg (15.4lb) limit for budget or regional airlines, so that should hopefully keep the weight low, even though in my experience they often aren't weighed. And obviously it depends on your specific situation how practical or comfortable this would be for you. Some people, like me, carrying 8kg isn't an issue, but for others it will be (no judgement or anything - we all have different situations and thoughts in our life). So keep that in mind when you read reviews pushing one way or the other. If you don't think it'll be comfortable for you to carry a heavy backpack for an extended period of time, then it might not be worth considering even if there are 100 other reasons you would want to.\n\nAlso re-reading your question, I think a lot of places would consider the 40L pack a carry on. It kind of sounds like your question is only calling the roller a carry on and the bag as a way around the extra fees associated, but I think a bag the size of 40L will often be viewed as a carry on and charged as such, even if you don't have another bag.

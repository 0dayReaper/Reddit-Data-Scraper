    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am interested in traveling through the Canadian Maritimes (provinces of PEI, Nova Scotia, NB plus Newfoundland) solo and without renting a car later this summer (end of July- August). \n\nTentatively, I think that I should set up a base in Halifax for a month and visit some of the interesting places for a 2-3 day trips. Alternatively, this can be a 2 week long trip of continuous travel. The destinations I am interested in include Halifax, Lunenburg, Cape Breton, PEI red beaches and St. Johns). \n\nI know that public transit is not reliable in this part of the world but is it impossible to visit the Maritimes without a car? \n\nI am budgeting about 50-100$ a day including transport and stay. Would that be too limiting?\n\nI would be happy to hear any suggestions or ideas.",

            "comment": "I'm worried about your ability to get a rental car this late into the game. I'd look at NB or NS as the likely cheaper (but not cheap) places to rent a vehicle. \n\nNewfoundland is vast and could easily take 2 weeks total. I will leave it to others to tell you if it's worth visiting just for St. John's as I'm not the most city-focused traveller. \n\nLogistics aside, here are some lesser visited places I liked in NS that you could consider checking out: Joggin's Fossil Cliffs, Cape Split, Kejimkujik National Seashore. For Cape Breton, I really loved Meat Cove Mountain as a less known area.",

            "comment": "Leave NL off your trip (tentatively). You can fly to St. John\u2019s from any maritime province if you feel like you want to. There is maritime bus service. It\u2019s runs everyday from places like Halifax to pei moncton Cape Breton etc. You can book hotels/ motels in each city and use the bus every few days to get around. You will mainly have to stick to the cities but there is still a lot to see. You will not make it to lunenberg without a vehicle unless there\u2019s some touristy shuttle run and there are basically zero hostels left post pandemic. It\u2019s not like going to Europe or Toronto where your going to have a hostel set up with all sorts of travellers backpacking etc. the Hi Hostel in Halifax is shut down as far as I know. Don\u2019t underestimate the size. Especially Newfoundland. \n\nIf I were you I\u2019d first come to Halifax and expedite the whole area. Public transit can get you anywhere in the city. If you can make it to Peggy\u2019s cove or lunenberg somehow since you\u2019ll be here for so long do it. But it may be difficult. I\u2019d take maritime bus to whichever New Brunswick city interest you the most after that. When done there is do pei. After pei id do Cape Breton and then MAYBE I\u2019d take the boat and bust to St. John\u2019s. But if st Johns is is your only preferred destination id look to fly without my own vehicle.",

Feel free to PM me.\n\nEdit: what are you planning on for accommodations? $200 a day could easily be spent on a hotel.",

You could try to hitchhike, I suppose, but it may be a long time between rides and even in relatively safe and friendly Eastern Canada, I wouldn't recommend this.\n\nEven if you bring a tent and plan to camp, you'll need to book campsites well in advance, and your budget won't be possible. You can save money by shopping only at grocery stores, storing food in a cooler in your trunk, and self-cooking or picnicking. But if you want a roof over your head, accommodation is expensive. For instance, even a dorm bed at several popular Halifax hostels is running close to $100/night. Try looking on sites like Booking.com to get an idea of pricing.\n\nThere may be some bus tours out of Halifax to popular sites like Peggy's Cove, but I expect they're on buses packed with senior citizens and less of interest to you. Alternately, you can look into multi-day guided hiking tours around Nova Scotia, though they will be well above your budget. If you hang around Halifax and maybe inquire in some student social media spaces, you might find others to team up with and rent a car to go on sightseeing trips together, but this is something you may need to ask around about.",

I know it has a reputation as a drive-through province, but the Fundy/Alma/Hopewell Cape area might be worth examining as an option en route from Halifax to PEI.\n\nAlso, if you can\u2019t rent a car, forget this whole trip.\n\nAlso note that a lot of the beaches on PEI are miserably packed in July-August. Do some research on beaches further from the main tourist centres. Western PEI has some options.\n\nAs for accommodations, just know that many hostels in the Maritimes aren\u2019t your typical young backpacker circuit hostels. They\u2019re often more the \u201cmiddle aged men who can\u2019t afford other permanent homes\u201d type of hostels, particularly in cities. Research thoroughly.",

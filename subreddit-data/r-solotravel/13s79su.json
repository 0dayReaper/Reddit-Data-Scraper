    "postText": "Hi! I am going on a solo-trip to India for the second time. One month, from Delhi to Manali/Vashisht and back. I am a 33 y/o female from Norway. Have travelled alone In India before, when I was 23 - so 10 years ago! The last time I met some people I became friends with already at the Airport and we travelled together all the way up from Mumbai to the north. And after that I continued on by myself, with no problems- just a little precaution and the occasional fear (but no harassment or anything). I was wondering if anyone has recent experiences travelling in northern India? Especially if you are a female travelling solo? Would really appreciate any tips! \nAnd also: please no comments about \u201cnot going at all\u201d because I have booked the trip and it\u2019s going to happen.",

            "comment": "Not superrr recent but in 2019 I traveled to India solo- New Delhi, Rishikesh, Agra. I spent a month in the North (Rishikesh). I wouldn\u2019t call my entire experience solo because I was there for a yoga teacher training, and made friends who I then traveled with. Since you\u2019ve been to India, I probably don\u2019t have a ton of advice you haven\u2019t already learned about. \n\nEven though it was the middle of summer I made sure to wear long pants when out and about, and usually kept my shoulders covered. (No tank tops) Definitely helped me draw less attention as a foreigner and I wanted to be respectful, especially in a holy city. \n\n  From what I witnessed with my friends, if you are blonde/ blue eyed you will have a ton of men asking for selfies. Never saw them get grabby or creepy, but totally valid to decline. I was able to legally bring pepper spray with me in my checked bag which made me feel a bit safer. (although I know this isn\u2019t possible to obtain if you\u2019re in Norway). I spent a lot of time walking the city by myself and only once had guy try to follow me, in the middle of the day. I honestly felt safer in India than I did in Nicaragua (went there solo in 2016 when it was still \u201csafe\u201d before the political unrest started).",

I have heard stories of people that have been harassed and bullied by groups of taxi drivers, and I am just scared it will be a problem. Did you take tuk-tuks? I did in 2013, but also keep reading people warning about them.",

So didn\u2019t have to deal with sketchy taxis in the middle of the night. I used Uber in Delhi. Oh! Super important- if using Uber do NOT book the Uber Go option (whichever is the cheapest option). I made that mistake when I was booking my Uber (leaving the airport hotel to go stay with my college friend at her apartment). \n\nThe cars are extremely tiny and they put your luggage on top of the car in a basket! I tried to use hand motions to insist he put my luggage in the front seat and he refused. It\u2019s not even strapped down (so anyone could come up to the car, grab your luggage at a stoplight, run off). And the driver did not understand the GPS directions (??) and actually got out of the car at a stoplight to ask some random people on the side of the road!! \n\nThankfully my college friend (she\u2019s American/didn\u2019t speak any Hindi) was able to put her friend on the phone who speaks Hindi and he was able to direct the driver to her address. \n\nSo yeah, always go with the Uber premium option, it\u2019s not that much more money. The drivers are much better, usually speak some basic English, and it will be an actual sedan where your luggage is stored in the trunk, lol.",

They had 14 day and 28 day SIM cards for India. It\u2019s much more expensive than just doing it in India, but that\u2019s an option. For reference, I paid 500 rupees for my 2 week SIM card. I hope you have an amazing trip. There\u2019s no need to be nervous, trust your intuition. Some of the greatest people I know I met in India.",

Almost all from travel tickets to food ordering there is a app. Having a visa/master card will be comfortable, most retail outlets will accept it. Just have secondary bank card to protect from cyber fraud. (we indian to have it)",

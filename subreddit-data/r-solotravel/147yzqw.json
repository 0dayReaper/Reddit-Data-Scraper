    "postText": "Hey y'all, thanks in advance for the help!\n\nThis is so strange to me, but here is the situation:\n\nI booked through the booking agency Gate1, for flights from SWISS (partly executed by Edelweiss). I saw a discrepancy about checked baggage on the email from Gate1 and the site from SWISS, so I called SWISS to confirm. They said yes, you have checked baggage, it's in our logs so you can disregard that email. I asked them to confirm this statement on an email, to which they happily oblige. \n\nSo then I get an email from Lufthansa, and I do see I have checked baggage in the information. But I also see my first name written as Mariemrs. I understand it stands for Mrs of course, but wth? Also I see a random phone number in my information that me and internet don't recognize. \n\nI call them again to ask about this, mainly the name thing, and they tell me it happens more often, they know about it, it won't be an issue etc. So I ask again, okay can you confirm this in an email and they refuse! I spent 20 minutes on the phone with them, and they just refused to confirm this. \n\nNow I'm stuck with this anxiety that I go to the airport and I won't be let through. Has anyone experienced something like this? Why do airlines/booking agencies make things so confusing?! The phone number, the name, the checked baggage. It costs both/all three of us time and money this way!!",

Because if you do, you will find out they probably tried to scam you with baggage allowance (trying to make you \"buy\" something which is already included).",

    "postText": "Hi! My husband and I met 9 years ago, our son just turned 4. In all that time I\u2019ve been on a plane once (I\u2019m in Colorado). \n\nThis is going to sound nerdy but I am so here goes: I am a huge Stephen King fan! When I learned Stephen King\u2019s birthday was the day before mine I badgered my husband non stop until he agreed to let me go to Maine for my birthday and fully nerd out in the places that inspired my favorite books and have some much needed me time! I\u2019ll be there late September! \n\nI used to travel a lot with my family when I was younger but the East coast is a mystery to me (DC class trip in 8th grade is my full experience on that side of US) \n\nI\u2019m pretty comfortable doing things by myself, but I\u2019ve never been away from my son and husband except one night! \n\nI\u2019d like to not stick out as a tourist! I realize even though I\u2019ll still be in US that\u2019s a very different region with their own local customs and what not. \n\n3 questions:\n1) I\u2019ll be there for 4 days, how shall I maximize my adventure? Specifically what would be enjoyable for a person on their own in Maine? (My only set plans are the Stephen King\u2019s Derry Tour, and hiking in Acadia National park on my birthday! I\u2019ll be staying in Bangor). \n\n2) what should I avoid doing/saying so I can have friendly interactions with locals? Any local customs/ do\u2019s/don\u2019ts?\n\n3)Tell me about your trip to the area if you have ever been?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Try to stop in some of those little towns if you can. The working waterfronts in Maine are something that you won\u2019t find in a lot of places. \n\nSimilarly, if you\u2019re going from Bangor to Acadia and aren\u2019t in any kind of hurry you can drive down to castine or blue hill or even deer isle. \n\nI love driving the coast of maine because there are always little peninsulas and islands that feel like hidden gems to find.",

I rented a bike and cycled through Arcadia but it's such a beypark, you can't go wrong with any activity. I would also recommend a scenic cruise through Frenchman's Bay. There are a ton of lighthouses to see and wildlife like eagles, seals, whales (depending on the time of year). Try to find a lobster shack on the side of the road. Nothing beats whole, fresh steamed lobster! \nI'm also a huge Stephen King fan. I took a picture in front of his house and stopped at every IT reference in Bangor. Have fun!",

Really nothing special - Maine has a huge tourism industry and we get people from all over visiting a lot. Just be polite and you'll be fine. Also if you're excited to be there that's probably clear you're a tourist, but it's really ok.\n\nI'm really trying to think, the only thing is we tend to be more a Dunks area than Starbucks in most towns? I visited Colorado a few years ago and that was the biggest difference in culture to me! Oh, and a minor pet peeve - if in a very touristy area you want to ask for restaurant recommendations give a price range/vibe (seafood shack vs cafe vs fancy) and location instead of asking where the locals eat - we eat one town over where prices are lower a good chunk of the time, and it's frustrating to be asked \"where do you eat?\" when I have no idea what sort of range I'm supposed to provide.\n\nThe biggest things I miss are the seafood shacks near beaches! \n\nHope it's a great trip!",

I will have a rental car so I won\u2019t be limited to only Bangor :) \n\nThe reason for question 2 is, I\u2019ve had 2 friends \u201cinform\u201d me I have unpopular opinions I need to keep to myself while there, such as : I hate tom brady\u2026..for the last decade I have woken up every morning and hated tom brady before I got out of bed \ud83d\ude02 also\u2026I\u2019m terrified of seafood and you couldn\u2019t get a bite of lobster roll in me with a gun to my head!

My fave experiences there were hiking Cadillac Mtn. We also got a lobster roll that was amazing (tho prices for rolls are $40 now). We also took a boat trip on a lobster boat where they took you out on a boat and showed you how they pull up the traps etc. \n\nPortland is an ok place but i wouldnt go out of my way to spend time there.",

You can walk down main street and just every third building is vacant or else something temporary seeming like a low end weed store.  (and the two mall areas are like, liminal spaces gif collections but I wouldn't think anyone would come as a tourist to go to the mall)\n\nI guess, look at it a little kindly, downtown wasn't always a boarded up gas station next to a boarded up pizza place next to a street of abandoned houses next to a closed shoe store next to an abandoned sports good store next to two abandoned restaurants next a weed store next to a weed store and hopefully it won't be that way forever.",

There's a large craft brewing scene in Maine so go try a local brewery like Orono Brewing Company if your into that. Bissell Bros is also a nice beer company local in Maine that you'll find on many bar taps. I saw you're from Colorado so I have to reccommend you try some Maine bud, Firestorm has a really nice selection! Also since you're staying in Bangor, The Bangor City Forest is a beautiful way to spend the day. \n\nIt's a really nice city, just avoid the homeless and you should be fine. The only time I was threatened there was by a high bum so just a warning. Oh and since you're doing the King thing, check out Mt. Hope Cemetery in Bangor!",

    "postText": "I just got back from my biggest solo trip so far. I travelled the furthest that I ever have alone to a country that doesn't speak the same language. The trip was amazing. I planned it well (but not too much) and everything worked out. I have a friend that lives there, so I got to hang out with her a few times. But it made me realise how much I missed social interaction and having someone around. \n\nNow I'm thinking ahead to my next trip in 9 months time. Even though I love planning and being organised, I'm feeling prematurely exhausted at the thought of managing everything by myself once again. Like, carrying heavy luggage, the language barrier, unexpected cancellations, dealing with any problems by myself. It's not that I don't enjoy solo travel, but I wish my holidays could be more varied and involve other people sometimes. I really miss having someone else to hang with and being able to switch off my brain during a holiday. \n\nMy next trip is in February so I have lots of time, but I'm already anxious about picking between different transport options. At least if something goes wrong, you have the support of another person and they can help keep the problem in perspective. But alone, it can get super stressful. \n\nI think I'm mentally burned out at the moment. Post-pandemic I've done 4 trips so far, plus 1 within my country that I'm not really counting...I hope I can recover from this feeling in time for my next trip, because I'm supposed to be celebrating my birthday during it! Maybe my next next holiday should be an all inclusive resort or something, but they can get very expensive.\n\nDoes anyone else get this sometimes?",

Another option is to find a job or a work away somewhere and just hang out and not have to worry about things to do?\n\nDo not feel bad for doing something like an all inclusive! I've got some great spots in Vietnam and Thailand that fit this mold without being touristy where you can just relax and not worry about anything but be in some beautiful places!

Doing your Google research beforehand (directions from accommodation to transport, knowing how long it will take, the process of using the transport, etc) so you're prepared. Not scheduling anything else on travel days. Having enough in the budget that you can pay for other transport if needed. Splurging for easier times/types of transit.",

Europe may be easier to get around, especially UK or Ireland, which can take some off the stress off.\n\n- have you considered a tour (you can find a lot of them on tourradar and viator). This is how I have mostly traveled the past years due to being too mentally exhausted to plan, but traveling around somehow calms me and gives me a different headspace than a resort. Many people seem to have misunderstandings about what it is actually like. In my experience, everyone was happy to talk and hang out at times, and everyone was fine if you wanted to doze, stare out the window, or just see the site alone. Evenings are free to stay in, go out alone, or meet up with your tour friends. You get taken to fun stuff but your biggest decision of the day is likely what to have for dinner, followed by what time to set your alarm to be ready for pickup. All tours I have done have been different but lovely. Some of them are expensive but some are rather affordable. I find 4-6 days is about my sweet spot. You know each other on a deeper level, but no one is too exhausted yet. \n\n- people often talk about hostels, but I rarely see the difference between city and country hostels discussed. I love country hostels, friendly calm home atmosphere, kitchen, relaxed people who often do a lot of hiking and taking in some local highlights, I have rarely been in a country hostel where I didn't make at least 1 friend in the first hour and spent one or more dats with them. City hostels I often find much less personable, I am far too boring and old for party hostels, most people are with their group, there may be a school trip or six, people just want some peace and quiet finally, or just feel because everthing feels like a bit like a library that they shouldn't really interact. I have had chats over breakfast and stuff, but plenty of times I didn't speak to anyone but reception. Maybe I am staying in the wrong places, but I feel like city hostels can really give a very different impression of what hostels can be. Maybe you have tried and it just isn't for you, but maybe something to consider.\n\n- traveling lighter: /onebag and /heronebag are great sources of inspiration.",

Basically any trip over 1000 for a week that doesn't include accommodation is unlikely to attract my attention at current inflation rates. So that influences my list. \n\nfor Scotland\n- I did a 10 day tour (prepandemic) with Haggis Adventures which included Lewis&amp;Harris, Skye, Loch Ness, Orkney and the highlands. Big bus, aimed at a younger crowd, accommodation not included, fun crowd.\n- discover Scotland tours, did a 4 day Mull, Ulva, Iona trip included part of the same highlands. Small bus, accommodation not included, nice and quiet way to travel.\n- Caledonian Travel. Ended up in the Lake District because the cairngorms one got canceled due to lack of bookings. Aimed at local pensioners mostly. Went with a friend and apart from the one family that took their daughter we were 20-45 years junior. Amazing value, included accommodation, breakfast and dinner, big bus. Would use them again for the price but would want a friend on that tour. Also leave from Hull area.\n- Rabbies I didn't personally use, and I heard good things from people I met on tour. Very similar to discover Scotland, did basically the same tour, but didn't have Ulva I believe and didn't have a pickup from Glasgow. That one was generally quieter (our bus was full) for that tour but I hear the Skye one gets booked full. Had a chat with the driver on the ferry back from Iona, lovely bloke. They have more options across the uk and Ireland so thought I would include it. I have my eye on their Wales tour for when it fits into my schedule for a minibreak.\n\nIreland\n- paddywagon tours. Aimed at young travellers, big busses, def fewer young people post covid when i used them last year. A woman had gone with her student daughter pre covid and had been the only over 30, our tour she was average age. Good value with accommodation included. But you get what you pay for, it was a bit messy starting back up. Still a fun trip and would use them again for the value they offered.\n- shamrock adventures, didn't use it (yet) and hasn't reopened since covid. Friends from  the haggis tour went on to use that one and said it was very similar but included accommodation.\n- rabbies, mentioned above",

Unfortunately, this is just the experience of the solo traveller, I think. I don\u2019t have a solution except maybe to pack less so you don\u2019t have such heavy luggage to deal with. I think this is why some people go on group tours, because all the decisions are made for them and all the problems are solved for them.

The freedom of doing whatever you want all the time comes with the burden of being 100% responsible for every single detail (and mishap) on your trip. I do my best to relax into that reality and take everything in stride. The worst that ever happens (to me) is I end up spending a bunch more money cause something got effed up. It's never the end of the world or anything. And in my opinion working your way through those tough times is incredibly formative and just makes you a stronger and more capable individual.\n\nThe social aspect though, that's a little harder for me. I think I'm slowly coming to the conclusion that I don't actually want to solo travel very often anymore, if at all. I don't get the same kick out of it -- I mostly just wish someone was there to share it with, and then that puts even more of a damper on my experience.\n\nBut if you genuinely enjoy the solo experience, I would say just power through the stress and uncertainty that inevitably comes with that and lean into the whole thing as a practice in growth and learning.",

Each option comes with it's own (dis)advantages. If it's hard for you to choose it basically means they're largely equal for you. Just pick a random option. Or even better stay flexible and choose nothing and just see how things go and decide on the spot. Flexibility is imho the best way to prevent stress. The more you plan the more things can go wrong.

                            "comment": "&gt; You can't expect a reasonable level of English. \n\nWhy not? Maybe a definition issue, but loads of non-native speakers have excellent English. Unless you go to China or another large language area with comparatively little exposure to English you'll encounter English speakers about everywhere. At least enough to have a little chat every once in while and for functional things translation apps are perfectly adequate to arrange the essentials. No reason to struggle for that if you don't want to. Google translate covers the native language of about 70% of the world population, Baidu translate has even more languages. Given that the majority of the world population speaks 2, 3 or more languages it's very rare that it won't work, even more so for the essentials a tourist may need.\n\n&gt; but flights are the things you do have to book in advance\n\nNo, it's a choice to book them in advance. You can go to the airport and book your flight there and then if you want to. And if flights cause you so much stress maybe just cut down on flights? I mean if you book your return flight from home and limit yourself and don't try to see the whole world in one trip there is little need for other flights. \n\n&gt; so I want to make sure I'm booking the best option. \n\nSure, but if you can't decide that means there is no clear 'best option'. If they're about the same anyway, sure each with their own (dis)advantages, then throw a dice and pick randomly from the contenders. If over-analyzing the options cause you so much anxiety I'm sure that the tiny difference between the options is not worth it. At some point you've to choose the good enough option over the non-existing perfect option.\n\n&gt; it was just an example and I'm talking about when it's full of souvenirs and gifts at the end of trip,\n\nThe point stands, why not pack less? Throw away old clothes, buy less crap.... If heavy luggage is a burden to you that's easy to fix, have a look at the ultralight crowd. In the end it's of course a balancing act between different (dis)advantages, but if weight is an issue then have a serious look at everything you put in your bag and ask yourself whether you really need it. If the answer is yes, fair enough, but then you know why you do it and is it apparently worth it for you to have heavy luggage.\n\n&gt; Again these were just examples of times when managing everything by yourself can be stressful.\n\nWhat is there really to manage? Obviously, if things go wrong at a critical point in time it can be stressful, but as said, if you stay flexible that takes away a lot of stress. Maybe a bit of anxiety for the flight to your destination and your return flight and for the rest, just take it as it comes. If you know you've anxiety issue then plan your trip in a way that avoids the triggers. Yeah, that may mean you've to compromise somewhere but I'm sure that's a better choice than letting your trip get destroyed by anxiety issues. And if you're not able to do that, then maybe seek professional help.",

You sound very inflexible, the point I make is that you should look at your options and make the choices that suit you instead of mindlessly doing whatever you do. You complain about anxiety over transport options, must choose the best option etc. Reality is you don't need the best option, you need an option that's good enough. By stressing about that you need the best option you get a worse option then by picking just a good enough option as your quest for the best option causes you anxiety issues. Same with your luggage, if you think the luggage is too heavy than pack less. Maybe do laundry a bit more often, save money by not buying crappy souvenirs that you've no use for. etc. \n\n&gt; not everyone can travel in the way you do.\n\nWho is talking about how I travel? I'm telling you to cut out things that cause you anxiety. To give it a proper thought whether what you do is the right thing to do. There are many ways to do things sometimes the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, fine, then accept the disadvantages that come with it. If not then change something. If certain things cause you serious anxiety issues then look at how you can cut them out.\n\n&gt; I feel like you've missed the point of my post\n\nThen what is that point? You just want to complain about your anxiety issues?",

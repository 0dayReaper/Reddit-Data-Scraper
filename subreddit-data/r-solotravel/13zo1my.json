    "postText": "Hey folks, \n\nI am planning to do a 14-16 day solo trip to Japan in September. My plan includes:\n\n* 3-4 days initially in Tokyo to check shrines, gardens, and Mount Fuji\n* Day trip to Nikko National Park from Tokyo\n* 3 days in Yakushima\n* 2  days in Daisetsuzan National Park\n* 2 days in Akan Mashu National Park\n* 3 days in Shirteko National Park\n* Wrapping up with 1-2 days in Tokyo\n\nMy interests are in roaming the city (not too much into museums now), checking out neighborhoods, and national parks. \n\n* Does the plan seem feasible to do in the time frame? Or should I cut out 1/2  national parks, which ones basis your experience will you recommend removing?\n* Any other national parks which may be more attuned (than my list) to day hikes (not looking to do multi-day or difficult hikes as such)?\n* Is Hokkaido possible to do without a car, my search so far leads me to think public transportation may  be more limited than other areas? Will this be even more harder in September?\n* Would you recommend a guided tour to cover the national parks rather than self plan this?\n* Also, searching on Booking brings up properties around Hokkaido National Parks which are super expensive, is lodging really expensive in Hokkaido or it is easier to book from some other Japan site rather than international OTAs?\n\nThank you so much.",

            "comment": "This is an unusual itinerary for a first time traveler to Japan but it would certainly be doable. I believe that Hokkaido is more sparsely populated so there may be fewer public transport options but I have never been there. While you\u2019re in Nikko, make sure you check out the temples there, not just the National park. Also, Tokyo isn\u2019t really the place if you want to check out shrine/temples. There is sensoji temple. But if you\u2019re interested in historic temples Kyoto would be a good bet.",

            "comment": "While the mobility in Japan is awesome and the parks themselves look fabulous, for the time you're going I'd recommend cutting down on travel time and staying more central. You're planning to visit practically the most northern and most southern tip of a massive country, while skipping a whole bunch that's worth seeing in between. It will also save you some money, as the bullet train system is divided in zones and it will cost you a lot extra to buy a pass that lets you travel between zones.\n\nIf it's beautiful nature you're looking for, the Japanese Alps are practically right next to Tokyo, with a few national parks that are worth visiting. I'd recommend Matsumoto and/or Takayama as cities in this region.\n\nUnless you really don't like cities I also wouldn't skip Osaka and Kyoto. You don't need more than one or two days in Osaka, but it has an interesting vibe. Kyoto is culturally significant and it could take you a week to visit all of the temples here, but you need at least two days to catch the biggest attractions. From here you could visit himeji as its just a short train ride if castles appeal to you, but Matsumoto and Osaka also have cool castles.\n\nThe Tokyo itinerary looks good. 3 days is definitely enough for Tokyo, as much as I love the city + another day for a trip to Nikka (which I'd highly recommend). If you're interested in seeing Mt Fuji, I'd recommend Hakone national park. You could do this as a day trip from Tokyo, but you could also stay in the nearby town of Odawara, or even in Hakone itself. If the weather is good you can see Fuji from the park. From there you can also still get closer to the foot of the mountain if you want.\n\nBare in mind that the things I suggested above barring a night in Hiroshima is almost exactly how I spent my own 15 day trip in Japan, and that was quite a fast paced trip already. But it's doable at the least, and all of the things I recommended are very easily reachable by public transport with not a single travel time over 3 hours.",

    "postText": "I'm planning a trip to Kyrgyzstan, but just would like your advice on the general logistics of getting around in the country. I've been reading a lot of reddit posts, blogs, and articles about traveling in Kyrgyzstan, but would like to hear a bit more from those of you who have been to the country. \n\nI don't want to rent a car and plan to use public transportation to get around ie. marshrutkas. But how do you travel from one remote place or national park to another? For example, I am trying to go from Chong-Kemin National Park to Song Kul, but it's hard for me to know if there are marshrutkas going between these two places. \n\nIs using public transportation really viable if I just want to hit the highlights of the country? I am hoping to go with the following itinerary:\n\nBishkek -- &gt;Song-Kul --&gt; Skazka Canyon --&gt; Karakol/Issy-kul --&gt; Cholpon Ata --&gt; Chong Kemin --&gt; Burana --&gt; Bishkek\n\nI am planning to give myself about 2 weeks, taking out visit locations if necessary.",

Song Kul will be trickier, if you\u2019re going anywhere that\u2019s harder to get to by public transit I suggest popping in the community based tourism offices, they\u2019re super helpful, have offices all over the country, and they can organize tours, or a driver, homestays etc. And there\u2019s always hitchhiking if you have to, it\u2019s pretty easy there!",

However It won't work outside big cities but still you can easily find a taxi at most of the places. Your host can help you with that.\n\nShared taxi &amp; mashrutka will go only to the village. National park entrances can be far away sometimes but you can negotiate with the shared taxi drivers to drop you further.\n\nYou should get share taxi or mashrutka for most of the places since that's how the locals travel and Shared taxi will leave only after it gets full. It could take a while sometimes. If you don't want to wait you can pay for the entire taxi.",

It's part of a much bigger trip and I'm finding it hard to get too detailed on any single leg of the trip except for the first parts. \n\nMy current thinking is to go through Kyrgyzstan and up to Almaty in Kazakhstan and rent the vehicle there. An alternative would be to rent in Kyrgyz as you can often take the vehicles across the border. \n\nI definitely want to check out Charyn canyon, maybe the singing dune, and absolutely the Altyn Emel mountains because they just look so dope. Maybe an overnight hike at Kolsai Lake.\n\nI haven't really mapped that all out on a map yet. I'll probably be doing it late September which is when prices drop for vehicle rentals so that's a plus, and Kazakhstan has some of the cheapest fuel out there so I figure splashing out might not set me back too much.\n\nI agree it's a pretty isolating activity to self drive without others to join.

    "postText": "Hi all, I'll be spending 11 days in Spain (first time) this coming December. I'm planning to spend 3 nights each in Madrid and Barcelona. Wondering if it's a good idea to go Granada as the third city since it's pretty far from the two? I've always wanted to explore the whole Andalucia so idk if it's better to leave Granada for when I come back. \n\nI heard San Sebastian is mostly for food and wine (not super into the two when I'm travelling) and got mixed reviews for Valencia so maybe not those two. I like architecture, aimless walks and day hikes (not sure if it's a good idea in Spanish winter) so wanna know your reccos, thanks!",

            "comment": "On one hand,Granada is a more interesting city IMHO than the others you mentioned.\n\nOn the other, it's out of your way, and as you say easily combined with the rest of Andalusia rather than with places like Barcelona.\n\nPersonally I'd visit some places nearer to where you are going already... either a major city like Valencia which is fast and easy to get to between Madrid and Barcelona,or some smaller place.\n\nFor example Girona near Barcelona is great.\n\nSimilarly Toledo or Segovia near Madrid.",

Toledo and Segovia are both tremendous cities near Madrid where you could easily spend a few days.  Tarragona is about 60 km south of Barcelona, and has some of the most interesting Roman ruins in Spain (as well as delicious food about 25% cheaper than Barcelona).\n\nIf you can rent a car, Albarracin is a small, breathtakingly beautiful town in Arragon, and you could easily hit Cuenca and Teruel in the same region.  Very different geographically and architecturally from the two big cities.\n\nIf you can't rent a car, Zaragoza is also worth 2-3 days, and is halfway between Madrid and Barcelona.",

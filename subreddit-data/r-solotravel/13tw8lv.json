    "postText": "Hi there, on the 2nd week of June I'm planning to do a solo nature-focused trip to these places, I'll end at Munich because I want to catch a direct train to home Bologna from there. I was hoping for some critiques about this plan. Here is the rough itinerary that I planned:\n\nDay 1: Take the train from Florence to Bolzano. It leaves at 8:34am from Florence station. After reaching Bolzano, get the 350 bus Plan to Ortisei which leaves at 12:24pm. Ask the tourist office for ticket information. Check in to Ortisei hotel and explore nearby places.\n\nDay 2: Wake up early in the morning and explore Alpe Di Siusi. In the afternoon, go to Seceda via cable car. Relax in nature the whole day\n\nDay 3: Catch the Innsbruck train from Bolzano which leaves at 10:34am. To do that, catch the 350 bus back to Bolzano at 9am. Once reaching Innsbruck, climb the Nordkette cable car and get amazed at the view there. Explore nearby places as well.\n\nDay 4: Take the train to Seefeld in Tirol. Train leaves every 30 minutes starting from 6:35am. Go there as early as possible and explore there. Come to Innsbruck in the evening probably. The last train back is 11:16pm.\n\nDay 5: Take the train to Garmisch-Partenkirchen and leave the Innsbruck hotel. The first train is in 8:08am, try to catch that. Otherwise, catch the 10:08am train. After checking in the Garmisch hotel, explore Partnach Gorge. It is open until 8pm so you are fine. After finishing Partnach Gorge, go to Graseckseilbahn if you have time.\n\nDay 6: Today climb Zugspitze. Ask the tourist office or research on how to take the bus to Eibsee cable car and then climb Zugspitze. Once you do that, take the bus to Munich. Remember that Garmisch to Munich FlixBus is safe because there are no stops along the way. It leaves every two hours and the last bus is 8:25pm from Garmisch. Overnight at Munich.\n\nDay 7: Explore Munich. Then today go to Allianz Arena to take the tour. Tour begins at 10am. Then go to Nymbenburg palace or Munich Residence. Keep exploring the whole day.\n\nDay 8: Take the train to Bologna at 1:34pm. Wake up early, check out from hotel, put it in luggage storage and keep exploring more till train departure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm open to any suggestions/critiques or going to alternative places. I was also wondering if I should do day trip from Munich to Garmisch, or just stay at Garmisch. Please help me out. Thank you!",

            "comment": "Sounds awesome! I'm planning to hit a couple of those places on a trip myself, but haven't been there yet. \n\nMy only question is on Day 2. Can you do both Alpe Di Siusi and Saceda in the same day? Maybe if you're quick and don't do much hiking around. \n\nAlso, how do you get back to Bolzano the next day? Can you take a bus that early to make your 10:30 train?",

It\u2019s not possible for me to do harder hikes since I get too tired lol. And to catch the train there\u2019s bus 350 from Ortisei to Bolzano at 9am that day. Also, which places are you gonna go from the list?",

    "postText": "Posted this in onebag also but trying to get some more responses...\n\nTrying to decide on a sling to pack in my onebag for carrying stuff around while traveling &amp; was wondering if anyone else has compared these 3 (or other options)\n\nI'd like to be able to carry an 11\" tablet, small packable rain jacket, maybe a soft water bottle like the 16 oz Vapur, and other small \"essentials\"\n\nI was looking at the Pacsafe Metrosafe X (not sure if the tablet will fit), Alpaka Bravo X, and the Aer Day Sling 3 Max. All are around 5-6L which seems like a good balance of size &amp; storage. Not sure if the additional safety options of the pacsafe are really needed or not...but seem like a good idea since I'll be traveling solo\n\nAnyone else compare these &amp; choose one (or a different one)?",

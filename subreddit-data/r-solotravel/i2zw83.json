My first major solo trip was flying into Cusco, Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, then overland via Lake Titicaca, La Paz to Arica, continuingdown the length of Chile via Calama to Santiago (I've also gone La Paz via Salar de Uyuni to Chile on a separate trip) where I came down paralyzed, 10 days in the hospital and had to return home.  Flew back to resume the trip, Easter Island, then across to Mendoza in Argentina.  Flew to Buenos  Aires then to Cape Town, South Africa.  Went overland to Johannesburg.  Then took a month-long overland safari truck via Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania before ending in Kenya.  Flew to the Seychelles for a week before returning to the USA via France and the UK.",

Most of my trips were fairly short, 2-3 weeks at most, other than combined work/vacation trips (India) where I'd spend a month.\n\nChoosing destinations, usually it would just depend on if I could find a good fare somewhere. I found a mistake fare to Ethiopia for $274 roundtrip, and another one to Taiwan for $100. Other times I was traveling with travel buddieWes so we would pick a region (Caucasus, West Africa) and go there.  Off season can be a good time to travel to places, cheaper and less tourists... but also some things are closed and weather isn't ideal.  Visited Iceland in April one year, Guianas in May (rainy season).\n\nThere isn't one 'correct' way to travel. Some people like to lie on a beach for a week, others (like me) prefer to zoom around and see lots of things in a short period... it's rare for me to be in a city more than 2 nights before moving on. Doing whatever you are comfortable with is OK.",

But here are a few:\n\nIn Tuvalu, was looking for somewhere to rent a motorcycle but stopped at the wrong house and started talking with the guy there.  I'd met a Norwegian dude on the flight in and he invited us to have a kava drinking and jam session later that evening.  We were only able to get one motorcycle but the guy managed to find us at the south end of the island and had ridden all the way down there to give us another scooter.  Later that night we spent 4 hrs drinking kava while he and his buddies played music.  Ow my head the next day though....\n\nAnother good experience(s) in Paraguay. I was taking photos of the slums/barrio down below the Presidential Palace.  A guy was down below playing football with his kid and we got talking (in Spanish).  Ended up spending the whole afternoon with the guy, meet his whole extended family and got a tour of the barrio including climbing down the cliffs on ladders.  Later that night he went with me to the bus station as  'there are bad people there'.   He and his wife/three kids lived in a claptrap one-room shack, a bare naked lightbulb and a tiny 5\" black and white TV.  I sent them a care package with blankets, legos, toys, etc when I got home but never heard back.   On the same Paraguay trip coming back on the bus I was sitting next to a cute young blonde woman, turns out she was a local (German descent) and spoke German, Spanish, Guarani.  So we sat chatting for a long time.\n\nIn Swaziland I was there for the Reed Festival, where 50,000+ topless girls dance for the king.  Before the dances started I was standing around the field and some younger girls came up to me and were chatting with me, they probably hadn't seen a white person up close before.  I was wearing sunglasses and they all jumped back 3 feet when I removed them... they hadn't seen blue eyes before.  Then then asked why my arms were hairy, was I some sort of monkey, lol.",

Second trip was 24 days Johannesburg loop via Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique (Several places were repeats with 1st trip).\n\nThey're a good mid-budget option.  The driver does most of the cooking though we helped out with prep.  There wasn't a separate kitty like with some other companies.",

Visited in 2003 just 15 years later and things had completely changed. Beijing was all blinged out with neon lights, massive traffic jams, high end fashion, skyscrapers, Starbucks, etc.\n\nI visited Tulum in 1999. Back then it was just simple shacks along the beach. Now there's resorts and Starbucks.\n\nMost of my travels were from the late 1990s onwards. So there were Internet cafes in places, but no wifi or cell phones.  Not much information online either other than in places like the Lonely Planet thorntree, and even that was scarce for less traveled places.  Hotels and hostels you had to show up and hope they had room.  You might send an email once a week or so.",

You have to be on a tour to get the visa, but the daily fee covers everything, the hotel, food, transport, guide, etc... so think of it more like an all-inclusive vacation.  We spent 10 days there over Christmas one year to attend one of the festivals (Trongsa).  I hadn't been to the Himalaya before so the architecture there was very unique.  They paint (quite detailed) penises on the buildings to keep away evil spirits.... The festival was very much a local affair, maybe a handful of western tourists and hundreds of locals.  The dances go on for several days with amazing costumes of skeletons, demons, lords, etc.",

Despite being one of the most foreign places I've been, in Thimphu there's still clever business names that would make westerners smile like 8 Eleven. I was lucky enough to visit as a guest of the extended royal family so my experience was local but very much the 1% if not more 0.001%. I'm curious how intrusive the tour guide experience was. Were you able to wander the city unsupervised? Did you have dining options or was everything prearranged? I would definitely love to go back and see some more of the mountain country, driving through some of the passes was spectacular.",

It's right off Route 66 so there's always international visitors as well (except during Covid..). Cadillac Ranch too. Then stop into Caprock canyons state park and say hello to the state bison herd!

On Havelock, we stayed three nights at the Barefoot Resort right behind Radhanagar Beach, which had been rated #1 beach in Asia in 2004 (visited Jan 2007). Basic but nice huts. Other than a campground it was the only place to stay on that side of the island at the time, so definitely lacked the rampant development you probably would see anywhere else in SE Asia. Certainly there were no hotel chains there back then. Looks like there is a Taj resort there now though....\n\nThe beach was great, flat, smooth clear bathtub temperature blue water and empty, though not necessarily secluded as local fishermen would walk by. Super soft white sand with ghost crabs scuttling everywhere. Turtles had come up nesting on the shore, though dogs were digging up the eggs :(\n\nDiving was... primitive. Two of the three dive shops were full the week I was there so didn't have a choice (stuff wasn't bookable online then....) The boat was one of the long local canoes (dunghi), VERY rough once out in the open water and it took us 3 hrs just to get to the dive site. Diving was good and pristine coral, though the water clarity was pretty bad. The 2nd dive was much better.\n\nSpent two nights in Port Blair for the first/last night as the flight didn't connect with the ferry, which was a floating roach motel. There are a few interesting things to see, the Circular Jail of course and the Anthropology museum, but don't have too much else to say about it.",

I've been 3 times so far, visited Istanbul, Capadoccia, Ephesus and Troy/Gallipoli.  \n\nSyria is damaged but a lot is still there... Damascus really wasn't affected by the war, Krac des Chevaliers castle is still there, (most) of Palmyra ruins are still intact, etc.  Aleppo is in bad shape though.  \n\nLebanon and Jordan were great as well.  Had some of the best hummus ever in an old school cafe in Beirut.  My route was mostly overland:  Beiruit -&gt; Baalbeck -&gt; Hama -&gt; Krac des Chevaliers -&gt; Aleppo -&gt; Palmyra -&gt; Damascus -&gt; Amman -&gt; Jerusalem -&gt; Amman -&gt; King's Highway -&gt; Petra -&gt; Wadi Rum -&gt; Amman.  Then flew to Kuwait, then to Bangladesh (was a Round-the-world ticket).\n\nEgypt has great history, but the food and people not so much.  The food mostly sucked, and got food poisoning on top of it, super hot (went in July 2003 during Iraq war), super hassle (baksheesh), dirty/polluted, etc.\n\nYeah North American countries are all fairly easy.. nothing really challenging there.  Favorites are USA, Costa Rica, Canada, Cuba.",

Djenne Mosque in Mali (missed visiting it), Gerewol festival in Niger, visiting Ennedi in Chad, Danakil in Ethiopia.  Was supposed to go on an Amazon trip this past June but that got cancelled obviously.....\n\nA lot of island nations can be limited on food options, especially in the Pacific.  I can't remember anything good about Egyptian food, /maybe/ one of the street falafel vendors.  But compared to the other country food options in the region I wasn't impressed.  Some places the food can get monotonous (Central Asia).  Best might be Turkey... I love the kebabs.  Though for high end Michelin star restaurants, France is hard to beat\n\nIn Africa, Uganda and Nigerians will talk your ear off.  They've probably been the friendliest of the bunch.\n\nSome parts of Georgia, Zambia, Malawi had horrendous roads (the potholes had potholes).. but that was ~15-20 years ago. They've probably been repaved by the Chinese by now.   Really a lot of west/central African countries don't have much in the way of tourist infrastructure... hotels are expensive for what you get.

                    "comment": "2013 trip (The Yemen one I assume) was fabulous.  Visited Sa'ana the capital and a few small towns nearby, plus the Rock Palace.  We were the first tourists in two years in one of the villages.\n\nThen flew to Socotra and spent a few days camping there before going to Ethiopia.  Fed hyenas from sticks in the old town of Harar, then went overland to Somaliland, visited the cave paintings at Las Geel and saw camels on the beach in Berbera.  The airport in Berbera had to be one of the most disorganized/chaotic ones I've been to.   \n\nFlew from there to Djibouti where we went out to Lac Assal.  The local guide we got was a hoot... 4 wives and 12 kids!  We couldn't find an open gas station so were running on fumes getting back into the city.  The old French quarter had some nice Franco-Moorish style buildings.\n\nI'd wanted to visit Eritrea on that trip but couldn't make it work out.  My travel buddy flew home from Djibouti and I continued onwards solo to Uganda.  Went white-water rafting the White Nile \nat Jinja then took an all-day bus to go do a gorilla trek in Bwindi Impenetrable Reserve.  Expensive but incredible to see the gorillas up close.  Quite a slog though! Took about 3 hrs hiking mostly steep uphill through the jungle to find the group.\n\nI'd also wanted to visit the DRC that trip but the rebel group was active still in Goma.  So I continued down to Rwanda, visited the tearjerking genocide museum and stayed at the Hotel Rwanda.\n\nAfter Rwanda I took a bus to Burundi.  Ended up getting stuck there an extra day after the airline changed the flight but didn't change my ticket.... the only time I've gotten stuck in a country. Luckily was able to get a flight out the next day.\n\nA few months later I did visit Eritrea and Saudi Arabia on a separate trip.  Only was in Jeddah but saw the old city and had Al Baik fried chicken, and metup with a Couchsurfing group there (none were Saudis).  \n\nEritrea was fascinating, an old Italian colony and Asmara has some great architecture from the 1920s.  It wasn't damaged during the independence war (I was actually there during their Independence day).  Hired a guide/driver to go to the coast at Massawa where it was stinking hot.",

Geographically of course, each of Brazil, USA, Russia, China have more diversity/size than all of the EU put together twice (Russia about 4 times).  Do you find the only thing really unique about a country is a shared level of government?  Or do you think there's something else that makes a \"country\" special?",

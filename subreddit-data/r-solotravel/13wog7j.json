Humans have a tendency to want to think \"inside the box\" and stick to plans. Free will is distressing (you could literally do anything with your life), so we tell ourselves we \"have\" to do certain things or artificially limit our options to be free.\n\nAnyways, for me, travel, the unknowns that come with it, and being exposed to new ways of doing things is very freeing, and breaks the mould on what I think I'm \"supposed\" to do with my life. You realize that you're much more capable of dealing with uncertainty and that there are many more possibilities in life than you thought.",

It's kind of reassuring to realize that. I don't know what it is but it's nice to think about the travelling one did and think about how certain things worked out and some didn't but in the end everything went off well. That's a whole new perspective in every day life to have!",

I went to a semi-rural area in Mexico and bought beer and snacks from a 15-year-old kid who had a cooler and rack on his bike. I didnt understand numbers in Spanish so I hesitantly gave him what I thought he asked and he said, \"no no papi\" and respectfully took some coins from my hand and said, \"  \ntreinta... treinta... treinta... peso\". Showing it to me making sure I understand. \n\nI was just in Japan hoping to ask for a roll of coins at a bank (for my collectible arcade machine) and thought to myself that year ago, I would probably stand outside the door having a panic attack for a good 2 hours thinking how I can do this. I simply typed on google translate and the teller said in perfect English, \"no problem! do you want it in 100 yen coins?\".\n\nRewarding moments happen all the time in solo traveling",

Traveling overseas, far from your daily grind, lets you ponder your own Big Questions with more clarity and depth. \n\nBack in 2003 I was in England, spending a few days in Brighton. I took a morning run out to Hove and back. As I jogged along I thought about my work/life. My boss was a jerk, my job was stressful. The money almost but not quite made up for it. Should I quit? I'd get no unemployment if I did. I measured this all in my head, weighing the pro's and con's. I drilled down deep and then pulled back to think about the big picture. \n\nBy the time I got back to my hotel, it was decided: I'd quit. \n\nThe rest of the trip felt like a bath of sunlight. I visited my sister, drove her family out to Stonehenge, stayed at a nice BnB, had great meals and some laughs. It was fantastic. \n\nFlew home, gave my co-workers some oversized Union Jack souvenir pens and handed in my two week notice. I was marched out the door immediately, but that's OK. I spent a few months living off savings then found another job. Because life goes on and on. You just need to push it along sometimes.",

I graduated from my biology degree, with plans to go into a master's and a lifetime of working up the ladder.. but now after travelling I think sh*t, life is SO precious and short and has the potential to be whatever I want it to be. There's so many avenues to go down, routes to explore, if it doesn't work out, who cares, try something else! (In terms of making money) I can do anything and there's SO MUCH to experience! I felt so full of beans to embrace it all and live my life for the present moment rather than slaving away to some long-term career goal. \n\nBut now that I've came home I've been struck with the harsh reality that life doesn't run on such a care-free basis where happiness is priority and just simply *living* is enough. I feel stupid for thinking that I could even feel that way and I ought to get back to my 'career-building' immediately. All my friends have gotten big jobs and relationships and mortgages and I feel like I'm so behind. Nobody understands my new outlook on life, it's not appreciated and definitely not viable in the western world. Unless you have the big job, the mortage, the car and the husband, you're seen as a failure. I feel completely and totally lost and hopeless. To know such happiness and liberation and that my life can't be that way. It's almost like a curse to have gotten this new insight on life. It almost would've been better to live in the box and not know what's outside the box but atleast you're more content that way. \n\nA very pessimistic view, but my recent experiences lately.. still trying to figure it all out. To just get on with life here and join the rat race again.. or lonesomely dive deep into the unknown with my newly found motivation for life..",

The scariest and most unbelievable thing I thought I would ever do tbh. \n\nSo, I'm going to Ireland for 4 days, I'm going to stay in Dublin and I was wondering if anyone here got any recommendations for cool little places to check out. \n\nAlready got my first and second day pretty well thought out, but i'm at an impasse for my third day.\n\nSo, for my third ay I'm a little torn up about if I should take a tour to the Cliffs of Moher from Dublin. From what I've seen, I would only get 2 hours max at the center of Galway, so the other option is that maybe I should go to Galway for 1 full day, take a tour from there to the cliffs (I guess a tour is the only way I can get there) and stay the night and leave back to Dublin next morning. Still figuring this part out now. Are the Cliffs a must see if I go to Galway or should I just fully explore the center of Galway? Day trip to Belfast would also be another option\n\nThanks for the help, don't really know what i'm doing but hey it will all work out in the end!",

            "comment": "I did a solo trip to Ireland in March, first time there. A local friend from Dublin suggested that I take the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit) train down the coast a bit to Killiney, and it was a great suggestion. Nice view of the Irish Sea, nice view after walking to the top of Killiney Hill, and I stopped in Dalkey, cute downtown, and had an Irish breakfast. It was a highlight of my Ireland trip.\n\nWith that said, 4 days is a short trip to Ireland. If only 4 days, I'd recommend spending that time around Dublin, perhaps hike in the Wicklow Mountains, and save western Ireland for another trip. You're only 19 so you have a ton of years of travel ahead of you. Just my opinion. But if you want to hit Galway and Cliffs of Moher, go for it. Galway is nice, but it has a heavily tourist feel as well while still being kind of quaint. I saw a show at a tiny club called Aras na nGael in Galway and it was a lot of fun, they only speak Gaelic/Irish there.\n\nAnd in Dublin, unless it is just your kind of thing, I'd stay out of Temple Bar. It's just such a tourist trap, full of \"kips,\" as the Dubliners say. A kip is a low-class place, like a dumb touristy \"authentic Irish pub.\"",

It's a Stone Age tomb, older than the Egyptian pyramids, that was built to be illuminated by the sunrise on the winter solstice. The tomb itself is fascinating to tour inside, and there is also a very nice museum where you can learn about the history of the site. The surrounding countryside is beautiful too, well worth the visit!\n\nTo get there, it's about an hour-long train ride from Dublin to the town of Drogheda. A bus takes tourists between Drogheda and Newgrange. Newgrange is the highlight, but you might also want to explore the town a little.\n\nWithin Dublin, my favorite was touring the Trinity College Library and seeing the Book of Kells. Dublin also has \"Hop-on, Hop-off\" buses that circulate around; it's a nice, easy way to see the city, with the option to spend more time at an interesting spot if you want to.",

I suspect though the timetables wouldn't be practical for a day trip from Dublin.\n\nIf you wanted to head more into a rural area nearer Dublin the Wicklow Mountains or around Newry (on the train line to Belfast) could be good options. Neither are particularly easy to get around on public transport but that are certainly options you can get to work - though night depend how far you are prepared to hike.\n\nWhichever you go for I hope you enjoy Ireland!",

I did a trip report that included them a while ago if you wanted to peak. was so incredible but cant go wrong with the cliffs either!",

Head a little further south for some better bars. \n\nDefinitely have the day in Galway. Salt hill is wonderful if the weather is nice too.",

The cliffs tour also included Galway and we had 2h 30min time on our own and there was not much to do honestly besides the main street. The Cliffs are must see IMO.\n\nI would recommend a daytrip to Northern Ireland also (Giants Causeway included, not just Belfast). There are several tours on getyourguide",

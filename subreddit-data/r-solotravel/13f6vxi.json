Can't comment on Zermatt so Day 7 to day 9 is sensible itinerary. \n\nI would say if possible on day 8, once you reach Bachalpsee, to continue on higher to Faulhorn where there is a Berghotel and has superb panoramic views although its currently closed and re-opens in June. Also, I would do Bachalpsee first thing in the morning as the clouds would still haven't move in until later in the day which provides amazing views of the Bernese Oberland mountains Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau. \n\nCheck the webcam at the top of First, I remember doing that while having early breakfast at my accommodation and I saw just how stunningly clear and cloudless it was, I immediately went to the First cable car station. Still in awe of the majestic views while in the cable car going up, calm blue skies with not a cloud in sight. It was around 8 am when I took the cable car. \n\nThere are other great places to visit such as Interlaken, Thun, Spiez, Lucerne all close by the Bernese Oberland region. I did 16 days (with 15 days Youth STP) through Switzerland starting from Geneva to Montreux, took the scenic Golden Pass line train to Spiez and change train to Thun, cruised on Lake Thun to Oberhofen Castle, then cruise to Spiez (Spiez castle) and train back to Thun before heading to Interlaken for the night. \n\nWith the STP, I highly recommend you take at least one lake cruise either on the lakes of Geneva, Thun, Brienz or Lucerne. I did 2 cruise on Geneva (to Chillon Castle from Montreux and from Vevey to Montreux), 1 on Thun as described above, 1 on Brienz (to Giessbach and then to Iseltwald), 1 on Lucerne (to Vitznau for the cogwheel train to Rigi and then back to Lucerne from Weggis). Definitely a highlight of the trip. Wanted to do a cruise on Zurich lake too but they said there is a 5 CHF fee even with the STP so I didn't do it plus its not as scenic compared to the others with the mountains. \n\nYes, Switzerland is expensive, but its really beautiful and its definitely worth it for a once in a lifetime experience. Travelled solo and total spend was GBP 2K, STP was definitely worth the money for me as I visited many places (museums and castles), took many cruise, trains, bus and cable cars. Not only that, with the STP, just get on the transport without needing to bother about buying a ticket. They do check tickets on most occasions. \n\nTried to stay at hostels were possible to keep cost down (on average around GBP30-35 per night with most including breakfast). Saw most tourist were older people with silver hair ( likely retired) and now having the financial means to afford an expensive place to visit.",

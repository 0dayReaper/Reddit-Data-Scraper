We have some prompts below to start things off, but will also note that we've had multiple people in the subreddit recently asking what it's like to travel in Peru right now in its current political climate, so if you have recent travel experiences there, also feel free to share. Otherwise, some more general travel questions to start off the discussion:\n\n- What were some of your favorite experiences there? \n- Experiences/perspectives on solo travel there?\n- Suggestions for food/accommodations? \n- Any tips for getting around? \n- Anything you wish you'd known before arriving?\n- Other advice, stories, experiences?\n\nArchive of previous \"weekly destination\" discussions: https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/wiki/weeklydestinations",

            "comment": "I did a 10+ day Contiki in Peru that ended a few days ago because I was worried about travelling solo so close to the protests. \n\n- Most of the main attractions are at high elevation so get some acetazolamide (altitude sickness medication) if you can - no one in our group got very sick so it definitely helps! \n\n- From what I saw, doing it through a tour company saved me a lot of headache with booking buses, trains, and tour guides through Machu Picchu - its very tightly regulated there and gets quite busy. Doing the Inca trail hike gets you a separate viewing platform for photos once you arrive in the afternoon which was a nice bonus! \n\n- Would definitely recommend having very early starts for big attractions (same as every other country) to get good pictures. \n\n- I loved Arequipa - it\u2019s not as well known as Cusco but it\u2019s an insanely charming and beautiful city and I wish I could\u2019ve spent more time there. Wasn\u2019t too impressed with Lima because it just felt like another overcrowded city. \n\n- We had private buses for the group so can\u2019t properly assess public transport, but the roads are insane so I would not drive there under any circumstances. Taxis are super cheap though! \n\n- At no stage in peru did I feel unsafe - I couldn\u2019t sense any tension in crowds, most people were just going about their daily lives. Only encountered one person trying to scam us (lady with a fake baby asking for milk powder), but everyone else seemed to just try selling trinkets and \u2018baby alpaca\u2019 knitwear. \n\n- One tip to identifying genuine baby alpaca clothing from the fakes is by squeezing it - you feel a fresh burst of slightly cool air with real alpaca, whereas the fakes/acrylic items have warmer air. \n\n\nOverall I absolutely adored Peru and hope more people visit it! Tourism is their main source of income and they deserve every boost they can get :)\n\nFeel free to ask any questions! I\u2019ll answer as best I can",

            "comment": "Came back a few weeks ago from 2 weeks solo in Peru and I can\u2019t recommend it enough and am already planning my return trip!\n\nIn terms of the political climate, I wouldn\u2019t have known anything had happened if not for prior research. I talked to some locals and tour guides about it and the general idea was that the protests have long been over and tourists were not and would not ever be in real danger if they pick back up. As long as you stay out of the way and mind your business, Peruvians truly have no interest in involving tourists in the protests. \n\nI met a friend who had traveled through Puno/Lake Titicaca from Bolivia where supposedly the protests have continued more recently, and he said there was no danger, only a severe lack of population and a lot of business closures. \n\n* My favorite experience - From Cusco, I went to the cultural zone of Manu National Park and hiked the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. These were both life changing experiences, but I am still surprised at how much I loved the rainforest. I spent about a week there and I\u2019d recommend the rainforest to anyone going to Peru, either Manu or the actual Amazonias further north. I think it often gets overshadowed by Machu Picchu (fair) but it can\u2019t be missed in my opinion. I hate bugs, the heat/humidity, and being dirty and I still found the rainforest to be the highlight of my trip so that should tell you something!\n\n* Lima: Didn\u2019t love it, I wouldn\u2019t spend more than a day there tbh. I would go back though solely for the ceviche. It\u2019s fantastic everywhere in Peru (obviously) but unmatched in Lima (tbh I\u2019d expect this to be true of all the coast cities but Lima is the only one I hit this time). The Malecon/Parque del Amor/view of the coast is beautiful, but otherwise it was just a big crowded city. Miraflores and Barranco are the most popular neighborhoods and were very safe as long as you have common sense haha\n\n* Arequipa: It was a beautiful city because of all of the ash white buildings and was the perfect opposite from the crowds of Lima. I stayed in one of the nicest private ensuite hostel rooms I\u2019ve ever seen for $20 USD and the food was all absolutely incredible. Don\u2019t skip this one, especially if you\u2019re going to Cusco imo, because the altitude is ~8k ft/2500m vs Lima\u2019s sea level altitude and I think being in Arequipa first helped me adjust to Cusco. I had zero altitude sickness in Cusco, but had acetazolamide that I got OTC in Lima just in case. I didn\u2019t plan enough in advance this time, but on previous high altitude hikes I have taken the prescription steroid Decadron and I much prefer it to Diamox. (It is a steroid so does have side effects so please consult your doctor before taking as I am not one) \n\n* Solo travel: I am a relatively small young woman and I never felt unsafe. I walked everywhere besides Ubers to/from airports, including at night, and was totally fine. My wallet and phone were always either zipped into my pockets or chained to my belt loops, and I rarely took my phone out in public (used voice directions in my airpods). I used a 20L daypack that doesn\u2019t have zippers accessible from the back, and that security felt like overkill as I rarely found myself in crowds because of how empty Peru is right now. Always stepped into a restaurant/store to check my maps if needed and walked with a purpose at all times to not look lost. These feel like common sense things to me in any country but I do feel the need to mention it. Lima felt like an objectively dangerous city and I was more on edge there, but never *unsafe*. Arequipa and Cusco couldn\u2019t have been safer imo. Peruvians are always out late at night and outside of Lima, the heavy population made it feel a lot more safe to me.\n\nFood recs: \n* Lima - Mango\u2019s at Larcomar, Punto Azul and La Lucha in Miraflores, Manolo by Parque Kennedy (best churros ever)\n* Arequipa - Dima\u2019s, Picanter\u00eda Victoria, 13 Monjas\n* Cusco - Chicha por Gaston (my fanciest meal), El Macchiato, La Cantina Italiana\n\nAccommodations recs:\n* Arequipa - Flying Dog Hostel\n* Cusco - Viajero Kokopelli (it\u2019s one of the more expensive hostels in the city but it\u2019s worth it imo)\n\n*Getting around: I walked everywhere. Peru is incredibly walkable and always populated. The tours I did from Cusco all provided necessary transportation and I took ubers to/from the airport. There are a ton of taxis readily available but I personally preferred uber from a cost/safety standpoint as a solo woman. \n\nGeneral advice/thoughts: \n\n* You should speak some Spanish imo, even if it\u2019s just basic. You can *mostly* get by without it in Cusco but outside of that, it would be difficult if you didn\u2019t speak the language. Even the post office I went to in Cusco didn\u2019t have any english speakers working and I had to translate for a couple of americans. It\u2019s just\u2026SO much easier to communicate when you know even just some basics. Peru is a very easy country for beginner speakers too, their dialect is quite understandable and slow compared to other Spanish-speaking countries, so if you want to practice, Peru\u2019s the place. I\u2019m not fluent only proficient, and I never struggled outside of speaking to some Argentinians in my tour group lol. \n\n* I\u2019ve seen some people saying to book your tours when you get there for better prices, and while I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true especially with how dead tourism is right now, I booked all of mine ahead of time and was very satisfied with the price for value on them. I also am sooo thankful for the peace of mind knowing nothing would sell out and that I didn\u2019t subject myself to choosing one of what felt like hundreds of tours being advertised on the street. Especially in Cusco you will be haggled by people *constantly* for tours and massages - if I acknowledged them it was just to say \u201cya tengo\u201d because they could be quite pushy at times. For that reason, I\u2019m glad I booked ahead of time and would recommend this especially when tourism eventually picks back up and availability decreases. I heavily recommend Alpaca Tours and Palotoa Travel. \n\n* You can barter with the people selling trinkets and things but as an american with a decent salary it felt\u2026icky. If I felt the price was way too high I usually just moved on to find it elsewhere because in the cities that exact thing was guaranteed to be down the street/a couple stalls down for a cheaper price. I watched some american guys that I knew were successful business owners haggle a woman down on a blanket for what amounted to a $10USD difference and it was disappointing to see tbh, especially knowing that it made way more of a difference for her. Not saying you shouldn\u2019t ever barter, sometimes the prices are unreasonable, but outside of the main cities in more rural areas where people make very little money on the day to day and aren\u2019t selling the typical tourist shit, I would just caution people to be more sensitive and maybe suck it up assuming you have the budget. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions if you have them!! Sorry this is so long, but I tried to be as thorough as possible because I know how much these responses helped me when I was planning. Go to Peru!! They would heavily appreciate your tourism :)",

            "comment": "I spent two weeks in Peru in 2014 and absolutely loved it. I was in South America for five weeks in total and Peru was definitely my favourite country. \n\nHighlights include:\n\n* The four-day Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. I'm a generally not very fit person and it was definitely the most challenging thing I have done but so worth it. I had spent five days in La Paz, Bolivia acclimatising to the altitude and had no issues.\n* The train from Puno to Cusco (can be done in reverse as well). The trip included entertainment and morning tea, lunch, and afternoon tea. The train also stops at the highest point of the trip and you're allowed out to have a quick look.\n* Lake Titicaca and the floating islands. I had made my way from La Paz to Puno by way of a tour that took me to Isla del Sol on the Bolivian side of Lake Titicaca. I spent one full day in Puno, which was taken up with a tour out to Tacquile Island and then across to a local farm for a traditional style meal before finishing with a visit to Uros and the floating islands.\n* Trujillo and the ancient city of Chan-Chan. This was interesting and also included a tour to Huaca de la Luna in the morning and a quick visit to Huanchaco after the Chan-Chan tour.\n\nI probably spent one day too long in Lima but it was at the very end of my time in Peru and I used it partly to rest up before the next leg of my trip. As a solo female traveller at no time did I feel unsafe. A lot of what I did was joining day tours to destinations, which means I got to meet some people as well. \n\nI took about six months of basic Spanish lessons before I headed to South America and although I'm not great I was still able to make myself understood, which was appreciated (I was so pleased with myself when the taxi I ordered in Cusco actually turned up on time the next morning).",

            "comment": "* Going to one of the best restaurants in the world (Maido) for prices you can't get in Europe. More expensive then the average there sure, but also a once in a lifetime experience. \n\n* Solo is easy. there's a lot of services to help it like peruhop and free walking tours\n\n* Maido, see above. Had some great mystery meat from a guy barbecuing on the beach of Paracas. Don't eat at the main square of Cusco, I got food poisoning there (and its all mediocre and overpriced). Do have llama, its great. Guinea Pig is only worth it for the experience, I had a whole one and it didn't taste great. Tough to eat too. As for hostels, the owner of  Hospedaje Turistico Recoleta was very nice and they offer a lot of tours. A bit away from the tourist centre tho and not great for socializing if you care about that. For Paracas I didn't bother with the Peruhop advised hostel and went to Atenas Backpacker Hospedaje, which had a private room that was better and cheaper then their offer. Everything there is on the same street so it's not like it matters. Other places no noteworthy recs for staying.\n\n* Peruhop is easy, but if I went again I'd just book buses locally. Those are more luxurious and cheaper. The staff of Peruhop was very nice and helpful though.\n\n* Public transport is easy despite what you see online. Stay shorter in Lima, its boring.\n\n* I spend 4 nights in Lima (and a night on the way back, but I had food poisoning then so it's all a blur). Way more then you need. Do the city centre tour for a day, eat some place nice and get out. Barranco is a tourist trap. The various museums are nothing special. You do not need more time there. Paracas can be done in a day (arrive day 1 late, do the tour next morning and leave). Huacachina was nicer then I thought it would be despite being a tourist trap, but also doesn't need much time. A night is enough. Arequipa is lovely. The town itself can be done in 1.5 days,  maybe a bit more if you love religion, but it has good food, nice people and you can use it as a base for various tours. I was in Cusco for a week, there is not enough for a week there, and my wanderings got me food poisoning so I didn't enjoy the Macchu Picchu hike afterwards at all. Stay shorter, do the daytrips, don't eat at the square! Sacred Valley day trip is worth it, Salt Mine not, Pisac is, Rainbow Mountain is (but its not as colourful as in the pictures). Research which ATM's to use. My cards didn't work at a bunch, and others had rip off prices. Inside a bank was most reliable in my experience.",

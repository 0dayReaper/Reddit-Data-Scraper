    "postText": "I just came back from 2 weeks in San Francisco (23M from Europe). Here\u2019s a summary of my trip. \n\nWhat I liked:\n\n* The diversity of neighborhoods and foods\n* All the parks! Especially Golden Gate Park. So peaceful. \n* The museums, particularly SFMOMA and De Young (the Ansel Adams photography exhibition was amazing)\n* The cafes. I drank some of the best coffee of my life in SF. \n* The nightlife: very alive city, great bars\n* The bookstores and public librairies \n* Renting a bike and explore the city: a great way to cover more miles! Wasn\u2019t ready for the hills though lol\n* The views: all around town, you can find amazing views of the city or the bay, it\u2019s incredibly beautiful. The GG bridge and Baker Beach too. \n* I went to a baseball game at Oracle Park and it was awesome!\n* Went on a day-trip to Yosemite NP: long day but totally worth it, it was stunning. \n* I was satisfied with the MUNI transportation system \n* The hostel was great (Green Tortoise in North Beach), perfect location, friendly people\n* Globally, the \u00ab\u00a0slow\u00a0pace \u00bb of the city was what I needed: I didn\u2019t feel overwhelmed at any point of the trip. \n\nWhat I disliked:\n\n* The insecurity. I didn\u2019t feel safe in some areas (SoMA, Union Square, Tenderloin\u2026). When I took the BART from the airport, a group of teenagers were harassing people, screaming, degrading stuff and smoking drugs. Made me really scared so I looked at my feet the whole time. Wasn\u2019t pleasant at all. \n* The number of addicts on the streets very saddened me. I never saw this level of drug abuse in my life. It was devastating to see so many people suffering from this crisis. I saw a man having some kind of psychotic episode right in front of me, or a seizure idk\u2026 it was scary. I hope they will get the help they need. \n* The prices: everything was SO expensive. $45 to enter the Academy of Science? I mean, come on. Food, too. \n* The weather: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s unusual or not but it was freaking COLD! Going to California I thought it would be sunny and warm, but not at all. A lot of wind too. A lot of the time, it wasn\u2019t very pleasant being outside. That sucked. \n\nOverall, 2 weeks in the city was too much. 8-9 days would have been plenty enough to explore, but this extra time also allowed me a lot of reading/reflecting time, which was what I wanted. I just wish I booked 4-5 days in another city, I was getting a bit bored at the end. Or I should\u2019ve rented a car, but was too anxious to drive alone or to have it vandalized. \n\nAlso, 2 weeks in a room with 10 other people and shared bathrooms was a lot to handle for me. I wish I booked 3-4 nights at a hotel to have a little privacy and recharge my social batteries. \n\nA lot of lessons learned from this first trip! I\u2019m so happy that I did it, because I know all these mistakes will only make my future trips better. Overall, it was a really cool experience. I can\u2019t wait to go again!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m glad you had a good trip overall! To have a European rate MUNI positively is impressive lol. \n\nI\u2019ve grown up near the city and it\u2019s changed a lot in the last few years so the negatives you mentioned don\u2019t surprise me. We\u2019ve had a super high cost of living, a huge shift downtown due to remote workers commuting less, and lots of big stores leaving downtown. I warn a lot of people who ask me about visiting in the hopes they are less shocked when they arrive. You were smart not to rent a car! I\u2019ve heard some residents deal with multiple break ins a year. \n\nSF has micro climates and is cool most of the year so I always feel a little bad for visitors showing up here expecting that California sunshine! The Bay Area and the city itself can have multiple micro climates so even going from 1 side of the city to the other can mean the weather shifts a lot - that\u2019s why we always say to dress in layers! \n\nAfter getting your full of SF I would\u2019ve recommended venturing out to Berkeley (accessible by BART) or perhaps arranging a day trip to Sausalito, Santa Cruz, Napa, or Sonoma. Still, I\u2019m glad you gave us a try!",

I went to Yosemite area and stayed for 3.5 days, and then stayed in Pacifica which is a bit south of SF for 3.5 days. I wish I had a bit more time in both, tbh, like I wish I would've done like a 12 day trip? I felt like I got to do a lot, but I didn't get to just chill out and relax as much as I wanted.\n\nNear Yosemite, I had a day where I checked out the local area (near North Fork/Oakhurst), the next day I did a longer hike at the San Joaquin river, and then I did a day at Yosemite. The next day was a driving day, then I hung out in Pacifica for the evening and watched the sunset. I then did a road trip to Big Sur and stopped along Highway 1 and saw some sites and cities. Stopped in Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz, met up with an old friend in Santa Cruz. Then the next day I went to the Golden Gate Bridge and to Muir Woods and saw the redwoods. Then I went into the city on my last day and used MUNI! It was a great trip. I definitely was happy I rented a car.",

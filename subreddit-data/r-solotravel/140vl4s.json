    "postText": "American here (31M, Los Angeles). Just got back from a 2.5-week solo trip to Germany. This was my first visit there, so I wanted to share my experience.\n\nI stayed in the following cities:\n\n* **Frankfurt** \\- Amazing skyline, loved viewing it from green spaces throughout the city. The Messeturm, Commerzbank, and St. Bartholomew's Cathedral were my favorite sights.\n* **T\u00fcbingen** \\- Beautiful, brightly-colored medieval buildings. Surprising amount of graffiti, which seemed to clash with the character of the city. But the Neckar Riverfront is lovely to walk along. \n* **Munich** \\- Gorgeous city. Lively, yet well-kept. I was in a good mood the whole time here. The Residenz Palace and Theatine Church are incredible.\n* **Nuremberg** \\- Absolutely fascinating place. Well-preserved old town and excellent museums (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nazi Documentation Center, Nuremberg Trials Memoriam).\n* **Dresden** \\- The most elegant city. Truly breathtaking architecture (Frauenkirche, Royal Palace, Academy of Fine Arts, etc.). Especially impressive so much of it was rebuilt after WWII destruction.\n* **Berlin** \\- So unique with so much to enjoy. Reichstag, Fernsehturm, Museum Island (Pergamon and Neues), Charlottenburg, the Wall memorials, East Side Gallery, etc. I can see why Berlin is so beloved.\n\nI also took day trips to the following places:\n\n* **Mainz** \\- Very charming and relaxing break from the bigger cities. So many pretty churches, especially the Mainzer Dom, the Christuskirche, and St. Peter's.\n* **Hohenzollern Castle** \\- Delightful, really cool variety of turrets and towers. Great brown and blue-gray exterior, and more attractive interior than expected.\n* **Neuschwanstein Castle** \\- A dream. The castle has a great design, and the setting in the Bavarian Alps is spectacular. The interior was surprising, but a fun look into the mind of Ludwig II.\n\nSome general thoughts:\n\n* German people are very friendly, about equal to the French in my experience (I visited France last year). Germans' energy feel more similar to Americans than the French, however. \n* English is not as widely spoken as expected. This was generally a non-issue, as most people were helpful and willing to try their best English when I struggled with my German. Younger Germans seem more confident with their English than older Germans do.\n* Despite the above, 93% of music played in public was English-language (Lady Gaga, The Offspring, R.E.M., etc.).\n* German food is very good, if a bit repetitive (so much pork and potatoes!). The Franconian sausage is my favorite main dish, and the Mandelrolle is my favorite pastry.\n* German beer is great too. Augustiner Edelstoff is my favorite. Ayinger Br\u00e4uweisse and Augustiner Lagerbier Hell are also good.\n* Public transport in every city is fantastic! Rules are a bit inconsistent and confusing though. Example: In Munich, a ticket I bought for the U-Bahn in the city center required validation, but a ticket I bought for the S-Bahn at Leuchtenbergring station was too big for the validation machine. The latter ticket didn't require validation, but I didn't know that until I asked a German for help.\n* Deutsche Bahn train system between cities is generally good, but more delays than I expected.\n* Despite May temperatures in Germany being roughly the same as France last October, German apartments get much warmer at night.\n* If Germany doesn't do air conditioning and you're expected to keep windows open, why no screens to keep out bugs? So many mosquitos, moths, and gnats...\n* Smoking shockingly common, especially among young people.\n* I respect the frequent bike usage and got used to the bike lanes. But bikes zooming through public squares and such made me jump several times.\n* I have never seen more construction in my life.\n* As a gay guy, Frankfurt and Berlin have the hottest men. Dresden's pretty good too.\n* Germany is a verdant and beautiful country. Loved the mountains and farms of Bavaria, the hills of Saxony, the castles along the Rhine Valley, and the copious amount of parks and green space.\n\nOverall, I had a great trip! Very glad I got to explore Germany and would love to see more of it (Hamburg, Heidelberg, Cologne, etc.). Thank you for making an American feel welcome!",

Buses, subways and trains everywhere. But man, there will be delays depending which routes you take. Usually it\u2019s the most frequented trains that come with delays, mostly in bigger cities. Deutsche Bahn is a construction hell, but most of the time, there will be alternative routes/schedules. Good luck on getting around!",

Flixbus is 5:10 hours, for 30\u20ac. The bus is transported by the ferry from Denmark to Germany, so you don't have to deal with changing rides, it was like an hour or so (maybe even less). But you can get off the bus when you're on the ferry and shop or eat something etc. The driver will tell you a time when to get back to the bus. Hope that helps!",

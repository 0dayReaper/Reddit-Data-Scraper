Cut Hong Kong to 3 days and give the extra time to Hanoi, or Phong Nha (if you can ride a motorbike).  \n\nIf you can ride, rent a good motorcycle in Phong Nha and ride a 2 day out and back to Khe Sanh along the Laos border.  If you want a shorter ride, do an out and back to Long Son and stay at the Duc Tuan Hotel (confirm that it is still in business).\n\nCheck out the Vietnam Coracle website for more info on this ride.  It is \"ROUTE 4: Ho Chi Minh West is Best Loop (290km)\" out of Phong Nha.",

Come to think of it, I hired scooters in several cities in Vietnam with no bike licence or international permit (and Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Turkey, and Italy). \n\nThe law might've changed since then, although the most recent was Thailand in 2020 and I had no problem hiring scooters there. I did get fined on Phuket for not wearing a helmet, but that was only in the really touristy areas (for their 'tea money') - outside of those the police weren't interested at all.",

            "comment": "I have some biases as I spent a lot of time in Hong Kong and might be desensitized to it's wonders. I would personally take some days out of Hong Kong and into Hanoi especially if you plan on doing Ha Long, Sapa and Ninh Binh. That's a lot of day trips and you would be knackered by the time you get to Hong Kong. Also since your interests are more being around nature and hiking, I think 3-4 days gives you a good taster based on your time frame. It gives you one day to do one of the hikes like to Dragon's Back or to Stanley and gives you a day to visit one of the islands like Cheung Chau so you have your taste of nature. And then for the remaining one to two days to visit the city itself. The food in Vietnam is also very delicious so you won't feel like you are missing out.",

For the last day I was there I decided that even though my $100 tour fee was non-refundable and even though I really wanted to see where we were going, if I had to do another 7am start and in the rain I would just be miserable.

For me personally I would either spend less time in European cities and spend it more on the coast like in Italy or around The Greek islands. \n\nIf I did city's only I would say 1 and a half months if I did more time on the coast I would suggest 2 months would be pretty ideal. \n\nIn my opinion some European cities are kinda boring and there isn't heaps to do, I had a lot of free time because I overestimated what there is to do. I love people watching when I'm in Asia because the culture is so different and people act differently then western cultures. Here alot of things are the same to Aus or the same as one another (depending on where you are) so it kinda kills the vibe a bit.\n\nIt's also quite expensive in some places so budget may also be considered if you're staying for 2 months or longer :)",

Pretty hard to save any decent money as a single person with rent prices where they are these days.\n\nIf we wanted a big $$ blowout vacation we wouldn\u2019t be coming here for advice.\n\nThat advice is fine in Life magazine, but it\u2019s not realistic for the majority of users here.",

    "postText": "Hi there, I've recently been planning my (m20s) first solo-trip abroad to the aforementioned region in late August (mostly due to the cheap Bordeaux flight prices from my region, a few recommendations I've received, and for the desire to travel to one of my bucket-list destinations - San Sebastian).\n\nMy current itinerary involves flying into Bordeaux in the late evening on the 22nd, spending 3 full days there including a trip to Saint-Emilion, and then travelling by train to San Sebastian on day 4 (26th - not sure if early or late) and spending another 3 full days there (27th to the 29th) before getting the train back to Bordeaux on the 30th for a late evening flight home.\n\nI'm a fairly active holidayer and enjoy experiencing everything a region has to offer in terms of sightseeing, therefore lying on the beach isn't exactly how I'd envision a perfect use of my time, so I'm wondering will there be enough in both Bordeaux and San Sebastian to keep me engaged for that length of trip? (I don't mind taking things at a slow pace and consuming all the pintxos and txakoli that I can in San Sebastian as I wander about, since I know that's the main appeal, just as long as there's fresh scenery to go with it!).\n\nAre there other areas in the region that are more/equally worth seeing that I could fit into my schedule? (Biarritz/Pamplona/Bilbao). I'm not opposed to either adding or subtracting a day or two to the overall length of trip in order to have the best experience. Thanks :)",

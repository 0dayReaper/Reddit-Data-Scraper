    "postText": "I'm a big middle-aged guy. Like, I started at 400 lbs last summer. I decided that I needed goals and motivators that were not food! So, I've been planning trips to help with motivation.\n\nAt 375 lbs, I gave myself a weekend in Montreal (a drive from Boston). \n\nAt 335 lbs, I got a winter week-long trip to the Caribbean. This was a solo trip that I'll always remember. I'll try to post pictures when I get a chance.\n\nI'm starting to think about a trip to Germany for 300 lbs. I figure it will involve more walking. I'm aiming for July.\n\nI don't want to plan ahead of that so I have goals that I make sure I can meet. The final trip will hopefully be to walk Hadrian's Wall in the UK.\n\nHas anyone else used travel as a reward and motivator like this?",

Travel was my motivation to have the procedure in the first place as I like to get about when I can (visited 17 countries in 2022!). \n\nHowever, my previous trips in 2021/early 2022 had been marred by terrible back pain, which made walking (even a short distance) very painful - it was so debilitating. How on earth can you wander around sightseeing when you can\u2019t walk more than 2 mins at a time? I was due to go on a big adventure to SE Asia in the autumn that would have been miserable had I not gone ahead with the sleeve. When the time came around, I was 3 months PO, and already I didn\u2019t need an extender, I sat in the middle seat on an internal flight, and was able to take part in all the activities with zero pain. \n\nThis procedure has given me my life back - I\u2019m over 105lbs down (probably another 60-70 to go) and no longer do I get anxious about all of those things us overweight people typically worry about (\u201cwill I fit?\u201d, \u201cwill that break?\u201d, \u201chow far is that walk?\u201d, \u201cwhat do I wear?\u201d etc). \n\nI\u2019m so glad to hear you\u2019re doing so well :)",

Now I'm definitely going to consider travel as a reward because I just started my journey to lose weight, and I believe it can motivate me even more than just my body. I've already started running in the mornings, and [Step App](https://twitter.com/StepApp_/status/1649413833746784261?s=20) helps me a lot with pushing myself, but now I understand that it can be a great way to combine financial rewards with incredible feelings and emotions from travelling, so thanks for the tip!",

I walk maybe 5 miles per day and still eat anything I want and still loose the weight. Im not an expert with this so I can be wrong but I thought I share my experience. I left for a month one time and lost 10 pounds",

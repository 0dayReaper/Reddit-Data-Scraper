    "postText": "Hello, \n\n  \nIf I plan to travel from Europe to South America, Bolivia, but the first flight goes through Brazil then is it necessary to have a transit visa since to enter Brazil a visa is required? I would only be in the airport of Sao Paulo where I have a connecting flight to Santa Cruz, Bolivia.  \nAlso, do I need a yellow fever vaccination for a transit country, as it is required in Brazil but not in the region of Bolivia where I am heading to?  \nDoes anyone know and reliable site to check for C19 requirements since Lufthansa made it seem like there are requirements but other place claimed that there are none.\n\n  \nThank you very much for your time and have an amazing day.",

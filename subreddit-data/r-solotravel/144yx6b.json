    "postText": "Been a huge thing on my mind - I have always wanted to go to Brazil but have never had the chance and other trips have come up in the way. Based in San Francisco so it's also quite far. I've booked a flight to Costa Rica where I planned to spend the full 20 days before having to go back to the US for a wedding. Now that I'm thinking about it though, I could fly from Costa Rica and kill 2 birds with one stone.\n\nIssue is: Working 9-5ish every day so will not be traveling or exploring too much during the day. Normally 10 days is quite a bit of time but with work, I'll likely have a few hours in the morning to run around and surf, then work, then get dinner/go out if lucky. So long excursions only happen Fri-Sunday. If you were me would you stick in Costa Rica for 20 days or add Rio to it? Also open a different mix of time spent (ie 13 days costa rica, 7 days rio). Rio just seems amazing, really want to go but also dont want to show up for 6 days, work most of it and then not see much.\n\nReally torn on this one! LMK",

(Also, as someone else mentioned, it gets dark here around 530pm. Earlier with the rain.)\n\n2) power can be iffy in the rain. Get a UPS for your cable modem and wifi router if you need to be on zoom calls non-stop. \n\n3) SJO doesn\u2019t have the best connections so I\u2019m guessing getting from Costa Rica to Brazil is going to take some time with a layover in Colombia or Panama?",

I expect that it\u2019s a long flight though, but you\u2019ll find plenty to do during your down time in Rio. The natural beauty around /within the city is amazing. Just stay somewhere near the things you want to do (I stayed in Ipanema, good spot if you like the beach).\n\nTime zone is 4 hours ahead of SF so you would have the mornings free. But also means you\u2019re working later into the evening. You can find nice cafes to work from. I went in the summer so now sure how it is now, but weather in the mornings was perfect.",

Especially when you throw in that the popular places to visit in CR are far from the airport and take hours to reach by car\u2014 you\u2019d burn an entire day on travel alone between the two.",

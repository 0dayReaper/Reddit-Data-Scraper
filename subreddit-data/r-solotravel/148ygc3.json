    "postText": "I (33M) will traveling to CDMX in August for about a week. I'm from the US and it'll be my first time traveling to Mexico. I'm big into history and culture and I'm also excited to eat amazing Mexican food!\n\nBesides everything within the city, the main day trips I'd like to do are:\n\nTeotihuacan - (possibly do the balloon ride)  \nTepoztlan - I've read there's an awesome hike to the summit of an Aztec pyramid with amazing views\n\nMy initial plan was to book a hotel but when I spoke to a friend who had visited already about my trip, he suggested I stay in a hostel so that I'd be able do the day trips as part of a group and save money. He also said that if I were to do these privately, they would end up costing way more and that a lot of them are scams where they just take you and drop you off..\n\nAre Teotihuacan and Tepoztlan easy to do solo? Do you have any recommendations of reputable tour guides? I've only seen the ones on Viator so far. I'm also assuming some of the major hotels would partner with quality tour companies as well??\n\nThanks for your help!",

Also just be aware last year the temple at top was closed but you could hike up for the views. So just verify if it\u2019s open again",

I did it solo using [this company](https://volare.com.mx/en/shared-balloon-flight/) and it was a very easy experience. i took an uber there and used their transport to get back, you could also use their transport both ways.",

If you\u2019re there on a Sunday I would highly recommend renting a city bike and biking all along Reforma road. The best neighborhoods were Condesa and Roma Norte. My favorite bar Gin Gin is those neighborhoods. Oh man, if you can catch a luchador wrestling show you absolutely should\n\nI really loved Mexico City, have a great time!",

    "postText": "So I'm meeting a friend for a cruise out of Southampton later this month, and I thought I would spend a few days in Ireland before the cruise.\n\n Had everything booked (car, 2 nights in an AirBnB in Northern Ireland overlooking the ocean, 1 night outside of Dublin before flying onward). \n\nNow I am second guessing EVERYTHING.... Worried about driving on the left without a navigator (have driven on the left before, for about a month), worried about enjoying my hike if  the wind is blowing hard (or being blown off a cliff, not really,  but kinda). But mostly, I think I'm trying to fit too much into the trip because it's only Tuesday morning through Friday afternoon. \nNorthern Ireland is one of my favorite places in the world and I don't think this short trip will do it justice, or justify the price, if I'm honest.\n\nSo, today, I thought maybe I could just head to London early instead of doing Ireland -  just have one place to stay and see more of one place that racing around the The Republic and NI. \nI'm an introvert, so an Air BnB on the moody coast is a dream come true, but I'm also at home in a city, especially because it's easy to loose yourself in one.\n\nHoping for advice! Also, my first time asking anything on Reddit, so go easy! \n\nTL:DR Go to Ireland for 3 days -rent a car,  visit Belfast, Giant's Causeway, Bushmills, Newgrange, turn in car, hit Dublin for a few hours, fly to Southampton. OR:\n\nLondon: see Les Mis, HOPO bus, maybe a trip to Cotswolds\n\nSorry for the novel....",

I am leaning more towards London, just think I've built up this Ireland trip in my head too much,  because I've wanted thie trip for so long (well, a much longer, less rushed trip, that is).\n\nFor more background, I spent 10 days in Ireland a few years back, and this was a trip planned for 2020 that was obviously cancelled, and just now getting back to it. \n\nPlanned the cruise with a friend because if she backed out, which has happened before, because life.... I'd feel comfortable to cruise alone. But she is coming, and now I wish we were tooling around the countryside on our own. But so excited for the trip regardless, nice to travel solo and do exactly what I want (as soon as I figure out what that is), and then it will be nice to have my friend along for the 2nd leg of the trip.",

            "comment": "Ireland is arguably the better of the two options, but you'll be really tight for time to get all those things in. If you're already open to changing up the itinerary a tiny bit, then the goals you laid out might be manageable but require skipping Giant's Causeway and doing something else instead unless you don't mind doing a lot of driving.\n\nIf I can be so bold to make these suggestions:\n\nDay 1:\nDrive straight down to Newgrange after you arrive in Belfast. It's about 90 minutes and not too tricky of a drive. Spend 2-3hrs there and then head towards Dublin. See if you can arrange an Airbnb in Howth or a bit further south in Wicklow. I think those two places would hit the \"cottage on a moody coast\" vibe you'd be looking for up near Giants Causeway. Explore the local surroundings with the rest of your day. This is a pretty light day aside from the driving, but it's a beautiful drive.\n\nDay 2:\n\nI'll lay out three options here- one is more active than the others, one will require more driving, and the third is a lovely day in Dublin.\n\nOption 1: Head to Glendalough in Co. Wicklow. This is a nearly 1,000 year old monastic city nestled in a mountain valley at the mouth of a lake. The city itself is beautiful and like something out of a fairytale, but for the most immersive experience, I suggest going for a hill walk around the region. This takes a few hours and depends on your physical abilities. The Spinc is my favorite, but it's also the most challenging of the options. Although, once you get up the initial incline (assuming you're hiking clockwise) it becomes much more easy. There are extraordinary views of the monastic city, herds of wild red deer grazing on the mountainsides, and far fewer tourists than Giants Causeway which could make your introvert side happy if it's anything like mine. Follow the hike (about 3-4hrs total) with a visit to Glendalough Whiskey distillery to supplement Bushmills (if you meant the distillery and not just the town) and The Wicklow Heather restaurant for a great meal (they usually offer Glendalough Whiskey flights and samplers too if you just want to try a few local spirits). Return to your Airbnb and maybe read a book near the ocean.\n\nOption 2: Drive south to Wexford and wander the city streets, enjoy the local cafes, maybe take the ferry to the Saltee Islands which have great walks, modest sea cliffs, and copious wildlife including puffins and other seabirds dependent on the season. If you're a foodie at all, then definitely check out the handful of local spots that Michelin has granted \"Bib Gourmand\" ratings to (https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/wexford/restaurants). These are often more affordable than Michelin starred restaurants, but still offer well above average quality food.\n\nOption 3: If you're staying in Howth, you can take the train into Dublin. If you're staying in Wicklow then the bus can take you in, but driving and parking is always an option (though it can be a bit more stressful). Anyway, get into Dublin City as early in the day as you can. There are plenty of museums and points of interest (the National Museum Of Ireland offers free entry to their locations, but the Archeology museum is my personal favorite https://www.museum.ie/en-ie/home) including Trinity College where The Books Of Kells is kept, the Guinness Storehouse, and the Jameson Distillery. Temple Bar is always very touristy, but can be fun to take a quick walk through. Saint Stephen's Green is smaller than you might expect, but worth taking a stroll if you enjoy city parks. I also recommend Grafton Street for a taste of the local busking scene and some nice shops and pubs. This area is all incredibly walkable and is a great way to spend the day if you enjoy people watching.\n\nDay 3: If you haven't spent time in Dublin by now, then absolutely do so before you need to catch your flight and check out some of the spots in Option 3 above. Otherwise, just enjoy a lazy day soaking in the vibe of the area.\n\nAlternatively, here is a complete whirlwind itinerary that requires lots of driving but will catch Giant's Causeway as well as a few other essential stops for the melancholy introvert:\n\nDay 1: Arrive in Belfast in AM and drive directly to Giant's Causeway. Take your tour and then drive to Carrick, Co. Donegal. Visit Sliabh Liag (aka. Slieve League) sea cliffs- the tallest in all of Europe, just in time for sunset (a taste of what that's like: https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRKeJHoL/). Stay in Carrick or other nearby Airbnb for the night.\n\nDay 2: Drive to Newgrange (\u22484hrs) and also check out Knowth and Dowth while you're there. Bonus points is to stop off in Cavan for tea. Not much happening in Cavan, but it's exciting enough for a midmorning cuppa or an early luncheon. Plus all the Irish you talk to at the pub in Dublin will either scratch their heads about why you stopped there or be overjoyed that you paid attention to their little slice of the countryside. Anyway, after Newgrange, you'll be pretty exhausted so head to your Dublin area Airbnb for an easy evening.\n\nDay 3: Visit one of the free museums in Dublin City and get to the airport enough in advance to make sure you're not totally stressed.\n\nOf course all of this only works if you're flying into Belfast fairly early in the morning and then flying out of Dublin.\n\nWhichever way you go (Ireland or London) have fun, be safe, and make sure your prioritizing things that will make you happy. Happy Solo traveling!",

This time, it's a 10 hour time difference from Alaska, and that is probably my main safety concern with driving. The other is not having a navigator, and getting lost will stress me out/not be as fun. \n\nI could easily spend 2-3 days in Belfast, or Dublin, but my favorite part of Ireland is beyond the cities....and definitely needs more time than I can give it. But my trip was booked on miles, so I'm locked into some arbitrary dates I picked 10 months ago.\n\nThank you again for the advice!",

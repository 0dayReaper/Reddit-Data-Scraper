    "postText": "Here's my tentative itinerary. Nothing, other than the flight to and from Turkey has been finalized, so I'm open to suggestions. I don't have much planned in Istanbul yet, but I know that's where I'd like to spend a majority of my trip.\n\nDay 1: Arrive in Izmir at 3pm - Spend rest of the day exploring the city, walking around. I plan to stay in Alsancak.\n\nDay 2: Head out to Ephesus.\n\nDay 3: Probably take a walking tour of the city. Not sure how to fill this day. I want to take an 11pm bus to Goreme.\n\nDay 4: Reach Goreme around 10:15, walk around the town, a bit, maybe rent a motorcycle and explore. Book a sunset tour.\n\nDay 5: Balloon flight followed by the green tour. \n\nDay 6: I'm thinking of booking a flight later in the afternoon in case my balloon flight gets postponed. If my balloon flight doesn't get rescheduled from the previous day, and I have time in the morning, this will be a lazy morning before flying to Istanbul. I'm planning to stay in Kadikoy.\n\nDay 7: Take a walking tour of Istanbul\n\nDay 8: Go to a hamam, shop around a bit. Take an \"off-the-beaten path walking tour\".\n\nDay 9: (Appreciate suggestions on what to do)\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Bosphorus Cruise was probably my favourite thing in Istanbul, and it's only a couple dollars. Being your first visit to Istanbul and a limited time, I'd also tend to suggest staying near Galata Tower instead, being more central to seeing all the sights. Go to Kadikoy during one of your days to check it out.\n\nIn Goreme there's not much reason to rent a motorcycle. Everything is within reasonable walking distance, and lots of good walks/hikes.",

It still goes all the way up the Bosphorus and it's about .75 cents USD. Check out Rumeli Fortress",

            "comment": "I just returned from turkey, and I have to second the suggestion of probably leaving a day or two in between in gerome for the hot air balloon flights. I was fortunate enough to have favorable weather, but I heard from other travellers that the flights were canceled in consecutive succession in the prior days due to the wind conditions. I would suggest that you sneak in probably a horse back sunset tour there too, or probably a sunset atv tour (more mainstream). \n\nFor Istanbul, you could probably visit some of the other iconic attractions (dolmabache palace, galata tower, etc) if your walking tour doesn't cover it. The walking tour usually doesn't cover too many places, considering that most places would involve a whole lot of queuing. Another option would be to visit the asia side of istanbul too. Hope this helps!",

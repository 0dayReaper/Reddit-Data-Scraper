            "comment": "So Indonesia is pretty big but assuming you go to somewhere popular like Bali you will have no trouble meeting people in either location.  \n\nThe big difference is going to be the types of people you meet.  Indonesia will have a lot more Australians, and also more of a hippie/yoga sort of crowd for lack of a better description.  \n\nPortugal/Spain have tons of hostels in most major tourist locations and the crowd will likely skew younger and more British/American.  Especially if you go during the summer.  \n\nReally will come down to the individual hostel you stay at, activities you do, and time of year though.  I would pick based more on what you want to do because neither place will be difficult to meet people.  Unless you\u2019re going to somewhere super remote in Indonesia.  \n\nIf you end up in Lisbon I recommend Home Hostel and Yes Hostel.  Same owners, very easy to meet people and generally good vibes.",

            "comment": "In addition to destination, check whether it's high season or low season. If it's high season, you'll meet more people, although prices might be higher and fewer accommodations available. If it's low season, there might be fewer people around. \n\nAlso read reviews to get the vibe of the hostel. Then choose what would be the best match for your personality. If you want to party, stay at a party hostel. If you want to chill, stay at a chill hostel. \n\nOr get the best of both worlds by staying at a chill hostel that's close to a party hostel where you can walk over and party, then at the end of the night you can stumble home and sleep in peace. \n\nAnother way to get the best of both worlds is to book a private room in a hostel that has a common area. You can meet people in the common area, then retreat to your room when you need a break.\n\nOr stay at an Airbnb and book Airbnb Experiences to meet other travelers. Someone else mentioned Airbnb Experiences, and one thing that caught my eye was photo tours where either the tour guide takes pictures of you or your fellow travelers can. Taking pictures of yourself when traveling solo can be a hassle, so that looked like a good solution, along with meeting people. \n\nHope this helps.",

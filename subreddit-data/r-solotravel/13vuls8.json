    "postText": "I am from the US staying in Israel for a couple weeks. My phone was stolen last night. My insurance will cover once I am back in the US but still need a phone for these next 2 weeks. I am not sure what is the best option.  Could I go and buy the cheapest iPhone here and sell it once I get back to the US?",

I would buy a cheap android phone if it's just for two weeks as you're likely to lose a lot of money if you resell the iPhone in the US.",

We got one with cheese and wine included, nothing posh but it was cool.\n\nIf you like bars I think the NDSM area in Amsterdam is a very nice spot to hang out, a bit outside of the main tourist area.\n\nVenice - if I were in Northern Italy, I definitely wouldn\u2019t spend 6 days in Venice. I always felt it gets unreasonably crowded. I don\u2019t remember commute times anymore, so not sure how realistic these are for day trips, but in Northern Italy I really liked the streets of Verona, and lake Garda was also really nice.\n\nEnjoy the trip!",

A lot of free museums, love the Chinatown near Soho, theatre in West End, very easy to take day trips to other neat cities like Bath, there\u2019s also cool areas to explore like Shoreditch. Versailles might take up a whole day, fyi - I\u2019d also book the option with the tour, it\u2019s not that much more money and you get to see areas other people don\u2019t. Venice I\u2019d take a day for the palace and basilica, a day to explore, and that would probably be enough. You can travel between Florence and Venice relatively quickly if you want to do that too. I did a similar itinerary for Nice but took a day trip to Eze instead of Monaco. I also did a hike at Calanques National Park if you like that type of thing. My biggest advice to Amsterdam would be to book in advance - a lot of things book up really quickly including Van Gogh. I was underwhelmed by the Rijkmuseum especially since they\u2019ve removed their Vermeers, had a friend do Heineken and loved it. We also visited Albert Cruyp market which was cool, the Red Light museum, and Museum Ons\u2019 Lieve Heer op Solder (secret church) if you want to look up other interesting things to do.",

They're both huge and varied cities where you can spend weeks at end. London would need atleast 3 clear days of hectic sightseeing, and has more than a dozen worthwhile day trip options (Oxford, Cambridge, Bath, York, Stonehenge, Dover, Jurassic Coast, Windsor...). It's the same for Paris, there's an endless array of sights in town, and a huge list of day trip options (Versailles apart, there's Fontainebleu, Reims, Mont St Michel, D-Day beaches, Giverny...). I'd give them both 5-6 days apiece at least.\n\nAmsterdam is my least favourite big city in Europe. I personally found it too crowded and overhyped. 4 days there sounds sufficient enough in my head, but if it were up to me, I'd skip it altogether and focus just on London, Paris, and a third city or region.",

In other words, are you flying back to the US from Amsterdam?",

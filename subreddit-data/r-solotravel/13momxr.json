Watch a movie on your phone or see if there is something playing locally in English (depending on where you are eg. Berlin you can certainly do this). You also don't have to keep going to museums, there is a saturation point for sure. Take it slow for a day or two.",

I was there a month and went to several different countries (I was part of a youth orchestra that was touring and playing concerts.)  But towards the end of so many places with food different than I was used to and amenities in the house that weren't like the ones at home...well, I just started to long for something familiar.\n\nTowards the end of my stay, my host mother (we stayed with families in the community) got me Kellogg Cornflakes.  I hadn't asked for them - I think she thought, as an American, that I would want them.\n\nI never ate cornflakes at home, didn't particularly like them.  But I was so glad to have them then!  It was a very kind gesture.  I was a young person a very long way from home and having something that screamed \"America!\" was very comforting.",

Sometimes for the wrong reasons, just to say they've been to 'x' amount of countries. I understand people who have limited time or funds trying to cram it all in, but it does a disservice to yourself and time/energy overall. Slow it down, soak it up.",

I backpacked for five years in Europe and the Middle East and so grateful I have photographs I can relate to. Obviously I had to work as well but the \" holidays\" were really good quality time because I had learned to slow down. Personally I am not keen on cities because they all start to look the same in the end. Why not explore outside of the cities. Forests and coastal areas can be great places to slow the brain down and listen to your own footsteps for a while..I think Petra in Jordan did that for me. It is a world class site but once I got away from the crowds it was incredibly peaceful. My only regret is I haven't been back to explore even more.",

    "postText": "Dalaman seems to be me well enough; visa, flights, and budget wise.\n\nMy preference list isn\u2019t the long, just need a scenery, semi-quiet (but not dead) area with a nice swimmable beach. I\u2019m debating between marmaris, icmeler, olu deniz - and I\u2019m open for any other suggestions.\n\nI\u2019m concerned about the commute from the airport to any of them as I don\u2019t want to pay for a taxi and they have no option to book a bus shuttle online. Anyone got experience with that?\n\nI\u2019m looking into B&amp;Bs in order to have flexibility with the food (in case the hotel\u2019s food is mediocre) but I dunno if I\u2019m making a mistake and whether there won\u2019t be lots of restaurants or they\u2019ll be extra tourist priced. Any thought on that?\n\nThanks in advance!",

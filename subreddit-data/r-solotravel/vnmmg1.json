    "postText": "So I'm a dumbass who thought he booked tickets to go to Machu Picchu, but it turns out I forgot to pay, and my reservation was cancelled 5 hours after I made it a few weeks ago.  And for those of you who don't know, Machu Picchu is basically booked weeks in advance and I'm leaving Peru before the next spot is free.  But I didn't realize this until I was at the train station and decided to ride the train and test my luck, which didn't work.  And now I'm sitting in a restaurant in Agua Calientes contemplating my poor attention to detail lol.  Though on the plus side, I was able to snag a table with a good view, and the train ride itself was fun.\n\nAnyways, it would make me feel a lot better to hear about other mistakes people made, ideally of this same nature.",

I thought I\u2019d be able to withdraw some cash from an ATM or pay for the visa on arrival with card, but for some reason my card wasn\u2019t working. I couldn\u2019t get into the country because I didn\u2019t have the correct currency to pay for the visa, and my cards weren\u2019t working to withdraw any cash. Luckily a kind person behind me offered to pay for my visa and I was able to get into contact with a family member to help check on my cards and activate them. It was one of the most touching moments of kindness I\u2019d experienced, and also a lesson to always always always carry enough cash on you while traveling.",

Seriously, I tried like 6. I got to the airport, tried 2 exchanges there, no luck, but one of the clerks swore they had to have some in another booth \"inside\", after you go through the passport check. I went through, found the \"inside\" one, surprise: no Yen. About 16 hours later, I arrived to Tokyo without any Japanese Yen in my wallet.\n\nFortunately, the visa is free and easy for us Hungarians, so I got into the country, but had no money I could use. I needed to take a bus into the city, but the bus people only took cash. It was evening and every shop and exchange was closing at the airport one after another. My right ear also got clogged during descent and *really* didn't want to unclog, and I was wearing my glasses which are a bit weaker than I need because I usually wear contacts when I leave the house. I was practically half-deaf and half-blind.\n\nI asked like 3 attendants if they knew where I could exchange Hungarian Forints to Japanese Yen, but I think one didn't even understand me, and another one sent me to an exchange which didn't want my Forints (can't blame them). Finally, the 3rd one actually pointed me to an exchange at a far corner of the terminal, I got there like 10 minutes before it closed and finally managed to exchange some money at a horrendous rate.\n\nNow here's the fun part: I had about 50 Euros in my wallet. I'm preeeeetty sure any exchange would've happily taken them, but in my half-deaf, half-blind, panicked state, I hadn't event thought about trying.\n\nLive and learn, I guess.",

Unfortunately jetlag hit that night. My flight was at 1 and I live a good hour from the airport. I woke up at 3am, fell back asleep, and then startled awake at 10.30. I literally dashed out of the house, drove like a maniac to the airport and miraculously made the flight.

Great!\n\nI had done tons of solo travel all over at this point, and never thought anything further about my flight until I arrived at AMS airport. \"Do you have an India visa?\". \"No, I'm just transiting on my way to Nepal and I can get that on arrival.\" I guess they didn't think anything further of it either.\n\nSo I arrive in Frankfurt airport, get to my gate, and the Air India agent asks to see my India visa. \"No, I'm just transiting on my way to Nepal.\" He lets me on the flight. Clearly he didn't think anything further of it.\n\nOn my flight to Delhi, I start to think more about this. I'm transiting, yes, but I'm also taking an intra-India flight to do so. I hadn't thought about this when booking or so confidently explaining my situation to the gate agents. I looked through the information in the booklet on the flight and it explained that some flights were transiting internationally (with XYZ flight numbers), but some were considered domestic (with  other ABC numbers). My ongoing flight was ABC. Uh oh.\n\nI arrive to Delhi and sure enough, someone does think further or my situation. There is a man directing people to either immigration or sterile transit (no customs needed for a transfer). He looks at my flight number on my next flight and points to customs. \"So you see, that's not going to be possible...\".\n\nSo instead, I ended up in a room full of people who also made visa fuck ups and were awaiting deportation. In the end, Air India eventually came through for me and got me on a direct flight to KTM. Huge props to them.",

Immediately the doors closed behind me and my possessions (minus passport, wallet and phone which were in my pocket) went to Frankfurt without me. A couple of trains and a flight later, I was in Frankfurt waiting for my suitcases but they weren\u2019t on the train. A few long days spent calling around and finally found them in Utrecht (Netherlands conductors took them off before entering Germany). Rented a car and drove the 12 hours round trip from Frankfurt to Utrecht and back to Frankfurt and all was well when I started work on Monday morning.  \n\nI don\u2019t tell this story often \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

                            "comment": "Aight strap in. \n\nSo this was in the mid 2010s and I had been doing Workaway placements in Central Europe. Some were good, some were awful, but what they all had in common was that all the hosts were veggies. At the time I was a voracious meat eater and the whiplash-like change of diet was tough for the few weeks that I was doing it. \n\nFor my last host, I was staying in rural Czechia. On finishing that one, I decided to move on to Budapest and do a bit of hostelling there. I took the night train from Prague to Budapest, arriving around 8am and got to my hostel. \n\nAfter a month of eating salads and lentils, I just wanted chicken wings. I didn't care. All I wanted was some spicy buffalo sauce and a mountain of wings. \n\nI got to my hostel at 9am, they allowed an early check in - and then I googled where in Budapest did chicken wings. \n\nNow it was only around a decade ago, but Google was certainly a bit more rustic back then and didn't give a lot of results. According to Google, the only nearby place in Budapest that sold chicken wings was Hooters...\n\nI'm not the type of person to ever go to a Hooters, however I really wanted those wings, and nothing was going to stop me, so off I went. \n\nI got there at 09:45 and that's when I realised that the place didn't open until 10am. So now I looked like a pathetic weirdo who was desperately waiting for Hooters to open. There wasn't even a caf\u00e9 nearby so I literally sat on a bench across the road from the place. Young guy. Alone. Outside Hooters. 09:55. I must have looked so desperate (Which I was, albeit for wings...)\n\nWhen it did open, I walked in and the waitress began trying to talk to me (as I suppose they do there). I didn't want to appear standoffish but I was literally only there for wings and not the Hooters experience. She couldn't really speak English and I absolutely cannot speak Hungarian. I tried to say that I had been to the town of Szeged before but she thought I was talking about the Sziget festival. \n\nThrough much pointing and gesturing I end up ordering the largest plate of wings on the menu. It came out wayyyy too fast. In retrospect they probably heated up whatever was left behind from the night before, but I didn't care. I was ravenous. I inhaled the wings and left as fast as I could. They smelled a bit odd, but I put it down to me not having meat for a few weeks. \n\n2 hours later I was in the hostel bathroom dying. This was at one of the old great Budapest Party Hostels so I had signed up for the Danube Party Boat that night. Poor idea. I spent the entire evening in the undulating toilet cubicle which I had to keep closed with my leg. \n\nI was only doing a layover in Budapest as I was meeting a friend in Dubrovnik. I got a slow train to Zagreb and then an excruciatingly slow night bus to Dubrovnik. \n\nThe bus left at 11pm and was due in at 8am. The bus had no WiFi, no reclining seats, no toilet, no seatbelts, and no power chargers. \n\nI was feeling so very ill and my stomach was churning. I was too afraid to cough. I got some sleep for 30 mins before a British Stag party got on in Split at 5am. It was hellish. I was too afraid to use the 1 rest stop we had as I knew I would probably take too long. \n\nJust when I thought it was over, we hit that little strip of Bosnia which requires everyone to do passport checks (once leaving Croatia, then driving a few KM and then another check when entering Croatia again). It was a busy day and we were delayed 3 hours. I won't be too vile but there was a stage where I was utterly convinced I had shat myself and I was waiting in sheer terror for the smell to emanate through the stuffy packed bus. \n\nVile warning: &gt;!It was a fart so wet, heavy, and juicy I was convinced it had come out as a solid, or at least liquid. Somehow it didn't even smell. Guardian Shit Angel was looking out for me 100%!&lt;\n\nThe worst part was my friend who I was to meet in Dubrovnik was still in Dublin when I was in Split, but arrived via aeroplane an hour before me.\n\nBy that stage the sickness was wearing off but Dear God I only recall misery from that Budapest - Dubrovnik couple of days.",

Luckily it wasn\u2019t sold out I just booked another ticket for next day. Dust hands. Alls well. Only out 20 euro. \n\nBut my dumb ass was a day off. I checked out of my hotel the next am and the lady was like, \u201cOrly? I think you\u2019re booked in here til tomorrow?\u201d but I was waayyyy too confident: \u201clol yah I mean my train is for today so I\u2019m pretty sure\u2026.\u201d\n\nYah. I rebooked my train for the WRONG DAY. Idk why I just had it in my head it was a Sunday train and I checked out of the hotel to go to the station fully convinced she was the crazy one. \n\nAnyway got paranoid and checked my rental dates in Girona: she was right. I wasn\u2019t due to check in til next day. I immediately turned around and she let me back in my old room since it hadn\u2019t been cleaned yet. \n\nAll in all worked out fine, and was really glad for the extra beach day. A bit embarrassing and more adrenaline than I needed, but a good lesson on attention to detail for my adhd brain \ud83d\ude2c",

Had to spend whatever little change I had at an Internet cafe to email my brother asking for a western union transfer. And shame-eat some Jollibee spaghetti. While waiting for my bro's response (due to the completely different time zones) I didn't know what to do so I slept in a park that night. Seemed alright. Some people walking through the park later that evening were like wtf are you doing, one offered that I could sleep at his place for the night, I accepted. We arrive at his home, which was more like a collection of shacks with all the extended family there. I ask where I'm sleeping, as it looks like there's no extra space, and he says I can have his bed. Of course once I'm in bed he also climbs in bed. Turns out his wife left him because he's (can you guess?) - gay. He's trying to get me to fool around with him, wants to give me a blowjob as he's better than girls anyway. I could just close my eyes and pretend it\u2019s a girl lol. I give him the ultimatum to stop trying or I'm leaving, which was a bluff bc I have no fucking clue where I am, he gets all huffy and turns over to the other side of the bed and well, that was that. I didn\u2019t really sleep, but didn\u2019t feel any pokey pokings either. We eat cereal in the morning and his cousin who drives a tuk tuk takes me to the western union and the money is there! I rebook my flight and get out of there. The end.\n\nDon\u2019t get pickpocketed with all your cards and cash in one place!",

Got my passsport and tried to check in for the flight, but they wouldn't let me because it was now less than an hour to departure and an international flight.

When it came time for me to fly home, I got to the airport and went to use the check-in kiosk, which didn't work for some reason.  I went over to the desk, gave them my info, and after a bit of confusion they dropped the horrible truth on me.\n\nI'd booked my flight home for the correct day of the week and time, but a week prior.\n\nI'd probably made the fuck up by selecting the correct date while booking, then the page getting reloaded or something and I was in a rush to get through my previous steps, though I'm not sure how I missed the date in the emails the airline sent me.  Regardless, after panicking for a bit, I actually managed to get a flight only a few hours later (with some help from my parents who were actually in front of a computer), but it was definitely a costly mistake, in money and definitely in my pride.\n\nWorst part is this is far from the only time I've mixed up dates with online booking, none have had such high stakes but some have been even more embarrassing, I seem to have a hard time learning this particular lesson.",

Finally arrived, the hostel was closed at night and locked with a 4 digit code which I had saved ... on my dead phone. By some miracle, despite having only seen the code once, I was able to remember it and let myself in.\n\nI'm usually much more prepared, the breakup really compromised my reasoning.

            "comment": "The whole ''I want to go to out-of-the-way places, see how people really live'' thing, you can get away with it in some countries or regions, in others it verges on stupidity.\n\nThe time I ''took some back-streets'' in Ho Chi Minh City, was followed by a guy that was out to rob me (stupidly had a new digital SLR slung around my neck), I ended up getting lost in the tangle of streets with this guy following me the whole way, ended up in a live-kill market. Saw and heard things in that market that should have put me off animal products forever.\n\nThe worst though was in Cambodia. Stopped in Battambang for one night. I learnt later that Battambang has another nickname which made total sense to me when I learnt it. I hate touristy areas so went for a wander to the outskirts and found this hotel that looked okay, at least externally. Went in and asked for a room, the owners spoke no English and I certainly don't speak Khmer. Still, I managed to convey that I wished to stay there. They looked horrified, which totally confused me. I was tired, hot and persistent however so they let me take a room for the night.\n\nGot to the room, which I could only describe as being built for orgies. Bed almost in the centre of the room, a weird hexagonal shape and raised up on like a dais. Mirrors everywhere, including on the ceiling. I thought it was hilarious, but made sure I checked the bed linen. Really, I should have just gone back and said ''no thanks'', and kept going. I was absolutely dog-tired though and you get some really bad rooms everywhere you go, so whatever. I had a shower and thought I would head out for something to eat.\n\nIt had gotten dark, and just up the road from this hotel was a side street which had lots of fluoro lighting and karaoke pumping from various establishments. Sweet, I like watching karaoke so I decided to head down. You're accustomed to getting looks as a pasty-redhead tourist, especially in SE Asia, but I started to get a little unnerved by just how much I seemed to draw attention. I quickly headed into this karaoke hall that had patrons drinking beer and eating food. Right, let's just go in and get a feed and get the hell out of here back to my Porn Studio room.\n\nOnce again, it was like those old Westerns where a stranger walks into the saloon. A buzz kind of went through the place, and *everybody* turned to look at me. I sat quickly, a lovely woman (who spoke no English, and I speak no Khmer) quickly came over with a bucket of Angkor beer bottles in ice. I gestured for a menu, which seemed to cause her some alarm but she came back with one. Menu was written in Khmer so I just picked something off one of the pictures. The food arrived quite promptly, which was merciful, so I just tucked in. \n\nAnyway, in strode this man with an older teenage boy in tow. This caused quite a lot of hushed chatter among the locals and averted gazes. This man was well-dressed, and I thought he looked like some official-type. He looked over at me and then proceeded to stride straight over to me. The next few minutes was one of the most bizarre times of my life. He said ''hello'', and I responded in kind. He said ''you're very handsome'' and then proceeded to reach out and start stroking my head with his hand. I froze completely, my eyes darted to those around me and all I saw were horrified faces peering back at me. I muttered a ''thanks'' and just proceeded to keep eating, my mind racing the whole time. He then said ''very handsome'', and (I'm not kidding)  he pushed his groin at me so that, basically, sitting on my left shoulder was his crotch. I flashed a look at the boy and he looked horrified and repulsed. I just sat, stared ahead, and just pretended I wasn't there - his hand stroking my head the whole time. This seemed to take forever, and honestly it took longer for him to register my disgust than it ought to have. He did stop however, just turned and left. I just sat dazed, with pitying looks being shot my way from everyone. The lovely woman came, I paid without finishing my food and just left.\n\nTalking to another traveller about this in Siem Reap, he kindly let me know that Battambang has the nickname of ''Bottombang'' and is quite the sex tourist town, albeit for men who prefer the company of other men. I believe the town has tried to clean up its image in recent years though (my little encounter was about 7-8 years ago).\n\nAfter that little foray, I decided it best to not venture beyond the ''safe'' touristy areas in my travels. Not by myself at least anyway.",

            "comment": "First international trip I was so excited, I walked right out of the airport without getting a sim card.  The tram was fairly new, so they had lovely employees helping the tourists get on their way, so it still didn't hit me.  I was staring out the tram window with child-like wonderment the entire trip, just a happy little moron.  Then I pulled my phone out for the walking instructions to the hotel and that's when I realized my mistake.  \n\nI had looked up the instructions the night before, but it was quickly obvious that I did a piss poor job remembering them.  I hadn't slept on the flight, because of the excitement and I found out Edinburgh has some San Francisco-esque steep streets, which is a blast with luggage.  Thankfully a wonderful local was kind enough to point me in the right direction after about 30 minutes of trying on my own.  All I could do was laugh at myself, good lesson to learn early on, always have paper back ups of important info.  You know, common sense.  I will always love Edinburgh for the stupidity it inspired in me and the kindness of the people who helped me.\n\nI have to say, you've got a great attitude about this.  While I'm sorry it happened, I think your attitude will likely help in still making the most of this trip.  I hope it's better than you expect, and I hope that some day you hit a jackpot of good luck on your travels.  And this may be naive of me, but could you call in and check, maybe someone has cancelled or got sick and you can squeeze in?  Fingers crossed a miracle is in your near future!",

I managed to do ALL of this completely zonked. But as soon as I sat down, I nodded off to sleep. All my hard work, down the drain. When I woke up, I was sober and promptly realised I'd missed my flight. I'm a bit more seasoned now, and if this happened again, I would take it as a sign to stay in the city a little bit longer and take the next cheap flight. But I was 18 at the time and scared shitless, so I booked a flight for the same day. A couple of hundred euros I'll never get back :(\n\nI also went to Auschwitz recently with my boyfriend. We are both living in the Benelux region and are used to efficient and regular public transport. We didn't even think to check the train schedule back to Krakow.

They were kind enough to return that deposit\u2026..\n weeks after I was home. \n\nlesson learned and it was a very frugal trip after that. had fun anyway and never bought those dumb currency cards again.",

The airport is a zoo but it's also huge, so I was able to find a section where no flights left the entire time. No other people within like 200 feet of me, and a good phone charging spot.\n\nBasically a guilt-free 12 hours of looking at my phone, reading, and having 15 minute periods of horrendous \"sleep\"",

So I could barely walk, only had those shitty shoes, and it turned out they didn't have my size at any of the nearby shoe stores. Eventually figured out that there was shoe stores with bigger sizes near the American military base. I had a taxi take me there, and the largest shoes they had fit me perfectly. After that the trip was great, but I lost at least 3-4 days to that lol.\n\nLesson learned: make sure to wear proper shoes and bring backup shoes if you're planning to walk a lot.",

Well that sounded too risky to my friend and myself, and Indians we spoke to said we should buy tickets at a travel agent instead. We spend hours going from travel agent to travel agent - each one has a story about why we can't fly to Leh but need to fly to Kashmir instead e.g. flights are sold out /  Leh destroyed by recent avalanche etc. At this time there is active fighting going on in Kashmir so we weren't interested. Near the end of a wasted day, a travel agent says he can sell us the last two tickets available for Leh. Great! Twice the cost we were expecting but ok. We pay the money then wait for two hours in the travel agency waiting for the tickets to be 'printed'.\nNext morning we're at the airport for our flight. Only four passengers on the flight - rows of empty seats - us and 2 Germans. The Germans had bought their tickets at the airport that morning as instructed by Lonely Planet. Paid exactly half the cost of our tickets.\nLeh was amazing though",

            "comment": "Thankfully don't think I've made any actual major mistakes with bookings etc (maybe once I booked the wrong date because of an issue with the payment and had to start again and rushed it).\n\nI was scammed very badly though while in Istanbul (although freshly travelling after 2 years probably didn't help and I was a bit rusty).\n\nI was needing a haircut, so googled places for reviews. Passed one but it was full, so kept walking. Saw a sandwich board sign on the street and some guy standing there - he noticed me looking, asked if I needed a haircut and I said yes, then followed him. This probably should have been the first red flag. We go down the alley a bit, then up these stairs to a little salon (basically 2 chairs and a table for the till). Another guy was finishing up being done so that sort of settled my mind a little. Had the haircut, then he wanted to do a little of my beard. I said no, but he just trimmed a little and then suddenly did more so he had to keep going to keep it even. Then while I was being distracted doing that he called a woman over to do wax for my ears and face (very hot and not enjoyable and didn't want it). But hot wax was on me so it had to come off. Then suddenly she's putting this mask thing on my face, and at that point it felt off, but I couldn't do much about it. Then blackhead removal (very painful) and kept doing more and more - but always started the next thing before the current step was done so I couldn't really stop it easily. It still felt off but at that point I was thinking 'just go with it, it must be just part of the haircut'.\n\nIt finally ends and I come to pay. It should have been about \u00a312. They put the amount in Lira on a calculator, and it seems a lot, so I go to my phone to convert it. And it comes to \u00a3150! I said I only came for the haircut, I didn't ask for all the other stuff, they just gave it to me as part of the service. Complain a while, but they point to te camera up in the corner saying 'no, you got all this stuff...' basically threatening me a bit. Eventually they reduced the price, but to \u00a3120 or 130. I don't have anything near that amount of cash on me so said I had to go to an ATM (planning on legging it). They said no, so gave them what cash I had, about \u00a350 worth (hoping that would be ok while I go to the ATM and leg it). They then say I can pay by card. I didn't want to as I had to pit in my PIN so basically screwed by trying to make any claims after. They weren't being friendly, and at that stage I just wanted out of the situation, so just paid the remaining on my card and left feeling very angry and pissed off.\n\nLater I found them on google maps and see the reviews were all basically saying it's a scam and they rip everyone off. Annoyingly see some people refused to pay or threatened to call police (which worked for them). But left my own negative reviewd everywhere I could warning people.\n\nDefinitely should have trusted my gut more as I knew it felt off early on. And then should have stuck to only paying the original haircut price (but being an introvert doesn't help with that). That's the worst I've been scammed while travelling - so definitely check google reviews before going certain places.",

Maybe I had checked and noticed usually tickets were available same day. Anyways, went to see the Coliseum, but it closed early that day because of Easter weekend celebrations. That was my last day in Rome so yay.",

We had a fancy dinner and eat too much wine the night before so we got to the palace late in the afternoon. They were closing early that day to film the show Versailles so while we did see a lot of it we didn\u2019t get into the gardens. It was our last day in France, I was so sad.",

Not to realise that when I'd booked my hostel, it was is Hanoi. \n\nThis distinction is a little clearer in Vietnamese but just typing in quickly in Booking.com... I didn't realise. When we were checking out and the receptionist was asking about our plans and she was like \"well that's a long journey how are you getting to the airport?\" Needless to say I was very confused and stressed.\n\n But I decided to just go to Hanoi since the booking was non-refundable. A quick Skyscanner search, \u00a345 and an overpriced taxi and I was in Hanoi. Felt so stupid though because my friend asked about my side of the trip 3 times before we left.",

She checked me in, got me my pass and said that if I needed a ride to my guesthouse she could assist with that. This whole time I thought she worked for Air Asia so I said sure and she took me to a desk not far away from the check-in area. She got me a ride to my guesthouse booked and also said I could book tours for a discount if I wanted. I booked a trip to an Elephant Sanctuary and the Golden Triangle. \n\nSome time after I paid I realized she didnt work for Air Asia at all and was concerned that I paid for nothing. Thankfully a ride was ready for me when I landed and sure enough I was picked up for the tours as well. I believe I paid more than I might have had I booked the tours in Chiang Mai, but it wasnt too much more and they were still worth it. The only reason I'd say it was a scam was that the lady presented herself like she worked for Air Asia. That and I dont think she really had the authority to check me in haha.",

Some friends and I (8 of us to be exact) were traveling to Kitzbuhel, Austria. It was a 3-hr train ride, where we rented cars, and 6 or 7 hours of driving, IIRC. \n\nNo hotel booked (we were young, dumb, and broke, so we planned on sleeping in the cars). \n\nNight one, got there successfully. Party started the next morning at 8 am. Eventually that evening we split up, I was off falling in love with a man I just met and having the time off my life. \n\nI arrived back to my car with 7 friends trying to sleep in it (instead of the more reasonable 4 in each car). \n\n(It was also below freezing, so sleeping outside was not an option)\n\nConfused, a few wake up to let me in, and explain why there were 7 in there. \n\nIt turns out that in the hours we were separated, the keeper of the \u201cother\u201d car keys put his $500+ jacket down with the keys in it, got a little too wasted, and left it a little too long. Not only was his prized jacket stolen, but so were the keys to the other car. \n\nThe biggest catch? You may have already realized from details earlier: We rented the cars 7 hours drive away in Switzerland.  They had to convince the company to drive a key out to them to get back into the car. \n\nWhile I wasn\u2019t in the car that had to stay the extra day, it sounded like a good time, since they made a new friend who welcomed them into his home, and continued partying til they brought the key back. \n\nOh to be 20 years old and so foolish again.",

He fudged up the time we were suppose to be there versus take off, so we ended up GETTING to the airport when in reality the flight was taking off so we missed our flight. \n\n\\- totally separate trip, again Paris related: **Not budgeting**. Right after our wedding, we took off on a 10 day excursion that went to London, Paris, Berlin and Venice. Because we didnt have a joint account set up, he deposited a majority of the money made out to us in his account. I didnt think the wiser. Well that back fired because we were yolo'ing the hell out of our trip and were broke by the time our Paris leg was up. Thankfully I had my own money but because of that we do not share money at all lol. Mind you, this was 8 years ago so he has grown up a lot since then but on a side note I will tell you, not sharing money makes for a happier marriage IMO. Dont beat yourself up too much OP.

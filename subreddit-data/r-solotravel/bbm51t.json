The hiking is fantastic if you're there in the right season, and even just driving around to different towns and fjords can easily fill a week's worth of time. In terms of towns/culture, the only major town is Torshavn, the capital. It's still a pretty small town though, and honestly wouldn't want to spend more then 2 days fully spent in the city. Most of the other towns are very small and built around the fishing communities so probably not too much \"culture\" for tourists to take part of in that regard.",

My round trip flight from Chicago was like $175 last December... \n\nThat said, I certainly didn't mind the white sand beaches, either",

You'd just need to walk along the road to the town of Bour, and then there is a hiking trail that connects Bour to Gasadalur that lets you avoid walking through the tunnel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCamera Gear:\n\n\\- Sony a7riii body\n\n\\-  Sony FE 24-240mm f/3.5-6.3 OSS Lens",

There\u2019s a really good bus and ferry service that gets to almost all of the towns (small villages get service maybe twice or three times a week), and apparently it\u2019s very easy and safe to hitchhike.\n\nIn terms of cost. The biggest expenses for me was airfare and rental car. There only maybe 5 or so cities that fly into the islands, with Iceland and Copenhagen being the cheapest (only about $200 round trip). So if you can get to one of those cities cheaply, then overall it should be really affordable (I paid about $500 total flying from Boston).",

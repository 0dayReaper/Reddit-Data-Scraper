I want to visit the following:\n\n* Hanoi\n* Ha Giang Loop\n* Ha Long Bay\n* Hoi An\n* Ho Chi Minh\n\nIs this too ambitious for 11 days? If not, can you advice on which order to which trip? It seems like Ha Giang Loop is far from Hanoi so not sure if it is best to travel to Ha Long Bay first and make my way to Ha Giang Loop from there.\n\nI love nature, food, culture, museums, history. Would you recommend any other places? Thank you in advance :)",

Bus back to Hanoi. This might take 4-5 days.\n\nHead to Ha Long Bay (stay overnight on a cruise), (2 days), head to Ninh Binh (2 days). Then spent the last 2 days exploring Hanoi and flight back. \n\nLeave HoiAn &amp; HCMC for the next trip. Or skip the Ha Giang loop then you might be able to fit in Hoi An and HCMC",

I just did two months riding motorbikes around VN after living in HCMC for five years and in my opinion the north has way more stuff to do. The Ha Giang Loop was probably the best part. Make sure to do the Sky Path hike. In 11 days I would do: Hanoi for history and culture, Ninh Binh for nature, Cat Ba island instead of a Ha long Cruise, and then somehow get to Ha Giang for the loop which can be done in three days but getting their and back will be a day at least.",

The Ha Long Bay tours are more geared to local tourists who want a \u201cluxury\u201d experience, meaning food and lots of down time. The \u201ccruises\u201d take a long time as well and you are trapped on the boat for almost the whole time. Tbh the scenery of Ha Long Bay is all the same and you kinda get the vibe after an hour of so on the water, I don\u2019t really think you need days on end of it, but that\u2019s just me. If you are on a tight schedule Cat Ba island has much more to offer. You can get there on the ferry from Hai Phong city (not as scenic) or Ha Long city (a pretty ride that will give you the \u201ccruise\u201d experience). Both are easily accessible by a short bus from Hanoi. \n\nAlso avoid monkey island, in Ha Long bay or really anywhere is SE Asia. Tour guides sell monkey island to naive tourists who think monkeys are cute but they are the exact opposite. In tourist areas especially, they are aggressive little shits who will attack tourists. I\u2019ve known many people who had to get expensive rabies shots b/c of monkey attacks.",

However, you might enjoy 1-2 nights. I would find this amount in 11 days super stressful and I'd be utterly exhausted afterwards. I'd say do either North or South Vietnam in that time and get a return flight from either Hanoi or HCMC.",

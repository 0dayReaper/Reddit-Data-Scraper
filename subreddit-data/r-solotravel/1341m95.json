    "postText": "I haven\u2019t been able to find much information since there are three countries involved but I\u2019m a minor planning on staying in Barcelona for two weeks, and staying a weekend or two with my friend. However I will have to book hotels for weekdays since Spanish schools don\u2019t have term breaks on the same time as I do\n\nI\u2019m currently boarding in Germany with a HK passport and my school is my legal guardian(except for holidays), and another problem is my visa has also expired (I had an exemption slip from when I returned to home so I was able to get back but I\u2019m not sure about going to and from EU countries)\nCan someone tell me what I need to do in order not to fuck up? Thx \ud83e\udd72",

However if your visa is expired you might want to get that situation remedied, I'm not sure I understand what you mean with your description of your visa situation.",

If you fly you likely will have your Visa checked and could run into problems there.\n\nAlso check if you can book hotel/hostel as a minor because that's often not allowed too.",

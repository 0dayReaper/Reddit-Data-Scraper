    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019ve done loads of biking is Laos and North Vietnam, and prefer doing stuff by myself. \n\nSo, is Hi Giang loop worth it? Every video I\u2019ve seen of friends doing it seems like party hostels and beautiful landscapes (but nothing different from what I\u2019ve seen). \n\nIs it worth it if you\u2019re not keen on partying and group tours? I know police are quick to punish foreign drivers without a license, so can\u2019t go alone.\n\nThanks !",

The hostels I stayed at had a nice family style dinner and a few drinks after.\n\nThat being said, it's illegal without a license! I got very lucky, I completed the full loop (March this year) and got pulled over about half a mile from my hostel in Ha Giang. The police was really polite and helpful, they said the rental agency was to blame for renting out the bikes to people without a valid license. They confiscated my bike and let me leave with a letter for the rental agency, saying they should pay the fine in order to get the bike back. Obviously, the guys at the rental agency were not amused, but they accepted the letter and let me leave.",

Don't worry about going on your own, you'll meet a lot of people on the way while keeping your own pace.\n\nWhen the police pulled us over, they pulled over tour groups as well. There was an accident the day before, so they had a huge police force pulling all foreigners over, no exceptions (except those with an easy rider). All bikes were confiscated, didn't matter if you were with a tour group or not. It took a while, but the police officers were really nice and polite, no fines for foreigners, just for the rental agencies.",

    "postText": "Hi all\n\nI've recently seen a lot of Airbnb dire warnings on here and had a few bad experiences myself. Many of you have suggested hotels as an alternative and this sounds great in theory but also unsustainably expensive. What tips do you have for finding hotels which are good quality and affordable, especially for week+ long stays in cities and towns and how do you find them? \n\nThanks",

You just need to discuss the thing: ask for the manager or whatever and not simply go to reception front desk and try to make a deal. Nicer hotels with a higher cost are happy do this since they\u2019re not used to long stays and can be large buildings with tons of rooms. One time I stayed for a month in a luxury place for 100$ instead of 300$ a night. It is clearly a lot but all things considered was almost a bargain",

            "comment": "It really depends on what your budget is, but when I stay for around a week in a place I always try to stay in an apartment hotel so I can self cater, do laundry, have some extra space, etc. There are several major international chains (Citadines, Adagio, Adina, etc) and lots of local chains (Quest in Australia and NZ, Roomzzz in the UK, etc) and independent operators. I personally prefer Adina in the cities where they operate as their rooms often come with washing and drying machines and tend to be better maintained than the other chains. It's also an Australian company, and it's nice to have a touch of home in a foreign city!\n\nApartment hotels often offer discounts for relatively long term stays - some are explicitly set up for people to live in for months at a time on corporate postings, etc, and offer deals if you're staying for several weeks (often these need to be accessed via emailing the management).\n\nFailing that, if you're staying in a place for a week or more there's usually less need to stay somewhere central, and you can save a bit of money by booking a hotel outside the centre of the city or away from from the main attractions.",

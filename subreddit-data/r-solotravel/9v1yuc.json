    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI recently got back from ten days solo traveling around Iran, so I thought I'd do a quick write-up for any other women thinking about going.\n\n\n**Me:** Lady, dual US/EU citizen. Went to Iran on my EU passport because Americans can't travel alone. Many countries (including those in the EU) are eligible for a visa on arrival, but you have to submit a visa request a few days before you arrive. I elected to go through the Iranian consulate just to be safe, since my passport says I was born in the States. Had 0 issues.\n\n\n**Budget:** \u20ac500. I brought \u20ac600 just to be safe (Western bank cards don't work in Iran, so you need to bring all your money in cash). *However* Iran is **so cheap** I only spent \u20ac350, and that was including half my Christmas shopping.\n\nTotal cost breakdown: \n\n* \u20ac311 (flight)\n* \u20ac50 (visa)\n* \u20ac100 (catsitter)\n* \u20ac297 (all costs for 12-ish days in Iran, including accommodation, food, transport, entry tickets, etc)\n* \u20ac53 (Christmas shopping)\n\nTotal: \u20ac811. I'm not mad about it.\n\n**Trip length:** 10 days, plus arrival and departure days.\n\n**Destinations:** Tehran, Shiraz (flew from Tehran), Persepolis (day trip from Shiraz), Isfahan (bus from Shiraz), Qazvin (bus from Isfahan), Alamut Valley (day trip from Qazvin).\n\n**Accommodation:** Tehran Heritage Hostel (Tehran, \u20ac4/night for a dorm, met lovely people, the place was fine); Taha Hostel (Shiraz, \u20ac9/night for a private, great staff but the facilities are hilariously bad and a cockroach in my clean clothes); Atigh Hotel (Isfahan, \u20ac30/night for a room, this was my splurge after the cockroach and it was amazing and beautiful and I wanted to live here and they gave me an off-season discount); Minoo Hotel (Qazvin, \u20ac15/night for a room, allowed indoor smoking so my room reeked).\n\n**Activities:** \n\n* In Tehran, Golestan Palace, the grand bazaar, Saadabad palace complex, Darband, and my absolute favorite, the Holy Defense Museum, aka the weirdest museum you'll ever meet. It's all about the Iran/Iraq war, so it was really interesting to see how they've dealt with it, but holy propaganda, Batman. My favorite bit was the simulated minefield that I died in (do not dance through simulated minefields). I tried really hard to get into the US Den of Espionage (aka, the former embassy), but it's only open at the whims of the guards and they were not feeling it the day I arrived.\n\n* Persepolis, the ancient city sacked by Alex the Great. I went with a tour but promptly ditched them as soon as we arrived because I wanted to run around and climb up the mountain. My tour guide was a bit peeved but I found out later from the other people on the tour that the guide kind of sucked, so I wasn't sorry. Pasargadae was unfortunately closed due to Cyrus Day protests.\n\n* In Shiraz, the Pink Mosque (may or may not have accidentally broken into it, it was fine) which is amazing, even if you go on a cloudy day like I did; the bazaar, citadel, pars museum, the tomb of hafez, the big park on the mountain, and the Eram gardens (so nice!). \n\n* In Isfahan, explored a million mosques, the main square, the palace, and the Armenian cathedral which has an illumination of a guy getting his penis ripped off by a demon? Worth the cost of entry. Also ran around the ruins of the Zoroastrian fire temple.\n\n* Qazvin. Isn't super interesting on its own, but is a great jumping-off point for hiking in the VALLEY OF THE ASSASSINS, CAPS FOR AWESOMENESS. I knew this was going to be my favorite part of my trip so I'm glad I saved it for last. The VALLEY OF THE ASSASSINS is amazing, as are the ruins of the CASTLE OF THE ASSASSINS. So fucking fun. I went with a guide I found on a travel blog and he was fantastic, can only recommend him x 1000. My solo 11-hour tour cost a grand total of \u20ac40. I I gave him like 46 and he called me to tell me I'd overpaid.\n\n**What went right:** Everything. I knew I was going to love Iran, and I loved it more than that. It's stupidly beautiful, the food is amazing, the weather was perfect (sunny and low 70s every day, that's like 20 if you're not using freedom units, I think), and the people are amazing (as in, will walk up to you on the street and adopt you into their plans). For all you budget-conscious people out there, it's also so. stupidly. cheap. I'm talking \u20ac4 buses across the country, \u20ac1 meals, taxis across town for quarters. I booked one internal flight from Tehran to Shiraz, and the woman who helped me apologized for how expensive it was, being last minute and all. It was \u20ac14. \n\nIt was also incredibly safe--way safer than my current metropolis (Berlin) and my home one (Philly). I say this as a human with a significantly higher tolerance for risk than the vast majority of backpackers, but Iran was so safe it was alarming. Like, go on walks by yourself at night, safe. \n\nI met very few other solo travellers in general, and of course most of them were men. With the few women I did meet, a frequent topic of conversation was how incredibly safe Iran was and what a good solo lady destination it made. \n\n**What went wrong:** Really, nothing, or nothing of note. I wasn't super thrilled about carrying \u20ac600 in cash on me, but I split it up among my things and didn't have any problems. Iran was so cheap, I never changed more than \u20ac50 at a time because I couldn't be bothered with the eight million bills this gets you.\n\nOne thing that I was somewhat surprised by is how impossible it is to get around Iran on your own. You can't power through like in many other countries; you're truly fucked if you can't get the locals to help you (but your hostel/hostel knows this and will help you out). You need locals to book your tickets (and pay for them with their Iranian cards, which you then pay them back for), tell you where to go, talk to your taxi, etc. Oh, and drive. I had a moment a few weeks before my trip where I debated renting a car and I'm so glad I didn't because holy shit Iranians are the scariest drivers in the entire universe. I've lived in/been to a lot of places where the rules of the road are more like guidelines, but in Iran, it's straight anarchy. Trying to cross the street is a terrifying endeavor.\n\nOne thing I learned is that Iranians have this thing called *taarof* which means that if someone offers you something, you have to refuse twice before you can accept, and vice versa. The Iranians working in the hospitality industry know the foreigners are clueless so they don't do this, but everyone else will. There were a few times when I was trying to tip people and I *knew* they were doing taarof, but their reactions were so extreme--throwing the tip back at me and looking horrified--that I couldn't keep going even though I knew I was supposed to. The most useful Farsi phrase I picked up was *taarof nadari* or \"don't do the taarof thing,\" aka \"shut up and take my money.\"\n\n**Recommendations:** 1) Go, 2) Come back so we can talk about how amazing Iran is.\n\nLadies, on the subject of clothes. It's pretty easy to pick out the foreign women in Iran because they wear too many clothes/wear too few clothes/generally look homeless. I wore leggings under short/three-quarter sleeve dresses, a loose scarf, and a manteau--this overcoat-y thing you'll only ever find in Iran so just buy it there, mine was \u20ac3. Yes you are allowed to wear colors. Yes you can have a waist. For the love of God, leave your elephant pants at home.\n\nFor reference, [this] (https://i.imgur.com/IdCziPG.jpg) is what I wore. I know it was a good disguise because most people didn't realize I was foreign until I opened my mouth (I did a lot of confusing the Iranians).\n\n**Verdict:** 25/10 would recommend. Iran has easily slipped into my top 5 favorite countries and I'm looking forward to going back and exploring some of the other regions. \n\nA few pictures are [here](https://imgur.com/a/mr1dV7A)!\n\n*Edit:* Forgot to mention the toman/rial thing! So the currency is Iranian rial but inflation is so bad, everyone talks about prices in toman (rial minus a zero, so 50,000 toman is 500,000 rial). But to make it even more confusing, people drop all the zeroes when they talk about toman. So 50 toman is actually 50,000 toman is actually 500,000 rial.\n\nOn more than one occasion a cashier, frustrated at my inability to count so many zeroes on the spot, took my wallet, removed the proper amount of bills, and handed it back to me. Which in any other country I wouldn't have stood for and been worried about getting ripped of but Iranians are just so *nice.*",

I got lost in a small remote area in Iran and I had not one or two, but three families insist I stay with them after they realized I had missed the last bus to anywhere. They fed me AMAZING food until I was about to pop and kicked the kids out of a bedroom (after much tarof!) and drove me to the bus stop the next morning. This has become one of my most favorite memories from any of my travels.  I felt like family. \n\nThank you for sharing :)",

My experience was that, overwhelmingly, you just need to stand at a street corner and look a little lost. Locals usually are not pushing themselves onto you, but are curious and helpful. Maybe that was different for you, but I'd expect you'd be as readily approached by women. \n\nIt's beautiful to read this here. I made very similar experiences as you had.\n\n&gt; What went right: Everything. What went wrong: Really, nothing, or nothing of note. \n\n... puts it so well. I had one-and-a-half not-so-nice encounters, but they are easily looked over. For me, and many fellow travellers I met, it was a humbling experience, throwing away a lot of prejudices, one way or another. The rule of thumb seems to be: if you are in a situation where you don't really understand what's going on, you are most likely taken care off, and might again end up with a lot more food than possible. \n\n\n\n",

Her response: \"Don't be scared to tell people you are American, they'll treat you like a rock star!\" So I tested it out on the next person who asked where I was from (a woman on the metro), and she pulled out a crucifix and started yelling \"I LOVE AMERICA, I LOVE JESUS, I LOVE YOU.\" So I went back to being European for a bit.

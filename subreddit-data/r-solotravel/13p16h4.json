Every now and then on my trips I like to go to restaurants and I just feel like everyone is watching me (even though they\u2019re not), especially when it\u2019s quite a quiet restaurant.\n\nI\u2019m trying to read a book to take my mind off it. But, when I\u2019m eating it\u2019s on my mind to the point where I can\u2019t relax.\n\nWhat can I do?",

            "comment": "Eating meals at slightly weird times when the restaurants aren't crowded yet can help if you're feeling self conscious. For instance if you're in a place where it's popular to have late dinners you could get dinner early when restaurants are just opening but aren't crowded yet. I do this pretty often, though it's not usually deliberate...just between jet lag and active days of walking around, I get hungry at strange times.\n\nYou might also start with places that have a more casual atmosphere, like \"over the counter\" food.",

Wondering if you\u2019re an artist an executive a writer or some shit-hot computer geek.  Fake it till you make it mate, channell one of your favourite rock stars (or whoever) incognito.  \n\nWhen you enter restaurants / cafes, paste a big smile on your face - most people feel good about smiles, and respond well.  When the wait-staff clear your first plate, *give them a massive smile* and say \u201cV*ery delicious*, thank you!\u201d  Push yourself to gift people your kind gracious (don\u2019t lay it on too heavy lol) and friendly manner - it\u2019s a nice change from condescending rude demanding customers, staff will feel good and so will you.  Banish the nervous nellie anxious andy inside you, you can do it!  Fake it till you make it &amp; you\u2019ll be right mate!",

I had a friend who had a hard time eating in front of men, for the longest time. She literally felt like she would throw up before trying. Having a complicated relationship to food is not necessarily an uncommon thing, and on top of that, some kind of social anxiety. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will also say, there will be some cultures and countries where eating alone IS considered a weird thing. I know a lot of people here are saying, just don't care lalala, but if you are anxious about eating alone, for example, I would not recommend Korea as your first foray into that. I would recommend Japan. Koreans, in general, are very much like you, they don't like eating alone and feel embarrassed by it, and unfortunately, people there DO view people as a loser for doing that.",

If you are in Korea, in some restaurants people will absolutely stare at you and talk about you because so many things are group oriented. There is a tendency for people in Western countries to very much have an attitude of, I don't care about people and they don't care about me but in some countries that are more social and communal, they absolutely do. You can just choose to ignore them, of course.  But many countries have certain ways they like to share food that is not always conducive to solo dining.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, if you go to Istanbul, there are just some restaurants that won't seat you if you aren't in a group. Because the food there is meant to be shared.",

They will stop by other tables and simply skip me, and it's difficult to make eye contact or grab their attention. Even in my home town, there are places where the service just seems a lot better when I'm with a group of friends or family. But the worst are the restaurants that don't have a host/hostess and I'm not sure if I can just sit down or if I should talk to a server first. When a couple or group arrives, servers quickly notice and direct them to a table. But a solo person? It's like I stand there forever waiting for someone who doesn't look too busy so I can talk to them. That is really awkward.",

Enjoy the sights or people watch.\n* If the bartender/server speaks your language you can chat with them if it is not too busy.  Tell them you are a visitor and ask them for suggestions for things to do/see/eat/drink.  That can easily fill the time, and especially bartenders are happy to chat a little and brag on their city.\n* Use the time to write in a travel journal.\n* Plan the next part of your trip or day.\n* Look into more interactive dining experiences, for example: cooking at the table or Chef table/menu at fancier restaurants.  Ask questions and chat with the servers/chef about the food.\n* Get food to go and eat in a nearby park (dependent on where you are travelling), or go all out and have a picnic.\n\nWhatever you do, try to remember that people do not notice or care that you are eating alone.  Even if they did notice or care, you will probably never see them again, so why does it matter?",

Now well into middle age, could care less, and I always admire anyone esp the young ones who have the confidence and security to travel and eat alone. I make a point of visiting Michelin-starred restaurants when traveling and it would be asinine to miss out on those experiences while traveling solo.

And why should you give a shit about them? They\u2019re people just like you. Not one of us on this planet is a different species, and hierarchies are just social constructs. Imagine the restaurant is just a zoo filled with humans and you are one of the many on exhibition lol. Other people may glance at you as they pass by, but it won\u2019t affect you at all. We\u2019re all living this circus together, aren\u2019t we?\n\n2. Don\u2019t read the book. I mean, read the book if you want, but truly it just seems like you\u2019re avoiding your fear rather than facing it. Take your head out of the book, and **keyword:slowly** look around. I say slowly because if you look up super fast or quite obviously look around, people will be attracted to the motion. Count how many people are looking at you. Even in the most crowded rooms and actually especially in the most crowded rooms, probably only 1 in 30 people will be looking at you. And if you make eye contact, don\u2019t look away right away- you\u2019ll be surprised, most people immediately look away. Not because they\u2019re surprised you caught them but because they were resting their eyes, zoned out, whatever and you just happened to be right in front of them. We are social creatures- we look to each other in times of need and out of instinct. Over time, I think you\u2019ll become more comfortable with the idea that yes people look sometimes and no it doesn\u2019t really mean anything. \n\nI wish you the best of luck as someone who struggles with social anxiety and has dealt with similar feelings \ud83d\udc99 I hope you are able to enjoy the rest of your meals in restaurants in peace or that you will achieve that peace and acceptance someday",

Find a place with a few people at the bar and sit down with a single-seat gap between you and whomever you want to chat with. Skip any groups of two or more. Order a drink and don\u2019t read a book and avoid looking at your phone. Instead - study the bar, watch the bartender make drinks, take photos, or just listen in on the conversations around you. If you feel like it - strike up a convo with someone. If not - eventually the bartender or another patron will start chatting with you. I\u2019ve made a bunch of great friends and met some truly interesting people this way.\n\nDo that enough and you\u2019ll be super comfortable eating by yourself.",

I honestly can\u2019t understand why people think they look pathetic or lonely when eating alone? It\u2019s so bizarre to me. I feel the other way around! I feel on the top of the world! Especially when I sit outside on the restaurant\u2019s patio, people are walking past me, they are rushing to get to work or to get their kids to school, they look so concentrated on their problems \u2013 and here I am just peacefully enjoying a moment of solitude with a cold glass of Sauvignon Blanc, some delicious meal and an interesting book. How is it sad? It\u2019s only sad if you feel sad! The outsider has no idea if you feel lonely, anxious, uncomfortable or happy and relaxed. It\u2019s all in your head! You think people around you pity you when they see you eating alone? Well I think that many of them are jealous. Not everyone can afford to have a fine dinning experience alone for no reason. For many many people it\u2019s a luxury they can only afford for special occasions shared with others: dates, anniversaries, birthday parties etc. If you\u2019re able to afford a nice dinner out for yourself just cause you\u2019re hungry \u2013 you are damn privileged. So yeah trust me nobody sees you and thinks \u201coh look at this poor thing, eating this delicious meal all alone while reading a book, what a miserable life to have!\u201d\n\nReally, some of you people first need some therapy and then solo travel experience.

Eating earlier in the day, people dining alone is more common as people take lunch from work etc. What I would often do, is eat my main meal earlier in the day (ie, have a large lunch) and then at nighttime go exploring\u2026 if I want food I stop for street food, light bites, tapas, nibbles with a drink\u2026 if I like the vibe, I stay; if I don\u2019t, I move on. \n\nWhere you eat helps; pick places with outdoor areas, or music, or a football match playing, or a view. Practice mindful eating and enjoying your surroundings. Smile at people, be nice to waiting staff. Learn how to order a meal and have small talk in the local language - this absolutely helps when you are in a restaurant by yourself ordering food. Your ease of interacting with wait staff can boost your confidence. \n\nAnd more than any practical tips, the best thing you can do is adapt your mindset. As many have said, no one is that concerned with you being by yourself so this is really a case of the more attention you give it, the more you feel it. So try some strategies to get out of your own head. Become curious about your surroundings, read a book or do a puzzle on your phone, look at pics, plan your next day. \n\nAct like you belong there because you do. If you have to, fake your comfort. It\u2019s one of the beauties of solo travelling, no one there knows if this is a situation that intimidates you or not so you have full freedom to present whatever version of yourself you like. Some situations will take practice to be comfortable in (I still avoid restaurants that are full of couples) but take it easy on yourself and try enjoy your experiences, even the ones that feel a bit awkward.",

Some people in this world are struggling to eat at all. Just eat your food, and get on with your life. Who ever told you that everything is supposed to be so perfect? It's very entitled to believe that it's not normal that you might sometimes feel awkward in life. That everything is supposed to be fantastic for you. Just act like an adult, and do it. Eventually, you'll be likely to get used to it, and it won't be so bad. If it's that much of a problem, than find a new lifestyle that doesn't require you to do it anymore. Go home and eat with mommy, buy somebody else dinner to keep you company. Whatever. It's really not that big of deal. People eat alone all of the time. Some of them only and always even. Feeling alone and awkward does suck, but it happens, and you're likely to live through it! Here, you're very special, and I know you can do it! How's that?",

When you're occupied with something, you think less about what's going on around you.\n\nWhen I'm in a foreign country, I want to embrace the atmosphere by taking in the sounds, including foreign conversations, and sights around me. That's why I never put in my earphones while vacationing.\n\nAs for filling the loneliness... Do you use Facebook? When I traveled solo to Taiwan, I looked up events on Fb nearby. I found a nice comedy club and met both nationals and foreigners. I mingled and had a great time.\n\nIf you follow the advice given by commenters but still continue to be bothered by the awkwardness, maybe travel with a companion next time?",

Everyone's minds are busy thinking of their own thing. Here's a few tips.\n\n1. Bringing a book is a good idea yes or u can use your phone: Having something to read or watch can help occupy your time and make u feel more at ease. \n\n2. Consider sitting at the bar or counter: Sitting at the bar or counter can give u a front-row seat to the action, making u feel more involved and less isolated. It can also provide opportunities for casual conversations with bartenders or other patrons if you're open to it.\n\n3. Focus on your enjoyment: Instead of worrying about what others may think, focus on the experience itself. Savor the flavors, appreciate the ambiance, and take pleasure in the opportunity to enjoy a meal at your own pace.\n\n4. Engage in mindful activities: Use the time to engage in activities that u might not normally do, such as journaling, sketching, or simply people-watching. These can help u feel more connected to your surroundings and provide a sense of purpose.\n\nI think over time, the discomfort fades away, and you'll feel more confident and at ease the more u do it.",

Pretend you're the mysterious badass in the corner of the bar or something!\n\nI do feel anxious about talking to the wait staff with no time buffer of other people at my table ordering, but otherwise I like eating alone. I guess growing up knowing you're aro/ace from a young age just makes you used to dealing with the stigma of being unaccompanied?\n\nI do feel like there's a bit of difference in service, however. I don't think it's intentional. But for example, just a few days ago, I went out for a late dinner after work at Denny's. (It was about 10:30, but it was pretty busy.) Waitress was pleasant and helpful, but after eating my meal, she said she'd bring me my check, and then forgot about it. I tried and failed for 25 minutes to get her attention as she serviced every table (of 4+ people) around me, until I finally got the check and could leave. I consider myself a very patient person but by that point I was wondering what the legal ramifications are for just walking out after being held hostage for my bill lol. It might be because a single person table will bring in less of a tip with not much less work, or it could just be that it's easier to miss a single person at a table. Who knows, but it can be rather frustrating.",

You don't even know them! \nMy advice however would be trying traveling to Japan, there alot of people eat by themselves at restaurants, then maybe you get used to it\ud83d\ude02 \nYou can do it-----!!",

Regardless if they think I\u2019m a loser or not. This actually makes me more outgoing than I would be at home, and being a native English speaker works to your advantage here. \n\nTry to order and ask questions to the server in the local language and they\u2019ll know you\u2019re a tourist. If they\u2019re not too busy, they\u2019ll ask where you\u2019re from and strike up a conversation. I\u2019ve had many practice their English on me and vice versa, it\u2019s quite fun!",

The majority of my bar guests are coupled up regulars who are happy to talk to someone new for an hour.\n\nI\u2019m highly in favor of bringing a book, just don\u2019t expect to read much! Every time I\u2019ve had a book at a bar I turn into a magnet for conversation. It also removes pressure from yourself and others to force socializing.",

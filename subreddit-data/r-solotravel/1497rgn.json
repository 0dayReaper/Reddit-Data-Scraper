    "postText": "Hey guys, I have a surfboard with a large graphic of \u201c[the world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_(tarot_card))\u201d tarot card on the bottom. \n\nMy question is, do you think it\u2019s acceptable to travel to Morocco with this board or should I put a vinyl cover over the graphic to avoid conflict? I realize most of Morocco is pretty \u201cchill\u201d in terms of religious imagery, however, I don\u2019t want to ruffle any feathers seeing as I\u2019m already a tourist visiting to surf. \n\nDo you think it would be smart to consider it religious imagery and cover it up just to be safe or do you think it would be fine to have? Moreover, the woman on the card is topless and even tho it\u2019s just line art I am a bit worried I\u2019d upset some folks\u2026 \n\nAny thoughts?",

    "postText": "Hey there! I am looking for constructive feedback on my itinerary for a month in Europe. My job is hybrid but they are allowing me to work abroad for a while and I've been saving up for a couple weeks in Europe. Since I can work, I am able to extend my trip a bit longer and experience 'a day in the life' in a few of the cities while also taking PTO to explore and rest.\n\nWhen starting my itinerary the important things were Poland (specifically, Warsaw, Krakow, &amp; Auschwitz), Budapest, and some coastal/beach days. Originally I was thinking Greece but ended up on Croatia since it's closer and cheaper. And finish it off with a stop in Germany to see a friend before flying back to the US.\n\n* Day 1 - Arrive in **Warsaw**\n* Day 2 - Explore Warsaw - PTO\n* Day 3 - Explore Warsaw - PTO \n* Day 4 - Train to **Krakow** \\- PTO\n* Day 5 - Explore Krakow - PTO\n* Day 6 - Visit Auschwitz - PTO\n* Day 7 - Train to **Vienna** \\- Wkd\n* Day 8 - Explore Vienna - Wkd (pit stop to shorten the train journey)\n* Day 9 - Train to **Budapest** \\- Work ET\n* Day 10 - Explore Budapest - Work ET\n* Day 11 - Explore Budapest - Work ET\n* Day 12 - Explore Budapest - Work ET\n* Day 13 - Train to **Zagreb** \\- PTO\n* Day 14 - Explore Zagreb or Plitvice Lakes National Park - Wkd\n* Day 15 - Explore Zagreb - Wkd\n* Day 16 - Train to **Split** \\- PTO\n* Day 17 - Enjoy Split - Work ET\n* Day 18 - Enjoy Split - Work ET\n* Day 19 - Ferry to **Hvar** \\- Work ET\n* Day 20 - Enjoy Hvar - Work ET\n* Day 21 - Enjoy Hvar - Wkd\n* Day 22 - Enjoy Hvar - Wkd\n* Day 23 - Ferry to **Dubrovnik** \\- Work ET\n* Day 24 - Explore Dubrovnik - Work ET\n* Day 25 - Explore Dubrovnik - Work ET\n* Day 26 - Explore Dubrovnik - PTO\n* Day 27 - Flight to **Dusseldorf** \\- PTO \n* Day 28 - Visit friend in Cologne - Wkd\n* Day 29 - Visit friend - Wkd\n* Day 30 - Fly back to US - PTO",

Krak\u00f3w offers more authenticity and more to see. likewise I think Zagreb is not terribly interesting - but if you\u2019re using it as a base so you can visit Plitvice, that makes more sense. the coast of Croatia is an extremely beautiful place; you will love it. \n\nenjoy the trip!",

There are lots of great museums of all different kinds there, food is good and relatively cheap, a really pretty historic center and very easy to get around. Definitely worth some time!

    "postText": "Hello my passport is  able to get visa on arrival for tourism and I know that one requirement is a return ticket non refundable. My question is, can I use a multi city ticket? Or do I need to depart Lebanon and go back to the same country in flew in from? If the multi city ticket is on one reservation code will that be sufficient or will I run into problems at the airport. ?\n\nThank you",

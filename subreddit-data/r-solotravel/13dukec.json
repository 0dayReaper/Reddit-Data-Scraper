    "postText": "I had two weeks between jobs and decided to take a spontaneous trip late May to Portugal because I found cheap flights. I\u2019ve never been out of the US and have concerns that this itinerary is too busy. I also found it was much cheaper to fly to Porto -&gt; Ponta Delgada vs a direct flight.\n\nI\u2019m mostly interested in hiking/kayaking/everything outdoors so I think more time on the islands vs in the big cities is ideal for me.\n\nSunday 21 - overnight flight to Porto, Portugal\n\nMonday 22 - spend day/night exploring the city\n\nTuesday 23 - high speed train to Lisbon, Portugal and explore\n\nWednesday 24 - evening flight to Azores islands (ponta delgata). Rent a car and explore a bit\n\nThursday 25 - Wednesday 31 on the island doing random excursions\n\nThursday 1 - afternoon flight to Porto\n\nFriday 2 - early flight back to US",

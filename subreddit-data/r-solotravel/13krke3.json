    "postText": "Does anyone have experience backpacking in Shkoder, Albania? I\u2019m considering doing it instead of Italy, but I\u2019m a little anxious about doing it solo without a car. I heard about this leg from a TikTok and there\u2019s a beautiful hike I want to take that the hostels organize. However, I can only find one bus that goes there from Kotor, Macedonia and it\u2019s schedule is very sparse. It\u2019s also at the end of my trip so I need to be able to catch a plan afterwards (recommendations also helpful for which airport to use). \n\nI\u2019ll be separating from my friends after two weeks in northern/central Europe. And, I\u2019m also a bit apprehensive about doing in solo in addition to Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Macedonia. Since I\u2019m an American and newer to backpacking, I (unfortunately) feel safer in more touristy areas. I had a great experience backpacking Spain and Portugal with a friend last year but I speak Spanish so it was really easy and everywhere I went people could tell I was a foreigner and they were eager to help me, but I imagine southeast Europe is a lot different. \n\nFinally, is there any stress with border crossings since I\u2019ll be leaving the EU? Do I need to prepare any forms? Thanks!",

The hostel will also tell you where you can find other busses, I got one from Shkoder to Tirana and just paid when I got on the bus. \n\nAlso hikes aside Shkoder is an amazing place, I would definitely recommend staying a couple of nights.",

On buses: I went to Shkoder from Budva which is same bus as from Kotor. Only one service which left early in the morning (7ish I think). So maybe not ideal but bus ride was painless. On airports: I didn\u2019t fly but quite a few people I was with flew back from Tirana which isn\u2019t a far bus ride away. \n\nAnd on East Europe in general: don\u2019t worry at all! \nSlovenia and Croatia are/feel very western central. Safe, everyone speaks English, transport good. Croatia is tourist heavy. Def do Bled in Slovenia if you get chance. \n\nEnglish is understood everywhere (not till Albania I had any real language trouble). Occasionally little broken with older generation but no real issues. I adored Bosnia and Serbia- probably the most friendly/generous locals I met. More so that the real touristy areas in west. Not on your list but go to Kosovo if you want locals happy to see you! \n\nI travelled borders via bus- crossing really easy, off the bus/passport collection for stamps, then your on your way (I\u2019m UK resident). Serbian border always seem to do few more checks on baggage etc but your not going that way. \n\nI was similarly worried about trip but generally favourite bit of Europe wide trip. Enjoy!",

After that very much tickets from stations- you can buy online but be warned that even if it says E ticket some services need you to print them. In Montenegro I bought from station, Albania/Kosovo was literally on the bus. Can get hostel to explain, but near centre of Shkoder there are buses sitting all along road. Its about one a hour to Tirana, and depart from outside the theatre (if I remember correctly!). Pay once service leaves, don\u2019t think it costed anything significant.",

Valbone isn't really a town. No services or shopping.  \nStay at Guest House Hyrmet Demushi. It's up at the start of the trail and the people and food are great. They can do a pack lunch for the hike.  \nIn Theth, I liked Guesthouse Panorama. It's up above the town with great views. There's only so much you'll wanna do in Theth. They can organize your ride back to Shkoder.  \nKeep in mind that the deal you work with the hostel just covers the boat. When you're on the bus, they'll ask for more money. It's still a small amount of cash, but was confusing. I booked all of it ahead on the boat/bus website. A girl at my hostel organized through the hostel, and apparently they only got her the boat. She had to scramble for a seat on the busses.",

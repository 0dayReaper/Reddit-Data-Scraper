    "postText": "Hey all!  In a couple of weeks I'll be flying to CDMX.  I visited Mexico several times before the pandemic, but this will be my first post-Covid trip there.\n\nThis isn't my first time to CDMX, but I didn't see everything I wanted to see in my previous visits there, so I've got a few questions for anyone who's also been there, especially post-Covid.\n\n- I never got to see the Frida Kahlo Museum or Teotihuacan, and I plan on seeing both this time around.  Would you suggest a guided tour or do you think just a general admission ticket would be fine?  And where online would you buy a ticket for either?\n\n- Have any of you rented a bicycle?  If so, where would you recommend?  I know that Mexico City does have free bicycle rides on Sundays, but I won't be there on a Sunday.\n\n- Any hostel recommendations?  I stayed at B&amp;B Mexico Roma Norte last time, but I'd like to try something different this time.  Preferably someplace that has single rooms, is good for digital nomads and isn't a \"party hostel,\" and is located in either the Condesa/Roma area or the Historic Center.\n\n- If you've been to CDMX both before and after Covid, has anything changed?  In terms of safety, or anything else?",

            "comment": "For your question on tours, I guess that depends on just how interested you are in the places? Like if you were a big Frida fan then it might be worth your time to get a tour to get more information about the place when you're there. For both places I was content to just walk around on my own.\n\nI'd recommend getting tickets in advance for the Casa Azul. I haven't gone recently, but when I did the walk-in line was much longer than the ticketed line and it was a bit warm out to be waiting outside. I just found the ticket site from google. For Teotihuacan, I also just bought a ticket when I arrived and it was fine. Not sure if they had a separate line for advance tickets anyway.",

            "comment": "Casa pepe is a great hostel I stayed  at but on the pricier side. It has the option to be a party hostel but the rooftop closes at midnight and you can get a private room and there is no noise on the lower floors! The rooftop is also empty and quiet most of the day. There are also tables and stuff on the roof as well as the main floor where you check in. It is in the historic center! \n\nI went as a solo woman and felt safe post covid!",

Only caveat is that, just like you said, it's not the cheapest option so I might not recommend it to someone on a tight budget.  But it's well worth it if you have a little more financial flexibility.",

[This](https://www.boletosfridakahlo.org/) is where I bought mine. I did a tour to Teotihuacan through my hostel, but there's getyourguide too. You can also DIY with public transport or uber. \n\nI stayed at Casa Pepe too, and I enjoyed staying there as a base to explore CDMX for the first time. I also stayed at Casa Pancha. It was really nice, but too quiet for my personal preference. You might like that though. I didn't stay at this one, but I have U-Co Coliving bookmarked which seems to be catered for digital nomads. \n\nI've only been post-covid, but I felt pretty safe there.",

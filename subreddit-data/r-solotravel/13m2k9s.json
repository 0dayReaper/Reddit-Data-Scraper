Instead of meal prepping, you\u2019re making healthy cheap choices when eating out (super easy to do in certain parts of the world BTW) and getting whatever kind of work outs you can in. Sometimes you may find a gym, but if you\u2019re in remote areas, just knowing how to do body weight fitness that more or less does the trick is enough.",

One suggestion would be to research local parks or hiking trails in each location you'll be staying, and make a point to explore them. Not only will you get some exercise, but you'll also get to see some beautiful sights and maybe even meet some locals. Additionally, if you have access to a kitchen or grill, try to cook at least a few meals a week instead of eating out every night. That way you can control what's going into your meals and potentially save some money too. Good luck on your trip!",

I can stand by what I've seen a lot of comments touch on.\n\nCook as often as you can. East Coast hostels are almost not worth it unless you hit the jackpot as they can be near as expensive as a motel room. If you're camping bring a stove, take easy lightweight meals like oats and protein and canned tuna or chicken to supplement protein intake. \n\nBuy / bring resistance bands. Easiest way to have a workout anywhere.\n\nDownDog as someone else suggested is great for yoga. They also have other apps for pilates etc.\n\nIf you're craving a gym planet fitness is EVERYWHERE on the east coast. $25 a month for all club access. Just make sure you get the cancellation details right when you're finished up and you'll be golden.\n\nHike, run, and HIIT are also great. \n\nYou really only need 30 or so minutes every other day to maintain most muscle. That said I'm five months in without access to much in the way of heavy lifting and I've lost about 15lbs of muscle. Which I was expecting and am fine with. Six months is a decent time to step away. \n\nAnticipate and be ready for your body to change and do what makes you happy and feels good. Prioritize your trip and enjoy it. It's not everyday you get to do those things.",

You want to be exploring and enjoying the places you\u2019re in not worried about if you\u2019re hitting your macros and getting enough training it. It\u2019s easy to make health conscious decisions while eating out and opting for physically active tourist activities like hiking etc without wasting your trip inside of a gym feeling like you\u2019re right at home again. My SIL went on a two week vacation to France and BROUGHT her dumbbells etc\u2026.. that level of obsession can really ruin traveling IMO",

Cancelling them after your done can be a real nightmare sometimes and often requires communication with the exact same location you signed up at.\n\nFor food, meal prep is something you're not going to be able to keep doing unless you're staying in a place with a standard kitchen. When I was backpacking in southern Europe, I would get tortillas or pita, lettuce and tomatoes, hummus, and some kind of prepared chicken or schnitzel or sausage and make a wrap. Similar meals should be easy enough if you have at least a refrigerator available to you. But eating at gas stations/fast food places is going to be a pretty common thing if you can't get creative with inexpensive, low prep foods that can be made out of a small cooler or hotel mini fridge.\n\nHave a fun trip!",

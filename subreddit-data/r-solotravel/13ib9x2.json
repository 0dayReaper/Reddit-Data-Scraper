    "postText": "Hello there! I'm a part time college student thinking of solo traveling to Anchorage, Alaska this summer since I have heard that in the summer it is the best season to travel to. I have an aunt I have never gotten the chance to meet that lives there and I'm thinking of staying with her for the time being. I would like to stay there for maybe around 2 weeks. My main goals are to go hiking on any safe and accessible trails or visit any national park centers. I want to see nature as much as possible but in safe and organized manners. If anyone has any recommendations on places to go and see and how to get there or any fair warnings, please let me know.",

            "comment": "I was up in Alaska last August. Flew into Anchorage, spent two weeks down on the Kenai peninsula, 10 days up around Denali, and then for the last week of my trip I visited a friend in Juneau.\n\nTo be honest, Anchorage isn't a great city. There are some nice parts for sure, but they're spread quite far apart, and between the nice parts, it's very difficult to get around without a car. The city bus system leaves something to be desired and the city isn't exactly designed with pedestrians in mind. Before I left for Alaska, I heard a ton of mixed reviews about Seward, Homer, Juneau, and all the other smaller towns. Anchorage was the one city everyone seemed unified on: spend as little time there as possible.\n\nThat said, Alaska is still pretty much my favorite place on Earth, especially the Kenai peninsula south of Anchorage. I absolutely adored the town of Seward, but that's 2.5+ hour drive from ANC. If you have the time, I'd highly recommend a couple days in Seward. A bit closer to ANC, the town of Girdwood is just a 50 minute drive. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the town itself, not to mention the nature around it. Much of the drive down to Girdwood from Anchorage is decently undeveloped, with the road following the coast of an ocean inlet surrounded by mountains.\n\nMost of the Anchorage suburbs are north of Anchorage, in the Mat-Su valley. Towns like Wasilla and Palmer. The valley has a bit of a reputation (a state politician infamously referred to the people there as \"valley trash\"). I just drove through, didn't stop and spend much time there, but it didn't seem like I missed much. That being said, Hatcher Pass just north of Palmer is spectacular. It's one of the scariest roads I've ever driven with narrow twists and turns up the side of a mountain, but the weather didn't help and my rental vehicle wasn't the best choice for it.\n\nAll of that, of course, assumes you might be able to borrow a car from your aunt. Otherwise, you might look into the Alaska railroad. It runs from Anchorage down to Seward as well as up to Denali. I've never taken the Alaska trains, but I most likely will for my next trip to AK.\n\nMy last night in Alaska, as my Juneau friend and I ate dinner on the (covered!) patio of a water front bar, watching eagles as we ate, I made her promise me that for as long as she lives there, she would never take for granted the fact that her after work hikes and spontaneous weekend campouts are the trip of a lifetime for so many of us. She made me that promise, on the condition that I don't take a sunny day for granted. All that to say, when it comes to the timing of your trip, I flew up there July 29, and to Juneau on August 25. My first week and a half or so, I had gorgeous weather in Anchorage and the Kenai. After that, rain pretty much every day. Turns out August isn't exactly summer in Alaska, so if you can go in June or July, I've heard the weather is much less depressing.\n\nYou're going to have an absolutely amazing time up there, by the way. I fell in love with Alaska before I even stepped off the plane, and as I really got to know the state over the next five weeks, the space it occupies in my heart only continued to grow. Less than a week into the trip, I was already thinking about how I could get back up there. Alaska is a magical place, I hope you cherish your time there.",

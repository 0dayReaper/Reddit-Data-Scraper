For some reason, I feel like having some structure this time around and I thought about enrolling in some unique class during this trip. What are some unique classes/courses you experienced in your solo travels? (To be a bit particular, the dream would be a course that is longer than a few hours, but rather a few half-day sessions)",

The recipes and a video were given to let me recreate them at home.  I make the Spanish tortilla all the time - it's actually on the menu for today.",

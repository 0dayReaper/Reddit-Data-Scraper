    "postText": "I'm working in the US this summer, after which I'm first visiting a friend and doing a bit of a road trip in Utah, and then I'm planning on doing South America for a little while. I'm planning to fly back to the UK from either Bogota or Costa Rica (I'll work out that part closer to the time), but to start I'm planning to fly from Salt Lake City or Vegas down to Lima.\n\nI've been researching different routes I can take within my budget, I'm either going to do a straight shot north towards Bogota through northern Peru and Ecuador for a couple of weeks or head into southern Peru towards La Paz to get a flight up to Bogota instead. From Bogota I'll either fly home or get a cheap flight into Panama and go towards San Jose to fly home but again I'll decide on that part later. If going south then I want to aim to visit Cusco, Rainbow Mountain, Lake Titicaca, La Paz and the Uyuni Salt Flats, and I'll probably throw in one or two nights in Ayacucho to break up the journey to Cusco. If heading north then I want to try and visit Huarez, Cajamarca, Cuenca, Quito and Medellin, and I'll likely stop for a night each in Mancora, Pasto, and Cali to break up the journey.\n\nSo I guess I want to ask which itinerary sounds better, but also what's the recommended way to get around? I've been looking into bus routes and distances the last couple of days and naturally there are a lot of long journeys, especially for the northern route which is why I'm having to throw in a lot more breaks for that one. I did Central America by bus a couple of years ago and it honestly exhausted me so I want to try and avoid that fatigue the day after a 10+ hour journey if I can, or is it as simple as just taking flights everywhere to save time and energy?",

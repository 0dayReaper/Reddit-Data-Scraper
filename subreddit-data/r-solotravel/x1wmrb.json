    "postText": "Had a really shitty solo travel day today and I wanted to vent it out here. Solo travelling as a woman can be super super tough. I\u2019ve felt vulnerable and lonely so many times but you get stronger and stronger with experience. This week in Italy though I feel has been a set back and im losing all my confidence again. \n\nSo as stated im in Italy (Naples) right now and today I had my heart set on heading to the area by the sea (lungomare) id found yesterday to lay my towel, read my book and go for a swim and just have some peace. I went to sit on a rock id chosen nearby two couples and had a dip and came back on the rock and closed my eyes for a moment, when i opened them and looked up a group of four men were literally feasting on my body with their eyes (the rocky area I was is below the road and path so everyone can look down at the people chilling). They made no move to try and hide it, in fact they just kept staring while chatting. I closed my eyes again praying theyd move on soon enough and continue walking.\n\nThen i hear two small boys shout hello at me from the platform where the men were, they were very young and asked me the time, feeling safe I said hello back and told them and went back to my business. The next thing I feel is a hard can hit my face and pepsi splatter all over my body. Startled, I sat up and watched as these kids ran away. They\u2019d hurled the pepsi at me, completely unprovoked. By this stage there were at least 13 people watching (mainly men and a few women) who said nothing. My cheeks were burning red and the hit really really hurt. \n\nTrying to be as strong as possible i brushed off the pepsi with my towel, only to now see two of the four men walking towards me. They briefly said that what the kids did was wrong but then proceeded to corner me, talk to me for 15 minutes and ask for my number and offer me a night out (these dudes were well into their 50s and im in my mid 20s and they knew that). I lied and said I was meeting my partner.\n\nLong story short, i walked home furious and humiliated. Yeah it was a kid who threw the can, yeah i shouldnt care but in that moment i just so wished i had someone by my side so i could sink into the shadows a little more, be less vulnerable, someone to have my back. \n\nIm tired of being stared at like i\u2019m an exotic zoo animal in this country whenever I walk the streets. I think its still uncommon especially in the south for women to be out on their own without partners, friends or family and even though i dress modestly you really cant avoid those penetrating stares with every step you take. I\u2019m sick of being friendly and it getting mistaken for flirtation instead of just friendship and politness and the past few days i\u2019ve just stayed at home where I felt the most safe. I\u2019m so jealous of men here who can just make friends with everyone with no threat. \n\nI\u2019m also tired of dining out alone and men automatically thinking they can flirt with me and ask me out and its always men at least 20 years older. There hasnt been one time in the last few days i\u2019ve dined in peace. A man at a restaurant who was sitting next to me literally poured me a glass of wine and made me drink it with him while he spoke at me. \n\nI dont know how to overcome this i dont even want to go out alone anymore.\n\nEdit: wow - I am overwhelmed by your support. Thank you all so so so much! You don\u2019t know how much it means to just have this community have my back when I needed a boost. You all gave me the confidence and strategies to move forward with strength and i\u2019m ready to tackle another day in this city taking all your tips on board \u2764\ufe0f. Thank you\n\nAnd to all the men who are sending me hateful comments and telling me things like \u201cwhat do you expect?\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re attention seeking\u201d etc\u2026just let it go. Your comments aren\u2019t useful so just scroll past.",

Do something nice like a massage at a spa if you can, or a activity you enjoy that's in a safe space and makes you feel happy. Call someone from home and have a good solid cry too if that will help to let the emotions out. I think it's safe to say that if this happened to anyone else, they'd feel the same as you do. \n\nMy unsolicited advice as someone who's from a larger city that has random attacks on people, don't make eye contact. Don't be polite to strangers unless you feel like youre in a safe setting, not even kids. Its common for sketchy ppl to use young children to trick women into letting their guard down. \n\nIf someone tries to approach you, shake your head, firmly say no and only no (dont try to give reasons or engage in any further words because now they will feel emboldened) and walk away. You don't owe politeness or kindness to anyone but yourself, as women, we tend to forget that. If they try to slow you down by moving into your path, pretend to answer your phone and walk around them while talking. In fact, anytime you feel threatened or your intuition is going off, pretend to be on your phone. Theres even fake videos you can download that look like you're talking to someone.",

Southern Italy in general, especially towards foreign women but to every woman. When I visited Naples and Rome for my study abroad I got into many fights with the Italian men- verbal, staredowns, and physical (always protecting either myself or my fellow students/TA. I am not a violent person but I WILL step in and fight when people are being harassed/assaulted). My TA was sexually assaulted while in Rome and multiple female students were groped/assaulted on the bus (also in Rome). The blondes in my group in particular experienced the worst abuse. When the men are rejected they get nasty and violent, you need to learn to cuss in Italian and look big (I realize this is a privilege and not all women can do this). This is a very unpopular opinion (and I am fully expecting to be downvoted to hell) but I personally despise southern Italy as a result of this disgusting male behavior, I had a terrible experience there. It\u2019s a shame because southern Italy has incredible ancient culture, some great people, and is beautiful, and it\u2019s not ALL of southern Italians that are terrible (obviously), it\u2019s largely these predatory men and a particular culture surrounding women. My only real advice besides \u201cdon\u2019t travel alone\u201d (which sucks to hear as a woman, it shouldn\u2019t be necessary) is to get *very* good at self defense and fighting. Whether that be American style boxing or a form of martial arts. Even basic proficiency is very useful as men hardly ever expect a fight from a woman. Naples in particular is a very dangerous city, and I\u2019m tired of people pretending it isn\u2019t dangerous anymore.\n\nOh, and DO NOT WALK AROUND WITH HEADPHONES IN. Idk why people think this is good advice. It is the OPPOSITE of the image you want to project when walking down the streets of Naples, which is that you are a big tough asshole who is fully aware of your surroundings.",

I had met a local girl through the internet. It wasn't like that. She had a boyfriend. I was mainly just happy to have a locals advice. She was mainly busy, and would just tell me where to go, but we did meet up a couple times. One night she let me tag along to a party. Her sister's boyfriend was from a wealthy family, and they had this amazing place. Anyways some of the local guys at the party would come and talk to me. The mainly wanted to talk about American football. I'm not into sports, but I guess it was catching on there. When I mentioned I was from California, they were all blown away. \"California? The girls have blonde hair? Blue eyes? Huh? Huh?\" Well, yeah. Some of them. Then I remarked how amazed I was at how beautiful the girls there were, and they seemed annoyed I'd even mention it. \"But blonde hair? Blue Eyes? Huh? Huh? Yes?\" I chalked it up to everyone wanting something more exotic than their norm, but their faces would light up asking about it. I mean, California does have that stereotype, and it is somewhat true, but they must've watched a lot of Baywatch. They were very excited about the idea of blonde girls with blue eyes.",

Blonde is such a pervasive desire among Italian men that even Italian women have been known to treat blonde women (whether they are Italian or not) like shit (the blonde girls we were traveling with were always being glared at by non-blonde locals). I looked into and researched all this after the insane behavior I witnessed. I\u2019d never seen anything like it before visiting Italy, and I have traveled to many countries. I felt like the two very-obviously foreign blonde girls I was with needed bodyguards. It\u2019s insane to me because there are droves of gorgeous Italian women walking around who aren\u2019t blonde but are overshadowed and ignored. It is definitely some form of exoticism (is that the right word?) and concept of rarity.",

Firstly, i am so so sorry about the assault and harassment that occurred on your trip to italy to you and your fellow students. It\u2019s disgusting and infuriating and I am glad you were able to stand up for yourself. Men really shoot their shot here and somewhat believe they are entitled to have a woman and dont seem to worry about frightening her. NOT all as you said, but quite a lot.\n\nMy problem is i\u2019m literally a stick. I\u2019m skinny. I\u2019m petite. I am not strong and can\u2019t for the life of me fight. So provoking an Italian man is not an option for me. The only thing I can do is run super fast if I need to. One of my goals when I go back home is to get much stronger so agree in that i should learn some self defence basics.\n\nI can speak Italian, i\u2019m actually hear to improve my Italian and I fear telling a guy to fuck off will set him upon me which is why i default to just being kinda polite and moving on if I can. If I was in a group though maybe different story there!",

My way isn\u2019t always right, I just can\u2019t help myself personally and jump into fights. And you\u2019re right, being able to look big is a privilege and not everyone, male or female, has access to it. And you\u2019re also right that even if you\u2019re strong, a fight should be the last resort. Being able to run is the best option, especially if you\u2019re small! A lot of people freeze up when confronted, and there is no shame in that, but part of survival is learning to break that instinct and have a solid plan for when things go wrong (and if you are a small girl in Italy, trust me they will). Again I know people are well-intentioned but PLEASE do not wear headphones or earbuds, you will look like a much easier target for mugging, pickpocketing, or assault. Do not be polite, do not say a word to them. The second you feel something in your gut, that you are being watched or followed or approached, run or walk very quickly away, especially if you are alone. Politeness is a cue, and they can tell when you\u2019re being \u201cpolite-nervous\u201d which is what a lot of sweet and kind people do when confronted. I truly hope that the rest of your trip is a much better, safe experience.",

Yes, it sucks that we have to resort to such things but I'd reserve the feminist fight until you're not outnumbered &amp; in a safer space.  I mean, if you're getting assaulted by doing nothing then, again, I'm happy you were SMART about it.  \nLT Advice: um, join the feminist fight.  When you get back home, channel this energy into something constructive.  Let those \"men\" &amp; little brats rue the day that they thought they were dehumanizing ONE woman by helping empower MANY women.  Donate even a box of tampons to a women's shelter, march in just one campaign, or volunteer even once a year for an annual protest. Internationally, [UN Women](https://www.unwomen.org/en/get-involved) has a somewhat decent list on organized foreign campaigns.  I promise you, it's cathartic &amp; worthwhile.  In the future, you may want to travel as a political act.  I believe they march every Women's Day in Italy (March 8th). Maybe make a return visit for those mofos.    \nST Advice #2: It takes a certain type of mentality to act like this, so if you're internalizing, STOP IT.  If you're thinking, if only I was with someone, if only I was a man, if only I was Ronda Rousey, I, I, I, then STOP IT.  Those \"men\" &amp; those little shits KNOW you're smaller, you're alone &amp; you're foreign.  Jesus, all that's missing is a \"Vulnerable!\" tattoo across your forehead.  And it still took SIX of them &amp; an assault to get your goat.  If you ask me, that's pretty badass of you.  Back to them ... when was the last time you came home, boasting that you battered someone half your size &amp; half-dressed, terrorized an immigrant who didn't speak the language, or you &amp; 3 of your closest friends harassed a random stranger who was minding their own business?  Never, you say?  Hmmm, why is that?  I know you're feeling low, OP, but it could be worse.  Imagine being such a loser that you're one of those sad-sack assholes.  \nWe stand with you, OP.",

Still be careful obviously, but hopefully they will help look out for you a bit. \n\nBeing a solo woman reading a book is a good way to get approached at a quieter bar, if you want that. It also gives a fairly easy out if you don't want to talk to the person (or guy, if we're actually being honest). \n\nSometimes I will just jump into a conversation if something perks my ears up-- like if the conversation is about a place I've been or am about to go. In my experience, English speakers in non-English speaking countries are nearly always down for a conversation, especially if they're in a small group. \n\nNow, if you're looking to go out dancing... I have no advice. I've never been able to conquer my anxiety about going to a super-busy bar alone.",

I avoid going to the city if I don\u2019t absolutely have to, and it would never ever cross my mind to go to the \u201cbeach\u201d there. It attracts the lowest of the low of people, and by the way it is against the law, not that anyone cares about that in Naples.\nNaples is in fact a very rough city. I am a man in my 30s, 6\u20192\u201d tall, and I would not go alone at night in most areas of the city. \n\nIt is important that wherever you travel you learn some tips from locals or people who visited before. Normally it is just small, sensible things that will enhance your safety immensely. I have visited more than 30 countries myself, including places in Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America that have a \u201cslightly\u201d higher crime problem than Southern Italy. It wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing at all but the more I knew about a place the better the experience was.\n\nThe further away you go from Naples and its northern and eastern suburbs, the safer you\u2019ll be. The change is staggering, even in places nearby like Pompeii or Salerno and the Amalfi Coast.\n\nHaving said that, the amount of ignorant stereotypes that I have had to read about Southern Italy was tough to endure \ud83d\ude05",

You already know this but I want to put it out there that you have 0% reason to feel humiliated. They are the ones that should be ashamed of their behaviour.\n\nI wish this wasn't the case but I do try to appear aloof when I solo travel precisely for this reason. I'm always wearing sunglasses because it allows me to observe people without them really being able to observe me. The eyes are pretty easy to read so if there's a manifestation of shame or fear, the predators will go in for the kill.\n\nAs mentioned by others, wearing earphones also help to create that image of being aloof. \n\nI've also pretended to not understand what people are saying when I in fact do. Just to frustrate them so they'll leave.\n\nThese sort of negative experiences can be traumatizing. But by putting ourselves out there and solo travelling despite these experiences is, I believe, what sets change in motion. People need to get used to the idea that women are going to solo travel and that we're not going to let bad behaviour prevail. When I first began travelling over a decade ago, the reactions from family and friends were very negative. Now, there is a distinct increase in young women either solo travelling or expressing interest in it. \n\nBy continuing to solo travel, we are not just pursuing something we love and enjoy (barring the negative experiences of course!), We are effecting change in societal mindsets.\n\nStay safe and I hope your happy experiences way overshadow the bad ones.",

Those men were pigs and unfortunately they're not a rarity. You didn't deserve it, and I can see why you're discouraged, I'd be too.\n\n\"Centri sociali\" (like [http://www.exasilofilangieri.it/faq/](http://www.exasilofilangieri.it/faq/) in Naples) or other places run by transfeminist people are safer places if you want to relax for a while - generally people like the ones you've met are excluded and/or dealt with. Just be careful of and check what neighborhood they're in if you're on your own. Also I don't know if you know any Italian at all, but Nonunadimeno is a feminist organization which, on top of everything else, also promotes social events ([https://www.facebook.com/nonunadimenonapoli/](https://www.facebook.com/nonunadimenonapoli/)).\n\nSmaller cities and towns might also be less \"problematic\".",

Either way I can only imagine the humiliation you felt in the moment.\n\nI know that I had to grow a really thick skin while solo backpacking especially in countries where cat-calling is very common and where men don\u2019t feel any shame when ogling women. Honestly I don\u2019t have any good advice here because I just learnt to mostly ignore people who stare at me, and also whenever I see that some creep is watching me I make my face expression as stern and unapproachable as I can.\n\nDon\u2019t let it discourage you, girl. I know in the moment it makes you feel like crap, but just keep going because at the end of the day the good things in solo traveling outweigh the little ugly moments like this.

I ended up heading south to the Amalfi coast and stayed here https://www.booking.com/Share-z2jEZ4\n\nIts actually really affordable, around 40 a night solo with a good breakfast included. Its high above the coast, so take a bus to and from Amalfi, its about 2.1 euros i think per trip for an hour bus ride.\n\nThe beaches there seemed a lot more touristy and friendly. You can also walk east from Amalfi to Atrani for a slightly less crowded beach. Amalfi also has many ferrie connections.",

Of course I decided not to go and I guess I will never be there as long as this is the situation. So my recommendation, especially for a soloer woman, is to go North and avoid the cheesy weirdos guys of the south",

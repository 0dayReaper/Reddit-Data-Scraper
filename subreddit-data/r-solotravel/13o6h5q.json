    "postText": "I have been given the very fortunate opportunity to be able to go to Japan have had it on my dream for ages so when I had the opportunity to travel and got the money to do so I immediately thought of Japan. Issue is though I\u2019m 18 and haven\u2019t travelled before by myself though so am struggling with itinerary and what I should do while I\u2019m there. Went to Japan before but for the rugby World Cup so didn\u2019t manage to visit many places but went to hiroshima, shinjuku, shibuya, nikko, Kyoto. Some of these may go to again as didn\u2019t spend much time in them. Will be there 31st July - 15 august and will be flying into and out of Tokyo so will at least spend the start and end in Tokyo. The places I\u2019m interested in/brainstormed up are: \n\nTokyo(senso ji temple, sky tree, ginza, teamlab, harajuku, shinjuku, suga shrine staircase, shibuya, shibuya sky, asakusa, akhihabara, odaiba)\nDay trip to\n\nKyoto(manga museum, arashiyama, gioji)\n\nMt fuji\n\nShibu onsen-nakano (nakano broadway, snow monkey park) \n\nMaybe osaka(dotombori, Shinsekai, Osaka castle, day trip to nijigen no mori)\n\nFor background info I am a quite nerdy person, likes anime and tech stuff a lot but would also like to see some of the traditional Japanese culture and places and would like to spend atleast some of the time in the more rural areas and experience the great views and nature. Saying that though atleast at the moment the cities stand out more to me then the more rural areas so I will spend more time in them most likely but that may change. Would like to visit some shrines or temples but don\u2019t want to be going to too many as aren\u2019t the most important thing to me with the trip. Plus just seeing some of the normal touristy stuff as feel like you sort of have to. If you have any ideas or suggestions of stuff or places you think should be visited/done in Japan let me know. Thank you for your advice.",

            "comment": "Hi! I just got back from a 2-week Tokyo trip back in March so i'll add a little bit of advice based on my experience. Definitely buy an ICOCA card as soon as you can! Bullet trains are pricey so i'd keep aside about $250\\~ for them. Since you've been to Tokyo before, i'm sure you know that Harajuku, Shinjuku, Shibuya, etc are all in very close proximity to each other. I would recommend choosing two locations to visit per day while in Tokyo. Definitely visit Ikebukuro as well if you like anime/manga! They have an Animate shop with tons of merch. Sunshine City is also pretty cool. Since you like tech, each area has its own Tax-Free store with discounted tech items. While I enjoyed the time I spent in Tokyo, I felt I could've cut my time in half and spent more time in Kyoto, Osaka, etc. Personally, I think I would've had more fun in Tokyo if I had a companion. That's just me tho! \n\nKyoto is absolutely gorgeous! I'd recommend staying for 2-3 days and renting a Ryokan. Now...when it comes to Arashiyama, I would recommend staying away from the bamboo forest portion - it's literally a sea of human bodies and very difficult to walk through. If your heart is set on it, then i'd recommend going as early as possible. The surrounding area of Arashiyama is very peaceful and beautiful, there are many bamboo trees outside of the forest, too! Kyoto is more bus-based so try to keep that in mind as well. \n\nOsaka is pretty cool, Harukas 300 is an observatory, it is the tallest building there and it's a popular place to watch the sunset.",

With Tokyo tbf will spend less time in it then i initially planned as I feel I could get the bits done quicker and after more research there are definitely other places I\u2019d definitely want to go to. Initial plan was to spend the whole trip there but that has changed a lot now\ud83d\ude02\n\nYeah not too set on the bamboo forest so I\u2019ll give that a miss then. Will definitely still go to the area though as is a beautiful area.\n\nOsaka I\u2019ve been a bit struggling with what to do. Feel like I\u2019ll go there and just see what I find there atm rather then plan much in advance which tbf would be a nice experience. I will add the Harukas 300 though as a great sunset view does sound cool",

            "comment": "I will just throw some stuff\u2026all very touristy..\nTokyo need to go to kabukicho at night, also ueno park, yoyogi park, shinjuku gardens, the Tokyo skytree seemed nice although I didn\u2019t get to the top as the queues were immense.\n\nMaybe I misunderstood but Kyoto as day trip? That\u2019s too little. For me it was my favorite city that I visited. Apart from the classic Inari shrine there are so many others all beautiful, and the entire east side of city/higashiyama which starts at gion.\nI\u2019m also pretty nerdy but not at all into manga and the manga museum was completely alien to me. I didn\u2019t like it but again, this comes out of ignorance..but it\u2019s not really a museum rather a library will all mangas, obviously all in Japanese.\n\nFrom Kyoto I also recommend a day trip (&lt; 1h train) to Himeji to see the magnificent castle and Nara (the deer park might sound childish but they\u2019re really cool and hundreds upon hundreds, like pigeons in Venice..only slightly larger lol)\n\nMaybe also go to the Japanese alps to escape a bit the heat that there will be? \n\nBy Fuji do you mean climb it when season opens? Or the 5 lakes? I recommend spending a couple of days there instead of the classic day trip by train from Tokyo to kawaguchi. There are many buses that can take you to the other lakes. Even better rent a car if you can (will need IDP or Japanese translation) and visit them at your own pace",

                    "comment": "Yeah initially planned day trip but after some research realised, as you say it is not enough time. Will definitely spend a few days in Kyoto. The day trip to Nara sounds cool didnt realise there was a deer park there so will definitely add that. If I have time will see himeji aswell.\n\nCompletely forgot about the Japanese alps. Would be a nice break in the trip. I\u2019ll keep that in mind and do some more research into that. \n\nWith Fuji I wasn\u2019t too sure. Was thinking of climbing it as would be a cool experience but I don\u2019t want to be stuck in a queue up the mountain if it is packed. So wasn\u2019t too sure there tbh. A couple days would definitely get rid of the time pressure there though instead of trying to get there and back in 1 day so is a good idea.",

            "comment": "The alps are lovely, but it\u2019s kind of out of the way for your itinerary.  I\u2019ve done the alpine route- to see the snow wall, but in July/August, check to see when they\u2019re releasing warer from the  dam.\n\nThere won\u2019t be much (any) snow at the monkey park in August and you\u2019re looking a something like an hour long bus ride each way.  Contrary to most info, it is possible to pay for the bus tickets by credit card, but I did it by looking up the number and buying the tickets at family mart.  The relevant section of machine is NOT in English.  There ways signage about the bus now taking credit cards, but I wouldn\u2019t risk it with a foreign card.  It also doesn\u2019t take ic cards.\n\nSpeaking of ic cards, I used the mobile suica card in apple wallet and it was really great.\n\nIf Tokyo in August is too unbearably hot,  aquarium in Yokohama is pretty nice.",

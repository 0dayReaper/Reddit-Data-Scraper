    "postText": "Hii!\n\nI'm planning my first ever backpacking trip and am looking for some advice. It's to Thailand and it's six weeks. I'm 26 and coming from England. This plan is very loose; it could go completely out the window on day one because I want this to be spontaneous. I just want a plan I can revert to just in case. I've been to Thailand before but it was a one week holiday on Koh Samui.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**QUESTIONS**\n\nAm I spending enough time / too much time in each place (I know I'm spending a lot of time on Koh Samui and Koh Phangan... I just fell in love with Koh Samui when I was there before)?\n\nDo you strongly recommend any other places?\n\nAny recommendations of things to do in these places (I have ideas but I'm sure there's stuff I'm missing - I want to go on adventures, experience the culture, but I also love a good party).\n\nIs \u00a330 a day enough money? I've read a lot that says it is but most of it's from before the pandemic so I'm wondering if that's changed (a big thing to consider here is that I don't like beer; I pretty much only drink spirits and I looooove cocktails... and, as I said, I do like a good party). I've got plenty of time to save more if it's not enough.\n\nLastly, I don't drive so can't drive a scooter. I also can't see myself getting on the back of one because, to be honest, they really scare me. How big of a problem will this be? Am I going to have to face that fear or are there ways around it in all of these places?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE ITINERARY**\n\nThe below itinerary is extremely precise. I know it won't work out this way; I'm just using commute times from Rome2Rio and subtracting the commute time from the time in the previous destination... which is why it seems stupidly specific.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBangkok - 3d 13h 30m\n\nCOMMUTE - 10h 30m\n\nChiang Mai - 5d 20h\n\nCOMMUTE - 4h\n\nChiang Rai - 4d 8h 30m\n\nCOMMUTE - 15h 30m\n\nBangkok - 2d 9h 30m\n\nCOMMUTE - 14h 30m\n\nKoh Samui - 6d 23h\n\nCOMMUTE - 1h\n\nKoh Phangan - 6d 16h\n\nCOMMUTE - 8h\n\nKrabi - 6d 10h\n\nCOMMUTE - 14h\n\nBangkok - 3d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts? Thank yoooou :)",

On Koh Phangan you really need to ride a scotter to get around the island easily. If you really can't ride (and I don't suggest you learning on the island), you might consider to skip Kph Phangan and head straight to Koh Tao.  Regardless, add Koh Tao and I would drop a couple from each of Koh Samui and Phangan.  Krabi/Ao Nang/Railay Beach/Koh Phi Phi is really worth your time, since you have so much of it. Fly from Krabi back to Bangkok.  Your budget is probably doable, but it is always good to have a bit more.\n\nSince you are going for more than 30 days, you will need to apply for your eVisa before you go to get 60 days.",

                            "comment": "Generally speaking, kids learn how to ride scooters/motorbikes in Thailand at a young age from their parents/siblings, so there are no learn-to-ride schools (except in the city, I suspect).  Koh Phangan, specifically, is full of scooters to rent because the island is large enough to need them to get around to see all the various beaches and sites. It is too far to walk and there is little in the way of cheap transport options. \n\nThe short answer is: If you have ridden a bicycle, but never ridden a scooter, then you need to spend 10-20 minutes on a quiet road to just get used to the speed, how to slow down and how to turn.  You need to get comfortable.  If it is your first time, then it is best to do it away from everyone, so don't just rent it and expect to cruise away.\n\nThe longer answer is: Riding a scooter is not unlike riding a bicycle, with the major exception you are going faster. Going faster means mistakes are more disastrous.  Anyone who has been to Thailand (or Bali or Vietnam) has seen a tourist with bandages on their arms and legs from where they have had a accident. If you are lucky, you have some scatches and scrapes.  If you are unlucky, you are dead.  I have seen inexperienced tourists ride straight off the road instead of taking a bend.  I have seen low speed accident where they just didn't realise that the front brake was not to be used when you are turning on a wet road.   There are other accidents I have also seen that needed an ambulance.  Not only are you putting your faith in your own compentence, you are on the road with other scooters, cars, buses and trucks.  You will be passed by scooters ridden by 15 year olds on the way to school and they will fly by.  Don't be tempted to ride as fast as a local - you don't know the potholes, bumps, damp areas, etc.  Ride slower than you think, especially down hills with turns. Ride cautiously, enjoy the view and be aware of your surroundins (what is in front of you and coming up from behind you). Your travel insurance will not cover you, unless you are licenced to ride motorbikes and are wearing a helmet, so any visit to the hospital could be costly.  Always wear a helmet, never drink and avoid riding at night unless you are familar with the road.  Good luck.",

Certainly possible but tight. \n- motorbikes are the cheapest way to see a lot a places in a short period of time but also possible to get around without it, may just be longer and/or more expensive (if you use cabs)\n- as for your itinerary, i agree with other ppl\u2019s suggestions about flying straight south from chiang mai. Just easier for logistics\n\nI took recommendations here when I was there and found it immensely helpful  https://halfdigitalnomad.com/10-day-itinerary-in-thailand/ \nThey cover recommended budget, things to do, foods to try\n\nEnjoy your trip!!",

I may not be able to go into details cause its going to be an essay lol and i may get some info wron but i will try to point you to the right direction. \n\nRighttt here we go! \n\nBangkok \n\n- In Bangkok, you'll be fine. BTS MRT (train system), although it doesn't cover the whole area of Bangkok, it will be plenty enought for the major attractions. \n\n- Any other places that it doesn't cover. You can tke a taxi. Be cautious of getting rip off by them not using meter. Grab is an option. \n\n- Traffic jams in bangkok can be really bad. I mean like an hour of staying still kind. \n\n- Cultural place - Royal palace, Wat Prakaew, Wat Arun, Phu Kao Thong. Literally any \"Wat\" (temples). \n\n- Shopping malls - Icon Siam, Siam Paragon\nYes, shopping mall are a highlight of bangkok. It acts as our communal areas when we dont have a palce to go. So i gues this could also be considered \"cultural\" attractions\ud83e\udd23 \n\n- if you like nature, dont spent too much time in bangkok its a \"Concrete Jungle\" \n\n- People here speaks decent english if you need to ask for help. You will have to be abit slow when you speak and be patient. They are willing to help but English is intimidating to some. \n\nAll right moving on! \n\nI cant make comments about Chiang Mai and the North as I myself dont have much experience but one place that i remembered to be quite beautiful is Wat Rong Khun \n\nDown to the south of Thailand is where you will find one of the best Sea. These point will just be random stuff in no particular order. \n\n- I will suggest you to buy local tours to get to snorkeling spots or national parks (island) \n\n- Phi Phi island - visit Maya beach thatts the highlight get a 1 day all inclusive tour. Its not too expensive and i would say its worth it (At least when i went last year). They also speak good English. \n\n- If you have time I would reallocate some time in your itinerary from Bangkok to Phang Nga since you will be in Krabi anyways. Close enough i guess \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\n- I recommend Similan Island and Surin Island (both are in Phang Nga for one of the best diving spots in the world. Again buy a trip. Pay and forget. Trust me. I do it myself. \n\n- for these 2 island do double check the closure period (if i am not wrong they close the whole place during monsoon seasons) \n\n- there are 2 days trip which will let you live 1 night on the island if thats what you want. \n\n- Wanna party? Plenty of places to suite your need man. Its a tourist spot. (Although i cant give you recommendation since i dont myself lol) \n\nThat's\u00a0 what i can think off the top of my head right now. Street food are not too expensive. Expect to pay more when you go down to tourist area in say Phuket (that place is crazy expensive man) \n\nDo tip a little here and there if you can spare some. The locals suffered alot during covid. \n\nAnyways that was long, hope it helps. Enjoy and Welcome to Thailand.",

I just fell in love with Koh Samui when I was there before)?*\n\nI think you're giving Bangkok 2-3 more days than is strictly necessary. You could easily avoid the mid-trip stay by flying from Chiang Mai to Surat Thani (for Koh Samui) or Phuket or Krabi instead (lots of cheap fares on low cost airlines).\n\nIn terms of your commutes, apart from checking up flights, also have a look at trains. For instance, there's a great overnight train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai that can help you save a night's stay at a hostel.\n\nWhile I love Krabi, 6 days there alone is quite a lot. Maybe split it with another nearby island - Koh Yao Yai / Noi if you want somewhere quite with great views of the bay; or Koh Lanta if you want great beachs and a laidback vibe. Phi Phi is quite dirty and can get crowded with day tourists, while Phuket is pricey - even more so than Koh Samui, but you could consider ether.\n\n*Do you strongly recommend any other places?*\n\nSukhothai, halfway between Bangkok and Chiang Mai, is a lovely heritage site and far less crowded than Ayutthaya. Look it up.\n\n*Any recommendations of things to do in these places (I have ideas but I'm sure there's stuff I'm missing - I want to go on adventures, experience the culture, but I also love a good party).*\n\nIn Bangkok, check out the Palace and the temples, take a walk through Chinatown (great streetfood), and use the river- and canal-boats. Also, there are some great clubs in town - much safer and more fun than Koh Phangan, IMO (Khaosan is the seedier area though, go to the nicer ones around Sathorn, Sukhumvit, and Siam). Also, THE FOOD! From street food to Michelin-star fine dining, Bangkok is worth a trip for the meals alone.\n\nHiking around Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai is great.\n\nIn Koh Phangan, please be weary of scams, especially around full moon. Loads of spiked drinks and pimps and dealers floating about then, looking for witless young tourists to take advantage of. Also, Koh Tao is nearby, give the diving a shot.\n\nKrabi is my favourite because of the landscape. Definitely try out rock climbing here. The trip out to Phi Phi is a mixed bag - the island itself is underwhelming and Maya Bay is crowded af when the tour boats pile up. I'd much rather head for a night or two on Koh Yao Noi or Koh Yao Yai, both of which are quiet islands with great views of Phang Nga Bay.  Koh Lanta is a lovely, laidback alternative for a night or two with some great beaches. Phuket is also close by, but its easily the most expensive island in Thailand as well.\n\n*Is \u00a330 a day enough money? I've read a lot that says it is but most of it's from before the pandemic so I'm wondering if that's changed (a big thing to consider here is that I don't like beer; I pretty much only drink spirits and I looooove cocktails... and, as I said, I do like a good party). I've got plenty of time to save more if it's not enough.*\n\n30 pounds a day might leave you weighing costs of activities, meals, and drinks a little more than you'd like. I'd say aim to save atleast 50 per day instead, just to not compromise too much on your holiday.\n\n*Lastly, I don't drive so can't drive a scooter. I also can't see myself getting on the back of one because, to be honest, they really scare me. How big of a problem will this be? Am I going to have to face that fear or are there ways around it in all of these places?*\n\nNot a huge problem, IMO. For general transit, you can figure the local shared jeep system and routes. On tours, the agents will be more than happy to pick- and drop- for a small fee (if not already included). If you do feel like getting your own wheels, then a scooter is easy enough to learn on the go, or you could rent an e-bike instead. In Bangkok, the MRT and SkyTrain and Airport Express and the Don Meuang rail link will take you to most places of note - you don't need the cabs at all.",

Travelling is all I want to do with my life so this is far from the last time I'll visit Thailand. I just fancy more beaches this time.",

U can also haggle w taxi drivers just check app first and go above as much as u can afford. Bolt is busy in bangkok. \n\nExtend in bangkok. I guess u will go to khao san road. Backpack street. \n\nBkk has everything you need. \n\nNot interested in pattaya? Koh larn is a ferry away. Water is bearable. I went to monkey beach and handed monkeys bananas. Elephant sanctuary is there as well.",

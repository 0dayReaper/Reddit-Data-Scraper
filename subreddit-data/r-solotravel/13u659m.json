    "postText": "I started traveling in my late 20s, and then I started solo-travel in my 30s. I feel like I am behind the curve. I wish I could have traveled in my early years before I had responsibilities but financially it wasn't possible. Now that I have a decent-paying job, I can afford to travel more frequently. But because I have a job (and a mortgage, student loans, and bills), I can't do the backpacking through Europe or East Asia or any of the things that I wish I did when I was younger. \n\nWhen I do go traveling, I feel like I am out of touch (generationally) with the current wave of solo-adventurers. I can't just go out and meet cool people because I am slightly older (really late 30s) because I feel like I have no idea what they are talking about, and people my age tend to be (not all but many) in resorts or on family vacations. I prefer staying in hostels over fancy hotels. I have no kids and my income pays for my bills and then fun stuff like traveling and scuba. I am not a drinker so I stay away from bars. I have celiac so going out to eat makes it a bit more complicated due to cross-contamination. \n\nSo the question to you solo travelers, is what is the ideal age range to be a solo-traveler? When its fun, carefree, and yet still easy to meet people who have this travel passion with you.",

Now I get sleepy by 11 PM and I'm awake by 6 AM no matter what time I go to sleep. I'm tall so I have to take precautions when booking things, making sure I am comfortable. In my 20s, i didn't give a shit lol i would have been fine anywhere as long as I had headphones and my ipod nano.\n\nBut there are other parts about going when you are older that are great. I planned a lot more carefully, didn't make dumb mistakes because I had traveled other places before. Was able to spend a bit more so that we were in a private hostel dorm instead of sharing with 12 other people to save like 20$ a night.",

I just can't cosign the idea that solo travel is, by definition, not great over 50 and that in 36 months I'm going to start falling apart! I realized on this trip that I'm ready to use a suitcase, because my hips were really feeling my backpack weight. I will probably make other changes due to age over time. But this attitude of \"uh... because you're 50\"? Only if you let it will that be true.\n\nI have more time, more money, better priorities, more savviness, than I did during my first solo travel 26 years ago. To imply there's an \"ideal\" age to solo travel is silly, IMHO. It's just different. \n\nOf course, my 70-something parents sold their house 14 years ago to travel perpetually and couldn't be happier, so I have good role models in this arena.",

A lot of people aren\u2019t interested in the more obscure places I want to go.

A lot of times it\u2019s the waiters and bartenders. It is tough though being out in an age group where your watching people your kids age partying and your own age with their spouses and friends. I admire your non drinker status and you probably get a lot of benefits from that but when traveling being at bars and partying is a big part of the experience even if your just hanging around and BS ing with the bartender. Also being able to be flexible on food choices is big when traveling so that is a limiting factor beyond anyone\u2019s control. I would suggest seeking out more specific group tours like scuba groups that a do a few trips a year or biking groups. That way the emphasis is on the activity everyone can share and appreciate.

I\u2019m 25 with a generously paying job, which I find to be ideal. I can be out walking around Tokyo for 15+ hours a day, go to bed for 6 hours, and be ready to go the next day for the same. I think that\u2019s the best you could ask for.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re older you (in theory) would have more money and be able to do cooler stuff and pay for taxis instead of walking, etc. \n\nThe best age is now! Just go, figure it out. If you get tired, take a break. If you wanna go to a club and you\u2019re 97 years old? Fuck it, go! I\u2019ve seen a few old people at clubs in my home town and all I\u2019ve ever thought was \u201cwow, look at them go!\u201d",

Sometimes, I envy those people who have visited a lot (given the restrictions on our passport), coz back then, I wasn't earning a lot for me to be able to save and take trips. I even had to loan money just so I could have pocket money on my very first trip. It was with people, so I felt like there was this pressure to keep up with these people who know how to travel. I decided after that, I wanted to travel on my own, only because I could manage my own finances without having to feel that additional pressure. Looking back, I think that \"pressure\" was self-imposed.\n\nI can totally relate to what you just mentioned about the generation thing. Sometimes, I feel like the ones traveling now are probably the generation that I could already consider as my kids. Like it can make me feel really old sometimes. I imagine, people in our generation are most likely settled down with kids or traveling as a family.\n\nI think at the end of the day, most of these thoughts are just us \"thinking too much\". You just have to enjoy it. As long as your body is able, that's all that matters.",

Imo there is something more fun about going budget and quite often cheap choices like hostels are more likely to make memories but you can still do that now and opt out when you want a break (which I wished I could do sometimes). Like I said I've met all age ranges.\n\nI actually think in retrospect I would've liked to have visited some places while older because now I've learned more about them and could visit again with a greater level of understanding. Maybe there's an argument for energy levels but my dad's in his 50s and still keeps up with me when we go hiking or something.

I started solo travelling in my 30s too, not much of a drinker and honestly very introverted. I've made 2 good friends solo traveling, one is about 10 years older and one is about 10 years younger. It's not really about the age. Last year on my travels I met a retiree in her 70s who was solo backpacking. \n\nThere's no one way to travel or have adventures. If you really want to travel to socialize you would need to research accommodation (like hostels), travel experiences or tours that cater to this.",

But of course it can be still fun to go to pub crawls with the young folks, but you can go to an art museum too. \n\nYou don't need immerse to the young  backpacking community to travel long term. \n\nThere was one German guy 18 I met in Saigon and I asked him if his parents are not afraid that he is so farawag from home and he said his parents did the same. So why not doing what your kids will do in the future!",

It afforded me freedom to start and end my day whenever and more importantly, it let me save money by walking or taking the cheaper route/meals/hotels than consider what other people might feel if you asked them to do the same thing.\n\nNowadays, I find joy in bringing people to places I've been to and seeing their faces. I still like going to places alone, but after bringing my family to Japan a couple of times or when I recently had that island trip with friends at work, I'm kinda looking for that level of excitement in every trip.\n\nIf you're a family/social guy, you'd want to always be with someone wherever you are if only to not feel alone or talk about the experience you all had, which can make solo traveling feel a waste of money and more like a trivial bucket-list checking activity.",

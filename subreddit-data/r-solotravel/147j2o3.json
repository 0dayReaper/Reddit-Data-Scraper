    "postText": "I'm thinking of visiting one of the PNW cities for a month during the summer while working full time. I'd rather not visit both in a month because staying at least 30 days in one place means I don't have to pay short term occupancy taxes. \n\nOne of my biggest concerns is safety. I've heard crime in Portland has risen up a lot over the past 3 years since the pandemic. I can't drive so I'd either have to walk, ride public transit, or bike. I don't know how safe the public transit is. If I visit Portland, I need to stay in or close to downtown because that's walkable distance to the office (near pioneer courthouse). Be honest with me -- is Portland safe for a solo traveller and which areas should I avoid?\n\nIf I stay in Seattle, I'm planning on staying in or near South Lake Union which is close to the office. Seattle is also a lot more expensive than Portland. Fwiw, I've already lived in Seattle for a short time during the pandemic when everything was closed down, but now that that's over, I'm interested in doing everything that Seattle has to offer.  \n\nMy ideal summer is to enjoy the all of greatness of the PNW including nature and water activities in the great weather when I'm not working. I want to be able to walk/take public transportation safely in the city.",

It is really beautiful in the summer months and safety has gotten much better, but I will be honest there are still concerns. A lot of how concerned you should be though will depend on how familiar you are with dealing with homeless, if you\u2019re a woman, etc. What area you\u2019ll like best also will depend on your age, but I personally actually prefer the kirkland/Juanita area over Seattle. Seattle is super accessible from there but it\u2019s more the late 20s early 30d crowd than Seattle proper with still plenty of bars and restaurants, super walkable downtown area and great access to bike trails and you shorten your trip a bit if you\u2019re going to be going across the lake to hike a lot. Feel free to dm me if you want to chat more about the area!",

            "comment": "Portland *feels* sketchy due to the insane level of vagrancy but realistically you're very unlikely to be the victim of crime there, other than perhaps your car getting broken into. Violent crime is concentrated in a few bad neighborhoods and Portland homeless tend to leave people alone more than any other city I've been to. It's a great place if you can look past some of its glaring issues. Avoid Chinatown and anywhere east of 82nd. If you like Asian food go to 82nd",

The vast majority of homeless people leave you alone, they have other shit to worry about. Some of them will yell a bit (almost never at you) and they can spook you, but again: they're rarely dangerous. \n\nEven east of 82nd it's just really dependent on neighborhood.",

We immediately turned around and hide in the pizza place bathroom and thankfully a group of guys were outside at the table eating and helped fend him off. I was beyond terrified that this unhinged man was this close to potentially harming us fatally or others nearby.\n\nMy friend who I was with who has lived in Portland all her life and is also a therapist who has worked with patients who are drug addicted and homeless, said she\u2019s never seen it that bad. She actually just moved out of Portland this month because it\u2019s gotten to the point where she doesn\u2019t feel safe and issues like that happen to people too much. It\u2019s sad because I lived in Portland for a year in 2014 and while there was still homelessness very present, the aggressiveness wasn\u2019t there like it is now. It\u2019s to the point where the drugs they\u2019re on are causing psychotic episodes of rage and agression and it\u2019s unsafe.\n\nI live in NYC where there\u2019s a lot of homeless people but they do not bother you and I feel 1000x safer in nyc than I do Portland. It\u2019s ashame because it\u2019s a great city.",

If you have one unhinged person and 50 functioning people you are going to feel safer than when there is one unhinged person and 5 or 10 functioning people. \n\nThat being said, most of portland is safe. Anywhere south of burnside and west of the river is really nice. East of the river there are nice walking/shopping areas around hawthorn. 82 has really fantastic asian food. (There is a china town, but it is rough, and the food in the jade district on 82 is cheaper, better, and more varied.) It\u2019s worth it to visit Powells for a day, Portland art museum is having a Klimt exhibit. OMSI has an imax theater and interesting exhibits. There is a graphic novel art house. Public transport is overall good. Light rail and trollies are fast, there are busses that connect all parts of the city you just need to check what time service will be less frequent. Ubers and lyft fill in the gaps. There is a high speed train to seattle if you want to go up for the weekend.",

For food, it wins hands down. One of the big reasons I go down that way actually. It also has a calmer vibe with things to do but not as eventful. I still really enjoy it. Portland is definitely cheaper at least for staying a few night when I do. Food is cheaper + no tax, and I\u2019m sure living cost.

So...you might want to consider looking at places that at LEAST have a window unit in whichever room you'll be working, plus your bedroom.

Without too much driving / moving around. Can anyone recommend where to go / how long to spend in each place?

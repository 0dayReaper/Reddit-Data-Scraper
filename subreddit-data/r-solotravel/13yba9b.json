    "postText": "Hello fellow travellers!! At the end of this month I (24F) am headed to New Zealand for a year on a working holiday visa. \n\nRight now, my plan is to fly into Auckland and stay for about a week or so (get my bank account set up, get de-jet lagged, etc). After than I plan to bus down to Mt. Maunganui, and then generally make my way south as the year progresses. I don\u2019t have very stringent plans at the moment as I\u2019m more keen to go and see where I end up. \n\nFor those of you who have been to NZ, where were your favourite spots? Favourite activities? Things I absolutely need to know before going? I love to be outdoors, so I\u2019d love to know some good beaches and hikes I could go on. As well, I\u2019ve never been so far away from everyone I\u2019ve ever known (I\u2019m from Canada) and for such a long time period. If anyone has any advice related to that, that would be lovely. Cheers everyone!",

Unfortunately with the population density so low in most of the country, public transport and intercity busses aren\u2019t the most reliable, convenient, or comfortable. \n\nMount Maunganui is a beautiful spot for the summer with access to lots of other cool areas (Rotorua, Taupo, Coromandel peninsula, Ohope beach, and even Raglan), but the South Island is where you get all the beautiful mountain and lake views you see on social media. \n\nHave fun!",

South Island is beautiful but don't sleep on the North. Bay of Islands, Northland, Tongariro crossing. Piha/the west coast beaches are beautiful. (Raglan, Muriwai, Bethells, Anawhata). Northland has some lovely spots. Tawharanui, Mangawhai etc honestly just do your research. Talk to kiwis when you get there. Buy a car. You'll absolutely need it.",

From Auckland I suggest the beaches at Coromandel. Especially hot water beach. And then Bay of plenty. It's much more tropical than you might imagine. In Auckland, K road is dope, but honestly Wellington is one of the coolest cities in the world.\n\n They don't get a lot of international press, but Napier/Hawkes Bay is pretty amazing and on the other side New Plymouth is one of the rare cities with amazing beaches and mountains. Catch some live music in Wellington. And since you're into hiking, Tongariro is pretty much a must do. \n\nThe south is fairy tale land but the one place to really check out is Te Anau. It's the trailhead for pretty several great hikes and just the most charming place ever.",

            "comment": "I visited the Queenstown area and it's beautiful (as already mentioned). My goal was hiking and outdoors, and here were some highlights:\n\nMount Cook / Aoraki\n\n* Hooker Valley hike is beautiful and easy\n\n* The hike up to the Mueller hut is also beautiful but very strenuous. You can stay at the hut to see the sunset/sunrise from the mountain. (I intended to stay at the hut overnight but had to turn back due to severe weather. :( )\n\n* If you want to find folks, YHA Mount Cook was a great place to stay and is local to everything\n\nRoy's Peak\n\n* Has some great vistas and picture points, though they can get extra crowded as they are well-known\n\n* I liked the hike but there's no shade, you're just going back and forth up the face of the mountain\n\nRouteburn Track\n\n* As always, spectacular scenery.\n\n* You can book a hut for a multi-day hike, but they're expensive and in high demand\n\n* I did a big section as a very long day-hike and it was great fun even if I didn't get to see all of it!\n\nBen Lomond\n\n* This is the peak right next to Queenstown proper\n\n* Super easy to get to and great views of the city\n\n* If you don't want to do the whole hike you can take a gondola part-way up\n\nMilford Sound\n\n* Water and mountains, what more could you want?\n\n* I thought it was decent, not as absolutely breathtaking as some reviews will state, although it is apparently better with recent rain (for more impressive waterfalls)\n\n* Pretty far from most other things, which often means you'll have to take a long bus ride. Due to time constraints I splurged on a small plane flight from Queenstown, which was fantastic on its own!\n\nI only had 10 days to see everything so you won't have to be as rushed as I was - I'm jealous! There is a ton to see and do.",

            "comment": "I did a year working holiday in NZ and it was pretty much the best year of my life. You can get by just fine without a car, if that plan doesn't come through. Buses to get between towns and cities, hitchhiking is easy, and you'll meet many travelers and fellow working holiday-ers with cars. \n\nThere was a tipping point for me. The first few months I was thinking in the past- about home, family and friends I missed, and the huge year of unknown ahead of me. Something happened when I took the ferry to the south island. I stopped feeling any dread about the unknown and looked ahead instead of behind. In retrospect I can see that I began to be more courageous and embrace the magic of situation. The south island will always be special to me. I was exactly your age, too. Journal and say yes to all opportunities that come your way. \n\nMt Aspiring national park was my fave.",

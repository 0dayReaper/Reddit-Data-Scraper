Europe or Central/North America \n\nI had an injury a little while back and I am currently limited in the amount I can walk. All of the places on my travel list involve lots of walking or hiking, so I am at a bit of a loss for where to go. \n\nAnyone have a suggestion for a solo travel destination where limited mobility wouldn\u2019t be such an issue? I am thinking something along the lines of a safe smallish town near the water that attracts a solo travel crowd.\n\nOr suggestions for places that have those electric scooters scattered about for rent?",

A sailing trip never even crossed my mind, but I think it might be perfect. \n\nDo you have any tour company recommendations?\n\nI\u2019m back injury as well. It sucks, but I\u2019ll get through it hopefully soon enough. In the meantime, I need to focus on what I can do in order to not go insane/get depressed.",

The initial injury happened a few years ago but it came back to bite me in the ass after feeling good and pushing my limits too much again. \n\nThanks again for the suggestion and recommendations. I will look into it more and might shoot you a dm if I have more questions. I\u2019ve never done a group tour before, but might be the best idea right now.",

I guess my question is more about looking for a small destination place that doesn\u2019t require a lot of travelling around, so I\u2019m not tempted to overdo it. Some place I can just sit and be, and also interact with other travellers. Not a city and not to disconnected from nature. \n\nI have nothing of that nature on my current travel list, it\u2019s all hikes and crazy adventures that i physically cannot do right now, so I am looking for quieter suggestions.",

Most would have a bench or something. Google earth will show you the surrounding area so you can see if there's a place to sit. I am in CA Bay area and have found a couple parks here that are peaceful.",

    "postText": "There is an event I would like to go to that occurs on one night only in London as I pass through from Prague to Inverness. I don\u2019t want to shell out for a ho(s)tel in London for one night because they\u2019re expensive and I\u2019d be leaving first thing for Scotland anyways. I don\u2019t want to be the asshole carrying his backpack in the bar all night. Is there a way I can store my gear, go to the event, and then get on my transport without paying for a night of lodging?",

            "comment": "You could look at getting the sleeper train from London to Inverness to save on accomodation for the night, depending on when your event finishes - there is definitely luggage storage at St Pancras (10mins walk or short bus from Euston, where the sleeper train goes from). There might be luggage storage at Euston as well, I'm not sure. \n\nOtherwise if you're going to fly up to Scotland, it depends which airport you'll be using. For Luton or Gatwick you can store your luggage at St Pancras before getting the train. For Heathrow, Paddington is probably better. \n\nIt's worth looking at the cost of luggage storage though, because you may find it just as cheap to get a bed in a hostel. Depends on the time of year probably. \n\nPro tip if you just need daytime storage, the British Library is free to enter and has free, relatively large lockers you can use. It's right between St Pancras and Euston stations. Probably won't fit a massive bag/case, but anything that is airline cabin baggage size is fine. You have to empty your locker before they close at 8pm though.",

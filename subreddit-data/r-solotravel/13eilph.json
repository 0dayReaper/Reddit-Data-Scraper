    "postText": "\nTLDR: anyone know of unusual routes across the world, mainly Europe to Asia but anywhere if you want to share :)\n\nHey, \n\nI've always wanted to do a trip like the British TV show \"race across the world\" \n\nThey go from England to Singapore without flying.\n\nThey go through Europe to turkey - Georgia - Azerbaijan - across Caspian sea - Kazakhstan - China - Vietnam - Cambodia - Thailand - Malaysia - Singapore\n\nI know you can do a similar thing with trains Siberian railway.\n\nHowever, as British citizen I cant enter Russia, I tried to find info on border crossing from China to Kazakhstan and it says all trains have stopped so unsure if that border is being used. Just wondering on other routes similar, maybe even other long routes in other areas so we could catalog them.\n\nI thought of from Singapore up to China down through Tibet - Nepal - India - Pakistan - Iran - Azerbaijan - Georgia - Turkey home to Europe \n\nDon't know how well that would work? Anyone get any other routes I could take?\n\nThanks as always :)",

If you leave on a Friday you can be in Paris in 2h then catch a night train to Vienna, Saturday train to Budapest then night train to Bucarest then on Sunday night bus to Istanbul, so leaving on Friday afternoon you can get there Monday morning. That leaves 4 days for the detours you'll have to take to get to their checkpoints",

A visit to Iran or Pakistan will probably complicate future travel as immigration officials in many countries are suspicious about travellers who have been there, while visiting Myanmar is more a matter of personal ethics.\n\nOne alternative is to use a mix of overland and cruise travel. From London, you can travel to Athens, and ferry hop to Limassol, Cyprus. From here, a number of cruises can get you to Egypt's Alexandria or Port Said. Then it's an overland journey to Hurghada, from where you can take a ferry to Saudi Arabia's Yanbu. Overland again to Dubai, and then a cruise to Mumbai, India. You could travel around India for a bit, or continue on that cruise down the west Indian coast to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, and across the Indian Ocean to Phuket / Malaysia / Singapore. Unfortunately no major cruises seem to be operating betwen India's eastern coast and southeast Asia at the moment. The alternative would be travelling overland into mainland China via Nepal and Tibet, and then down into Southeast Asia. \n\nFrom Southeast Asia, you can even consider ferry hopping all the way to Australia via Indonesia and East Timor (although the last commercial ship between East Timor and Darwin is anything but predictable).",

    "postText": "I'm probably going to leave Paris on June 10th then arrive in Rome on June 14th.\n\nI would like to spend a few days in the Riviera to relax a bit between the two major cities. \n\nPotential Plan:\n\nJune 10th\n\nArrive in Marseille during afternoon and walk around the city. Haven't come across any \"must see sites\" yet. Palais Longchamp and ancient ruins seem the most interesting.\n\nJune 11th\n\nVisit les Calanques in the morning then return to Marseille and take a train to Nice in the afternoon. \n\nCould I stop in Antibes for a few hours? Would it even be worth it?\n\nJune 12th\n\nTour Nice. Again no \"must see sites\" that I have come across yet. Just want to take in the nature for the most part.\n\nJune 13th\n\nTake train to surrounding areas as a day trip. Monaco? Eze? Cap-Ferrat?\n\nJune 14th \n\nSpend a bit more time in Nice or take an earlier flight and get a head start on Rome. idk",

            "comment": "I don't know Marseille so can't help there, but the Eastern french riviera is one of my favourite places on Earth! \n\nI'd say stopping in Antibes for an afternoon is well worth it, it's a beautiful little town with lots of little streets to wander around, gorgeous views from the sea wall, and a bit less crowded and more laid back than Nice. Picasso museum is worth a visit if that's your thing. Nomads coffee is great and very friendly if you're in need of some human interaction (they have a little cafe and on nice days a little van by the harbour as well).\n\nIf you like nature, I'd suggest Eze as a day trip from Nice. You can take the train to Eze-sur-mer and then walk up the Nietzsche trail, it's hard work but really rewarding, a beautiful climb up the mountain and still quite easy, you don't need any experience or special kit (I did it last year in a dress and Birkenstocks). Eze is a cool little town, the botanical gardens are lovely and again have fantastic views. You can get a bus back to Nice or back down to the station if you don't want to do the walk again.\n\nSomewhere you haven't mentioned but might be worth looking into is Grasse, it's inland from Nice but on the trainline. It's got a history of perfume making (the Fragonard museum is free and worth visiting), and is generally an interesting and pretty town to walk around, again a bit less hectic than Nice. \n\nMonaco is good if you like F1, or if you're really into the ostentatious glitz and glamour, but it's incredibly built up and quite an odd place overall. If you're only in southern France for a few days, I'd skip it personally.",

            "comment": "Go to the cathedral in Marseille, the city views are spectacular. Plenty of tourist shuttles from the old port.\n\nVillefranche is an easy excursion from Nice.\n\nFrom Nice take a bus to Eze-le-Village, an ancient hill town, and hike down to Eze-sur-Mer to pick up a bus or train back to Nice.\n\nMonaco is worth seeing briefly because it's famous, but it's a tense and unwelcoming place unless you're rich.",

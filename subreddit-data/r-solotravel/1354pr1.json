    "postText": "Well, this is a title I never thought I'd write.\n\nTo get straight to the point: I'm (mid 20s female) traveling to Asia in a few days and have a layover at Jeddah airport. Will my nipple piercings cause me any issues as an unmarried woman? There seems to be a whole list items not to bring to the airport but I can't find any information that references intimate piercings. \n\nI am aware I'm only a transit passenger, so I'm not under local jurisdiction, but that may not stop anyone from asking some questions (and I don't have a lot of time to catch my connecting flight anyway so minimizing my time at security is preferred). My piercings don't typically set off any alarms but the list of banned items is making me a bit paranoid.\n\nSo it's probably a long shot... but does anyone have experience with this situation?\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your responses, they're all very helpful! It also (unfortunately) seems like my paranoia was not entirely unwarranted based on what I read here. I will be switching the jewelry to plastic or glass for sure! I'm still quite anxious they will be felt during a pat-down but I hope it will be enough.\n\nEDIT2: Seems like things are more nuanced after all! Actual Saudis and expats have indicated that the piercings won't be a problem. I'm still going to wear retainers (just to be sure) but I think my best bet is to trust the people with actual lived experience. I'll try to fly under the radar (literally and figuratively) and I'll make sure to post an update. Thank you all for your advice!",

Is OP a journalist writing articles for a large international newspaper that the Royal Family don't like? Unless the answer is \"yes\", then they are just another face, one of millions, who pass through their airports every year.

She is someone they don't know. See the difference?\n\n&gt;Glad you have \u201creal world experience\u201d in Saudi Arabia, I myself will never seek to achieve that. I have prejudice towards Saudi Arabia has absolute fuck all to do with their race, and everything to do with their absolutely abysmal human rights record and everything that goes along with that. And no, they do not stand alone in that category.\n\nBlah blah blah don't care. You should go and feed the horse you rode in on and continue to justify your own racism however you like.\n\n&gt;You can sit on your high horse and pretend that your \u201cexperience\u201d somehow negates the potential for conflict for average people, but there are plenty of anecdotes about conflicts with authorities in the region. Someone in this comment chain who is currently living there also says to just use plastic and don\u2019t give the guards any reason to mess with you.\n\nYou mean the Saudi girl who has also said \"they really don't care\" and \"use plastic if you really want\"?\n\nHonestly, go and give your head a serious wobble. It's a fucking nipple piercing. They wouldn't be the first passenger to pass through with one, they won't be the last. Why would they honestly care because one random westerner has yet another piercing?\n\n&gt;We get it, you\u2019re super cool with your totally \u201creal world experience\u201d. No one cares. The region is dangerous, and has a deserving reputation as such.\n\nWhatever dipshit, I know the region, you clearly don't. The region isn't as dangerous as you kid on, China would concern me more than Saudi.",

You must be white or Arab to be so confident in the safety of Saudi Arabia.\n\nLike many places, Saudi can be safe - especially with money.  But they absolutely can chose to fuck you up over nothing, and that happens quite regularly to random folks (especially Indians).  \n\nKeep your head down, dress conservatively, and avoid attention are all great advice.  My friend's been to 100+ countries including several during conflicts.  She went to both Palestine and crossed the border to Israel during the conflict.  She was fine.  I still wouldn't recommend it.  But you can absolutely get through most situations by following that advice.  If not, you're relying on luck and nothing else.",

With that said, I reject the idea any claims I make are easily malleable to the whims of my nations propaganda. I assure you, my nation has plenty of its own problems in its view of women. If you belong to a culture that vigorously disagrees with western values, then this is probably going to boil down to moral relativism, which there are ways around but usually require substantial effort from both parties.\n\nTo answer your question, yes, I have thought about the societal bias in western media. Which is why I use credible sources and journals when researching. If you believe even academic journals are corrupt, then we\u2019ll never find common ground. I did research before I posted my comment as I do with all comments that can be potentially misrepresentative.\n\nSaudi Arabia has made substantial progress in the treatment of women as human beings instead of religious objects. I think that is awesome. I also think it is important to be honest about ones nations current state of affairs.\n\nIf you still think my response is a product of western propaganda, feel free to share evidence from the contrary from whatever you deem to be credible sources. If when I read them I feel they disprove my claim above, I\u2019ll delete the comment. If that happens, I apologize for being ignorant.",

            "comment": "So I have had mine pierced for over a decade and I have been on many flights including international ones in Europe. I always worried about setting off metal detectors or even body scans for years. After years of flying I have on occasion set them off for the thickness of my hair or socks but never for my piercings. \n\nI would avoid covering them with thick pasties or a thick shirt/sweater because this always seems to set off things for me and could look like you are concealing a possible weapon. My hair has been felt up so many times especially when it is braided.  I have also had to go through many metal detectors in various buildings that do not allow weapons. Never set off a metal detector and neither have my earrings which are usually bigger than my nipple barbells. \n\nMy guess is that even if I somehow managed to set them off the assumption would be that it was the wire in my bra since it is not a lot of metal and isn't bulky like a weapon. If you are super concerned that I would get them switched out with plastic or glass barbells at a professional piercer to ensure your piercing doesn't close up. Good luck and I hope you have a safe and enjoyable trip. &lt;3",

So the question you need to ask yourself, do you feel comfortable enough with the response you planned out previously? Saudi Arabia remains incredibly prohibitive on what women can and cannot do. For instance, women can now undertake the pilgrimage to Mecca without a male guardian, but they can only do so as part of a group. Since you will be by yourself, you run the risk of violating their strict customs. A male relative is still required to give permission for a woman to travel even when on business, leave home or leave and  fly outside of country.  How will you handle the situation if you\u2019re questioned?  You better be prepared.",

I have specifically been to Riyadh &amp; Mecca.\n\nWhile there on one trip, I witnessed some of my female colleagues arrested for being outside of the hotel and not having a male family member present.\n\nI saw a police officer backhand a woman who was begging on the corner of the street, trying to sell a handful of nuts.\n\nWhen giving a talk on stage in Riyadh, the audience was segregated with a curtain: women on one side, women get a tiny TV on their side, men get \"the big screen,\" and women were not allowed to ask questions until the men left. For what it's worth, the audience members seemed wonderful, and many were students; the broader configuration was the thing that was unsettling.\n\nAll that is to say: don't give anyone there a \"reason\" to analyze your chest, or any other part of your body.\n\nThe comment from u/Putrid_Effective_201 rings true.

THe rules said if you transit less than 12h no visa required.\n\nThey were soldiers at airport and intimidated us and cave in.Then we went to check-in and the saudi manager there tried to reject us onboarding because he didn't knew the rules regarding e-Visa for India, all of them were clueless of the rules and nobody knew the rules, it was a huge incompetency where everyone was employed on nepotism, a huge Kafka Nightmare.\n\nWe were treated horribly by that saudi man/manager with a psycho smug on his face, trying to sabotage our 2weeks holiday in India.Police was involved too, trying to scare us. It was traumatic, they were horrible to us, in the end they   called to Mumbai and the people there said our visas are ok. It was an hour of nightmare, we were worried of missing flight, getting stuck in this hostile country and ruining our holiday.\n\nWe explained to them multiple times  bcs covid there's e visa now, but the idiot couldn't believe us even after showing him the India Govt page.  \nYeah and this wasnt the end, I was hold up at security, a fucking again bcs the visa they gave me 3h before was not readable ffs.\n\nThe most awful experience ever. We swore never to get back!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah come with the downvotes, SA the country who cut into pieces a journalist in the embassy ffs!",

When I visited Saudi Arabia in 2020 female and male travellers were treated equally poorly at the badly-run Jeddah Airport, and the genders weren't separated except in the security screening line.

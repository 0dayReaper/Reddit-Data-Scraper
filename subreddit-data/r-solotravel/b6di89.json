    "postText": "One year ago tomorrow my husband of 19 years told me he wanted a divorce, to be honest I was relieved. One of the things we didn\u2019t have in common was that I had a strong yearning to travel and he didn\u2019t see it as a priority. I have always wanted to go to the UK and when we were selling our house all I could think of was the trip I was going to take when I got my proceeds from the house. Fast forward, we lost the house and there was no money. There went my dream.\n\nOur divorce was just finalized and I had another birthday and I\u2019ve been feeling the itch. Every so often I look at the airfares to London and quickly close the website knowing I can\u2019t possibly afford it. Today I looked at the fares and found a great deal! I booked it!! I am going to London in 177 days!!\n\nThank you for reading I just has to tell someone!",

I've been to London so many times now solo since I was 14 and I've never once had issues other than coming out of Covent Garden and a kid asking if I had the money whilst handing me a baggie of coke he realised it wasn't me he was looking for and ran off.\n\nIf you're just sticking to Central London and planning on doing some of the touristy things at dark, Tower Bridge etc. then you'll be fine.\n\nIf you look like a local, and act like a local you'll again be fine mostly. Don't look/act like a tourist, same goes for everywhere (city wise anyway) you go though. Don't bring attention to yourself.\n\nThere's an awful lot of people going around on their own in London and you'll blend in perfectly fine.\n\nLondon is just as safe at night as it is in the day (in fact I'd argue it's safer at night)",

Check if Sunday Backpackers near Kings Cross is still a thing.  Goto Camden Market on Sat/Sun, and the other markets too.\nLondon is very safe.  Alone at night is fine.  Don\u2019t act like a mark.  Stay out of the poorer areas.  Almost rolls up at night after 12 though.  Each area is almost a village unto itself.  It is a fantastic city.  Ride the buses as well as the tube, you\u2019ll see a ton from the upper deck.  Most locals are very friendly.\nI\u2019m from Texas, London is my 2nd home when I can visit.  I\u2019ll edit this post with my travel rec. if I can find it.\n\n....\n\nLondon is perfect.  If you are fit, climb to the top of St. Paul.  Use the Tube and bus and taxi.  You can walk for miles in London.  My favs are Oxford St.  from Tottenham Ct Rd to Notting Hill. and London Bridge to waterloo bridge south side and Waterloo bridge to Westminster bridge north side of the Thames.  So much to see and do here, and lots of backpackers to chat with.\n\nFor more recommendations and pubs, see my comments in this post [London to do](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/a252lm/comment/eaw19n5?st=JTS6E0EB&amp;sh=06fbd0f8) \n\n",

There are always so many people around, even at night, you never feel alone. To be safe, stick to well lit areas, be sure that you're aware of your bag if you're carrying one (don't leave it unattended or unzipped, tuck it under the table by your feet and where you can see it when you put it down), keep phone and wallet in pocket/bag etc. But this is just being street/travel smart. London is an amazing city and so much to offer both day and night. Make sure you grab it by the horns, don't be afraid and you'll have an amazing time!! ",

Go travel, go explore, have fun. I\u2019m traveling to London too  in May and I\u2019m super excited but also nervous. I\u2019ve been planning a trip for three years but never had the courage to do so, until I told myself \u201cstop being a coward and book it\u201d. \nHope all goes well in your travels! ",

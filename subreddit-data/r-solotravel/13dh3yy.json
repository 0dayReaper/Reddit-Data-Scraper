    "postText": " 28 M I was previously planning a trip a few months before COVID but unfortunately fizzled out. Now almost 5 years later I'm thinking about traveling again. I'm in a job I enjoy but has no future so before I swap to hopefully what will be my career I'm thinking about a 6-12 month trek across Europe. I have a base route of some place to go but I'm debating whether or not to wing as I go or to plan most of it out. Looking to maybe leave April 2024 and depending on how much money i can save see how long i can go. I spent a week in UK previously kinda winging it but this is on a whole different scale. \n\nIf you have done something like this maybe you can answer some of these questions\n\nin the basically year leading up anything i should really do other then try to get in good physical shape and save money? what did you preplan? What did you do when you finished, how was reintegration To your old life?  How much did it cost? Euro rail or not?  Why did you want to travel?  How was it when you weren't doing something? \n\nAnything else you feel is worth knowing let me know",

            "comment": "The visa situation is one thing to consider. Unless if you're an EU citizen, you can only spend 90 days in the Schengen zone of Europe without a visa. If you intend to stay for longer than 90 days you'd need to apply for a visa, or plan your trip to spend 90 days in the Schengen zone and the rest of the trip in countries outside the Schengen zone. There are issues with trying to re-enter the Schengen zone too quickly after using up a 90 day visa-free visit so that's something to think about logistically as well.",

            "comment": "I did a year in Europe. \n\nMy lifestyle focuses around travel. So I'd work for about a year to a year and a half, live EXTREMELY frugally, save a shit ton of money, then quit and travel for an extended period of time. It's not for everyone but it works for me. I made sacrifices for a bigger goal without instant gratification. \n\nIt's also important to be in outstanding standing with your old employers. All my old jobs want me back, and I have a secure safety net of jobs when I come home. The only problem here is applying for a new job. Once in a while I'll have employers ask why I have a year gap in my resume, and it's 50/50 on whether they like that I traveled for that long. Usually they're concerned about commitment. But like I said before I usually work for 1-1.5 yrs and I have a long list of recommendations behind me.\n\nAs for cost I don't really remember. It was a little cheaper than being in the US due to no tipping culture. But damn near the same. I saved a lot of money by cooking a lot.\n\nThe times and economy is also different. When I went it was cheaper, and more convenient, to fly or bus than Euro rail. You'll have to do your own research tho.\n\nWhy do I travel? Travel has been my lifestyle for my early to late 20s. After I graduated college I was burnt out from academia and knew I didn't want to immediately fk my life away in a career. Mentors and professors told me I have 60 years ahead of me to figure sht out and that put things into perspective for me. So I traveled and got addicted to seeing how big the world is. Meeting and connecting with different people is an amazing experience and has had a big influence on my development as a human and perspective on life. \n\nI think it takes an especially special person who gets outside of their bubble, spend thousands of dollars to travel across the world, to a different country with different language and different culture, and immerse themselves in it. It's uncomfortable and it's humbling. Those people are special and some of the best people you'll ever meet in the world.",

Would you cook a big breakfast then use the leftovers for lunch?\n\nHow was your experience sharing refrigerators at hostels? \n\nI would very much appreciate if you share your strategies/tips for cooking/storing food while on the go!\n\nWas there a specific recipe that was the easiest to cook, easiest to store, etc?\n\nWhat kind of Tupperware were you using? Water tight seal?\n\nThank you!",

So generally I'll try most of the typical foods once, and if it's an expensive country, I'll try to learn and recreate those dishes. Makes for good conversation with the locals as well when you ask them how to make certain dishes.\n\nMy #1 protip is when you order food from a restaurant to ask for extra sauce or salsa or whatever and bring that back to cook with. Gives you restaurant flavors when you cook without having to do it yourself.\n\nAlso keep or ask for the togo boxes. This will save you money instead of having to buy Tupperware. But I generally cook enough for myself without having left overs.\n\nRefrigerators are rough. Make sure you keep or ask for grocery bags when you shop to protect your food. Even if you buy one item, you need the bag. I usually take a preventative approach and try not to cook too much so I avoid the refrigerator problem. I suggest you try to get your portions right and do the same.\n\nFor groceries search or ask for the bargain markets or farmers markets. You'll save money. Usually they're away from the city center. Which is where you always want to be for food. It's cheaper, authentic, and the local experience you want. Everything in the center are generally going to be overpriced tourist traps.\n\nFor things like oil and seasonings, try seeing if you can get a couple people to split the costs of them with you. Nobody is going to use that much oil or seasonings within there stay so it's beneficial for everyone to split the cost.\n\nPasta by far is the easiest and one of the cheapwst dishes to make. But like I said, I don't travel and spend all that money to eat the same thing I do at home. So I try my best to recreate the popular dishes in the country I'm in.",

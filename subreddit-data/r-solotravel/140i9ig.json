    "postText": "I\u2019m currently staying in a hostel  (western Europe) where, for the last two nights, one guy in our dorm will wake up once or twice between 3 and 6am, wash his face or hands or something, and start whispering while sitting/lying in the middle of the dorm.\n\nHe\u2019s not incredibly loud about it but loud enough to wake multiple people up in our dorm. No one else has commented AFAIK. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s either something religious or the guy is just nuts; is it insensitive to ask him to do it later or ask him to go outside or something?",

I know several religions really like to push the concept that prayers need to be spoken out loud.  It's seriously not the end of the world to do it silently in your head from time to time in the name of common courtesy though.\n\nHonestly, it would probably cause more noise for him to leave the room.  IME, hostel doors can rarely be opened and closed quietly.  Lol!  You are absolutely within your rights to politely ask him to be quieter though.",

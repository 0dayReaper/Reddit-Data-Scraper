I am used to budgeting and wiser with money but in my case, dont really want to think about money so much but I definitely don't want to spend a fortune. \n\nJust thought about all-inclusive resorts lately and like to know any thoughts from fellow solo travelers. Im used to hostels so pretty much guarantee meeting people who are also adventurous but resorts on the other hand seem too different. \n\nI also like to know which resort to go to. I dont mind pretty much anywhere in Latin countries. Cancun is a bit overrated to me.\n\nI should note that I don't mind being alone but I don't mind having the option to meet people",

            "comment": "I travel to The Caribbean solo often and love it. Depends on my mood if I want to meet people and hang out or be on my own, both are easy to do. If you want to meet people and hang out I would suggest a larger resort with more people, more options.\n\nMy usually days are get up for a morning beach walk, get a bite of breakfast, back to the room to get beach gear. Beach for the day, maybe doing a Zumba class, yoga, dance class on the beach. I walk the beach many times a day, I get tired of laying, like the exercise and it makes my tan more even. Lunch then more of the same. Leave the beach around 4-6, back to the room for a shower and maybe a nap. Cocktails, dinner then maybe the show or hang out in the lobby people watching, disco on the nights I feel like it. Most resorts have lots of tour options you can book if you want to explore.\n\nMore often than not when I travel solo I go to Cuba where the single supplements are much less than other places. Have gone solo to Punta Cana, Jamaica and Playa Del Carmen.",

I like not having to always worry about someone else, what they want, it's all about me. Gives me a chance to really think things through when Im going through a really tough spot. \n\nI always end up meeting people, I find it really easy. You get chatting with people at the beach bar, during one of the activities, sitting next to people in the lobby, swim up pool bar is a great spot to mingle. A couple of trips ago I hung out almost my entire week with a couple and 3 other singles, closing the bar most nights.  Last trip I needed/wanted time on my own and socialized much less but that was my choice.",

Riu Republica was good too, not as nice (in my opinion) as Majestic's but it was good and fun. They have a waterslides which seems to draw a larger crowd of 20-30 year olds than the Majestic properties. Riu was more party atmosphere .\n\nIn Jamaica I stayed solo at Riu Negril which is actually on Bloody Bay. The property is kinda meh but Jamaica is a ton of fun. Do be careful if you go, I was grabbed by a huge dude on a solo beach walk one morning. I love the people, food and music in Jamaica but I found that you have to be much more aware as a solo woman than in other destinations. I have stayed in Montego Bay and Runaway Bay as well (not solo) and found the beaches to be not near as nice as Negril, Bloody Bay, Punta Cana or Cuba.",

I always walk close to the water (away from trees and stuff so I can see who is hanging around )  and am very aware of my surroundings. It was a narrow area where the water was close to the mangroves and dude just came out and grabbed me by my arms and was dragging me back to the mangroves. I was fighting and screaming, my fighting made no difference whatsoever, dude was strong and probably 2x bigger than me. Some other tourists in the distance saw what was going on and a people started running my way yelling so dude let me go and took off. \n\nNormal beach walks I would be approached a lot. The weed guys were great, they warned away the hard druggies that tried to follow me. They must have still been sleeping that morning but they knew all about it by the afternoon.",

It's very purpose-driven.\n\nYou wake up, eat at the communal dining room, and then spend the bulk of the day diving, with a break for lunch, until a communal dinner.  There are often evening activities scheduled that you can join, or you can go into town and hang out there.  Usually folks will invite you along if you're alone.  It's basically a week long dive bonanza and, if you're a dedicated scuba diver, it's paradise!\n\nAs a solo traveler, I never had any trouble finding friends there, either.  But that's made easier because everyone shares a common interest: diving.  Most evenings were spent talking about our dives, what we saw, or where else we've been diving.  You get to know the people on your assigned boat really well, too.  I've made good and long-lasting friends that way.\n\nI've never done any generic all-inclusives, like beach resorts or similar, though.  So I can't comment on the experience there.",

Their pool is amazing and they have their own restaurant and bar so it feels almost more like a resort (the rooms are mediocre) rather than an hostel.\nI was traveling at a time that international tourism was extremely low in peru, and mancora is fairly off the beaten path so it was full of Peruvian couples (who would have thought Peruvians in peru!) rather than backpackers.\nI broke up with my gf right before going to peru so i was probably not in the right headspace for that place.

You can go sightseeing but it is pointless paying to have endless Food and facilities and End up not using them. \n\nI would consider it however to have 2-3 relaxing days nor worrying about anything regarding Food, drinks, transport or If there is some affordable package deal that it pays off more to base yourself in all inclusive and go on trips rather then booking ticket and some local acommodation separately. Or in places where there is not much to explore and there is not much decent local acommodation.",

Personally not super into meeting people, mostly just because I\u2019m much too shy, but I have talked to a few people here already. The all inclusive I\u2019m at is definitely geared towards couples, but not so much so that I feel completely out of place.

            "comment": "I went to an all-inclusive in Puerto Vallarta last year. I had a great time although I probably will not do one again in the future. The food and beverage options, although satisfying, were not interesting. They're basically meant to appeal to everybody. The resort had bands playing every other night, but besides this, there wasn't anything else by way of entertainment.\n\nI was bored on my third day that I took an Uber to downtown and explored. I met fellow solo travelers, I ate at Mexican restaurants, and had a better experience overall. Obviously, because I was staying at an all-inclusive, I couldn't invite the people I met to hang out at my resort's beach (unless they bought a day pass). What we ended up doing is to just meet in the evenings to have dinner and have a couple of drinks.\n\nSo I guess if you are looking to just relax, partake in a few in-house activities, an all-inclusive isn't a bad idea at all. You won't have to worry about where you'll eat and drink, and you can focus on decompressing. However, if you want to be sociable with other solo travelers, there'll be slim pickings at most a-i's, as they appeal more to groups, couples, and families.",

It\u2019s not all inclusive and the food and drinks were expensive, but it was still half the price of staying at an actual all inclusive! I paid $80/night for a private \u201cteepee\u201d (small cabin) with individual AC and breakfast, and about $150 a day on food and drinks; compared to the $500 a night for the nearby all inclusives I counted it as a deal \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f they had all the same tours etc as the resorts were offering, as well as free yoga and little \u201con campus\u201d events.\n\nEdit: just wanted to edit that this particular one in Tulum really felt like a resort! But I also stayed at the one in downtown Cancun and one in Antigua (Guatemala) that felt more like other high-end hostels; nice too but no oceanfront pool or cushy beach loungers etc), of course those ones were also much cheaper, so just wanted to edit that not all Selina\u2019s are like resorts, but some are!",

    "postText": " \n\nHello guys,\n\nSoon I am off to Guilin area for some days and I cannot wait to see it all! Planning is so far very exciting : hikes in Longji, hikes nearby Xingping, bamboo rafting on Yulong. One thing that I still need to plan is renting a scooter and going for a ride in Yulong/Yangshuo area!\n\nI know that doing it spontaneously would be most fun, but I just wish to hear what kind of route would you recommend for a day of riding? I'd love to get some route recommendations. Also, any electric scooter rental places recommendations?\n\nMy only experience with riding such scooters are the city ones in bigger cities of China, so I a bit new to this. Do I need to charge them on the way? Is there such possibility? Would be great to just rent a bicycle but unfortunately my travel partner cannot cycle, so we want to rent one scooter for two.\n\nThank you for bearing with me! I'll grateful for any word of advice :)",

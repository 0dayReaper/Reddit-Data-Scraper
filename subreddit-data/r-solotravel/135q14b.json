    "postText": "I (m21) want to solo travel the Philippines for a month after I go on a family trip to Japan later this year. I went on a month long solo trip around Europe the past  summer and had an amazing time, met so many people and defo caught the travel bug.\n\nLike I said I want to go to the Philippines this year but I don\u2019t know if not having a driving license will majorly limit me as I won\u2019t be able to rent a scooter, I\u2019ve heard people say this is the only way to get around in some places. I might be able to get a licence in time, I\u2019m currently learning but there\u2019s a long waiting list for tests in my country so it\u2019ll be tight. So if I don\u2019t have a license, will it majorly limit me on what I can do, or are there any specific islands I should avoid where I will be limited. The main places I want to go are Palawan, Cebu island, Siquijor and Siargao (maybe Borocay and Bohol depending on time/money).\n\nSo basically how much will not being able to rent scooters limit me, is it worth putting off the trip until I can?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!!",

However, I have left my passport or local drivers license with the shop I\u2019ve rented from. Don\u2019t be alarmed, it\u2019s common.",

You are naming a lot of tourist sites which are more expensive. I personally dont like Boracay but if you want to party I guess it's good. I dont want huge crowds when I hit a beach. I just came back from Palawan and Coron. You need to be very careful where you stay as some locations can be so isolated there isn't cell service.  It can also be a huge hr drive through the jungle and I mean jungle to get to the boats for island hopping. so location is KEY.  Remember if it is raining hard you will not be able to island hop. we had a delay of 2 days to try. thankfully we set aside a week. so plan with extra time. Maybe make a friend online before you go. Filipinos/filipinas are very friendly and great hosts.  I have gone on 15 trips and always had some willing to meet up, offer rides, even take me around.  I have had great luck.",

You could sketch a photo of your face on a notebook and they\u2019d rent you a scooter :p\n\n\nThat said, you don't really NEED to travel with scooter anywhere, trikes are cheap, and it's definitely worth going w/o renting one! And of course it can be very dangerous if you rent one and you don't really know what you're doing. But if you really must give it a try, you'll want a flat, less populated area with not much traffic - somewhere like Siquijor would be best imo.",

It\u2019s all about the boat tours there, so no scooter necessary! I can recommend the night ferry between Coron and Manila btw, which would save you a flight, but be sure to book a ticket with a bed below deck.",

            "comment": "riding scooters here is insanely dangerous, especially if you are new to riding and if you are a foreigner. The lack of rules, the heat, the pollution, the crowds of kamote riders, etc.\n\nMotorcycle checkpoints are very common, if you enjoy being harrassed by local law enforcement, you will love this part of your trip.\n\nmost of the places you listed are pretty touristy so public transpo should be manageable.\n\navoid taxi's at all costs.\n\nregister your SIM. install grab and angkas, use jeepneys/trikes/buses, most of the time the locals will help you get where you need to be.\n\nIf you do decide to ride make sure you let someone know where you are going and when you are expected to be back or arrive at your destination.",

I was just there 2.5 month renting scooters at all the usual tourist beach destinations, got stopped zero times, I never met anyone else that had issues either, and I passed by police many many times.

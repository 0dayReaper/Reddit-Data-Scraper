    "postText": "As I was biking out of Kumamoto my foot slipped and the bike's Pedal slammed into the back of my leg. I wasn't going very fast, but the bike had a lot of weight on the bike. I thought it wasn't much and kept pushing forward. As time went on my leg started to swell and ache.  \nI biked with one leg to a nearby clinic and got there just 15 minutes before they closed. I wasn't able to put too much weight on my foot at this point. I was able to explain what happened to them using Google Translate. They were really kind and they stayed late. The doctor did an exam. He took an X-Ray of my ankle and found out that I have a crack on my Fibula.  The nurse helped wrap my foot to stabilize it and he told me to not put any weight on it for a few days.  They even called a Pharmacy and they were able to deliver the medications to the clinic so I didn't have to walk there.   \nI paid cash and I was very surprised. The bill for everything was only $55, In the US this would have cost $500 even if you had insurance. I was able to slowly bike to a nearby hotel with one leg.  \nI found an umbrella that I have been using as a cane. The swelling has gone down significantly since the accident, but I may have to rework this trip. It gets a bit depressing being alone in a hotel room in a foreign country where you don't speak the language, but hard times give us time to reflect.  \nI will keep you all posted!",

    "postText": " **Hi there!  I am currently looking for a place to live in Europe where I  could manage to cover all my expenses, including rent, bills, food,  wifi, and  emergencies, with a budget of 350 euros per month  . I have come across some rental prices in  Antalya, and while they seem quite affordable ( studio and 1 bed flat for less than 200 euros), I would appreciate any  advice or input you may have regarding the feasibility of living there  on my budget. The reason of this, is that I am considering dedicating myself fully to starting a business from  scratch, and my plan is to live on a budget of 4500 euros for a whole  year while I work on building it up. Unfortunately, I am currently  unable to afford the cost of living where I am, so I'm exploring my  options.** \n\n**As a solo female, I would like to know how  safe it is to live in Antalya, and if there are any areas I should  avoid. Also considering that I do not drive and will rely on public  transport.**\n\n **If you have any other suggestions for safe places to live within a 350 euros budget per month in Europe or nearby, I would love to hear them.** \n\n**Thank you very  much for your help! :)**",

But leaving yourself 150 \u20ac a month for food, utilities, health insurance doesn't seem  reasonable to me.\n\nFinding someone to split a flat seems your only options.  There are a ton of foreigners in Antalya, I went before Russia invaded Ukraine, so unsure how that has changed the demographics there.",

You may think it as a mix of Bologna, Pisa, and Venice from Italy. it is one of the top 10 safest, and most beautiful cities in the world. im not saying that, researches say. for 350\u20ac i belive you can afford there. it is not an metropol, but definitely not an village too there is numerous cultural activities, such as theaters and museums; also a lot of. pub and cafee for entertainment too. it is famous as a student city, therefore, it is cheap and very, very modern. look for it, and dont hesitate to contact me if you need.",

Iceland just announced that its borders will be open to vaccinated visitors starting March 18th, 2021. \n\nI\u2019m a teacher and recently got vaccinated. I found a good deal yesterday, and I\u2019ll be going from June 23rd until July 14th. I\u2019m open to tips, advice, suggestions, etc. Thanks in advance!",

Make sure to go to community pools. Get a city pass and go to all the museums in Reykjavik.\n\nI can also give some book recommendations if you're into that",

Food is really expensive and simple, so it\u2019s a viable option, especially considering most people don\u2019t stay for over a week. That said, Icelandic food is IMO quite hearty, wholesome, and good, and definitely worth trying everything.",

Going to a kebab shop for two curries and two bottled waters, $60. The Bon\u00fas markets are fabulous though, and groceries are very similar in cost to those in the U.S., especially things like lamb. We had our one year old with us, and organic baby food and diapers were identical in price to the U.S. We snapped a photo of a sign at the market for $20 avocados - a very pricey Cinco de Mayo, but understandable since everything needs to be flown in. And yes, get your booze at the duty-free at Keflavik airport - even the boxed wine at the V\u00ednb\u00fa\u00f0in was eyewateringly expensive. But overall we had a tremendous time in our little apartment in Reykjavik, lots of home cooked dinners, walking downtown, and the museums were fantastic. Will definitely be back!",

Grocery store sells only 2.5% or less alcohol beer and they taste like piss.\n\n* If you plan to rent a car/camper , be advise than gas cost around 2$ / liter . My tip is don't rent while solo travelling . I think this option is best for 2+ppl .\n\n* Tourist-trap things to do are actually good . Whale Sightseeing , Museums , Golden Triangle. \n\n* If you plan on going to the Blue Lagoon , book NOW because the place is usually fully-booked 3 months in advance without a pandemic.\n\nEdit for more $$ tips : bring your cigarettes if you smoke because they sell for like 20$CAN a pack and don't order whale dish in a restaurant ( not just because , it's whale and we love them but because at 60-75$ a plate , it's the most tourist-trap thing ever . Eating whale is not a thing in Iceland , only like 3% of population in the most remote area do this ). The only \"different\" meat i refuse to eat.",

                    "comment": "\"Officially confirmed\" is not really a standard used in science. But the data supports a steep reduction in transmission after vaccination. Pfizer made a deal with Israel to provide vaccinations in return for extensive data, and now that Israel is more than half vaccinated we're starting to get back real-world population data.\n\nHere is a journal article from last month [(BMJ)](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n567):\n\n&gt;  A case control study, which has been peer reviewed and published in the *New England Journal of Medicine*, compared 596\u2009618 people who were newly vaccinated in Israel and matched them to unvaccinated controls.[1](https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n567#ref-1)  Two doses of the mRNA vaccine reduced symptomatic cases by 94%,  hospitalisation by 87%, and severe covid-19 by 92%, according to the  data from the Clalit Institute for Research which is Israel\u2019s biggest  healthcare provider. . . .  The study also suggests the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine is effective against  the B.1.1.7 variant which was first identified in the UK. During the  study period, an increasing share of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Israel\u2014up to  80%\u2014were of this variant. The data, however, provide no information  about the effectiveness of the vaccine against the South African  variant, B.1.351, as this was estimated to be rare in Israel at the time  of the study.",

So basically we could just have far more people walking around with Covid that don't have symptoms. \nThe second is due to how unfair it is to only allow people to travel who 'qualify' for a vaccine. Personally as someone who is a frontline emergency worker who has had to be constantly going in and out of houses and having close contact with people throughout this why should I then watch as people who've had the luxury of working from home get to go on holiday because they are older than me. I guess maybe it's selfish but until everyone is offered a vaccine I don't think it's right for some people to have a luxury that others quite simply can't because of age.",

From what I've read, there's no waiting period after you've been \"completely\" vaccinated. So you could theoretically enter Iceland the day after your J&amp;J shot, or after your second Pfizer or Moderna shot.",

    "postText": "Hey all, I\u2019m visiting LA  at the end of September. I\u2019m coming from POS, connecting through IAH and then on to LAX. This is also my first solo trip.  27, brown male, south asian descent if that matters to anything below. \n\nIn terms of the flights, I land at Houston at around 5am if everything goes according to plan. I\u2019d have 2 hours to get through immigration and then connect to my flight at 730am. Does anyone have any tips / insights for making Houston immigration as painless as possible? I\u2019m not checking any bags; simply flying with a backpack. Also is Houston immigration usually quick at that hour? Can I expect a huge line or am I making my connection without competitively sprinting through the airport?\n\nWhen I get to LAX, I\u2019m gonna have to get to Pasadena. I\u2019d rather not rent a car or drive through the famous LA traffic. Is the public transit system relatively safe? Ive read a couple of stories about incidents on the \u201cred line\u201d. I\u2019ve got no problem getting off a bus / subway and doing a couple minutes walking if it\u2019s faster and cheaper than a private taxi / rental providing it\u2019s safe enough. \n\nAlso for LA, what hours are usually peak traffic times? My flight back home leaves LAX at 7am so I\u2019ve gotta be at the airport for 4am. Would there be a lot of traffic getting from Pasadena to LAX at that hour? That\u2019s the only time I plan to take an Uber or Lyft since it\u2019ll be dark out. \n\nThanks I\u2019m advance!",

[https://www.flylax.com/flyaway-bus/union-station](https://www.flylax.com/flyaway-bus/union-station)\n\nFrom Union station you catch the Metro L Line (Gold line) and goes thru Pasadena.

Keep in mind if you're planning on traveling outside of Pasadena for the rest of your trip, you'll be commuting on the metro back into downtown, uber, etc. Map out your intentions while staying, and you may get some better advice from everyone. Also, the LA subs r/losangeles can likely help for more specifics while you're here. Have a fun time!",

LA is VERY car dependent and public transport isn\u2019t great, but also not terrible depending on where you\u2019re going. You\u2019re much better off doing Uber\u2019s when you\u2019re here unless you\u2019re close to a metro stop that\u2019s also close to your destination. Honestly I\u2019d avoid it all together thought - a ton a crazies out and about and as a local I rarely take them, same for a specific place going to (not from).\n\nGetting to LAX at 4am will have zero traffic. Otherwise traffic\u2019s pretty consistent throughout the day, but especially bad during the morning commute and around midday-730p ish.",

            "comment": "&gt;Is the public transit system relatively safe?\n\nGetting attacked is very rare but the chance is not 0 unfortunately. Haven't read the other comments but you can take the LAX Flyway to Union Station, then take the Metro L (Gold Line) to Pasadena. This is likely the fastest way to get there without a car. You should be fine if you keep to yourself on the Metro line; Flyaway is a coach bus that costs $10 for each ride.\n\n&gt;what hours are usually peak traffic times?\n\nIf it's a weekday, there's terrible traffic from like 5 AM to 9 AM heading into LA proper. If you're leaving Pasadena at 3 AM, you won't have an issue at all.\n\nYou didn't mention where you're going in LA, but there are only 2 subways in LA: the red and purple. Neither are around Pasadena but from what I've read on /r/LosAngeles in the past 2 weeks, the police and cleanliness have been increased recently. You most likely won't experience anything too crazy as long as you're not on early morning or late at night. Depending on location, you can take LADOT's DASH buses for free and also Metrolink (not the same as Metro) to go long distances, like to Disneyland.",

            "comment": "Pasadena is pretty far away from LAX and you'll be doing a number of transfers between different systems in LA to get to your final destination. It could easily take you 2-3x as long vs driving. You don't have to drive yourself, its easy enough to get a taxi or rideshare. \n\nThe key to LA is to stay near the things you want to do. So if the things you want to do are in or near Pasadena, you're pretty much set. But if things like the beaches of Santa Monica or Venice are in your plans, you're going to be stuck in traffic or on a bus for a long time to make it work.\n\nIn terms of safety on public transit, I personally found the bus operators in LA to be very much of the \"take no shit\" attitude and because everyone has to mostly board up front, the troublemakers are less likely to get on. The underground metro and, to a lesser extent, light rail lines are basically unmanned and can be sketch depending on the time of day, and it can change pretty quickly. \n\nI had like one mentally unstable person get in my face and start yelling at me while I was at the 7th/EXpo line which is near some kinda sketch areas.  I did my best to ignore him and yeah 95% of my public transit trips in LA were uneventful, but that one time is what stuck out in my mind.\n\nIt should go without saying but LA isn't like Chicago or NYC where there is safety in numbers. During peak commute times you'll probably be fine but sometimes you'll be in a train car or bus at 2pm during the week or randomly on a weekend and it'll be empty. Its kinda like the opposite of driving in LA. In LA you want to avoid driving at peak commute times but if you're going to be using public transit, you might as well get on when the locals and commuters are using it too.",

If you use a major company, you can get a car for as low as ~$30 USD/day after taxes and fees, and in my most recent visit there, I got one from Midway (a local discount renter) for only $15 USD/day.\n\nThe only heads up with rentals is that the check-in lines at the airport rental car stations can get very long, so you should pre-book directly with them and sign up for whatever membership program they have so you can sort out all the documents ahead of time online and get to skip the line when you get there.\n\nIf driving is an option for you, car rental is a no brainer: you'd be wasting way more money on Ubers or way more time chasing down public transportation in L.A.",

    "postText": "male 24, solo. September 15 - 22, 2023 . I\u2019ll be flying into Calgary and renting a car to go backpacking in the Canadian Rockies. I\u2019m looking for advice on connecting with other backpackers to hike with. \n\nI\u2019m also looking for information regarding hiking Maligne Pass and Replica Peak Trailhead. Looking at this site, it says that the trail is no longer maintained. Does anyone know if this is still feasible and worth doing? Or if it is overgrown? \nhttps://www.10adventures.com/backpacking/jasper/maligne-pass-and-replica-peak-backpack/",

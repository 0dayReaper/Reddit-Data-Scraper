    "postText": "Hi everyone, I could use some assistance for finishing up my 2.5 week Balkan trip itinerary. I'm just looking for general advice on other places to go that I may be missing/overall structure of the trip. My main priorities are to see off-the-beaten path cities, spend time on the beach, and get some good parties in.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**EDIT: UPDATED ITINERARY**\n\n3 Nights in Belgrade\n\n\\-Train from Belgrade to Bar-\n\n1 night in Bar\n\n5 nights in Kotor\n\n3 nights in Mostar\n\n4 nights in Sarajevo\n\n1 night in Belgrade\n\nThanks all for the suggestions! I ended up scrapping Budva, and will spend 5 nights in Kotor and will spend 4 nights in Sarajevo. I can take a day trip to Budva and many other spots in Montenegro. I will take the train from Belgrade to Bar during the daytime because it looks gorgeous. \n\nThanks again everyone. Feel free to keep suggesting any changes for me to make. I'm glad I added a little more time to Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as making my schedule more open by leaving my time in Budva flexible for other stuff.\n\nCheers all!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n~~3 Nights in Belgrade, Serbia~~\n\n~~-Overnight Bus to Kotor-~~\n\n~~4 nights in Kotor, Montenegro~~\n\n~~3 nights in Budva, Montenegro~~\n\n~~2 nights in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina~~\n\n~~3 nights in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina~~\n\n~~1 night in Belgrade, Serbia~~\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNotes for itinerary:\n\n**Serbia:** I plan to stay in Belgrade for 4 nights (5 if you include the overnight bus trip to Kotor) because the nightlife looks amazing there, plus I plan to take a couple day trips to nearby cities and tourist sites like Novi Sad, Subotica, and \u0420\u0430\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0432\u0440\u0452\u0430\u0432\u0430. I would love to see Tara National Park, but after researching it seems like it is very difficult to access without a car, which limits me. I also am spending one more night in Belgrade at the end of the trip because that is where I fly out of to get to Munich.\n\n**Montenegro:** I would like to see Durmitor national Park, but it just seems really difficult to do anything there without a car either. It would be cool to spend a night in Zabljak, but it would just be for the purpose of staying in a cool mountainous region, and not being able to do much there. Seems like too big of a hassle considering how difficult it is to get there without a car. I plan to spend a lot of time in Kotor in Budva because I would love to do some beach stuff, and I could easily take day trips to other nearby areas if need be. I know I am spending a lot of time in Kotor and Budva, but I plan to take a couple day trips to other parts of the country from there since the cities are quite small and there isn't much to do there.\n\n**Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina:** Again, I would like to do nature but I am limited by not having a car, so splitting time between Sarajevo and Mostar seems best. If there are any other cities you recommend for visiting in Bosnia feel free to comment down below.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n~~Overall, what recommendations do you all have? If any? I am thinking about going to Bosnia first after Montenegro so then the water might be a little warmer in Montenegro (I would be there in Early June as opposed to Late May).~~\n\n~~My main questions are as follows:~~\n\n1. ~~Is 7 days too long for Kotor/Budva? Should I cut off a night or two and spend more time in Bosnia and Herzegovina? Or is there a different (and accessible by public transport) part of Montenegro I'm missing?~~\n2. ~~Is it worth spending a few nights in other cities in Serbia? I feel like Novi Sad and Subotica could be pretty reasonable day trips so then I can spend the night in Belgrade for a bit of partying.~~\n\nThanks everyone, I greatly appreciate all the help in advance. Cheers!",

            "comment": "Zabljak/Durmitor is absolutely doable without a car. I was there in October.\n\nYou can take a taxi from the city centre for \u20ac20 to Sedlo Pass. From there you can hike up to the highest mountain in the area, Bobotov Kuk. Views are amazing and the trail is pretty easy to follow. You can then walk all the way back to Zabljak, if you\u2019re up for it. If you\u2019re fit and have hiked before it\u2019s not that hard. The hike is a bit technical at some parts but nothing too bad. \n\nFrom Bobotov, you can hike back to Zabljak. On the way you will pass an ice cave as well as Crno lake (the most visited lake in the area).\n\nIt\u2019s one of my favorite hikes I\u2019ve done, since you\u2019re pretty much all alone on the mountain. I met 4 people I think. DON\u2019T GO HIKING ALONE though unless you\u2019re very experienced, and even then it\u2019s a bad idea. You\u2019ll be able to find someone who\u2019ll want to tag along at your accommodation. \n\nSo yeah it\u2019s 100% doable without a car, and 2 nights is enough if you do the long hike I mentioned.",

I grew up in Oregon and have a lot of experience with hiking, but I don't have any experience solo-hiking so I feel like this would not be the best time to do it, especially in a much more remote area. I wouldn't want to try and bank on me meeting someone in my hostel who would want to do the same exact hike as me. But, I will definitely keep this in consideration for future times. Thank you so much for sharing!",

            "comment": "When your in Mostar make sure you do a tour of the Herzegovina region- think quite a few tours similar. Kravica waterfalls are wonderful and get to see some other cool sights. Takes under the day and is well worth the trip. \n\nOutside the two cities Jajce is really pretty and nice for a day trip, but is a bit of a trip out of Sarajevo. Great waterfall and feels Bosnian. Went there as was in Banja for a few days (in the north)\n\nI adore Sarajevo- make sure you do the bobsleigh track. Cable car up is pricy but nice view, can also walk up in a hour or so. Drenched in history and culture, def one of my fav European cities. Know a great Hostel and a few bars if you need! \n\nYour right on Kotor- can do the city area in a day but other trips you can do. Weather was awful when I was there which cut a lot of activities out.\nEnjoy, been and still jealous!",

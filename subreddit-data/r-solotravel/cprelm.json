Hiked up most of the way to Pilatus which was hard but worth it! Never had the chance to go to Geneva although that was the plan, will definitely be visiting at some point though! Naturally Beautiful, clean and traditional country is Switzerland. Pricey but worth it!",

We camped in Lauterbrunnen, took the train to Junfrau (train ride alone is worth it, plus if you go in summer there is still snow up there). We went paragliding in Interlaken and did the high ropes adventure park. Took the gondola up to mount Pilatus, it\u2019s beautiful!Plus they have a pretty fun alpine slide up there. Depending where you stay, the main city\u2019s aren\u2019t too far away by train. We were able to go to Bern and Zurich (bear in mind everything is closed on a Sunday, we made that mistake once!). We booked accommodation near lucerne and interlaken, so spent most of our afternoons were spent by the lakes with some wine and cheese. \nSwitzerland was by far my favourite place, I hope you enjoy it too \u263a\ufe0f",

Generally, going to Grisons, to Lucern/central Switzerland, to the Bernese alps and Valais will give you plenty of hiking options with stunning views too. www.wandern.ch has like, all the information, just not in English unfortunately. www.schweizmobil.ch however does have an English page, as does myswitzerland.com - for the easy inspiration. (I'm not much of a hiker, but I live in Switzerland. Feel free to shoot me a DM if you want some non-hiking specific tips/recommendations!)",

Personally, I am in love with eastern Switzerland as it's more old style Switzerland with small towns and homie vibe. There's an amazing place to hike up to from a small town (you can even drive part of the way if you don't want to do the full hike) called Ebenalp, in the region of Appenzell (where the cheese originally came from - Appenzeller). Theres a small hostel/restaurant you can eat at or even stay. I love that place very much in the summer/fall. \n\nAnother one of my favorites is the S\u00e4ntis. You take a cable car up to the top or hike and the view is breathtaking. Plus at the base there's an old school cheese making store/factory (really small....not really factory) that is amazing. The delicious ripe cheese scent smacks you like a brick wall when you enter....glorious cheese.",

I realized that the path to true freedom is not outside in the world but within. So began my journey into myself. I am more free now working a 9-5 job than I ever was travelling the world. No longer a slave to my mind, I am (In Yoda's voice) :p\n\nHaving said that...nothing like the feeling of starting an amazing adventure! Good luck amigo!",

Starts making his way back up and by now the after work crowd is starting to make its way down the stairs. He tries to tell them that they are going the wrong way but to no avail. His progress is slow going against the sea of people rushing down the stairs. But once in a while, someone makes eye contact with him. Understands him. So much said while saying so little. Happy trails bud and thanks for your reply.",

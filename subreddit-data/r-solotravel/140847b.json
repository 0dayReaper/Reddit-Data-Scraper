    "postText": "24M - Was getting bored of the day to day and the heat back home in dubai is just too much. So decided it was time for a mix up. So decided on going to start my travels for 1-3 months and just taking it day by day. First destination on the list\u2026 THAILAND. \n\nNote: I will be super blunt and sometimes explicit, outlining each individual day to give you a strong feel of what this trip was truly like.\n\nSaturday - June 4th\n\nFlew in on a red eye, and checked into my hotel, \u201cThe one patio hotel\u201d. Nice hotel, great AC and awesome location. Spent the first few hours just trying to get my bearing. Dubai and thailand are very different. \n\nAlthough it almost seems like thai people fear westerners. Anyways, decided to pickup some weed for later. Went to some dispensary down the street. Was then recommended to get BOLT, made getting around much cheaper then apps like grab. \n\nThen decided it was way too hot and I\u2019m gonna need to get a bike, got a basic bike for 500baht  (per day) after checking several places and them all being out of stock, I just settled on overpaying. Knew I was getting way ripped off.\n\nAfter then realizing how bad the traffic on pattaya beach decided to go to the mall (attached to Hilton hotel) and park up and grab food.\n\n*I was starving, didn\u2019t eat for like 8 hours since before my flight.*\n\nWent to the food court, got one of those cards where you load a balance. Ps. The food sucked. Got like a wonton soup and it tasted like water.\n\nThen went on to shop and pickup some socks and a pair of shorts because my idea was to pack 4 day worth of clothing and figure it out as I go. (This mall looked like something straight out of North America)\n\nAfter decided to go get a massage next door, which was only alright. Definitely had better.\n\nWent back to the hotel to change, was too hot and then thought lets go do some touristy stuff - so the sanctuary of truth sounds interesting lets go.\n\nArrived at 5:30 via BOLT and found out I missed the last tour, so paid 50 baht to just see it from a distance and wow was it gorgeous. Definitely a place worth checking out.\n\nNow realizing it was starting to get dark I headed back to the hotel grabbed my bike to head back to pattaya beach to chill with a beer and watch the sunset.\n\nTo be real the beach was only alright. Kinda subpar, and dirty. But still a great sunset the sky turned like a solid purple after for like an hour. Very cool, never seen that before.\n\nNow time to eat again got some amazing fried chicken in front of the same mall as before at this place called yummy fried chicken. This is probably one of the highlights of my day. Then went on to the terminal 1 market (don\u2019t recommend) and had some shitty noddle dish. Very unmemorable and thats saying much being I decided to smoke my joint from earlier and it was still bad \ud83d\ude02.\n\nOn the list next, walking street. Apparently what pattaya is famous for and guess what it was closed due to Buddha day according to locals.\n\nSo read on reddit I have to try something called a \u201csoppey\u201d. This was subpar, maybe the girl I chose but Saigon does it better \ud83d\ude05.\n\nThen decided i was hungry got some street food across from my hotel - kababs, was awesome. Spicy as all hell though. Grabbed some mango sticky rice. My favourite!!!! \n\nThen went for a foot massage and headed home and watched Netflix and ate the sticky rice.\n\n-\n\nOverview: Crazy busy day as a solo. Sucks it was buddha day but made the best of it and had a blast. Although Pattaya is not for me, too wild west for my taste and not much thai local food and way touristy.\n\n-\n\nTomorrow: Off to Bangkok! \ud83d\ude43\n\n\nP.s. would love feedback, new to this so the style may be way out of wack!!!",

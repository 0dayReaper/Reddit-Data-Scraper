    "postText": "I haven't seen any other posts about specifically before trip ending anxiety. I have 5 days left of a 4.5 month long solo trip and man, I'm anxious to go home. \n\nI think its because of a mix of factors. Before I left, I was in a relationship, which is over now. In fact, this will be the first time I'm single and home in over 5 yrs(jumped from relationship to relationship in my teens). I don't have a huge support system apart from my parents and don't have a lot of friends either. I think it's hard to go home to that. I don't have many plans set up for when I'm back except a wedding out of state. And a few like \"buy this,\" \"clean this,\" \"go eat that.\" \n\nMy solo travel expirence has been incredible and freeing and I've learned a lot about myself. Part of me wants to go back to the stability of home, but part of me never wants to have to drop traveling except to see family. I'm worried I'll become depressed when I'm back. And I guess I'll finally have to face the real world again. The US makes me so anxious. I can barely remember what my room looks like. I'm planning on applying to universities in Europe(I'm from the usa).\n\n I just can't seem to feel calm. I'm taking walks/bikes in nature to try and relax. &amp; meditate. But nothing seems to help. \n\nAnyways this is kinda a random jumble of thoughts but yeah. I'm not really looking forward to going home. There's not much there for me.",

            "comment": "I always find it hard to go home to my \"life\" after a big trip.  I try to ask myself, \"why is that?\"  Like, what about travel is so much better and how can I weave that into my everyday life?  \n\nLike most people, my everyday life includes a job I need to survive.  I also live in an area I like and don't want to really relocate because of my job--so there are limitations of course.  What I did try to encourage myself to do though is do local events and trips often.  There's so much locally we often take for granted.  I also read a few books on my solo trips and enjoyed it so much--so I promised myself I'd continue that (a hard one to keep up honestly!).  I met new people on group tours, took some adventure type trips too, which are things I can do locally and did.  Near home I signed up for a kayaking course that met twice and then the third class we did a sea trip together.\n\nIt's all easier said (or thought) than done.  Write it down.  Make plans now while you have momentum.  I always find myself waking up the day of an event I registered (and paid for!)  dreading to attend what I signed myself up for--but never once have I actually regretted going off to some class or little trip locally after the event.  Push yourself.",

Also a good idea to plan a future trip, even if small, to have something to look forward to. You\u2019ve had a new destination in front of you for months now, your brain kind of needs this stimulation. Also if possible, try to live in a part of your town/city that\u2019s you\u2019ve never lived in before. After my first huge trip of a year I tried to go back to my exact same old life and I had grown/changed to much and it felt like I\u2019d gone backwards almost. A year later, after a two month trip, I moved to a whole new hood and it was exciting again! Helped a lot. Made new friends etc. you\u2019re a traveler now, even at home. Nice to maintain this outlook on life.",

Maybe you're just in a big growth stage and the people at home don't necessarily reflect that for you at the moment.\nIt's all good.

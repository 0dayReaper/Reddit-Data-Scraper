    "postText": "I promise this isn\u2019t a direct response to the weird \u201cbada** solo travelin ladies\u201d post from a few days ago, but it has been on my mind and then some stuff happened today that made me re-annoyed by the concept of women being \u201cdamsels in distress\u201d when we travel, so here I am.\n\nI\u2019m headed to Amsterdam tonight and the ONLY responses I\u2019ve gotten from family and friends are along the lines of, \u201cBe careful. Someone was raped there a few months ago\u201d or \u201cAre you traveling alone? I feel like that could be asking for trouble\u201d. Those are two REAL LIFE responses I\u2019ve received to my Amsterdam trip.  Not a single person has said \u201cOmg have so much fun!\u201d or anything along those lines.\n\nOn the contrary, my cousin (a 6\u20194 250 pound dude) headed to Germany last night and posted about it on social media. He is also going solo.  Responses to his travels? \u201cJealous! Have so much fun!\u201d, \u201cOmg you\u2019re gonna have a BLAST, can\u2019t wait to hear about it\u201d, and my personal favorite, \u201cYES BROTHER, GET DRUNK AF\u201d\n\nWHY? Like why are people not excited when a female decides to take charge and do her own thing? I\u2019m SO excited for my Amsterdam trip, and I feel like my friends and family\u2019s responses, while well-intentioned, put a bit of a damper on it. \n\nAs much as I love my solo adventures and certainly don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s approval for them, it\u2019s also nice to know that friends and family are excited for me too. But I honestly sometimes feel like they\u2019re just waiting for something bad to happen. Like that just HAS to be the end result for a solo female traveler.\n\nAnyways, I\u2019ll enjoy this trip no matter what. Just needed to get that off my chest. \n\nThank you for listening to my Ted Talk.\n\nEdit: Just want to say thank you SO much for the thoughtful replies, I love this community so much.\n\nAlso wanted to clarify something. \n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of people comment that my family and friends love me and just want the best for me (of course they do). However, there is a clear distinction between saying \u201cSafe travels\u201d and saying \u201cWow, you\u2019re going alone? That\u2019s so scary\u201d.\n\nOne of those encourages safe travel, and shows that the person loves and cares about you. Of course, this is normal.\n\nThe other discourages travel and makes you feel like you\u2019re putting yourself in danger when in fact, you\u2019re not.\n\nI just wanted to clarify the difference. You can wish someone well without making them feel like they\u2019re making a bad decision (because solo traveling as a woman is NOT a bad decision)",

It's a blip on the radar.  \n\nDon't do stupid shit and learn the local culture before putting yourself at risk.  A solo single lady going to a bar in a South African township where no local women go is dumb. Making derogatory comments and being a jackass to lady boys will get you in trouble.  Use Uber instead of a taxi or better yet arrange for a pickup and drop off.  Even hostels do that.  Don't get drunk with strangers in strange places unless you're prepared to accept horrible consequences.\n\nOh and countries with a terrible reputation for problems?  First of all double check if any of it is even true.  Egypt for example is friggin fantastic and the stereotypes are a bunch of bullshit.  Spent a month there and there were solo men and women and everyone had a great time.  Don't be a prick and learn how to politely say la shukran.\n\nLastly grow some thicker skin.

I know it's a little different from discouraging comments like 'you shouldn't go there because x', but they give me the same feeling. \n\nThey annoy the fuck out of me. Most of them come from my mom, or other family members. When I think of the why (why mention this instead of saying positive things), the only thing I can think of, is fear for the unknown. These people making these comments usually are not travelers themselves. They go on a 2 week beach vacation once or twice a year and that's that. They heard once or twice about these things happening to young, pretty women on the news, because that's sensational and news stopped being solely about important things a long time ago. So when I tell my mom I'm going to Panama, she's not thinking 'oooh, pretty islands, monkeys, cool!!!'. Nope, because she doesn't know anything about Panama. Except that 2 Dutch girls of my age disappeared there, and that she doesn't want that happening to me.\n\n\nI stopped trying to change their views a long time ago. \"Don't worry, it's safe, look at these pictures\". Doesn't work. It's a psychological thing: negative things have like 10x more impact than positive things. So now when someone tells me one of those fearoftheunknownworldbingo's, I say thanks I will, and I'm going to have lots of fun and it's going to be amazing and beautiful. ",

Years ago, when I made plans to backpack Southeast Asia alone, the response was overwhelming concern for my safety.  It's frustrating but at least you should recognize that it's a sign of care.\n\nLeaving the house for any reason is dangerous... but proper risk management recognizes that some things are safer than others, and some things have risk at an acceptable level.  Other things seem like an unreasonable risk to those who succumb to media-driven fearmongering.\n\nFurthermore, there are legitimately places that solo women would be less safe than a solo man.  Typically the sorts of places where women aren't treated well to begin with.  I wouldn't include anywhere in Europe on that list... but that's just part of being wise about personal safety.\n\nAll that said, have fun on your trip, and as my mother says every time I leave the house (even now in my thirties): be careful.",

I understand where OP is coming from: that thread she is referring to made me absolutely cringe while reading it. Women are \u201cbad asses\u201d if they solo travel...I never thought of it it that way. I just look at them as people trying to maximize the experience. Solo travel is something I\u2019m very passionate about and feel all types of people should at least try it out. \n\nBut at the same time I get it where others are coming from. Just a few weeks ago a girl from my community in Miami was visiting Costa Rica and decided to stay for an extra day solo and was murdered by the security at her BnB. Costa Rica is one of the safest places a person can stick themselves for a solo experience. And look what happened...\n\nShould women live in total fear and never experience solo travel? no. Should women be cognizant that unfortunately the scale of safety may not be tipped in your favor? Yes. \n\nMy sister (26) as we speak is prepping for her first solo travel to Japan. I\u2019ve been there tons and can safely say it\u2019s safer than a lot of the US. And I\u2019m proud of her for doing her own thing.. But would I feel the same if she were going to central or South America solo after what happened? No not really to be honest. \n\nI think family\u2019s and friends that get concerned, their heart is in the right place. It\u2019s really unfortunate the world is the way it is, but you don\u2019t owe it to anyone to cave to their fears. \n\nBut please don\u2019t discount the ones that fear for you, because they love you.

The other is to know where you're going, ie make sure you find out where the bad areas in town are. This is especially true in larger cities like Buenos Aires. These were tips given by multiple Argentinians, for both men and women to follow. \n\nThat said, it'll be a fun time!

    "postText": "I'm a 26yr old Honduran who's gotten tired of my 8-6pm job as an engineer, so I decided to quit my job, sell my unnecessary belongings and heading for a 6 months solo trip (may extend to a year or two depending on my experience) wherever the world takes me. I'm planning on a couple of months in Thailand as my first stop but am also eager to visit Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and some parts in Europe such as Scotland, Ireland and Romania. (Idk, countries might come and go along the way, I don't want to have a strict schedule). I am really anxious so I have a couple of questions maybe some of you can answer.\n\nIs there a way to make money along the way? I would say I'm not going on a hyper tight budget but I would prefer if there are any suitable options not to drain my entire funds. I don't have a remote job and have considered it but do you guys think it ruins the experience? I want to meet new people, head on adventures and feel that a remote job would anchor me to a place that has Wi-Fi access.",

The legality of these exchanges can often fall into more of a grey area, so you definitely want to do your research for whatever country you're trying to visit and be careful with it.",

The classic route for Canadians is: travel south east asia until you run out of money, go do a working holiday visa in australia and get $$ working on farms, then go back to Asia/India/Wherever with your fat stacks and when you run out, repeat the process in NZ.\n\nThen the new one is to do the digital nomad thing, but you generally need to be established already in an industry where that is common.",

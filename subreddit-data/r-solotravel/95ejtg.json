    "postText": "Alright, I\u2019ve been around a while now and I've noticed that the overarching advice doled out on this sub when it comes to solo travel seems to be biased towards staying in hostels and meeting up with other travelers. Most threads I come across, there\u2019s people swearing by the fact that it won\u2019t be a \u201cfun\u201d trip if you don\u2019t stay in a hostel for the social aspect and meet up with others while you\u2019re there. \n\nWell, not all of us are social butterflies. Not all of us are looking for a necessarily social experience while traveling. We just want to travel to experience the place by ourselves. Many of us are comfortable with our own company for very long periods of time without getting bored or lonely. It\u2019s not antisocial, it\u2019s introversion. We tend to be hypersensitive to everything around us and being alone is how we recharge ourselves in an increasingly overwhelming and chaotic world (plugging /r/introvert here). \n\nI\u2019ve done many international trips solo now and they were all excellent despite me not having met up with anyone in a majority of them. I was by myself the entire time. I\u2019m not traveling to meet up with anyone, I\u2019m traveling to just experience a new lifestyle and immerse myself in a different culture where no-one knows who I am. This is a blissful scenario for an introvert. So to make up for all the lack of introvert travel advice around here, here is a list of tips and tricks I\u2019ve learned while solo traveling the past six years:\n\n* **Schedule recharge time:** If you\u2019re an introvert, you already know the importance of this. For me, this is every night between 10PM to midnight. I get back and just lay in bed listening to music, going through the pictures I took that day, and planning my activities for the next day. If I don\u2019t have this time to relax and recover, I wake up extremely cranky and unenthusiastic the following morning. I need this time to process everything that happened during the day and mentally prepare myself for the next day. I tend to feel a little disillusioned and scatterbrained whenever I don\u2019t spend time recharging my brain the night before, so I\u2019ve made sure to do it all the time now and it has improved my mood the next day tenfold. \n\n* **Stay in Airbnbs (private rooms):** I\u2019m going to advise you to not stay in hostels and instead opt for an Airbnb where you have your own room. If you\u2019re going for the recharge time, you need the privacy. The last thing you want while trying to relax is a bunch of loud people hooting and hollering around you. This is especially exaggerated in the European cities, as they tend to be filled with loud obnoxious teenagers (in my experience) and is far less common in Japanese hostels, where quietness and solitude are easy to find anywhere you stay (even the capsule hotels). Yes, private Airbnb rooms tend to be reasonably more expensive than hostels, but I\u2019m personally okay with spending a little extra to preserve my own mental wellbeing and sanity. You don\u2019t have to do this and you can obviously just go for the hostel and roll with it by putting on earbuds through the night, but I have trouble falling asleep when I know there\u2019s other strangers in the room with me. Introverts have varying levels of tolerance for what they can put up with, so do whatever works best for you. You might even get lucky if you\u2019re traveling in the off-season and the hostel has tons of empty beds.  \n\n* **Start off cheap:** So Airbnbs can indeed get expensive, but a good trick I\u2019ve found to offset the cost is to start my trip with really cheap Airbnbs and gradually book slightly nicer and nicer ones in the different cities as the trip goes on. I start off in some low-end hole in the wall type place (yeah, these exist on Airbnb if you look hard enough and use the right filters) but by the end of the trip, I\u2019m usually staying in a pretty nice modern place. This helps because as the trip goes on, you tend to get more tired and exhausted and want a nicer place to relax in after every day, but when the trip is just beginning, you\u2019re willing to put up with a lot more inconveniences. This advice isn\u2019t specifically geared towards introverts and applies to all travelers. \n\n* **Do extended stays:** It\u2019s easy to plan a two-week trip across Europe where you\u2019re staying in one city for 2-3 days and moving on to the next one after having checked off all the touristy sightseeing spots. It\u2019s fine to do this, but just know that you won\u2019t get any sense of what it\u2019s actually like to live in the city as a local with this type of itinerary. If possible, try to stay in a city for 5-6 days. You can spread out our itinerary quite a bit and won\u2019t be in a mad rush to see everything before moving on. This also allows you to linger around in places for longer (I love doing this in caf\u00e9s), stroll through lesser-known neighborhoods, and explore parts of the city that tourists don\u2019t normally go in to. This is a lot of fun to do in European cities, because there\u2019s so much history and they\u2019ve got so much going on that you can just walk around or take the subways everywhere. This helps alleviate museum fatigue and cathedral fatigue in those European cities too. Rick Steves has a bunch of fantastic and [free audio tours for most of Europe](https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/audio/audio-tours), which I download and put on my phone before getting there. Then I just walk around in the city following his instructions as he points out interesting buildings and talks about the history of the place. It's wonderful, check it out if you haven't done it before. \n\n* **Don't overplan it:** I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen travel itineraries or posts from other folks on this sub where they list out what to do and where to go during the trip. I look at these to get a general sense of where all the sightseeing spots are, but I never actually follow an itinerary. I always just start the day by wandering off towards a certain direction, get some brunch at a caf\u00e9, and continue to explore the area until something interesting catches my eye. Of course, I eventually hit up the sightseeing spots and take a couple of selfies at them, but it tends to be very organic and unplanned. Take note that there are places where you can\u2019t just wing it and do need to plan ahead and book tickets to save yourself a lot of time (the Colosseum and Vatican Museums in Rome come to mind), but for the most part, you should be able to make up the itinerary as you go. \n\n* **Live like a local:** This is going to sound like cheesy travel advice, but these things are honestly my favorite parts of solo travel. I shop at the local supermarkets and buy strange ingredients to make meals with, I like to sit at caf\u00e9s for hours just peoplewatching, and I love to stroll into random bookstores and skim through all the local magazines. All these are solo activities and these will all seem silly to non-introverts, but if you\u2019re the type of person who gets a lot of enjoyment out of this, you know exactly what I mean. I\u2019ve had people tell me that I \u201cwasted\u201d an entire day in London at one point because I spent the whole day at the British Library. Turns out it was my favorite day of the 10 days I spent in the city.\n\n* **Schedule rest days:** If you\u2019re going to be doing these extended trips, you\u2019re going to need a lot of recharge time to ensure that you have the energy for the rest of the trip. The nightly recovery regimens help, but you should also schedule full recovery days (or days that are very light on activities). Introverts need a lot of downtime in order to ensure that they\u2019re functioning at optimal capacity when they get going. I certainly do. If I have a 3-week trip, I schedule at least two full days where I do nothing: one 6 days in and another 14 days in. Again, this might feel like an inefficient use of your time in the city, but remember, traveling is a delicate balancing act of time, energy, and money. Introverts and solo travelers need to be more aware of keeping these things in check than others, because they\u2019re usually just relying on themselves to get through the whole thing. \n\n* **Have a solo hobby:** Many people are totally fine just wandering around by themselves in a foreign place, but others need some sort of activity that anchors them to their surroundings. For me, it\u2019s photography. I like taking pictures of cool architecture and design. A simple thing like an archway in a bridge becomes a framing device to compose a photograph, a building with a glass facade next to a Victorian-era palace contrasts very nicely in an interesting shot, and I get excited on rainy days because it means more interesting photographs involving reflections, raindrops, and water puddles that create an overall moody vibe. I love photography because it allows me to see things differently and notice things that I normally wouldn\u2019t find so interesting. For others, this activity can be documenting their trip in a travel journal, writing/reading books, composing music, learning a language, or reading up on the history of the place they\u2019re in. Having a \u201cthing\u201d that you do can help give you a sense of purpose for those times that you feel like you could be doing something else or just feeling bored. \n\n* **Meetups:** So just because we\u2019re introverts doesn\u2019t mean we hate meeting up with people. We just don\u2019t like to do it all the time. Local subreddits and chat groups are a good way to schedule the meetup (check out /r/travelpartners). Sometimes specific countries have their own travel sub with a dedicated meetup thread (like /r/JapanTravel). A great way to start off is with a dinner commitment. We all need to eat at some point and you might as well share a meal for an hour with other solo travelers in town. This gives you a good sense of what these people are like and whether or not you\u2019d enjoy having them as a travel companion for a day or two while you\u2019re both there. I\u2019ve met up with people who were only interested in drinking and going to nightclubs, so I politely declined and moved on. On the other hand, I\u2019ve met up with really interesting people from around the world who recommended some really interesting and unique things in the city which I would have never found out about otherwise, and I\u2019ve met up with people who got along so well with my personality that we spent the rest of the time doing things in the city together. It\u2019s quite easy to tell what kind of a travel buddy someone will be after a couple of ice-breaker conversations with them over dinner, so I\u2019d highly recommend this format as a way of meeting people. It requires very little investment for what you get out of it. If you're down to spend the money, Airbnb Experiences are also a good way to meet others, but I haven't done this too many times, so can't exactly recommend it. If you have a niche hobby, look for a meetup in the city at [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/). You'll find lots of locals who can give you tons of great advice. I've only done this once but and ended up hitting it off with some cool history majors in Berlin who showed me around to some WWII-era underground tunnels the next day.\n\n* **Other solo travelers:** If you\u2019re looking for them, you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s lots and lots of solo travelers everywhere. It really isn\u2019t as weird as your friends and family might make it seem, and everyone\u2019s very willing to chat and entertain a fellow solo traveler for a while. I\u2019ve struck up conversations with other solo travelers while on hikes and had some very entertaining talks. Other solo travelers see me by myself all the time and ask me questions, which leads to conversations about plans for the day and dinner meetups later on. Never have I come across another solo traveler who has refused to answer a question or chat for a while. Even the ones who didn\u2019t speak English were extremely welcoming and hospitable. Another great way of meeting up with other solo travelers are the free \u201ccity walk\u201d tours that you see so often in the touristy cities. Almost every time, you\u2019ll see 4-5 people who are by themselves in the group of 16-20 people that show up for the tour. Befriend these people and talk to them in the walks from one spot to another as you get a sense of the city. Find out why they\u2019re there, what they do for a living, how long they\u2019re in town, etc. You might have more in common with them than you might expect. And then it\u2019s up to you whether you want to hang out with them after the tour ends or not. At one point in Prague, I met 5 other solo travelers in a 6AM city walk through Old Town and I got along so well with all of them that I ended up hanging out with them all day, until midnight. It was exhausting but a lot of fun. It was almost three years ago, and we all still keep in touch. \n\nSo yeah, there\u2019s the tips. For the non-introverts reading this, please understand that not all of of us are solo traveling to have social experiences. We\u2019re not against this by any means and it\u2019s great if it happens, but we tend to not force it and let it play out organically instead. To most people, spending so much money for extended international trips where you\u2019re just by yourself the entire time can seem like a huge waste of money (solo travel in a nutshell, am I right?). It can seem even weirder when you actively try to avoid social experiences and just want to be by yourself. But believe me when I say that it\u2019s completely normal. Everyone\u2019s brain is wired differently to crave and seek varying degrees of social-ness, and introverts in particular get a lot more out of seemingly mundane things like daydreaming on long walks in the city by themselves than they do from social activities like drinking with a group of strangers they just met at a bar. \n\nHope this has been helpful for other introverted solo travelers planning a trip or wondering whether or not they\u2019ll have \u201cfun\u201d if they don\u2019t meet up with anyone during the trip. Feel free to ask any other questions you might have (or add your own tips), and I\u2019ll do my best to answer them. Cheers and safe travels!\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks for all the great feedback! Glad to see this style of travel resonates with many of you. Remember, you don't need anyone else to validate that you had fun in the trip. It's your own style and you're doing your own thing. What's fun for you may not be fun for someone else. Thanks for being such a wholesome community &lt;3",

I'm also just starting to realise that I don't actually need to meet other people every single day. It's great to find other travellers or locals to hang out with, but if it doesn't happen, it's totally fine, too. I've discovered that I enjoy hiking or walking around by myself so much. And I especially like what you wrote about \"living like a local\", that's what I love doing as well! I go to bookstores and \"read\" the magazines in the local language I don't understand, lol.\n\nPersonally, I don't mind staying in hostels, I like the small talk with other travellers during breakfast/dinner. And when I lie in bed with my headphones on, I don't care what happens around me. Another option would be taking a private room in a hostel, if you still want to meet others but also want your own room.",

We also had a work event at a rock church called Temppeliaukio Church which ended up being a really sweet venue to be inside of. Oh, and I did do a sauna a couple of times, so relaxing.\n\nIt was a very cool city. It actually made me appreciate Finnish culture a lot and made me want to check out more of Finland down the line, especially the Lapland area.

Basically I need to do that while at home, so while traveling even more as the batteries drain faster! \n\nOne suggestion in regards to meeting people : couchsurfing hangouts is a pretty cool tool, very recommended. You mention reddit forums and meetup? Is that many people using them as a travel tool? (just genuinely asking). \n\nI also stay with couchsurfing hosts, although not that often. This can be a bit hardcore sometimes for an introvert, so I have to carefully chose a host. But it brings a special feeling and connection to humanity that I adore. \n\nAlso if I can ask, don't you feel lonely if a number of days passes and you do not have too much human interaction? I think about this when a day passes and I revisit my day and realize that I barely talked to anyone \n\nAlso I feel quite lonely when going on my own to a very touristic place (lasts one was Peterhof gardens in Saint Petersburg) where there are a lot of groups, couples, etc. All of them having a nice picnic, taking pics,etc. How do you deal with this situation? Do you avoid such places? ",

                    "comment": "&gt; Can you comment on your age?\n\nI'm 28 and male. I actually mentioned that in the post initially but removed it because I didn't feel it was too relevant, as the advice applies to almost anyone who just happens to be introverted. I've been solo traveling for most of twenties now and have never felt the need to go hard partying or drinking when I'm traveling. Something tells me the introversion is only going to get stronger as I get older, haha.\n\n&gt; You mention reddit forums and meetup? Is that many people using them as a travel tool? \n\nYep, subs like /r/travelpartners have meetup threads where you can post where you're going to be and others can chime in to schedule a time. Other countries have dedicated travel subs (like /r/JapanTravel) with their own meetup threads. I've done many group and solo meetups this way. Thanks for asking! I edited the original post with this.\n\n&gt; Also if I can ask, don't you feel lonely if a number of days passes and you do not have too much human interaction?\n\nIt does happen sometimes and it's just a part of the solo travel lifestyle. It can feel weird the first couple of times when everyone else around you seems to be chatting with someone and sharing their experiences and you're just by yourself eating at a restaurant, but the more you do it, the more comfortable you get with it. It's much easier for introverts to do this because we spend a lot of time by ourselves even when we're not traveling, so the solitude isn't exactly new to us, haha. Keep in mind that there's a difference between being alone and being lonely. Wanting to be by yourself doesn't necessarily lead to loneliness.\n\n&gt; Also I feel quite lonely when going on my own to a very touristic place (lasts one was Peterhof gardens in Saint Petersburg) where there are a lot of groups, couples, etc. All of them having a nice picnic, taking pics,etc. How do you deal with this situation? Do you avoid such places?\n\nYep, so this is the only downside of solo traveling as an introvert that I've experienced. You kind of have to go to cities and large metropolitan areas where it's easy to just be by yourself and wander around aimlessly. If you're going off the beaten path into smaller rural towns or places geared towards couples and family vacations, it gets much harder. For instance, I've always wanted to go to Greece and hop around the islands, but I'm finding it very difficult to plan this trip as a solo traveler. Same with Egypt, I want to rent a jeep and drive down the Nile from Cairo to Luxor, but it's proving to be quite challenging to plan this as a solo trip. I might just have to tag along with some friends who are also into this to do it. ",

Crete is wonderful: gorgeous coastline, interesting history and ruins, and criss-crossing the island from town to town using public busses is incredibly cheap and fun too. I loved Chania and Rethimnon (larger city-towns), but the little southcoast town of Pitsidias, with Matala beach and Komo (Minoan ruin) was unforgettable. Two entire weeks on Crete was not enough. In small towns, no problem at all finding very affordable accommodations, just follow the RENTROOMS signs. Grannies even wait at the bus station to make extra cash renting out their extra flat to tourists.",

Curious how much planning you had to do ahead of time and how much of it you can just wing as you go. I'm guessing it's a big enough tourist town that they've got good cafes, restaurants, and accommodations, right?",

Archaeology and pleasure was my reason for both stays in Crete with a colleague, and for me, the island of Santorini (the village of Ia) was a bucket-list camera destination too. Of course I read three guidebooks on Crete, but almost no advance planning on lodging was needed; cheap hotels are plentiful. We winged it. For me, small-town tavernas were the absolute best places. No menu. Waiter seats you at a table with your drinks, then gestures you to follow him to the stony kitchen out back. Mom pulls bubbling pans out of the oven, lifting lids, savory steam rolls in your face. You just point to the dishes you want. Dessert is always yogurt and walnuts drizzled with honey. \n\nI would love to see Crete again, ride motorbikes through the hot, dry plains and crumbling villages.  Near Gournia we picnicked, flaky greasy cheese pastries, apricots, dates and fresh cherries, on a farmer's rock fence containing ancient inscribed stones and column drums, nothing to hear but crickets and wind in the trees.  Of course see the capital city of Heraklion, and tour Knossos, it's commercial but very cool. but H. was too congested, noisy and ugly with concrete pillboxes.  On the south coast, I liked the site of Festos the best: a big rich hilltop villa with enormous pithoi still in place. And absolutely snorkel. Suncream, hat with a brim, and always carry water. In Crete the sun is like Africa. Beware the meltemi winds, straight off the Sahara.",

I love road trips, and have been really exploring America since 2011.  In 2012 I road-tripped In my tiny camper from Mexico to Canada and back along the Pacific coast using two-lane roads. Hot springs were a focus, and I enjoyed at least 12 (Sierra Nevada and Cascades Mountains are very volcanically active). I'm a girl of the western United States. California, Oregon and Washington (and Arizona, Nevada and Utah) are my home turf. For years I did month-long road trips in Mays and Septembers, before and after peak tourist season, because who wants to share incredible nature sites with crowds? In off-season, often I'd have *entire campgrounds all to myself.* No one even collecting money. With wild, natural hot springs, just for me! I drove Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic across the deep South once, that one was 38 days, also mostly along two-lane roads at an average speed of 40 miles an hour.  Good times.",

            "comment": "This is an absolutely fantastic write-up, thanks for taking the time to write it! Being an introvert, I can absolutely say that my most enjoyable trips recently have been the ones where I've taken my time and essentially lived in another place by doing the things I normally do, with some sightseeing sprinkled in. I had a day in Montreal where I woke up really not feeling the sightseeing thing, and I ended up buying a bunch of ingredients to make my own giant cheese and charcuterie plate and just sat in the hostel eating, reading, and binge watching RuPaul. Sometimes you just need those days--you are on vacation, after all!\n\nI think it helps to plan a trip with the mentality of \"I have all the time in the world,\" as opposed to the whole \"life is short, I gotta see everything!!\" mindset. I tell myself that if I happen to miss a \"must-see\" attraction in order to not over-exert myself, then that's totally okay. I feel like often times I've ended up \"guilting\" myself into doing something because I've been afraid that people who have been there are going to berate me for not having seen it, but...that's also kind of bullshit? If I'm not up for it, I'm not up for it and that's that, there's nothing wrong with that. I can always come back if I really want to see it that badly. Speaking of Montreal, I absolutely didn't see every \"must-see\" attraction, but I also knew from within the first couple of hours of being there that I was going to love the city and would be coming back someday. But, I also missed seeing the Gap of Dunloe in Ireland in favor of sleeping in instead, and I mean, if I end up back there, cool I'll go check it out, but I don't feel like I NEED to go back. You end up figuring out the difference.\n\nSomething I've struggled with, though, is the hostel vs Airbnb situation, as I also would prefer to stay in a nicer place with my own room, but I also really do want to meet people, so I end up staying in hostels that have pre-planned activities and such (and not every hostel has single rooms, or the single rooms end up being pricier than a much nicer Airbnb anyway, so I end up staying in a dorm). But I really like the tip about going on a city walking tour--that's a great idea, and I'll follow that advice in the future! So thanks!!\n\nThis was a well-timed post too, actually, I've been thinking about planning a two-week trip to the UK, and I've written up a very aggressive itinerary, but now I'm thinking about basing myself in a couple of cities instead because I know I'm just going to exhaust myself if I do that. So thanks for the friendly reminder. =)",

One of my favorite travel writers has a book called [AA Gill is Away](https://www.amazon.com/AA-Gill-Away/dp/0743276671) where this is his entire argument. You need to pace yourself and spend time in the cities. He makes a very strong case that if you haven't gotten bored in a city, you haven't quite experienced it. Check it out, it's great airplane reading :)\n\nWhen I was in Paris, I didn't even go to the Eiffel Tower until the day I was flying out. Stayed there for a total of 9 days and spent so much time wandering around the city that I left this until the end, haha. I definitely would've regretted it if I skipped out on it, so I'm glad I saw it up close. \n\n&gt; But I really like the tip about going on a city walking tour--that's a great idea, and I'll follow that advice in the future! So thanks!!\n\nYep, this is the first thing I do when I get into a city. Go to the downtown historic square and look for these. It's very easy to find them in touristy cities. I've made a lot of interesting acquaintances this way. I also like to ask the tour guides recommendations for lesser-known food or coffee spots so that I can check them out in the next few days. ",

Even the most basic advice will be really helpful.

There are a lot of Airbnbs these days which sort of function like hotels with their \"self check-in\" mechanisms. You just a code to get the key from a lockbox or you get an app which unlocks the smart lock on the door. In fact, the past 5 or 6 Airbnbs I've stayed at did not involve talking to a single person. They're tough to find on the site, but look for ones where the host isn't actually living in the same space and one that has self check-in features.",

One thing I would add is dining when solo travel might take a bit of research.  I travel to eat, so dining solo definitely takes getting used to, especially if the location places an emphasis on sharing a meal.  I do a bit of research to ensure they accept solo diners, and generally bring a book.  For very popular spots, I opt for a lunch instead of a dinner, or have an early dinner.  Overall this strategy has worked out well for me.",

There are certain European cities known for heavy pickpocketing and theft and you'll see people trying to scam you as well. The best thing to do is just pretend like you're a local. I do look up general directions ahead of time and like to just walk with purpose when wandering around. \n\nI've definitely had some intense encounters. I asked a guy for directions in Istanbul once and after showing me where to go, he told me to \"check out\" his uncle's carpet shop. He seemed super nice and the shop was literally on the street, so I went in as a sign of gratitude. They gave me tea and everything, which was nice. But they REALLY wanted me to buy a carpet. I was all \"no thanks, I don't have room to carry one\" and the uncle lost his shit. Fipped the tea over and started cursing extremely loudly. I got very uncomfortable and scurried out of there. \n\nIn Tokyo, I wandered off too far underground at one point and tried to go into a bar to check it out. There was a girl blocking the door and wouldn't let me in. After failing to communicate in sign language and awkward gesturing (I don't speak Japanese), I left. The next day, I looked up what the bar was and apparently I was in a neighborhood known to be operated by the Yakuza (Japan's mafia). It later became clear to me that the girl was looking for some kind of password to let me enter the place. If I had lingered around too long, I'm not sure what would've happened.\n\nThese things will happen from time to time, and you can't really predict them, but in my 6+ years of extensive solo traveling, I've had maybe 3 or 4 situations like this where I felt a little uncomfortable. I'm definitely less careful because I'm a guy and relatively young (28), but I've met up with tons of female solo travelers and from what they've told me, they just tend to be extra cautious when going to places alone. \n\nSome basic tips:\n\n* If you're a US Citizen, sign up for the [Safe Traveler Enrolment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) so that the nearest US Embassy can help you out if something goes wrong. \n* Look up general information like how to call the emergency hotline wherever you're at. \n* Memorize a path back to your hostel/Airbnb so that you can get back even if your phone dies.\n* Send a rough itinerary to people you know back home, so that they at least know where you were planning on being on specific days. \n\nBeyond that, know that people generally don't want to harm tourists because it'll give their country a bad image. If a newspaper headline shows up tomorrow morning screaming \"Tourist goes missing in Barcelona\", it gives the city a lot of bad press, and no-one wants that. So everyone tries to be generally helpful to tourists and wants to make sure that we go back to our country and say nice things about our trip. \n\nSounds like you haven't had the chance to do a whole lot of traveling yet, but just know that it's a lot safer than you might initially think. Once you do it a couple of times, you'll get very confident in your own abilities to look out for your own safety and wellbeing. Good luck!\n",

I've been traveling for 5 months now and pretty much did Japan and Cambodia on my own, whilst some things are definitely better with one other person or groups I feel like some of the best things have been solo! Pretty sure everyone needs time to just chill out by their selves, I always just have a few days here and there of wondering about on my own and chilling out after doing things in groups for a while. Also, there are plenty of hostels out there that you can still stay in for cheap and not be forced or feel pressured to socialise",

I didn't get to meetup with any people either. I wasn't really sure how to go about that. I suppose I kind of regret that. \n\nI strongly agree with creating the itinerary as you go. I would spend maybe 20-40 minutes in the morning while eating breakfast to decide what I was going to do first. Then the rest of the day it was whatever came to mind. \n\nI went to a Yoga studio pretty late, got a burrito and went back to the hotel. After I showered I remembered Powell's bookstore so I went there before even finishing my burrito. Bought a pizza slice from a local place across the street from the bookstore as well. \n",

I'm not saying that you have to become a social butterfly. Just challenge yourself a bit... Maybe stay in a dorm one night, then a private room  another night .

I found out just recently, when I took 10d to do touristy stuff in my home country for the first time, that there is basically a single cheap way to spend nights in Switzerland, and that's in a tent. If you need a hot shower, camping grounds cost 15.- to 35.- for a tent spot, and are easily accessible with public transport. In Zermatt for example the campground costs 15.- per night, there are no hostels, and the cheapest hotel is 150.- iirc. If you do wild camping, it's legal everywhere above the tree line. If you go anywhere else be sneaky. One fine = your budget.",

If it lines up with wherever you want to do extreme sports, there is an alternate way to get to Milan.  You can take the train from Chur to Tirano Italy.  It is a superb journey up high with stunning views.   Then you can take an Italian train that makes its way to Milan along the shores of Lake Como. \n\nIf you have enough time and enjoy good views when you are recovering from busier activities, it could be a good choice.",

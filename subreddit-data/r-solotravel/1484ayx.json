I\u2019m pretty physically fit, but thinking I\u2019d rather take the precaution than not. However I haven\u2019t found many companies offering a guided hike that\u2019s not a part of a larger tour. \n\nAnd anything else I should do solo in Amman before meeting up with the group?",

It concludes with a trip to the dead sea and then a resort close to it where you can grab food/dip in the pool to end the day. (I went to the Ramada Wyndham Dead Sea).\n\nGood thing was its right next to Hashem restaurant which is open 24/7 I think. Delicious falafel. \n\nI dont think you dont need a guide at Wadi Muji There are some gentle scrambling sections and where you have to climb a ladder/use a rope where there's an employee stationed to give an extra hand. Its a straight path so you can't get lost.  \n\n Make sure you try the knafeh at habibah sweets. They have a location in downtown amman. This video shows the spot I got the knafeh at.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nte7pfw364M",

            "comment": "From the airport, I recommend a ride-hailing service like Uber or Careem. About the same price as an airport taxi, but with added security. (Although, to be fair, I've been living in Amman for 15+ years and have never had an issue with an airport taxi... and while yellow taxis in Amman are generally good, I've admittedly had a few sketchy incidents over the years. I use Careem for everything now. Never have to wait more than 5 minutes for a car, at most. Usually 1-2 minutes on average. And good prices, good service.)\n\nIn Amman, definitely head to Jabal Weibdeh: it's a great neighborhood filled with restaurants, cafes, shops, art galleries, and good vibes (and great views of Downtown Amman and the Citadel). For food, try Rawan's Kitchen (\u0645\u0637\u0628\u062e \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646) for great local cuisine (different menu each day, and she serves up dishes until they run out, so go early) or Jordan Heritage Restaurant (what began as a project to preserve dishes and recipes from across the country has turned into a really unique restaurant).\n\nAs others have said, Downtown Amman is a must (Hashem and Habiba are institutions; go. Order everything). Also, the Jordan Museum is such a gem.\n\nFor Mujib, you should be fine actually. There are cabins/chalets right across the highway from the start of the trail that are great, and Mujib is a pretty well-worn hiking spot, with good tourist infrastructure. If you want to hire a guide, I believe you can do so through the staff at the chalets or on site at the activity center.\n\nI hike a lottttt in Jordan, all over the place, with another female friend. Both of us speak Arabic\u2014my friend is Jordanian-Polish and I'm American\u2014but we both look Eastern European as hell, and even in the most random places, we never face issues.\n\nJordan is an unbelievably warm, friendly, safe place. As a woman traveling solo, I would just recommend normal vigilance.\n\nhttps://www.dontfollowmetravel.com/blog/what-i-learned-from-a-wild-weekend-in-the-north-of-jordan\n\nhttps://www.dontfollowmetravel.com/blog/foraging-in-the-fertile-crescent\n\nhttps://www.dontfollowmetravel.com/blog/jordans-eastern-desert",

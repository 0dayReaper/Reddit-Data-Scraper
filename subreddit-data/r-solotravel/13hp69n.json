    "postText": "Just decided to take about 2 weeks off for the summer, so my planning is last minute and hoping to act fast (book flight by end of week).\n\nI (Brazil, SP) am thinking of going to Europe. Here\u2019s my rough idea:\n\nBudapest (4 days)\n\nPrague (3 days)\n\nVenice (4 days)\n\nNice (3-4 days)\n\nBarcelona (5 days)\n\nI like museums, parks, food, hiking, bars, meeting people and to some extent night life. So im more than open to any recommendation that falls in this scope.\n\nIm open to all opinions, i don't mind spending more time in one city than the other if you guys suggest. Only doubt at the moment is nice.\n\nThank you\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Im now going to Vienna for 3 days.",

            "comment": "Budapest and Prague, both fit your criteria and that's enough days. Venice is way too long, maximum 3 days but even then I'd consider cutting down to 2. There's not much to do in Venice, you can explore Venice in one day and save the next day to go to Murano and Burano. Same goes for Nice, 3 days max. 2 days in Nice and 1 day take a day trip to Monaco. Barcelona is perfect for 5 days, it's plenty big so you'll want as much time here as possible. \n\nIf you follow this plan, you'll save a couple of days where you could add another place to visit, e.g. Vienna or Bratislava, or any other places that fall close to your route.",

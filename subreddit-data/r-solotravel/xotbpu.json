    "postText": "\nSo I'm a Chinese Brit, I only speak English. I checked into a hostel (Turn Hostel in Ljubljana) which is attached to a pub called the England Pub. They're basically both the same business so the guy who works in the bar also works in the hostel.\n\nHe just completely randomly said \"ching chang chong\" to me about two hours after I had checked in while he was checking in on the mixed dorm I was in.\n\nTwo girls were also in the room at the time and they had heard too.\n\nI'm pretty sure I heard him say it but I didn't say anything as I'm not a confrontational person. But after five minutes I double checked with one of the girls if she had heard what he said and she said she heard the same.\n\nAnd the other girl (half asleep at the time) later on told me she had heard him say it too.\n\nI've left a bad review on Google and HostelWorld and also sent an email to the website but there was no manager at the time (maybe he was the manager idk) but there was only two of them working there at the time. Both also really unfriendly.\n\nJust thought I'd mention as I don't think they should be supported as a business whilst hosting a racist or someone that makes racist jokes.",

The waiting lasted for 30 mins to an hour until they motioned to us to come to the bar. We could get a room, where 2 other people were already staying.\n\nThe next morning, well actually literally at 4am. They let people into the room to use the unslept beds which were available. And spoke quite loudly with the guests while standing at the door. Those guests were gone by the time it was 10am.  And the whole stay they were just unfriendly anytime you asked them something",

So many \"Ni Hao\"s and laughing (I'm not even Chinese), a Russian dude tried to fight me and a girl said \"I don't speak Asian\", when I was speaking in a perfect North American English accent.\n\nThink it's a sign of the times after the whole COVID ordeal, just have to stand your ground, have tougher skin and do not put up with the casual disrespect. Asians are known for being soft so they try to poke fun of you.",

I do think Aussies are cool but no offense but Australians love to say a ton of racist shit and say it's part of their \"culture\" and that it's just a good laugh. I've heard some VERY racist comments from Australians about Asians that would not fly in the US and some had all sorts of weird things to say to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI doubt you would be able to guess where Westernized Asians come from because so much of the \"guessing\" comes from style and makeup...Korean Americans generally look super different from Koreans and you won't necessarily be able to \"tell.\" Just saying.

The majority has issues accepting anything that isn't standardized - that includes touchy subjects like races and sexuality as well as less touchy subjects like fashion and art. What makes it even worse, is the prejudice that feels like it's integrated in their culture and the overall lack of anything but the, once again, standardized knowledge. Hence why you were greeted with such a bullshit reaction (like the girl telling you that they don't speak Asian after hearing you talking).   \nBeing extremely proud and acting as if they know everything about everything (which in most cases turns out to be the exact opposite) doesn't help either.... Regardless, there are some of us that don't fall in that category and actually despise that kind of people (in my case to the point where I hate getting associated with this nation...).

He and I were traveling long term so sat separately for alone time, he was sitting directly in front of me.\n\nThe border guard who came on the bus to check passports took his American passport and began to grill him, seemingly not trusting his ID. My husband answered, but definitely was taken aback. \"Where areyou going? But where did you come from? For how long? Hmm\" suspiciously. He stared at his passport for too long. It was weird. The guard then moced on and checked my passport and realized, \"oh so you two are together?\" I answered yes and he seemed relieved like \"oh ok we're all good here then\". Since the brown guy was with a white girl he suddenly became \"acceptable\" it was sad really.\n\nA lot of people don't like to admit how racist Europe is, Western included, as they love to seem so  \"cultured from being steeped in so much history and art and bla bla\" but really, they're still behind in a lot of ways.",

I never interpreted this as an insult.  \n\nIts like a local tradition we had where people painted their face black, nothing racist behind it. Then Americans came and forced their culture (where blackface is extremely racist) and we had to stop doing it as well. A beautiful tradition ruined because people failed to understand cultural differences.\n\nYes, the hostel employee should know how to behave around tourists and shouldn't say that,but do you really think they tried to be hurtful by saying that?",

Kids are kids.  And if you want to go to places where there are racist and violent adults then you better be tough enough to handle them or know how to avoid confrontation.\n\nThe world is not always kind and understanding.

We have pretty big Asian communities throughout the country, so you're far less likely to hear the kind of bare faced racism that OP described anywhere you go. Its the second-most common ethnicity after your bog-standard White Anglo. Almost guaranteed never to happen in Sydney, Melbourne, or other big cities. \n\nMaybe in some bumfuck country town you could have the misfortune to come across on shithead, but even those places would be more likely to give you flack for thinking you're American before they'd ever pick on your race.",

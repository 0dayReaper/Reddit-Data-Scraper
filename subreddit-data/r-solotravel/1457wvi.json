    "postText": "1. Download WhatsApp \ud83d\udcf1  \nIn Mexico, WhatsApp is the primary communication tool, not just for chatting, but for making reservations or ordering services. Make sure you have it installed and familiarize yourself with its features.  \n2. Volunteer at a Local Community/Project \ud83e\udd1d  \nThere are many projects or local communities that welcome volunteers in Mexico. You'll get to learn new skills, contribute to a cause, and meet local friends. Check out Workaway for opportunities.  \n3. Follow the Mariachi Bands \ud83c\udfba  \nWhile in Guadalajara or Mexico City, find a group of mariachis and follow them from venue to venue. It\u2019s like having your own mobile concert while discovering local watering holes!  \n4. Try Pulque \ud83c\udf7b  \nPulque, an ancient drink made from fermented agave sap, has seen a revival in recent years. Seek out a local 'pulqueria' to sample this unique beverage - it's a cultural experience as much as a taste sensation!  \n5. Invest in a Local SIM Card \ud83d\udcf6  \nFor easier navigation, internet access and local calls, get a Mexican SIM card. Telcel offers a \"Sin L\u00edmite\" prepaid plan with calling, texting, and data.  \n6. Do Yoga in Tulum \ud83e\uddd8  \nJoin a drop-in yoga class at one of Tulum\u2019s many yoga retreats. You'll rejuvenate your body, mind, and soul while meeting like-minded travelers.  \n7. Take a Cooking Class \ud83c\udf73  \nImmerse yourself in the culinary wonders of Mexico by taking a local cooking class. You\u2019ll learn about Mexican cuisine, visit local markets for ingredients, and, of course, enjoy the fruits of your labor.  \n8. Always Keep Small Change \ud83d\udcb0  \nAlways have coins or small bills handy. Many small shops or street vendors might not have change for larger bills.  \n9. Join Free Walking Tours \ud83d\udc5f  \nMexico's major cities often offer free walking tours. They're a great way to orient yourself, learn local history, and meet fellow travelers.  \n10. Attend a Lucha Libre Match \ud83e\udd3c  \nFor a uniquely Mexican experience, attend a Lucha Libre (Mexican wrestling) match. It\u2019s full of action, drama, and fun. Don't forget to buy a wrestler mask as a memento!  \n11. Hammock is Your Best Friend \ud83c\udf33  \nIf you're an outdoor lover, consider bringing a lightweight hammock. You can hang it at beaches, parks, or even in some hostels!  \n12. Know Where to Find Clean Restrooms \ud83d\udebb  \nHigh-end restaurants, cafes, and international fast-food chains usually have clean toilets. A cup of coffee or an ice cream cone can be your \"restroom fee\".  \nDo you have other Mexico-specific hacks to add? Don't hesitate to contribute to this thread. Let's make it the ultimate guide for solo travelers to Mexico! \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd",

I went out for breakfast with friends and ended up about a 30 minute drive from where I was staying.  I was sitting outside and could feel the sun beating down, I started to sweat and get very uncomfortable.\n\nI waited to ask where the bathroom was as the staff were all very busy.  Finally,  I was directed to the washroom,  way in the back terrace, at this point sweating badly and desperate.  At first I couldn't find it and frantically kept looking,  there was no one around to point it out. There was a door,  tucked away in a corner and behind it a single toilet.  I relieved myself and realized there was no toilet paper.  All I had was my well used surgical mask in my pocket which I was forced to use and felt gross on many levels.  \n\nThe trash was overflowing but I managed to not have to put the mask down the drain. When I looked for the handle to flush the toilet,  it was missing.   I panicked and lifted the lid but only saw a ribbon tied to the chain and valve.  I put my hand in the tank water,  pulled the ribbon and thanks to everything holy the toilet flushed so I did not kill the next person who went in there.   There was no sink, no soap just a tap and bucket next to the toilet that I used to rinse my hands. I had some hand sanitizer and used it as well. After I found out there was another washroom in a different area of the restaurant (which my friend said was clean and well stocked) but I had gone to the one that was out of order.  Desperation got the best of me here and my friends and I all had a good laugh \ud83d\ude02.",

There's also water delivery company's that'll deliver or you can get them at oxxo or a grocery store. I use bottled water for teeth brushing, my wife uses tap water. Some towns run the water pipe and sewer pipe through the same conduit under the sidewalk and you'll occasionally notice the smell of sewage if you're out walking, so it's possible to have mixing down there. That means that even if the town has a brand new water treatment plant it could be contaminated by the time it gets to your hotel or house.",

San Cristobal, San Jose, etc are single digits celsius at night. \n\nAlso if you're in San Cristobal don't even brush your teeth or wash your fruit with tap water - or your shit will run at the same consistency as said tap water. \n\nIf you do the CDMX ---&gt; Oaxaca bus - do it during the day time and sit on the right hand side. It's not QUITE long enough for a night bus, and it traverses some stunning scenery en route. \n\nDon't eat the hostel breakfast - there's a very high chance there is a tamale vendor within a block of you at any point in the morning. They start selling early (like 7am) and then go home when they're sold out. The majority of people I met this trip didn't really venture out until AFTER breakfast and thus missed out on this iconic food - and get a cup of Atole alongside it. I also found Tamale one of the safest street foods due to it being steamed right then and there, and maintained at a rather hot temperature.",

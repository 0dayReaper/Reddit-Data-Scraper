We had a wonderful time together, but we all took a day or afternoon where we each went off on our own. We all live alone and after a week of travel together we needed a little alone time even if it was just to get a coffee solo or take a walk around the block.",

Then when you get back maybe they'll be ready and you won't feel like you've wasted your day and you get some alone time to refresh. Also they really can't complain if you come back late and they have to wait on you since you've been waiting on them the entire trip. Maybe also plan some things to do solo. Choose something that doesn't peak their interest, or that is kinda far to walk. Don't phrase it as if they're not invited or as if it were a group plan, just keep it neutral so they don't get offended \"I'm going here to do this, its a 30 min walk so I'm fine with going on my own.\"",

That\u2019s definitely a benefit of solo travel, you never risk having a bad travel experience because of other people.\n\nOn the other hand, sometime you should try and put together a group that appreciates travel the same way you do and go on a trip together. That can be really fun and it sounds to me like you\u2019ve been stuck with a bunch of friends that just happen to not be very open to traveling!\n\nBest of luck on the rest of your trip!\n\nEdit: I\u2019d also have a talk with them about some of the more rude aspects of their behavior.

In Chile, my go-to item at McDonald's that I don't think is on the menu in the U.S. was the Pollo Bacon sandwich, which had a chicken patty, cheese, and bacon (along with lettuce, tomato, and mayo). When I went to Buenos Aires, Argentina, the chicken patties (like on McChicken sandwiches) reminded me a lot more of the chicken that is used in McNuggets, which seems to taste quite different from the chicken used in sandwiches in the U.S.\n\nAlso, in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, McCaf\u00e9 is fancier than in the U.S.  They have a separate counter for it and sell some pastries in addition to beverages.",

Come to a compromise? Say, you wanna see La Sagrada Familia and spend more time there, tell them that you can rendezvous back at a particular point later in the day. Suggest but give them options: like two options that you wanna do. If they say they\u2019re fine with anything, just decide on what YOU want to do. \n\nBut yes ultimately SOLO travel or traveling with like-minded friends is the BEST. All the best, and enjoy Barca!",

Go do your things alone in the morning and then go meet up with them.\n\nFind out what places they want to actually go to, and save that for with them. Don't tell them the places that they should go see, let them tell you. Otherwise, they'll either say yes to everything (and take it off your list) or they'll just say yes and not care when they get there. Let them decide what they want because then they'll have more of an interest in it.\n\nThen, do the rest by yourself. Meet them for lunch. If they want Chipotle, let them have it. Just don't eat with them, tag along for the lunch and just get a drink. Pick something else up along the way (Spain has a lot to handheld foods like sandwiches that are easy).\n\nBasically, compromise some, but don't ruin your trip. Do your own things, don't force people up. Plan to go back to the rooms at a certain point but don't wait for them. Be in contact with them and let them know where you will be (not where you are currently or you'll be waiting there forever for them). Don't cater to them, just do your own thing but always be open to meeting up when they are ready.\n\nYou'll get much more out of the trip, and won't stress as much. They'll enjoy their peace and quiet and tensions will die down.\n\nAlso, drink lots of wine at night.",

What I learned very quick is to tell them to go ahead without me and I will meet up with them once I\u2019m finished getting ready. I can\u2019t stand people having to wait for my slow ass to get ready. \n\nAt first they were like, \u201cno we will wait for you.\u201d But I insisted they please go ahead without me bc I don\u2019t want to drag everyone behind and that I totally understand and don\u2019t mind if they leave first. If I miss something they see early, that\u2019s the price I pay for taking so long. I won\u2019t be mad about it. \n\nThen I finish getting ready in peace and meet and catch up with them full of energy and fun for the rest of the day. \n\nI\u2019ve done this multiple times and it works like a charm. Now it\u2019s just known that I will meet up later. \n\nThe one thing I can\u2019t stand though are complainers. I\u2019ve traveled with people who complain (about food, walking, comparing things to the states in a negative way, complaining and arguing with their boyfriend back home, etc). I will not hang out with or travel with complainers. There is going to be shit that happens and it\u2019s fine! Planes will be delayed, trains get missed, internet is slow, batteries not charged, service takes a while, or whatever.

That's what I do with my friends, but also look for some casual little me moments. Like in the moring going for breakfast or when they are in hungover mode.\n\nThat said, tonight you should go to the Barri de Gr\u00e0cia. This week they celebrate their neighbourhood \"fiestas\" and today is the last night. They decorate all the streets in a crazy way and there is beer and live music in every corner.\n\nAlso, it is a good place to get lost and spent some time alone while talking to random drunk locals.

I mean, he was loud, rude, disrespectful, everything.  \n  \nWe were queuing for Auschwitz, and he spoke SO loud, and even mimicked some highlights of his football match, with big gestures and all, and people were just staring at him in disbelief, and he didn't seem to care or notice... We were in line to visit a concentration camp ffs...  \n  \nThen in the streets, we walked past a girl who was wearing leggings, and he said VERY LOUD \"damn dude chick wearing leggings make me hard\", as if polish people wouldn't understand what we were saying, let alone the WORD \"LEGGINGS\" WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH USED EVERWHERE. I felt so bad for the girl who obviously noticed he said this.  \n\nNot to mention how he complained about people snoring in hostels. Like dude... I brought you some earplugs. And it's a hostel god dammit. So to take revenge, he would open/close the door (which made a high pitched nose), at midnight while some people were already asleep (or trying to fall asleep) seeming to have forgotten cigarettes, jacket, keys... While I was waiting for him at the reception.\n  \nThen we met some people, and he kept making some terrible jokes and teasing them. Oh and as he saw they were not laughing he tried the SAME fucking joke TWICE and then pretended he was trying to get on their nerves on purpose... It was a disaster.  \n  \nThen we went to a karaoke bar in Krakow, I was having so much fun watching polish people sing polish songs, trying to make sense of this alien language, enjoying my 5 zloty (1\u20ac) pints, and just getting myself immersed in this culture I was just discovering. He kept complaining the entire time, trying to make fun of the locals for their \"terrible taste in music\", the people we had met were barely paying attention to him at this point.  \n  \nAt the end of the night, he said that it was one of the worst nights of his life because he didn't manage to pick up a chick, or to put it in his words : \"man they all got a stick up their asses in this fucking country, we should have gone to a strip club\". Right there I knew I would never EVER travel with him again.  \n  \nTerrible experience overall. Poland was an 8, he made the overall experience a 2.  \n  \nSolo travel for life baby.",

I\u2019d take a shower, wash my face, put on makeup and sometimes by then someone would be awake. I know I left the Airbnb by myself at least one or two mornings. I ate breakfast at a small lounge nearby. Talked to the owner around my age about all sorts of things. She was so sweet. Maybe you can leave early to get breakfast and go back? I know when I returned they still weren\u2019t ready to leave. Or just have a day by yourself. I find the more people on a trip the more chaotic it is.\n\nOne day we were going to go to a temple. I think this might have been the day I ate breakfast alone or with one other friend. It was rolling around 12 and the one girl still needed to shower and then put make up on. Granted she had health issues that also caused an understandable delay. But I got tired of waiting and went to Harajuku alone for the day. I then headed to Akihabara and messaged my friends asking if anyone would join me. One friend did. He was happy I wanted to do something because everyone else wanted to go back and sleep. It was 6pm! I know jet lag sucks but come onnnn lol\n\nAnd ughhh Jesus Christ with Snapchat. I used Instagram during my trip but posted my pictures on my downtime.

Done being a nice person, I just told her to please read all the info that was given. I\u2019m not an annoying person and hate to be one. Chasing someone to book a hotel for things to be planned out properly is just plain stupid.",

Their negative energy kinda rubbed off on me so I didn\u2019t really enjoy my first visit. Last week I went back by my self and had the time of my life (literally). Got to meet a bunch of random people at an event that we\u2019re all exited to be chilling in California. Did whatever I wanted, stayed where ever I wanted, and ate where I wanted. On the flight back I had a smile on my face because that was the very first time I had actually had fun on a trip. Solo trips are cool and all but if I had I chance I\u2019d bring a friend or two along that are just as exited.",

They certainly sound like it. Been there several times, and always got the feeling that the city was made for solo travel or for travel with folks who are looking to actually see and explore. You meet awesome people from all over the world on the city's streets. \n\nWhat could be one of the coolest cities in the world does not have to be ruined by a group of whiners. Also, you're free.

It got expensive, staying in an Airbnb myself with nobody to split costs, but it was nice and different not having to respond to anyone else's needs but my own.\n\nI loved being alone, but part of me felt empty... Like I should be experiencing it with someone as well. Maybe I will get lucky and find a partner who loves to travel and isn't one to stick to the norm and enjoys trying new things in new places.

Eventually i had very few time left to discover the places wherever i go. Also some of them have totally different expectation from a city trip.. One wants see a Football game of the town even they play in the 3.league while other is only interested with the night life (so prefers to wake up in the afternoon). \nOf course being alone during a trip may bring some difficulties but in general i believe that it does not make sence to travel with someone only you know with each other. It is also possible to meet ppl with the same expectations during the trip. I live in Nuremberg, Germany and looking for new places to travel, no matter how touristical it is or not.",

Lifelong friendships evolve and the older you get, the more you change and some people become set in their ways.  They can be judgmental. Or controlling. I bet this even happens with hipsters and millennials and any other younger sub categories you can think of.  Keep your travel circle small so you can keep your adventures wide!",

As others have said, let them know your morning plans 'I'm leaving for x at y'. Or meet up for lunch or dinner. Give them a time and a place.  \nOf course group travel is all about give and take.  \n\nIn regards to fast food - I'll do it once or twice on my trip. I love eating local food, but sometimes I'm beyond hungry and need food RIGHT NOW, or sometimes I just really feel like esting something familiar.",

Would have probably killed them otherwise, or never would be able to talk to them again. \n\nI've just decided to never go on an extended holiday with them again, maybe a weekend trip would be okay.

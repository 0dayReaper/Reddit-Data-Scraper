    "postText": "Hi guys, I've never really been to Hawaii before... and I haven't been on a vacation in long time, as I never had anyone to go with... but I've recently got over my fear of solo vacationing, and I'd like to plan to trip to finally see Hawaii! The thing is, I'm not quite sure which island I should be moving forward with, as my priorities are a bit different than those discussed in the typical \"which island should I visit guides\".\n\nI'm a solo traveler, I like being around other people... but I'm also not the most outgoing either. Ideally I'd be spending half of my time doing guided, group experiences (thinking of surfing lessons, diving lessons, group kayaking tours, and nature tours). The other half of my time I will spend chilling on the beach, swimming in the water, and enjoying upscale restaurants &amp; bars.\n\nIt seems like Oahu would probably have everything I'd be looking for, and at a more affordable price... but I'm not sure what to expect with regards to crowds. I like being around other people; I don't want to feel like I'm alone in some secluded place... but large crowds, especially on the beach, are overwhelming to me. One final factor to mention is that I don't like driving when I'm on vacation. So wherever I go needs to either be walkable or easily accessed by shuttles or taxis/uber/etc.\n\nWith that in mind, what do you think the better choice for me would be?\n\n**Sidenote:** I'm also concerned about getting my stuff stolen on the beach, as I won't have enough person to watch my stuff while I go in the water. Are there any places that have beachside security or private beaches?",

            "comment": "Oahu will be a way better choice if not driving. We have a great bus system that can take you all over the island to see major attractions and off the beaten as well. You can purchase a Holo card at any 7-11 and load funds for the bus $3 single trip or $7.50 all day. \n\nFor activities you can get to fairly easily are,\n\n. Polynesian culture center (long bus trip) look into this as a guided and you can catch a large coach with groups from Waikiki. \n\n. Arizona memorial and battleship Missouri \n\n. Kualoa Ranch. Many types of great adventures activities guide large and small group\u2019s available. There great with for solo travelers as the guides can fit you into the groups fine.\n\n. Aloha stadium swap meet. (Great for souvenirs and deals) \n\n. Manoa falls for a great hike that will always have some people on it so you don\u2019t have to worry much about hiking alone. \n\nDepending on where you stay there are a lot of beautiful beaches depending on what your looking for. I recommend heading over to Kailua town for beautiful sand beaches and places for great lunch and walk around many shops and get a shave ice. A day trip up to Haleiwa town is a great idea too. If you come during winter months you may see some surf contest or really large waves to watch at Waimea or pipeline. If looking for some nice fine dining and exotic food flair your looking at Waikiki or downtown Honolulu, lots of Asian flair and fusion restaurants to checkout. Also the best place for a good cocktail. If possible I\u2019d recommend staying outside of Waikiki. If you can find a short term Air BnB would be best. I\u2019ll message you about that. Hostels are far and few between on Oahu. Aulani the Disney resort or Ko Olina is an option far out on the west side. But very pricy.  Waikiki is not all bad I just don\u2019t recommend Spending a lot of time there that will be your most crowded place. But can be interesting to walk Waikiki strip on a Saturday night and people watch.  Message me if you got some questions I\u2019ve lived on Oahu for 32 years. \n\nAloha",

Ideally I'd be getting an Airbnb for somewhere between 1-2 weeks; someplace that is in walking distance to a beach, and nearby to good food &amp; drink.\n\nI haven't really been considering hotels, as they usually (never?) have california king beds, and as a tall guy I wouldn't enjoy myself if I spent the entire trip getting bad sleep.

Waikiki beach is a major city and it is crowded and busy like any other downtown. But there are tours that take you to other, more secluded parts of the island. \n\nMaui was all driving. The airport is in the valley and the hotels are along the coast. I went before the days of uber so it might be a little different now but I can't see it being very easy to get around Maui without a car. Maybe if there is a shuttle to the hotel, and then tours/shuttles from the hotel, it could work. I think generally, you're on the right track with Oahu, but maybe someone who has been there more recently will have better advice.",

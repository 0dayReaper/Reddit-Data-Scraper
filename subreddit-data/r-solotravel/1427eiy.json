    "postText": "Hi all. I semi-spontaneously decided to do 3 weeks in Italy this July. I love ancient history and studied it in college, so Italy has always been a dream destination of mine.\n\nThings I'm interested in for this trip: Culture/history, food, hiking. Mostly in that order. I tried to get a mix of the major history culture destinations (including the big three obvs: Rome, Florence, and Venice), some smaller towns for a change of pace, Bologna for a food + partying break, and some nature at Lake Como and the Cinque Terre. \n\nMy current plan is:  \nDay 1: Arrive in Milan in the morning, explore during the day (1 night).  \nDay 2-4: Lake Como (2 nights).   \nDay 4-5: Verona (1 night).   \nDay 5-7: Venice (2 nights).   \nDay 7-10: Bologna (3 nights).   \n- Day trip to Modena for one of the days.   \nDay 10-14: Florence (4 nights).   \n- Day trips to San Gimignano and Lucca.  \nDay 14-15: Siena (1 night).  \nDay 15-17: Cinque Terre (2 nights)   \nDay 17-21: Rome (4 nights).  \nDay 21: Fly back home from Rome.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions? Places that I missed, or that I'm allocating too much or too little time towards? Thanks in advance.\n\nAlso, any suggestions for recommended hostels/places to stay at any of the destinations would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\n\nEDIT:   \nConsolidated this based on everyone's suggestions to reduce transit time and give myself more time in Rome. Lake Como was the main loss, but I think I can live with that.\n\n\nDay 1: Arrive in Milan in the morning (1 night).  \nDay 2-4: Venice (3 nights).   \nDay 5-7: Bologna (3 nights).   \n- Day trip to Modena/Maranello for one of the days to see Ferrari things.  \nDay 8-12: Florence (5 nights).   \n- Day trips to San Gimignano, Siena, and (lowest priority) Lucca.  \nDay 13-15: Cinque Terre (3 nights)   \nDay 16-21: Rome (6 nights).  \n- Day trip to Ostia Antica (some ancient ruins, given I wasn't able to fit in Pompeii).  \nDay 21: Fly back home from Rome.",

            "comment": "Idk where you're coming from and if you have a jetlag, but flying in and immediately seeing a city where you only have 1 day sounds rushed.\n\nIt's also good to look at travel times. If you have 1 night somewhere, you don't have any full days there. 2 nights is just 1 full day. You have a few places where you only have 1 night. For example for Verona, you'll spend day 4 packing your stuff, checking out the hostel, getting breakfast, going on public transport, checking into your new hostel, then seeing the city for a few hours and the next day you can do all of that all over again because you're moving on to Venice. If I were you I'f try to go a bit slower and have more nights in the same spot.\n\nFor example, maybe do Siena as a daytrip from Florence, so you don't have to switch hostels as much. Or double check if you really want to see all of these cities and are ok with skipping some of them or saving them for another trip.\n\nAlso - july is hot and busy in Italy so you might want to relax a bit more",

I kinda like the idea of sleeping in some of the small towns, but it's true that I'll get tired of constantly being in transit.\n\nedit:\n&gt; Idk where you're coming from and if you have a jetlag, but flying in and immediately seeing a city where you only have 1 day sounds rushed.\n\nRegarding this - Milan is basically going to be my \"chill out, mild sightseeing, and sleep in a nice hotel to prepare for the trip\" day. I'm not really intending to do a full day of tourism there. Based on most other people in this sub, it seems like a clean and liveable city, but less interesting for tourists.",

It\u2019s not far from Venice, and I\u2019m not sure two nights in Venice is enough \u2014 but that\u2019s just me. \n\nThree nights in Bologna seems like way too much, unless you have a specific interest there. And I think it\u2019s about 40 minutes from Florence. \n\nIt\u2019d involve less moving from hotel to hotel if you were just to stay in Florence for a week or so, and take day trips from there \u2014 including to Siena, it\u2019s not far. \n\nAlso for your day in Milan, make sure to book a ticket for the Last Supper ahead of time. The number of people they let in is limited. I\u2019ve also been reading that Rome is packed this year (even more than usual), and you need to book tickets for most things ahead of time.",

I think I'll take your suggestion and consolidate that day into Venice, with Verona as an optional day trip. It's also true that given how hot and crowded everything is, I'll prefer having the opportunity for some chiller days in the city.\n\nWith Bologna, the one thing I did want to see was the Ferrari museum in Maranello (as part of the Modena daytrip). That eats up a day, but as a big F1 fan, it seems worth it to me.\n\n&gt; It\u2019d involve less moving from hotel to hotel if you were just to stay in Florence for a week or so, and take day trips from there \u2014 including to Siena, it\u2019s not far.\n\nThis makes sense.

And if being able to get away from crowds a bit is important to you, it\u2019s doubly important to be in Venice longer. That place can be an absolute nightmare in the daytime with all the tour groups from the cruise ships, and utterly charming early in the morning or late at night. \n\nYou can easily get to Maranello from Florence by train as well. It\u2019s not as fast as the high speed from Florence to Bologna, but personally I think if somewhere is less than a couple of hours and you can see everything you want in a day, it\u2019s not worth the hassle of switching hotels. Obviously that\u2019s subjective though!",

    "postText": "I always loved to roam. When i was 18 and 19 i hitchhiked 20,000 miles in north america. Later life got complicated by some personal tradgedies/ obstacles (maybe i shouldn't have stopped and let life happen!). But, still i managed to travel more than many people do.   \n\n\nAt any rate, 2 years ago, my older brother was diagnosed terminally ill at 55 and died in diapers not knowing anyone's name. Until this time, i thought i would live to 100 (my brother's rare disease has no precedence in our family) as my father plays tennis at 90 yo and takes no meds and my relatives seem to live a long time.. But, my brother's passing and covid encouraged me to increase my travels.  \n\n\nAT any rate, i now have upped my game. I am single with no kids ,so have more freedom than most people. I dont have instragram and dont brag or make people look at my pics. All i do, is post a small portion of my photos on facebook, as i have gotten into travel photography.  \n\n\nwell, the envy and drama has been a bit much. As soon as i let on i a going somewhere my siblings book trips and call to tell me. My cousins confronted me at a family reunion this month and asked \"what are you trying to do\" and telling me how good their lives are. commentslike \"you spent two weeks in paris last year? havent you been there before? \"as if one trip to paris shold seal the deal.  \n\n\nI try to reassure them and play it down. I say i dont like golf, fishing and dont have kids. But, i wish they would just stay out of it. I dont complain that they have family lives. Or that they have more established careers and relationships.  \n\n\nThe thing is. I know it is going to get worse, because i am about to start doing it more. I now have learned not to say anything about a trip until i am about to leave. I then casually let it be known i will be away so that they can find me.",

I don't post travel photos on Facebook because a lot of my Facebook friends are people I haven't spoken to for 10+ years - people who probably have no reason to be interested in my vacation photos, and might just find the photos annoying or braggy. \n\nIt also might be worth trying to talk to your relatives about boundaries if you think they'll listen. As adults they shouldn't be getting all insecure and weird about your vacations.",

Keep doing what you are doing and ignore what other people think of it?\n\nNot really any other options for me.Maybe try to take more interest in what other members of your family are doing,so they don't feel so jealous?

That headstone is supposed to say this:\n\n\"She was all in.\"\n\nThat's my advice - live your life all in  :)",

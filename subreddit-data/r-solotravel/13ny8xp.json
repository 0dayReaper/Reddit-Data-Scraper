(First time solo traveling)\nI\u2019m a Spanish girl, turning 19 on the 3rd of June and i\u2019m going to Prague 7 days by myself to celebrate it. \nI\u2019m staying at a hostel, my plan is just eating good, discovering the city, raving ;), thrifting and i\u2019m thinking on paying for a whole day tour in the Bohemian Switzerland (Most importantly i\u2019m using this trip as a way to dig deep into myself before moving out and starting my adult life in September, going out of my comfort zone meeting people bc i\u2019m an introvert and having loads of fun) \n\nFeel free to throw whatever advice or information you want my way!! :))))))",

Haven't watched it for a few years but they used to share tips (where to eat, \"secret\" gems...) and warn of common tourist scams. \n\nKarl\u0161tejn is a monumental castle under an hour by train from Prague, located in beautiful ladscape next to the Berounka river. A bit touristy but worth it. Czech Switzerland is nice (Prav\u010dick\u00e1 br\u00e1na really is impressive).\n\nIf you are a student and have the ISIC card, you should be able to buy a monthly ticket in advance for public transport in Prague. It's ridiculously cheap (it costs less than a lunch). Weekly tickets for students aren't available and regular adult ticket will cost you more.\nMy personal favourites in Prague are Pet\u0159\u00edn, the Prague Castle, Nov\u00fd sv\u011bt, Vinohrady... And there surely are some thrift stores worth checking out. Enjoy your time here! If you had any other questions, feel free to ask :)",

Telc and Cesky Krumlov are absolutely worth a day trip but you could spend seven days easily in Prague, these seven days will be over before you know it in this amazing city.

The metro and tram network is fantastic, just don\u2019t forget to validate your ticket in the machine. It\u2019s also very walkable and I thoroughly enjoyed just walking around different neighbourhoods and discovering hidden gems. The Jewish quarter, mala strana and vino hrady are good neighbourhoods to get lost in. \n\n\nYou should definitely walk up to Letna park one afternoon for beautiful views of Prague and in summer - beer gardens, food and lots of people having picnics etc.",

I made that mistake and got stopped by the police and fined 1000 czk.\n\nI stayed at Madhouse Prague after seeing how it was popular on this subreddit. Be prepared, it\u2019s a party hostel. If raving is what you want, they can supply a party to you every night of the week haha. They also host family dinners for 100 czk and cook food for you (vegetarian) and then start drinking after. Out of all the bars and clubs I went to, I liked Dog Bar a lot because it was the least like it is back home (I\u2019m from the US). It\u2019s 250 czk to get in but you get a card with that amount on it and the beer is really cheap. You know you are in a tourist trap if the beer is more expensive than the water.\n\nAs for day time things, I checked out Prague castle and some of the hikes around the city. For thrifting I actually went to Prague 7 to find some shops and found a really small one that had a nice windbreaker. \n\nIf you have any more questions about the city just let me know!",

They'll scam you 99% of the time in Prague. They sit outside the hostels late at night and try to sell you bullshit, and other solicitors will try to bring you on bullshit \"experiences\" or \"clubs\"",

If you haven't booked your flights yet, might be able to save money by flying into Prague and flying out of a different city.\n\nI wasn't dying to go to Italy but have never been before and found a flight from there to New York City for $350 so flew back from Italy.",

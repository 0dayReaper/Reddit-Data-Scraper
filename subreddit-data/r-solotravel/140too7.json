If anyone has any experience please share!\n\nOn the one hand, I intend to stay in hostels, and I instinctually try to avoid spending money. On the other, I'd like to eat out for every meal (possibly except breakfast on some occasions), I plan to do some drinking, I am new to solo travel (meaning I'll likely waste money), and I'm not going to try very hard to limit my spending. Would, for example, 3000 dollars (excluding the flight) be enough to comfortably spend 12 days traveling through the country?",

I had a great time exploring all the beautiful Christmas markets, especially the main market at the Cathedral. The city and the people were equally charming even though it drizzled almost every day. The city also has efficient connectivity so going from one market to the other was super easy. I have half a mind to go back again however I want to explore another city given it should equal Cologne's Christmas-sy, festive feel and convenience while commuting. Germany in general is popular for having the best Christmas markets so I am keen on Dresden, Essen or Nuremburg but I am also looking at Vienna and Salzburg outside Germany which (based on the reviews) are quite similar.   \nDates will be from Dec 15 to Dec 26. I believe this may give me enough time to explore more than one city however I wouldn't want to do more than 2.   \nSorry if I have started planning my trip way in advance but I am one of those who is more excited about Christmas and winter holidays than summer!   \nWould love to hear your experience if you have spent Christmas in any of the above cities.",

The dream is Middle East, Central and SEA, Central Africa, South and Central America. The fear and doubt definitely kicking in. What if its all hyped up?\n\nI have a 3 months notice period on my job and apartment, so I'm getting to the point where I soon have to figure out when to quit my job and cancel the apartment.\n\nAnyone else gone through this before a long trip and have some advice where to start?\n\n*I did solotravel in my 20s and studied abroad.

It may be as simple as applying for an eVisa online, which you can do anywhere. But if visiting an embassy in-person is needed, or anything more complicated like that, it might be a bit weirder or harder to get a visa while already abroad. (2) packing for multiple climates is very much possible but just has to be taken in to consideration (3) travel medicine (required vaccines not just for one specific region but for everywhere you want to go) (4) handling taxes and stuff from abroad, may want to file for an extension or be prepared to file while out of the country\n\nOtherwise I think the most important thing to be planning ahead for is sustainability and pacing. Can't travel on a longterm trip the way you do on a two-week trip. Time to rest and recover is very important, as is having regular ways to unwind and relax and recharge, keeping in touch with loved ones, etc.\n\nFor the sake of budgeting as well as pacing it can pay off to give yourself a lot of time in fewer countries rather than planning to spend less time in many countries. For my (partially ruined by covid) longterm trip, my plan was (mostly) giving myself a full month per country. I bought all plane tickets in advance, and figured out almost all of the rest of the plan on-the-go.",

It's a beautiful, surreal, strange place, but is expensive to visit, both because lodgings are pricey and because you're not allowed to leave the only town there without a guide because of polar bears.

But I appreciate I am saying that as someone comfortable in the surroundings of a city I know well. Unless you\u2019re arriving very very early or very very late, it\u2019s a busy area with lots of tourists, locals, well lit roads etc so I personally wouldn\u2019t worry. If I arrived in a city needing to find my hotel I would normally write out the route, so you\u2019re not walking along holding your phone which could be vulnerable to being snatched.  If you do get there and don\u2019t feel comfortable, there will be plenty of taxis (black cabs) around.   \n\n\nCant comment much on the London pass, but I suppose I would weigh up how many attractions I am likely to do in a day/two days and calculate the price separately. It might feel a bit rushed to do multiple big attractions in one day - but you know your pace. There\u2019s probably some more informed blog posts about whether the pass is worth it or not.",

The image I have of London is a city that if I don't look at my luggage for 3 seconds it's gone. I'm also kinda worried about the stab situation. I won't leave the Heathrow airport, so it should be something to worry about?\n\nI'll have 2 days in Brighton, what should I visit?\n\nShould I bring anything for my own safety? I don't look British at all, so I'm worried I might be looked at like an easy target, I know self defense weapons are illegal, but maybe a key ring that beeps loudly when touched is a good idea?\n\nHow do I contact hotels?

I advise using a website like booking dot com, or using Google maps and finding the hotel's website and booking on there. There's no need to phone or email. \n\nLondon is generally quite safe. The stabbings that happen are gang related and don't affect tourists at all. I work in London and have never had an issue. I would just recommend (like any big European city) to keep your belongings in a zipped bag, make sure you can see them, and don't walk around with your phone out too much. In terms of pickpockets it's similar to Barcelona for example. \n\nFrom Heathrow you can get the Elizabeth line to farringdon and then a direct train to Brighton, it's a really easy journey and the trains are both nice and spacious for any luggage you have.",

It definitely doesn't mean feeling great all the time, so it's good that you're giving yourself space to process some of these more negative feelings rather than trying to force yourself to feel happy, which can just make things worse. And writing it all out can really help too. Maybe calling a loved one who you feel you can vent to and confide in might also help. Ironically after venting like that it can often help turn the tide and lead to feeling more relaxed and happy during a trip, maybe partly because venting (either in writing or with a loved one) can help take the pressure off yourself to feel \"good\" for the whole trip.",

For example, there are 2 national holidays in september and if you go during this time then you will find an incredibly difficult time finding a place to stay (Japanese people usually book domestic trips months in advance, like 5-6 months). I wouldn't recommend business hotels because rooms usually smell like cigarette smoke, even if you're on a floor that doesn't have smoking rooms. But, if you decide not to book in advance, love hotels are actually a good option for last-minute accommodation. There are quite a few sketchy/skeevy ones, but many are quite nice, usually have vacancies, and have their own bathrooms. Plus it makes for a good story",

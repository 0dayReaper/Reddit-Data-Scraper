    "postText": "I\u2019m traveling abroad for the first time without my family and so I booked a bunch of hostels to stay in throughout southern Europe. After booking I had a little accident which required a wound to be cauterized (nothing serious though) and the antibiotic burn cream I\u2019m prescribed should be kept refrigerated. I\u2019ve never stayed in a hostel before so I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019ll be able to refrigerate it, does anyone know if this would be possible/is allowed?\n\nNote: I don\u2019t think it HAS to be refrigerated but my Dr recommended I refrigerate it, I can/will ask her for clarification after the weekend.",

            "comment": "Yes and no. Many hostels have common fridges to allow guests to store food and such in the kitchen, in bags labelled with your name or room/bunk number. Ask to see if the hostels you've booked have this, because not all of them do. Generally, if there's a common kitchen and cooking facilities for guests, there's probably a refrigerator. If the medication is very expensive / essential for your health, petty theft from common fridges does happen, so you may want to ask the hostel staff to store it in their private locked fridge instead, if there is one.\n\nAnother option is to get an insulated pouch to keep your medication cool, similar to how people with diabetes travel with insulin.",

Figured I\u2019d save some time and money and ask others who have better general knowledge and experience. You know, using Reddit for its intended purpose. You should try it sometime, it might make you a bit smarter and kinder :)",

    "postText": "I am a 21 y/o male traveling to France for 2 months from June to July. I have traveled *once* before through school for about 2 weeks, but I've never done anything even close to as independent as this trip will be. For over a year, I've been doing tons of research on everything from packing to tips and how to plan, etc. I felt confident that I was completely prepared, but as the date of my departure draws nearer, I'm getting a bit anxious, and I want to make sure all of my bases are covered.\n\nSo far, I've bought my plane tickets and my travel insurance. I pretty much know everything that I'm gonna pack (I'm doing carry-on only btw). There are still a few things I need to buy like an e-sim plan and a few packing items, but I'm comfortable and confident with everything I'm bringing. I plan on booking hostels for my first 2\u20135 days which will be in or around Paris. From there, I'll figure out where I'll stay and what I'll do as I go along. Honestly, I really don't have a plan for what to do. Of course, I'd love to visit the Louvre and Madame Tussaud's, but I don't have any specific places to be or things to do. I'm much more interested in being immersed in the culture vs seeing a monument like the Eiffel Tower, for example.\n\nI'm extremely frugal, so I plan to couchsurf, if possible, for a lot of the trip, and stay in Hostels otherwise. I also plan to stay exclusively in France. I've never heard of someone only backpacking in a single country in Europe, especially for such a long period of time. I feel like there's so much to explore in France alone, but because of the freedom of this trip, I could go/do whatever I want if I change my mind. Am I making a mistake by \"planning\" to only stay in France? Regarding transportation, I'd like to walk 99% of the time and only take trains a few times, but I have no idea how realistic this is. This is mostly to save on transportation costs but also because I think I'll find interest in any city I stumble upon, and I'm not particularly interested in visiting any specific cities. Can I walk, or should I plan to take more public transportation?\n\nLastly, I'm unsure about bringing my laptop. It's a Macbook air, so it's extremely thin and light and has a very long battery life (which can also act as a power bank, if I need it for that). I've heard a lot of people say not to bring your laptop, but I'm a huge laptop user. I hardly use my mobile phone in my everyday life and instead use my laptop for almost everything. Not to mention that pretty much all of my hobbies require my laptop, and it's much easier and more convenient to do research and book hostels this way. I'm very reluctant not to bring it\n\n**Some extra info about me:**  \nI chose France because I've always wanted to come here. I've been studying French language and culture for the past 6 years. I also feel more comfortable being there because I'm near-fluent in French and it's right next to the UK if I feel like going somewhere that speaks English. \n\nI mentioned that I am extremely frugal, but I am not broke, by any means. I have *plenty* of money for emergencies or in case I want to change any plans or travel anywhere different. I'd rather not spend my entire life savings on this trip, but it's there for me to use if I choose to do so. \n\nPerhaps it's foolish for me to decide to go carry-on only as a first-timer, but I'm a pretty hardcore minimalist, and living exclusively from my backpack is one of the most exciting aspects of this trip for me. Although I've read a lot about bringing a \"day bag\" and leaving luggage at the hostel, I'd rather have everything I need on my back at all times, and I know that I can do it and do it lightly. Plus, as I mentioned, I'd like to walk the majority of my trip. \n\nNobody in my family has ever traveled before, and backpacking is a completely foreign concept to all of us which makes it even scarier for me. My parents are reluctantly supportive, but they think that what I'm doing is insane, and they don't exactly approve of it. All of this is to say that I'm really stepping out of my comfort zone here, and I'm pretty much completely on my own since my family has no experience with this. I'm extremely excited and nervous. Thank you all in advance for helping me!",

No need to overthink it, and with Europe public transport is pretty much always there as a viable option.\n\nTake your laptop. If you frequently use it at home, then you'll do the same while travelling and appreciate having it. By the same token, don't take shit that you don't already use in your everyday life.",

Things you don't plan can't go wrong and you won't be disappointed. \n\nOn future trips I will also plan much less to really get to know a place, instead of ticking off boxes. You will realize you can literally do whatever you like. You can hop over to Germany or Spain if you're in the corner and feel like it. Or don't,  noone can or will stop you. \n\nAnd carry on is awesome. I am so glad I travel light everytime I see others with two backpacks and sooo much stuff.",

They often will also have paper maps, grab one.\n\nChat to other people and be open and chill.   Don't get too drunk anywhere.\n\nConsider separating money out into different places as well as some with your passport and keep that very secure, other with a belt holder (tucked inside your trousers) or something similar,you should never open this in public unless really necessary.  Beware of pickpockets.\n\nRemember taxis are useful.\n\nTake the earlier bus or train than the one you need to important paces (like the airport).\n\nDo as the locals do.  Quiet is better than loud in public.\n\nAsk questions if you need to.\n\nEnjoying y yourself and have fun.",

            "comment": "Most of my posts here are warning people to trim down their European itinerary to just one or two countries or a small region, so doing France in two months is totally fine!!!  If you don't have hotel commitments and you do get sick of France, Amsterdam is just 3.5 hrs by highspeed train with Brussels along the way and Bruges is a nice side trip.  London is not far either by train.  \n\nBicycle tours in Paris and Amsterdam are fun too.  I took a tour in each to help understand the rules of the road then rented bikes later on on my own.  \n\nFor the major tourist attractions, get tickets in advance online to avoid lines.\n\nRick Steves has a free app with audio walking tours that are really good.  Otherwise you just walk past things not know what you're missing.\n\nTake your laptop if you want.  I brought mine to Thailand for 3 weeks and used it everyday.  The longer you go, the more you'll use it.  Just watching netflix and shows occasionally was worth it.  When you travel for extended periods, have that normalcy in your life keeps you from getting burnt out.\n\nJust try not to bring too much overall.  Like you can always buy a shirt here or there or whatnot.  \n\nRegarding walking, I walk a lot too but what I'll often do it take the train first thing to my destination, like a museum/city center/landmark and then walk around then walk back to the hostel.  That way I save some of my legs and don't waste too much time repeating the same walk.  I also like to get to attractions early to check that box then I can just hang out the remainder of the day.",

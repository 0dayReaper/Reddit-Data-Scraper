    "postText": "Hello, \n\ni will have an internship in valencia, spain, from mid june to mid july. Every week i decided to take the train and see what spain has to offer. \n\nOn one of these weekends id love to see galicia. Id have to take the trains from valencia. I really want to see the atlantic ocean at least once in life. I planned to find a single airbnb and from there id take the bus or go to foot to the beach or go diving/ scuba diving. I don't care much about the city, im only there for the ocean. \n\nDo you have reccomendation for zones where i should stay at?\n\nId prefer the cities/ towns that are most west (f.e. Vigo, Oia). Zones that have beautiful scenery are preferred, also it would be great if there was some scuba place near it where i could purchase scuba experience for a day. \n\nThanks for reading and i appreciate every comment/ recommendation.",

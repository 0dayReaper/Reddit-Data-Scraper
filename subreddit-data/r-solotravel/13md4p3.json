    "postText": "So I M25 am on a WHV in Canada. At the moment I am volunteering at a hostel while applying for a permanent role elsewhere in Canada. I do have a lot in savings, however, I am weary of blowing my money as I would also like to keep my savings long term. \n\nAt the moment to try and save on money I am: \n\na) walking where possible \n\nb) shopping at a supermarket and trying to do as much cooking as possible \n\nc) if possible, using city bikes as opposed to the metro \n\nd) I get free accommodation through volunteering at the hostel \n\nI find it socially difficult - as I want to meet people and build and maintain friendships, I do go out to eat. However, what is the best way to stick to my budget?  If anyone has been in a similar position in volunteering, please let me know.",

            "comment": "As a Canadian myself, it's honestly tough to save money in Canada because of the economy and inflation and the fact that Canada has never really been known as a cheap country to travel to. I would say in order to save money that the best option is what you're doing right now and getting a permanent role that will pay you. I'm not sure where in Canada you currently are but maybe look into getting a summer job at a hotel or ski resort as that is where many other young people work so you could still be social.",

            "comment": "I do not have any WHV experience, but as someone who has traveled long term and teaches personal finance, a few tips:\n\n1. Step one is always know where your money is going. Budgets can feel restricting, but they can also be empowering if you know you have enough money to spend because you are familiar with your own finances. If you are not already tracking in some way, I recommend either a spread sheet, making a pie chart, or using an app like Mint or Tripcoin (a personal favorite).\n2. Once you figure out where you are actually spending money, you can start moving it around different categories. Maybe you are spending more than you realize or maybe you knew exactly what you had, but it is always helpful to start differentiating expenses by categories so you can make changes.\n3. There are lots of fun things you can do with friends that do not involve spending as much as a meal at a restaurant. Get coffee and go for a walk, host a game night in the lounge, win at trivia so drinks are free, buy prepared food from a grocery store and have a picnic. \n\nEvery person and every budget is different so I do not have super specific advice to give you. Number one though is know your cash flow and your categories.\n\nHope this helps :)",

            "comment": "&gt;At the moment I am volunteering at a hostel\n\nVolunteering?  You are getting \"free accommodation\" and being used as cheap labour.  Canada has labour laws that you should be aware of.  You are either being underpaid or taking a job from someone who should have one. \n\nYou don't say where you are and what sort of job you are looking for, so it is difficult to help.   \nGo and get a casual job at a restaurant, bar or cafe. Pinning your hopes on finding a permanent role soon and trying to stick to a strict budget can end up being a bit of a disaster, with no job and your savings being depleted.",

If you're having a hard time saving then having concrete numbers could help you ground yourself and/or set reasonable expectations.",

Very easy to get loose and then make a terrible budgetary decision like buying a round of shots. If it\u2019s actual cash you have to hand over, knowing that you won\u2019t have anymore, it\u2019s easier to avoid blowing money you can\u2019t afford. In fact, avoiding bars entirely really helps extending your cash supply.",

Some cities in Canada are mind-blowing my expensive, and getting more expensive at a rapid pace, and are not worth the price of admission. If you have any French ability at all, I\u2019d suggest Montr\u00e9al over other major Canadian cities. It\u2019s the right balance of vibrant and semi-affordable.\n\nSmaller cities might be an option, but the problem with smaller cities is that municipal and inter-city transit in Canada is often garbage outside of specific areas (the GTA-to-Montr\u00e9al corridor, lower mainland British Columbia), and so car expenses become a consideration.\n\nAs a Canadian, you picked a tough time to try to put down roots here. My only advice is to buy the cheapest consumer goods you can find and to cling to any reasonably affordable accommodation as though your life depended on it.",

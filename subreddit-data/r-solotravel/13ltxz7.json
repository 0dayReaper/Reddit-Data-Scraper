    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm planning to visit mainland Greece and Bulgaria in early 2024. I'll be 29 yrs old by then. Ideally, I'd start in Athens and make my way up to Sofia, visiting Meteora, Thessaloniki and maybe Delphi. In Bulgaria, I'd like to stick to cities like Sofia, Plovdiv and Varna. \n\nHowever, I have a few questions for those who've been there:\n\n1. Can I do the Meteora hike over a few days? I have reasonable fitness (could improve) but short legs. I've looked at a map of Kalambaka and thought about visiting the monasteries over 2-3 days. \n\n2. What cities should I add to my list? It's not the season for islands, I know. But I should have 3-4 weeks in these two countries. \n\n3. What is the quality of the intercity trains in Bulgaria and Greece like?\n\nAny comments on Greece &amp; Bulgaria or my proposed ideas are welcome.\n\nI have done solo trips to the United Kingdom and in major Australian cities. I've done three previous trips (with others) in European winters. Recently, I went to Turkey and loved it. Typically, I stay in 3-4 star hotels and am interested in religion, culture, history, art, literature, etc. \n\nEnjoy your weekend!",

Sofia also has some ruins in the middle of the city.\n\nI traveled by train from Athens to Meteora to Thesaloniki and was fine, it was like 5/6 hours to Meteora and about the same to Thesaloniki\n\nIn Bulgaria I did Bansko to Plovdiv to Sofia by train. The first part of the Bansko to Plovdiv trip is beautiful, its an oldish train that goes through the mountains, pretty cool. I think the trip is about 6 hours. Plovdiv to Sofia was quite fast, just 3 or 4 of hours at most.\n\nVisit Bansko in Bulgaria, pretty little town in the mountains. \n\nIn Meteora I visited like 5 monasteries in 2 days, they are small and at walkable distance one from the other.",

(If you\u2019re happy to take taxis and stuff then this is irrelevant), but yea the most convenient way down is a hike from the second last monastery.",

You'd save the money on hotels and tours and save a few days for other things. If you wanna catch a sunset you can leave Athens in the morning, get there by 2, check everything out, catch the sunset, get a room or bed and get back the next day. Stay an extra night if it's within your budget or want more from it.",

Delphi is also quite a detour, haven't been there in years but I remember the road being kinda bad and there's not much yo see in winter. Also February won't be an optimal time period for any of these travels, please reconsider for autumn or sping. Message me for anything you want to ask ofc",

Trains started running again but they take like almost double the time since their speed is now low to avoid future accidents. However even if they reach their previous speed I wouldn't trust one, especially on the line Athens- Thessaloniki since they have taken no safety measures still. For example everything on these lines is done manually and no telecom is used which is required",

We are country bumpkins and generally avoid cities but I think it is time for me to grow up a bit.\n\u2022I know if the ittiest-bittiest amount of French. If you gave me a list of samples from 10 different languages spoken in Europe, I probably couldn\u2019t correctly identify Dutch. \n\nHostels I will be staying at if I go to both locations (unless anyone had better recommendations):\nParis: The People Paris Bercy\nAmsterdam: ClinkNOORD\n\nI need a good sized locker wherever I go, after the 4-5 days, I am going to Switzerland for 2 weeks to do hard outdoor work. I just wanted to have a little fun before that and get used to the time change. \n\nAlso if anyone has any packing tips or tips for taking the train as a foreigner who has rode on a train for once in her life, I will forever appreciate you. \n\nThank you in advance for any advice you have for me!! &lt;3",

I'd suggest Paris as it's larger and more diverse, but you can easily spend four very enjoyable days in Amsterdam.\n\nEveryone in the Netherlands speaks good English (it's actually considered offensive to ask Dutch people if they speak English), and most people you'll encounter as a tourist in Paris will as well.\n\n[https://www.seat61.com/](https://www.seat61.com/) is an excellent resource for trains.

North to south.\n\nI will have spent 4.5 weeks in Vietnam with family and will continue to explore Vietnam solo after my family leaves and stay in hostels. I have done a lot with my family but there are things I have not done yet. How does my itinerary look starting the end of June?\n\nFor my solo trip, I have 5 weeks but I was thinking of cutting it down to 4 weeks. Should I keep it at 5 weeks or cut it down to 4 weeks? I plan to travel by train over bus when it is available and fly if the train or bus travel time is over 12 hours.\n\nI have done Halong Bay was thinking of skipping it unless I missed something that interest me. I did Na Trang and did not like it so I will skip it. I plan on skipping Mui Ne since it is another beach town south of Na Trang. Is Phu Quoc worth the visit especially in July?\n\nNorth Section\n- Hanoi (Fly in from HCMC. Center location for north section)\n    - Did Train Street\n- Halong Bay (Skip? Bus from and to Hanoi)\n    - Did 2 days and 1 night boat cruise\n    - Did Kayak, Bon Hon Island and Sung Sot/Suprise Cave\n- Sapa (Train from Hanoi)\n- Ha Giang Loop (Bus from Sapa and to Hanoi)\n- Ninh Binh and Tam Coc (Bus from Hanoi and train to Phong Nha)\n\nMiddle Section\n- Phong Nha (Train from Ninh Binh and Tam Coc)\n- Hue (Bus from Phong Na)\n- Hoi An (Train from Hue and bus to Da Nang)\n- Da Nang (Bus from Hue and fly to Dalat)\n- Nha Trang (Skip?)\n    - Did 2 days 1 night\n    - Did not like the beach\n- Dalat (Fly from Da Nang)\n- Mui Ne (Skip?)\n    - Another beach town south of Nha Trang.\n\nSouth Section\n- Ho Chi Minh City (Bus from Dalat)\n    - Did American War Museum\n- Phu Quoc Island (Flight from and to HCMC)",

Would it be better to just be in one long flight?\n\nI've only taken a 9-hour flight red eye flight before and it was on a budget carrier (cheaper than economy, no perks), and I didn't like it one bit (no one does). However, not sure if being in economy would make the experience more tolerable.",

But if there is a 12h difference it might take you a few days to adjust both ways making it more difficult to really enjoy your trip. Try to pick places where there is little to no time difference. For example, US to South America which have similar time zones.\n\nSecond, layover. Short layover can be good to stretch and grab a bite between flights. Long layover are more tricky because you\u2019re basically wasting time unless you\u2019re able to get out of the airport and visit for a bit. If you can, pick overnight flight with short layover. This way you can sleep in the plane, stretch out between flights, and start exploring right away when you get to your destination in the morning.\n\nUnfortunately this is not always possible. If you really want to go somewhere with a 24h+ flight, try to go for longer. This way you don\u2019t waste 2-3 days just to get there and back.",

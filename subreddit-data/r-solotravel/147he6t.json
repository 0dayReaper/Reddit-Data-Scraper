    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI\u2019m doing this post in the hope of gathering some useful informations that could help me in my journey.\n\nI\u2019ve been traveling for 3 month through South East Asia already and I just gave myself a new challenge for the next couple months. I know it won\u2019t be easy but still !\n\nI\u2019m currently in Bangkok and decided to go all the way down south in hope to find a boat on the way that can carry me to Sri Lanka or even India. I am ready to go down to Singapore if i need to. \n\nI made some research already and I know that there is no company that propose the transportation of passengers on this region. So I have 2 possibilities if I want to cross the sea : find a cargo ship or private sailing boat that let me jump in. \n\nI\u2019m obviously ready to pay for the transportation, I am also ready to work on the boat if needed. \n\nI\u2019ve never travelled or met anyone that travelled like this so if anyone here have any advises, tips or experiences to share to help me in my research it would be much appreciated \n\nThanks and safe travel to all \u270c\ud83c\udffb",

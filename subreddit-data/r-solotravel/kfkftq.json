    "postText": "I don't necessarily mean it in a sinister way. Just like... the most odd/BIZARRE (not OLD \ud83d\ude43). \n\nI was in one of the Budapest Party hostels about 5 years ago and one of the other solo travellers there was obsessed with chess. Would only talk about chess. Commandeered the hostel chess set and went from group to group trying to play it with every guest. Absolutely dominated all of them. After the win, he would move on without saying much. \n\nOn my last day there, I was his lucky chosen one. We started playing. I'm shit at chess. He took my queen after 5 or so moves. \n\nAt this point one of the staff announces that anyone coming on the hostel organised day trip has 10 minutes to meet at the reception before they head off. Mr Chess must have reserved a place on this trip because he was getting noticeably nervous and prompting me to hurry up everytime it was my turn. I was getting destroyed so I of course purposefully slowed down. \n\nThe ten minutes passed and he had to leave. Our match was far from over and he was freaking out. He insisted that we took a picture of the board and continued where we left off when he returned. He then quickly shovelled all the chess pieces into the box and brought the chess set with him on the day trip. \n\nAfter they left, I packed my stuff and moved on to Croatia. \n\nI often think about him and wonder if I was the only person he didn't beat on his trip. \n\nWhat were your most odd encounters?",

            "comment": "Met a Japanese guy while in Indonesia who claimed to be an illegitimate heir to the imperial throne. Most people were playing along, thinking it was a joke at first, but when one person questioned it he became dead serious and started pulling out **copies** (yes, plural) of his birth certificate, which of course most of us couldn't read since it was in Japanese. The dude pretty much wouldn't shut up until the dude who questioned him just gave in and said he believed the story.\n\nTwo days later that guy had checked out, and one of the people in the hostel revealed he could, in fact, read Japanese and that while it by all accounts looked like a real birth certificate, there was nothing on there which proves he was descended from Hirohito like he claimed. So this dude is just traveling around with copies of his, presumably, real birth certificate.",

Not a Hirohito descendant claim but something more realistic or grounded  like descending from a minor royal bloodline  of some forgotten kingdom or being related to a popular celebrity in some different nation . I kind of want to do this  but I don't have the required skill set  for this and my anxiety crushes me when I lie  but maybe someone else can?",

            "comment": "In the middle of the cradle mountain, (which is a wilderness hiking area in Tasmania, Australia) years ago, we met a chap who was doing the overland trail (its about a week of pretty hard hiking). It had been pretty inclement weather was varying between fog, snow and rain.  We all had goretex and full on protection from the elements.  James, the guy we met.. was wearing a wetsuit.\n\nWhen I say wetsuit, I mean one of those kind of water skiing ones with a zip up the front and bare legs and arms. It was green and red and he looked extremely peculiar, a bit like a frog with lilly white legs.    He introduced by saying 'This is embarrassing to admit, but I'm a trifle lost'. He had a super posh english accent, like a BBC radio announcer. We offered to show him the way to the next  hut.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was wearing a wetsuit because he had no rain gear and for some reason thought a cheap second hadn't wetsuit would be a good idea to toughen himself up (more on this later). The chafing after several days was unbelievable, and lets just say he had a kind distinctive of rubbery pong. When he wasn't wearing the wetsuit he was wearing a light business shirt (somewhat grubby) and shorts.\n\nThat night We got to know him and he ended up hiking the rest of the trip with us (probably saving the park rangers a lot of trouble as he was hopeless at direction finding).  We asked him why he was undertaking this trip in such an arduous way and it spurred a line we will never forget.\n\nHe said 'You see, Daddy was a Ghurka'.\n\nIt turns out he was from a long familial line of British officers who used to lead the brave bands of tough nepalese in the army. He was anxious to follow in this line and had unfortunately not succeeded in passing the physical test to get in. From what I understand this was a field exercise where he had to lead actual ghurkas who are extremely fit and tough. He had been found wanting, so had decided to toughen himself up and try the entrance exams again the next year. Hence here he was in the middle of nowhere, toughening.\n\nHe was a hell of a nice guy and had fascinating tales to tell. He'd been through nepal with his father delivering pensions to the retired ghurkas prior to coming on the hike. He was completely dedicated to 'getting tough'. The food he had provided himself was absolutely minimal (some porridge and a lump of cheese) and we ended up feeding him as he'd sit there at meal times looking like a starving puppy and insisting he wasn't hungry . When we got back to civilisation, he distinguished himself by eating three main courses and desert in a sitting. He must have been famished, but he claimed this was a strategy to stuff himself when in civilisation and then starve his way through his ordeals to 'toughen up'..\n\nI sincerely hope he made it into the Ghurkas. He gave us a lot of laughs and whenever the people I did the hike with catch up, someone will utter the immortal line ' You see ... Daddy was a Ghurka'",

They fit in well with the other hostelers and were just all around lovely people.  As I continued to travel, I kept running into them in random locations throughout Eastern Europe.

When I went to the room, I turned on the light and got startled. Some guy was already sleeping there. It was a shared room, but I didn't expect anyone to be sleeping since it was the middle of the day.\n\nHe woke up from light and the noise of me walking in and putting my bag down. He seemed annoyed that I had woken him up.\n\nI was a teenager at the time, and he was much older. Maybe 40? I made an awkward attempt at starting conversation. \"So, what brings you to Liverpool...\"\n\nHe got up, walked over to the window, pointed outside, and said in heavily accented English, \"my car\"",

            "comment": "I stayed in this real shit hostel in the south of france. The room was literally a converted shed attached to the side of a house. The only other person staying at the hostel was this 60yr old man who looked like he had never spent a day indoors. At first I thought it was going to be super weird, it was only the 3rd hostel I had stayed in and heard horror stories of bunking with older guests. The first night I barely made eye contact with him. The second day I got back from exploring and found him sitting in the garden and he asked me if I'd like to join him for a glass of wine, I was still a little creeped out but I had been on my own all day and was in need of some conversation. \n\nThis guy was one of the nicest, coolest most down to earth people I had the pleasure of meeting on my trip. He was a 60yr  Australian man who was cycling around continental Europe. He was a divorced with no family and decided this was how he wanted to spend his free time. I can't remember what he did for a living but essentially he would work for a month at a time, then get a month off and would come and do a leg of the journey, fly home, each time returning to pick up from where he left off. \n\nWe spent the next two nights sitting in the garden, drinking and sharing stories, his stories were way cooler than mine. He explained that he was not a wealthy man and growing up all he had wanted to be was an explorer, how he had lost all of his family and how he decided that at 50 something he was going to live out his dream. He couldn't afford to drive it all, or to stay in fancy hotels or even hostels most of the time. So he decided to cycle it, he had spent most nights either camping, staying in homeless shelters or just finding a park bench to curl up on. He had been doing this for the past 5 years, every vacation just slowly chipping away at it. \n \n\nI'm so thankful he invited me for that glass of wine. He went from being the creepy old guy to one of the fondest people I met on my travels. It just goes to show you should never judge a book by its cover, everyone has a story and if you just take a minute to listen you might be pleasantly surprised. \n\nI always wonder about him and how his journey is going, if he's still out there cycling away or if he finally completed his exploration.",

I was in Sorrento, Italy by myself in a hostel and I had a double female room, so one roommate, a girl from Korea. She did not speak one word of English, and back then all we had to communicate was a map and basically nothing else. I pointed to the map and asked where she was from, and she pointed to North Korea, not South Korea. I pointed to South Korea and gave her a look like, \"are you sure?\" and she nodded and shrugged. I'm still not sure what all that was about.\n\nAnyway, over a couple days we became fast friends before I went on my way. We ate our meals together, went out and drank and got hit on by guys we couldn't understand, went on long walks, etc. It was so nice. We literally NEVER exchanged words either of us understood, we just pointed at shit and laughed at oddities, art we saw on the sidewalk, and basically communicated via exaggerated facial expressions. \n\nIt was one of the more unique experiences of my life, and although I have no idea where she is now or even what her name was, I wish her well.",

I always tried to leave the groups she entered but I kept running into her the entire weekend I was there. \n\nHer most memorable physical traits were: the \u2018not all who wander are lost\u2019 tattoo on her lower neck/upper back with an obviously crooked horizon line that she got in Thailand and said was \u2018on purpose\u2019 (yeah, no way that was a drunken mistake on Khoa San Road...), the \u2018tiger claw\u2019 scar she gave herself by heating up a butter knife and branding her own shoulder (seriously.), and her dragonfly tattoo on her bicep that was her absolute favorite thing. \n\nThe hostel organized a tour and we were paired off into groups... of course I got this girl in mine. We were all swimming in this lake &amp; a dragon fly landed right next to her tattoo. Cue rant about how \u2018this dragonfly chose me\u2019 &amp; \u2018this is my spirit animal\u2019 while shouting to the heavens that she is some dragonfly in human form... then it bites her and flies away. The dragonfly was on her for less than a minute &amp; even it had enough of her shit. \n\nWow, honestly didn\u2019t realize this girl had been living in my mind rent free this long... thanks for reading.",

Like any responsible adult, he accepted drugs from this stranger. He told us that it was only his second time ever tripping in his life. Essentially on this day he had taken 2 tabs in a foreign country, left his phone and wallet at the hostel and had been walking around the island all day.\n\nHe came to this Indian Restaurant to try to grab a drink, calm down and try to find balance.\n\nI ended up inviting him to sit with my dad and I because he seemed like he could really use a friend. He was in Panama on business and came to Bocas for some party time before heading back to Australia. He had definitely gotten himself into more than he anticipated and really appreciated the human connection. \n\nAs to be expected he shared many off the wall ramblings, and had moments of deep passion and where his eyes lit up with understanding. It was clear this was a transformational experience for him, and definitely the weirdest dinner I have ever shared with my father.\n\nAfter we finished eating, he told me he wanted to go dancing. We went to club Summer and proceeded to have one of the craziest nights out Ive ever had.",

A new guy showed up and there was space in the minivan, so I invited him along.\n\nA minute or two into the five minute drive, the guy starts yelling to stop the car. I think he's having some type of medical emergency, but he quickly explains he has a drum circle (or similar) to attend and runs out the car. Weird.\n\nThe rest of us arrive and start eating tacos. Sure enough, drum circle guy shows up acting normal and says he had the time wrong.",

            "comment": "I met another American guy at a hostel in Vietnam, he was in his mid 30's and I think he was struggling with some mental health issues. He was the walking embodiment of negative American stereotypes rolled into one. He did such a good job of checking the boxes of bad behavior I was almost convinced it was some intentional comical genius or something... I was at the hostel for two days, and in those two days he must have told this \"joke\" where he just screamed as loud as possible \"and then they get you, and then they take you!!\" or something like that. The louder he did it the more uncomfortable people would get and laugh along out of confusion. He also would go up to groups of people at the hostel and start yelling \"Speak English the is America!\". He was constantly drunk, but there was definitely a screw loose on top of that, the guy was struggling.\n\nI spent most of my time convincing people at the hostel not all Americans shared his crazy sentiments. I'm not sure why I felt a responsibility to do damage control in the situation, but he was really rubbing people the wrong way and whenever he started talking to another group and yelling nonsense,  I would go up and tell him someone at the pool wanted to talk to him or something, and he would walk off and come back 10 minutes later with no memory of my misdirection.\n\nOh yea, and at one point I was walking back to the hostel from the beach and saw him tear out of the driveway on a scooter with a young french(?) girl on the back of it.. I was kind of concerned and asked someone there what had happened. I guess she had just shown up and he caught her off guard and pressured her to go into the old town with him. About twenty minutes after they left she comes limping back into the hostel and has a cut up hand. I guess this guy had crashed the scooter, and drove off without her and just yelled \"sorry\" back to her as he left. He came back a few hours later to everyone, staff included, yelling at him. He just acted like nothing happened. I left the next day. No idea what happened to that guy, but on some level I felt bad for him, and as time goes on the ridiculousness of that situation makes me laugh more and more.",

            "comment": "I worked at a hostel for a while in Temple Bar Dublin, for a while. Really busy place, mostly great folks! Met so many interesting people, and really only one not so great experience - the time I met a real life.... mastermind thief?  \n\n\nStory time!   \n\n\nA group of folks checked in from the tour company we would sometimes serve, won't bother naming them but man - they were ridiculous, basically just a big drinking bus that usually did like, Dublin, Cork, Galway, back to Dublin. \"The real Irish Experience\" - drinking in a bus with a load of strangers all day, staying in a couple of hostels... hey, maybe they are right. \n\nAnyways, check in goes smoothly, we get the 20 of them their room keys, even sold them all the pub crawl for the night, heck yes commission! Off to their rooms they go, many of them in the big 12 person dorms. In the back of the line is a young Scottish girl - not part of the tour. Felt awful she had to wait behind the group, so worked it out we could upgrade her! She didn't need to stay in the 12 person room, we could put her in the 6! \n\n\"No no, I like the bigger rooms, great for meeting people, and can I also get a ticket for the pub crawl? That group looked like fun!\" Sure thing, more commission for me, and a quieter evening shift as they'd all be gone by like, 9pm. \n\nSo, scan the passport, get the room key, give her the pub crawl wrist band, and away she goes to the 12 person dorm, as she requested. \n\nA few hours later, I watch as the majority of the hostel empties out to go enjoy the crawl. I settle in for a quiet late shift, thinking about what I might do for dinner later. 20 min later, the Scottish girl is back, saying she's feeling a bit ill, and just wants to go lay down. I say I'm sorry she's not in the mood, she can keep the bracelet and go tomorrow, up she goes. \n\nMy shift ends, night shift comes on. \"No trouble, easy crowd, loads at the pub crawl, probably messy at 3am! good luck!\" I say as I head out the door...\n\nI start the next morning, 7am. One of the women from the tour comes tearing down the stairs, sobbing. \"It's gone, it's all gone! They took it all!\" This Australian woman is in a tizzy. \n\nLong story short - the Scottish girl was a MAJOR scammer, going around Scotland, England, Ireland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and had even hit Germany. The gaurds said it was an international hunt - she used fake ID's everywhere she went! It was a FAKE passport, she wasn't Scottish, just brilliant at accents. She listened, heard who was going on the pub crawl, befriended them, went with them, then came back, snuck into the room, checked all the underbed lockers to see which was unlocked, and took...wait for it...  $8000 AUD and some sterling to boot. The Australian woman on the tour had brought a ton of money and thought by being \"secretive\" about it, no one would take it. Please, no rude comments about this woman. She learned her lesson. But this scammer with the fake passports was not fooled - she even figured out how to pull the beds away from the wall and get to the lockers (really just cages) from the back, where even if there were locks, she could bypass that. \n\nNight crew said she left around 1am, before anyone came home from the Pub Crawl, simply dropped off her key and said she wouldn't be back. \n\nI don't know if they ever found her - they did allow the woman to remain on the tour and to come back for her return night in dublin, no charge, as....she'd lost a lot of money....but holy cow. It was the wildest experience I've ever had! Worse, I sort of forgot what the Australian woman looked like, so a week later when the tour group checked back in, I smiled brightly and said \"Did you have the best time in Ireland? People here are really great, aren't they?\" - the glare off of her was...strong. Immediately remembered who she was, gave her a room key and a complimentary lock for her underbed locker, and hoped I wouldn't see her again.",

I was quite taken aback and didn't want to start a political debate over pancakes, but she wouldn't drop it.  That was only the beginning. \n\nThe hostel was a home base for me and I stayed there off and on for several months. The lady was always there. We struck up a friendship of sorts. I think she had paranoid schizophrenia and I felt really bad for her.  She opened up to me about being estranged from her son, about how the Canadian school board was after her and her doctor in Costa Rica might be involved, and how she had written a computer program that would end world hunger but people keep stealing it because she can't find if on her computer. \n\nOne night I was chatting with another long term guest. He was also high maintenance and lonely, and butted heads with the lady. He was telling me all his problems back home when the lady came up us and interrupted him to tell me how her problems were going. They got into a huge yelling match and the hostel workers had to come and tell them to go to separate areas.",

First of all all her belongings were in these massive pink bags with hearts that I thought had cutesy messages scribbled on them, but on closer look revealed to be things like \"Dykes will perish\" and \"kill all lesbians\". \n\nShe came in when everyone was already in bed (around 11pm) and started to go through her bag for a good thirty minutes. Then she ran the water tap in the room for few seconds, left the room, came back, ran the tap, walked the 5m space between her bags and the sink over and over again, always popping in and out of the room for just few seconds at a time. After this had been going on for like two hours and I was lying in the bed super freaked out, someone switched the lights on as no one was able to sleep. She came back and switched the lights off, continued pacing in the room and going through her bag. When she left again the lights were switched back on. She again tried to switch the lights off before entering, was told not to. She said she doesn't want to wake anyone up, we all said we're awake. But then came the really strange part: she would refuse to enter the room with the lights on and everyone else in the room being freaked out insisted that we keep the lights on. She kept saying she just needs something from her bag but can only get it in the dark.\n\nSomeone went to get the hostel staff and the strange lady was asked to move to a different dorm. She agreed but wanted her bags... but again they could only be retrieved in darkness. After a lot of arguing she agreed to pick them up and go. It was 2am and we could finally switch off the lights, but I don't think anyone was able to sleep after that, thinking what the hell had even been in those bags!",

I was a bit perplexed. A couple minutes later, he came back in and had a whole chicken and just dropped it in the searing pot. It smelled SO bad. He left the room again, and while enduring the awful burnt meat smell, I went over to look in the pot and all that was in there was a whole putrid chicken (I say putrid bc it looked anything but fresh) and a whole pomegranate lol this guy was quite the chef lol He also drank my beer in the fridge but I\u2019m sure that happens to a lot of hostel-goers. \n\nThere were also a couple of other fun characters there, a guy that claimed he was a narcotics officer (didn\u2019t seem to be true lol) and this other guy who offered me some unappealing chocolate in the hallway. After, he said I was like Britney Spears and I did a little dance and sang for him lol every time we saw him then he would give a little wave and yell \u201cAntony!\u201d To my friend Andrew haha fun stuff",

Anyways, after a night of clubbing, I climbed up into my top bunk, and tried to get some sleep around 2am. Of course that was still early for most people, so there was a string of loud drunken people coming and going for the next few hours. Then this group of 4 comes in, takes there bottom bunks, and proceeds to talk loudly in the dark about how much they wanted to pull that night. They quiet down eventually, but I swear I could hear some sucking and moaning noises. The beds all had curtains, so I couldn't really tell what was going on, but then the beds began to creak and rock. Then it eventually stopped, and I was left wondering what the hell did I just listen too. Then this group of 4 proceeds to talk aloud about what a great orgy that was, and that they should all try this again sometime, preferably in a \"proper hotel room with some privacy\". Like wtf? Even in a party hostel in a drunken haze, who has an orgy in a room filled with like 14 other random people?",

I took a couple of slices of pancakes and went to leave when a man in his late forties wearing a red T-shirt started shouting at me in front of everyone saying one piece only and how he makes everyone pancakes every morning and now there\u2019s not enough for everyone (bare in mind each pancake was cut up into like 4 pieces so I literally had half a pancake on my plate) I assumed he worked there as all the staff wear red, I found out from some other travellers over breakfast that he didn\u2019t work there, safe to say I didn\u2019t finish my breakfast.\n\n\n\nHe would host these \u2018dinner parties\u2019 where he would offer to cook for the whole hostel and lay a bath towel on the tables and bring out a giant pot of pasta or soup nice right? Well he had control issues and would control how much people eat for example he would have a big bowl of m&amp;ms and offer them to you and let you take 1. \n\n\n\nOne of my fav memories of that hostel was watching from our balcony drinking, as he would put out his towel and big pot and he would stand guard like a hawk with a big spoon, we would watch all the newbies shock as he would scold them and use his spoon to scrape food off peoples plates if they took too much. The worst thing is we found out he got all this food from a food bank! Meant to feed hungry Australian families not give mouthfuls of food to travellers!! \n\n\n\nThere are so many stories to tell as I was there for a month! (including the time he bled into his communal salad) but this is already too long (let me know if you want more) \n\n\n\nWait I can\u2019t not include his walking tour of the city where he took us to a house that had recently burnt down, an old warehouse and spent 20 minutes trying to unlock a lime scooter.",

We all introduced ourselves but the 2 women immediately started making plans and left us with the man. We were hungry so went out to get food and the man asked if he could join us. We got to the pub/restaurant and ordered some food and drink. Me and my partner ordered burger and chips and the man just had a coke. When the food arrived we were talking and introducing ourselves. We're from the UK and he was from America etc etc. As we were eating he proceded to just start taking food from my girlfriend's plate and eating it. He didn't say anything, just casually ate some chips. In true English fashion we said nothing and passed it off as him just being over familiar. But deep down we knew that was extremely strange to do after 10 minutes of meeting someone. We went back to the hostel and fell asleep in the dorm. The next morning the 2 women left early, again leaving us with the man. He again asked us what we were doing and asked to join us. We started to feel a bit strange about this guy but thought we'll have breakfast with him and then go our separate ways. No such luck. He continued to follow us for the entire day and by this point it seemed like he may have been autistic as he was not picking up on any signals. We eventually told him we needed some romantic time together and managed to go our separate ways. I'm convinced he did the same to the other 2 girls before we arrived and they palmed him off on to us.",

On the first pass in Tbilisi, he attached himself to my friend and I, talking near non-stop about himself, and how he had been denied entry to Iran because they were trying to force him to pay more, while basically every few seconds taking a hit from his big plastic bottle of cheap beer. When he finished that off, he grabbed another one he had hidden. He was very confrontational, and made everyone very uncomfortable, and all the while, never stopping taking about himself. \n\nLater, he appeared again in Sibiu, and this time I no longer had my friend with me. He again, launched into an expanded monologue about himself and his travels, at which point he recycled a story I had told him in Tbilisi (seemingly he was listening when he paused for a breath). Again, super abrasive and grating, but he kept hanging out in the common room of the small part of the hostel I was staying in, not his. Coming back to the hostel one day, I found him there, plastic beer in his hand, most of the way through, him saying he had \u201cjust got back in myself\u201d. The next morning I left, he was in the common room again, drinking at 7am. He asked if I was leaving, to which I said yes, and he helped himself into the room (not his) and climbed into the bed I had left. \n\nI hope to never see him again",

Then I had to put up with an old European sailor who said his sailing boat mast broke; the dude would not clean his one set of clothes he wore 24/7 (he did shower).   That was a smaller dorm of 4 beds, and he wondered why the window kept getting open.  \n\nAnymore, I\u2019ll do a dorm coming into a city as if my transportation is delayed, I\u2019m not crying about missing a full-priced hotel room.",

Some background on me: raised fairly sheltered, introvert, not a big talker, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI arrive to my \"hostel.\" Not really a hostel, but everyone had their own room with communal restrooms and a commons area. The owner (before arriving) gave me the instructions for self check-in. I walk into the building, get my key, and start finding my room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was this bearded guy in the kitchen. Only person in any of the commons area. I forgot his name, so let's call him John. He stops me and asks if I'm new here, asks which room I'm staying in, starts asking me a bunch of personal questions in regards to where I lived where \\*specifically\\* I went to university, etc. He then tells me to sit down at the table because he wanted to show me some stuff on his laptop. He pulls back a chair (that was next to his laptop) and stares at me. I assumed he wanted me to sit there, so I went to sit down and he told me to go to complete opposite side of the table. Okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe starts showing me information about government grants about my major. Genuinely useful information. Okay, cool. And then starts telling me about himself. John was a heavily bearded man, looked a bit scrappy, etc. Said he goes by Reverend John and preaches about God. Okay. Then he tells me about his Instagram and how he makes EDM songs on the side. He was very stern about me looking up his Instagram, and when I asked him the name again, he asked for my phone to type it in. Okay. So I gave him my phone and am watching him as he types it in, cause ya know, it's \\*my\\* phone and I want to see what he's doing (cause he opened up the web browser). He was visibly upset and told me that he doesn't like people staring over his shoulder, so he told me to sit back down. Understandable, but it's my phone, but ya know, whatever. I sat back down. He's couldn't find his own Instagram l o l (I also tried finding it later and couldn't find it). And then he pulled up YouTube and pulled up his EDM songs and made me listen to one in full, on my phone (still in his hand).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that exchange I went to my room and promptly booked a room elsewhere and was gone in about 5 minutes. I found out later that he subscribed to a couple of his YouTube channels (from MY phone on MY YouTube account) without telling me. Bad vibes from that dude, but it was also my first time solo traveling and I didn't want to risk anything. Maybe I overreacted, but ya, that's the only odd solo travel story I have from the 1 time I solo traveled.",

Obnoxious but whatever. \n\n2nd night,  he straight up insisted I let him read my palm. He was oddly sensual about it (really no other way to describe it)... then he told me that my life will change dramatically in 2 years and got really serious and philosophical. He even found a [potentially used] napkin to write out his prediction about my impending life change and signed it. He gave me this signed napkin forecast with the same degree of pride that one generally reserves for handing off a newborn child to its mother for the first time.

I said no - from Bangladesh. He looked very surprised. I thought he didnt know the name of my country. He said he is shocked because I have beard. I said \"so?\" He goes \"I see Bangladeshis in my country - they dont have beard\". I gently replied \"I dont think it's genetic. It's a fashion choice\"\n\nHe then proceeded briefly to know where I will be going. I said I will be in the city for couple of days more. Now, at this point, I should mention, me and him were probably the only 2 non-white person in the hostel. So here's what he said after knowing my 2 days plan:\n\"Look bro. You know how it is over here? We are different. I say we hang out together\"\nI asked \"different as in?\"\n\"We look the same. (Point at his skin). Others wont hang out with us you know...\"\n\nand just right then he stopped because my friend came downstairs and joined me - who is a white British blonde.\nI smiled at him one last time and didnt talk back.",

This was my 1st week of a 3 month solo trip around Europe on my own, so I was still a freshie to the backpacking experience. \n\nStaying in hostel dorm room with approx 10 of us from our group. Headed out for a massive night, you know the drill, shots, strong cocktails, a stumbling walk home. One of the girls (18F) came from a small country town and had never been drunk/partied hard in her life. She was a lot of fun but was totally blackout and needed help walking home. \n\nFast forward a few hours later, I\u2019m on top bunk, she\u2019s on bottom. I awake to mumbling, laughing and clapping, she\u2019s drunk sleep talking, nothing really to worry about. I then roll over to try and sleep, and hear her get up, I ignore as I\u2019m wasted and exhausted. About 10 minutes later I\u2019m overwhelmed by one of the most toxic smells I\u2019ve ever encountered. I roll over to see her coming out of the bathroom (toilet was separate to shower) I thought, hm weird the shower hasn\u2019t been on, thinking nothing of it, try to go back to sleep. This smell continues to envelop the WHOLE room, almost as if something had died in the hot summer heat. I get up and am absolutely mortified to see that this girl , while blackout drunk, has taken a massive CRAP on the floor of the bathroom, she in her drunken stupor must have thought it was the toilet. \nI tried waking her but she was out cold. Tried shutting the door and leaving a note, but the smell seeped under that door like no tomorrow and there was no way I could sleep. At this point I\u2019m delirious with no clue what to do , another girl wakes up from my rustling around and couldn\u2019t believe what was happening until she had the pleasure of seeing the humongous shit in the bathroom. We had no idea what to do. We couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of what was happening, but knew something had to be done. So with some drunken courage, I had to resort to grabbing copious amounts of toilet paper and towels and cover the shit as much as possible. We then had to use the bin trash bag and pull a \u2018dog poo\u2019 type manoeuvre where you put the bag over and flip it inside out with the poop inside, towels and all. Had to leave that bag in the hostel hallway, far away from our room, I still think about the poor person that would have found that. \n\nCouldn\u2019t look at that girl the same for the next week we travelled together for. \n\nI felt like I could do anything after this experience.",

Also every story ended with like a funny comment or a pun, so I would listen patiently and when it looked like he was finally at the punch line I would fake laugh and he would laugh as well.

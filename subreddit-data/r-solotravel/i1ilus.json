I like to spend time reading everything in each exhibit. I once spent seven hours at the British Museum \u2014 on the first floor. Anyone else enjoy this aspect of solo travel?",

I don't have to worry about other people being hungry or not, other people wanting a kebab or not, the food being in line with other people's budget or not, nor do I have to answer the pointless question of whether or not this is 'lunch' or 'dinner'. I also don't have to look around ten different kebab stands weighing up the pros and cons of each one before picking one. I sit, I eat, I watch the world go by and then I go and do something else, which I also chose myself.",

I always get the audio guide which is something most people don't want to spend the $3 on so I hate standing there listening to the guide while my companion is just sitting on the bench looking at their phone. I also like to go out of my way to visit museums that might not be as easy to reach and that's hard to convince someone to do.",

I'm a museum connoisseur and get OCD if I dont hit every wing and read every plaque to absorb the info.\n\nI was blessed to get a \"passport\" for all the museums while going to undergrad in NYC and spent most of my free time doing that. I know the Museum of Natural History like the back of my hand and it never gets old.  Dont get me wrong, I love going to museums with my significant other but nothing beats going by yourself. It's like going deep into a Wikipedia hole except you see all the magnificent stuff yourself.\n\nIt also gives you perks of surprising your dates with the really cool shit and knowing where it is once you go back. Legit, museum hopping is probably my favorite thing to do. Smoke a doobie near central park, eat something good and the city is your fucking oyster.\n\nIf anyone on here is planning on visiting NYC once we go back to normal, let me know. I made a list of the ones I like the most and have the coolest stuff to see. I'm not a learned individual or a professor or anything like that but at least that's one of the things I'm passionate about so I could give some tips. You could see T-Rex fossils, Egyptian mummies, Picasso/Van Gogh/Pollack paintings, medieval architecture, etc within a day or 2 for free or at a minimal charge.",

I end up forcing myself to take long lunches or just sit and rest for 10-15 minutes updating my travel diary because I exhaust myself.  My favorite bit of the British Museum was about forty feet from the Rosetta Tablet, where a guy build a six foot funereal tablet and then botched the last three heiroglyphs and had to smudge it over to keep from building it again.  Or the place where the guards scratched the boardgame of Ur into their city gate to deal with the boredom of their shifts. \n\nLike one day, I did the Victoria and Albert, Science, and Natural History museum in eight hours, capped by a performance at the Royal Albert Music Hall.  Just about killed myself and that was like day 3 of 6 packed days like that.  For me, vacation is an active verb.",

One of the \"real\" museum staff was close by, helping to coach her get answers. It took a long time, but they were trying to find ways to get more people there. It was such a cool time.

My cousin's patient, on the other hand, got bored very quickly and wanted to leave.\n\nSo, we left. I felt like I didn't get enough time to explore and wasted my one and only free ticket.

I love my Aunt, she is absolutely amazing and was great to travel with, but the British Museum enthralled me. I could have spent days there between the Egyptian artifacts, the clocks, the marbles, just everything. \n\nHowever, she was bored pretty quickly. She was nice enough not to say anything, but you know you can tell when it happens so I sped up.\n\nI love visiting museums on my own. I can spend a ton of time, or, if I'm not feeling it, leave. I can seek out weird or obscure ones. I can go early or late, and I can stop in the museum cafe for a ridiculously overpriced refreshment and not have to justify the cost to anyone because I just want to stay in the museum.",

Last year I went to Japan for 3 months and one of the incentives was Setouchi Triennale, an outdoor art fest held on a bunch of small islands in Seto sea [https://setouchi-artfest.jp/en/](https://setouchi-artfest.jp/en/) . I liked it so much that I may do it again in 2022.\n\nOh, and since I was in the area I did a 3 day bike ride ([https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3478.html](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3478.html)) that took me to Onomichi, a small town where some of the classic Japanese movies originated (parents in \"Tokyo Story\" live in Onomichi). They have a tiny museum documenting local filmmaking. I thought it was treat but I doubt anyone else would enjoy that.",

I am the kind who rarely relaxes too long while on holiday, and the chances of finding someone with the same level of pace as I do is very hard. None of my friends for instance have that same level of energy. Then there's the fact that I would want to see things or do things like hiking that many others would not want to do.",

Definitely recommend :)",

These days pretty much every large museum has some sort of online guide, or a book that you can get on eBay, or a VR tour, etc. \n\nAfter studying up the museum on line in detail, your visit is going to be to see those things that you already know. It is like going to visit an old friend instead of going to a meet-and-greet.\n\n\nAnd the nice thing us that now that we the travel scene is shut down due to Covid19, you have all the time to study up on these destinations.",

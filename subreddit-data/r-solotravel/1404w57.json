    "postText": "In January 2013 I left my homecountry for 17 months. My initial plan was to travel and work a little bit. After 4 months in SE Asia I went to Australia. But the Dollar had become so expensive I had to find a job. Eventually I worked and traveled in Australia for 12 months. Which was a great experience! The last 3 months I worked remote in the jungle in El Arish. So I could apply for my 2nd work visa. I hated every part of it. Most of the time I was alone. The only time of the day I talked was with my boss. Max 10 minutes. I hated the amount of non-deathly big spiders (I don\u2019t care much about ittybitty deathly ones). Two days after getting back in Brisbane, I stayed in bed for 3 days. To much sensory overload. After Australia I traveled for 5 more weeks before getting back home. \n\nBack home I applied and payed for my 2nd visa. The visa was granted. My original plan was to leave about 5 months later. This was postponed multiple times for different reasons. Eventually I never did leave. After being back for 15 months, I decided I did not want to go. My best friend told me multiple times that:\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t really want to go, you only have the idea of want to go, because that\u2019s all you wanted after coming back\u2019. \n\nIn hindsight he was right. For 17 months I never stayed put at 1 place. Being back and being at 1 place at the time was tough. Also during my travel my family fell apart. Parents divorced and both living with a new partner. Stepsister relationship was over. But she found someone new extremely quick, got pregnant, married and gave birth within those 17 months. My brother and sisters also were divided during the divorce. \n\nThirteen months after getting back home I decided to postpone it one more time. Not because I wanted to, but because I had to. My mother had to undergo a big surgery and there was big chance she had cancer. \n\nAnother reason to travel again was because I never traveled for 1 year. I never did that! But I never left. On the day my visa expired I felt bittersweet. To this day it feels bittersweet. \n\nDon\u2019t me wrong, I had great experiences and still cherish them. But the part I stayed in the jungle for 3 months for my 2nd working holiday visa. No. In hindsight it would have been better to quit my job 1 month later. Which would have given me the opportunity to travel for 2 extra months. The 3 months working and living remote in the jungle should have made it worth it. But it didn\u2019t.\n\nBut that is life. Sometimes we take a turn that isn\u2019t right one. \n\nI fought, I lost. Now I rest.",

Now im 37, and i feel like i missed out as most people backpack around the world in their 20's. Also i feel being older i wont fit in when i go out and travel now. I got caught up in jobs and other distractions from seeing the world. There so much i didnt see and experience im just starting now to try to travel more.",

I spend less time trying to connect with other travelers and more time enjoying my own company and doing what I want to do. I had a lot of nostalgia last trip, talking to a 20-something hiking buddy, remembering when I used to be selfconscious about... so much... that I don't really care about anymore.

I am 63 and travel has never been better.  When I was younger, work and family prevented the kind of travel that I enjoy most.  I'm heading to Vietnam for 3 months starting in July.  I'm not retired, and I don't plan to be, but I have designed my work to give me flexibility.",

I\u2019m glad I\u2019m older, not feeling the same social pressure to do what everyone else is doing so I can branch out, have new experiences, meet new folks, and see and understand things in new ways!",

I don\u2019t really regret it but it\u2019s a con; people will want to attach to you when they see you do things and not being more willing to be single and just grind has cost me in that I have to coordinate with another body which makes it less whimsical. It\u2019s definitely problematic, if you\u2019re SO is less athletic than you then they have to be comfortable with both of you doing separate activities and that can be tough if you\u2019re the main navigator or they don\u2019t want to be without you.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say if I could\u2019ve done much differently, I\u2019ve been too broke for much of my life to do much differently. This is some of the best outcome thus far but the above is a point I reluctantly make. Being single makes it leagues easier and also comes back and helps in dating.",

And although nowadays I can share it with my SO, it can be problematic.I always had the inner feeling to be free and I was, still am, always more adventures compared to my SO. What makes things harder these days is that she has been treated for cancer. The side effects of the treatment made her less resistant of coping with heat and she is often more and quicker tired and exhausted. This is something we still have to cope with while traveling. We have to take it slow, but taking it to slow and we get bored or are losing valuable time and travel experiences.",

Altitude sickness, unexplained prolonged problems with certain regulatory aspects of her body from seemingly blood sugar to head concerns complicate things financially for us and make me think twice about what to plan. I\u2019m really grateful for her and I wouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t ask for anyone else but it\u2019s still hard. So I can empathize. For what I can say to you, congrats to your SO beating cancer. That sounds hard and I can hear that.\n\nAs an addendum for any readers here looking on the finances of travel: I don\u2019t think in the long run dating her specifically has changed how much I travel as she\u2019s likes traveling and is proactive. I also think in my own circumstances I wouldn\u2019t have traveled more some how if I was single, we both have more money between us so to some faux opportunity cost but I think that cost is related broadly contextually to our American lower class economic sphere. If I had a professional job I\u2019d less time to travel and more money. If I had more money (via family [nothing wrong with that,]) I could produce the time to travel but neither is or can be the case. No circumstances outside of work I already (bartending/serving) do produces better results.\n\nI make this note for our European travelers with better social economies whom can make use of this advice. In general if you\u2019re in lower class America, you\u2019d in the same position I and girlfriend are in which is trying keep your head above water while making life interesting. It goes to show there was no alternative for me. I\u2019ve gone farther with her, that\u2019s been my personal financial and the general economic truth of it.",

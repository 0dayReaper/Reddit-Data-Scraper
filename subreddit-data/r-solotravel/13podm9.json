    "postText": "I'm spending close to two months traveling through Europe and I decided to buy the Eurail to travel around. Nearly every single train that requires seat reservations that I've tried to book through Eurail says that there are no longer seat reservations available. When I check for the same routes on the rail companies' websites, there are still seats available for reserve. This means that I've had to pay out of pocket for most of my trains (which can get incredibly expensive) despite having paid for a pass! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I'm incredibly annoyed as I bought this pass thinking I'd save money.",

It does take some planning- when I travelled for 4 months around Europe last summer I only had to make 5 or 6 reservations, with 3 being pennies in Poland.\n\nObviously this was not using the high speed rail in Italy. Using regional trains only. Didn\u2019t take any overnight/long long distance trips. I didn\u2019t go to France etc which I understand requires more reservations. I\u2019m not saying I did things \u2018right\u2019- but it suited my trip where I had time, was travelling short distances and didn\u2019t overall have a plan. It worked for me.\n\nBut you are totally right that the pass is just not worth the money for some trips. Busing will always be cheapest- if costs really adding up I would look at buses. On rail app search for trains without reservations and see what you get. If you are moving to Central Europe reservations aren\u2019t really required. Hope your enjoying your trip regardless \ud83d\ude43",

            "comment": "I can totally understand your frustration in regards to expensive mandatory seat reservations, sounds like you started your journey in France or Spain. This is a very common grievance with the Eurail / Interrail pass in those two countries. Expensive mandatory seat reservation fees are often attributed to Eurail, when it\u2019s actually the national operators that set the price. This isn't necessarily the fault of the Eurail pass, rather it is Renfe in Spain or SNCF in France that are a somewhat 'hostile' towards the Eurail / Interrail pass. Some issues are inherent to a system that requires compulsory seat reservations, such as a general reduced passenger capacity, which can be made worse by operators, like SNCF or Renfe, that underutilise their high-speed network (e.g. Paris-Barcelona or Madrid-Santiago de Compostela). SNCF is also a particular bad example, when it comes to charging sky-high reservations fees for Eurail pass holders on its intra-European routes (to Switzerland, Belgium, Spain, Italy). Essentially the Eurail pass is only ever as good as the respective national operator.\n\nThe Eurail (and Interrail pass) is never a one size fits all kinda pass. You'll have to do a bit of research in advance whether it makes sense for your specific kind of travels. These factors can be of various nature (e.g. environmental concerns, budget-conscious, pace of travel, flexibility etc.). r/Interrail is a very helpful sub for any kind of railways related question that you might have. Arguably, the railway network in Europe can be difficult to make sense off for tourists and locals alike. The [Man in Seat 61](https://www.seat61.com/interrail-and-eurail-reservations.htm) has a really helpful reservations guide for Eurail pass holders (in general that website is incredibly useful for any tourists that uses the railways in Europe).\n\nOne can think of the Eurail pass as being on a spectrum that ranges from fantastic value to 'you're better off buying individual tickets'. For example, the Eurail pass can be of fantastic value in the Nordic countries, the UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Benelux countries. All of these countries don't have mandatory seat reservations, which means you can just hop on any train you like. Speaking from own experience, the Interrail pass proved to be so worthwhile in the UK as I saved lots of money. Even countries (e.g. Sweden or Italy) with mandatory seat reservations on high-speed rail can be great places to explore with an Eurail pass. In Eastern Europe, one is generally better off buying individual tickets as the ticket prices are cheap anyways.",

Not all trains participated and you need reservations, which as you know aren't always compatible.\n\nSadly I think a lot of transport passes geared towards tourists are not a discount.  My home town of Boston has a day pass but you need to ride the train like 5 times before you start saving money, which in a small city is just unnecessary.",

            "comment": "I used a Eurail pass successfully the last two summers; specifically because I avoided France and Spain.  in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and even Italy it was great.  it did save a small amount of money versus the individual tickets for the intercity trips I was taking to move around Europe, but it isn't a massive windfall like JR.\n\nThe thing you do have to remember is that you will have to pay out of pocket, and should get a seat reservation in most countries - because most of these trains are full almost all the time, and these should be purchased as far in advance as possible.  so, Eurail passes are not nearly as much benefit for spur of the moment travel.  I used mine for planned or scheduled intercity moves or destination travel and local day trips I just paid out of pocket entirely.\nmy only frustration was in dealing with the transfer between Deutsche Bahn and SNCB when DB canceled a train on me out of Bruxelles, and I was forced to scramble to change to Thalys tickets.\n\n\nin general, you purchase a seat reservation, then on the day of the travel you can sit in any seat that's available because you know you have one reserved and you can fall back on that seat if you need to.  In the UK there's usually enough availability that you can just hop on a train, but in most of Europe that's not practical.\n\nIt's not like a Japan Rail pass where it's a Willy Wonka golden ticket for basically any seat anywhere anytime.",

I had an issue getting a train out of London, so I ended up having to book a last minute plane ticket. I guess my tip for you, is keep an eye on the seat reservations and the train availability. As soon as you know your next and any future destinations for your trip, make sure to book the tickets for it. Decide on a day you\u2019ll leave and grab a reservation while they\u2019re available.",

I liked that I could wait until the day before or day of, and get a ticket for the cost of the reservation (was usually 8-10 euro iirc). I was pretty bummed about paying those at first, but it made things a bit more flexible. \n\nThe local trains being included was super convenient in places like Genoa/cinque Terre. But then I had to spend 80 euro on a last minute ticket to get out of France that wasn\u2019t covered, and I wasn\u2019t aware of it until last minute.\n\nOverall, it depends on the places you\u2019re going and wether or not you have set plans, I think. Just try to get reservations at the train station the day before, or early morning of. Or if you know for sure you\u2019ll be in a place for only x amount of days, just get the reservation right when you get to the destination.",

            "comment": "Years ago, decades ago the '70s to be exact you're real used to be a great experience when I was a student. Probably was for many decades after that as well. But I revisited the thought as I travel to Europe every year. But I came to that conclusion, today there are just way too many restrictions, tickets prepaid online everything reserved and what a pain it would be... I have found that train travel is so goddamn reasonable in Europe that taking a fast train from Amsterdam to antwerpen, to Paris, to Strasburg, to Stuttgart etc all as individual tickets was very efficient and not a problem at all cost-wise..\n\nMoreover, I was so pleased that wherever I got on the train, I found my seat easily and in the one and two cases where someone was sitting on my window seat they just automatically looked at me and moved without me even having to ask.. that was pleasant indeed..\n\n\nI'll travel again this fall for a month and a half and I think I will do the same. Book everything online, everything in advance and just arrive with my phone. For me I think the pass is just out of the question for getting to location to location. Occasionally I rent a car if I really wanted to get into the country and if I'm in a city for 4:00 or 5:00 or 6 days I definitely buy a street car pass. That's definitely worth it",

For years it was auto Europe out of Portland Maine and it always had to be done stateside before you went for the best deals. But the internet continue to change everything and over the last five or six years it could be Europa car and last year  Sixt, All arranged online. Never walk in to the office to make arrangements to get a car you'll never get the best deal.. also beware of one way fees and be willing to juggle. The easiest is simply start in the city and return it to a city but sometimes or sometimes does not work out for me. This last trip I wanted to rent a car in Strasburg France and return it in Amsterdam and that turned out to be it outrageously expensive affair but by taking the express to Stuttgart, I shaved hundreds and hundreds of dollars off the price. Major cities always have the best deals and certain countries the better policies. I always find Sherman easy to rent in flexibility key but go online for rates. I've been in Berlin wanting to rent a car walked into Europa car and have been quoted a very expensive thing and then go back out on the sidewalk and do it online and find a deal etc. The market fluctuates all the time there is no standard price, it's in algorithm all based on demand.. last year in Stuttgart I attempted to rent just a three basic five on the floor smallest economy car and instead they shoved me into a very very expensive four-door luxury Audi that I guess nobody wanted at the moment, of course for the same price at first I was a bored at the size of the beast but ultimately on the highway it certainly was a sweet machine and pretty well sipped gas very good luck with it",

And it's still applies Just go online for rental cars and see what's out there and when and be flexible. If one destination doesn't work juggle. Always big city to big city is the best and cheapest is big city return to the same big city but you will find amazing deals. Certain cross borders create problems. Kara's out of the Netherland into central Europe one way are absurdly costly. For example easier to take the train from Amsterdam to Cologne and rent etc. East block also sometimes problematic but not Poland or Czechia",

    "postText": "Hello! I have been researching into Costa Rica for the past couple weeks and have decided to make it my destination for my first real trip. I fell in love with this place and haven\u2019t even been there yet. But, it seems the more I research about it, the more overwhelmed I feel. \n\nI will be traveling by myself (obviously) and am a male in my early 20s. As far as a budget goes, I\u2019m hoping not to spend more than 1200$ on flight and rooms for a 4-5 night stay (Coming from the US)\n\nI really want my trip to be focused on hiking and nature. I want to see rainforests, waterfalls, springs, volcanoes etc. I don\u2019t really care to see any beaches during this trip, or atleast not make them the focal point. I\u2019d rather find one good hotel to stay at instead of hopping from place to place. I heard that La Fortuna is great for exploring and nature, but it\u2019s 2 1/2 hours from the San Jose airport. Should this distance make me nervous, or would bussing there be no problem?\n\nAny advice on any good hotels or places to go that would put me in the center of any national parks and natural sights would be much appreciated. My biggest concern is just having to travel far from my hotel to see different places each day. Thanks in advance!",

You have access to Tabacon hot springs (free), la fortuna falls (cheap) can climb arenal volcano (I think it was $30? \n\nThe month and a half I lived there I only used public transit, busing should be really easy if I remember busses usually cost anywhere from 1-5 dollars, don\u2019t quote me it\u2019s been almost a year. \n\nIf you decide you want to stay longer monteverde and Manuel Antonio is awesome as well but would take a day to get to",

The Nature in Costa Rica is amazing so leave the capital as soon as possible. The roads are not the best, so expect delays and longer travel times. Bring USD, a lot of places accept USD. They have an unofficial exchange rate they use for calculation which is sometime below or above the actual real exchange rate. Because of this USD can be cheaper than paying with colones. I was able to pay with USD cash and card for everything. I only got colones as one place could only give me the change in colones.",

            "comment": "I went to La Fortuna during my first trip to Costa Rica. I think it is absolutely worth it.\n\nIt is a few hours shuttle ride from the airport and yes the roads are very curvy and nerve wracking. If you arrive at the airport early enough then it should be no problem getting there before sundown.\n\nI\u2019d recommend doing the Cerro Chato hike. You go up the smaller volcano next to Arenal and the crater is filled with a lake that you can go swimming in. I also did a day long tour of all sites in the area like the cloud jungles and the waterfall. \n\nThere\u2019s lots of hot spring resorts in the area that are pricey but there are a few public hot springs that you can just walk to. I can\u2019t remember specifically where they are but just ask around. \n\nYou said you don\u2019t care about beaches, but you should definitely consider going to Manuel Antonio. There\u2019s a national park there with lots of wildlife like capuchin monkeys (yes they will try to steal your stuff), sloths, toucans, colorful frogs and birds. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like beaches, then avoid Tamarindo since that is basically just a surfer town.",

It still takes several hours to get across the country. It took about 4 hours to get to Manuel Antonio from La Fortuna.\n\nI just stayed in backpacker hostels. It\u2019s a great way to meet other people who you can explore with.",

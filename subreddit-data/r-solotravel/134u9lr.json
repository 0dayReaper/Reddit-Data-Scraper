    "postText": "So I (F27) am visiting Australia in November of this year, and I'm starting to narrow down the details of where/what I want to do. I'll be there for 15 days, 6 of which I will be in Melbourne visiting a friend. For the other 9 days I will be traveling alone. I've done short weekend solo trips within the US before, but I've never done anything like this (first time overseas), and the planning part is getting a bit overwhelming. Here's what I have so far:\n\n**3 nights in Sydney:**\n\n\\- Obviously I want to see the harbor and the beaches and whatnot.\n\n\\- It looks like the orchestra will be performing at the opera house when I'm there which is totally up my alley\n\n\\- Mostly I really want to make some hostel friends, explore the city, eat good food and drink cute drinks. Not sure I want to cram a million activities in while my body is adjusting to the time change.\n\n**3 nights in Brisbane:**\n\n\\- Meet some koalas (everyone I know who has done this said it was overrated but also. Koalas.)\n\n\\- Australia zoo\n\n**3 nights in Cairns:**\n\n\\- So I'd really like to see the great barrier reef. Snorkeling would be super cool, but I'm not the strongest swimmer, so idk if that's a good idea. I'm looking at other options\n\n\\- Also really want to see rainforests. I'm currently looking at the skyrail and/or the kuranda railway.\n\nThen I'd be heading to Melbourne where I won't be traveling solo.\n\n**Also, some questions:**\n\n\\- Will three nights in each city be enough?\n\n\\- After flights, I'm hoping to budget $2000 USD/$3000 AUD. Will this be enough? This amount also includes my week in Melbourne, where I won't need to pay for lodging, but still will be spending money.\n\n\\- Can anyone recommend more social hostels?\n\n\\- I won't have access to a car. As I understand it, public transit in Australia is good and reliable, but will not driving be limiting at all?\n\n\\- Safety-wise, will I be alright alone? I live in a pretty crime-heavy city as-is, but it's another thing altogether to be in a completely different country and not have your bearings. Anything I should be aware of as far as staying safe?\n\nAnyway, this is still kind of a loose plan, so if anyone has any feedback on anything or can offer any advice, that would be amazing.",

Just observe the usual common sense precautions you would anywhere (e.g. take care if you\u2019re in nightlife districts late at night and protect your stuff against petty theft). Australia has low crime rates, and doesn\u2019t have pick pockets, etc, targeting tourists.\n\nBrisbane is inland, so isn\u2019t a good place to go to the beach from. Sydney has excellent beaches. It will be stinger season in Cairns, so you\u2019ll need a wetsuit. \n\nDefinitely go to the Opera House in Sydney. It\u2019s an amazing venue, and has recently had a major upgrade. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested in zoos, go to Taronga Zoo in Sydney. It\u2019s one of the best in the world. I\u2019d suggest going there instead of Australia Zoo. The Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary in Brisbane lets you hold koalas and interact with other native wildlife.\n\nThe jet lag from flying between the US and Australia can be brutal. I\u2019d suggest adding a day or so to Sydney, and reducing your time in Brisbane. If you can add extra time to the trip, I\u2019d suggest doing so.\n\nPublic transport is quite good in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Not sure about Cairns.",

Fly into Queensland and do that, then down to Sydney, then to Melbourne (just geographically it makes more sense to line up the cities north to south like that).\n\nNo problems without a car if you're sticking to the cities - Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney have easy public transport for all the places you'd want to go, and Cairns seems easy enough to get around by walking.\n\nFor Sydney, definitely do the Spit to Manly walk and then swim at Manly beach, or do the Coogee to Bondi walk (or vice versa) and swim at one/some of the many beaches along that route. Stunning scenery, easy walks, plenty of cafes and beaches along both routes.\n\nAlso in Sydney, take the ferry from Circular Quay to Milson's Point and check out Wendy Whiteley's secret garden, then either walk across the Harbour Bridge or take another ferry back. Explore the Rocks, the Botanic Gardens, the Art Gallery of NSW, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Opera House all in that area. A whole day's (or two days if you're a museum fan) worth of activities in, like, 400 square metres. Absolutely a must for anyone visiting the city for the first time.",

Anyway, check out GOMA and see what\u2019s on at QPAC, powerhouse also has arty events on.\n\nAlthough if you want some beach time I\u2019d suggest flying from Sydney to Sunshine Coast, Australia zoo is a bit closer there.",

            "comment": "I just got back from my trip to Australia (Sydney and Melbourne) which was also my first trip overseas from the US.\n\nThree nights in Sydney isn't enough IMO, I spent 5 nights there and I honestly wouldn't have minded staying longer. I was also never jet lagged, so if that might be a problem for you definitely stay longer. Trying to fit 3 cities in 9 days is pushing it. There's plenty to do in Sydney, especially if you're wanting to do a beach day. I didn't visit Brisbane but I'm not sure it's worth visiting if it means spending only 3 days in Cairns and Sydney. \n\n$2000 USD is pretty low if you're planning on eating out and having the occasional drink. I found going out cheaper than it is in the US (mainly due to the favorable exchange rate, no tipping, and tax included) but it adds up quickly. \n\nPublic Transit in Sydney and Melbourne is fantastic, you won't have any problem getting around without a car. \n\nAustralia is probably one of the safest places for solo female travel. I never felt uncomfortable let alone unsafe (although I'm a guy). I also saw plenty of women walking alone late at night, it didn't really seem like it's unusual or sketchy there like it can be in larger US cities. You also shouldn't feel like you're out of your element in Australia, it's very similar to the US and there is no language barrier. \n\n\nRandom bit of advice, but make sure you have a contactless credit card with no foreign transaction fees. Everything is tap to pay there, and I probably put no less than 100 separate charges on my CC in 2 weeks.",

Since I was able to sleep most of the way the local time felt about right to me, it was just Wednesday morning instead of Tuesday morning. I think everyone handles jet lag differently, I've worked graveyard shifts for 6 of the last 10 years so I'm used to my sleep pattern always changing.\n\nYour debit card will work (just make sure you put a travel notice in with your bank) but you'll likely incur quite a bit of fees. All of my banks charged at least $1 per transaction and  then a percentage of the transaction to convert AUD to USD. You'll have to check with your bank to see their fees. Withdrawing cash in bulk from an ATM will save you money but cash is not commonly used from my experience and I think quite a few places won't take it. \n\nI probably saved at least $150 USD by having a no foreign transaction fee CC. It's not necessary but something to consider.",

I feel like its worth chucking an extra day or two onto Sydney though as theres heaps to do and you need to take into account recovery from the trip over.\n\n$3000 AUD may be a little bit tight but not impossible. Australia is quite an expensive country.\n\nHostels - YHA's are awesome and so is the Wake Up hostel in Sydney, both very social. I've stayed in two YHA's, they're located in every capital city.\n\nPublic transport is great in Sydney and Melbourne with trams, trains and buses. Brisbane relies more on buses but also has trains. Cairns I'm not sure about, but not being a capital city I'd say it would be mainly buses. You can still get around easily though, just make sure you have the right transport cards - except Sydney, you can tap on and off with your debit/credit card (physical, you can't use Apple Pay for this).\n\nI've lived here my entire life and have never felt unsafe walking around at night. In any crime-heavy areas there is higher police presence and the coppers are pretty nice so I wouldn't stress. It's a pretty safe country.\n\nOne thing though - Australia Zoo is actually on the Sunshine Coast, just over an hours drive north of Brissy. There are public transport options between the town the Zoo is in and Brisbane though so have a look into that.",

It\u2019s memorable. \n\n\nOther than the reef, cairns isn\u2019t very interesting to me. Ymmv\n\n\nAus zoo is great but can be difficult to get to. Check out transport options carefully. (From memory the buses weren\u2019t working one time and it was hard to get from bus stop to zoo.)\n\n\nThere are plenty of places to see or even hold a koala eg taronga zoo Sydney as someone else recommended. \n\n\nBrisbane beaches are useless but you can catch a train to the Gold Coast for the day (or stay the night). This could be a more relaxing couple of days on the beach and walking around surfers people watching. Or go to the theme parks and party all night if you want to. \n\n\nJust take the usual safety precautions.",

I have enjoyed every place I\u2019ve been in the country, but Sydney is my favorite, so if you add any additional days to your itinerary, you won\u2019t run out of stuff to do. That time of the year is usually nice, and you\u2019ll be able to do you museums, hiking, and explore all the beaches during the day and enjoy the nightlife in the evenings. One of the things I like about the city is that it offers pretty much everything you may want in a vacation. And it\u2019s all safe, just as is the entire country. \n\nFor Cairns, I think, even if you\u2019re not a strong swimmer, you enjoy snorkeling. When I went, I had planned to snorkel, but then the tour guides convinced me to try diving. I forget what the program was called, but you can essentially dive with a certified diver and not have to be certified yourself. You had to take a course on the boat ride out. I can\u2019t remember if it was an hour or two ride out to the reef. On the tour boat, I went on, you could just go to swimming, snorkeling, stay on the boat, or dive. Just remember if you do end up doing the diving option you have to wait so many hours before you get on an airplane. \n\nMelbourne is also cool\u2026 but there are a lot of things to do outside the city that do require a lot of driving, if you\u2019re interested. Although time may not be on your side. The Great Ocean Road, going to see the penguins at Phillip island, etc. Have fun planning!",

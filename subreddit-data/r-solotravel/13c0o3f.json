My question is, are there points that you can ONLY use to upgrade to business class, or priority boarding, etc.? I assume my friend could just be flying for free a lot with all these points, but she\u2019s just burning it on upgrades instead. Is that accurate? How does this work?",

            "comment": "There is some logic to this approach if you have the cash and want to fly higher tiers or get upgrades. She is earning both credit card points and airline points (toward status) by paying by credit card for the initial ticket. Airline status is often tied to cash spend and obtaining higher status will help her earn points more quickly and be more likely to receive or be eligible for upgrades. And since points programs are frequently devalued, it doesn't always make sense to hoard points unless you are planning for something specific. One of the challenges of the points game is the constant need to generate points, and this is an approach that helps to generate them through travel (where you would not if you paid solely with points), albeit at a slower rate than the traditional credit card churn and burn game.",

Business class is comfy, yes, but I don\u2019t really see the point of spending the money for some hours of sitting on a more comfy seat or at a mediocre airport lounge. I\u2019d rather use the money elsewhere when I\u2019m travelling - a nicer hotel or a better sightseeing experience. This view might change when I\u2019m older still and need my bodily comfort more, but at 34, I\u2019m managing just fine in coach and knowing I didn\u2019t spend money on my tickets.",

            "comment": "Buying the business class tickets outright with points or miles is usually a better value than buying an Econ ticket and upgrading later.  Now, some airlines give out \u201cpoints\u201d to high tier status members that can be used for upgrades, e.g. United\u2019s are called Pluspoints, but that\u2019s a different situation.  If we\u2019re talking about amex points, many cardholders actually have no idea what they should be doing with their points and end up wasting the value.  The best thing to do with them generally is transfer to an airline partner and redeem them for an award ticket, but many people can\u2019t figure this out or don\u2019t want to be bothered, and instead purchase the ticket with points for a rate of one cent per point.  For example, you might be able to use 80,000 points on Singapore airlines to buy a $3000 business class ticket, which would value the points at about four cents each, or you could buy the $3000 ticket on the amex website and \u201cpay with points,\u201d spending 300,000 points.  It takes some time to really figure out how to maximize the value.  So yeah, it\u2019s hard to say exactly how your friend is doing value-wise, but she could certainly be using points to upgrade her pre-purchased economy flights.",

            "comment": "It's the same points to upgrade as to book new flights. \n\nHowever, it's usually much more economical to book a business class ticket vs economy with points rather than cash - in just round figures, I assume I'm going to spend about 2x as many points to book business compared to economy, but when paying cash it's usually more like 8-10x. \n\nAlso, for people who play the points game, it's very easy to have points become much easier to get than time to travel. If you have time for 3 long haul trips a year, that's 200-400K points a year for business class travel vs. 100-200K points for economy. If I can earn 400K airline points a year, why wouldn't I book the business class?",

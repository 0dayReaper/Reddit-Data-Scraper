    "postText": "Is 3 weeks enough time to appreciate California? I'm from the UK and will be doing a solo road trip in May 2024, here's my route:\n\nI'll be heading to LA from London, hiring a car for a month and doing this route. I fly into LA on May 1st 2024:\n\nLA  &gt; Joshua Tree &gt; Death Valley &gt; Lake Tahoe &gt; Yosemite &gt;  San Francisco &gt; Monterey/Carmel/Big Sur &gt; Santa Barbara &gt; LA.\n\nHere's a map to show exactly the route for each leg of the trip: Link\n\nI thought this is a good mix of sights as you get to explore the natural beauty of California (Pacific Coast Highway, Big Sur, Carmel, Yosemite, Lake Tahoe, The Deserts, Eastern Sierras, etc.)  but then you also get good exposure to the cities and towns like LA, SF, Santa Barbara, etc.\n\nHere's how much time I plan on spending in each place total: \n\n**LA** \\- 2 nights - *(1 day at beginning of trip and 1 day at end when leaving) (airbnb)* \n\n**Joshua Tree** \\- 3 nights - *(airbnb)* \n\n**Death Valley** \\- 1 night - *(The Inn Hotel)* \n\n**Lake Tahoe** \\- 3 nights -  *(airbnb)* \n\n**Yosemite** \\- 3 nights - *(Tent Cabin onsite Curry Village)* \n\n**San Francisco** \\- 1 night - *(hotel with secure car parking/airbnb with parking)* \n\n**Carmel** \\- 3 nights - *(airbnb)* \n\n**Big Sur** \\- 1 night - *(The Madonna Inn)* \n\n**Santa Barbara** \\- 2 nights - *(airbnb)*\n\nHere's a rough itinerary for the 21 days, including 1 buffer day: Link\n\nIs this enough time to appreciate each place, or do I need to remove some places because I'm trying to do too much in the time-frame? Anything you would cut or add? Thank you",

            "comment": "This looks like an amazing trip!! I'd consider adding an extra day in LA/SF and taking one off Carmel or Joshua Tree (or both?). You can do Monterey and Carmel both in the same day unless there's something specific you're trying to do in that area. LA is definitely worth more than an entrance/exit point but it's so big, it makes it hard to do more than one area in the same day. SF is more transit friendly and walkable tho, makes it easier to pack more in a day. \n   \nAnother idea is to stay 2 nights outside of SF but in a BART-able area that allows for transit access to the city. Or you could stay somewhere bougie like Sausalito or Tiburon and take the ferry into SF. Those towns would get you closer to Muir Woods too, an amazing old growth redwood forest in Marin County.    \n   \nAnd finally, on the drive down from SB back to LA, I'd highly recommend stopping at El Matador and Zuma Beaches along the way. Sunset is gorgeous but then you have to make the drive into LA in the dark so I'd recommend going early enough to try and beat evening rush hour traffic. But it's been about 10 years since I've been to those beaches so take that with a grain of salt.     \n    \nI hope you have a great time!!! You'll love California!",

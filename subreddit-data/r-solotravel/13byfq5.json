I'd rather not just buy one for the event and leave it, it's a big thing in the UK recently with people using camping gear once and then just abandoning it when they leave. \n\nCurrently I have the MH100 as when I bought it the smaller version was out of stock, it's a bit too big for me but it is a good tent. At 4.1kg it's not exactly light but if I want a black out tent then the smaller version is still 3kg (the black out is really nice, especially at a summer festival where the sun can rise about 4am when you're hungover and they're a lot cooler in case of a heatwave).\n\nI've just got a few bits of Decathlon's Forclaz line which is kinda light whilst being about 20% the cost of true ultralight kit.",

I usually just put my whole hiking backpack in a duffel and check it and just bring a smaller bag as a personal item for the flight.",

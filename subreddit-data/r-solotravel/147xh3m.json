I know if you\u2019re from the Netherlands and one of your medications is on that list (Ritalin or adderall are) you need it to legally leave. But you might be safe but I would make some calls and triple check. I just asked my Dutch buddy who travels a lot and has friends like myself who come and stay with him and will edit this with an update\n\nEdit: Talked to my buddy in Rotterdam, he said as long as you\u2019re not going through customs there, which you shouldn\u2019t be as it\u2019s a connecting flight stop, you should be golden.",

            "comment": "You don't need it as long as you're just passing through the airport. If you're entering the country you'll need the paperwork but it has been my experience that it's merely a formality. Always good to have it just in case if you're heading in. It's good to keep a note with a list of prescriptions and why you take them from your doctor.\n\nEdit: keep several copies of this doctor's note\n\nSecond edit: Relax. It's okay. It seems scary but it's not. I just did this all over Asia where Adderall isn't okay at all. Nobody checked it but my paperwork was in order. It always seems scarier than it is.",

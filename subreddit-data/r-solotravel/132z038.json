    "postText": "Hi! I'm a 22 year-old Indian student at Hong Kong, and I'll be traveling in Vietnam from **May 26-June 4**. Here's my rough itinerary so far - \n\n26 May (night) - landing in HCMC \n\n27 May - exploring **HCMC**, visiting museums (leaning towards War Remnants Museum, Museum of Vietnamese History and maybe Fine Arts Museum because it looks pretty) \n\n28 May - **Cu Chi tunnels**  \\+ cushion room for when things will inevitably go wrong ahaha \n\n29 May - Landing in **Hanoi**, exploring Hanoi (Train Street + Book Street are 2 things I really want to see) \n\n30 May - Day trip to **Sapa** \n\n31 May + 1 June - I want to do a **Ninh Binh** 2 day trip (something like this - [https://www.klook.com/en-HK/activity/25850-2d1n-ninh-binh-tour-hanoi/](https://www.klook.com/en-HK/activity/25850-2d1n-ninh-binh-tour-hanoi/)) \n\n2 June + 3 June - I'm debating going to **Halong Bay** but I've heard mixed reviews. Open to any suggestions! \n\n4 June - Flying back to HCMC for half a day\n\nI'll probably be accompanied by a friend (21M) in North Vietnam, but we're super open to any other travelers joining us! So **let us know if you'd like to travel with us**. \n\nI'd love to hear **suggestions for lesser known things to do in the north** (I'll be there between 29 May and June 2). Is **Halong Bay worth traveling to**/spending 2 nights in? Also would be glad for **recommendations for package tours, ideally ones with local homestays** included.",

If you don't have a few days available for Sapa, you might do the Ninh Binh day tour instead.\n\nOr skip Halong all together and spend a few nights in Trang An and explore Ninh Binh area.\n\nHanoi on it's own is worth 3 days, especially if you like to explore the food culture.\n\nAlso a note about Cu Chi tunnels, these are made-for-tourism replicas, they aren't originals.\n\nHappy travels!",

I did a one night cruise and would say that\u2019s really all you need. If anything, I wish I\u2019d just done a day trip because the boat experience is so rushed. Spend more time in Hanoi, it\u2019s incredible and better the day after you get used to the commotion. The Prison memorial is so moving and worth checking out",

And of course \u201cca phe sua da\u201d(vietnamese ice coffee).\n\nIf you end up changing your itinerary or have more time, Hoi An is touristy but still pretty beautiful (lanterns at night in old town). And its a day trip from Da Nang (coastal town in the center of Vietnam).",

It's about 2 hours out of HCMC (4 hours round trip) for some tunnels that were rebuilt by the museum. There's some neat exhibits of the traps, but not really worth 4 hours of driving on such a short trip.",

I felt it was the most cultural part of my trip, but the part i enjoyed the least, so id cut it completely from your itinerary and save it for a future visit. Used sapa sisters for this.\n\nIm gonna go against the grain and say cu chi tunnels, and halong bay/cat ba (from what i understand, the boat tours are from different points but tend to cover the same area? i left from catba and they said we were in halong bay for a big part of the trip) were trip definingly good. \n\nAt cu chi tunnels, you get to hide in some ambush holes, see traps, then crawl underground through the tunnels (very uncomfortable, but cool), and i had done it part of an entire day tour where i also visited some other things (like a paint lacquer art maker). Its very iconic\n\nFor cat ba/halong bay, did 2D1N tour (specifically from cat ba), entire time on a boat, it involved kayaking through caves to check out islands for monkey spotting, along with some swimming trips, and then just enjoying the rocks go by as the ship moves. \n\nTheres a fair amount of things to do in the north, but idk if youd really have time for it. Id cut sapa and add a day to hanoi.",

Sapa has become a very touristy destination the past few years and the town itself is extremely busy and filled with scooters. I would recommend a trek to the surrounding villages and spending time in the homestays there. Let me know if you need a guide for that.  \n\nHalong bay is not the most exciting place and an overnight stay there will be expensive. A day trip there is possible where you can see the sights but not spend too much time and money.",

    "postText": "So, I spent all last week hoping someone would sign up for the Oxalis [Hang Ba Deep Jungle Expedition](https://oxalisadventure.com/tour/hang-ba-deep-jungle-expedition/) since they only run it with minimum 2, maximum 6 people and, with 6 places available, they wouldn't run it for just me.\n\nGot an email while I was cooking to say party of 5 had booked, and i could grab the last place.  Lept on to the pc to fill out the application.  Upload evidence of why I think I can physically do the tour.  Pay my ridiculous fee (-returning customer discount).  A John Prine Illegal Smile all across my face.  Things are looking pretty good.  Everything I was cooking has burnt dry.  I don't care.\n\nFast forward a few days, and i get an email to say the other party of 5 are ghosting.  Slots get freed leaving just me booked.\n\nA couple of days prior to tour date, I get an email saying ghosts are ghosting and nobody else has booked, so, given I've paid and all, do I want to go ahead with just me.  Well, as a solo traveler, this is the best possible outcome.\n\nSo off tomorrow morning, all on my own with my guide, a safety guy, maybe a park ranger, a cook and some porters.\n\nAnyone else lucked out like that?",

And the food is excellent too.\n\n(They don't (or didn't) do the returning customer discount for Son Doong.  Haven't given up on it yet, but is a shed load of cash.)",

I watched the tour video of what you\u2019re about to do to learn about this expedition and instantly got transported back to Phong Nha, I miss it dearly. And god the food, that province is already known for some of the best food in Vietnam and these tours don't hold back",

You are gated how far you can travel per day by altitude anyway, so how does it really matter if you reach the day's destination in 4 hours or 9 hours\n\nI started out my EBC trek with a group I met in Namche, the first day they blazed past me, and decided to stop at a village 2 hours farther than me, but in the end I ended up reaching EBC 3 days before them because they got sick, and I even skipped a rest day on the way (because I met a cute girl who had completed her rest day &amp; Im a dumbass in that way). Its pretty useful to go really slow and not push yourself at all until you reach the top imo",

Meeting new people in a hostel during a trip that you have otherwise planned yourself is perfectly natural.\n\nAn organised tour is something else. It is paying a company to escort you (and usually others) on a trip that they have pre-planned. You are tied to their itinerary. It is certainly useful in some circumstances - and I'm not claiming it is any less fun or rewarding - but (in my opinion) it is not solo travel.",

You don't see the difference between using restaurants, hotels and buses... and going on an organised tour? I find that quite shocking.\n\nLet me put it another way; when you join an organised tour, you will be accompanied by the tour guide and the other tour members for the duration of the tour. You'll be alongside the same people on the first day of the tour as you are on the last day of the tour - whether you enjoy their company or not. Your day-to-day routine for the duration of the tour will be whatever the tour guide has planned.\n\nIf you are travelling solo, you'll meet people in hostels and you'll leave them behind when you (or they) move on.  You'll use buses, but perhaps you'll decide to stay an extra day and catch tomorrow's bus - because you have the freedom to do that.\n\nFor me, that's what solo travel is; the freedom to do what I want, without being bound to somebody else's itinerary.",

Currently my problem as a solo traveler wanting to do volcano hikes in Nicaragua. \n\nPeople keep signing up for the hikes that require a minimum of 3 people, then ghosting and the tour gets cancelled cuz there's no longer the minimum. Collected my refund today for one company that required pre-payment. \n\nOther company I didn't pay, but the 3 others signed up did - that one I'm thinking the company cancelled or lied and just didn't want me going with them after I asked about walking sticks and they said they don't provide them because there's nowhere to buy it in Nicaragua, but I have to bring my own... But there's nowhere to buy them here \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nSo probably for the best I didn't go with them anyway. The whole reason to pay for these tour companies is because they're the places that are MEANT to have the hiking equipment difficult to find elsewhere.\n\nNever heard of the companies or that place you mention, so I'm assuming it's an intense multi-day trek (asking for proof of physical ability makes me imagine you send videos of your workout routine \ud83d\ude02). \n\nI think I'd be fine doing a hike or trek without others, especially if it requires uphill walking cuz I physically cannot talk while going uphill unless I don't want to breathe. And also then I wouldn't be left behind if it's just 1 guide and many faster hikers.\n\nBut like I did a free walking tour where I was the only one who showed up and it felt so awkward being 1 on 1. Geez in West Africa it was the worst being the only one on some of those tours, the men and children over there are the worst I've met so far.",

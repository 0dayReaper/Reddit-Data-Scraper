    "postText": "The more I solo travel, the more I want to do more of it. After visiting new cities and countries I'm only looking to do stuff that is not my daily monotonous boring life. My bank account and other random attachements (family, friends and especially work) are not liking it either. I have trouble financing my trips too but thats for another day.\n\nThe moment I arrive back after a trip, I'm only thinking about planning the next one.\n\nSometimes I feel like taking all my life savings and move to somewhere in SE asia or South America, living on like 10 bucks a day.\n\nThis feeling only disappears when I embark on a trip but the moment I'm back, boom. Post travel depression. I suppose this is widely talked about in this sub but I really hate this feeling because no matter how hard I try, I haven't and won't be content with the life I live when I'm not traveling.\n\nSorry for this lil rant, it's been on my mind since my last trip, you might get a pt2 once I'm back from my next trip.\n\n~~Is there anyone else combating against this feeling? How do you cope with it?~~\n\nEdit: MY dumbass has found a number of posts exactly like mine with help about this.  Enjoy my rant :)",

I guess I have two pieces of advice...one would be to consider if there's anything specific that makes coming home feel so painful, other than the fact that it's not traveling. You might be able to find some ways to make your non-travel life more fulfilling or more similar to your travel life, at least within reason. Otherwise you could always think about ways to travel more full-time and still making it sustainable...becoming a \"digital nomad\" for instance or finding career paths involving frequent travel.",

I was never happy seeing my parents and siblings because of our dramatic personality differences. But then after meeting my lovely wife, I soon to realize I was never happy at home. Traveling gave me the experience to start over and meet strangers. See if they even like me from their first impressions of me. Small portions dont but most do and end up getting to know more personally with them than my own family.\n\nBut since I have my own family now (wife and 2 kids), I have a reason to love staying home but I still love to solo travel. I used to go overseas 4 or 5 times a year before I  had my kids. Now I go once every few years. Once they are old enough and know why I do it, I will probably continue going multiple times a year.

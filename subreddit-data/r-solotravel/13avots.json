    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m planning a solo trip to Eastern Europe/the Balkans and I am having a hard time organizing my travel from Budapest to Split. I got the Eurail pass, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t let me reserve my sear from Zagreb to Split on the app, so I\u2019d have to buy the ticket separately through the Croatian rail website. \n\nThe main issue is that when I try to reserve my seat from Budapest to Zagreb the only ticket option it gives me is paper with the expected delivery date being 3 days before I\u2019d board my train in Budapest\u2026by this point I won\u2019t be in my home country anymore so I won\u2019t be able to actually have the printed ticket on me. \n\nSo my question is, has anyone else had this issue and did they have trouble getting on their train to Zagreb or was showing the Eurail pass enough? Or would you recommend just using flix bus instead?",

I did the trip solo myself 2 years ago and had a lot of fun!  Enjoy.  I always bough a Pepe rate tickets through each countries rail networks and found it to be way cheaper the the Eurorail pass anyway.\n\n[Mavcsoport Rail](https://www.mavcsoport.hu/en/mav-start/international-travels/night-trip-adriatic-direct-train-connects-budapest-and-split)",

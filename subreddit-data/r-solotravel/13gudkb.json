    "postText": "Hey everyone. I\u2019m (29F) itching to do some long-term solo travel across Latin America and wanted to start with weekend getaways in MX to get comfortable. I don\u2019t speak Spanish but not too concerned with language barrier. I\u2019ve gone to CDMX before but this would be my first time alone in MX. \n\nWhat would you recommend as cities that are good 3-4 day visits for a Black lady on her own in MX?\n\nI\u2019m looking at trips with a budget of $300-$400 USD max, not including flights. I\u2019ve looked into a lot of different cities in MX and many of the popular ones (such as Oaxaca, Guanajuato, Guadalajara) seem best for a week long trip at minimum. It\u2019s been hard to narrow down to a place that fits my budget for just a long weekend but isn\u2019t a small town. I remember feeling flustered to do CDMX in just 3-4 days and want to not feel that way when on this type of getaway! \n\nI like walkable places, being able to just move about freely outdoors and find cool things to do. I don\u2019t necessarily want beach areas, but am open to those. I enjoy stuff like museums and tour spots, but honestly not the main thing I look more in travels. I just want cities that would be easy to see in a few days and have a few stuff to do.  \n\nBased on my research, I\u2019ve been considering Monterrey, but any thoughts would be helpful. Haven\u2019t been able to find enough insight through post searching so any ideas would be great. Thanks!\n\n\nEDIT: thanks for all the recs! Looks like some of the spots I thought needed more days were actually doable. Appreciate it.",

For reference I stayed at a budget hotel and it was around $80 USD a night.\n\nIt's got enough to do to easily spend 3-4 days in.  English isn't spoken as much as some places like Cancun, Tijuana, etc but you shouldn't have trouble.\n\nObviously the food (probably my 3rd favorite food destination city), the various drinks like Tejate and chocolate drinks and obviously mezcal.  Lots of art galleries, lots of cultural exhibits and museums.  Monte Alban is a short 25 minutes away and should be visited.\n\nThe city isn't the most popular for nightlife, it's on the quieter side IMO.\n\nFood is NOT cheap, expect to pay around 12-15$ USD for a main dish at a recommended restaurant.\n\nStreet food is cheap though like my favorite place, Lechon de Oro and the Tlayudas spot south of the Centro square.  \n\nAnd if you are planning to travel to Latin America, you definitely should learn some Spanish, because obviously it will enhance your experience and if you are going into remote places, figure pointing and hand gestures don't always work.",

The hotel zone is a separate entity from Cancun, and that is where all of the party goers and most tourists stay. You could easily stay in the city of Cancun, where you will find plenty to do away from all the clubs and parties. Further, it is extremely safe imo. I have lived in Toronto and a city nearby, and I felt safer walking around at night in Cancun than in Ontario (Ontario and Toronto are quite safe fyi).

    "postText": "I'm looking to try solo travelling for the first time this summer. Never really planned anything like this on my own so just looking for feedback.\n\nKrak\u00f3w 7/16-7/20\n\nI'd be arriving close to midnight on the 16th so would head straight to AirBnB and probably take it easy on 7/17 since I will be tired and jet lagged\n\n7/18 and 7/19 would want to visit Wawel Castle, Auschwitz, Salt Mines, and end with a pub crawl.\n\nFly to Istanbul 7/20-7/24\n\nStaying in a hostel for this part of the trip. Will probably spend a lot of time just walking the city, but definitely want to see Hagia Sophia, Theodosian walls, Basilica Cistern, Grand Bazaar. Open to other suggestions outside of the usual sightseeing.\n\nLeave 7/24",

A hotel might be easier.\n\nI would personally prefer spending a week in either Poland or Turkey, both countries have more than enough to keep you busy and you wouldn't lose a whole day in airports. As it is you only have 2 full days for Istanbul which is really short.",

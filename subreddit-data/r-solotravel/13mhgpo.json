    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI am planning a trip down the Pacific coast from Vancouver, BC to Los Angeles, California. I\u2019m considering going by train one way, possibly detouring to Portland, Oregon and also San Francisco.  Anyone done this trip on Amtrak and have any tips, tricks, or things to avoid?  I\u2019m considering getting a sleeping car. \n\nOnce in LA, I\u2019m primarily interested in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and The Getty.   I\u2019m also looking for budget friendly hotel suggestions which would be close to one or the other.  I understand LA is not good for public transit?  Any advice on getting around would be very welcome too. \n\nthanks!",

            "comment": "Hey I did this last year, stopped in Seattle, Portland, SF and LA. Personally I wasn't a big fan of LA, but I did really enjoy my time in San Fran. Seattle was worth a short stop, Portland not so much in my opinion. As to the train, I was in coach and it was ok, but I felt underwhelmed on the whole as to the comfort and service, and also a couple of cases of quite a delay, but yeah if you're getting a sleeping car that would almost certainly mitigate that. Double check on the food options, the coach offering as to what you could buy was really poor, the worst I've seen on any long distance train really, but if you're getting the dining car then it's probably pretty good from what I heard. There's a British website called \"The man in seat 61\" that provides some good tips on all train travel, though his Amtrak guides could be a little outdated with the changes since COVID so maybe double check things elsewhere.\n\nAs an aside, I did a sleeping berth on the Canadian (Toronto to Vancouver) just before I went down the Pacific coast, and that was one of the greatest experiences of my life, so you could also look into that. Scenery is unparalleled and if you go between October and March (I think), the cheapest sleeping berth gets you access to the park car which is a beautiful place to have a drink and relax during the day/evening.",

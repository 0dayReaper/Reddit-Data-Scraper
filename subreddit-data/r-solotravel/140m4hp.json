    "postText": "I am planning on visiting Europe in late August/Early Sept and like the title says, this will be my first visit to Europe! I live in Toronto, Canada and will be meeting my cousins (from the US) in Paris and their plan is to stay in Europe for 1 week. As I'm not travelling to Paris with them + I'd like to spend more time in Europe, I was planning on going early before meeting up with them. Would love some thoughts on my plan. Feel free to be ruthless and apologize if my plan sounds dumb... like I said, first time traveler. Text in bold are my cousins' plans that I can't change.\n\nToronto -&gt; Zurich (Arrive in the AM, visit the city and museum, sleep at hotel)\n\nZurich -&gt; Grindelwald &amp; Interlaken (Day trip w/ tour guide and then sleep at hotel or sleep on a night train(if that's even possible?)\n\nZurich -&gt; Strasbourg, France (Visit Cath\u00e9drale and explore around La Petite then sleep at hotel)\n\nStrasbourg -&gt; Paris to solo travel (x nights)\n\n**\\*Meet with Cousins in Paris (2 nights) - they've already been here before so they don't need to explore THAT much**\n\n**Paris -&gt; Lyon (1 night) - they are visiting to potentially purchase a Rolex(I think?)**\n\n**Lyon -&gt; Frankfurt (2 nights)**\n\n**Frankfurt -&gt; Munich (2 nights)**\n\n**Munich -&gt; Toronto**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould love some feedback - thanks!",

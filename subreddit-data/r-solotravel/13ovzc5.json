    "postText": "Hello fellow travellers! :) \n\nI hope you\u2019re all well. I\u2019m a 20yo(F) travelling for the first time alone in SE Asia (Vietnam/Cambodia/Laos). I absolutely love the trip and met amazing people on the way! I stay in hostels mainly so I can meet new people and make friends :) \n\nSomething that bothers me however when I book hostels is the amount of time I encountered inappropriate (sexual) behaviour. I was curious about knowing whether this was bad luck, socially accepted or not. \n\nI went to 5 hostels so far. Once, a French couple were having sex in the bed above me. I do speak French as well and I could hear them say \u201cit makes me excited to know they\u2019re hearing us\u201d. They stayed in the dorm the whole day when no one was there but decided to do it when we all came back to sleep. That was the first weird encounter I got aha. \n\nThe other time was when a guy next to me touching himself loudly after I changed inside my pod right after showering. He didn\u2019t seem to be ashamed and I\u2019m convinced he knew I could hear him. Also the bed was shaking. I avoided looking at him the next day. \n\nThe last time is a Dutch couple that did it in the room. We were 2 other girls in the room and I think that she was asleep while they woke me up. \n\nIs this common? In all these cases I just proceeded to put my noise cancelling headphones but I find it a bit weird? In the case of the guy masturbating I was alone and it didn\u2019t make me feel super safe so I left. I\u2019m now dreading to book anything else than female only hostels which is sad because I really enjoy spending time with men travellers :) \n\nAlso I can totally leave for half an hour if a couple wants to get intimate no problem about it I\u2019m quite easy going but with me inside the room I\u2019d like to avoid aha. \n\nFor any other person who encountered these situations what did you do? Also I would like to add that these were not party hostels but \u2018chill hostel\u2019 x) \n\nThanks!",

I'm only 24 but I Def prefer hostels that cater to the 26-40 crowd VS the 18-24 crowd cause of quiet hours being respected, and having a 25 % chance of getting a cold/flu/Covid vs. 75% chance at a party hostel.\n\nI also prefer the vibes at hostels which are more people in the 30s than early 20s",

These only cost about 10% more and the cheap degenerates generally avoid them. Also, compared to a 8 bed dorm, you only have 3 people to deal with. Also, there are less combinations of people to have sex with each other. With 3 people, you only have 3 unique combinations of people, where 2 people end up in the same room who are crazy enough to have sex with other people in it. With 7 people, you have 21 unique combinations. Also, I've noticed 4 bed dorms get booked a lot less because of them being more expensive. Therefore, you might only actually have 1 or 2 roommates.\n\nSo statistically you're better off in high quality hostels with 4 bed dorms.",

I like my roommate, he\u2019s fine. I got to bed at like 9pm due to jet lag. Later around 2:30am I hear the door open and the roommate comes in with a lady we had been introduced to earlier in the day as the bartender for the bar the hostel owner also owned. What still makes me laugh to this day is he closed the curtain on my bunk farther so it was all the way shut. I start to hear them make out and put on my noise cancelling headphones to try to go back to sleep. Due to jet lag, I can\u2019t go back to sleep and then spend the next 2 hours listening to music/podcasts and periodically going to the bathroom, causing them to freeze dramatically in their drunken horny state. I will say if I had been able to find a different bed I would have but I couldn\u2019t find one easily and I was a novice traveler afraid to rock the boat (I def don\u2019t think I\u2019d be chill about it now almost 4 years later).

My best advice, like many others have suggested is noise cancelling headphones or earplugs, if it\u2019s really unbearably loud you could ask them to shut up or they may not even realise others are awake so making the fact that your awake known (coughing, moving around, etc) might encourage them to be quieter.",

Especially on the younger side ones.   \n\n\nAnd on the other side, I can't say I'm proud of  what I did it but what I will say is alcohol is a helluva drug and sometimes that's the only place to go. People gonna bone. Would I have done that sober? Probably not.   \n\n\nNow the dude wildly jerking it, well... not very cool. That sounds uncomfortable. I'm sorry you had to experience that.",

People have sex in dorms, in showers and on the beach all the time. Personally I just ignore it but one time I did go to the check in desk and told the workers that there was a couple having obnoxiously loud sex in the 12-people dormitory right next to my bed, that was in Langkawi island in Malaysia. The workers didn\u2019t do anything though.",

Only places I noticed a lack of this were the lower priced places and the ones that only had male/female dorms.\n\nGetting pissy doesn't help either. I've thrown water on a couple fucking with the curtain half open, waking up the whole room. Ended up arguing for hours and getting barely any sleep regardless, then getting dagger eyes from people for the next two days.\n\nSeriously speaking though, use the showers, or just get a damn private room somewhere like a normal person. It's really shitty behaviour, but its not surprising when a lot of backpackers in SEA are complete bellends.",

The next day, it made for a lot of blushing and the woman tried to test to see if I really did speak German. She got ANGRY at me because I understood her calling out for my girlfriend and I to go in and join them. She COMPLAINED to the lady who rent us the room in the house. She moved us into a really creepy place, alone, for the next week. It sucked. \nYou cannot win. \nThat said, I'd be upset if some guy was jacking off in a room alone with my daughter. She shouldn't be forced into a position where she has to confront someone about it. It seems patently unfair to the female.

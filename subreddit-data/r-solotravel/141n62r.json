    "postText": "In August I will be 1 week in Yaeyama Island (southern/westernmost point of Japan) I will stay in Ishigaki and do day-trips to nearby islands.\nHas anyone ever been there? If so, is doable like going around the island with a bike? Since I\u2019m solo travelling I don\u2019t like to spend a lot of money to rent a car\u2026\nAlso, what are the chances to encounter a Typhoon? It could sound weird but It\u2019s kind of my dream/bucket list (meteorology is one of my passion) to witnessing a Typhoon",

            "comment": "I\u2018ve been on the yaeyamas twice. If you go to Taketomi or Kuroshima you can rent a bike and easily see the whole islands in one day. For Ishigaki or Iriomote you would need a car/motorbike as they are both way too big to do it on a bike. Busses would be another option, they are not that frequent but it\u2018s ok to visit popular places like Kabira bay by bus.\n\nTyphoon season starts in June so it\u2018s not completely unlikely you will encounter at least a tropical storm. I was on Yaeyama once when a Typhoon was passing by, strong winds, lots of rain and my flight was cancelled. Sat inside for 2 days instead of laying at the beach - was kind of a bummer.",

I didn't spend much time on Ishigaki, but spent a night on Taketomi, Kuroshima &amp; Iriomote, and had a fantastic time.  \n\nI rented a bike on both Taketomi &amp; Kuroshima, and explored the entire islands in a day.  Ishigaki has a great public bus system, which is decent for getting around.  Not sure how well it would work by bike, as its not a small island.\n\nIriomote is huge, and you'd need multiple days to bike there.  There is public bus service, but it only runs in the mornings and late afternoons (I guess for people commuting to/from work?), so not that useful for tourism.  \n\nNo clues about typhoons, I was there in February, and the weather was perfect every day.",

Didn't get to visit the interior till the next day\ud83d\ude04. And your travelling in summer so it will be hot and Ishigaki is very humid. If you think you are physically capable of biking Ishigaki go for it otherwise I would be looking into a car or public transport.",

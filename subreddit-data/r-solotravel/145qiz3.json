If you need a visa for that country, they might insist you have it, even though you don't plan to pass immigration.  Lo Cost Carriers often treat every flight as point-to-point and won't take *your* onward plans into consideration when deciding if you meet the entry conditions of where they are flying you to.",

Or if its to the US, you have to go through passport control at your first entry point  (and collect and recheck bags, which is a huge pain when you have those), then it's more complicated and would need enough transit time for that.

Doesn't matter if you're only carrying cabin baggage - both your tickets will be treated as separate journeys. \n\nIf both your airlines have an interline or codeshare agreement, you could speak to them and get a single PNR for a through check-in. It'll also help you in the event of delays or cancellations - the airline will then be compelled to offer you an alternate if your trip is on a single PNR.\n\nEDIT - A lot of argument about this in the follow ups, so let me clarify. I meant to say that you may possibly pass through a security check (bag and body scan only) between your arrival and departure gates, and did not mean to say that you will need to necessarily exit the terminal itself - that will depend on which airport you are using, as some have an airside transfer channel while others do not. As per other commenters, security checks might not be required at all at some airports they have frequently used. It\u2019ll be helpful if the OP can either tell us which airport they are transiting through, or just check with the airport directly. Cheers.",

There is a security protocol between the arrivals and departures gates. It's quite common across Asia, for that matter. Hence the advice.\n\nAs for why, its to rule out the carriage of any contraband items on to airplanes. OP may buy a bottle of alcohol and have half of it at airport 1, or they may buy cigarettes and a lighter, or a swiss knife or whatever. Airport 2 will have no way of knowing if OP is carrying an opened bottle of flammable liquid, an ignitor, or a sharp weapon onboard flight 2 without doing a security check during sterile transit. Its a security loophole waiting to be exploited otherwise. Most airports will not like to limit what they can sell - its a money spinner - so its just easier to enhance security instead.",

Directly transiting is possible and you'd only have to scan your bag once before the gate. Everything is still in the secured area. People are telling OP to clear immigration, leave, and clear immigration again, reenter. That's not necessary if everything is in the same terminal (many times depending on the airport different terminals are still inside the secured area, so you don't need to go through immigration and leave the secured area even. But airports like KLIA1&amp;2 definitely do require leaving to transit cross-terminals)",

    "postText": "Hi, I am going for my first solotravel adventure with my bike from Germany to Switzerland / Italy. I am 20 years old. (M).\n\nI don't want to go that deep down (and drive so long, its also my first long trip with my motorcycle) therefore I stay on the North Side of Italy.\n\nThings I generally would do on all stops: Hiking, exploring City, eating good Food, Biking (Motorcycle)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy 9 Day Itinerary:\n\n* **Start HOME (Frankfurt)**\n   * 7 Hours Drive\n* **Swiss Alps** \\- 2 Days (Camping place with rented Shelter, going Hiking, Biking)\n   * 4 Hours Drive\n* **Milano** \\- 3 Days (maybe swapping with Turin and do a one day trip to Milano?)\n   * 2,5 Hours Drive\n* **Lake Garda** \\- 2 Day\n   * 3,5 Hours Drive\n* **Venice** \\- 2 Days\n   * 6 Hours Drive\n* **Innsbruck** \\- 1 Day\n   * *6 Hours Drive*\n* ***Back Home***",

            "comment": "Seems fine but I don't understand why you'd want to spend 3 days in Milan. I get the city exploring side but you could city hop Frankfurt-Milan any time you want, easily (and also personally, I'd skip riding in really big places with loads of traffic, but that's me). Instead, you have the unique chance to get to harder to visit places with your bike, I'd focus on that if I were you.\n\nTo get down south, I wouldn't take the quickest route, but have fun around the mountain passes. That could add a couple of hours to your itinerary, but unsurpassed sights and feels. I'd then border Lake Como for a bit as you make your way eastwards, and skip Milan altogether if it were me.\n\nNot sure how you're planning to navigate, but for instance on my TomTom (which is a bikers version) I can select the amount of \"fun\" I wan to have (twisties, secondary roads, ...) when plotting the route. You might want to look into something like that.",

            "comment": "Sounds like a pretty good time.  If you haven't already done so, buy a good map and highlight the best riding roads that you want to go on.  Mark these in one colour.  Then mark out the likely route to join these in another colour.  There are some great roads to ride/drive on in the Swiss and Austrian Alps. You are probably already across these (if you aren't, then use a bit of Google-fu to find the best roads), but the Stelvio Pass and the Furka Pass are just awesome places to be. From Venice to Innsbruck you will want to go through the Glossglockner High Alpine Pass - pure bliss!  Google Maps is great for directions and use during the day, but having a good paper map to plan things out or to visualise your options is really helpful.\n\nIf you love motorbikes, the Ducati factory and museum is in Bologna and for Moto Guzzi is learn Lake Como, not to far from the places you list.  Check and see if these have factory tours there.  Ferrari, Lamborghini and Pagani are also around Modena, if that is your thing. Good luck and enjoy.",

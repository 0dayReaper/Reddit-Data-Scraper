    "postText": "Map of my trip plan: [https://imgur.com/BI3KWfO](https://imgur.com/BI3KWfO)\n\nPlease refer to the map above. I am planning this trip to be somewhere between 2 and 3 months. I will be departing the US in probably August 20th, give or take a week or two. I will not have a job at this time. (For reference I am a white guy in my mid twenties who is fluent in English and Spanish and nothing else). (Also for reference, I've been solo travelling /r/digitalnomad gang for the last two years so I am not new to solo travel or travel in general, especially \"long form\" travel of 1-3 months at a time. This will just be my first time not employed while I do so.)\n\nI did the math on expenses (flight, hostel stays, food, drinks, train tickets, bus tickets), and arrived at a very liberal $4600 USD. I will be starting this trip with maybe $30k in checking, not that I intend to use even half of that.\n\nI am most interested in hearing if you think Mount Olympus as this time, around late october, early November, is worth doing. The hostels and shelters may be closed or not serving food.\n\nRoute:\n\n* Day 01: Fly into Tirana, spend 1 day here\n* Day 02: Bus to Theth, begin Peaks of the Balkans Hike (must do!) (12-13 days)\n* Day 15: Bus to Kotor, Montenegro, enjoy the beach (1 or 2 days)\n* Day 17: Bus to Dubrovnik, Croatia, enjoy the city (1 or 3 days)\n* Day 19: Ferry to Split\n* Day 20: Train to Zagreb, enjoy the city (1-2 days)\n* Day 22: Train to Ljubjana, enjoy the city (1-2 days)\n* Day 24: Complete HALF (1/2) of the Juliana Alps Mountain Trail (10 days)\n* Day 34: take bus from Bled, Slovenia back to Ljublana, get back on train to Zagreb\n* Day 35: Take train + private car + train to Sarajevo, (2 days here)\n* Day 37: Take train + bus to Bar, Montenegro\n* Day 38: Take Belgrade-Bar Train (must do!) from Bar to Belgrade (11+ hours)\n* Day 39: Enjoy Belgrade (2 days here)\n* Day 40: Take train to Novi Sad (1-2 days here)\n* Day 41: Take train back to Belgrade and then to Nis (spend 1 day here)\n* Day 42: Take bus to Skopje, North Macedonia, sleep (1 day here)\n* Day 43: Take train + bus to Thessaloniki, Greece, enjoy the city (1 day)\n* Day 44: Take train to Litochoro, Greece, and spend 1 day here preparing to hike Mount Olympus\n* Day 45: Hike Mount Olympus (2 days)\n* Day 47: Sleep in Litochoro again, prepare for train tomorrow\n* Day 48: Take train to Meteora, spend an overnight here\n* Day 50: Take train to Athens (4 days here)\n* Day 54: Fly to Sofia Bulgaria, spend 2 days here\n* Day 56: Take bus to Rila Monastery, spend night around here\n* Day 57: take train to Plovdiv, spend 2-3 days here\n* Day 60: Take 12 hr train from Plovdiv to Bucharest\n* Day 61: Some recovery days in Bucharest, and sight seeing (3-4 days)\n* Day 62: Take train to Constanta for a day trip\n* Day 65: Begin 12-day Transylvanian Train Tour (12 days)\n* Day 77: Return to Bucharest, fly home to the USA\n\nIn terms of returning to normal life, I am pretty well equipped, resume-wise, and am not worried about this aspect.\n\nIs this a solid plan? Is my cash estimate very wrong?\n\nAre there any very important cities or places that I should hit? My biggest constraint, I believe, it my trip butting up against the winter season. Is that correct?\n\nHave any of you ever skipped an important family holiday like Thanksgiving before?",

You'll need some days to do laundry, relax, etc. When travelling for 3 months, you might also get sick, tired, etc.\nIf I were you I would have less cities/more nights in each stop, have a less \"strict\" schedule and leave more openings for spontaneity or whatever might happen.",

I also loved Tirana and heard sooo many good things about the rest of the country. \n\nThere is so much to see and do in this region.

That said, here some notes:\n\n**Day 01: Fly into Tirana, spend 1 day here**\n\nTirana deserves more than 1 day. At least do a free walking tour and a museum. There are a lot of interesting things to learn about their recent history and culture. If you go to Albania and haven't learned anything, you haven't really been to Albania.\n\n**Day 15: Bus to Kotor, Montenegro, enjoy the beach (1 or 2 days)**\n\nKotor doesn't really have a beach. There is one at a 20 - 30 min drive. You can lounge at the waterside though, a bit further ahead there are a lot of restaurants.\n\n**Day 17: Bus to Dubrovnik, Croatia, enjoy the city (1 or 3 days)**\n\nCan be done in 1 day in my opinion. Looks nice, but it's small and very crowded with tourists.\n\n**Day 37: Take train + bus to Bar, Montenegro**\n\nBar is average at best, but there used to be a really good hostel in Old bar. Might still be there.\n\n**Day 43: Take train + bus to Thessaloniki, Greece, enjoy the city (1 day**)\n\nIf you can, just skip this. There pretty much nothing to see or do in this city.\n\n**Day 48: Take train to Meteora, spend an overnight here**\n\nYou seem to like hiking, so it will be worth staying 2 or 3 days. The monasteries are beautiful on the uniquely shaped rocks. You can do a few hikes from the bottom to the top and find some more hidden locations. You can also hike around the backside.",

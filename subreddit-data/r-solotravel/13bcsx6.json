I literally walked to this party hostel, taking massive dumps all the way there cause I ate something fkd or my gut fauna was \"aclimating\" lols.  Like must of been 10+ shits in random buisnesses otw.  Decided to drown the gut bacteria in booze... that worked ROFL.  Actually tbh I went to a pharmacy and told them what was going on, dude gave me some pills, tried to tip and he was aghast cause I guess they are legit professionals and dont take tips.  Anyways, I get to this party hostel - walk in there like I own the place without giving a single glance to the front desk staff. Just didnt want them to call me out, not in a rude way tho! I cracked a joke about awesome vacations as I walked by.   Go into this part... people from Bazil, Scotland, England, Rome, Norway, China,  all having a massive beer bong competition.   So im a beef fed albertan im like... lets gooo - Scotland and Canada made it to the finals naturally rofl.   Anyways these people just adopted me like I was there the entire time and we went clubbing and had a GREAT night.   Its super easy just be kind and safe, with a bit of humor and your set.",

For future travels, I don't know how you spent the 16 hours, but nowadays there's a super fast train connection to central Helsinki directly from the airport. I'd highly recommend spending the layover there if your Visa/passport allows. It's a small city. While you may not be able to get a proper feel of the city in that time, you can pretty easily squeeze in all the coolest attractions.",

I flew there, spent most of the afternoon exploring, stayed overnight, then caught the ferry to Tallinn the next day.\n\nI am guilty of being a lame country counter so I will count Finland, but I know I've barely scratched the surface.

Thanks to this corona stuff I'm planning on spending 3-4 weeks in August/September hiking around Lapland, learning more about the sami culture, fishing and camping. I've actually been so excited about it lately that I was in fact happy that my plans to go work in Lisbon for few months shit the bed. \n\nTallinn is pretty awesome place too! Much better for your wallet as well. Hope you find some more time to explore around here in the future! Regarding the solo travel stuff, Finland has this thing called \"everyman's rights\" or something along those lines, which means basically that you're allowed to go camping pretty much anywhere, can do some basic fishing, put up a fire if it hasn't been too dry (which is rare), collect berries and mushrooms etc without paying anything. So in a way you can do travels here very cheaply too. And our supermarkets are easily the highest quality on average I've been to anywhere in the world, so getting food from those is going to save a lot compared to eating out.",

I have some pretty simple requirements for this: leave the airport, visit a supermarket or wherever the locals buy food, eat at least 1 traditional food, and see a main attraction.

I think on average 75% of my nights traveling include some form of nightlife and 90% of my days includes doing something fun and new. This only works if you are not doing long term travel (since I sleep on average 4 hours a night) or if you need your sleep. But for my (short) solo trips it's working out good. :) \n\nAlso, this isn't me trying to be judgemental to others who don't feel the need to party of course.  I enjoy it and therefore I think it's fun and exciting to go in new cities.",

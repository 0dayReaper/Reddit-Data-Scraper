    "postText": "I'm setting off on a solo workaway/helpx trip in August (just going to go until I get tired or run out of money). I spend a lot of time making music at home and I think I would be very sad if I weren't able to while traveling.\n\nI'm willing to consider giving up some pieces of gear but right now these are the things I'm considering:\n\n\\- laptop- mini midi keyboard- baby Taylor guitar- zoom h1n mic\n\nI'm a guitarist but I've also considered leaving my baby Taylor behind and picking up something cheap when I get there.\n\nI think I'm pretty set on bringing at least my laptop and midi keyboard but I'd love to hear anyone's experience bringing gear and recording while traveling. Did you use it less than you thought? Did you love having it?\n\nFor reference I plan on staying with hosts for longer periods of time (3 weeks - 1.5 months thereabouts). If I were planning on being super transient I wouldn't bother. I've done this kind of thing before but not with all this gear. A bit nervous about carrying all that $$ around but I know how much fun I could have with it and how badly I want to share musical experiences with people while traveling.\n\nAm I crazy to want to bring this shit? Anyone done anything similar?",

Decided it wouldn't be a vacation without it, and I'm willing to spend the money required to bring it with me.\n\nI had it for a 3-week trip in Greece last summer, and it wasn't much of a hassle. I was definitely happy I brought it along :)",

Traveling by car while in the US so it's a little easier with the gear. Internationally I may ditch the midi controller if space becomes a problem but I'm planning on everything fitting. I travel pretty minimally otherwise which allows me to fit more gear!\n\nOther than the controller the bulkiest thing is the headphones. They're not foldable and I have a little hard case to protect them, which is an awkward size. But it's a compromise since I want those for being able to mix tracks with reasonable confidence while traveling.\n\nI say bring the gear if you know you'll use it! With long-term travel I'm not out exploring every day. So on stay-in days or evenings I'm usually working on the computer. I bring the minimum I would use at home. The midi controller is easiest for me to ditch. Everything else is pretty important to my workflow.\n\nGood luck!",

I've been waffling between bringing my Sony MDR's which fold but don't give me as even a sound, or my 6XX's which are bulky as hell. What size bag are you planning on bringing on your international travel?\n\nEdit: holy shit I just saw you're active in the B-town subreddit! I graduated from IU Bloomington in 2020.",

I travel with an Osprey hiking bag as my main bag. It is 40-ish L and fits in the overhead bin of planes. I have a smaller pack-able REI bag as a personal item that I use to put in my laptop, etc. when flying. And worst case, if I had to gate check my bigger bag I can throw my Zoom and other tech stuff in that REI bag.   \n\n\nThe hiking bag isn't the greatest for organization. It's a top-loader with a side zip access. Packing cubes help. Laptop is in a protective sleeve and I have little cases for the controller, interface, and headphones. It works well enough. I traveled with a similar setup before and it was fine, except I didn't have the midi controller or the bulky headphone case then. And I had a little satchel, messenger bag thing from an army surplus store that I could wear with my main pack. I might need to revisit that setup!",

So I usually carry quite some gear as well. A laptop, camera with one lens mounted + an extra one, a drone, tripod, external hard drive and lots of other smaller assets like cables, a little microphone, cleaning kit for lenses and stuff. And last time it all fitted in just carry on luggage. So it should definitely be possible. Not sure about the guitar though as I've got no idea how big that one is. But if it's a laptop and a small midi keyboard, yeah go for it!",

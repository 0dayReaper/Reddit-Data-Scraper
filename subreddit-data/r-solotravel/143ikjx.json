    "postText": "I'm looking to do a workaway in Colombia for three weeks and am in particular looking to BOTH engage in nature and go out at night to party.\n\nMinca seems gorgeous and if I don't end up doing a workaway there I plan to visit for a few days, but it seems like the town itself is very sleepy with no opportunity to dance/drink/party, which is fine for a short time but I worry I'd get bored spending three weeks there.\n\nCali seems cool for the opportunity to salsa dance, though I'd like to engage in other forms of dance (like just casual at a club) on at least some nights. Bigger problem is there doesn't seem to be much in the way of nature or really anything else to do besides salsa. I'm not very into history or infrastructure. I worry I'll also get bored here.\n\nWhich city should I spend three weeks in? Any recommendations for what to do in either while I'm there is welcome as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It's dangerous tho. \n\nCali is nice, but dangerous. Nature is not as rich as in Minca. It's hot, humid and full of mosquitos.",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI just spontaneously booked a plane ticket to Athens and land the 18th (~2pm) and depart the 28th (~9pm). This means I have 10 total nights.\n\nMy budget for stays every night is to stay below $60/night. Thing I am interested in are definitely seeing some of the historic sights in Athens, partying, seeing beautiful beaches/snorkeling and also meeting new people. I am big on photography so I love good photo ops and also do not mind the hot or cold weather so I am really open to anything.\n\nMy question is, since I am going in mid-late oct I know this is technically the off season and I know some hostels/restaurants/clubs/bars are definitely going to be closed, I have read mixed things from google and other websites on going around the time that I am, I just couldn't pass up the flight being this cheap all the way from the east coast. Is there anything that I am missing about going in this se\nSo far my plans are:\n\n-Definitely stay at a hostel in Athens for the first 2-3 nights such as \"Athens Backpackers\"\n\n-Go to Paros and spend 2-3 nights there. (by the looks of it now for the dates id stay there are not many options on hostelworld)\n\n-Go to either Santorini, Crete or Mykonos.\n\nLet me know any recs for this specific time period. Also this is my first solo trip so wish me luck, thanks!",

I doubt you will starve on any island, but the number of dining options may get thin. It may make sense to start with islands, and work towards Athens",

    "postText": "Hello travel friends, I am visiting Bali on a school trip this summer, then flying to Cairns, Australia, because it is cheap from Bali and Australia sounds amazing. I will be in school FT, needing to be on Wi-Fi as I travel, but not needing to be connected everyday (school about 20 hours per week, with some deadlines, but mostly flexible timelines). I plan to travel from Cairns down to Melbourne and possibly Adelaide by public transportation, bus or train. \n\nI'm thinking of Townsville as my fist stop south of Cairns, then maybe Airlie Beach, Noosa, Brisbane, somewhere ?? then of course seeing Sydney. Open to suggestions of places to stop that are beautiful, culturally interesting, and easy to get around on foot or by public transportation. Also, suggestions for cheaper beach towns where I can stay a few days to get caught up on my school work.\n\nAlso any recommendations for great vegan restaurants welcomed. Thank you!",

But apart from that, it\u2019s basically a mix between the UK and the US. \n\nAs an Aussie, not sure how interesting Townsville will be.  But it will be bloody humid (as will cairns) so prepare yourself. I don\u2019t know how long you have, but you have listed a few places that will be pretty similar ie beachy resorts. Not sure you need to visit them all?",

I live in the desert of California now and it's sooooo dry. I hear you about places having a similar vibe. I will do some more research. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Assuming you mean the Australian Summer, then Cairns really isn't a great place to be - it is very hot and very humid.  Daytime temperatures are just too hot to enjoy and you can't swim in the ocean due to stingers (jellyfish).\n\nIt is a longggg way from Cairns to Melbourne, so take that in to consideration (you don't actually say how long you plan on being in Australia or exactly what you are wanting to see and do, specifically).  You can get cheap flights to any Australian capital city, not just Cairns.  I would recommend trying to narrow down what you want to see and where you would like to stay and come up with a rough plan on how much it will cost.  You could easily spend a week in and around Noosa (Sunshine Coast), but it may be more expensive that you imagine.  If you are starting in January and planning on staying for a couple of months, consider flying to Melbourne and starting in the south and working your way north and ending in Cairns in March.",

I will be flying to Cairns on August 24, which I understand is fall/the shoulder season, which seems like a good time to be in Australia. It also seems like I will be traveling in the direction (north from Cairns to Melbourne in the south) following the season as it gets warmer down south. :-)\n\nI am not sure what I want to see, just daily life in Australia and some natural beauty. I love to walk on the beach, but also to walk around new cities. I like art and I love a good vegan meal, but honestly, just seeing a new place and what comes of meeting the locals is fun for me, especially after not traveling for years because of Covid. I hear you about the cost and I will price it out a bit more after I sketch out an itinerary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

I would recommend spending as much time in Queensland as you can as the weather will be great in September and you will notice it getting cooler as you head south of Brisbane.  Check out Magnetic Island and Airlie Beach/Whitsundays for some more laid back places.",

Closer to the CBD is a place called Grassfed who do amazing burgers in South Brisbane (though they are closing sometime this year and I'm not sure what you mean by summer, summer in Europe is Winter for us). \n\nThere is an awesome arcade bar called Netherworld in the city centre (Fortitude Valley) that has cool retro games, interesting drinks and all of their food is vegan by default - costs extra if you want a dairy/meat substitute. \n\nWe have heaps of vegan options in Brisbane, though. I still haven't tried everything yet \ud83d\ude05",

If you're American, it's like Maine to Miami. Def do like, a bus or road trip from Cairns to a few places north you really want to hit and then fly down.",

I am American and yes I saw that Australia is the size of the continental USA. It looks smaller on world maps. I hear you about flying, and it may be really pretty to fly over the outback, still hoping to go slow and take busses and trains. I would walk if I had more time :-)",

Do some snorkeling in cairns and some surfing down south. Learn about the aboriginal cultures because that is something truly unique about Australia. Sydney is pretty but a bit soulless and Melbourne is not as nice as Sydney but has a way better arts scene.",

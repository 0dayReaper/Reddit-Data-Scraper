I guess I\u2019m worried if I\u2019m wallowing",

I love outdoor experiences of all different kinds, so when I got back from a trip through central America, all I could think about was traveling - making plans for little day or multi-day trips close to home doing things I know I love was the only way I could stay sane while settling back in to \"normal life\" at home. It took a solid month for me to get out of the post-travel funk and into this new mindset where I started enjoying work again and doing these outdoor things (and embracing the new person I had become from travel). \nTLDR - the funk is real, plan easy fun stuff close to home and you'll realize normal life can be more interesting than it used to be.",

In my case I really couldn\u2019t deny all the things I did, so I\u2019m trying to cultivate that person again, with the extra challenge of your old environment asking a lot of you. Things like joining a climbing gym or planning multi-day treks because I loved how outdoorsy I was, or signing up for a motorcycle course because I loved being on motorbike all over Asia. Nobody else needs to recognize it for you to not feel all the changes you\u2019ve gone through, but I do empathize on the loneliness of it when you can\u2019t easily share. This is where meeting people who travel like you did is invaluable",

The authentic experiences of traveling the world on more than a 1 or 2 week vacation each year are absolutely priceless! We are currently in South Africa for a few months. We will probably leave in 2-3 weeks and head to Thailand to house hunt for a month or so. Our goal is to obtain affordable housing in numerous countries where we can easily go when we desire that location and rent them out when we are off to other distant lands. So again, I say **GO FOR IT!!!**",

He had all the typical man toys, but rarely got to use them. Boat, multiple motorcycles, cars, SUV's, all sorts of sporting equipment, man cave with all the typical things, etc. But he ultimately decided he wanted the freedom to work from home and travel the world, so he started his own business and within 6 months, he was matching his previous salary and beyond. But he was now free from being stuck in an office and ran everything from where ever he was in the world. He just needed his laptop, cellphone and internet access. His employees back in the U.S. took care of everything. He ended up selling all the material things and went on a travel binge for several years where he went and stayed in a different country every month. When he started looking for land in my home country, someone referred him to me. I told him I'd be willing to help with his land search, but he had to pay me for my services by bringing me my favorite peppermint from my country (I lived in NY at the time). He found the land he wanted and made good on his payment promise of bringing me candy from my home country. He flew to NY to bring it to me. We went to dinner several times over the next few days and talked on the phone for 8-10 hours a day over the next week after he left. The next weekend, he came back and we repeated this weekend dating for several months until I was sure I wanted to join his journey. That was years ago and we've been on the travel journey together ever since. The biggest thing was getting rid of his/our expenses in the U.S. What the cost of living in the U.S. was costing us, we could live in other countries for pennies on the dollar. When he shares his story, he often tells people how his cost of living in Miami at that time was over $6000 a month for everything. When he left the country, he moved into a fully furnished, 2-bedoom condo on 1 of the most beautiful beaches in the Caribbean and his total cost of living was only $1200 for all expenses. So moving abroad actually reduced our cost of living and provided more resources to travel from country to country. And even together, we still live very comfortable and spend less that $2000 most months. We run our businesses from home and actually have more money to travel now, because even with flights in between, the cost of living is always cheaper where ever we go than it would cost us to live in the U.S. Especially in places like New York and Miami where we were.",

I have decided I just do not want to live in the US anymore and that is totally okay! I am very grateful to have started a new remote tech job and am planning my exit from this place. In the meantime, I booked a 3 week holiday from work to Hong Kong and Taiwan to look forward to in the Fall! I highly recommend you start planning something at the very least! Working US hours from Asia although it will suck ass sure beats living in this country. Hate to tell you instead of getting better as time goes on for me it is getting worse lol",

My pup who I had since I was a child and moved into my apartment with me 3 years ago passed away last year but he was a big boy and still made it to almost 14. It was the worst lose I ever dealt with in my family and I cried even more about him than anyone else in my family (sorry Grandma lol) it just hit different...\n\nFor now, I have nothing tying me down to the US long term more than a yearly apartment contract. Sold my car, not getting a new dog, etc. May be harder for you to do the whole Digital Nomad thing, but if you were to be an expat somewhere, totally doable to bring your pup!",

It was only 5 days but the post-travel blues is so bad. it\u2019s the fourth day now and still there. Can\u2019t work eat or do anything. \nMaybe because I met some awesome people this time and I will never see them again. \nSo it depends on the trip and not only the time you spent travelling.",

I\u2019m now in a different position with a different company. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to pinpoint because I had Covid right before my trip too. So I could never figure out if it was the new job, long Covid, or just the travel blues.\n\nI\u2019m much happier in my new job, but the few months I stayed in my previous position really worked on my mental. Time heals all though.",

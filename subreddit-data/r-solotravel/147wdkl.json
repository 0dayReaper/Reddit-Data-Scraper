    "postText": "Taking my first multi-stop solo trip this summer and I plan on taking a sleeper train. I just checked the times and saw that my train leaves at 23:30-ish from Munich central. I\u2019ve never been to Munich or the train station so I\u2019m a bit nervous getting there/waiting that late at night as a solo female traveler. I\u2019m wondering about the general safety of waiting that late at night or if there is some equivalent of like an airline lounge type situation that I could pay to wait in. For reference I\u2019m from New York and have spent many late nights catching trains at ny penn, I guess I\u2019m just looking for some reassurance from those who have traveled in Munich specifically that late at night. Thanks!!",

I don\u2019t remember exactly what time I got back from my day trip to Salzburg but it was later in the evening and dark and I passed through the station many times throughout as well. Never once felt unsafe as a solo female (35). Obviously stay alert. I also remember seeing a good amount of police scattered throughout.",

Just take the usual precautions plus I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a police presence so you\u2019ll be fine. Safety and the beer are my two favorite things about Germany! :D\n\nEdit: passed through Hauptbahnhof a couple times and there\u2019s the usual sketchy people, but just ignore and you\u2019ll be fine. Nothing compared to the US!! I\u2019m from Chicago, I know. lol",

Waiting with the rest of the crowd at the station is probably safer than trying to find somewhere secluded to avoid them - there are always other vacationers / solo travelers riding trains at the same odd hours you are. Often times restaurants like McDonalds will be open late nearby as well. Granted I\u2019m an American guy in my 30s but I\u2019d often see young women traveling alone on the trains there, which tends to be my barometer for how safe a place is. I\u2019d say the train stations and European cities in general feel less sketchy than most cities in the US.",

The worst thing that might happen is probably someone pickpocketing. But the much more common occurrence are beggars asking for money.\n\nPersonally, I've never had an issue. My worst experience in where some drunk people yelling at me. But ignoring them usually works fine.\n\nSome of my female friends had more or less creepy strangers talking to them, but not very often and they usually just walked away when they showed no interest.\n\nIn summary, you should be fine, just watch your pockets.",

I'm an older guy fully bearded, and I darken the doorway.. I remember when I was in Rome everybody warned me about the Roman train station, the pickpockets the problems etc, really in the whole city.. I never experienced anything and I was out at 4:00 a.m. wandering as I do everywhere. Same in Berlin in so-called unsavory neighborhoods and nice places but knock on wood I've never had an issue\n\nMunich would not even be on my radar. But then again these days who are potential crazies everywhere who knows but I don't think it's anything you have to worry about other than always having your New York edge with you",

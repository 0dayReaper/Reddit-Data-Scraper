    "postText": "Hey everyone! I was planning my first solo trip and Budapest was one of the places I was gonna visit. I was planning to visit between 8th-13th of August but just found out that it overlaps with Sziget.\n\nI don\u2019t plan on going to Sziget but since I\u2019m travelling solo and staying at a hostel, I did definitely had hoped to meet as many other travellers as possible and also go out to experience the ruin bars and nightlife.\n\nI\u2019m worried that during Sziget, the general nightlife of Budapest that includes regular bars and clubs will not be as popular. I found a couple other posts of people asking the same question but there were no clear answers. Can anyone share their experiences in Budapest during Sziget, especially people who didn\u2019t attend the festival while they were there? Thanks!",

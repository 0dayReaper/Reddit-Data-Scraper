    "postText": "Greetings fellow solo travellers!\n\nSo I have a 4 day trip booked to Chile as the title suggests and was hoping for some advice as to what the best use of my time would be. I tried searching the sub for pointers but unfortunately didn't come across a situation that had quite the same parameters as mine. \n\nBased on my preliminary browsing I figured I could do either one of two things:\n1) Valparaiso/Santiago with a Maipo/Casablanca wine tour included at some point\n\n2) San Pedro de Atacama\n\nIf anyone has any advice/input/suggestions all are greatly appreciated and welcomed.\n\nThank you all in advance!\n\nIf it helps, I will be flying into Santiago at 6am on a Saturday from NYC and my flight back is at 10:30pm on a Tuesday night. Travel will be last weekend of May.",

            "comment": "I would just shoot for Valpo then, it\u2019s a pretty cool port city and only takes like 2 hours to get there by bus from Santiago. Otherwise you don\u2019t really have time to go much place else. Do a free walking tour to check out the street art and maybe meet some people to do something that weekend. That\u2019s my two cents, Santiago is nothing spectacular but it\u2019s a big city so you can find things to do there as well",

Also in Santiago La Chimba hostel is nice with a big social vibe, there will be partying but the dorm rooms are pretty separate from the party areas",

Just another quick question if you don't mind, would you happen to know if Maki hostel organizes tours through the hostel itself or I am better off looking for things on my own? Just local things like a walking tour or visiting dunas de concon?",

I think it starts at like 10:00 am or something. But the hostel should know. And to get to concon (in vi\u00f1a) you just need to use the public busses (these get pretty wild just fyi lol), but you can also Uber though that\u2019s more expensive and not as fun. I would ask your guide from the walking tour about other things to do!",

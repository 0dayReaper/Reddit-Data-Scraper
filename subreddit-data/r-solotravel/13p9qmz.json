    "postText": "Just got out of a pretty funky situation in Prague.\n\nIt was about 2 am when I (23 M) decided to head in for the night after drinking pretty heavily. I initially was going to walk the 20 minutes back to my apartment until a taxi asked if I needed a ride. In hind sight, I should have obviously ignored this request- but due to my intoxicated nature, I obliged.\n\nThe conversation was pretty casual at first. He asked where I was from, how long I had been in Prague, and if I liked it here. About 2 minutes go by, and he asks me if I can pay cash. Again, I should have known better and confirmed the rate before entering the taxi. However, I decide to go to the ATM and exchange 3000 Czech Koruna from my Canadian bank- about $220 CAD.\n\nBy the time we arrive at the destination (a 10 minute taxi ride), he asks for 3000 Czech Koruna in payment. Although I\u2019m still pretty intoxicated, I know this price is complete bull shit. \u201cI\u2019m not paying you that price, brother \u201c I tell him, knowing it would essentially be 150 euros if I did. He tries to persuade me that this is the price of the taxi, and it\u2019s \u201cthe normal rate in Prague\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m starting to feel increasingly uncomfortable in his car. The doors are locked and I have no way of opening them. I\u2019m not sure what to do exactly, as I\u2019ve never been in this situation. I tell him in sternest that I\u2019ll not be paying him the price he asked for, and that the most I\u2019m willing to give is 2000 Koruna. In addition, I promise that if I ever need a taxi I would give him a call (not true, obviously). While this is still an exorbitant amount, I\u2019m essentially pulling all the strings I can to get out of this situation.\n\nHe offers to give me 800 Koruna in exchange for the 2000, bringing the total down to 1200Kc or about 50 euros. I\u2019m not sure how I managed to pull it off, but I essentially tell him that the most I\u2019m willing to give him is the 100 Czech Korunas I have of the 2100 I was given at the ATM. I tell him to unlock the doors, to which he obliges. Infuriated, he begins to curse at me and tells me that the amount I\u2019m trying to give him is robbery; pretty ironic if you ask me.\n\nAfter 5 endless minutes of back and forth bantering, I convinced him to take the 100Kc. I\u2019m pretty sure I either lost (I.e conversion fee) or forgot 900Kc in the ATM, but I\u2019m just happy to be alive and home safe.\n\nTo conclude this long winded lesson when solo travelling- NEVER feel compelled to enter a taxi when you\u2019re not comfortable. Make sure you confirm the price beforehand, and if they only have a card machine, make sure they actually have one.\n\nI know my experience seems like an avoidable one, but I\u2019m honestly just lucky to have gotten out of that situation with my life and the majority of my money.",

            "comment": "Dude the real lesson is to never enter a random taxi while drunk, pretty much every country has some kind of taxi app: Uber, Grab, GoJek, Indrive, Yandex etc. What happened to you is an unpleasant but common taxi experience that happens to everyone at least once because a lot of taxi drivers are scammers at heart. Asking for the price beforehand doesn\u2019t always solve the issue because they will come up with excuses like \u201cwe had to take a different route\u201d, \u201cit took longer than expected\u201d, \u201cI thought you meant a different address that is closer\u201d etc.\n\n\nBut it\u2019s really not about money. Money is just paper. It\u2019s about your safety. It\u2019s not safe to get into a random taxi car while being intoxicated. It\u2019s very very dangerous.",

But you only got scammed out of a bit of cash, it\u2019s not a big deal. Some 15 years ago my dad got into a taxi off the street while being drunk, the driver picked another dude on the street a couple of minutes later, together they drove my dad 30 km out of the city into the forest, robbed him, beat the shit out of him and left him in the forest bleeding out of his face. \n\nStay safe! And don\u2019t be too angry at yourself.",

I truly hope he made a full recovery. \n\nI will say I am most definitely frustrated with myself. It\u2019s hard not to look back in hindsight and realize my absolute lack of social awareness in that situation. The only slack I can give myself is that this is my first time solo travelling in Europe. It\u2019s only realistic to assume I will make errors in judgement as I navigate the world on my own. \n\nIn saying that, I really do appreciate you offering some perspective on this. I think after a couple of days I should be over this mental obstacle and make smarter decisions going forward. :)",

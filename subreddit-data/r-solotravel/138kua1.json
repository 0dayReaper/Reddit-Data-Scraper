    "postText": "Hi all - have really enjoyed reading posts on this subreddit, was hoping to get some tips here regarding my upcoming tips in 2 weeks.\n\nI will be in Italy for 11 days - flying into Venice and out of Rome. The plan currently is to split the trip into: 5 days Rome, 4 days Florence, 2 days Venice. This would include day trips from Rome (Ostia Antica/Pompeii, Sorrento) and Florence (Cinque Terre, maybe 1.5+ days?). \n\nDoes this feel like a good split? What I enjoy - history, food, city walks. What I do not care one bit about - art. History museums yay, art museums nay (yes I realize I'm missing out on Italy's greatest offering but it's fine). I also had a recent leg injury, and while it's almost healed, I still plan to avoid hiking for now (walking around cities is cool)\n\nI also would like to watch Fiorentina and/or Roma play when I'm in Florence/Rome (they have home games those days). Is it safe for tourists? Any suggestions here?\n\nAny general tips about travelling solo in Italy (35M) would be super welcome and appreciated as well!",

Just stay in Rome, there's a lifetime+ worth of things to do and see.\n\nDon't forget that every time you change locations you're eating up at least a half a day, not counting the time it takes to check in/out, pack/unpack, etc. Your two days in Venice might be more like 1.5 since you'll probably be checking out at 10-11am and getting to the train station.  Go easy on the day trips or you won't see much of the actual place you're staying.",

Second day, took the boat to Positano and the bus to Sorrento, only spending one night there before taking the boat back to Naples. I'd do either Rome and Naples/Amalfi or Rome and Florence, if you're set on starting in Venice. 2 days in Venice is a solid plan - that said having spent a weekend there, I'd personally pick the Amalfi Coast over Venice.",

You can go there if you like but it will be a very tiring day a you will have to walk a lot! (I did 32km that day)\nAlso since you like city walk, you can go to Siena that is a wonderful mediaeval city (you can also add San Gimignano on the day trip to Siena) or maybe you can go to Pisa and see the Leaning tower but personally I don\u2019t like it that much because there\u2019s nothing else to see.\n\nThat said... there's only one thing you don't have to worry about\u2026 FOOD! Doesn\u2019t matter if you are in big city or a small town\u2026 you will eat delicious things EVERYWHERE! Every place has their specialties, so have fun and try more than you can!\n\nIf you need any advice or information, i will gladly help you!\nIm pretty sure you will LOVE my country! \n\nEnjoy your trip!!!",

I haven\u2019t done Rome or Florence so no help there unfortunately. \n\nMy recommendation if you want to see Pompeii is to say in Sorrento for sure. A day trip from Rome would be very long and tiring - although not impossible. \n\nPompeii, and southern Italy especially, is a lot of walking on uneven cobblestones which is tough on a leg injury. I have a year old healing ACL injury and I felt it the next day for sure. You want to make sure you have ample time to recover &amp; sleep, on paper a lot in one day looks good, but your body &amp; mind pay for it, especially on a solo trip I have found anyway. Cinque Terre would be tough on an injury too. \n\nMaybe 4 days Rome (with 1 for Ostia Antica), 3 days Florence, 2 days Venice and 2 days Sorrento (with 1 for Pompeii &amp; Herculaneum, the other to explore/rest time) \n\nGeneral Italy tips: Life is slow here. Service is slow; restaurants, shops, ticket sellers. People are not in a rush (but they are impatient) so it is hard to be in a rush yourself. That\u2019s not necessarily a negative, it\u2019s just Italian culture. My advice would be lean into it! Give yourself some free time to sit at a cafe and just lounge. The public transport will be late, and sometimes scheduled buses won\u2019t show, so you can\u2019t be too heavily attached to exact timings. These things make packing a lot into 1 day a little difficult. I have pre-booked buses with flixbus and they have ran well, they do arrive in their destination later than scheduled as the bus driver usually stops on long drives to allow people to smoke/go to the toilet/get a snack. Also, supermarkets often close around 8/9, so pre-buy food if your transport arrives after that time. \n\nAvoid taxis were possible (the price gouging is insane) and choose food places that are off the main tourist roads, even just a side street. Research &amp; book highly rated places before hand if you\u2019re super prepared! \n\nWatch out for pickpockets especially around train stations, and don\u2019t book accommodation right beside the train station - it tends to be the worst part of town. \n\nA little Italian also goes a long way (scusi will be your most used word)",

My best recommendation is don\u2019t spend too much time in the city.\nRome is so crowded and there are tons of tourists and in my opinion it\u2019s just too much and became a tourist hub rather than \u201cRome\u201d.\nSpend time in villages, talk with people. Go taste wine just to meet the farmers. Go to small local markets. In venice a few days are probably enough.",

The train from Rome to Naples is just over an hour in a direct high speed train, and then like 30 more minutes from Naples to Pompeii once you transfer. You can leave early, spend plenty of time in Pompeii, and walk around Napoli for a couple hours/ eat a pizza before heading back. \n\nRome is amazing and there\u2019s a TON to see, but if Pompeii is something you really want to see, I\u2019d say go for it. It was probably the coolest thing I saw during the trip, but I\u2019ve also wanted to go for about 20 years so that could contribute to the opinion.",

Granted it\u2019s only a few hundred kms but I hardly advice against doing it as a day trip from Florence. 5 terre are 5 towns and you plan on seeing at least 2 of them you will spend all day just moving around",

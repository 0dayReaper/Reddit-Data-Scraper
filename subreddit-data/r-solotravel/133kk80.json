I\u2019ve never done this before, and would love to know some good advice, where to start, what to carry, and possibly where to go within Europe (since I live here) based on experiences. \nAlso, I get major vertigo rushes at certain heights, and I always challenge myself by going in small hikes. This is possibly the biggest step I will take :)",

I'm not an expert, but I recommend you to do camping and hiking with someone else before starting to do it alone.Buy good clothes (pay attention to not feel cold during the night), a good tent and obv a sleeping bag (have a look at temperature grade).  You can search on internet, there are many pics that they shows you how to organize your backpack, where to put heavy and light equipment, etc.. If you don't want to buy a tent, there are a lot of hike with bivouac.During summer, pay attention because there are a lot of tick (? I don't know if is the right name in English). I was bite on my back 3 times by ones of those back in 2019, and it sucks. Quite risky too.Before hiking, have a look if you need a permit or something, and most important if you can camp with a tent (Like in Switzerland there are many place where you can't do it, and you risk a fine).Here in Europe we have so many beautiful places, so hope you can do it :)",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not going to ask where you live but just saying Europe means it is hard to give the best advice because Europe itself is big with many different countries in. Each with their own laws and dangers and things to note.\n\nSo with that, the first thing I would say is start local if possible and that means checking out your country\u2019s laws on wild camping. If you don\u2019t care about local laws then have at it but it does change how you\u2019ll be going about things. You\u2019ll want a stealth set up and will want to learn how to conceal your self as best you can if illegal. If it\u2019s totally legal then you can just spec a tent for ease of carry and comfort in the night.\n\nBut back to staying local and that\u2019s just so you have an \u201cout\u201d for if things don\u2019t go to plan and is only a temporary thing until you\u2019re comfortable with it. It\u2019s through actually getting out there that you\u2019ll learn what your limits are and what gear you need. Once you\u2019ve got this down you should be more ready to go further afield. \n\nOnto dangers, research what is going to be your biggest dangers. In Spain as an example you\u2019ll want to ensure you have more water. More Northern Europe then you\u2019ll want to pack for cold and wet weather. In the Balkan\u2019s there\u2019s a threat of land mines still so keeping to established trails is vital. You do not want to be going off trail to set up a camp if there\u2019s a threat of land mines. Are there wolves and bears in the area you\u2019ll be camping in? There\u2019s plenty to think about and it does get quite localised in some respects so you\u2019ll have to do that research.\n\nThen you\u2019ve got to figure out how you\u2019re going to defend yourself from any potential danger. For long hikes knowledge, experience and a good plan is the best protection. Knowledge and experience are what you\u2019ll build up by starting local. For personal protection so you\u2019ll have to look into what you can get as different countries have different rules on what you can use.",

And would start with somewhere close by, with an easy hike etc. once you do it the first time you will see how much useless and heavy junk you will have brought with you and how many small items you wish you had brought. For some it may be a pan, an extra pair of socks, a battery charger, better fire starting equipment. It really depends on the comforts that you personally need but I think that you need a little bit of experience before going solo and finding yourself in difficult situations alone",

The most experienced people in the mountains still have accidents. Even if it's a stranger off reddit that is coincidentally hiking the same route for a while, take them along with you.",

Most likely replacing too heavy stuff, better shoes, lighter tent, more better hiking poles, leaving not needed stuff at home, etc.\n\nThen you can continue with the bit more remote ones.\n\nMy tip: there are super lightweight tents (from Aliexpress) that weight around 1kg. They can be setup with two hiking poles within 5-10 minutes. Super comfy and spacey.",

Same goes for stuff like building fires, how to store your food safely, what animals are a risk in your region, how to layer to stay warm.\n\nI'm not sure what country you're from but if you were in Canada id recommend renting a site for a night or two in a popular campground, driving in with a car, setting up camp and staying there. This way you can learn some of the skills without the worries of total isolation which reduces a lot of the risks and have a fallback of your car if things get dicey.",

It's easy to resupply as you pass through towns and if it's raining or you long for a bed, you can sleep in a pansiyon. The entire hike is 3-4 weeks but there are numerous exit points if you feel done.",

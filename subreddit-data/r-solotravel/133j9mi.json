    "postText": "ETA: thanks for all the comments! I'm still reading through all of them. Maybe I should have specified that where I'm from, winter means temperatures around 0\u00b0C so 14\u00b0C is definitely mild to me. Though I did add a few buffer days for when it's rainy/windy! Also upped the fuel budget and noticed just now I made a mistake in the food budget, sorry! The expected expense was \u20ac1700, NOT A$, so that would be A$2800! Guess it should be much more realistic now.  \n\n\nIn June I will be going to Australia for 2 months. I'll fly to Darwin, spend a few days there with a rental car, fly to Cairns, rent a campervan and drive to Melbourne. I specifically planned my trip to be in winter because I like mild temperatures better (though I know NT and QLD are always hot). I'll spare you my entire itinerary because that would be too much, but I just wanted to ask the community for any advice on must have experiences. This is a once in a lifetime trip, so budget is a little flexible but I won't be splurging on liveaboard diving or helicopter rides. I also avoid animal experiences where the animals are not living in freedom (so no Koala holding etc).\n\nDarwin:  \nLitchfield NP  \nCrocodile cruise (Adelaide river)  \nMaybe Kakadu for the aboriginal culture but it's expensive to get there because it is far. Is it worth it or are there more accessible locations elsewhere in Australia that offer the same experience?\n\nCairns:  \nDaintree NP (incl wildlife cruise + cassowaries? Can you spot them or do they hide?)  \nGBR (Agincourt/Opal reef - haven't decided yet between snorkel or dive + swim with minke whales)  \nKuranda skyrail cableway/train\n\nCairns to Brisbane:  \nWhitsundays snorkelling daytrip  \nEungella NP (platypus)  \nCape Hillsborough NP (wallabies)  \nCapricorn caves  \nAboriginal centre Dreamtime  \nGBR (Lady Musgrave Island - diving/turtles)  \nHervey Bay (whale watching + swimming with)\n\nBrisbane + Gold Coast:  \nMoreton Island (Tangalooma wrecks snorkelling)  \nWake Park + jetski (never done it before and I'd like to try it - is it good place to do this?)\n\nBrisbane to Sydney:  \nByron Bay kayak (dolphins)  \nSouth west rocks diving with sharks  \nKoala hospital  \nSydney harbour kayaking\n\nSydney to Melbourne:  \nJervis Bay bioluminescence (if I'm lucky)  \nNarooma (seals/pelicans)  \nBuchan caves  \nRaymond Island (koalas)  \nWilsons promontory (wombats)\n\nMelbourne to Mount Gambier:  \nGreat Ocean Road  \nEwens pond (fresh water snorkelling)  \nSinkholes  \nNaracoorte caves\n\nOf course besides these experiences I'll be spending 1-2 days in the capital cities and doing lots of hiking/waterfall chasing/coastal walks.\n\nMy questions:  \nAnything obvious I'm missing?  \nAny experiences that I have listed that are better elsewhere on this route?  \nCan I spot echidnas on this route?  \nI'm thinking about adding one more diving day tour in the GBR, any suggestions on reefs?  \nI'm really torn on whether or not to go to K'gari. It looks beautiful, but the tours are super expensive and don't know if it is worth it as I'll be spending the month before that on the most beautiful beaches of Indonesia + already seeing a lot of beautiful beaches and Moreton Island in Australia as well.\n\nExpected spending would be A$1700 for food/internet/laundry (no alcohol or partying), A$3000 for activities, A$2400 for campsites and A$1400 for fuel - is it realistic?\n\nSorry for the long post. If you got this far, thank you for reading and looking forward to your replies!",

            "comment": "Just a note about wildlife in Australia.  You wil see crocodiles during the tours in Adelaide River.  You will see Kangaroos lazing about on many golf courses and moving during dusk while driving (and you will see dead ones on the side of the road).  But trying to see echidnas, cassowaries, wombats, platypus, turtles and koalas in the wild is very unusual, even in places where you should be able to see them.  Stop in to Hartleys Crocodile Adventures north of Cairns for a close look at things you have mentioned.  You could also add Australia Zoo on the Sunshine Coast to see more, if you feel you need to.\n\nThe temperature in Melbourne in July is not \"mild\".  It is cold and colder at night and make sure you have plenty of warm clothes.  I would probably recommend spending lots of time north of Byron Bay for all of your outdoor activities.  As you go further south the days are shorter colder.\n\nBudget? You are not too far off, but food will be more expensive if you are eating at cafes/restaurants.  Coles and Woolworths are the two largest national supermarkets and you will do well to get your supplies from these.  Basics like bread, vegetables and fruit are all of high quality, easily available and won't break the bank.  If you are looking for a travel partner, the hostels in Cairns would be the place to find it - maybe ask around and if you are spending a week or so in and around Cairns you might get lucky.

Koalas guaranteed in Raymond Island. Wombats you'll almost certainly see in Wilson's Prom campsite. Echindas are a bit trickier. There's a chance they'll be spotted on a hike or the road but no sure thing. \n\nOP is actually pretty spot here.

I also like 'milder' weather, hate anything over 30 degrees, bit I still complain about how cold it is all the time during Winter. Just keep in mind that aside from being able to watch an AFL game in Melbourne at this time of year, I would suggest people visit this part of Australia in the summer to get a better experience. Melbourne is truly my favourite place in the worls, but if you're alone and it's raining and cold it can be a depressive place. \n\nAlso unfortunately petrol has been super expensive lately like someone above commented. 2 years ago I would usually fill my small car up for about $50, now it's more like $80. $3,000 for activities doesn't seem like a lot either tbh. A holiday in Australia is bloody expensive, to the point where it's true that it can be cheaper for Aussies to go abroad to Bali or Thailand for a holiday than for us to holiday in our own country. \n\nIf you're spending long days driving by yourself, on some of those days you'll probably be tired and sick of driving, and you'll buy convenient take away food and take away drinks like coffee to stay awake, which will cut into your food budget as food is expensive here. I'm talking like around $12 for a shitty small coffee and a pie or other pastry from a servo (petrol station). Just being realistic that you'll likely spend more on food than you realise on travel days. That happened to me on my long term solo trip because when you're figuring out everything for yourself in a foreign country, it can be very mentally taxing and getting take away is convenient when you don't feel up to making a meal. I definitely under-budgeted for food.\n\nSounds like you'll love Australia though and you will have a great time. All the best planning the rest of your trip \ud83d\ude0a",

Because of other things I totally messed up the planning/time needed and did not have enough time to explore in the various stops but it was still beautiful. Your itinerary seems well thought out. A few tips I can give is to book campsites in advance (meaning same day, don\u2019t just arrive there). Since you\u2019ll be going in winter days are short and it\u2019s better to be at the campsite before sunset (kangaroos are the stupidest animals when it comes to traffic/road kill). Also I went to a koala sanctuary near port stephens and it wasn\u2019t anything special..don\u2019t know if that is the one you are referring to. Also near Sydney, Anna Bay is a nice stop with the sand dunes directly leading to the ocean and great for kitesurfing. Finally get a wetsuit to protect from stingers and the unforgiving sun rays.

Can you spot them or do they hide?)\n&gt;GBR (Agincourt/Opal reef - haven't decided yet between snorkel or dive + swim with minke whales)\n&gt;Kuranda skyrail cableway/train\n\nCassowaries are about but it's very possible to spend a week in cape tribulation and not see one.  If you want to stay in the daintre itself, I'd recommended Noah's creek eco huts.  There are a bunch of native fruit trees in the paddock where the huts are so you've a good chance of seeing one wander past while you're having breakfast if you stay there.\n\nYou can see a cassowary in kuranda, there's one at bird world but yeah, similar to holding koalas it left me feeling a bit uneasy seeing the cassowary in a cage (even if it is a giant aviary).\n\nI'd definitely recommend spending a few nights up in/around cape trib, it's a beautiful place and it's nice to be able to relax and not be in a rush to see everything and get back to cairns.\n\nMake you you stop by the daintree ice cream company in Diwan on you're way up to cape trib.  They make ice cream from the native fruits and you can wander around the orchard while you enjoy it.\n\nIf you enjoy a hike, mount sorrow in cape trib is good.  A bit steep at parts (there's ropes to assist).  About 3-4 hour return, expect leeches once you're above the rope assist section.  When you make it to the look out, disregard the danger signs and carry on past it, about 5-10 mins further along there's a much better view.\n\nYou can also go snorkelling from cape trib, they go to Mackay reef.  It's about 25 mins on the boat, an hour in the water then an hour on the sandcay.  Highly recommended, though I've not snorkelled anywhere else so I can't compare.\n\n&gt;I'm really torn on whether or not to go to K'gari. It looks beautiful, but the tours are super expensive and don't know if it is worth it as I'll be spending the month before that on the most beautiful beaches of Indonesia + already seeing a lot of beautiful beaches and Moreton Island in Australia as well.\n\nPersonally I have little interest in k'gari.  It's probably the best place in Australia to see wild dingos but I'm of the opinion that it should be left to the dingos and wildlife.\n\n&gt;Can I spot echidnas on this route?\n\nEchidna are pretty all over the east coast, just a bit shy.",

I went on a few dive and snorkel trips on the reef (6 separate trips, iirc), and if you are new to diving then you'll have less hassle and see just as much beautiful scenery if you snorkel. A lot of the newer divers I went with were so stressed about the equipment that they got to take in less of the scenery. And the scenery near the surface is usually the most interesting anyway, with the most fish, plants and life. It's also usually cheaper.\n\nI went snorkeling out from Cairns, and it was great. If you are a scuba diver however, I can recommend diving from Townsville. The reef is a lot further out, but you can dive on the Yongala shipwreck and on other cool reefs that I don't remember the name of right now, and you get a proper boat trip with some beautiful views both ways. Yongala was super cool, and you literally dive with poisonous sea snakes and the occasional turtle.\n\nIf you go to Kuranda, you can also take the bus one way instead of the sky rail. I went there by bus and my friend by rail, and while she was underwhelmed by the view, I loved taking the bus up the mountain through the rainforest, and just through completely normal Australian scenery.

As you say, it's less hassle and a good way to save some money. Maybe I'll just do 1 dive trip and 2 snorkel trips then instead of the other way around.

I would really recommend spending another day there rather than visiting Moreton. It is beautiful gif the quality of snorkelling, environment and wildlife is far better in the Whitsundays. \n\nNot sure where you\u2019re from but June is our winter and it definitely does get cold. You\u2019ll need winter clothing and the water will be pretty chilly.",

            "comment": "Wouldn\u2019t go out of your way to see wallabies, if you drive at night on quieter roads you\u2019ll see them anyway. Kangaroos and wallabies are basically Australia\u2019s version of deer. Which is weird because australia has deer\n\nCassowaries are bright and colourful. But they tend to be hard to find until you\u2019re too close since they live in fairly thick rainforest. They\u2019re highly territorial so try not to be too close. If you have time, there\u2019s a zoo near Brisbane called Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary that used to have a cassowary when I visited last. I know you said that you prefer to see the animals living in freedom but this place puts most of its money towards conservation efforts for koalas which are struggling atm so it\u2019s got a bit of a silver lining \n\nMake sure you try a parmi at some point, as well as chicken salt on hot chips. When you\u2019re in Melbourne you might hear people call it a Parma. Tell them it\u2019s parmi, not Parma. Get into a big argument about it. It\u2019s customary to do this\n\nEchidnas are fairly widespread, but you\u2019ll have to explore on foot and actively look for them most likely. They\u2019re small and hide in long grass or scrub. Most zoos will have an echidna exhibit too. In all my years I\u2019ve probably just randomly encountered an echidna maybe 5 or 6 times. They don\u2019t exactly jump out.\n\nYou might be a bit optimistic for your fuel costs. Outside of capital cities fuel gets expensive fast, and campervans aren\u2019t the most efficient of vehicles. The most direct route from cairns to Melbourne is 2800km, and your route is probably closer to 3500km without detours and stops. Keep in mind that australia is massive and things are far apart. I\u2019m sure you knew that already but many tourists don\u2019t seem to realise until they get here. \n\nFood costs might be a bit optimistic too but if you don\u2019t eat out too often then you could probably manage it. I could get by on $100/week for food but I usually just make a weeks worth of meals in one go and leave them in the fridge which you might not be able to do.\n\nYou might be able to save on some camping costs by sleeping in rest areas along highways. They always have toilets, and sometimes have a barbecue. But you could easily find a little gas powered camp stove for around $40 or less at camping or department stores. Probably even a camp shower (basically a black bag that you fill with water and sit in the sun all day so it warms up). Don\u2019t stay too long at rest areas though as you might get moved along by the local cop if he feels like being a dick that day. \n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t spend too long in capital cities. The real attractions of Australia is in the regional and rural areas and there\u2019s really not a lot of uniqueness about the cities. No 1000 year old church\u2019s or castle, few sites of historic significance. Just a big bridge, a funny shaped opera house, a few museums and some tall buildings. Seems you aren\u2019t spending huge amounts of time in cities anyway so you might already know this. Though I would recommend visiting paddy\u2019s market in Sydney. Not that it\u2019s a must do thing, or even distinctly Australian. I just think it\u2019s an interesting place. Queen Victoria markets in Melbourne is a bit shit though \n\nOtherwise, you seem to have a pretty busy and planned out trip. Enjoy, and watch out for drop bears and hoop snakes",

We saw a cassowary on the Cape trib tour but was told its quite rare. \n\nAs far as seeing animals in the wild (on the east coast) I saw a Koala in the wild while doing a walk on Magnetic Island. Theres also LOTS of wild wallabys  and trails to walk on maggie island as well. If you like nature it may be worth a visit. \n\nNoosa was nice with lots of trails in the national park, there's signs saying that you might see koalas but I did quite a few walks and never saw any koalas. Lots of cool spidebrs though. \n\nThe Australis zoo was lots of fun. \n\nI think Byron bay is lovely but it is a bit touristy, i enjoyed my time there none the less. The walk to the lighthouse is very nice and I reccomend  doing it while you are there. Someone else in the comments mentioned that the area around byron bay is lovely and thats one thing I regret not checking out (I didn't have or know anyone with a car) but you will have a van so def check out the surrounds. \n\nI hope you enjoy your trip! I just returned from my trip to Australias east coast and I'm a wee bit jealous of everyone else travelling there right now.",

It got in the way of doing a few of our planned activities. Alot of the places in southern NSW were flooding, hopefully that's not an issue for U this year. Southern Vic can get quite cold in winter, I wouldn't describe the temperature as 'mild' during that time of the year, prepare for the temp to not get much higher than 14 degrees. That's being said, winter can also be a good time to go BC there's not as many tourists around. Wilson's Prom is a fantastic place to see wombats, they're always chilling around the campsites at night. If U have the time, stop off at Mallacoota, they have a rlly fun lakes system to explore and you can hire kayaks. \n\nIf you haven't already I would suggest using the wikkicamps app, it's a great source of information, particularly about free camping sites! I think you've chosen some rlly great spots, hope you have a blast:)",

Plenty of amazing nature walks, beaches, views, etc.\n\nIf you wanted to check out some sort of animal exhibits that I think would be alright I would definitely check out a reptile zoo. There are a few good ones in NSW if you want to do some research the smaller animals are well taken care of and very Aussie ;)\n\nSome advice for Sydney...\n\n\\- don't spend your money on the bridge climb or any touristy activity that involves moving around (i.e. walking tours, buses, restaurant tours, etc.). I would choose \\*1\\* water-based activity like the jet boats if you want but the best of Sydney Harbour you can see walking around the shore and getting the ferry across if you want. \n\n\\- GET AN OPAL CARD!! (for NSW travel). \n\n\\- Walking around the city and the harbour is gorgeous and I would definitely opt for a picnic  on some grassy area (a park - or if you want a view of the harbour there's a good grassy spot next to the museum of contemporary art) is far better spent than in the opera house or some other touristy overpriced restaurant. When eating outside - DO NOT FEED THE BIRDS. \n\n\\- for must-take photos - the steps of the opera house, and when on a ferry. \n\n\\- explore out the city! Greater Sydney is \\*huge\\* and there are so many cool little corners to discover - if you like the arts, fashion, cool foody spots, or asian food you can find some real gems outside city central. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhope this helps xx",

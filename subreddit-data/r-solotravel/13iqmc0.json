    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nIn a few weeks I\u2019ll be visiting Oslo on the tail end of my post-school year vacation (excited to make Norway country #20!). I\u2019ll have three full days, and I\u2019m very curious about the best outdoor experiences while there. I understand that the best \u201ctrue\u201d hiking that Norway has to offer is largely in other parts of the country, but I\u2019m wondering if you have outdoor hiking suggestions in the immediate area? \n\nAdvances fitness level if that has any impact. \n\nI\u2019ve read a bit about Grefsenkollen and Vettakollen, those seem like pretty relaxing treks. Any others that I shouldn\u2019t miss?\n\nOpen to any and all other Oslo suggestions, too! \n\nThanks so much!!",

But I\u2019d recommend visiting Vigeland Sculpture Park if you want a to take a break from more strenuous activities. It\u2019s a chill place for a nice stroll and it\u2019s fun to look at the art. If you go, seek out the sculpture \u201cMann Jager Fire Genier\u201d (aka \u201cMan Attacked by Babies\u201d) if you want a good chuckle. The Norske Folkemuseum was also a cool outdoor place to wander around. Hope you have a great trip. Sorry I couldn\u2019t offer any specific hiking suggestions.",

Lots of people were trying the smoked whale. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have more recommendations since I was only in Olso for two days while I connected from Bergen to Copenhagen. Hope you have a nice trip!",

            "comment": "Oslo has great hiking opportunities. Some other places have evne more scenic routes, so Oslo tends to get less attention. But you can tak the metro and be in the middle of a forrest. The Nordmarka forest stretches 100 km northwards from Oslo and starts right in the city. It has lots and lots of good hiking trails.",

    "postText": "I've booked about a 2.5 month trip to Europe later this summer/fall. For about a week or so at the start and end of the trip, I'll be staying with some relatives in the UK, but in between that for about 9 weeks straight, I'll be solo travelling around Europe. For some extra context, I'm 22M.\n\nI'll also be working remotely (workcation) during the week evenings/nights to sync up with US time. For this reason, I want to keep the constant travel kind of light and maybe stick to one city every week so that it's not too hectic. Some days I might just chill in the room and do my usual at-home stuff. What do y'all think about this idea?\n\nI've been to Europe about a year back and visited London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Paris, and Amsterdam, so I don't intend on visiting those again. I wasn't really working during that trip, though, and I was travelling as part of a group.\n\nAnyways, my rough plan is like so:\n\n* **Week 1:** Oslo, Norway\n* **Week 2:** Stockholm, Sweden\n* **Week 3:** Berlin, Germany\n* **Week 4:** Prague, Czech Republic\n* **Week 5:** Vienna, Austria\n* **Week 6:** Rome, Italy\n* **Week 7:** Barcelona, Spain\n* **Week 8:** Madrid, Spain\n* **Week 9:** Lisbon, Portugal\n\nI tried plotting it a bit geographically, and also so that I can visit some of the northern countries before it gets colder. I'm not too sure about my choices, so I'm open to suggestions or changes. Is one week in each city too long? Is it worth visiting both Barcelona *and* Madrid?\n\nAlso, I suppose flying is the best and cheapest option to get between each of these places? Except maybe Spain, I'm guessing there's a train or bus between Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nFor accomodation, I'm wondering what's the best option for one week stays. I'm probably not really interested in hostels because I need a quiet space to work and attend meetings. I'm considering staying in a hotel for like half the week and then maybe an Airbnb the latter half of the week. That way I can do laundry easily and maybe even cook something if I get tired of eating out. Plus the extra space would be nice.\n\nMy budget is about $10k for the trip, of which I've already spent about $1k on the airfare. For hotels or Airbnbs, my budget is around $120/night. I suppose it's doable, but I know Airbnbs can have a lot of extra fees.\n\nAnyways, has anyone else done a long-term workcation to Europe and have any advice? Even if you haven't, I'd still be interested in hearing your thoughts. Thanks!",

            "comment": "My advice is don't fly, take trains everywhere you can. For one, you can work on the train. So that gives you more free time. \n\nBut in literally every case no matter how long the train ride is, it's so much faster and less stressful than airport wait times. The queues were insane when I was there last time, though maybe they're better staffed now. But between luggage and transport to airports and so on, even a ten hour train would have been better for me in every case.\n\nHard to say on your timeline but personally from what I learned in my three months abroad last year, I'd opt for two weeks in cities. Itll be cheaper  and give.you more time to feel like you really live there. especially since youre working, I felt like I was ALWAYS on the move. When I wanted a day to relax and just work late I literally couldn't because I was running out of time\n\nAlso big recommend to hotels when you can. Especially gone that long. The privacy is so much better than sharing someone's one bed apartment",

I can be at the airport from my home in 15 minutes, I go through security in another 15 and then I chill for 45-50 minutes before my gate opens, and all in all in about 3-4 hours I can be nearly anywhere in Europe. Make it 6 hours if it's somewhere that doesn't have a direct flight.\n\nIn 4 hours with the train I can't even get halfway through Italy.\nFor long routes (1000km+) the train is also often going to be extremely more expensive than flying.\n\nHigh speed train makes sense for routes less than about 750-1000km and assuming you don't need a car at the other end, since train stations don't usually have car hire services, or if you get a night train AND you're someone that can actually sleep restfully on a moving train.",

Between countries, half of these countries have mountains or seas separating them from their neighbors, so good trains don't even exist.\n\nAt least most high-speed rail terminals are at central metro stations, so if you're staying in a large city, you can get around fairly easily. Airports tend to be further away from the city. But even with the extra travel from the city to the airport, flying is usually cheaper and faster than train for most long trips.",

My experience is that if you work full time, a week is nowhere nearly enough + its a lot more costly. \n\nI\u2019d pick 3 cities and just stay there, and travel around the area if you really must. If you stay one week in a city, lets say you wanna go out one night in the weekend and the other day of the weekend you use for travel\u2026 it gets tiring for 9 weeks. \n\nBerlin, Barcelona, prague, lisbon you can easily pass a month without realising.\n\nAnother thing is, Europe is more expensive then ever. With 120us you dont get a place per night in Barcelona or Rome these days + flights are 150-200 euros towards the south of Europe.\n\nMy advice is don\u2019t cross cities off a list, working and travelling is more exhausting than it first appears. Take your time and enjoy the places to make it worth the cost.",

I would almost recommend staying longer than a week at some of the places, especially if you get there and find them interesting. I know when I took a 2 month Europe trip last summer, I regretted skipping around to so many places so fast. I\u2019m not sure of your exact goal with visiting each city, but if you\u2019re wanting to get to know a city fairly well, then maybe staying a bit longer in some of them would be nice. Having a weekend in most of the cities would probably be nice to have.\n\nIn terms of jumping from city to city, I feel like train or flying is fine - just pick whatever is best for that particular start and end destinations.\n\nI think some cities, you can find affordable accomodation. I know you can often get a discount at places (such as Airbnbs) for a week long stay or more. So it might be good to see if there are any decent discounts for that. If you\u2019re interested and feel comfortable doing so, you could see if there are any couchsurfing options around the city (such as on Couchers.org or Bewelcome.org). This is just where people will open up their homes to host travelers and you can request to stay with someone if you look at their profile and decide you\u2019d wanna stay with them.\n\nIf the wifi is terrible some of the days at your accomodation, I\u2019m almost certain the cities you have listed will have caf\u00e9s you can go work at, but I realize you\u2019ll be working in the evening which might be a little bit tough in terms of what caf\u00e9s are available.\n\nThis sounds like an awesome time and I\u2019d love to hear how this goes!

You\u2019re going to be exhausted traveling so much and working at the same time. I recommend checking out Selina hostels, they have amazing cowork spaces in many cities and was the reason I was able to make friends along the way. I would 100% do it again. \n\nOne other recommendation, check out smaller cities too. Like Porto instead of Lisbon. Porto was my favorite place I stayed.",

I definitely want to visit Porto as well but Lisbon is very much worth it for a capital city.",

Your budget is all reasonable as I look for similar accommodation and generally I try to find things for $100 - $150 AU. It tends to balance out and booking places for a week sometimes come with a discount. Have fun!",

Some of the cities you're going to (Rome, Madrid, Barcelona, Libson) also are pretty hefty and have a lot to explore",

All the cities you mentioned are worth a visit (personally don\u2019t know about Oslo as I\u2019ve never been). If you really must choose I would go to Barcelona instead of Madrid (but then again, packed with people in summer). On the other hand going to Italy and just going to wonderful (but chaotic) Rome seems a wasted opportunity..but I\u2019m Italian so might be biased on this. So maybe take a train from Italy, cross through southern France with some nice stops on the way towards Barcelona?",

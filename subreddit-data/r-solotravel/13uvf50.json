I tell him the time \u201coh, I thought you were Greek\u201d (I\u2019m a white as can be American with no Greek features)\n\nFriendly fella, naturally. Asks if I\u2019m here alone. For safety purposes said no, with friends but they\u2019re at the hotel I\u2019m headed to.\n\nEnded the conversation with a \u201ccome to my cafe and we drink as friends since just met, I give you my card\u201d\n\nThankfully I easily skirted out of it by saying I was running late for a tour.\n\nI would\u2019ve definitely thought this guy was just being friendly as I\u2019ve read many Greeks are. But thanks to this sub, I was able to pinpoint the red flags and nope right out.\n\nAlso checked my pockets to make sure I have everything, which I do.\n\nThank you everyone and safe travels!!",

An especially common version involves young (and sometimes not) women inviting especially young and especially solo men traveling to \u2018a really good bar\u2019 or a \u2018party\u2019 they know - where they similarly charge completely ridiculous prices and the owner claims that you owe them for not only your 50 euro beer but the drinks for the girls you \u2018brought with you\u2019 too.",

You get invited to a bar and drink with a \"new friend\" -- sometimes you are even drugged -- then charged out the wazoo for the cost of the drinks. The con is in on the take, they probably make a tidy profit as it's all about luring the mark back to the \"bar\" to run the charges.\n\nTechnically, it's not theft! You just drank too much of your own accord \ud83d\ude43\n\nBut I could see that happening elsewhere too, especially to women travellers :/",

At one point I was focusing on something and two people (a girl and a guy) stopped to look at what I was photographing. They got curious, asked me some stuff, we talked for a bit and they asked if I had already been to some other landmark. Said nope, so they said they'd walk me there. They were going to buy some groceries first, so I tagged along, went to their place, had coffee with them, then we headed out all together. Spent the rest of the day hitting cool spots. They gave me an amazing tour of the city, including at night, which would have been advised against had I been alone. We exchanged contacts and met up a few more times in the following days. \n\nBottom line is, some random encounters still are harmless and can make your whole trip. I'd wager, be aware of typical scams for the location you're at (they do follow a bit of a script...), don't drop your guard and get a reading on the people approaching you. Stall if need be and test them out, and if you feel like following them, don't ever feel like you \"can't say no\". If things get sketchy or you feel uncomfortable at any point, don't feel compelled to stay, just pick up your things and leave. Better safe than sorry, but do know not everybody is out there to get you.",

            "comment": "Long ago I hitchhiked in Greece. I was about 22, white American. A chap picked me up and drove for awhile on an asphalt road, then turned off on a dirt track. Tried to rape me, but I fought him off. Luckily he wasn\u2019t too aggressive and drove off leaving me there at the end of a dirt road, but at least not raping me. \n\nI walked back to the main road and, being far from any town or public transport, stuck my thumb out again. A car filled with young men and women stopped and picked me up. Though we had few words in common they were extremely kind. With body language and a few words I showed what had happened to me. \n\nOne of he young men (a shepherd) took me to his mother\u2019s place where I stayed for several days. She fed me very well. \n\nThe lesson I learned was to not let a bad encounter prevent me from meeting genuinely decent people.",

He'd noticed me wandering around, obviously lost, looking for a bus to my Airbnb location. He stopped and told me that because there was some kind of race or rally going on, I don't remember which, the buses weren't running as normal but told me the stop to wait at and said he'd swing by in a little while to see if the bus had come. Well, it was like 10:00 at night, the bus never came, so he offered me a ride and I accepted it because I wasn't getting any weird vibes, and this was pre-easy ride share app stuff. But... I was EXTREMELY wary - hung on to my backpack myself, and had my phone in my hand the entire time making sure that we were headed in the direction of the destination. When we got there, he gave me his phone number and said I should go out for Greek food with him - which never happened - and that was the end of it.\n\nI'm sure I'll get skewered here for being such an idiot but I believe you have to follow your gut sometimes. Sounds like you followed yours.",

I didn't realize that the Berbers were an ethnic people native to the Maghreb. So I followed him to a fairly unpopulated place and he pointed in doors telling me what the men in the rooms made (like trinkets to be sold). Turned out fine. \n\nLater that month I had someone trying to get me to go from Frankfurt to Berlin to drive rich men around for a weekend. Seemed like a nice guy.

            "comment": "I don't know if I'm right about this, but I'm always surprised when I read these stories, at how far along the conversation gets. Why are they stopping to respond and giving the scammers an open to keep trying. I'm not saying you shouldn't be polite, but they're picking you because you're showing that you're an easy mark. It's like when an animal can smell fear on you. You can be polite and say no thank you, or whatever, but why stop and engage? From my experience, you have to give off an aura of confidence and being disinterested. Plenty of women have done it to me in my life. It's the same thing. A local who's going about their business isn't going to stop and get into a thing because they actually have somewhere to go and things to do. Why do you have to come up with an excuse and explain to a stranger where you're going or what you're doing? The fact that you're showing that you are, or that you don't have anything keeping you shows that you're a tourist, and tells them exactly what they need to know. It sounds messed up, but sometimes, particularly if you're getting a bad vibe, you have to act like you're stuck up and don't care. Seems like some people here, and I'm not directing this at OP or anyone in particular, act like they feel they have to be so accommodating to the locals out of guilt, a desperation to meet locals and have an \"authentic\" experience, or maybe just fear and not enough street smarts that they're setting themselves up for it. You don't have to be a dick about it, but you can say no thank you as you're still walking. If they're being persistent, than just ignore them. If you're at one of those markets where everyone is trying to hussle you, do you stop to explain yourself to everyone of them? Am I wrong here?  \n\nFor people saying, \" but I once met a local, and ...\", well, so have I. It's one of the main reasons I love travel. I'm not saying you can't engage with people, but I am saying that you can choose when, or when not to, engage with people. It will require some judgement, which hopefully will come to you with experience, but you don't have to feel that you're required to engage with anyone, anywhere, at any time. If you probably wouldn't do it at home, why should you feel obligated to do so when traveling? Why feel forced to do anything you're not comfortable with, ever? You can still meet locals in a situation where it's more organic, you're getting a better vibe from them, and you feel more comfortable, as opposed to worrying that you're going to look like a dick if you don't kiss everybody's ass, and look rude to people that you're not likely to ever see again in your life.  \n\nHere's how I would've reacted were I in the situation explained by OP. (shaking my head, maybe even waving back and forth with my hand in front of me) \"No, no, no, no. Thank you my friend. I'm good.\" (they ask if I'm alone) \"Ok. Thank you. Have a nice day my friend!\" (then i turn and walk away)  \n\nI mean right now, we're talking about the context of a stupid scam. Regardless though, you're best bet is always going to be to end the engagement as quickly as possible, and remove yourself from the situation, however you do it.  \n\n\"But what if we would've turned out to be best buds, and he shows me all the cool local spots, and we had grand adventures together?\" It's probably a red flag if one of the first things a person that you've never met before wants to learn about you is if you're alone. That's not a primary thing that pops in to a person's mind when they're making chit chat, and trying to get to know you. Particularly when it's very visibly obvious that you are alone! What's their concern? That you won't soon be alone? That other people will suddenly appear and you'll no longer be alone? That should feel like a weird thing for a person to ask you. There's the random off chance that it isn't actually, but since you're deciding what situations you place yourself in, how much of a chance do you want to take that it isn't?  \n\nFor those of you that just get caught up in it out of fear... don't! If fear is your motivation, than your best bet is also to leave. People do it all the time, and in some much more horrific situations than this that don't have anything to do with travel, but if you're afraid of something, WHY WOULD YOU NOT WANT TO GET AWAY FROM IT?! Get away from it! What do you think is going to happen if you don't? Are you going to get lucky enough to say and do the right thing that will make them take pity on you, and all of a sudden they'll have the capacity to think better to not do what ever it is they're probably definitely going to do? Maybe, but again, why take that chance? Because the odds are against you. Just leave.  \n\nAgain, so far we've been talking in the context of a stupid scam, but even if it's worse than that, the thing you have to keep in mind whatever the situation, is that the odds are that they're looking for the easiest target that they can find. They're not looking for their Everest. You understand? They're not looking for a challenge, so that as Jim Croche would say, when the bad folks all get together at night, they can brag about the unbelievable task they pulled off. If they had that kind of initiative and pride in a job well done, they might not be doing what they're doing, and if you don't be the easiest target, they're very likely to pass you over for the one that is. If you walk away, you're probably not that worth following. If they're the type that would follow, they probably just would've skipped the conversation, and done that right away. Either way, there's no advantage to you to stay. Keep moving. Get to a place where there are more people that aren't them, and they'll be even less likely to do anything, or if they do, there's the majority of people that aren't them, and will be likely to help. If you feel desperate enough, just \"Run, Forrest Run!\"  \n\nChances are the situation isn't likely to call for that, but whatever. Worst case scenario is that a bunch of strangers that you'll never see again will get a show out of it, you'll get out of a situation where you felt uncomfortable, and you'll have a story to tell, maybe to the local that you do end up befriending.  \n\nThis is probably way out of the context of this conversation, but I just don't understand why anyone would stay in a bad situation, and hope that it'll get better. That's probably not true. There are reasons, and I've done it myself, but you get my point. There is another alternative that I haven't mentioned because I didn't think it was applicable to most, but you could always fight! That's a mixed bag too that also requires judgment. Depending on the situation, you'll have varying odds with varying results that'll determine how much of a good or bad idea it is. It's usually not the best idea, but if you're capable, is sometimes necessary. I'll tell you one thing though, sometimes just looking like you'll fight will be a deterent to these situations.",

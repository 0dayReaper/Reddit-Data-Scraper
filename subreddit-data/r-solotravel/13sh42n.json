    "postText": " I'm a 38 yo. male solo traveling this summer and looking for an island recommendation.  I will be traveling around Italy in early September and would like to take 4-5 days to hang out/ party on a Greek or other Mediterranean Island. I have been to Corfu, Mykonos, Ios and Santorini in the past and liked them all. \n\nLooking for beaches/ scenery,  food/ culture and good nightlife. \n\nNot looking for expensive Mykonos/ Santorini pricing.\n\nI was thinking about Crete but it seems too big (maybe too little time to explore) and the cheap flights are not that easy on my dates.\n\nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated!",

The problem with Ios is you must get their by boat which means you must fly to another island first then either backtrack or add a third island to leave. The islands without airports are often less spoiled but require more effort to get to. Catch 22",

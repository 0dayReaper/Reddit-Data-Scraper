    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm travelling to Barcelona from 20th-23rd June (first ever solo trip!!) and was hoping someone could have a look at my itinerary and tell me what they think/any suggestions welcome!\n\nDay 1 -  land in BCN 10.20am, take Aerobus to the centre. Hotel is in Gothic Quarter so explore Las Ramblas, check in at hotel in afternoon, lunch at El Xampanyet. Gothic Quarter walking tour at 3pm. Spend rest of evening wandering Parc Ciutdella/Arc de Trimof/La Barceloneta\n\nDay 2 - Park Guell (get there for 9.30-10am), maybe go to La Boqueria beforehand. Explore Gracia, visit Recinte Modernista de Sant Pau. 5pm-8pm do this paella cooking class ([https://www.airbnb.co.uk/experiences/29758](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/experiences/29758)). Head to Bunkers del Carmel for sunset views.\n\nDay 3 - La Sagrada Familia (definitely going inside and up one of the towers, any recommendation on which one?), Casa Batllo, La Pedrera. Considering going inside Palau de la Musica Catalana. Lunch/dinner at Quimet y Quimet. Montjuic cable car and castle, then watch a Magic Fountain light show\n\nDay 4 - Day trip to Sitges - I was thinking of picking up some stuff for a picnic at one of the markets like Santa Caterina before taking the train to Sitges. Or I could just eat there - I haven't done much research on Sitges yet so if you have any recommendations please let me know! Flight back is at 21:45 so I will aim to be back at the airport by about 18:45\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are very much the building blocks for my trip and I am open to any suggested changes! Thanks :D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: After some research I've found that Turo de la Rovira is closed from 7.30pm now so will probably change my evening plans for day 2!",

            "comment": "Make sure that you book the Sagrada Familia in advance, when I was there in November we were unable to get inside! Ditto Park Guell - it was very frustrating to walk up a massive hill and then get turned away. \n\nIf you get into Park Guell and the Sagrada Familia then Casa Batllo may be redundant. It's quite expensive and you basically just shuffle through an empty house in a massive line for a few hours. It's absolutely packed and was very hot in November, so it will be roasting in June. My background is in architecture so I was really looking forward to it but the whole visitor experience left a lot to be desired.\n\nOne of our highlights was the Carmel Bunkers sunset. You'll want to really rush out of that paella class - sunset will be around 9.30 and you need to get there early to find a good spot as it is very very popular. You can get there by public transit but it's another steep uphill walk. Bring something to sit on - you'll be sitting directly on sharp rock/concrete and it was actually quite gross with people spitting out sunflower seed shells and the like.",

I had a similar class with a different company and loved it.  The recipes to repeat at home are the best souvenir.\n\nThe El Born district is right next to the Gothic Quarter.  I really liked wandering those streets.\n\nHave a fantastic time",

Lots of kids go out with fireworks, etc, it is very possible there might be traffic jams on the way to airport.",

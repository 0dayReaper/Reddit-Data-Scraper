    "postText": "(23F in the US) So I was granted a golden opportunity, I thought I\u2019d have to start my job in early June but my start date was pushed back to September. I have dreamed of doing a backpacking trip for around two years now, and didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to until about a year and a half after graduation when it is deemed \u201cacceptable\u201d to quit a job. \nNow, I\u2019m left with May, June and July to get enough money together and prepare for a trip. \nStarting off - is this enough time?\nI can start preparing now but can\u2019t start working until June. \n\nNext - the fun part \nI\u2019ve seen a few routes so I\u2019d love some help deciding. I\u2019m pretty equally interested in every country (except Brazil, I\u2019d love to go just not yet), so between Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, what do you recommend? I don\u2019t want to spread myself too thin but also I\u2019d love to see at least two countries three would be incredible. Flying into Peru or Ecuador would be nice for the shortest plane rides because I\u2019ve never flown for more than 4 and I can\u2019t even imagine sitting still for 13 right off the bat. \n\nSpeaking of, a big concern of mine is the bus system. I don\u2019t turn my nose up at much and I\u2019m usually the least prissy of the group but I don\u2019t know if I can handle the bus rides. I know. I get insanely carsick and claustrophobic on busses. My limit is probably 5/6 hours. A pretty big reservation to have going into South America. If anyone could give me any pointers on flying, how to get cheap flights, any tips and tricks, it would be a game changer. However, If not, I\u2019ll suck it up. \n\nWhat destinations do I not want to miss? Are there any festivals or events going on at this time? Hostel recommendations? Anything and everything is appreciated. Also any women travelers I\u2019d love to hear from you. \n\nFinal question, vaccines? Any visas or special entry requirements? Covid requirements? Anything you think a first time backpacker should know. I\u2019ve been reading every blog out there but there\u2019s always more to learn.  \n\nNow onto budget again. How much should I expect to spend in prep. Ex. Backpack, clothes, gear, vaccines, anything like this. This is an area where I have absolutely no idea. I don\u2019t think I have much already that would work. I\u2019ll definitely need new walking shoes, and I\u2019m not sure if I wanted to bring any of my nice athletic clothes down there. \n\nI\u2019d like to find the flight for about $600-$700 (that\u2019s what I\u2019m seeing on google flights right now, if there\u2019s tricks to find one cheaper please let me know!) and maybe have $2000 for the month? I\u2019m seeing very alternating opinions on this. Some people say $4000 for a month is tight and others say you can do it on $1200. Besides my bus issue I\u2019m okay with all aspects of budget travel, definitely will be staying in group dorms, street food, whole nine yards. The only area I\u2019m fuzzy on is what activities I\u2019m going to want to do and how much they\u2019ll cost. \n\nIf anyone has taken a one month trip and has a ballpark # of what everything including prep cost you\u2019d be my best friend \n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of for now, a lot I know, all help appreciated, brutal honestly needed, thanks in advance",

            "comment": "Travelling through South America while avoiding busses is going to be very difficult, if not impossible. For example, if you go to Peru and want to see Macchu Picchu, you will need to take a 2 hour bus ride then a 2 hour train ride (equally as bumpy) from the nearest airport city (Cusco).",

            "comment": "Yeah avoiding long busses is going to be a tough one honestly. There\u2019s not a lot of flights between \u201csecondary\u201d destinations, meaning between 2 cities that aren\u2019t the capital. \n\nColombia would be your best bet for this imo, they have great and cheap domestic flights. I know Cuzco has a couple flights to other cities in Peru. But Ecuador for example, it\u2019s practically unavoidable unless you just stay close to Quito, like no further than ba\u00f1os. \n\nCheck out the website flight connections .com if you want to see what I mean, it shows all flights from any city you want on a map",

            "comment": "South America has big countries, so if you want to avoid long distance buses you will need to take multiple flights, specially if you want to see more than one country.\n\nIf you want to travel by bus and keep distances reasonable, you should probably pick one country and stick with it. Maybe pick two cities in neighbor countries and to start and finish your trip, but knowing you will be able to see only a fraction of each.\n\n\nArgentina is probably the worst for you. It's huge and spread out, so even if you spend a whole month there you will probably still need to take several long distance buses. Chile will also demand long journeys if you want to make it all the way down to Patagonia.\n\nPeru and Colombia are doable (probably Ecuador too, but I haven't been there). They are still big countries but there is always many interesting cities and towns to stop for a few days along the way. You can probably go all over those countries without needing long bus journeys. Also, you can easily spend a few months in each and there will be plenty to do.\n\nAnyway, you should probably pick a country based on what are your interests, since convenience of travel is similar eveywhere. Between those two countries, I'd say Colombia is better for modern history, beaches and islands, and being social. Peru is better for ancient history, mountains, hiking and food.",

            "comment": "With only one month, I would either do Central America or focus on one country in South America. Despite looking close on the map, going from country to country in South America takes quite a bit of time, and domestic flights are expensive if you don\u2019t want to take long buses.\n\nI\u2019ve traveled Central America many times. If you have a month, I would recommend: 1 week Honduras, 2 weeks Guatemala, 1 week El Salvador.\n\nIf you insist on South America, maybe choose Colombia. There\u2019s a lot of cities with different vibes and it\u2019s relatively easy to get around.",

            "comment": "If you really want to avoid buses you can. Just find 4-5 cities that have airports.\n\nExample general itinerary:\nDay 1: Fly to Cartagena, Colombia \n    Stay in Cartagena for 4 nights\nDay 5: Fly to Medell\u00edn, Colombia \n     Stay in Medell\u00edn for 6 nights\nDay 11: Fly to Lima, Peru\n     Stay in Lima for 4 nights\nDay 16: Fly to Cusco, Peru\n     Stay in Cusco for 5 nights (could use this time to hike        to Machu Picchu)\nDay 21: Fly to Cuenca, Ecuador\n     Stay 5 nights in Cuenca\nDay 26: Fly to Quito, Ecuador\n     Stay 4 nights in Quito\nDay 30: Fly home\n\nIf you like cities and hate buses this would be a decent itinerary for a month.\n\nI'd personally recommend some 2-3 hour bus rides to small towns near these cities. I agree, long bus rides are miserable. I did buses from Lima to Cusco and it was incredibly draining, not to mention how risky it is.\n\nThis one month trip might give you a nice taste for Latin America to let you know if you want to spend more time there later.\n\nHave fun!",

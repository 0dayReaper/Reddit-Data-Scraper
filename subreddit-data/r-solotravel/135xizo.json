    "postText": "I'm getting ready to go to Vietnam in about 2 months and had a pre-travel consultation at my health clinic (in the US). The doctor highly recommended the Japanese encephalitis vaccine but said it's 2 shots at $350 each in the US but it would be much cheaper if I just get it when I arrive. I'm flying into Hanoi first, but can't seem to find any clinics in Hanoi that offer it. It looks like it's pretty easy to get it in Bangkok....but before I switch up my plans and buy a ticket from Hanoi to Bangkok just for a shot, I figured it'd be wise to check on here and see if anyone can recommend a clinic in Hanoi that offers this vaccine. Thanks so much!",

The chances of you getting it as a traveler are less than 1 in a million. \n\nYou need to get the vaccine BEFORE you travel as the doses are a month apart and the second dose needs to be at least a week before you travel to actually build up immunity.",

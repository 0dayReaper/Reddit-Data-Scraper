General consensus is that since it\u2019s unconstitutional to shut down inter-state travel and we aren\u2019t going to see a vaccine till Jan-March 2021 (not counting time it would take to vaccinate the whole nation), that the overarching message should be risk mitigation. \n\nRisk Mitigation means understanding the risk that you take every time you leave your house and mitigating it by wearing a mask, washing your hands frequently, and maintaining 6 ft distance from people in hopes that it keeps hot spots/case outbreaks relatively centralized to certain venues (like a bar that doesn\u2019t follow 6 ft protocol and can then get a call from environmental health or a family/small social group that isn\u2019t wearing masks and can have contact tracing done relatively easily on them). At this rate many scientists and epis are coming to the realization that Americans won\u2019t stay at home for the next 6 months so this is our best shot at doing infectious control. \n\nFlying is a relatively high risk; however, with these measures incorporated and a 14 day quarantine and monitoring of symptoms upon landing the risk can be mitigated. Car travel is safe if done independently or only with your family nucleus and if staying 6ft apart from others at the beach and using a mask when you can\u2019t helps a family stay sane for the rest of the summer then that is just a risk that we are going to have to take (the mental health impact of this pandemic is also another angle to consider when restricting people\u2019s movements... but that\u2019s a whole other post). \n\nHope this helps! Wear a mask and wash your hands! And don\u2019t forget the 6ft rule!",

Give it a few more months until the numbers are way way down and a vaccine is just about done, then come see us next spring!

In my country everyone has been traveling for the last month very responsibly and we haven\u2019t had any increases in the virus. In fact it\u2019s continuously decreased. I flew to an island a couple days ago and I\u2019m on the beach now. I had to complain to the airline for seating me in a row with 3 people but they gladly moved me to an empty row. I don\u2019t think they have changed their seating algorith at all but there were enough open seats in general to accommodate. Also I feel better solo traveling where I barely interact with anyone, especially not older people. If I was locked down at home with my parents for example I\u2019d have way more concern just going to the store and back than I do hopping on a plane and staying in a hotel alone. Some people have comfortable home lives, but I lost my job from the virus and my rent was too high for me without a job. I found a workaway on this island and I\u2019m doing a bit of volunteering. Wear your mask, wash your hands, and avoid contact. You can travel if you are responsible.",

Every country and region experienced the pandemic differently.\n\nI live in Greece and the country went to lockdown early in March and after a few consecutive days of no cases in May they gradually reopened. Now the Greek government and the Greek people made sacrifices and acted responsibly in spring; because they wanted to be open for tourism in the summer. Their sacrifice and attitude paid off: Now hospitals are not overflowing, health workers are not overtaxed, no supply shortage, easy access to immediate care items... So if somebody on this sub asks me \"Should I come to Greece?\" I will say yes, and give advice. Not just advice on where to go or what to do; but also where they can buy masks and cleaning supplies and which restaurants &amp; cafes enforce social distancing, which beaches would be less crowded, so on and so forth.\n\nDifferent places, different positions on the \"safety\" and \"normalization\" balance.",

The thing I\u2019m scared of most is tourists bringing covid to developing economies with poor healthcare infrastructures. If you travel, at least go to places with decent healthcare systems that can handle the impact of you bringing covid to more people.\n\nOr, better yet, if you\u2019re lucky enough to have income, take the remainder of 2020 (at least) as a chance to save money for big trips once you\u2019re vaccinated. Use this subreddit to daydream about those trips without necessarily booking your tickets right away. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re in a country that\u2019s reopening. Encourage your governments to provide more relief money to the industries hardest hit, rather than rushing to start moving people around too much again.

I live in a place where corona is relatively contained and the boarders are closed to nonessential travel. I know that Embassy help would be very limited if I ran into problems abroad. To me, it\u2019s just not worth the risk",

The public will choose \"no travel, no lockdown\", the politicians will be forced to implement it.",

There isn\u2019t a vaccine yet.\u201d As a relatively young avid traveler, I understand the love for traveling completely. I was close to buying tickets before the pandemic hit. I have to value my health and the others around me even if I don\u2019t know most of those people. One could already spread it to others before deciding to self-isolate. Or even if they\u2019re traveling to less crowded areas, they\u2019re still inadvertently promoting the idea that the pandemic is a small issue.\n\nThere\u2019s also uncertainty in regards to travel restrictions. I\u2019ve seen people here say they got stuck because they were traveling when Covid starting hitting other countries. It can definitely happen again. The disease is constantly fluctuating, countries thinking they\u2019re doing okay until it gets worse again and they have to take steps back again. It\u2019s very unwise to travel for leisure right now.",

So far during the pandemic i have  traveled twice through multiple states. \n\nFirst trip,  day we left California they had shut down, as we drove and stayed overnight in hotels both Laughlin, Nevada and somewhere in New Mexico before arriving in Colorado at our friends home. Colorado went into shutdown the day before we arrived. (Basically drove through 4 states to do a stay a home order in Colorado). Trip ended early and our Vegas weekend on the way back never happened. \n\nSecond trip was in Arizona. My best friend and I did dispersed camping (campsites 50+ yards separated from one another and no utilities (showers and bathrooms shared), we had to go to grocery stores to go to the restroom and always did take out with masks on. People in Arizona gave us weird looks for wearing the masks since they had reopened earlier than California at this time. \n\nI then went into work as my waiter/server job where we had to *share* face shields while wearing our masks and gloves. Well those shields were supposed to be sanitized but really all people did was spray and wipe or not clean them at all. So all of us were reusing the same face shields as someone in the day shift and night shifts, clearly going to have a higher chance of exposure that way. I then had a cough and dizziness the following Monday/Tuesday. Tested and confirmed positive by the end of the week. \n\nI just completed my self isolation in my room after having very mild symptoms and displaying none any longer. My family household still feels uncomfortable and did not want me in the house still fearing im \u201ccontagious\u201d even after three different doctors claimed I\u2019ve recovered and am not. Either way I\u2019m traveling again this upcoming Monday. \n\n\nI\u2019m camping again by myself at two campgrounds. The first has no potable water, vault bathroom and no showers. I\u2019m car camping in my vehicle. Doing some hiking trails and reading my book at my campsite. \n\nSecond campground I believe shut down their showers but even if they are opened they are cleaning them 3x a day to be preventative. Again I\u2019ll be alone car camping and visiting the beach/golf courses to just get fresh air and walk around. \n\nMind you I\u2019ll still be wearing my mask, I\u2019ll still practice social distancing. The counties I plan to visit, i will either order takeout/delivery as well as cook my own food to not be near others. I\u2019ll be using gloves every time I touch a gas station pump along with wiping the handle down with a sanitizing wipe too.\n\nI will not be visiting any other country at this time until a vaccine is out and we can handle this virus better. I will not be at the bars, dine in restaurants, clubs or anything probably until next year is there is a successful vaccine. \n\nIn all I think if someone is going to travel, we can\u2019t stop them but only inform them of what steps they can take to be careful not just to themselves but more importantly others around them. I understand I\u2019ll catch slack for doing this but when you\u2019re family kicks you out for another short period of time even after isolation where am i supposed to go? I\u2019ll be donating my antibodies to a blood drive as well to help those less fortunate.",

They let people in the country but everyone wears masks everywhere and they make you quarantine 14 days once you arrive to the country. It\u2019s been pretty much normal life in taiwan according to all my Taiwanese friends. So I plan on moving back there this fall. I do think there is a big difference from traveling to another country and moving to another country tho",

Unless you're travelling to Taiwan for a month or longer you're going to spend a huge chunk of your trip in your hotel.\n\n(Again, I don't object to what they're doing, but since we're in a travel sub I wonder what travelers think of this policy and how it affects whether they go to a place like Taiwan or not.)",

Small towns have a smaller healthcare infastructure that can be easily strained and you could have potentially put a lot of people at risk. Your county in Michigan might have less then 50 cases but what about the people you encountered at the airport or sat next to on the plane? The safest practice would have been to stay home and only travel in case of an emergency. Unless you are willing to quaratine for two weeks upon arrival you should be considerate of the locals and stay home.",

I do understand that a lot of countries depend on tourism, though. Maybe it will be better because people like me are staying home so there are fewer tourists in places and the people who do travel get to have places more to themselves lol which is safer than if everyone was traveling",

If you're not familiar with WFPB, it's basically focused on plant based foods, and no oils.  \n\nUsually, I just buy groceries before I get to my lodging and prepare my own meals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it's a long shot, but it can't hurt to ask.",

The waiter said he drank a shot of olive oil before every meal, which I found fascinating. The waiter said it was common around that area, and a high consumption of olive oils was a big reason why so many people in that village lived so long. \n\nIt stuck with me. I don't drink it straight, but I did increase the amount of good quality olive oil I use in my diet.",

Emotional exchanges and dialogue contribute to their mental health. The elders are very well respected by all here, unlike elsewhere.\u201d\n\n&gt; The introduction of a\u00a0more varied diet and the replacement of lard with olive oil brought further improvements, the researchers added.\n\n\nif you combine that with one of my favorite ted talks,\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness/\n\nyou might get some interesting insight on life-expectancy drivers",

Even as a vegetarian there are places I have traveled where I have eaten a pretty repetitive and restricted diet and one that doesn\u2019t really represent the national cuisine. I\u2019m fine with that but would not expect to find a foodie tour in places where vegetarianism is a complete foreign concept. I\u2019m just happy to find a few things I can eat!",

You meet up at the destination, usually somewhere coastal or island based.  They make buffet style PB meals on the boat and you can tour the locations where you dock.  \n\nThe other place is all US based, and they have a similar style \"base\" where a chef makes the meals and you can go off and visit the place.  \n\n  \nSo, not really a local foodie style vacation, but it's an option.",

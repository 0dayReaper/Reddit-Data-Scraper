    "postText": "I am looking to go on a solo trip in August, I am 32F and have put it off for years because everyone keeps saying \"if you wait till next year I'll go with you!\" and next year never comes!  \nSo I am looking to go for 3 weeks, starting in Budapest and working my way across to bern.  \nI love old buildings and history so I am super excited to see all the castles! Let me know if there is somewhere else I should see or add a day somewhere! \\*Also looking to see if I should avoid any areas which may not be safe for a solo female to walk around in! -which I am working on doing more research on before booking all my hostels!\n\nBudapest 3 nights  (flight in)  \nBratislava 1 night  \nVienna 5 nights  ---St Stephen's Cathedral, Schonbrunn Palace, Jewish history tour and Holocust Memorial   \nSalzburg 2 nights  ---Hohenwefen Castle  \nMunich 4 nights --- Nymphenburg Castle  \nFussen 2 nights --- Neuschwanstein Castle  \nBern 2 nights ---- Swiss Alps  \nZurich 3 nights (Flight out)\n\nI know there's a ton to do in Munich, Budapest and Vienna! I'm just not sure about some of the other places! I did see that there might be better cities to see in Switzerland than Zurich? Should I just skip it and see another city? I Can move my flights! I am booking my trip hopefully next week!\n\nI was trying not to do too many side stops, the planner put a lot of \"on-the-way\" stops, but I am the person that will stress out about missing the time to get back on the bus to leave the \"on-the-way\" places so I would rather stay somewhere cool overnight to relax a little more!\n\nThank you so much for the input!",

I did 5 days Budapest and 3 days Vienna and the Vienna trip was too short but Budapest was perfect. Though I included a day trip to the Childrens Railway and a hike to Elizabeth Tower on one day in Budapest.",

It's perfectly reasonable to just want to get settled into a cool city rather than try to cram in Lucerne or Bratislava or wherever as brief stops for a few hours. All of the places you are staying additional nights have plenty to keep you entertained, with the possible exception of Zurich (2 nights and a full day is plenty).\n\nThe only suggestion I would make it to consider pulling 2-3 nights together to spend up in the mountains. There really is nothing like being *in* the alps with the valley below you. Gimmelwald, Wengen or Murren in the Lauterbrunnen Valley would all work well before or after Bern. Zurich, Vienna and Munich could all spare a night to fit that in.",

Taking the cable car up the Untersberg is cool. I love the Sound of Music tour. I\u2019ll be doing a day trip to Hallstatt. I\u2019d love to do a day trip to Berchtesgaden but the Eagle\u2019s Nest is closed in the winter. There is Hellbrunn Palace nearby with its trick fountains. The Lakes District is nearby and is stunning (the SoM tour takes you to Mondsee). \n\nIn Salzburg proper you have Mozart\u2019s birth house and the house where he grew up, the cathedral, the fortress (Hohensalzburg), the abbey behind it, Mirabell Gardens, and music performances. Depending on your travel dates, the Salzburg festival might be on. Just walking around the old town is incredible - it feels like you\u2019ve stepped back in time! \n\nI rented a bike there and it was great to cycle around, down the Salzach river etc.",

I've been to most of the places on your list, but at wildly different times--some were 30 years ago and some 2 weeks ago.\n\nI just recently came back from 10 days, 9 of which were in Vienna.  I spent more time there than most for a couple of reasons... I'm older, and prefer a more relaxed itinerary, my health also prefers a more relaxed itinerary, I enjoy getting deeper into a place rather than packing more sights in, and I am a music fan (with a passion for some classical among other music), so I booked several concerts, and went to some \"pilgrimage\" sites, such as Beethoven's grave.\n\nFor someone younger with the energy to keep on the move I'd say your itinerary looks great! It looks well thought out, and the number of days/nights seems appropriate.\n\nI'd recommend taking the \"Twin Cities\" ferry from Bratislava to Vienna.  It's about the same time as the train, and still reasonably priced, plus you will see some castles on the Danube along the way.  It's not prohibitively expensive, but you will want to book that ahead to get a decent seat.\n\nIf you have a little wiggle room, I'd recommend one extra day in Bratislava.  It surprised me.  I found it charming, and relaxing, with some nice parks, (and of course there's the castle there too, looming over the old town). The old town gets pretty crowded on the weekends, especially Sundays, as the Viennese like to day-trip there when their own city closes down for holidays/Sundays, FYI. The old town is just as charming as you might hope. Although the wider city itself is somewhat worn around the edges, I found the people there to be more warm and open than in Vienna.",

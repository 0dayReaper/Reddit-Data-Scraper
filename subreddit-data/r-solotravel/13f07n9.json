    "postText": "Hey all - I am a 29/M and I am planning to go to Europe in early August for 5 days (excluding the two travel days). Given the shorter time frame, I was wondering if y\u2019all could bless me with some advice/ideas on where to go :) Please see below for a few notes:\n\n- I plan on sightseeing and being active during the day, and then will be going to nightlife/partying at night given I am single \ud83d\ude02\n- I\u2019m not too concerned about cost given i have a flight credit to use\n- I have been looking at the Mediterranean, such as Croatia. However my biggest concern is that 5 days isn\u2019t enough to \u201cenjoy\u201d being there as most sites say to visit an island for a few days and leave (Dubrovnik, Hvar, then Split).\n- Therefore, based on the above should i plan to just go to one destination for the entire 5 days? Or is it worth going to croatia (or greece or italy or something) where i\u2019d be moving from island to island.\n\nThank you very much for the help!",

Rovinj was my favorite spot, specifically. Pula and Zadar too. Slovenia was awesome to visit too if you like the outdoors.",

            "comment": "So Split is prety much the best place in Croatia to travel to islands from , its connected to every island with ferrys , and it will take you 2 h to Hvar , 2.5 h to Vis , 45 min to Bra\u010d or \u0160olta etc ..... you have ferrys going all day so you can check the timetable (putovnica.net , just place split - hvar for instance  and you will see all the ferrys that day, you can buy tickets at the jadrolinia shops in front of the ferry ).\n Do a day trip to the islands and come back to Split for the night. Keep on mind you will have to go for example :  split-hvar-split-vis-split-brac-split etc. (as the island are not well connected in betwen but they all go to Split )\nHvar has a nice nightlife but its much more expencive than Split... for going out Split still wins in my opinion. \nYou also have boat tours from Split for the blue cave or other tours that will take you to vis , and hvar , and maybe brac .... it will last around 10h but it will probably cost you around 150e (if you include blue cave tickets 18e in seson )\nYou can check all the information online and make like a mini scedule ... I hope this helps a bit .",

    "postText": "Hey guys, what an incredible sub this is, I've loved reading the stories. I'm so excited for my own adventure coming up but the airports are the thing that is stressing me out the most!\n\nI'm going to Europe in June, but because of where I live it is 3 flights to get there. First to Sydney Airport, then Dubai, then finally Prague's airport.\n\nAirports have always given me some anxiety, I think because of the sensory overload of sound/people/movement. (And of course the last international flight I did was in 2018).\nDo you guys have any stellar tips on staying calm and focused in airports? And is there any tips for packing carry-on that make the security checks go extra smoothly?\n\nI''d love for you to share your thoughts and experiences! Thank you for your time :)",

That way if security gets backed up or there are lines for the bathroom etc it\u2019s not a problem, that you\u2019re not stressed. Noise cancelling headphones are also the greatest gift you can give yourself.",

Also have your laptop/electronics somewhere easily accessible because they also need to be pulled out seperately. Wear pants that don't require a belt.\n\nNo jewelry and (if you're female) ideally wear a wireless bra. Usually it's not an issue but there have been a few times (maybe with more sensitive metal detectors?) where I've tripped the alarm, and it's pretty awkward when they come around with the wand and it only beeps around my tits. Now it's sports bras all the way for me.\n\nNoise-cancelling headphones. If you don't have them, get them.",

            "comment": "Omg how exciting!  Yeah I\u2019ve done those flights many times -  usually Melbourne to/from Paris or London - often with a Bangkok/Singapore stop-over as well.  You\u2019re doing well with just one intl transit yeey!\n\nSydney, you need to change from domestic terminal to intl, right?   Dubai it\u2019s all the same terminal but it\u2019s massive.  \n\nI always have a document waistpouch or a cross/shoulder little flat bag to keep my passport boarding passes credit cards etc in.  Put it on at home and DO NOT TAKE IT OFF your body till you\u2019re in your hotel/ accommodation at final destination.  It\u2019s THE WORST when you\u2019re constantly searching for documents or stressing out where you\u2019ve put your passport bag. And *every time* you stand up &amp; leave somewhere, stop &amp; look back that you\u2019ve not left anything behind.\n\nThere\u2019ll be a few security xrays at Dubai, so double triple check hand-luggage that you havent forgotten a metal nail file or spiky jewellery hairclips or whatever item Sydney security missed but Dubai might spot in the xray &amp; double-check or confiscate off you.  You don\u2019t need little shampoo bottles, massive toothpaste tubes, or whatevers in yr carry-on.  Get some laundry mesh bags to organize &amp; pack yr hand luggage stuff in, and don\u2019t take an old carry-on wheely case with shitty wheels that don\u2019t cooperate.  Smooth movement helps confidence &amp; reduces stress.  Comfy clothes, comfy shoes, spare pair of undies &amp; socks with plastic bag for the dirties.\n\nI always buy at the first airport (or before) one of those Crossword Puzzle magazines.  You can end up spending some time standing in lines or with delayed flight with low/no battery left on phone, so the crosswords can be calming, if you\u2019re not people watching.\n\nEvery time you get off a flight, go through a security check, get off an escalator - immediately *move to the side out of peoples way* &amp; STOP for a minute to get your bearings. Check all the signs, check yr boarding pass gate &amp; time or whatever, check that you have everything with you - and *then* keep moving.  Often I have a little snatch of song I sing to myself repeatedly under my breath if it gets hectic.  Old style - like Jimmy Barnes Forever Now or Bohemian Rhapsody or something lol. \n\nHowever long my stopover is, I *first* find where\u2019s my next boarding gate, and *then* go back for cafe or shopping or whatever.  Bkk airport, sometimes yr next boarding gate is like a kilometer away lol.  SET MY PHONE ALARM *for a half-hour before my boarding time*, just in case I lose track or fall asleep in a loooonnngggg transit wait. \n\nYou\u2019ll have a fabulous trip, good luck!",

Depending on my mood I have a calming playlist or sometimes I do something that kind of makes me tap my foot and shake my hips a little bit so I'm in a good mood. I have all the music downloaded.  I make a practice of trying to smile at the security people, and I usually leave one ear open and my music turned on low. Remember when you're going through security that you have nothing to hide, and that you've done nothing wrong. And I find that it's the lines that make me feel the worst so I always find out where my boarding place is find out where the bathroom is and then I find a place that's a little more isolated away from the crowds and hang out there. I also like to walk around the airport after I know exactly where and when I'm supposed to be... Walking around maybe window shopping or people watching can be entertaining, And stress relieving. I usually hang back and board towards the end of the line even if I have a higher position because I also find it very stressful to be waiting on the airplane before take off. Also, remember that you're on an adventure!!",

            "comment": "\nBest way to be calm is to prep ahead of time\n\nLots of it is planning related I think: \n- Passport and boarding pass info to hand easily\n- Be ready for airport security before arriving so it\u2019s less fumbling about to separate out your liquids etc. (worth checking to see what they are at each airport as sometimes you need to do double security when connecting - nothing more fun than filling up ur reusable bottle then being told to empty it at checks before gate)\n- Make sure you have anything you\u2019ll need for the whole trip to hand like snacks for airport/medications and that you know where it is so you don\u2019t need to tear the whole bag open to get to it. \n- or If you\u2019re planning to visit a lounge where the heck it is so you\u2019re able to get there quickly from departures/connections\n- A lot of airlines show connection details for the hub airports ahead of landing. you can be aware of how you\u2019re getting on from one gate to the next - this\u2019ll likely be the case for DBX - screenshot or make notes although it may change\n- Headphones - with a loooong playlist that counts as chilled to keep you settled. I like my wireless but with an adaptor for planes so I don\u2019t need to use plane companies own. \n- other forms of entertainment -  Same \u2018put them in an east access pocket/where you can find easily\u2019 rule applies here, and charging cables/power banks. Less you need to worry about having your bag open anywhere in an airport the better. \n- wear light layers so you can layer up when it\u2019s cold and remove things where it\u2019s not - and shouldn\u2019t take as much carry on space\n\n\n- also remember everyone\u2019s coming back to travel after a break - try to just remember nothings worth being that angry about when you\u2019re all in the same boat - shit start to a trip and it makes your experience less fun.",

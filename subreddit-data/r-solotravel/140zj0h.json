    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI am planning a trip to Europe. I've traveled quite a bit in America but I have never been to another country and I'm feeling slightly intimidated. I'm trying to plan, and I wanted help from more experienced travelers. I am planning for one month. Hopefully August. I am putting together a rough draft itinerary, and was looking for advice on schedule, as well possible routes or destinations, etc.\n\nBecause it's my first trip, I am struggling to balance my desire to keep it on the simple side  (esp. in terms of straightforward travel) and wanting to experience as much as I can.\n\nMy priorities, in order, are history, beauty, and weather. I want to visit big cities but also want to go to more obscure destinations if possible/feasible. Anyway. Here's what I have:\n\n1. Dublin -- I am visiting friends here. Will likely stay for around 5 days.\n2. UK (??) -- I would love to see Scotland, especially the highlands. However, England is not a high priority for me. I might do this if I have time, but I think it may be too far out of my route or take too much time from places I'd prefer. Considering flying straight to Paris from Dublin.\n3. France -- I want to spend about a week in Paris, as well as going on day trips. Need to see the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and Notre Dame. Day trips to Versailles, Giverney, and Auvers-Sur-Oise. After this I want to go to Spain. I would like to travel throughout France, but I may just take a train straight from Paris to Barcelona unless there's something really special along the way.\n4. Andorra (??) -- On the way from Paris to Spain. I don't really know anything about it, so I don't know if it's worth staying for a few days.\n5. Spain -- Since I got Spain in my head, it's become my number one priority. I know I want to stay in Barcelona and visit Palma. I want beaches. I want the Mediterranean.\n\nShould I add stuff? Move stuff around? What kind of stuff should I add?\n\nIf I stick to Dublin &gt; Paris &gt; Barcelona, that's about 15-20 days, plus a few travel days. I feel like I have time to add some other stuff, and I would like to go off the beaten trail if possible. In particular, going from Paris to Barcelona and skipping all the stuff around it feels a little painful, I'd like to hop into France's other neighboring countries, but that feels like a bit too much or too out of the way?\n\nWhat do you guys think about all of this? I really appreciate anyone who took the time to read.",

            "comment": "You could add other stops on your way to Barcelona, this way you see more places without jumping around :) Can't say much about Andorre as I've only been there in passing for the tax-free shops, but all the area around Montpellier is on your way, and I think the train actually goes near Lyon. Another option would be to take a ferry from Ireland to England and stop in London for a few days, then take the Eurostar to Paris, or go all the way to Madrid after Barcelona.\n\nOtherwise I think your timing looks good ! Head over to r/ParisTravelGuide if you need specific info :)\n\nMy advice is to book your long distance transportation as soon as you have a solid plan, the trains can get very expensive. Sales should already be open for August",

            "comment": "I took a early morning Flixbus from Montpellier to Barcelona - takes a while but so much cheaper than the train. I didn\u2019t love Montpellier, but it\u2019s a good launching point for both south France (Nice, etc) and Spain. I\u2019d also recommend Strasbourg - super cute town in Alsace. Tons of museums (also a history buff and i enjoyed them). \n\nI understand the dilemma - I often feel the same - but I think when you\u2019re there you\u2019ll enjoy having the opportunity to feel like you really know a region within a country. No way you can see all of any place, especially somewhere huge like France or Spain, but seeing the smaller cities are worth it (often less touristy and you get a different experience). I\u2019d personally try to add a few smaller places when you\u2019re in France or Spain so you can have a more diverse experience than just the huge cities. \n\nScotland is fabulous, but it does take time to get around if you want to see the Highlands so maybe another trip. Dublin -&gt; Edinburgh is a cheap and easy flight though. \n\nIf you\u2019re a history fan, I\u2019d recommend the Easter Rising Walking Tour in Dublin. Helped orient me in the city and was really interesting. If you want to do Trinity Library and the gaol id make sure to book in advance they really sell out.",

I do have one day trip planned to visit Glendalough and bike in the Wicklow Mountains. But that\u2019s near Dublin. I definitely want to see more than Dublin, but I need to figure out the logistics of traveling a few hours per day on train and decide if it\u2019s worth it.",

            "comment": "Hmm, cool!  Considering your #2, yeah either fly Dublin - Paris, or stop in London just a couple days.    Andorra, if you\u2019ll be hiking high mountains in summer then yeah, otherwise not much else there for a quick-visit tourist apart from duty-free mega supermarkets that French people from across the border go to to buy their groceries cheaper.  It\u2019s a ski resort in winter. \n\nUmm, Paris -- Barcelona, if you want to stop somewhere, Carcassonne is pretty special, ancient medieval preserved fortress town. Toulouse is ok it\u2019s nice has some historic stuff, but Monpellier &amp; Perpignan are bits of nothing much particularly.  It\u2019s hard to \u2018get off the beaten track\u2019 with only a few days.  Are you fluent in French?  \n\nIf you really do fancy seeing some neighbour countries, you could zooomm through -- Paris - Zurich by train, stay a night.  Zurich -- Milano by train, stay a night.  ((Paris - Zurich, Zurich - Milano, those train trips are only a few hours each eh.))    Milano - Genoa - Marseille by train, stay a night.  Marseille -- Barcelona by train.  Voila, you're in Spain.  At least you\u2019d have snapshot live slideshow of the Swiss Alps, a bit of Italy, the Mediterranean coast, all in 4 days lol.  \n\n But yeah, if you want to go all the way out to Palma, then you might need those days for travel to/from the islands.  And do be aware, August is PEAK European packed-out vacation time, right?  I reckon you\u2019d need to make bookings way on ahead.  \n\nEven if you just go Paris -- Barcelona direct, you\u2019ll still have an awesome trip, and it won\u2019t be a mad rush.",

I found it a cheap-to-travel country with beautiful architecture in every city I was in, accompanied with brilliant landscape and tons of history. Budapest is a very traveller friendly city; it\u2019s super walkable and safe.\n\nI\u2019ve heard Belgium is also a super beautiful country, with a huge amount of castles and good scenery. Germany too! The Rheinland is great.",

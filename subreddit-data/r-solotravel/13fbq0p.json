    "postText": "Like many of you I left it all behind - job, home, car, etc - to move away and travel the world and find a new purpose in life. Several months in I've realized what I really want is simply to be near my family. I've travelled enough, I'm sick of tourism; I'm done and I want to go home. \n\nProblem is that I feel like there's no life for me at home any more. \n\nI don't want to return to my old career. I can't think of an alternative one to pursue. The thought of having to sleep on friends couches, or move in with my folks again like a teenager seems wrong to me. And I know is be miserable if I got a job at McDonald's or something just to make rent. I'm also afraid of getting stuck in a deadend job that sucks away all my time and then I won't be able to see my family anyway. I don't know what to do. \n\nFor now I'm just travelling for the sake of it. I don't enjoy any of it any more, but I can't bring myself to return home either. \n\nCan anyone offer me some thoughts on this. I'm going crazy in a hotel room and I feel so lost. \n\n\n\n(Nsfw flair because the reddit app won't let me pick any other flair)",

            "comment": "There are important questions that you should be asking yourself. Do you feel like you\u2019ve found that purpose or meaning you were initially looking for when you decided to take this travel route in life? What is it that you\u2019re looking for? Do you think that a part of you is trying to fill some void? Are you healed? Maybe looking for the answers to these types of questions will help in giving yourself a little more clarity. \n\nWhat about traveling exactly are you sick of? I see you\u2019ve mentioned tourism, do you find your experiences to be more touristic than local? I ask this because I\u2019ve noticed a huge difference in my experiences and exhaustion while traveling when I was forcing myself to explore every day, do all the \u201ctouristy\u201d things, be on the go constantly, etc. as opposed to when I took my time, connected with locals, embraced the culture, made like-minded friends, etc. Maybe while you try to figure out a game plan to go home, you can use this time to take a step back and fully embrace your current environment. Maybe you\u2019ll end up falling in love with it, you never know. \n\nConsider staying at a hostel (many have private rooms if you\u2019re not comfortable sharing a dorm) that way you can meet more people and potentially make friends that could inspire you. A lot of hostels also host local events and do group activities like yoga, hiking, surfing and more. You could also volunteer to help maintain the hostel and you get free room and board in return. There are also plenty of FaceBook groups you can use to connect with people or get suggestions for worthy experiences at your destination. \n\nTry to stray away from tourist traps and culture, especially if it\u2019s been exhausting you. Try living as a local but also allow yourself the time and space you need to slow down, recuperate and breathe. Only then will it be a little easier for you to reevaluate and figure out your next move. \n\nAs for going home, the contradiction makes it seem more conflicting. You want to be near family, you don\u2019t want to travel anymore and you simply want to go home. But you don\u2019t want to stay with your parents, crash on your friend\u2019s couch, go back to your old career, work McDonald\u2019s and so forth. This is all valid, most of us would not want to feel like we\u2019re taking a step backwards, but doing one or two of those things might be necessary starting out and you\u2019ll just have to assure yourself that it\u2019s only temporary. I think the best thing for you to do is to communicate with your friends and family so that you can see what options you have in case you choose to stay with someone while looking for your own place. \n\nDo you have an idea of what you\u2019d like to do career wise? If you don\u2019t want to go back to your old job, take the skills you obtained and spruce up your resume. You don\u2019t have to stay in the same field just because that\u2019s where you got all your experience, that same experience and skills could be valuable for other fields. I have gone from working in retail, the restaurant industry, to event planning, fashion merchandising, medical field, teaching and now tech. It\u2019s all about how you structure and finesse your resume, how you present yourself and prepare for interviews and how you prove your capability over your credentials. Just take a look at the job market and see what catches your eye. Design your resume and cover letter around those jobs, watch videos on effective interview skills and the psychology behind it. Make sure you study the company and the position you\u2019re applying for so you can show that you have knowledge of their concept due to how eager and interested you are in working for them specifically; network as much as possible and so forth. This has all worked for me and gotten me a foot in the door for every industry I\u2019ve wanted to try and I don\u2019t even have a degree. \n\nI feel as though people forget that we have more control of our lives and destiny than we give ourselves credit for. You could potentially virtually apply, interview and secure a job before you even head back home. Maybe staying with your folks temporarily is a smart move so that you can financially recover from your travels and save up for your own place. Have you also considered a remote career? Maybe you can find a remote job, or freelance remotely, and can start wherever in the world you are. This will give you more freedom and flexibility. You could go to Mexico, Colombia, Thailand, or somewhere cheap and get a luxurious private apartment for a month or two where you can live and work remotely while saving up money and figuring out what you want next in life. In the meantime you could meet lifelong friends or maybe even the love of your life. You never know, you just have to be 100% open to your environment and new experiences. \n\nYou could go home and stay with family and use that opportunity to fully decide if being back in your usual environment is what you really want before committing to a lease or mortgage. If you change your mind, you can leave again and at least you\u2019ll have peace of mind that you can take your remote career wherever you want. \n\nWorld travel isn\u2019t for everyone, a lot of people are perfectly happy and content settling in one place and that\u2019s okay. Maybe this whole wanderlust lifestyle isn\u2019t for you or maybe you haven\u2019t been doing it right. Who knows. All that matters is that you try to figure these things out amongst yourself. Be open to journaling, speaking to a therapist, being vulnerable with friends and family that you trust, meditating, reading self help books, listening to inspiring and motivating podcasts\u2026just anything that will help you with getting in touch with yourself and obtaining the enlightenment you need to figure out what it is that you want in this life. \n\nApologies for the long response. I just know what it feels like to feel alone and lost. I hope there was at least some consolation or significance in my words. Would love an update if you\u2019re open to sharing. Otherwise, good luck!",

Why did you leave all behind? (Not asking, that\u2019s your business, but ask yourself). Did you take a needed break or did you sever connections to your past and roots? If the latter, then the road is treacherous but pretty simple as you already know you can\u2019t/won\u2019t go back. If the former and you feel the need to go back then just go back. But you might be experiencing some totally normal travel fatigue. I would suggest doing things completely different than tourist stuff or whatever you are currently doing. Anything different than what you are doing now. Get an apartment, cook and do laundry and watch netflix, slow down. Or go to hostels or try to create a connection to some place. Even if you don\u2019t see any future there. Then look at this with a clearer or just different point of view/mindset. Best of luck and in any case remember that whatever the future holds for you, what you have experienced is unique, yours and yours alone",

Put your pride aside, there's no shame in getting help while you get back on your feet. But you gotta figure out what you need from life. Service to others? Caring for animals? Find something that fulfills you. Easier said than done, I know. That's why therapy might be a good call, talk it out with somebody.\n\nI struggle to fit into what the world expects of me, I'm autistic. I don't find traditional success of a high paying job, and a big fancy home as fulfilling. I'm still trying to figure it out. But aimlessly roaming the globe wasn't it for me either. I love experiencing foreign lands and cultures and flavors and sounds, but if I'm not helping others, I feel useless. I'm 36 and staying with my parents right now til I figure it out. And I am so grateful that I have them and the privilege to be with them while I figure it out. \n\nI'm sorry you're struggling. I hope you find some peace and clarity \u2764\ufe0f",

I\u2019m sure your travel exhaustion is impacting your life outlook; find a few days or a week to settle in one place and don\u2019t leave unless you have to. My husband and I know that for every 2-3 days we have activities planned, we need a day where we stay in a private room and order in. Everyone has a different \u201cstimulation\u201d tolerance. We also know we prefer to avoid or do short stays in tourist locations for the most part. You\u2019re just figuring out what works for you and more trial and error is needed to narrow it down.",

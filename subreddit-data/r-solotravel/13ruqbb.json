    "postText": "I know it might be easy because everyone here is biased, but I do need some opinions because I am doubtful. I am a 22 year old female from the USA and I just graduated college 2 weeks ago. I do not have a full time job secured and my lease for my apartment in the city I went to college in ends at the end of July.\n\n Many people who I know are saying they are struggling to find a job and everyone also keeps talking about a recession. I go to school in a large city and I love it there, but I don't want to live there if I have to work a service job. I also have no desire to move back to my hometown for many, many reasons. I love traveling and it is the biggest thing in life I am looking forward to. I do not think I'm ready to settle into a full-time job yet where I only get 2 weeks paid vacation and basically have no time to go anywhere or do anything.\n\nReally the only thing holding me back is my own fear and the potential to be behind in my career. I can afford it, I don't have a partner or anyone holding me back. My top choice to do the visa would be Ireland but I would love Australia as well. I don't think my parents will want me to do this at all, however I think it's the only thing I have going for me. I would love to hear anyones thoughts, opinions, comments, regrets, etc.",

Do you have any previous experience working or interning?\n\nI traveled after college and loved every second. I did a poor job planning out my career and figuring out what I wanted to do, so I jumped around between jobs over the last few years.",

Unless you can get the job quickly I would be applying a month or two before you arrive with a tipped backup easy job (these jobs  are great because tips offset a low paying one) set up in case you can\u2019t get a full time job. \n\nIt won\u2019t be fun, but you should be applying throughout your trip and more toward the end of your trip. \n\nI have a cousin who graduated from UCLA and was highly sought based on her amazing internships who could get a job at $100k within a few weeks. \n\nI had another cousin who graduated from UW with limited experience and had to apply like crazy and I think only makes like $50k. \n\nThe point I\u2019m making is the country we live in is very expensive. I don\u2019t know enough about you and your degree but it could be easy for you to get a good paying job when you return back or it could be extremely difficult. My hope is it\u2019s not difficult but it\u2019s tough when you\u2019re applying places and it\u2019s not going well and/or your working a job you hate.",

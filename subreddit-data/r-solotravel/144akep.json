    "postText": "I am worried I just got scammed but I\u2019m not sure entirely. I went to a shop in a small town in Ireland and the guys credit card machine was not working so he asked if I could make the payment through their website online. \n\nI almost paid cash but I didn\u2019t have the full amount so said yeah sure. \n\nThen did it and now I\u2019m worried the machine is going to keep track of my card details or something? \n\nOr am I just paranoid. I used my travel card so it\u2019s not all my money but would be a bit in the shit if it did get scammed.",

If they do, you can call your credit card company to deal with the issue, though doing this from abroad may come with some disadvantages/annoyances especially if you don't have a second credit card you can use for booking things.",

Like I\u2019m traveling and a friend wants to send me money to help buy something for him, I will just give him the link to my website and ask him to pay through that. Anyway, like the other comments suggest, you can always check into your account to be sure.",

It is a physical location so easy to track and report. You could check the website's security features like certificates to ease your mind. Google should give you several lists to help verify.",

I would have just asked where the atm is or something.\n\nGood thing you used your travel card though. \n\nThese scammers tend to wait a long while before they try to use the card though so it's not obvious, so you may have time. I would still monitor it and maybe use another card or something. Just assume this one has been compromised.",

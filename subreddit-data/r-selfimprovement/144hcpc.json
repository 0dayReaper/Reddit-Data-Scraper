Just knowing your surroundings and where people/ things are can help you be primed to react.\n\nYou can only do so much vs the unexpected but when you know what's around you that is already more than most people care to pay attention to.\n\nThink of a tourist in a crowded area, if you were gonna rob someone is it the guy lost in his phone looking at maps or the one that is scanning his surroundings and alert?",

If it was your phone, you might have reacted in fight mode too, it could be the bystander effect as well. \n\nThere's a book called \"thinking fast and slow\", I'd read that and understand yourself a little more. I read it prior to that event and yeah, it changed the way I think tbh. It's worth the read. You're not a coward or anything, your brain is just wired like that. If you wanna start being more assertive, do little steps. If you get the wrong order at a restaurant, make sure to correct them politely. Practice sticking up for yourself. Your friend I'm guessing might have done this for a while now and it was 2nd nature. I lived in NYC for a while, my brother did not, that's why I think I said something. I got used to the Crazy",

I returned to the will call, but as I looked up, they had grabbed my UPS order, materials that probably were worth about $500. I ran to stop them, but they threw the materials in the back of a pickup, jumped in, and took off. I told my manager, and he had me itemize the stolen items. Our upper management had us put a gate with a lock on it at the will call dock after that, and I learned to look for only employees.",

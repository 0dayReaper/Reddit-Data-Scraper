    "postText": "I\u2019ve been doing some digging into my mind, taking myself apart piece by piece and I now acknowledge that I tend to push people away, the more they start asking about me as a person. For some reason there is a mental block in my head that pushes people away immediately when there\u2019s a topic I don\u2019t want to talk about. I can\u2019t be vulnerable to others.\n\nSome background: I am a male caregiver stuck at a dead end job. Sometimes I feel like I have given up. I have zero interest in moving up in the nursing field and really just need money because you can\u2019t survive without money. People say I\u2019m really kind and compassionate and would make a great nurse but I shrug it off. \n\nI get questions all the time about my personal life, if I\u2019m going to school, and what am I doing to better myself. Honestly, I just try to make it day to day. I don\u2019t fully know what I want and I\u2019m unsure about my path in life. But I can\u2019t tell them all that. So like always I give a non-answer and quickly change the subject back to that person.\n\nHow can I fix this mental block in my head?",

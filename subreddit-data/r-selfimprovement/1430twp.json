Maybe they tried. Maybe they did everything in their power to try to get you to notice, and you didn\u2019t. \n\n&amp; just maybe, we should start being better humans. Stop being so petty. Stop being to selfish. Start thinking about those that we walk by without noticing.. \n\nMaybe one day they\u2019ll walk past you for the last time..",

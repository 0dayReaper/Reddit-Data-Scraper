Learn to respect your past: understand that you\u2019ve made your all your decisions with your best judgement and available information at the time, and so has everyone else around you. You are who you are today because of your past. \n\n3. Learn to be grateful for tiny things: the smell of fresh cup of coffee, a new song, having a moment for yourself, learning something new...\n\n4. Dare to ask: does social media bring you joy?\n\n5. When was the last time you enjoyed yourself so much you forgot time existed? \n\n6. If you must compare, compare yourself today to yourself yesterday. See how far you\u2019ve come? Imagine how much further you\u2019ll go. \n\n7. If you\u2019re unhappy with where you are today, realize that you\u2019re only one decision away from completely changing your life. \n\n8. Breath. \nThis is your book, and you\u2019re the only author.\n\n\nEdit: whoa - thanks guys! I posted this because I\u2019m still very much in the middle of all this myself, and have been over many years. It\u2019s definitely a lifelong journey as every single line here 1-8 is 1000x easier said than done. \n\nFor those of you saying there aren\u2019t \u201cany good parts of life to hold on to\u201d, I hear you - but I\u2019d also challenge you to define what \u201cgood\u201d really means to you, without comparison to others. I know people who live in poverty and are absolutely grateful and satisfied vs people who have everything one can imagine yet completely unhappy. It\u2019s never an absolute measure, it\u2019s how we interpret things. Have the courage to challenge the status quo of this interpretation and make it your own. \n\nIf you\u2019re reading this in peace and have the time to pause for a sec and reflect, chances are you\u2019re doing pretty ok. Thanks for being present.",

Life is so busy, I find it's so hard to even find time to reflect on some of these things, and to compare myself to myself from yesterday, and to plan out.\n\nBut like Covey also says, \"You can be very busy without being very effective\"",

I optimize the joy out of any task. \n\nI think you're right about \"making time to reflect,\" which is itself a priority. How often do you make a list where you have a bunch of menial tasks, but also some like \"work on my goals, spend time reflecting, think about my relationships\" and you end up doing all the menial things but pushing out the more \"open-ended\" tasks. To me, open ended time and/or goals or objectives are so difficult to accomplish, maybe because they're so vague. I don't really know how to answer the question of \"what do you hope to get out of 'making and spending time to reflect?'\"\n\nSimilarly, how often do our open-ended answers to questions stay as \"I don't know\" to the point where we go to google and type \"reddit how do I do ____\" (at least that's what I do all the time lol).\n\nBut someone posted some very interesting food-for-thought on this sub the other day talking about how our creativity \"diminished\", and that the way to get it back is to FIRST \"ask yourself 'what can I do about this'?\" I don't practice this, but I'd like to start. Instead of going to others for answers right away, I can start exercising my creative muscles by asking myself first what can I do? How can I do it? What tools do I have or need to do this?",

I've learned over the past year or so that decision-making is the hardest thing for me, and maybe that's why \"taking the vagueness out of vague tasks\" is so important. I like your idea because it means making the decision to break down the goal further. I can't tell you how long \"work on my goals\" has been sitting in my \"To Do\" column without ever moving. And then one day when I finally do decide that \"yes, I really need to do this to make some damn progress\", the vagueness and lack of decision making shines through.\n\n\"Creating actionable steps\" is good advice as well, I will definitely have to try that. I mean it makes sense after all. If a menial task has actionable steps, then a vague one should have them as well, it may just take longer and/or more creative power to break it down more. But I suppose that by doing this, you're also exercising your creative and decision-making muscles.\n\n\"Once decisions are done I pretty much 'just' have to execute\" hahaha yeah now you can automate/optimize away :P\n\nThanks for the reply and advice, I'll have to put this into a new vague card \"Implement vagueness-reduction strategy\" :D",

For a long time, I felt like my life got pushed off track or that I wasn't where I was \"supposed to be\". \n\nI've wanted to go back for my master's in psych for years but my chronic pain made it impossible for me to seriously think about going back to school. I wanted to do something that made a difference in the world and I thought becoming a therapist was the only way I could do that.\n\nI still want to be a therapist, but I realized that I don't need to be this monumental force of altruism and positively impact a ton of people. I can make the world a better place simply by helping those in my life. \n\nI helped my best friend get his marriage back on track. I volunteer with a charity that helps advocate for chronic pain patients that can't advocate for themselves. I make it a mission to keep improving myself so I can show up for those I love as my best self. I'm definitely a work in progress!\n\nBy changing my mindset I realized I can already make a difference and help people right now.",

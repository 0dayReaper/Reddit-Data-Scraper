Unfortunately, my brain lacks clarity as much as ever.\n\nOne method I had heard of for clarity was a ruthless health regimen, so I've been eating mostly vegetarian lately and exercising more. Unfortunately, it might be too little too late. Any other tactics? Asking for advice has not helped at all; my family and social circle consists largely of fundamentalist religious people who have very deluded or warped ideas.",

When you're near the end of life, will you look back and regret doing this? Or will you regret not doing this?\n\n- if a friend you cared about were making this decision, what would you tell them?",

There are scientific studies supporting meditation\u2019s benefits. This is a time honored exercise for achieving clarity.\n\nStop eating highly processed foods. Stop eating sugar. Look into supplements like ashwagandha as an adaptogen or phage technology (caudovirales) and CBD. \n\nFinally, exercise. Do it daily but not to exhaustion. Overstressing the body stresses the mind. Stretch. Especially mind the head and neck which react and hold tension in those experiencing protracted stress.\n\nGood luck! And believe there\u2019s a lot of wonderful things happening for you in the future if you just relax, accept your work with gratitude, and just be you.",

Search online for biorhythm software.  All it's doing is counting the days since your birth and plotting sine waves.\n\nMany years ago I heard a story of somewhere in China where if a cabdriver was having a day wherein all three cycles were simultaneously at the bottom, they would fly special flags so other drivers around them would know to give a bit of extra space and compassion.\n\nDon't know about Chi.",

I take a 30 minute lunch every day during lunch to get fresh air and a break from my work, I\u2019m a software engineer so I sometimes prioritise code above sunlight. Tracking my macros and calories to make sure I\u2019m not going overboard with eating, that\u2019s an easy trap for me to fall into. I\u2019m also trying NoFap too, I can\u2019t explain it but my mind clarity and productivity sky rockets while doing that. Sounds strange but if I\u2019m not taking care of myself, I feel this level of guilt I can\u2019t shake, like I\u2019m not acting as the grown up I should be and I have no excuse because none of the things that make me feel productive are bad or require much effort.\n\nI hope you are able to find clarity and a peaceful mind to help you for the struggles to come.",

Don\u2019t encumber yourself with too many unnecessary things, life is easy to appreciate in its most basic form. The more we want things for ourselves, the more likely we are to be unsatisfied with not getting them.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to over complicate things, keep it simple.\n\nMay the circumstances be in your favor :)",

More importantly, bounce them off a mentor or two to gain some seasoned wisdom and insight.\n\nRegarding diet, fish is a \"brain food\" and can help you feel more mentally alert.",

People who know you well can offer points you hadn't thought of, but only you know what's best for you. If I have a huge decision to make, I take a lot of alone time and I journal and I make lists. I love lists. If the decisions are as big as you say, I'd spend some time writing down things you really value. Figuring out your values and core beliefs, if you aren't already aware of them, are great for pointing you in the right direction. Because what's great for someone else or great on paper, won't necessarily be great for you. Values and beliefs, in my opinion, play a HUGE role in one's life decisions. And it makes it all the easier to make those decisions when you come from a place of knowing yourself. It's hard to KNOW know yourself, but at least taking note of the things you value most and going from there.",

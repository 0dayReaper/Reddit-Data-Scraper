How can I get GOOD friends there?",

That will drain your energy and waste your time if you are looking for real friends.",

There are classes, clubs, and activities galore, that will place you in social situations with people who have also gone out of their way to be engaged in the exact same thing.  Find some of those, and find ones based on things you have true and genuine interest in, and the social connections pretty much design themselves.",

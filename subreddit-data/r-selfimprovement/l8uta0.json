It's more like \"well just because I'm hopeless doesn't mean I can't be as helpful to others as possible.\"\n\nAnd before you say \"oh well nobody's hopeless, everybody deserves love.\" I'm aware, and I've given up on that, too much baggage that's unfair to subject others too, especially those who care about me,, when I'm the only one that can really fix it and so far that hasn't worked. I have plenty of friends and family and all sure, but that doesn't mean I don't find myself despicable. I try my best to be the best me I can be, courteous, empathetic, etc, driven by self hatred.\n\nSo far it's worked out, getting farther in my education and my career because of the unhappiness, the self loathing gets me out of bed, through the day, and to sleep. My only comparisons come from thoughts like \"someone's being raped right now begging for it to stop, and has to live with that, but I can't spend 3 hours a day studying or putting in a little effort to maintain a steady diet/exercise routine? How worthless am I?\" And I thrive off of that, I won't act like I'm happy, but I've got a 3.7 GPA on track to medical school, and I'm fairly good at my hobbies like drawing etc, so overall I can't complain.",

Reading and learning philosophy really helped me with that, but how you veiw yourself and others is all about perspective. Self love and compassion holds you to higher standards than self loathing or whatnot ever can. Deal with reality on realities terms, acknowledge the terrifying dragon thats constantly breathing down your neck, turn towards it, and kill it by embracing it. You cannot ever truly love someone until you learn to truly love yourself. Look at it this way. You have a lamborghini. You can either buy good fuel and oil for it, or buy shitty fuel and oil. Good fuel and oil will have your lambo lasting alot longer and you can feel your cars happiness as you drive it. With bad fuel and oil your car degrades, feels less alive, etc., and no matter how often you acknowledge that your car is a lamborghini and that its badass, your shitty fuel will always hold back your perception of the Lamborghini because of how bad it runs. The type of fuel matters.",

You don't have to pepper it in self-love slogans, but you do need to respect and care for yourself.\n\nIf you want to help make the world a better place - you've gotta be in a better place. Otherwise you will not meet your full potential, and thereby fail the very people you wish to be successful for.\n\nYou know those airplane safety videos that clearly state to secure your own oxygen mask, or fasten your own lifevest, before helping any other passengers? An unconscious person simply is no help to anyone, and adds additional danger to the situation - now someone else has to save them too.\n\nIf you have a hard time being good to yourself try being good to your future self - the one you are working your ass off to become. Do plenty of favours for that person, be super kind to that person, and hopefully one day you will become one in the same.",

My dad was easy to piss off when he was stressed so we had to walk on eggshells but at the same time when he was in a good mood he was the coolest dad in the world. You think that has to do with it? And thankss for the book rec! I'll def add it to my reading list. I'm almost 30 btw idk if that's relevant.",

I would focus less on whether yo have it or not, just browse and see if you can relate. There are some good sources in the sidebar on things like \"how to deal with an emotional flashback\".\n\nWhat you're describing can 100% cause dysregulation of the nervous system of a child. The whole \"walking on eggshells\" thing. \n\nWhat helped me is learning that trauma isn't about what happens to you but how you deal with it.",

Can anyone think of a single instance where hate was ever useful? We are Spiritual beings. Our Spirit, lives, grows, and feeds off of Love. Not hate. \n\nHate is where all the bad things derive from. Racism, sexism, and all the other ism's all start with hate.  \n\nIf you really want to make a change within you learn how to \"Love\". It isn't easy. You must forgive those who caused you harm. You must face your own short comings. You must sometimes be the bigger person. \n\nTry it!",

I would say you can\u2019t hate yourself and do nothing about it and become anything different than you already are. But a little bit of self-hate is a good thing once you\u2019re completely satisfied with who you are and what you are and how you look at all that well then you stop growing and you\u2019ve lost. It\u2019s over because you\u2019re not fighting anymore for anything you\u2019re just complacent so I hate that last one percent body fat I need to get rid of I hate it until I\u2019m done getting rid of it and then I\u2019m gonna hate the next 1% or something else . Just a different way that I look at it felt like sharing. Cheers",

It's widely practiced in many industries - even hospitals and offices. But no one was using it for their house. \n\nTo me, that's impossible to ignore. So I balled with it and as predicted, it worked. I have a system for virtually any chore.\n\nDomesticles comes out when there's work to be done and he *sneers* at the idea of leaving work behind. He works tirelessly to accomplish what needs to be done.",

We're literally fighting for nothing.\n\nSo I'm gonna side-step all this bullshit and tell you if you're the man you claim to be, thats something to be admired.\n\nI admire that you've got your recipe and you're sticking to it. You've got a strong identity.\n\nAnd if you're on the path to being that man, I admire that, too.\n\nI do disagree with gender roles, not for any political reason but because their value doesn't make sense to me.\n\nI approach the world with great curiosity and a nose for opportunity. To me, it's quite interesting that kaizen is enormous in the business world but I can't find a single reference of someone using in their house.\n\nIf I could develop a system that eliminates hundreds of hours of housework a year and makes the job virtually stress-free, the potential gains far outweigh the losses. \n\nAnd just as you don't believe in outsourcing the work, neither do I. I gotta experience it firsthand.\n\nIt sounds like you have a lot of firsthand experience, too. Again, I admire that shit and recognize that it's got you feeling good.\n\nAnd ironically, this kinda jousting makes my inner world roar with pleasure, even though I regret it later.\n\nMaybe we should stick to the wood-cutting. \n\nI use a 40\" maul. . I line that shit up, raise the maul, and apply the force just before it connects. Fucking blows that wood apart. My buddies call my style The Drop of Doom.\n\nI can cut for hours but I usually run out of rounds.\n\nSo I started throwing axes instead. Built a board, ordered a couple Cold Steel's on Amazon, and just learned.\n\nIt gives the same primal sense but lacks the punch of wood-cutting.\n\nIf you haven't tried it, you should!",

No. \n\nThat's because they are biologically less suited to doing that work than you or I. It's the same as getting up on a bus so an old guy can sit down, or helping a short person get something from the top of the shelf at a grocery store. \n\nSo if you make a list of all the shit that needs to be done, and then order it from *most physically demanding* to *least*, and you're going to do the items on the list with a less capable partner... how are you going to split the tasks?\n\nMaybe there's enough hours in a day for you to do all of the tasks, but if your partner *can* and does the last one... it will result in both of you having more free time *together*.\n\nSo if you're happily married, and you want to maximize the amount of free time you have together, then you'll both work on burning through the chores to get them done ASAP.\n\nThis will mean you starting with the most physically challenging tasks and her starting on the other end of the list, and both working until you're done. \n\nIf one person is doing the entire list, it's the sign that something fucked up is going on... one person is taking advantage of the other. \n\nThat's why it matters. If you're doing chores 6hrs a day after being at work for 10hrs and your wife is just watching YouTube all day... that's bullshit. If *she's* working 10hrs a day to make enough money to hire another man to come do the shit you're not doing while you play video games all day... that's bullshit too. \n\nBecause we're all humans, we all live at the same time, we have similar lists of chores that need to be done. This makes it possible to compare and contrast and assess whether a relationship is healthy, or if someone is perhaps taking advantage of the other. \n\nEven if you apply Japanese industrial management practices to burn through your chores in a third of the time, it would still be bullshit for *just you* to do them all instead of splitting it.",

It's a job you do nightly for a week (can you even call it a job? Splitting firewood is awesome) and you have enough wood for the season.\n\nMulch and patching the roof are basically one-off jobs as well.\n\nEverything else you listed (dishes, laundry, and vacuuming) are jobs that you have to do every day/week for eternity. There's significantly more effort and hours going into running the household.\n\nI choose to do the heavy jobs plus my share of the lighter jobs.",

I think my teens was when I was comfortable enough to joke about it, one friend was calling me gay for wearing sunglasses when I drove and I had an epiphany that nothing's gay about it. I like being safe when driving because it improves my life the same way folding clothes improves yours. Imagine giving up both those things because you didn't want to \"look gay\". \n\nBLUF: You may not be able to change how homophobes feel about an action, but you can control how you react to their snarky comments. If they bother you, they'll keep doing it. I remember I joked \"stop, my boyfriend got it for.our anniversary...your dad\" and we laughed a bit, but he never made a joke about it again because he was just trying to get a reaction out of me",

I never really dated or showed much interest in women, I expressed myself in a primarily feminine way, I took great interest in things like art and fashion, etc. Now, in my case, I had actually come to realize and accept the fact that I am a bisexual man. I did not realize, nor accept this about myself until around 3 to 4 months ago maybe.\n\nBefore then, I had wholeheartedly believed myself to be a straight man. And as a straight man, I had always been viewed as gay, so I understand what that feels like. For clarity, this is not me saying that you are bi or anything, just giving context.\n\nWhat helped me then, and now, is to deconstruct society and its norms. Sounds like a daunting task but in reality it can be done in one simple change of perspective. From now on, I do not look at anything as \"manly\" or \"womanly.\" I look at things as \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" and understand that ALL things contain a combination of the two expressions.\n\nThe expression of the self through emotions and whatnot is not a womanly thing to do. It's a \"feminine\" thing to do. Working out hard with all the grunting and yelling is not a manly thing to do. It is a \"masculine\" thing to do. See where I am going with this? As a species, we only feel comfortable when we have a compartment to put everything in; a category. This is what I like to call \"stupid.\"\n\nSexuality only does ONE THING, it tells you who you want to fuck, and who you want to romantically love. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. Accept and nurture the masculine aspects of yourself, just as much as the feminine aspects. Those two parts of the self make up the wholeness of yourself. Find pride and joy in that.\n\nHope this helps",

Had a friend everyone was calling him gay he was adamant about not being gay and i was supportively dismissing people saying it etc ...turns out he was suppressing it trying to fit in etc.\n\nOn the other hand of course you could be simply straight.",

People's thoughts and judgments can't be controlled (but they can be influenced, that's as close as it gets). You can control your mind and not caring.

I don\u2019t know you in real life so the reason I\u2019m saying that is because I know people that talk like women and have feminine mannerisms and I questioned if they was gay or not. People can sit up here and say to me under this comment \u201cwhy does someone\u2019s sexuality matter to you\u201d and \u201cmaybe you\u2019re just insecure about your masculinity\u201d and all these new age responses as if they themselves have never done it but let\u2019s face it, as human beings we can\u2019t help but be curious. Cuz honeslty when you said someone asked if you was gay for folding clothes the first thing that came to my head was it\u2019s probably your movements and mannerisms as you folded the clothes. Have you grown up around a lot of women? Cuz we emulate the behavior of those around us as we grow up. Just my two cents. Hope I helped.",

Your happiness and self-care should always be a priority.\n\nWhen I was younger, I was conditioned to put others' needs before mine, which created a cycle of self-neglect. Like you, I was drawn into situations that felt energetically wrong, resulting in a deep disconnect from myself. \n\nLoving oneself doesn't mean you love others less; it simply means you're learning to refill your own cup before pouring out for others. \n\nYou can't pour from an empty cup, after all.",

            "comment": "Sounds a lot like my life story. Raised in a strict, repressive household. Not allowed to make my own decisions or ask the 'wrong' questions. Any windows to the world outside of my household or school were tightly controlled and restricted.\n\nI ended up living life in a fog, wracked with guilt for and fear of the consequences of not living up to others' expectations. I was deeply unhappy and insecure, but to those in my life who were supposed to be unconditionally supportive, that was 'normal' and how I was supposed to be, so how was I to know any better?\n\nI started turning things around in my life after I turned 20 because I realized the way I was, I was headed nowhere fast. It was more of a gradual change than sudden and there were occasions where I fell back into old people-pleasing patterns  but overall I have been happy for most of my adulthood because I was living for myself and not others. \n\nLove and accept yourself first, and good things will come of it. You will in turn earn the respect of others.",

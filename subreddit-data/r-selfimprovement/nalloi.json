    "postText": "It's funny how at 15 you have this idea of a \"cool adult\" that still parties all the time, has hundreds of popular friends and owns all the expensive stuff, and I see so many people my age (early 20's) subconsciously still chasing the idea of being that person (including myself up until recent years). I feel like a lot of us let insecurities from our teen years still sway many of our life choices, even if we aren't getting any happiness out of it. After everything I've experienced and learnt from life since that age, I know now that the person I wanted to be back then sucks, and the lifestyle I wanted for myself was superficial, lonely and meaningless. Sure, you can always \"grow up later\" but I believe if it's something you won't be proud to still be doing when you're 30 that doesn't bring some form of meaning to your life, you shouldn't waste your time doing it now. Get a head start on being someone you will be proud of when you're 30, rather than chasing who you wanted to be at 15.\n\nEdit: For anybody over 30 feeling left out, I just wanted to say that 15 and 30 were just ages I randomly chose because I'm in between those ages. You can choose whichever ages apply to you. My point is nobody should feel old, because we shouldn't be looking through the lenses of our younger selves. We should instead be looking through the lenses of our older selves, realising the time we have left and doing what that person would be proud of, regardless of if that's 40, 50, 60, 70 and so on.",

I sat around gaining nothing but weight for the last ~20 years, wasting the best years of my life, and now that I've finally recognized there's a problem, I feel like it's too late to change anything for the better... but I'm still trying. The only alternative to trying is to give up and end it... and I'm too much of a coward to even do that. \n\nAny young people out there who happen to read this, use me as a warning.",

I was an addict for years that started with an eating disorder in college. Cutting out these, especially artificial sweeteners, literally changed my life. \nAgain, I know this sounds fucking ridiculous in this kind of thread, but I\u2019m telling you, it WILL help you. The food we eat is our fuel to live. The importance of that last sentence cannot be overstated.\n\nEdit: also, I\u2019m 31, 6\u20191\u201d and 235lbs lean, you don\u2019t need high protein diets.

It will only cause more suffering and baggage on others. On the other hand, to aspire to be a family man is a noble pursuit. If nothing motivates you, focus on that. How? Well... ensure yourself a living, focus on being the one instead of finding the one, perhaps online dating or getting enrolled in a course to meet new people, and keep on going.

Read \u201cSilence\u201d by Thich Nhat Hanh and \u201cThe Mind Illuminated\u201d by John Yates.\n\nThe past and future only exist in your mind. All that really matters is what\u2019s happening right now. Right now your thoughts are constantly pulling you into the past and the future, and that\u2019s what\u2019s making you suffer, and making everything worse. You have to train yourself to control your thoughts. Every time you catch yourself thinking about something that makes you feel bad, acknowledge it, cut the rope, take some deep breaths, and focus on whatever\u2019s in front of you in the present moment.\n\nOur brains constantly want to either analyze the past or predict the future, because that\u2019s how we evolved. Before civilization, in the rare times we had a moment to think between fighting for survival and sleeping, we thought about how to better our chances of surviving the next day. Everything our animal brain tells us we want is a result of evolution and desire to survive. Now we\u2019re surviving, and have plenty of time to think, but we\u2019re still running the same software.\n\nSame reason we get fat; our brains tell us that food tastes good and we need more, our bodies evolved to store fat so we don\u2019t starve when we can\u2019t find food - but now we can always find food, so we have to fight with our animal brain\u2019s desires. Same with stimulation in general. We crave stimulation because it means we\u2019re exploring, hunting, learning, gaining experience, increasing our chance of survival. But now we can just watch TV or play games or (verb) social media, and we get fat mentally.\n\nMeditation trains your ability to control your animal mind. You just gotta practice consistently and realize that it takes time to see results. Think about the monks who set themselves on fire in protest, and meditated through it all without moving or making a sound. They\u2019re just humans who trained themselves from zero to stoic. No matter how bad life is right now, you\u2019re probably not actively burning to death. Their power is available to everyone, and reachable by persistent sitting.",

I was obese, 320 lbs. everything else was fine, I was a young director for a tech company and well educated and paid. I thought though that there was no point in loosing weight as I would have loose skin etc. until I went to Colombia for vacation at 25 years old and met a 46year old man in a club. He had two beautiful woman with him, he told me how he use to be obese like me and had something called a gastric sleeve done. After a year or so he performed a couple of other surgeries to get the loose skin gone and removed. Me and him lived life there, we drank fucked beautiful woman and set the city on fire. I had so much fun in Colombia and so many new experiences it changed my outlook on life. I wanted to be beautiful and I was willing to pay for the mistakes I have made in the past. I dieted heavy and hard for a year and a half, I never went through with a gastric sleeve. But I worked out and dieted to loose 100lbs in a year. I then did skin removal on my torso and chest for all under 7k in Brazil. I already had a tribal tatto on my left shoulder and I connected it to my chest to cover some scars. Now I look like a Hawaiian beach body model and I\u2019m 27 and a half years old. I still have 2 and half long years till I hit 30 and I\u2019m loving life. Get out your house, travel, gain a new mind and perspective and change your life and take what\u2019s yours. You can whine for 4 more years and then wish you would\u2019ve done it all at 30. Stop the cycle and madness and just do it!",

I think your advice does more harm than good. If you think that getting surgery and fucking beautiful women in Colombia is a great lifestyle then good for you, if that makes you happy it's great, but this is just lame and shallow and you can't come to someone that is probably battling depression and use this as \"motivation\".\nAnd \"go out and travel\".. lol , I guess it's super easy for an IT director of a (probably) first world country. Like I said, you don't know OP, you don't know if he/she has the means to travel. She could be very well a traveler blogger and still be depressed because traveling or just partying doesn't guarantee absolute happiness.",

What good is a huge mansion if you're living in it alone? As you said, all superficial crap that does not bring happiness. After I have met my girlfriend, I have realized what I really want in life. I want to have a happy marriage, kids, a fulfilling job, a house in the suburbs...you know, what others might consider boring. But I think there is a time for partying and that time is over. I need to take responsibility for myself and for my family. Raising a family, and providing a happy life for my wife and kids is so much more meaningful than any luxury items. I still want to make a good living, but I am not willing to sacrifice my health and relationships for that anymore. It is all about balance and I think I have found what truly makes me happy. Being a good husband and father, an honest human being with values that go beyond superficial cravings for luxury. Wow, this is what growing up feels like right? haha",

I missed out on a lot of great experiences because I was grinding away to prepare myself for a life that I ultimately gave up anyway. With that being said, no regrets because I realized it\u2019s never too late to accept where you are and find joy. \n\nI\u2019d say just do whatever you want to do, as long as it\u2019s not unhealthy for you. What you want changes throughout your life. Just keep going with the flow. Don\u2019t do something now to prepare for what you MIGHT want later. Just do what you want.

Hope you get where I'm coming from. Have a nice day :)",

Meaning, don't waste all your life chasing a job, skill for the sake of money.\n\nYou won't be happy. Sure you might have that stable \" life your parents wanted for you \". That type of programming and pride is only skin deep.\n\nBe a person you can be proud of even if you lose the job, the house, get divorced. If you still are happy even at what society calls rock bottom.\n\nYou will be better off. So at 15 if you wanted to play music, make art or create video games. Do it. But don't for yourself, not to be exploited by CEOs. Don't work for free or exposure. Don't revolve your life around being the superficial husband or wife.\n\nThe moment you do it's over. Because your happiness is now tied to another person's superficial brainwashed vision of happiness. And now your stuck in their broken world.\n\nThe happiness I ever was in my life was when I realized what made me happy. It was the shire from LOTR, it was Avatar the last Airbender. I looked at what in those worlds made me happy.\n\nAnd guess what? It was the simplistic day to day lives the characters had. The freedom to just walk outside. Didn't have advertising in their faces all the time. So I minimalized my life. Cut Soo many things out. And bam I was free.",

            "comment": "I agree with your point of view. I would like to add that on top of that, society's definition of being succesful is not an objective measure at all. Simply said: if you do not have \"your shit together\" at 30 or whatever age, it is ok. \n\nReaching a goal is part our work, but also include factors like economical or personal circumstances like health, background or events that impact your life. It should not be an excuse not to try something you want, but it should be taken into account realistically I think. You can focus and strive to work towards being a certain way, but it is never a static end goal in itself. \n\nThere also is no \"deadline\" you have to meet like a certain age or before a certain moment and sometimes shit just doesn't work out the way you planned. That is not failure. You change as well. Your goal, if anything, should be to enjoy your life and pursue your passions and those may be very different from when you were 15 to when you are 30 I can assure you. \n\nEvery life is different and what you want to get out of life should be the definition of success, not a vague description like \"being rich\" or \"succesful\".",

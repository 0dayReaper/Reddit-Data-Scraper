    "postText": "So I went to my car, changed out of my costume into casual wear, and went to my favorite bars in the area because the show must go on and my night was just getting started.  \n\nFolks, Friday night I met a woman at a club. She was pretty cool, I got her snap, we talked a lot that night as well as yesterday morning. I was at a meet up with the bros when she asked me to come to town to see her to bar hop and club in Halloween costumes. The bros said 100% go, so I grabbed a costume and headed out.  \n\nTwenty minutes in, she said her and her friends are using the restroom. 10 minutes later I asked her if she has been to a certain bar and got left on read. After ten minutes, I assumed I was ditched so I changed out of my costume and went to my favorite bars in the area because I was already there.  \n\nI ate good food, had some good beer, played pool, talked to some good people, and played darts. It was a good time! I did end up blocking her and considered saying something to her, but thought \"If you don't respect yourself, why should anyone else?\" And having me drive an hour to ditch me in 20 minutes meant she didn't deserve more of my time.  \n\nI used to put up with behavior like this and would forgive them, I was quite the pushover and I have since worked on this extensively. Did things go how they were supposed to? No, but I proved to myself that I respect myself a lot and that's a win in itself.\n\nMake the most out of the bad and never let somebody's shitty behavior towards you ruin your day.",

She didn\u2019t like the music so I caved and switched clubs last minute. I regret this very much. While i was trying to have a good time at the new club, she ditched me and went to some guy\u2019s VIP booth. I was devastated, went back to the hotel, turned off my phone and wept. Found out the next day, some friends showed up at the original club, lost in the confusion. I was also later cursed out by the \u201chighschool sweet\u201d for apparently ditching her after she ditched me to go to some guy\u2019s VIP booth. I struggled with my self esteem and going out in general. It took me several years to bounce back from that even though it seems so minor now hindsight 20/20. \nEdit: She didn\u2019t even realize I was gone until the club was closed at 3am in the morning.\n2nd Edit: Several years later, I met the most amazing girl ever, she made reservations at the same hotel for my birthday and made a heart-shaped pizza, which, at the time, I had never seen before.",

If every man could do this, walk away from shitty behavior, it would lessen entitled behavior some of these women have simply because they will cease to get any attention from anyone. \n\nThe only reason why these types of people exist is because they are seldom punished for shitty behavior and there is always a simp willing to put up with emotional neglect for a potential opportunity to score (which they don\u2019t anyway).\n\nAnyhow, the more men stand up for their own self dignity, and say no to low quality dates like this, the more they will empower not only themselves, but it\u2019ll also enable better behavior to their counterpart.",

You don't have the whole story, she might have had great intentions even if she didn't meet up.\n\nSince this has been downvoted I'm adding a universal lesson for anyone who's feelings got hurt. *Expect rejections in life.* Expect changed plans. Expect people to change their minds and to say no. \n\nOnce you're fine with it, life will get easier. I know it's a modernity to claim you're \"ghosted\" or \"ditched\" but seeing it that way isn't really helping your case. People will come and go people will plan up meet and people will sometimes not show up. You'll be a bit dissapointed but you are gonna be ok.\n\nIt's a practice we use in stoic teaching.

As said in \u201cThe Gift of Fear\u201d by Gavin de Becker: Men worry that a woman will laugh at them. Women worry that a man will kill them.\n\nUnderstanding that certain actions of others aren\u2019t a reflection of who you are or what they judge you to be but rather what they deem to be the safest or lowest risk course of action based on their own life experiences is a large part of the process of maturation. Feeling some type of hurt or judgement when a woman crosses the street to avoid you, or feeling hurt or confused when a woman ditches you on a date  is only natural, but try to remember their point of view: is being polite for someone you have no idea of their intentions worth the potential risk?\n\nFor any man reading this that is rolling their eyes: I get it. It can be difficult to believe life is so different for the other sex - but ask any of your female family members or friends about times they have felt afraid or threatened and they might help to paint a picture that will humble you.",

That's wrong step 1.\n\n No one owes you a respond, they can block you and never speak to you again. To block someone, to not meet up, to not respond, is a very clear \"I don't want Anything to do with you\" boundary.\n\nYou gotta learn to make your own closure on things because not all people will wanna engage. And that's their right. \n\nAnd I suggest instead of seeing yourself as ditched. See it as she changed her mind. Changed plans. That's way less passive agressive.\n\nWalk away with grace. It sounds like you just quit your shitty job. That's to walk away with pride and grace.\n\nSome online date not happening is just normal everyday life. There's no grace in accepting that.\n\nI don't know how old you are. I'm 30+ and when I was a teen, I thought people owed me their time, their explanations, closure etc. It was a very self destructive mentality because life kept happening and life includes  unexpected things.\n\nI learned that people saying no to me had nothing to do with my value. It just meant wrong match. I may sound tough with my words but my intention is to help. Some mindsets creates suffers and I'm pretty sure you avd most men feeling lonely etc, has enough of that.\n\n To have this victim mentality is to suffer twice. Let it go. Learn to let it go.",

There's literally zero way to know how he would react you are assuming his actions would be to shame the women even more.. are you sure you don't hate men? Like how could you logically come to these conclusions from what was stated in this post",

I didn't even think of it but that plays a big role too.\n\n&gt;Understanding that certain actions of others aren\u2019t a reflection of who you are or what they judge you to be but rather what they deem to be the safest or lowest risk course of action based on their own life experiences is a large part of the process of maturation.\n\nPrecisely. Finally someone mature who's worked on self improvement.\n\n&gt;Feeling some type of hurt or judgement when a woman crosses the street to avoid you, or feeling hurt or confused when a woman ditches you on a date is only natural, but try to remember their point of view: is being polite for someone you have no idea of their intentions worth the potential risk?\n\nOr she had anxiety and just froze and was too panicked to go , or she started puking because she was so wasted, or her friend started causing trouble so she made sure to take her home safely, or she had low battery on the phone and it didn't feel safe to be out without a phone, or she got a migraine, or her stalker ex found her, or literally ANYTHING else. I have no idea how people's only conclusion is \" poor me she ditched me\" of all other possible reasons. \n\nAnd even if she did ditch him, THAT'S HER CHOICE. She is allowed to change her mind, she ows men she say yes to Nothing, absolutely nothing. \n\nI get big red flag vibes from OP's reaction so I'm actually glad she didn't see him, based on his reaction, he wouldn't handle her boundaries or take no for an answer. Maybe she listened to her gut feeling that something was up with him. And the scary part is if people like OP are the 20+ downvotes I've gotten. So many men don't respect women and think we owe them something because they find us attractive and want to meet. It's horrible.\n\nMen reading this better get it to their head. Women aren't yours to claim, not her time or body. She decides, exactly who she meets and who she decides to not meet. If you have issues with basic respect, you have a lot of self introspection (and possibly need of professional help) to do.",

Most men who get called out, they lash out, they call you a slut they tell you to fuck yourself \"I hope you die\" etc  it's not worth it. She owes him absolutely nothing, nothing. She decide if she wanna speak to him again or not. And he has 1 job. To respect that. \n\nThat's why OP should be thankful for this sub and us who dare to say straight out what he can improve. We aren't in a dating scene with him. We are protected by a screen, and reddit policies if he turns out abusive. She or anyone else who matches with him don't have that safety. The only safety they have are their girl friends who can help her see that it's a bad idea to meet certain people. \n\nI have tried reasoning with OP. he hasn't shown a single interest to listen, he wanna be praised for his concerning behaviors, and all others  with the same concerning behaviors are backing him up. All I've gotten back is insults and lash outs. And this is adult people we are talking about. Parents. Teachers. Co workers. Who behave like high school kids who haven't learned to self regulate. \n\n A whole bunch of people are clearly not in this sub to improve themselves or to take constructive criticism. \n\n They're her for their egoes, to be praised as Kings and to throw around insults to feel empowered. The opposite of self improvement. Several have been banned already for just commenting in this thread. \n\nI am honestly glad that girl was blocked,  if this is what OP had to give as soon as she did or said something inconvenient. It sounds very abusive. \n\nTo him that takes nothing, he don't care how he impacts her or me or anyone else , he don't care to make her feel safe and respected, all he cares about is not being rejected or disagreed with. And that's not a reason to date. She deserves someone who respects her. OP has proved he's incapable of that at least based on comments here. \n\nHe commented that other girls have done x for him so he think every single girl he meets should be and do x. \n\nI think everyone with common sense / experience knows what type of people who reasons like that. They are not someone you let your girl friend go and see.",

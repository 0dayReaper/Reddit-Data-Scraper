    "postText": "I'm going to college in the fall and while I'm excited to move on to the next part of my life, I'm not sure if what I chose to major in is what I really want to do for the rest of my life. There have been many things that I want to do in my life but my social anxiety and depression has held me back. This summer I want to complete a checklist of things that I've always wanted to try out but never had the guts to. I want to try acting again, try to be an artist, and perform some stand up comedy at open mics.\n\nI know it's wildy unrealistic to be successful at acting and/or get into the music industry over just one summer, but I should mention that Im not necessarily aiming for success. My hope is that I will find happiness again in the pursuit of those things, and maybe I'll learn about myself in the process.\n\nAnother thing; I'm growing my hair out until the year ends. I feel like to this point in my life, Ive had no control over anything. My mom never let me have longer since she thought long hair looked trashy on men and insisted I keep it short. I'm just excited to see what it will look like. Haven't gotten a haircut since February so I've already made some decent progress \ud83d\udc4d",

You're gonna find out what contempt really is and that it's actually not that bad.\n\nAnd when people like your comedy, you're gonna feel that, too.\n\nIt's gonna be great social calibration. \n\nI don't know if you're looking for advice but if I were you, I'd take the mindset of a scientist.\n\nLike try not to take anything personally. Just do what you do and observe. \n\nDevelop a hypothesis: I expect these these changes to begin in the next 3 months.\n\nThat's just how I do. Keeps me back from the fire a bit when there's high emotional stakes.\n\nAnd one more thing: to keep the stakes even lower, think of everything as practice.\n\nPut in whatever input you think is gonna work. Observe the outcome. Reflect. Repeat.",

Cuse rn it looks more like a 4 Pack  and you'd need to look more closely to see the lower 2 abs, what training techniques should I use? And are protein snacks actually good for working out? Cuse I once heard some of them are fake.",

The lowers take different, harder, much less pleasant exercises, and for most folks, require more commitment to decreasing body fat in order to pop, which for most trainers, means even more stuff they'd rather not be doing.\n\nIt's easy to convince yourself to lie on the ground and crunch a little.  Hanging from a pullup bar, or upside-down on a slant bench...neither goes in the marketing pamphlet for Fun Training World.",

    "postText": "Hi im 16M and my brother is 10M and I need help on how to become a better older brother to him. I am realize for a while now that sometimes I will invalidate how he feels by ignoring him when he is acting out. Sometimes I will even yell at him and he yells too and then its a stupid mess. Thing is I am aware that all im doing is bad and that it will probably affect him negatively. He already doesn't have the best self-esteem and I don't want to worsen that. I dont and not making any excuses for myself because I know what I have been doing is wrong. Its just that I have honestly no clue how to handle things and so here I am. I want to know how to handle conflict better and have better communication with him? How do I stop myself from being mean or invalidating in the middle of a conflict/disagreement?",

Practice being more understanding and kind to yourself and it will flow to others naturally. That's really the only way. \n\nIf you want a resource that will get you real into the weeds, I HIGHLY recommend the book Non-Violent Communication, by Marshal Rosenberg.",

It is like I do not know what to talk about, ask or tell.\n\nAm I just not interested? Are they just too boring/predictable? Am I too boring for them? I'm jealous of all the friends with their siblings who seem to always talk a lot about what ever. How do people do that? I see my siblings maybe 4x per year. Should I have a list of recent events that I go through with them or what? I'm not even super asberger but with my siblings I feel like one.",

My father had a slightly narrow way of showing interest but my mom was normally interested. I think my parents were all in all pretty normal but my whole family is mostly introverts so maybe it is just that.",

            "comment": "You're both young so don't be too hard on yourself. Regulating emotions is a difficult task to learn. Sometimes you just need to let it out. You can try to direct that negative emotion to tearing up junk like paper, or stomp around making a joke of being mad too over something silly.\n\n Stepping away from heated situation is good option and/or asking if you can talk it out later. If you are both yelling no one is listening and you can't properly communicate when the other person is that worked up. Ask questions to them so it makes them feel heard. Remember that once something is said you can't really take it back.   \n\nOne thing that is great thing learn to do to calm down is belly/diaphragmatic breathing. Taking a breather isn't just a saying.",

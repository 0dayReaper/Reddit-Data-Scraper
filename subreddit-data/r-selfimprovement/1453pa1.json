            "comment": "I'm awesome! Lol but it took a lot of work to get awesome ROFL about a year and a half ago I was divorced and I knew it wasn't because of me but such things leave a person wondering \"what did I do wrong?\" And so my journey of self improvement began. Prior to the divorce process I had struggled with anxiety and depression for years severely at that. Those two things also caused me to go through several other life issues. The first thing I began working on was building a set of core values and then researching those values and other people's beliefs about those characteristics so that I could reinforce my belief system and have a strong foundation on my beliefs then practice those beliefs and discuss it openly upon friends and family. I'm not at over a year of researching through reading books testimonies and opinions of others. And have been sharing my own beliefs and putting things into my own words. I think the best way to put it is I'm building my own person religion on what a person should behave like. And have even began building a small following. My goal isn't at all to teach people but more to share who I have became as a person. Anyways I believe I am qualified to offer small bits of advice to people sure to my own journey and I encourage everyone to begin their own journey of self discovery, growth, and work because it really is a lot of  consistent work to become the best possible version of yourself. \nAs a lonely person I can promise the key to communication is through common ground. And you can most likely find common ground with anyone within minutes of meeting. But first the things I recommend focusing on is assuming you're meeting new people then remembering their name. People tend to naturally enjoy the sound of their own name so always remember to same someone's name often when meeting. Also ask about them... People love talking about themselves but don't give to feel into it you don't want to get to personal or try and figure out their life story in the first few minutes lol next in order to find that common ground and get a conversation started you need a good intro. You don't wanna awkwardly go up to someone and say hi I'm whatever what is your name... Instead you wanna try something a little less direct it will be more inviting that way and the person will feel less on the spot. Something I like to do is give people a hard time e about their iPhones lol not because I have anything against them but because it makes for a great ice breaker and lowers conversational tension. That has never failed to lead me into deeper conversation and I'm not at all a talkative person I just know that common ground is how to get someone to keep talking and everyone has phones. Ok I've ranted long enough \ud83d\ude02",

I want to improve desperately though, so I\u2019m trying to forget everything and work on myself physically, socially, and mentally instead of thinking \u201cwhat was so bad about me that he left me for her? What does she have that I don\u2019t? What can i do to make him want to be with me again or love me as much as I did him?\u201d Any advice would be appreciated as well \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

Whether it's because worrying over war in my country or the responsibilities that have been loaded onto me and overthinking. What's helping me the most is therapy! I've been going just over a year now and am proud of my consistency since I tried therapy years before but kept skipping appointments, so at least that's progress. What I am working on right now is understanding myself, emotions and thoughts better, and being kinder to myself whenever the world isn't. Also, I started working on my social skills, which is very exciting, I made new genuine friends and connected with ones I thought I lost a long time ago but I know there are areas of improvement in that aspect lmao. I am slowly healing from a breakup that I been through a year and a half ago, It's kinda frustrating how slow my journey is in that aspect but I keep reminding myself to take as much time as needed. \nI hope that everyone who commented here reach their full potential and their respective goals, be kind to yourselves and to those around you. Sending you all love and blessings.",

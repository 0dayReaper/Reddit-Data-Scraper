I started seeing a pattern in her and I thought I should communicate that she hurt me. I went ahead and started the conversation and she immediately told me I am over-sensitive. I had a moment of self doubt and I actually backed off that day. Later, I moved to another city and from that distance I was able to realize that she is not respectful and aware of my boundaries. I video called her and she started telling me how she is always misunderstood and not valued. I completely lost it but I kept my emotions in control...then I called her out and she told me I am a very selfish person. That was my signal to basically cut all contact for my well being and mental health.",

It is still worth it. But there needs to be a balance so you dont feel taken advantage of or drained and like you have nothing to offer (lived that too, now I\u2019m fixing that)",

Nobody \"deserves\" anything. It's important to recognize and not settle for things that are toxic for you and things that bring you down, but the less expectations you have on what you \"deserve\" the better you will be.  \n\n\nJust my two cents, great list otherwise and good luck on the future!",

And it was initially based on how you treated that employee, not how you responded to me. But now that you pulled that trick out of the hat, it\u2019s very telling about the kind of person you\u2019re and why you lacked taking accountability of your actions in that earlier comment.\n\n I wish the customer care folks a lot of patience and luck for having to deal with the likes of you.\nAnyway. Bye. I dont want to bother with close minded people like you here. Dont bother commenting again.",

It was my old attitude which made me feel sorry for that customer care guy. But after reading this post i felt i did the right thing. Because i don't tolerate inappropriate behaviour. When one is in a position to take care of customers and not doing so then such attitude calls for an action. I pray to God to give me more strength to confront with such inappropriate people. \nAnd about my closed mindedness.. i will leave it to your open mindedness. No comments there because i don't want to spread negativity here.\nI have my right to comment so don't dictate others what to do and what not to do.",

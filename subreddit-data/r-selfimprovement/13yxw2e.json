    "postText": "Im 16 and all throughout my childhood my parents have been and still are strict so when I asked my parents if it was cool for me to hang out with my friends the next day at the mall and they actually agreed to it I\u2019ve been feeling a sort of worry or anxiety because I feel like I\u2019ll be penalized by my parents for having fun or staying out longer than what they would\u2019ve expected. For this scenario the party is from 12:30 to 5 pm. Although I do feel like that\u2019s not bad at all, I am spending practically the day somewhere other than home. I wonder why do I always get this feeling when I do get the chance to hang out with friends outside of school. Can anyone help?",

    "postText": "The stories/narratives we tell ourselves about life, more often than not end up becoming self fulfilling prophecies. \n\nUsually we acquire limiting beliefs through our interactions with other people and the frame we hold in the context of the value we possess, relative to them.\n\nCommon themes include:\n\n\u2022 I\u2019m not good enough.\n\u2022 I\u2019m not smart enough.\n\u2022 I\u2019m not good looking enough.\n\u2022 I\u2019m not competent enough.\n\nOnce we start believing these things, we then naturally start behaving accordingly and then let our \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d gather evidence to support those beliefs.\n\nThe truth is: Whatever you think you can, or can\u2019t do, you\u2019re probably right. What matters more is cultivating beliefs and values that truly align with who you are, or are becoming.\n\nThe question is: How deep are you willing to peer into yourself in order to question your own beliefs for the greater good of self - actualization ?\n\nThe answer\u2026 is something we each have to find for ourselves.",

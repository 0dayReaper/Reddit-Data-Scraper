I wanted the feeling of doing the work I got from reading, but I didn\u2019t actually want to do it. \n\nSo my great secret is this: \n\nTake a book you\u2019re reading and write down 3 guidelines they recommend to address whatever problem you\u2019re trying to solve. \n\nPut those 3 cards by your nightstand and every day until you achieve your goal say to yourself, \u201cI\u2019m going to apply these 3 techniques today if that\u2019s the only thing I do.\u201d \n\nThe notecards make it so you don\u2019t have to remember anything. \n\nThem by your bedstand will be a constant reminder every morning and every night. \n\nThis is how I shifted from a reader, to an applier, to a man who\u2019s actually improving his life. \n\nEnjoy.",

    "postText": "I've never liked sport ever in my life and even if I'm lucky enough to not be obese, I get fatter and fatter every year, so I know it's only a matter of time.\n\nI've tried to run, to swim, to go to the gym, even boxing and yoga and everytime I hated it. I felt miserable and quit. \n\nHowever, a few weeks ago, a friend of mine took me with her to go bouldering. I wasn't interested at all at first, but I was hooked. It's been three weeks and I go with her two days a week. I don't realize that I do exercise until the session is over, it feels like a game and for the first time, I have hope that I did find a sport that I like. Really, it's amazing.\n\nI told my mom and she was ecstatic. I think it's because she was worried about me, even though she never said anything before about my weight or my lack of activity. She even offered to pay me a year's subscription, something like 300$. \n\nSo, here's the problem : I really can't afford every session. I know some people that work there (well, my friend did and she introduced us) and sometimes they let me go without paying because they know I'm struggling. My mom isn't rich, this kind of money represents an investment for her and I'm afraid of letting her down. What if I quit ? I don't want to, right now, but given my history, there's a strong possibility I do. I don't want her to waste her money. But at the same time, I know that if she doesn't, I would have to rely on the kindness of the people working there, and I don't want to either. \n\nWhat do you think should I do ?",

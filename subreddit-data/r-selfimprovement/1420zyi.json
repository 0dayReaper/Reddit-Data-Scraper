Small steps each day. Rooting for you!!",

I go through phases of giving up and feeling motivated, what helps me personally is anger, I\u2019m not satisfied with the situation im in, crushes my soul, makes me feel miserable and in pain, me hating the state my world has turned to is the reason I wake up, It\u2019s the reason although I\u2019m emotionally always in pain, I go beyond what I have to in order to get closer to escaping this.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to get out of line. \nLong story short, anger and dissatisfaction of the situation I\u2019m currently in.",

I think I'm a great person. I do not need to be in a relationship to be happy. But I do need to believe that someone out there thinks I'm worth the time and effort an relationship takes to be happy, but I have yet to find anyone that appreciates me. No matter what I do, I'm never good enough for anyone. Instead, I just end up used and discarded like trash. I don't understand why I keep being treated like this and I don't know what else to do. I have never posted in this sub and I was hoping some of you could offer me some advice that I haven't already heard or show me a different perspective. I have already done all of the things that that people normally tell you to do and I've taken all of the advice that has been given to me over the years and none of it has worked. I cannot live the rest of my life with the knowledge that I'll never be desirable and I don't know how much longer I can go on.\n\nEdit: I guess I should probably mention that I'm not a man.",

And as someone who is autistic and has been severely traumatized, i'm aware that I'm not everyone's cup of tea. \n\nWhen I have feelings of self-doubt and I feel unlovable -- and being honest, that happens more than I'd like to admit -- I try to remember that I was once married and we were married for 8 years. And she very clearly loved me for me (because God knows I didn't have anything else to offer lol). \n\nAs I mentioned above regarding trauma, i've made efforts to do more. I've made efforts to get involved and do the things I enjoy doing. I was married for eight years and experienced some incredible trauma that contributed to our divorce and continued on well through our divorce. When I was married and contemplated life and our plans, it was through the lens of \"our\" life as a couple. As a result of everything, it took me awhile to rediscover myself. \n\nSo, I mentioned I'm autistic so I don't know if everyone does it this way, but I have a tendency to approach life in a very specific way. I had to really think about what I wanted. Like, really, really think super hard and take into consideration who I am and what my skills and limitations really are. And then once I saw what I wanted my life to look like, I made efforts to get there, slowly but surely. I started volunteering more and allowed myself the freedom to have fun. I have been trying to build the life I want and for me, not for anyone else. It will always be a work in progress because that's how life really is and if people want to come along for the ride, great. If not, well, I have achieved the incredible feat of being ridiculously self sufficient on my journey.  \n\nAuthenticity is key. If you're not authentic, then you will be seen as someone who is disingenuous. \n\nI'm the kind of person where if when I meet you and I like you, I *really* like you, not like in a romantic or sexual way, but in a, I think you're so incredibly awesome that I cannot imagine my life without you in it way. \n\nI value that I'm self-aware, but I'm not stuck. Meaning, I can recognize how I appear to others and try to assess what I can or cannot change. Like, I can't change the fact I was traumatized or that I'm autistic, and despite the best intentions of everyone, it definitely doesn't endear me to others. The world can be incredibly superficial. In person, I'm much more affable and enjoyable to be around than I am online. A tactic abusers use to perpetuate abuse is to socially isolate their victims. How do they do this? Well, they know that most people don't have the patience or inclination to be around others who are suffering, wallowing, or experience any kind of pain. So, what my abusers have done is inflict their crazy-making behavior and time it to when I'm with others as a way to influence them (and me) to make me even less tolerable to others because few people want to deal with someone who appears to be in throws of distress psychological or physical. Extrapolating from that dynamic, I found that the best way to counter that attack is instead of talking about my specific pain, reframe and contextualize the situation as being emblematic of a larger situation. So I started a nonprofit. \n\nI've read some of your posts and comment history. There is a bit of validity in the idea of faking it until you make it.  How is anyone going to know who you are and be able to like you for you if the only side of yourself that you've shown is how your trauma has made you feel? And I get it too, I'm not always puppies, sunshine, and rainbows and despite the progress I've made, I definitely wallow from time to time. Part of my therapeutic process involves working on better recognizing those inclinations and reducing the amount of time it takes to notice it. \n\nMaybe we can be friends and if so, i'll like you for you. What kind of music do you like?",

Of the posts you made, the majority of them were negative (I feel like an IRL Clippy judging the tone of your posts, lol, I'm sorry). But I digress, every moment is an opportunity to go in a different direction. \n\nI didn't look through your comments, just your posts. And I don't even judge because like I said, I don't not feel some of the feelings you expressed. If you want to commiserate over the cruelty of others, well, I'll do that with you too. \n\nBut guess what? You attracted me. So, that's something (sorry you didn't attract something better lol). \n\nI said I would be your friend! Without any expectations. Just be yourself and as long as you're not a hateful person, you support equality (as in LGBTQ+ equality and intersectional Feminism), and you're not actively committing crimes, then i can't imagine why we cannot be friends and I wouldn't like you for you. Like seriously. Do you have esoteric hobbies? I can't wait to hear all about them. I've watched the entirety of sex and the city with an ex girlfriend; when it comes to finding common ground, you will struggle to find someone more genuinely accommodating. \n\nA little bit about me (I feel like I'm writing a description of myself as if this is like a doggy adoption):\n\nWell socialized and cultured. I managed to go to an embassy event last night in DC and didn't embarrass myself or the United States. I had several social interactions with people from other countries and I genuinely made them laugh. \n\nI do volunteer work in the town where I live. \n\nI created and manage multiple Instagram pages dedicated to the canine populations of the town I live in and the neighboring town because it makes me (and others) happy. \n\nI have a tendency to listen to songs on repeat; one reason why I do it is because I try to analyze what about the song I like that resonates with me (I'm a music theory nerd). \n\nI really like going to thrift stores, garage sales, estate sales, and flea markets. I love the concept of upcycling and discussing strategies that focuses on reducing manufacturing new widgets and leveraging technology that brings us closer to post-scarcity (I already think we're there). \n\nI'm a musician that plays multiple instruments and I have no shame. That means if I see an instrument that's not brass or woodwind, I have to play it lol \n\nI will express interest in doing things without necessarily ever really putting much or any effort in making that a reality.  That's my fault because often, it's a poor choice of words on my part and because I have a decent vocabulary, I should know better (I've been getting better though). I enjoy the process of business development and discussing ideas even if I will never fully develop them. It's a hobby of mine. It's fun for me. \n\nI've had multiple people blame me for things that occurred during literal REM sleep (mine and theirs) and as a result, they harmed me IRL.",

This sounds an awful lot like you assuming that the only side of myself that I show to people is trauma and I responded wondering why you made that assumption. If that wasn't got intention with this statement, then I apologize for my misinterpretation.\n\nMy posts are negative because I was either venting my frustrations or asking for advice. Obviously they are going to be negative when that's specifically what I'm posting about. I don't have anyone in real life that I can talk to so if I'm feeling bad, where else can I turn to try to get some perspective or advice? I don't understand this attitude that I've seen on Reddit where people act as if your posts are a reflection of every aspect of your life instead of just a part of it. There are certain issues that I need help with and those are what I make posts about. Does everyone on Reddit post about every single aspect of themselves and what they are thinking and doing at all times so they assume others do the same? I make posts with a purpose.\n\nI don't know if you are just visiting DC or if you live in the area, but I don't live far from there. I was just there this weekend and will be there again on Friday as well. I go there a lot because it's the closest place I can find things to do.",

    "postText": "I have a problem with taking things too personally. I can\u2019t just be upset and deal with it, I feel the need to bring people down to the way I\u2019m feeling. I realize that it\u2019s bad and I wish I didn\u2019t do it, but I genuinely have no idea how to even work on something like that. An example was a friend of mine said something to me that was rude and they apologized for it right away. But my brain just can\u2019t accept the apology for what it\u2019s worth and I wish I could. I just try to do anything that would make them upset because that\u2019s how I\u2019m feeling. It\u2019s such a childish mindset and I really want some opinions on how to work on it.",

That mind for me is helpful to make the changes I want to manifest.\n\nYou may need to cultivate the skills first. \n\nLike a new plumber that wants to redo an entire house\u2019s plumbing. First question is\u2026 do you even know how?",

Try giving yourself more time to choose the response you want instead.\n\nHow would you like to respond? In the example you gave, I assume you would prefer to just accept the apology and move on. But it really doesn't feel that easy. \n\nYou can try voicing how you feel without bringing the other person down with you. \"Hey, I appreciate your apology, but what you said really made me feel \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and I'm having trouble letting go of that feeling right now. I don't want to ruin our hangout, so I'm gonna take some time to myself.\" It may seem like you're being dramatic, but trust and believe THAT response is loads better than your automatic reaction of bringing the other person down with you. Also, letting that feeling be known will likely fulfill the need that you feel to make sure the other person knows how much their words/actions affected you.\n\nI will always advocate for being open, authentic, and communicative, but if you're uncomfortable voicing your feelings like that just yet, then just take some deep breaths (make sure your exhale is longer than your inhale) and think about what kind of person you want to be in this moment. You don't want to be the person that holds onto negative feelings and brings other people down. You want to be the person who can be sympathetic of other people's mistakes, forgive them, and let it go. You have to choose which person you're going to be in every moment that calls for a decision.",

    "postText": "For starters, if this is the wrong subreddit, I'm sorry.\n\nI'm a 20 year old female. I still live with my mom and dog. I recently got diagnosed with various mental health things (see further down).\n\nI've always felt like I'm destined to do something great like so many people out there (like idk, become a singer, actress, yk). \n\nThe problem is, I'm fat (120kg), lazy, don't have any talents or things I can work with (I can't sing, act, pose, play an instrument, paint,...), have bad habits I can't get out of (overeating, nail biting, doom scrolling,..) and so many irrational fears (emetophobia, driving cars, being in a car when somebody else drives, heights, needles,...), and worst of all, there's nothing that really sparks an interested in me. I literally have no idea of who I am and of who I really want to be.\n\nI also have ADD, dyscalculia, depression and generalized anxiety disorder and let me tell you, it doesn't make things easier. I got diagnosed with all three this year. I also got a lot of trauma from being diagnosed so late, shitty parenting (I learned no hygiene, not how to run a household, gaslighting, silent treatment, constantly talking about my weight and insulting me,...) and bullying in school. \n\nI also don't have friends, not even one, so I have literally nobody in my life to talk to.\n\nI'm not dumb and I know that, it's just that I have no real interested in anything in life, and I never had. I never had hobbies (I tried lots of sports but I come from an overweight, unathletic family which took me out as soon as I complained once and tbh, I don't even know if there's one I really liked), I don't play an instrument, nothing.\nAt the same time, I have so many interests (no talents I can work with and nothing I want to pursue further if it gets hard though) that it gets overwhelming and I wanna be so many different people at once. I want to be a psychologist, a singer, a model, a photographer, a teacher, anything, you name it. I made lists with pro and cons, lists with jobs I am able to pursue with all my mental health problems and diagnoses but when there's one thing I am able to pursue and I start it, I don't stay on it for long because it gets super boring and then I just drop it.\n\nI kinda want to move out and take the dog with me (my mom doesn't really care about him but when I tell her I'll take him with me as soon as I move out she suddenly does care), but I always got told that I wouldn't even make it a month by my mom. I never worked a day in my life and now it's super hard to get a job. \n\nI feel so hopeless about my life and I don't know where to start to get out of this. \nI know I probably should be in therapy but I can't afford it and also my anxiety makes it super hard to talk to people in real, so I'm writing this down in hopes anybody can help me.\n\nEdit: I added a few details on how everything affects me so you guys can understand my problems a bit better :)\n\nEdit 2: I tend to doomscroll on TikTok a lot and the worst thing is - I really like it. I know I shouldn't but it gives me so much dopamine. Another things is I'm super scared of judgement, especially from my mum, and it's holding me back so much. Someone suggested to take a walk in the morning. If I do that, my mom would judge me so badly saying \"Ohh she wants to be healthy finally but it won't work haha\" (while sitting on her couch and munching on her 5th pack of potato chips) and all that stuff which makes me completely stop taking walks because it hurts so much when she says things like that. I know I really need to work on being more independent from her and her opinions, but on the other hand I feel like the only solution for this problem is to move out which feels like such an unreachable goal. It's truly a vicious circle..",

I guess my greatest issue with routines is that they tend to bore me extremely because it's always the same and after a few days I'm just to lazy to do them and then I completely stop. I tend to do better with routines that are interesting me (for example I have a Duolingo streak of 1245 because I like the language I'm learning haha) but daily routines are pretty hard",

Learn about the growth mindset even by googling it. Also what color is my parachute. Right now I think you have a fixed mindset on what you can do and what you can't. And it's silencing your interests. You want to do everything and nothing. You may be afraid of failure and concentrating on your diagnoses. \n\nADD people have creative and ability in crisis situations, some are good entrepreneurs. \n\nWrite down all of your interests. You can circle three to work on this month. Work on one of them a day as the mood takes you. What's important is just trying. You'll get better as you do it. \n\nAnything you choose to do will require a bit of learning and work, accepting that you might fail is a journey. \n\nI use the fabulous app and habitica to get better habits. You can stay on the free trial of the fabulous app if you cancel within 7 days otherwise it costs money. Habitica is a gamification app.  \n\nI think a little bit of yoga or meditation can help you start to get a better mindset. Yoga with adriene is an option",

How does your morning routine look?\n\n I noticed a sharp decline in scrolling and an increase in motivation by starting my day with a short walk outside in the sun. Doesn't have to be long, I started with a walk around the block now I cover a good 3-5km, sometimes more. Sunlight + exercise after waking will help wake you up and set cirdlcadian rhythm boosting sleep that night, sunlight boosts your mood and increases efficacy of dopamine receptors, driving up motivation for the day. Plus, even if you end up lazing/doomscrolling all day, at least you got out for that walk! If you can, walking through nature is great for the mind as well \ud83d\ude0a",

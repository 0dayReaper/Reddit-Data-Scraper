For the longest time I thought it was impossible for me to gain weight or muscle.\n\nBut, with better planning and determination, I\u2019ve reached my goal. \n\nI think this is the first goal I\u2019ve set that takes a plan and consistent effort, that I actually achieved.\n\nI set a low bar so I wouldn\u2019t stress myself out, and I achieved it faster than I thought - so another 10lbs is on the horizon. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is: Baby steps! You got this!",

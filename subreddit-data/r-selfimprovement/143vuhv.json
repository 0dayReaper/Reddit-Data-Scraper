    "postText": "Hello all! :)\n\nI have a question. I understand (or at least I think I do) the concept of living and choosing for yourself rather than living for others. However, a lot of what I want in myself involves being marketable to women, providing value to friends, being available for loved ones and family and being of service to others like friends or strangers.\n\nI go to the gym to be healthy and strong. Part of that is so I can go up the stairs without being winded or be able to lift stuff and provide for myself around the house. But if I\u2019m being honest with myself, I large part of the reason I go to the gym is so I can feel better overall so that I can be what I want (listed above) for others.\n\nAm I thinking about this \u201clive for yourself thing\u201d all wrong?\n\nThank you all, much appreciated.",

Becoming a families campfire. Growing in size until the kids grow up and head out to make their own. With the knowledge you give them on how to maintain one, and the dangers of how one can lose themselves without one to keep them warm.",

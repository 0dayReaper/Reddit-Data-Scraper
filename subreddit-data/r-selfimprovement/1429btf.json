If it\u2019s that belief then the antidote is actually humility and accepting that we didn\u2019t and don\u2019t know better then we did.",

If it was decadent and enjoyable, just focus on how nice it was to treat yourself and how awesome it is to be able to enjoy something like that. Let it be special and go back to business as usual tomorrow. One day isn't going to wreck your health or fitness, I can tell you that from experience, so you don't deserve the beating you're giving yourself.",

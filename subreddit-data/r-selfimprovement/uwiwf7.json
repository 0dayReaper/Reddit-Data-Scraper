    "postText": "**EDIT:**\n\n*Thank you everyone for the love and support. I could not reply to everyone but I have read every single comment and appreciate your responses. I am also glad my post helped some too. Thank you for those who sent awards and best wishes. &lt;3*\n\nI am not sure if this post fits this subreddit but I want to share what I am going through in a hope it may help someone else.\n\n12 hours ago, I was in the worst accident of my life. I thought I am dead but I survived without any major injuries.\n\nI was riding my motorbike bike and was going back to home. I use the same route everyday. Yesterday, there was a traffic jam and I estimated it would take 5-10 minutes. Instead of waiting, I can take another route which is a 4-lane road.\n\nI was riding as usual and was on lane 2 from left and suddenly a car from my left tried to overtake and slightly pushed/hit me from my left side. I tried to control it. First it went right, then left, and then right in to the 4th lane with heavy traffic.\n\nThere was a Ford 150 like car on the 4th lane that slammed the brake. In those moments, time felt slow, I can feel my body and bike falling meanwhile hearing the screeching sound of brakes of everyone behind me.\n\nFortunately, there was no big vehicle behind me and that driver slammed the brake in the right time. I got control of my bike and saved myself from crashing into the barrier on the right side. But it hit my left leg badly.\n\nIts been 12 hours since then I am still in shock. My brain and mind feels empty, those worries, anxieties, and thoughts are missing and in a way I am liking it. It feels so empty and peaceful and in the meantime life feels so meaningless. I could have died yesterday and all the struggles, my savings, my wife, my family, friends and everything I have would have disappeared in 5 minutes.\n\nI overthink a lot about everything, have anxiety about future, inflation and money, I sacrifice my needs and happiness for others, don't want to hurt others but get hurt.\n\nThe accident has made me realize that life is temporary and very uncertain. I could just die without any fault of my own and all my worries and people I care about won't be able to bring me back. Eventually they will move on.\n\nSo, why I should I waste my life for others?\n\nFrom today and onwards, I am going to appreciate the limited life I have, I will prioritize my needs, my happiness and just myself. Everyone and everything comes after. And instead of thinking about future a lot and saving money, I will spend a good chunk on it on my well being.\n\nI will take care of myself. I will live as I am going to tomorrow and make everything count.\n\nThank you if you have read so far.",

All my friends are hearing, and I haven\u2019t been deaf enough to belong to \u201cDeaf Culture\u201d. \n\nSomething you said resonates with me; I just cant do the things any more that defined my personality. It completely throws your sense of self, having to reinvent your goals, hobbies and outlets\u2026 because we are what we repeatedly do (Aristotle) but if our ability to do things is taken away, does it change who we are able to be? I think not. I am my mind, and my tools to demonstrate and exercise it have changed. Sharing these thoughts are often met by the over-positivity-climb-the-mountain-see-the-view brigade, but I had to try and make peace with things that are simply shut off to me now. \n\nI\u2019m trying to think about the things I enjoy, accept the things I cant do, and find new environments or ways to exercise my personality. I\u2019m trying to initiate and host things, instead of going to things where I feel like I cant join in / I\u2019m a dead weight. \n\nDunno why I\u2019m sharing this. But I wish you luck in finding your aspirations. \n\nOn a random side note\u2026 I\u2019m an artist (circus - silent and visual, go figure\u2026). I dont know what your interests were before your accident, so this may be way off-target. But I know a lot of circus performers and athletes who are missing limbs. Not telling you to \u201cclimb the mountain\u201d but, if you were physically very active before, dont shy away from trying stuff like handstand classes or even aerial skills. If you want physical goals etc. Check out Extraordinary Bodies (Cirque Bijou).",

Idk how to explain it, but the handicap lens that everyone sees me through is just not very good. I understand their point of view, I mean I would be like that probably before my accident. But it's the hand holding, the treating like a kid, or moreover the not treating like a full adult that is just weird. \n\nJune 25 is my one year of my accident. So far I've sort of coped via diving into work, video games, but I do feel like my mental health is deteriorating a bit. Especially because I was a planning kind of guy. And now, I can't think one week ahead, can't plan. \n\nI'm shifting cities (2000km) tomorrow. I'm planning a solo cab ride, my first, in a couple of hours to my favorite spot in the city. \n\nSorry, just rambling now. I'll probably try things to initiate and help people understand me better, cause I know that's on me. But even I'm trying to understand what I can do better. \n\nI'm also above knee amputee, so it's a bit tougher. Loss of anything is just so so so weird. Cause all those minute things that I took for granted before, I ealaize how easy life was and how important every literal part of my body is.",

Like, I\u2019m just deaf\u2026 I dont have any neurological or processing issues\u2026 but I am somehow treated as an after thought, or like I\u2019m too-slow, or people are so overly-nice it can feel disingenuous or make me feel even more like a liability. Really, I\u2019m a really independent guy - but its like no one else can see me like that any more. And I both appreciate and resent the help. \n\nAnd generally speaking, no one has time for negativity, so it can feel pretty savage when all you\u2019re doing is being human and grieving or dealing with very real frustrations.\n\nI\u2019ve also used video games a fair bit - which always gets some weird \u201ctaboo\u201d vibes from the over-positive types. But they dont live my life, so they don\u2019t appreciate the social interaction, mental stimulus, hand eye coordination, jumping between worlds of art, and sense of overcoming challenge in the same way that I do. I cant just walk into busy situations and get that stimulus the way they can. Socialising is active hard work for me. \n\nI think not trying to satisfy and make excuses to live up to other peoples expectations is a key thing in the pursuit of happiness. But as you say, it can also open you up to isolation/depression/not going outside your comfort zone for new connections/experiences. \n\nI think initiating things and being an advocate for your own needs is the most useful and practical \u2018realisation\u2019 to arrive at. For me it was, anyway. Still a mission a lot of the time of course!\n\nAnyway; also rambling. Enjoy the cab ride to your nostalgic city spot. Maybe switching things up and going to a new city will be a good thing. I feel like sometimes, when we dont have answers, we just gotta change lots of stuff until some kind of sense emerges.",

Not just to walk but to think clearly, and to take care of my basic needs. I was a happy and active 33 year old before that with my whole life in front of me. I now have caregivers and my partner take care of me. Wow it was all so hard, words can\u2019t really describe. The first month of being bedbound I was so intensely depressed and suicidal. I found this documentary on YouTube called Claire about a young woman with cystic fibrosis and her incredible attitude towards sickness and disability and it changed my whole perspective. Highly recommend it. It saved my life. Also listening to Eckhart Tolle\u2019s book on audible everyday \u201cThe Power of Now\u201d has radically changed me and helped me reframe this whole shitty experience. He has a lot of videos on YouTube as well that are great. This post was actually featured in the Eckhart Tolle Reddit page and it\u2019s how I ended up here. \n\nI can really relate to having to let go of all your previous goals. That\u2019s been one of the hardest parts for me. I\u2019ve come to accept it now (tho I still need to process through waves of grief that come and go), and now I just want to leave a simple, peaceful life and I\u2019m mostly ok with that (I was a world traveler before for many years so I still miss that). In Buddhism folks that experience radical life shifts through sickness or disability are often viewed as karmically lucky in a way because the amount of suffering we must face gives up ample opportunity to awaken. Trying to seize that opportunity in this lifetime and make the best of things.",

Not only that a lot of that help could've been directed towards me, and I truly needed it, but it could have also prevented the accident.\n\nIt was a big blow to my health, both mentally and physically. I reached the same conclusion. You should do things for yourself first of all, then only once you are in a position to help others consider doing it, but never go overboard, otherwise people will take advantage of you.\n\nLife is short. I understand that not everyone is fortunate, but giving them too much is also bad, and you can't really help everyone.",

At 21 years old, when I was a newlywed, my doctors placed me BACK on *another year* of chemotherapy. So, nine years total by the time I was 22. \n\nThere's more stuff too. Last week, I had ***major*** reconstructive craniofacial &amp; jaw surgery for an ultra-rare medical development (reported less than 200 times worldwide), and surgery carried massive risk. In a nutshell, they detached my skull from my jaw, and completely rebuilt/replaced my entire jaw and face with custom prosthetic hardware. There's also a fuckton of hardware on my skull now too. \n\nI'm now in my mid-to-late 20's. I shouldn't be alive today. Yet, somehow I'm still alive and kicking. I've traveled to 20+ countries, went to college, have a kick-ass budding career in STEM making six figures/year, got married, bought a house, etc. Overall, life is generally pretty fucking awesome. My husband and I live a really fun, fulfilled life full of travel, professional and personal development opportunities, etc. \n\nWe humans are far more resilient than we give ourselves credit for. I'm glad you're here with us!",

However, considering this is kind of a traumatic situation, I highly recommend you see a therapist who specializes in trauma to help you prevent getting PTSD. As a person who's had it, that diagnosis will cause chaos when you least expect it and it's harder to get rid of than to prevent. Some people who see someone as soon as the incident happens can prevent ever getting it.",

If I had reacted any slower, I would not be here. \n\nThe rest of the drive home I thought a lot about how little it takes to put an unnessesary end to all this. I thought about all the potential days ahead of me that I would have never had. I thought about how seemingly tiny decisions can bend and twist the course of your life. Think of all the times you didn't engage a woman (if you're a man) you thought was beautiful. It's crazy to think how many potential futures are waiting out there. Every second people around the world make endless decisions, moving through the occean of possible directions. The present is a strange thing considering how very different it could have been. \n\nThat day I understood the value of opportunities a little more, so don't waste any more of them than necessary, be bold in your pursuit of a better life.\n\nI thank you for reminding me of all this. It's a lesson I want to keep at hand.",

            "comment": "Thanks for sharing this. An old school friend of mine died suddenly of a heart attack a couple of weeks ago. I haven\u2019t seen him much since school but have occasionally bumped into him around the way and we\u2019ve always got along well. He was also mid thirties, fit and seemingly healthy, so it\u2019s come as a great shock. Although we weren\u2019t that close I\u2019ve still found it very upsetting. I think I\u2019m having a similar experience to you in response to his death. It\u2019s got me thinking a lot about the fragility of life and really making me think hard about what\u2019s important and what I should be devoting my time &amp; energy to. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s an unusual reaction, maybe because he\u2019s the first person of the same age as myself in my immediate circle that has passed away. It\u2019s really made me evaluate and realise what\u2019s important in my own life.",

            "comment": "I'm sorry you had a scary accident like that, but happy you survived it! I can relate to everything you said. On December 23, 2019 I was driving home from hiking at a state park, with my dog in the backseat. I was on a country road with a bad turn. The speed limit was 45 mph but the turn was 20 mph. As I was approaching the turn, I saw headlights coming from the opposite direction. The car was going too fast around the corner, over corrected and came head-on into my lane. It happened so fast but felt like it was in slow motion. I had no place to swerve so I slammed my brakes. The last thing I remember before impact is screaming and thinking we're dead. I woke up a minute or 2 later, confused by the cloud of white powder in the air and realized every airbag had deployed. Then I remembered my dog was with me and started freaking out calling her name, thinking she had been ejected. Miraculously, she tore through the dog hammock in my backseat and hit the back of the passenger seat. I was in shock and pain but was able to get out of the car, grab my dog and limp off the road into a field. My body was severely bruised for over a month from the seat belt and my legs were bruised from impacting the dashboard, but we were both okay. My car's entire front end was pancaked up to the dashboard, and totaled. That accident traumatized me for a few months. I realized just how quickly life can change in an instant. Another person's mistake can cause you to lose your life, no matter how safe you drive or try to protect yourself from harm or risks. I decided to live my life more fully from that moment on. When the pandemic hit and people were terrified, I never once felt afraid. I truly believe when it's your time to go, it's your time. That wasn't my time.",

I was one of the early ones who caught Covid19,. and I ended up spending 38 days in Hospital (16 of those days in ICU on a Ventilator). I did a full write up of the experience.. but apparently I cannot link to it here because linking is forbidden :( .. DM me if you want the link. \n\nBut yeah.. that whole experience really gave me a new perspective on life.\n\nIt's really frustrating to me now how shallow and superficial people get about small things (complaining about technology or how their favorite restaurant is closed for a day or whatever).\n\nI also find myself having a lot less patience now for people doing asinine or stupid things. (I try not to be a dick about it.. but some days the stress really does get to me)\n\nIt's given me a much more deeper appreciation of life.. but it's also really clarified for me how frivolous most people's behavior and attitudes are. Like,. I'll be driving and someone will cut me off and inevitably I see them 2 blocks ahead pulling into a drive-through coffee place,. and I'm like.. \"Really ?... your potential life or death rush was for THAT ?.. \"\n\nIt's infuriating",

            "comment": "I've lost a friend, one month ago. I can't stop thinking about it. In the last two years I've lost quite some people. Cancer, pandemic, accidents. But this was even worst.\n\nWe went to the same university. We lived in the same students residence for years. Under the same roof, eating together, studying together, and so on. Years. Then life divided our paths. Then, all of a sudden, few months ago he told me that he started working in my hometown. He loved it, and he wanted to get back in touch with me.  As soon as I came back, we met again. It looked like 17 years just didn't pass. He had a new girlfriend. She was amazing, and there was \"some long term project\" about her. His way of choosing words always made me laugh. He never had problems with girls, you know. He was the guy that managed to achieve top results at the University (medicine... an easy choice, huh?) and also have time for sports, gym, friends, and for a little rock band. He could play guitar and bass. And time for girls, lol. He always said he wanted one woman for life, and he was faithful with every girlfriend he had. He was so serious every time a little illness disturbed his health, because \"if I pass that to her, I'm responsible for every happy minute she'll lose, and to me that's a serious thing\". But let's say that the search for the woman of his life wasn't such a terrible thing, if you know what I mean. And at the same time a sincere guy, helping every time he could. When I left, he told me \"let's not wait 15 more years!\". I laughed \"I won't!\".\n\nI always thought I would meet him one day, with a couple kids and a loving wife. Always making everyone feel good with him. Always mocking or joking with everyone and finding a way to make you laugh, or at least just relax.\n\n\nOne month ago I read the online edition of my hometown's newspaper. And you can imagine how I felt when I read that he died. I checked many times, I called friends, I was so desperate I also wrote him a message \"please tell me it's not true\". It was. I cried so much. I punched the wall, and imagined asking him \"why did you go away now, now you found that one girl, now, you idiot\". I asked God himself why him, why not me. Now I see his face, the expression he had every time he was sad and felt impotent. When the only words you could hear from him were \"well, that's life, isn't it?\" with such a sad voice and a shrug, going back to his room. I see that face every time I feel my life is a trainwreck. Every time I should do something different, every time I'm sad. \n\n\nSometimes I wish I never met him. God. But if he could, he would tell me to live. LIVE and take every single drop of life I can squeeze out of a day. He used to say \"we only live once, but if you do it well it's enough\".\n\n\nI don't know you, I guess I never will. But I am happy for you, cause you found by yourself a truth many of us never understand, until it's too late. Live and be happy, and be good with everyone, every single day of your new life.\n\nA big hug.",

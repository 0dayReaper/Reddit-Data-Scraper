    "postText": "1. Your core friendship group will evolve over the coming years. Prioritise similarity of values over perceived social standing when it comes to selecting newcomers.\n2. Don\u2019t feel insecure about peers who get off to a fast start, careerwise. We each work at our own pace, and you have plenty of time to figure out your true calling.\n3. If you want people to perceive you as mature; use your manners, treat others with respect and show plenty of humility.\n4. If you start saving and investing now, you\u2019ll thank yourself later. At the same time, go easy on yourself if you don't manage to save much at all. There's plenty of time to play catch-up in your mid to late twenties and thirties.\n5. Find yourself a great mentor. Someone who holds themselves accountable for your progress, but takes no credit for your success.\n6. If you're having no luck with the ladies (or men, if you\u2019re that way inclined), maybe it's just not your time yet. Overall, for men, dating becomes a lot easier in our later twenties/thirties.\n7. If you want to find your passion, get busy trying your hand at anything. Inspiration for passion often comes to those who are already busy working at something else.\n8. Don\u2019t be in a rush to be taken seriously as an adult. By the time you are, you'll miss how much freedom from responsibility you had in your early twenties.\n\nPlease share any additional advice that comes to mind!",

Doing the work is hard and it\u2019s sucks and feels shitty to be vulnerable in front of a stranger. It feels bad when you don\u2019t have a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d like you see on TV, and sometimes it feels like garbage to pay someone to talk to you. Depression turns every good thing you do for yourself on it\u2019s head and pulls you deeper into the muck. \n\nAll I can say is there is another side to it. I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it, it is fucking hard. It\u2019s amazing and worth it. I did the work, I\u2019m stronger, and if you make a call to set up an appointment with a mental health professional, I know that you will get stronger too once you do the work. \n\nGood luck my friend, you\u2019re not alone.",

I know there's a lot of stigma surrounding mental illness but your mental health is just as important as your physical health. Depression is treatable if not curable. Depression can stem from a lot of things. Most often it follows an onset of insecurities that are born of our negative experiences in life. If talking to a liscenced therapist one on one is scary for you try reaching out to a close friend or family member. Talking about traumas and insecurities can be extremely uncomfortable so prepare yourself mentally and find a good listener. Think of it like a bandaid the terror is worse than the pain. When you start to open up you will hear yourself say things that may not be as serious or truthful. Question the things you tell yourself. Ask if there is a legitimate reason for those internalized statements. Ask yourself if those reasons are within your control. If they are, change it. If not, realize that you're not perfect, no one is and that is okay. You can still figure out how to change yourself to deal with the things you can't change. Asking for help is okay too.",

It should have affected men and women equally but men suffer more for reasons that are still unknown to me.\n\nLong version: The dismantling of religion, god and gender roles seem to be the main reason for the male identity crisis. Previously a man's purpose was to go to school, get a degree/learn a trade, marry a woman and have kids, protect and provide for them, perhaps get drafted in a war and die since most of our past is filled with conflict. While there was a lack of freedom, everything was clearly defined so you wouldn't be spending time wondering about your purpose.\n\nWe also live in strange times where women are free to be feminine as well as masculine but society still pushes men to be masculine. If a man sees women and children in danger (caught in a fire, getting violently or sexually assaulted, etcetera), then he must attempt to save them even if it puts his life in danger otherwise he is a coward. For the first time in history, more women are in college than men, men are dropping out of high school and college due to a lack of purpose but women still expect men to earn more than them (Sources were removed for containing links). The constant male bashing in some mainstream places - such as the two schools which forced boys to stand up and apologize for being male - also contribute to this identity crisis. No such gender roles are imposed on women.\n\nTheoretically the dismantling of gender roles should have caused equal amounts of confusion between men and women, but I see mostly men suffering from this. Philosophical places online are extremely male dominated. If a person asks a question concerning his purpose, it will be from a man the vast majority of the time. I've also noticed that women tend to ask what their purpose is as a human being, while men tend to ask what their purpose is as a man. There are many articles and videos on the internet on what it means to be a man while there are almost none on what it means to be a woman. And so it seems like more men are facing identity crisis' compared to women.\n\nThe men that you are talking about seem to have well defined goals and purposes who unfortunately happen to be sexist since they make matters more difficult for you. But the men that I'm speaking about are mostly in their late teens and 20s who spend most of their time online and have no goals and purposes.",

I vaguely remember hearing about this.  \n\nReminds me of a similar time in 1996 where I was taking an English class (102 - Arguments) where the professor was a newly out and proud lesbian and freshly divorced (go her!) and I was in the class with 1 other male and ~30 other women.\n\nThe first topic was to write on was rape.  I NTF (nope'd the f$@k) outta there because regardless of what I wrote, I wasn't going to get what I perceived as a fair shake.  I also know that some of the things I wanted to write, I'd be embarrassed I penned it, today.  The world has changed for the better _in a lot of ways_.  I've learned a thing or two since then.

Men and their problems are glaring and extremely obvious and tragic they don't need pointing out. Going on and on about it to women will never go anywhere. They are hardwired to be self-concerned and look out for themselves, for obvious evolutionary and biological reasons as child bearers.\n\nI have seen plenty of times where a man voices concerns and problems and women just feign concern. They find it unattractive and awkward. Men need to regrow their brotherhoods and courage to come together and lift one another up again. We are on our own if we don't have our brothers.",

This is the most important time of your life, every uncomfortable situation you avoid is a chance for you to experience a new thing and you will regret such little things later in life.\n\n2. get involved in everything that's happening around you, never back out just because you think you suck at it. You'll be surprised how good you are at things that you don't like\n\n3. Focus on fitness, both of the mind and body, You won't believe how much trouble and money you'll be saving for yourself down the road.\n\n4. This will be the decade of a lot of hard confrontations for you, with the ones you love and with yourself too. Never let things ruin you mental peace.\n\n5. Listen to your Dad, now is the time when you'll be learning a lot of imp life lessons from your father and you might also discover that they're not as great as you once thought but you'll have to accept that they're only human.\n\n6. You'll be developing the world view which will stay with you for the rest of your life. There will be a lot of things that will piss you off, you'll find it hard to remain calm but it's okay, it's a phase and it'll pass. Practice meditation, make it your habit.\n\n7. You'll encounter a lot of  distractions too. There will be people who will promise the world just to get the better of you, So watch out, you'll be betrayed a lot. So better accept that you're on your own.\n\n8. This is the time to figure out your priorities and stick to them, that doesn't mean you shouldn't try new things but just know that it's equally easier to get lost figuring out what you want only to find yourself 28 years old with no idea what to do in life.\n\n9. It is time to watch what you say to others, say too much -- you won't be respected. Ignore everything -- even worse, you won't know shit and feel like an outsider. Things you said will eventually comeback to haunt you and your worth will be determined by how many people you know and how active you are in your circle, your reputation will be everything so protect it with your life. \n\n10. Set clear boundaries with friends, family, lovers. \n\nwe can go all day but off the top of my head, these are the things i can tell you guys. These are my personal views, if you don't agree, no harm no foul. if you got a better idea, do share. Cheers!",

In my early 30\u2019s I finally figured out my dad was a complete narcissistic a-hole who only really cares about himself (never takes time to learn his kids interest, never wants to hear it if we\u2019re having a bad day, etc)\n\nThis was totally disheartening but also very freeing in a way! It\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t have the worlds greatest dad.  Surround yourself with happy, confident people and use them as your mentor/role model/confidants.  \n\nI just wish I learned earlier. It\u2019s scary bc I always looked up to him and admired him. But like I said it\u2019s freeing once you can accept the fact your dad isn\u2019t great but it\u2019s ok.  Plenty of other people to learn from",

I think all men and women should be comfortable being by themselves, then they will find a relationship blooming out of a genuine friendship. If you are needy, there is a chance that you will end up using someone to fill a gap in your life... And that isn't fair on them. Just be yourself rather than trying to copy a stereotype as that isn't fair either, as then they fall for that persona, not you, and the mask has to slip at some stage.",

Because every one has their strong suits, and learning these about people will help you better your own skills. \nBy learning a little bit of what others know, and learning how to master these skills you boost your mental health, confidence, usefulness, physical skills. These things can make you feel like a more useful or purposeful person you can pick up side jobs to make money and learn how to successfully use and spend money to gain long term profits. \nWhen you plan long term it's relaxing cause you're not fearful about later, but instead living in the now.",

Driving stock car/motorcycle is wayyy better, less headache. \n\nI also regret throwing money on vape stuff, I'm going to stop this year and invest more in my fitness. Btw, gym membership is not a waste. I'm not regretting it, except for protein powder and stuff, eat real food, track your micro, invest in a simple weighing scale instead. \n\nIf you don't smoke or drinks u better don't start it, u might said \"I'm not going to be addicted\" etc., but u will end up being depended on those stuff later, which u will regret at one point in your life. Have a simple and healthy life, your late 20's will thank you later.

I can always wait while I develop my interest, hobbies and career.",

            "comment": "9. Time definitely seems to speed up. You will be 30 before you know it, then 40 will roll around. Time seems to pass much more slowly growing up when you're young and you quite rightly assume that this will continue. But it doesn't. Don't assume you 'still have plently of time'. This is normally an excuse to put something difficult off. Your 20's should not be considered a prelude to something else. Assume all you have is your 20s. I'm not saying your life is over when you hit your 30s, definitely not. But you will change. You will probably not have the ambition or drive later in life. Especially if your responsibilities have increased. Door will open when you're older, but some are definitely shut.  \n\n\n10. Don't get into debt. Debt is bondage. It's very easy to get into and very difficult to get out of. Don't go to university unless you are certain that you want to pay the enormous sum of money for the degree. Investigate other options first. Online education etc. If you want life experiences, I strongly recommend travelling. Or even entering the workforce and getting paid. You can get a degree and the debt later. Also consider internships or scholarships where someone else foots the bill.  \n\n\n11. Start working on yourself now. Don't wait until your relationships, job etc have failed until getting therapy etc. Assume that you do and get it. Read about childhood trauma. Assume you have some, I suspect almost everyone does. If you do, it will show up in your life, it already is, but you probably can't see it because you've always lived with it and managed. Don't assume you can keep on 'managing'. Chances are something will come along and sink your battleship. Also don't view it as a chore. Self exploration/improvement is fascinating and will improve all aspects of your life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12. Don't assume that your libido is telling you the truth. PUAs or dating coaches know that the vast majority of men actually want a meaningful relationship with one woman despite what their genitalia seems to be screaming at them. I'm not suggesting you need to monogamous or married, but the chances are what you think you want now isn't actually what you want. You want to find someone worth sacrificing your freedoms for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n13. A good career is all about expertise. Especially niche expertise. If you do something that a lot of other people are doing, then you're always going to have a lot of competition. You're never going to feel any security and your pay will always be average. If you can do something that not a lot of other people can do, then you can charge more, you'll feel more secure in your role and you'll feel much better about yourself. You want to aim at something where it is reasonable to assume that if you work hard in the not too distant future, you will be, or close to, the best person in the room at that specific thing. Not because you want to be an arrogant douche-bag, but because of the reasons I've already mentioned.  \nSo get very good at something. Make sure it is something you enjoy or you will likely be unhappy and you won't be able to be as proficient at it. Working hard at something you enjoy is lots of fun. Working hard at something you hate can be hellish. It's much better to earn less and be happy. Don't get a career in finance if you think you're a arty creative person for example. Unless it's for a couple of years to pay off your student loan and then bounce. But do bounce. Don't get a massive mortgage because you can. Consider contracting early as it pays you fairly in way that a salaried position probably never will.  \n\n\n14. Keep your savings in precious metals. State pensions, company pensions, indexes, equities etc are all extremely vulnerable to bad actors. Precious metals have 5000 years of track record. After that buy land or fine art if you can afford it. The value of everything else goes to zero over time. And a surprisingly short period of time too.",

Did not meet any friends with similar core values throughout my 20s.  I\u2019m basically alone.  I\u2019ve tried and failed MANY times with building stronger friendships.  \n\n2&amp;4). I am a late bloomer.  Life was not how I planned it after high school.  I failed a lot and its only now that I\u2019ve started to build my career and save.  \n\n3) Maturity is an interesting point.  I\u2019m generally respectful/polite/show humility but thats not enough for people to want to hang out with you and do stuff.  I\u2019ve seen plenty of people who are much more immature than I am that are very successful in building friendships and relationships. Although,  I do have my triggers which can push me to act immature but those are rare and very specific situations \n\n5). I have not found a mentor like that.  Most people have come in and out of my life.  I\u2019m someone who is very thankful for anyone is willing to take the time to teach me but i havent met anyone who accepted me for who i was and was willing to stay and be that type of person for me.",

To lay everything out, I\u2019ve never had any kind of job because I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019d be good at anything, I haven\u2019t even taken my driving permit test that you\u2019re supposed to take at 16 because I\u2019ve grown to detest studying for anything not related to school (also because I failed three times already) and academically I used to be at the top of my class but have since burnt out, mainly due to my procrastination catching up with me (I have ADHD although I don\u2019t like using it as an excuse). I didn\u2019t apply to any colleges simply because even though I had the grades I didn\u2019t think any of my teachers would write me a letter of recommendation. I\u2019ve never been a difficult student but I\u2019ve also never been close with any of my teachers or particularly memorable. I haven\u2019t faced or overcome any sort of adversity in my life that would show my character to any colleges, and also I\u2018ve never done anything extracurricular such as volunteer work or clubs, so I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get accepted anywhere based off that. Generally, as you could tell, I feel very behind in life and I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s no one else\u2019s fault but my own. I just don\u2019t really know where to go from here and I feel stuck in my ways. At the same time, I know I\u2019m overthinking some of this and/or am not the only person to experience what I\u2019m experiencing. I\u2019m not looking for any end-all-be-all solutions, but any sort of small tips and advice would be helpful.",

Just take it one step at a time and start scratching things off your list. You will get there. All of us had to start somewhere.",

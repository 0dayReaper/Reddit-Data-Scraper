    "postText": "I know it's unfair to blame a single person for an ED. Truth to be told, I had been binging for a little less than a year by the time I met him. It's a long story, but I met this guy who I liked. He told people he liked me when really he had a girlfriend the whole time. I wasn't supposed to know, but I did. He got mad at our friends for telling me, but cut off contact with me. They broke up not long after, and even though he seemed to like me for a while, he never reached out to me.\n\nHe was the first and only guy to ever like me back. I feel like I'm not good enough. Because if I really were so amazing and wonderful, why would he leave me? I cry about him everyday, and I look in the mirror and think to myself \"if I were prettier, maybe he would've stayed\". For me, binging was never truly about losing weight. It was about stuffing myself until I could no longer feel the emptiness inside me. It doesn't work",

Being with someone who is in a relationship always ends in disaster and is one of the biggest red flags you can get.\n\nYou have so so so many years ahead of you. Adventures. Work. Travel. Lots of things. It hurts but each day try and move on.",

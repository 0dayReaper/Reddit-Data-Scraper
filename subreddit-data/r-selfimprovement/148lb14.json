    "postText": "So about a year and a half ago i got into self improvement and self help. This phase was absolutely amazing and helped me feel so good about myself and life (won\u2019t get to into it).\nBut for last couple of months i\u2019ve slowly lost confidence/motivation/overall happiness. I now feel obsessed with becoming my best person but doing nothing about it which has turned into a pretty toxic circle in which i am always overthinking and overanalysing, leading to me feeling as if i\u2019m stuck in my head and never in the moment. This has lead to me been much worse socially and never been able to have a fun conversation which is my at the expense of someone else while also drinking quite a lot as almost a coping mechanism. \n\nI don\u2019t want to become the perfect person like i once wanted to be, but i want to work hard whilst also enjoying myself. How do i slowly start building this up again \n\nfor info i\u2019m going to gym first time in a couple of weeks + if anyone has questions feel free to ask since i think i\u2019ve been pretty vague, but i judt wanted to get my thoughts out.",

During my journey I\u2019ve found out that self improving should be something that you constantly do everyday with little things, and not try to change your live in one day. It\u2019s completely normal that u don\u2019t feel motivated at times, but I\u2019m sure that you know what type of stuff u have improved since the beginning and it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t fall back to the old version of yourself and still do the things you\u2019ve changed and improved on. Going to the gym sounds like a very good idea to me now and just keep on doing the things you like - over time everything will be better just don\u2019t expect a 180 degree flip to it",

My goal is to do challenges relating to personal development (e.g. - ice baths, 5am wakeups?!, etc.), record them, and then give my take on whether or not they are actually meaningful!\r  \n\r  \nThink of it as a sort of personal-development mythbusters...\r  \n\r  \nFrom you, I need any and all (feasible) challenges in the comments below!\r  \n\r  \nThank you for helping to ruin my sleep schedule and hope everyone has a great summer!",

            "comment": "If you like to draw, you might enjoy creating something like Inktober (Colouring and drawing are said have a number of mental health benefits).   \n\n\nIf you like writing, and penning a book of your own is important to you, consider Camp NaNoWriMo (writing a novel or memoir is on the bucketlists of many). This challenge spurs participants on to create a 50k-word manuscript.  The community is super supportive.   \n\n\nAnd then there's the  Mins game, a month long decluttering challenge hosted by The Minimalists (you can watch their documentary on Netflix if you want). This challenges urges you to get rid of one item on day 1, two on day 2, three on day 3, and so on till day 30.  \n\n\nFinally,  consider running. Another life goal for many is to run a marathon (or 1/2 marathon or even a 10 or 5k), and of course there are many physical and mental health benefits that come with running.  \n\n\nThat's all I got for now. \n\nBest of luck, and have a great Summer  :)",

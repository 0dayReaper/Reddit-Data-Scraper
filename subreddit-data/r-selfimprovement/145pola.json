    "postText": "Alright so I had a period of severe burnout and feeling lost af. I just did absolutely nothing for a while bc I was terrified of failure, still am. So I made a pact with myself to do everything, but do them shittily. I gave myself the pass.\n\nNow, I still don't feel motivated at all to do anything, I'd rather stay at home and watch Netflix all day everyday, and sometimes I do. But I do *almost* everything that needs to be done, badly and half-assed, which surprisingly works! I did a ton of shit in a week that needed to be done a couple of years ago. Weirdly, I also don't feel good about it, maybe just for a second if I'm lucky but that's it.\n\nAll this just sounds very interesting, I don't know why I'm doing anything, I still don't feel it in me. Would really appreciate your feedback and experiences on this.",

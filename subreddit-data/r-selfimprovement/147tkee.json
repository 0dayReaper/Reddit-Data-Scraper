    "postText": "\nI (25F) have a really questionable relationship with the gym and fitness in general. I have a violent distaste for exercise, but of course I want to lose weight. \n\nMost times after coming back from the gym I usually cry for a long time after or have panic attacks(I do have an anxiety disorder as well) and it really demotivates me. If it\u2019s a really bad day I cry during my workout. It\u2019s to the point where my husband (who is really into fitness) begs me not to go because I get so down and not myself when I\u2019m attempting to maintain a regular gym routines. Over the years I have had stints where I go to the gym consistently for months and see some results, but because of how upsetting going to the gym is for me I end up quitting. I have even tried at home workouts and that has the same result as going to the gym. Exercising in general ruins my entire day and really throws me into a depressive state. \n\nDoes anyone have these issues or any advice so I can actually stick with my gym routines without feeling so terrible after?",

            "comment": "You should ask yourself exactly what part of exercise is anxiety-inducing. For a lot of people, it\u2019s the gym environment but since at-home workouts are stressful for you too, I\u2019m guessing it isn\u2019t just that. Exercising doesn\u2019t just have to be running on a treadmill or lifting weights. There a lot of different ways to exercise: walks in nature, bicycling, dance classes, swimming, even playing Just Dance on the Wii. If applicable, find one that you enjoy and stick to it because it\u2019s fun. Try and make exercise seem like a \u201cWANT to do\u201d and not a \u201cHAVE to do\u201d. Even if it\u2019s unconventional, moving your body is always good.",

Without going into detail, it turned into a dangerous situation with my food intake and exercise regime so I had to stop.",

It's this cool app where you set tasks and if you don't complete them, you lose some money. It adds a bit of extra motivation and accountability to stick with your gym routine. Give it a try and see if it helps you stay on track without feeling so terrible afterward. And remember, it's okay to explore different forms of exercise too, like dancing, hiking, or whatever makes you happy. Just find what works for you and enjoy the process of getting active.",

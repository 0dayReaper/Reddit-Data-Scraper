    "postText": "So, just got rejected from a the second girl I liked... like ever lol. Broke my ego, got me sad, and a little annoyed thst i havent dated when it seems like everyone else did. So, I'm trying to get into self improvement and become the best version of myself. Dunno this sub is the place for this, but I figured I'd come here to ask for help because I don't know what else I need to do aside from what I do now. I'm a pretty good student, and I've been waking up at 5:40 to go to the gym and spend my day interning at a lab until 5. What can I do to improve my social skills, physique, and overall mental health? My main 4 goal is\n\n- continue off social media (deleted everything a couple weeks ago)\n- get off this one forum website\n- confidence to talk to girls and overall socials (new friends maybe, left my old group a bit ago)\n- porn/mastrubating addiction gone\n\nThank you!",

Journaling and meditation are really good for mental health, can provide self awareness and confidence also. You might research nutrition a bit so you know what foods will best help your physique goals. Social skills is mostly a practice thing, but the book How to Win Friends and Influence People is a tremendous education in how to be a good listener and be graceful and interesting in conversation. It was a game changer for me. You're on the right track! Wishing you all the best!",

You can ask for those to be included in the shopping list and ask for help learning to cook a few dishes. Great skill to have and baking chicken with a simple seasoning on it is super easy. Bonus points if you have an air fryer or learn to grill. Then heat up veggies from a can with some soy sauce and you have a healthy meal. Cooking your own eggs is another good one to learn, and as you study nutrition you'll learn subtle changes that affect calories and flavor. All of this is trial and error, but what you learn will be in your tool box forever.\n\nMeditate in the morning, journal before bed. I do them every day and it helps me process what's going on, manage stress, and feel better overall. By the way that book I mentioned is exceptionally helpful in talking to women. Being a good listener is not common and women really appreciate it, this book will teach you that.",

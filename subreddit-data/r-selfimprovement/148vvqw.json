    "postText": "I\u2019m currently a senior in college about to graduate after next semester but i\u2019m honestly tired of being stuck financially. I have been living with my parents and have been struggling with finances due to having to pay for my schooling and certain bills. I used to just enjoy college working out and hookup with girls having the most fun. Now i\u2019m trying to get out of that mindset and start growth in my finances. I have set up a business to where I make 80-200 Dollars a month that is my real passion but it\u2019s simply not enough to sustain a lifestyle yet. Applying for jobs like crazy but it\u2019s honestly been hard to secure anything besides Fedex ground (you get worked like a dog I wouldn\u2019t recommend). My fitness is top tier and I read daily for the last 2 months. I just need advice on how I can get my independence and stop struggling with my income. This is my first post so sorry if this is a hard read.",

It\u2019s more philosophical than practical guide, but vital to developing a solid perspective on what money is-captured time.",

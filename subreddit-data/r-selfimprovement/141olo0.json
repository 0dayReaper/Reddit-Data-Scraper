    "postText": "I don\u2019t know where to start this post at all. I want to go straight to point and not make it a pity party, but there are some things worth mentioning.\n\nFor whatever reason, I feel like I cannot improve. I have been on self improvement for almost 6 years now. I heard about it since I was a sophomore in high school, I was about 14 years old, I am now 20. Yet, I virtually haven\u2019t made any significant improvements in my life. I am in the exact same place, maybe even worse place, than I was 6 years ago. Whenever I make good progress, it doesn\u2019t last and ends after a month or two if I\u2019m lucky. I can\u2019t seem to get myself to do things that are beneficial to me or productive. \n\nI don\u2019t workout, despite the fact I have a gym membership. I\u2019ve been paying for it for almost a year now but I probably went about 2 months worth of days. Getting in shape has been a main goal of mine for years, yet I have never came close to achieving it.\n\nI struggle to stick to my goals. I struggle to overcome social anxiety and be social. Maybe it has to do with the bullying I\u2019ve faced when I was so young. I remember being the most social and energetic person you would know, until it was all beaten out of me by bullies. They forced me to muzzle myself to avoid attention and potential attacks on me and I haven\u2019t been the same since. The once outgoing kid is now the quietest in the room, fearing any form of attention. I can\u2019t even go outside most days without a friend with me. I want to be social but I can\u2019t. \n\nThe effects of bullying doesn\u2019t stop there, I have been called ugly numerous times and mocked for my appearance, and I am plagued with insecurities. They flood my mind whenever I\u2019m outside and out of my comfort zone. The thoughts don\u2019t leave me. I never feel present. It is exhausting.\n\nI address my past because I believe maybe it has some correlation with how I\u2019m doing now? I can\u2019t win. I have been going nowhere but downhill the past years. I am tired of it, yet I still don\u2019t change. It has gone to the point where I believe something is wrong with me, even though I don\u2019t want that to be true. Am I just being a bitch? If so, then how can I overcome this? Should I just accept my fate of being less than ordinary? Less than average? I don\u2019t want that to be true, after everything I\u2019ve been through. I don\u2019t know. This post is almost my last resort.",

It completely destroy me, and I'm not even close to recovering from it. But I have started. I went from being 290lbs, sitting in my room all day only leaving to get snacks or use the bathroom, and doing nothing but playing video games and jerking off. Now I'm almost 100 pounds down, I go outside regularly, and I am focused on catching up on school online. My best piece of advice is to take it one step at a time. Start small and work your way up. For example with losing weight I just started by cutting out pop and chips. I didn't count calories. I didn't workout. I still sat in my room pretty much all day. But I started, and when I was ready I started doing more. Don't rush yourself or you will keep failing. Self-improvement takes time so be patient. If you do fail, don't feel guilty. Forgive yourself, and try again. I failed lots of times when it came to losing weight, but I kept on trying until it worked. And trust me it gets so much easier. My motivation feels infinite after losing 100 pounds. I wake up at 4am to workout first thing in the morning. Last year I was lucky if I even got out of bed lol. \n\nAnyways I'm doing ranting lol. Hope this helps :)",

    "postText": "I'm currently 23 and I've been trying to live my early 20's to the fullest. I've been going out more since I turned 21; going out to bars, parties and concerts. I'm also the first person in the family to throw a party.\n\nBecause of this, my family has been telling me I'm a social butterfly. They all went out in their 20's but not as much as I have and honestly, it's made me very happy. I was always a very shy kid, trying my best to not talk to anybody and was happy when I didn't have any friends. I also didn't care much about my weight so I put on a lot and was 300 in high school.\n\nNow, I have more friends than I can count and working in retail has trained me on how to talk to people. I still have a weight problem but I'm losing it. I'm also putting more effort into my wardrobe, no more sweat pants and calling it a day for me.\n\nBeing a social person is who I've always wanted to be. I want to look back on my life and be able to tell my children and grandchildren about my past life. Having a hundred stories to tell where none of them sound the same.",

The same way that you don\u2019t have final say over people but still be a kind human being one can also work towards outcomes without linking their whole identity on it.",

There are also some truths that people can interpret and make their lives worse. \n\nThat also being said, like a baby being thrown out the nest, we might not even be able to piece together the lesson. I\u2019m reminded of this cartoon about King Arther  (as a kid) where he asked Merlin what to say to a girl he liked and Merlin just said \u201clove her\u201d. Arther sang a song asking if he should give her flowers or write a note, and Merlin kept replying only to \u201clove her\u201d. \n\nPlus there\u2019s also that fallacy about not taking advice because of the messenger. If a smoker tells you not to smoke or if a poor man tells you how to get rich, they might have good information that you wouldn\u2019t know. Only way to verify the truth is to have done it or understanding it.",

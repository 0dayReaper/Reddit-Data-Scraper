    "postText": "I started smoking for self improvement. And it worked. It was pure bliss everything was going well I was doing good at work at home etc etc but I'm realizing that the sense of bliss is gone and I'm spending a shit load of money on weed. A few days ago I was looking to buy a video game and realized I spent to much money on weed to afford it without dipping into my \"needs\" money. I spent all my \"wants\" money on weed and I'm thinking about quitting for the month and regrouping my finances. My question is if I should stop for longer? I do feel like Marijuana is good for my life but i fear I'm becoming addicted if I'm spending more and more money on weed then I would use to.",

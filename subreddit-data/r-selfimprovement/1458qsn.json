    "postText": "Hi friends, I don't know if this is the right sub, but I'm looking for healthy alternatives to sugar and sweets. I consume a lot of really bad-for-me things, and it's starting to show. I've added a little bit of exercise to counter my intake, but honestly it's negated, I feel. Does anyone know of things that can fulfil the sweet craving but are better for me? TIA",

You can use them in baking recipes, smoothies or just drizzle over your fruit. You can also turn frozen fruit into a sorbet. Whatever comes to mind. These are just some ideas.",

Doesn't have to be a lot of money. This isn't really about the money, it's more just about being somewhat more productive with my time than I currently am.\n\nI'm just looking for something I can do, myself, from home, that's monotonous, and a grind. That monotony is key for me since I'm physically unable to do much.\n\nI'm unable in dealing with other people consistently. I'm unable in having to leave too often to complete outside tasks.\n\nI'm looking to have a daily commitment, from home, for 3-6 hours that requires me to \" grind \" and do whatever the task is at hand, In exchange for some money or the future potential of money, regardless of how much.\n\nI'm willing to invest time to try and build something, by putting in the hours, even with a low success rate of success, but with some potential upside.\n\nI'm good with the computer, can type fast, can navigate well , I think I am reasonably intelligent and can learn things somewhat quickly.\n\nAny advice/ideas/guidance is greatly appreciated",

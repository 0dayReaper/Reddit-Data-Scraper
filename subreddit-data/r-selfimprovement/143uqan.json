    "postText": "I've realise through out my life I have had moments I have pushed myself beyond the limits of my body and I have felt an extreme clamness and lack of anxiety afterwards. I never realised I enjoyed it as much as I did until I read Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins. I now do something I Hate everyday something that pushs what I think I can't do. and it makes me feel great. I don't think it is for everyone but there is something to be said for the drive and passion I put into my everday life. Everyday I feel accomplished and present and I am happy to be alive and I wish more people felt the way I do. I think it has to do with searching within yourself to find what drives you and makes you happy. I wish you find what makes you fufilled in life, I truly do. let this post act as a reminder to think thoughtfully upon your life and what makes you truly happy, to strive for an ideal version of yourself, or to never give up.",

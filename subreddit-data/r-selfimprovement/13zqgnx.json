    "postText": "I am turning 18 soon, I live in a small town. By next school year (starts at sept 2023) I will be in grade 12. I do not need to go to school for second semester (January-June 2024) because I would finish all the classes I need to graduate by first semester. Meaning, I have five months of free time before I graduate. Now, which option is better?\n\nFirst option: Live in a bigger city where there are more opportunities, rent a place there, live alone, work 9-5 every weekdays, learn about money (passive income) or a skill after work or when I have free time. Pros: I get to learn how to be independent. Cons: I know it is going to be tough and half of my income would go to expenses (rent, food, etc.)\n\nSecond option: Stay in a small town where I am currently at and live with my parents. Same thing, work 9-5 every weekdays, learn about money (passive income) or a skill after work or when I have free time. Pros: I get to save more money because I have less expense than living alone in a city. Cons: I would still be depending on my parents which means I would not be independent as much as when I live alone.",

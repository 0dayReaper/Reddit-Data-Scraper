Any ways for me to build strength to get a normal pushup? \n\nI have been training my arms and shoulders with dumbbells and it has helped a little.\n\nThanks for the advice :)",

            "comment": "Look into bodyweight training if you don't want to join a gym or buy the equipment to start lifting weights at home. There's plenty of progressions that you can use to build up to proper pushups and eventually to the one armed variant.\n\nBut the simplest way to progress is by increasing rep numbers. And by doing multiple sets for each exercise. So instead of trying to do as many pushups as you can at once, try to do 3 sets of 8 or however many you manage. If you can only do 5 or less, then try doing 5 sets. That way you can get enough volume in to make progress.\n\nBut that stuff is absolutely basic knowledge that you need to acquire if you want to make any progress with any type of training. So you should read up on it yourself. The bodyweight board here is a good source, but also the book they recommend there, \"Overcoming Gravity\". It's quite expensive but it really covers all the basics that you need to get started and to create your own workout routine. So if you have no clue yet but would like to learn how to work out properly and would like to do bodyweight exercises, which you can also do outside, then that book would be a great start. As long as you're okay with reading through hundreds of pages, though there's example workout plans for beginners in the book and on the reddit board that you could use to get started, then take your time to read the book.",

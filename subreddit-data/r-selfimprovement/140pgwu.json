    "postText": "There is nothing more harmful to the body, spirit, and soul than the serrated fangs of regret. As of May 6th, 2023, I am haunted by regret. No matter how much I have grown, and how much I have learned, I am still being followed by a looming shadow of pain and sorrow. Today I heard a story from a man who died, passed over to the Great Spiritual, and came back. During a relatively routine surgery, nothing too invasive, a nurse made an error when adjusting the pressure of blood moving throughout his body and consequently, stopped his heart. Stricken with panic and fear, the nurse ran through the halls screaming \u201cI killed him! I killed him!\u201d\n\nAt this point, the man spoke of his spirit leaving the body, and just became an observation of the surgery. Whilst watching his own surgery, he was joined by an unknown humanoid figure. We can safely assume this is some form of Psychopomp, and a silent one at that. Once it was time to move on, he was instructed to never look back, and follow the figure. With agreeance, he then found himself in a beautiful plot of land, surrounded with flowers that were more plentiful and vibrant than one could ever imagine. Then, a white cloud accumulates.\n\nThe man looked into this cloud and proceeded to watch his life over again. Every moment since the point of birth was observed. Every joyous occasion. Every gut-wrenching, horrific tragedy. Every perfect kiss. Every accomplishment and mistake. It was at this point in the story that I began thinking about when I am in that situation. I sit here at this computer with puffy eyes because I know now, for certainty, that I don\u2019t want to look into the cloud. I am ashamed of the life that I lead. Cowardly, emotionally stunted, and so mentally burdened with regret and fear that every day is an obstacle course of stabilization just to do the bare necessities.\n\nI worry about meeting the psychopomp. Silent as they may be, I still worry about the looming energetic disappointment that they will understandably exude. I worry that all of my regret will eat and consume my very being until I am digested and expunged from this vessel into worthless remains. Caput mortuum. As such, I will allow myself this room to speak of my regret, so that it may go through that process instead.\n\nI regret my anger as a child. It made me cruel, and bitter. Even to those who wanted nothing but to help me and care for me. I regret not showing my father how much he means to me. No one deserves to hear those three words moreso than him. I regret never tapping into my ambition. The severe lack of drive and motivation have stifled amazing opportunities for me countless times. I regret not being the partner I should have been. The anger from childhood persisted, and as such, I became a source of worry and frustration for her rather than a source of support, love, and safety. I regret not being able to bring my family back together after making the already-present schism worse. I regret not being more open with my singing, even though it is an aspect of life that I am incredibly passionate about. I regret not spending more time with my late uncle who passed away earlier last month. He was a gentle soul who experienced a lot of grief within the last few years; I feel he is finally at peace.\n\nAll of this is to say, I don\u2019t have to carry around regret. I never did, and I never have to again. I will be keeping the story I heard today in mind for as long as I need to for it to sink in and cement into my mind. Life is unpredictable, it\u2019s short, and it\u2019s brutal. However, all of what we experience has a purpose, and it is always for our betterment. It is so we can smile at the psychopomp. It is so we can smell the flowers in the perfect meadow and experience all the wonder it has to offer. It is so we can reach into the cloud to feel the freedom inside with bliss.\n\nThe purpose of Life is to Live.\n\nThe purpose of Regret is to stop you from Living it.",

It\u2019s a double edged sword because people often get worried about having regret on their finals days, but it also makes every human realize his mortality. Is Alive defined as physically alive?(Heart beating, blood moving) or mentally alive? (Experiencing many emotions, both good and bad)\n\nNot to get ahead of myself but I wanna thank you for taking the time to write this.",

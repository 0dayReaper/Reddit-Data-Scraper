    "postText": "I have gone through a depressive era during my entire school year(almost entirely). And that includes college.\n\nProblem is, because of that - I don't know how to be disciplined. My GPA is like 3.1/4.5. And I'm about to graduate soon. Very soon. Next semester would be my last one. And I'm pretty sure I successfully ruined this semester.\n\nI'm majoring in graphic design. But my portfolio looks like that of a junior student. My attention span is wrecked.\n\nIs there still any hope?",

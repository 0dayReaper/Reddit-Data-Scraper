    "postText": "hey there\n\nI need some advice. \n\nIm a generally distracted person. I took a gap year, mainly to get some real world experience, and my job as a waitress showed me how impractical I am.\n\nIm friendly, I smile at people, but I get stressed out, or just plain blank out, when it comes to real situations. \n\nIm frustrated with this part of me, and I genuinely want to improve. it feels like my mind and body are unaligned; I dont speak up to defend myself; I say stupid things which I dont mean.\n\nI meditate, and this has helped me immensely in other areas, but this part of me remains the same..\n\nI pray that theres someone out there who has had the same problem, and has found practical ways to overcome it. Or at least that they eventually outgrew it.\n\nthank you ",

Do you want to like yourself?\n\nWhat if you didn\u2019t have to rest your mind on liking yourself or not?",

What question even is that?? \n\nI do work on accepting myself.\n\nDistinguish between accepting the parts of me I dont like and liking myself.",

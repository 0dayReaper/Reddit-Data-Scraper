    "postText": "17M here and  my 2 best friends in high-school kinda broke contact with me. Ever since then I've been searching for people to replace them(I do have 'friends' ofcos but we don't share much in common and we barely talk). My only option is online since the college I go to all the students speak zulu. So im kinda isolated although they do talk to me once in a while in english. I've tried to make 'close' friends on reddit and discord but they either dry, end up ghosting me, take super long to reply or barely come online.\n\nI just want a buddy to talk to at the end of the day uk. Talk abt our hobbies, goals, send memes and stuff. \nI also have ntg in common with my family so I can't really have deep meaningful conversations with them.\n\nSo after trying and trying online to make close friends(wasting hours and hours) im giving up and I wanna try to end this craving. I do have lots of things to do: college work, exercise and playing guitar but that longing for that friendship or desire for deep meaningful social interaction never seems to fade. Smt weird i also noticed is that I don't feel like sleeping unless I have like a decent convo with someone before bed.\n\nSo how do I end this craving? Cos just doing other stuff to keep me busy doesn't make it go away.\n\nAppreciate any advice \ud83d\ude4c",

I can't stay alone either..so i keep on searching for good friends. You can talk to me if you want to. And are your college mates speaking Tulu?",

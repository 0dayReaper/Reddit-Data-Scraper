    "postText": "i had anorexia for 4 years. it was the most lonely and exhausting time of my life. i was forced into treatment and i am now a healthy weight (which i\u2019m maintaining) and although disordered thoughts are still there, i act on them less. \n\ni recently got a full time job and my relationship with my family is better. i am 23 (got ill at 18) and feel like i\u2019ve missed out on so many things; never had the college experience, no dating, no friends, no holidays.\n\nall i do is go to work, therapy and home. i want to start living my life, feeling really behind and would love some wise words.",

            "comment": "I had anorexia too. Diagnosed at 17 and by 18 my body gained all his normal function and normal blood test. I didn't go into hospitalization for it, but I got on AD for social anxiety.\n\nAnyway, I'm 25 now. I still have some \"anorexic thoughts\" but the thoughts have almost no power on me, they don't have any influence, so it's fine. \n\nI mostly got through life by trying. Sometime, I failed and sometimes I got it my way. Today while I look successful from the outside I'm still trying to get better in my own way and rhythm. I accepted that I won't be perfect or the best, I am just one human in like 8 billions. There's no age limit to get better. there's no expiration date on starting school, having a new job, having relationships or starting a new hobby or project.\n\nHope this helps a bit. Good luck!",

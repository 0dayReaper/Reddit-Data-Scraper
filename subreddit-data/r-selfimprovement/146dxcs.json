    "postText": "I feel like there are so many pros and cons to it. Of course overall I'd say I'd LIKE to phase out of using it altogether at some point, but in the meantime while I'm 25, that doesn't seem extremely urgent I suppose. \n\nOn one hand, of course I love the way it makes me feel and it genuinely helps me zoom out on certain situations in life with a seemingly clearer perspective. Sometimes it really seems to help me make cool and/or mind-blowing realizations about myself, and it helps me search my soul for what I truly want out of life. Those moments are always just awesome, and whether or not they're super legit... it just feels good to know oneself more and more. \n\nOn the other hand though. I feel like since 2023 has started, I've begun using it more than before (getting quite high approx. 3, maybe 4 times a month on average), but have also run into more mental problems than before. I find myself just sort of wallowing in my own failures/shortcomings, and feeling resentment toward people who remind me of them. I really can't tell if it's a coincidence or not. Plus I have a tonnn of shame around it. Honestly very few people know I actually get high, as most of my friends just don't do it and sometimes even sort of look down on people who actually do. So of course sometimes I'll get paranoid that I'm just a fraud to them, or soon they'll find out and judge me, stuff like that. And last but not least, I just hateeeeee how sapped of energy it makes me feel the next day, and not to mention how frickin tired I still look and feel for that whole day. I know weed hangovers aren't a thing but I guess sometimes I have a habit of getting so high that it carries over to the next day. \n\nIdk. I guess my big thing is that I'm really wanting to work on coming across as more professional and put-together than before, and obviously getting high does not do me any favors in that department. I guess I really had no problem with weed at first, but for some reason now I'm starting to understand some of its problems. ",

I am extremely cautious about weed because ei know I have a past of abusing substance. That being said, I was at a loss to find anything to help my migraines and had one for two weeks and was literally suffering so much that I had my fiance go get me weed to see if it'll help. Surely enough, I took one puff and it started to ease my pain. So now, for the last two months, i smoke a hit or two of weed once per night only when I get home from work and it's right before I hop into bed. My mood is better, my migraines are less tense. It's a game changer. I hate when I accidentally take to big of a hit because I hate being too high. Micro dosing is the way",

On one hand I am fascinated by the collective denial going on about the harm it causes. We have decades of research about the harm it causes to the brain, especially the frontal lobe.  On the other hand I understand why people collectively want to numb themselves. \n\nMy question would be for the times when have realizations about yourself are you able to hold onto them and and do something with them?  \n\nCannabis use disorder is a real thing, and an early sign is that you are finding yourself using more and needing to get higher.  Not saying that\u2019s what you have going on, but if you are trying to make a conscious decision about weed, I would check this out.  Look at your personal risk factors, and really examine your relationship with any substance.  \n\nWeed is a system depressant, so yes it absolutely causes a type of hangover.  Anytime we use a system depressant it dampens our neurological system through the body.  As the substance works out of the system, it feels bad generally people feel more irritable, down, foggy/fatigued, and anxious.  Where we can get pulled into the cycle is we then don\u2019t want to feel that way, so we use again.  \n\nWeed is interesting because it\u2019s also a psychedelic as well.  So it has the potential to causes very serious psychiatric symptoms in folks who may be prone.  But for many it starts to cause increasing paranoia and anxiety.  \n\n Check out Judith Grisel\u2019s Ted Talk - all drugs end up causing the precisely opposite feeling state we are striving for. And look for the harmful effects, not just the positive.",

Everyone reacts differently to individual substances. \n\nI have spent years convincing myself that I \u201clike\u201d smoking weed. The truth is that I am in a fog the entire next day even if I have extremely small amounts, I am extremely paranoid if I smoke with others even my best friends, and it effects my thought process immensely and unpredictably. Sometimes it helps me settle a conflict in my life, but mostly it creates a sense of panic that I\u2019m not doing enough or am completely ruining my life when absolutely nothing is out of place. \n\nI have been struggling with the conflict of eliminating alcohol from my life (I definitely have my fathers alcoholic genetics which decides to pop up in my 30\u2019s), and from listening to many podcasts on the topic the question that you need to ask yourself is:\n\nDoes this substance serve you, and if not, what are you going to change?",

Missing out on one of the most important sleep phases is not good for mental health long term. REM is linked to memory as well.\n\nSmoking weed makes nothing to do, something to do. It makes something that was boring more entertaining. Doing that long enough makes parts of you atrophy because you dont need to TRY to attain happiness. Like progressively saying no more and more each year when friends invite you out, youd rather be lazy and take the easy happiness by staying home and smoking. You start \"saying no\" to a lot of other things in your life if you know what i mean, weed becomes the beginning and end of your happiness choices.\n\nAlso if you get tolerant to weed youre actually getting tolerant to the feelings weed gives. If weed makes you happy you will get tolerant to happiness and get depressed. You cant press the happy button 10000 times and have it not wear out for the same reason you cant win the lottery 10000 times and be as excited as you were the first time you won.",

CBD helps relieve depression, anxiety,neuropathy problems and has many other benefits due to our bodies being cannabinoid based in the first place. THC is what gets you high and causes negative effects if abused.If you're planning on having a battle of wits,sorry to say but you are ill equipped and need to actually do some research.",

And each strain is a different cocktail and has a unique effect. The science on it is new so there is alot they don't know (or ever will), \n\nTry different strains and how it will affect you personally. (everybody will react differently)\n\nTo be clear headed and accomplish my goals. I found Afghan strains are great for that. I also like Jack Herrer, some purple strains, sour diesel, haze, sage, blue dream...\n\nTalk to your local dispensary.",

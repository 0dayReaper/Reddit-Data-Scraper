Very rarely do we recieve an update of the OP's confirming they did anything like report or take legal action, and so it just feels like this endless loop of people complaining, getting everyone riled up, and then it gets forgotten about a day or two later. \n\nI know their isn't much a single person can do, and everyone has right to vent their frustrations, but subs like workersrevolt, antiwork, subs made for 'strikes' like the maydaystrike sub, they all pride themselves on being movements, but I'm not really seeing much change because of them. Yeah, perhaps its got people talking more about not taking crap from businesses, and helped get people thinking of strikes, but none of the current strikes can be contributed to the existence of these subs, they just pass around the info that they're happening.

I can't help but think that choosing to do nothing, or live in ignorance, exacerbates the problem.\n\nFor example, I just quit my job in December after years of being miserable and feeling like it was just me. Seeing so many ppl also struggling helped me to make a better choice for myself, and now I am a stay at home dad. I can apply my skills to be self employed, which I will. Money is currently a little tight but living without the capitalist push to earn is great. I'm working on de-programming the social stigma of self worth being attached fltonhownkuch I can earn. \n\nas stressful as it is, reading the news tells me the narrative rather than the facts. And in seeing that I can make better choices for myself and family. I can even play their game better. Make better investments for example.\n\nIdk to me, that's what they want. They want complacency and for us all to get tired, and to play the game. They want us to do what I did above, snap and judge and dismiss and spur hate. But that's because we all have so much hate and anger right now, rightfully so, they just want it directed at anyone but themselves.\n\nSo I am going to stay angry. And I'm going to remind myself every day who I am angry at. But that's my choice",

We shouldn't consider what they want. If you think about it, it's almost silly to decide to *not* be happy because that's what *they* want. When we say this, aren't we blindly following our ego?\n\nThere are nuances here, and I can see how sometimes you can do something, but life is too short, and people we hold dear are too important for us to spend our time being angry at someone who might not even know about us.",

What the people in these subreddits are proposing is a kind of systemic change in our economic system, a process that would require years in order for there to come about some kind of radical change.\n\n I don't think it's mandatory to follow those principles in your day to day life. You can maintain a stoic/humble outlook on your everyday life while actively advocating for systemic change. Unless you're some kind of political activist who's career relies on these subjects, of course.\n\nI agree to some extent that the ideas that these subreddits advocate for could potentially have some kind of negative impact on somebody's life, but overall I think it's a good, honest criticism of today's society.\n\nUnfortunately though, it i simply a statistical fact thay most people will never become \"rich\", whatever that means. Here's a quote that I like ( paraphrased) : \"In today's society, the average worker doesn't recognize that he is being exploited by the system, he thinks he's just a temporarily embarrassed millionaire.\"",

I understand the logic however if you can do it in a \u201csimpler\u201d situation that doesn\u2019t mean you can do it in a harder one. If you can do it now then you can do it with less \u201cdistractions\u201d. Be weary not to romanize this because it\u2019s a great victory to do it this way, in this moment, not in a fantasy. \n\nAll our \u201cexcuses\u201d, which are actually valid reasons we belittle, will still exist even in such a situation. The actual skill worth it\u2019s weight is addressing those judgments.",

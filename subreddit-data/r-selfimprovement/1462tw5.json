I've always been there for them and have always treated them with respect.\n\nAny advice?",

            "comment": "My advice:\n\nWork on yourself, real good friends will come along the way.\n\nI say that for two reasons:\n\n1.) Trying is something I personally have never done with making friends,, it just sort of happens. I'm not saying it's bad or wrong to try, but I could see how a strong desire of friends would make someone's attempts come off as desperate or maybe it would cause people to sense something that is off putting.\nIf friends were made by some forced effort, what does that say about the friendship? It should be a natural \"click\", that's how real friends should be.\n\n2.) Working on yourself and staying busy will do a few things; it will keep you occupied and distracted from your current negative feelings, even if not completely, it should significantly reduce how strongly it's making you feel. Another reason is you'll feel better about yourself and gain some confidence. Confidence manifests itself in your body language, the way you talk, etc...and in turn, may very well draw potential friends to you.",

Additionally, people have different personalities and interests, so it can be challenging to find individuals who share similar values and hobbies.\n\nTo make new friends, you can try joining clubs or organizations that align with your interests, attending social events or gatherings, or volunteering in your community. Additionally, you can try reaching out to acquaintances or coworkers to hang out outside of work.",

            "comment": "More of an advice for on the side - but make use of the halo effect. It's basically the psychological principle that humans are more attracted to people who are pretty. They tend to associate good characteristics with them like honesty, integrity etc.\n\nTo make use of this I recommend to take a look at yourself and see if there are any things you can improve or perhaps get rid of. Get clothes that fit well, learn the basics of style and matching outfits, get a haircut, start wearing perfume, get in shape, etc etc.\n\nOn the other hand there might also be things about you that could throw off other people. Some examples I know are: smelling like sweat all the time, oily and messy hair, unkept fingernails, always being negative, clothes that don't fit at all, bad breath, no eye contact.",

Even if it wasn't my personal opinion. I've always been one to stand up for others. Recently I've found that \"no you are wrong\" and \"or, what if\"  are accepted completely differently. Instead of putting someone else on defense you can engage deeper and make more solid connections rather than sparks that immediately fizzle and fly off. Just my personal experience.",

Feeling like you're getting singled out can really suck. \n\nMy advice is to realize that sometimes the vibes we get from people aren't entirely about them in the moment. Like, if you've had a bad experience with snakes, seeing a plastic tube could freak you out, but someone else might be totally fine. Same thing can happen in our interactions with others. Just remember that sometimes our emotions aren't 100% because of the other person or what's happening right then and there.\n\nThis is important because once you get it, you'll also realize that sometimes people's reactions to our actions aren't entirely our fault. They're just projecting their own vibes onto us and some of their own emotions are getting stirred up again. \n\nAnd once you learn to love yourself for real, you'll start to love other people in a pure and genuine way and find them interesting. If you're constantly judging yourself harshly, you'll treat the world and other people that way too. And if you're always judging the world and other people, you'll have a hard time accepting yourself with compassion.\n\nI'm sorry that you're getting so much negativity from others instead of love. I know that sometimes, no matter how much advice you get, it can be tough to feel better.\n\nAt least for now, when you see this message, know that I care about you. I genuinely hope you can feel the love without any conditions. \u2764",

            "comment": "Coming from an older woman, here are some things I\u2019ve learned:\n\n1- Friends are found by frequenting the same location. It\u2019s impossible to grow a relationship otherwise.\n\n2- Most people who visit that location will not become your friends. This is for a whole host of reasons. But just expect it.\n\n3- Friendships, for the most part, have seasons. You might be friends with someone for a year and then they meet a lover and you rarely talk to them again. As life evolves, they will fade away. You best accept this.\n\n4- Strong friendships are forged through a mutual \u201clife goal\u201d or \u201clife problem\u201d \u2014 for instance, two friends are struggling newlyweds. Through their friendship they communicate and explore their core pains and complaints. If one person \u201csolves\u201d it, they move on from the friendship.\n\n5- Trust must be built before friendships become truly useful. The process of making friends is an exercise in building and repairing trust rifts. If a large rift in trust happens early on, the friendship will be at face value or won\u2019t continue at all.\n\n6- Most strong friendships graduate to the \u201cset it and forget it\u201d mode. Meaning, after the two have graduated from their mutual problem, they will check in on occasion, and catch up, but they will not be a huge part of eachother\u2019s lives like before. These are really healthy friendships because they are based on trust and giving but not dependent.\n\n7- Friendships have a difficult time forming if there are serious value differences and both parties are committed to their values.\n\n8- Relatability is the doorway to friendships. One small relatable detail is the main ingredient in \u201cbonding.\u201d For instance, one person may love clothes and the other does as well\u2014they talk about brands and best places to shop and style. Otherwise they could be very different. However, they tend to avoid the differences once detected. This keeps them at a happy surface level of relating but never too deep.\n\nAs I\u2019ve aged I\u2019ve been very disappointed by how some friendships dissolved over time but I\u2019ve learned to see life in seasons and to allow change to happen, allow others to be themselves and not cling too hard.",

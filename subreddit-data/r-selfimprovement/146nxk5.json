    "postText": "Rejection. It can be scary and painful. Maybe humiliating. The fact you're putting yourself out there is admiral. \n\nWhen it comes to rejection what I do is embrace it. \n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nEmbrace being rejected. This is how you do it. Before you go out hype yourself pump yourself up. I went dt last weekend and before I left, I told myself I want to be rejected 5 times. That means I talked to 5 different guys. \n\nIf you do get rejected, remember it has nothing to do with you, you're not what they're looking 4. So let it go and try again. \n\nEvery rejection is a redirection.\n\nStay present and don't be too attached to the results\n\nTl,dr: embrace rejection. It means you opened you mouth and talked to more people. Rejection has nothing to do with you and you don't lost value. The person that rejected you is pointing you in a different direction\n\nGood luck, hopefully this can help as someone",

You have to think about factors in seduction: health concerns (including sexual), cultural differences, boundaries (including time, because people have jobs and stuff) and commitments etc.. That's why I think it's really not personal 98% of the time. The other 2% would be if she doesn't like you out of discrimination - which has happened to me before.",

BTW it's a service based business, no products. It can be done online but most prefer in person, which has been the biggest problem. The business had just started to pick up before covid hit but then crashed. It's never been the same since.",

I used my dad's auto garage. He had most of the equipment. Two years in, it wasn't growing. I had spent hundreds on materials and equipment, but didn't profit. I didn't particularly enjoy it. It's dirty ect but I had experience. I broke even minus my time. \n\nMy next business was giving guitar lessons. I'm not an amazing player, but competent. I had 15 years experience playing. About a year in, it wasn't growing past a few students. Partly due to being in a rural area. I decided to find greener pastures.\n\nMy business after that was working as a shade tree mechanic. I had tons of experience, and had been employed at several auto shops, and a shop that worked on transport trucks. I wasn't licensed but shops hired me to work as a mechanic under the guise of being an apprentice (zero oversight. Yeah super illegal lol).\nI did it mainly after work and on weekends (I was working as a mechanic during the day).\n\nI did that full time for two years. It was juuust enough to pay my bills. I kind of got tired of the direction the industry was heading in, and I decided I turned a passion into a job, and didn't love it anymore.\n\nI met my ex girlfriend (was current during these events) and I used some of that shade tree mechanic money to rent a garage. Nobody wanted to rent to a mechanic, so I started auto detailing.\n\nAfter a year I had put my competitor out of business by aggressively promoting and undercutting. I couldn't afford my apartment anymore and became what I call \"entrepen-homeless\". I moved into the tiny 6 ft x 12 foot room upstairs with my girlfriend and two large dogs. It sucked. Tiny room, big enough for a bed and a ghetto kitchen.\n\nAnyways by the time year 2 rolled around I was pulling $12k+ a month, and I never looked back. I'm 4 years in, still live in the shop, and still pull 10K a month.\n\nNow to address some of what you mentioned. My biz boomed before covid. Like a month before. When it hit I thought I was done for. Biz kept going strong.\n\nNow this year I notice a slump. I'm still busy. But I'm not booked out 2 months in advance. Instead booked out two weeks. I notice customers are more sensitive to price, and usually just want the inside done now (I was able to sell $100 exterior wash and waxes easily two years ago, this year I'm pitching the $40 wash and wax.\n\nI noticed the recessionary theme last fall, and downsized from 2 shops and 4 employees to myself in one shop and a part time helper. This cut my costs, boosted my margins, and allowed me to not raise prices (customers are feeling the crunch too).\n\nBasically right now Word of mouth has been keeping me going. I marketed aggressively on Facebook and Instagram (organic not paid) for the first two years. And haven't advertised at all for the last two. I haven't even posted to either social platform in that time. I've coasted off the momentum I had built.\n\nThat being said I'm insane and work 12+ hour days 6 days a week, and have pulled many 36 hour shifts as well.\n\nSorry for the novel. If you have any specific questions feel free to ask and I'll try to respond to it. But that's the story of how I made my first 100k+ a year. Been hitting that consistent for 3 years now. I reinvest much of my profit to make my job easier and make my shop more \"professional\"\n\nBasically I gave it a year or two. I wish I cut the cord sooner on the first few businesses .\n\nI've been able to afford an apartment for 3 years but still live in my shop. I expanded upstairs and now it's 15x15, and it's quite comfortable for one person and a dog",

I'm even as bold as to tell people playfully \"if you want to be able to get your car done next year please let your friends know I'm here, or i might not be\". I say it in a joking way, but I'm actually serious lol. \n\nLike my current business is flat rate on what I estimate the time is. Usually I can do two clients a day easily, and that's $500 minimum. Do that 6 days a week, and your doing 12k. \n\nAlso another tip. I burned myself out in my 2nd year pushing to make 200K. My best month ever was 18K, but I've never been so fking miserable in my life, so don't just chase big numbers. Keep some small semblance of work life balance. But also be prepared to skip alot of time wasting stuff people do, like socialize, party with friends or whatever. I was I ln 100% grind mode for 3 years. Year 4 I'm chilling doing closer to 50+ hours a week instead of like 80. But I'm much happier and it still keeps my pockets fat.\n\nI hope something was helpful here for you friend",

There is not a goal so small and easy that I can achieve twice without luck.",

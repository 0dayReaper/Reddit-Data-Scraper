    "postText": "I\u2019ve struggled my whole life with not being able to articulate myself well and it has become quite a big insecurity of mine. I\u2019m also not able to order my thoughts very well, there\u2019s always a million things going through my head at once. I\u2019m doing a lot of job interviews right now and it honestly just makes me feel stupid sometimes not being able to articulate and express myself well. Also another notable problem of mine, but this might be another problem not related to the other one, is that when I\u2019m asked a question that doesn\u2019t have an obvious answer and that I\u2019d have to think about, I just blank completely and won\u2019t be able to come up with anything. How would I go about improving this?\n\nSome of the reasons why I think I might have these problems: \n\n- I\u2019ve got AD(H)D\n- There\u2019s a big age gap between me and my siblings and I\u2019d always get interrupted when I\u2019d speak while having dinner, which made me feel insecure about speaking\n- I\u2019m pretty introverted (not shy), so I\u2019m by myself a lot, don\u2019t communicate much in my native tongue (which is the language of where I currently live) and all the content I consume (books, podcasts, music,\u2026) is in English.",

            "comment": "Read. Read a lot. (In the language you need to communicate in) Get a dictionary and search words you don't understand to expand your vocabulary, though often communication is best when simplified and everyone can understand. The goal is to string coherent sentences together fluently and not to sound like a pompous intellectual, but to understand the verbal diarrhoea they will spew to try to gain the upper hand in an argument.\n\nAlso, write a lot. Expressing yourself through writing is often easier than expressing yourself through speaking. It will help develop your thought processing.\n\nListen to podcasts where people have intellectual and thought provoking discussion. Learn the dynamics and etiquette of communication and conversation. Be patient and wait for the right moment to give your input and be assertive enough not to be spoken over once you start.\n\nMost importantly, engage in more deep conversation and debates. As an introvert, I understand this is a challenge in itself, but through engaging in conversation you'll naturally find your flow, and it will become second nature. Accept that we all get our tongues twisted at times and it's more about how quickly we can recover after that.",

So I think I\u2019ll have to switch to my native tongue for a little while then. I think writing my thoughts down might help me a lot as well since this should help me string my thoughts together.

    "postText": "The human mind has incredible capabilities, but sometimes we get stuck in one way of thinking or acting. To cultivate our mind, we can start by thinking about the world in a new way.  \n\n\nPutting ourselves in the role of lifelong learner and trying new experiences always has great positive results. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \"the mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions\". \n\nLet's learn to teach it new ways!  \n\n\n* Seek new challengesNew experiences always stimulate the mind. Try to incorporate small new experiences into your daily life.  \n\n* Read moreA book is a good way to learn about other people's experiences and thoughts.Not only do we learn from our own successes and mistakes, but also from others. Broaden your horizons.  \n\n* Practice emotional curiosityYour emotions shape your thoughts and your thoughts direct your actions.Learn to observe your emotions to anticipate your next steps.  \n\n* Expand your social circleOur lives are also the result of the people we surround ourselves with.Examine whether your social circle influences your life in the direction of your goals.Expand your circle, use it as a new challenge.  \nI would love to know what other practices you would add!",

As I get older, I find myself doing these things:  \n\n* Spending less time with people I'm not invested in\n* Worshipping sleep\n* Not doing shit that isn't me (and not apologizing!) \n\nHow about y'all? How have your priorities changed? \n\n*edit: also avoiding alcohol and coffee in excess bc it just makes me feel bad*",

Sobriety is a huge quality of life upgrade in many ways.\n\n-Focus more on taking care of myself and my health. If I don\u2019t then who will?\n\n-I\u2019m more argumentative and make my feelings known, but with the understanding that I may be wrong sometimes. But I take less crap and have less patience for nonsense from people.",

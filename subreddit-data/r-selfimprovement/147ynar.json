    "postText": "Hello all, I had a depressive meltdown during covid and my life sort of all went down the drain. I\u2019ve been making steps to get myself back on track but it\u2019s a challenge each day. \n\nA little background: pre covid I was doing great. I was working my way up in my career, had great friends with shared hobbies that I did everything with, a girlfriend that I was head over heels in love with, and a great sense of confidence in myself. When the pandemic hit my life sort of dominoed and one by one everything went straight to shit. I lost my job, my girlfriend dumped me and moved on almost immediately, I had to move back in with my crazy abusive parents who would not let me leave the house at all cause of the pandemic, and my friends slowly abandoned me one by one as I sank further into depression. Over time I kind of just got used to being alone. \n\nThis was the lowest point in my life, I had never been so miserable to be an unemployed depressed 29 year old living at home. Unable to leave the house due to a pandemic and abusive parents. Crying over a girl who moved on and forgot me instantly.\n\nHowever I did not let myself wallow the entire time. I studied my ass off and taught myself to code, built a portfolio and applied like crazy to every job I could. Finally after months of work I landed a dream job as an engineer at a big company making 6 figures. I moved out and this time got my own place in one of the nicest parts in all of California close to the beach. I\u2019ve been loving my job and new home and I am so grateful that the hard work is paying off. \n\nBut sadly I\u2019m still struggling socially. Especially since I learned recently that I have IBS which has been making me Miserable and hide in my apartment. Most of my friends still do not want to interact with me. Even when I make the effort to plan something everyone either bails or lies to me and they hang out without me. I confronted one of my friends about it and he pretty much point blank told me that no one really respects me anymore since i disappeared for 2 years and had a mental breakdown. I mean I get it, it\u2019s not like the friendship will be repaired over night but seeing them all doing things we used to together without me really sucks. No one really wants to chill with me anymore from my previous circle. I have like maybe one friend left and idk if that is even a real friend. I guess I\u2019m just stuck in this rut and I\u2019m not really sure how to get over this and start making new friends. \n\nI\u2019d really love to travel but I need to get my IBS under control and I guess get over my fear of traveling alone. I have hobbies like surfing but I find it hard to approach strangers lately. \n\nI\u2019d appreciate any advice, thanks for reading!",

            "comment": "Your friends sound like crappy people. Did you do anything to lash out and harm them? Or did you like perhaps repeatedly turn down invitations to hangout? Also- is your friend like the spokesperson for the group? How does he know that they don\u2019t all respect you? If so- they must be gossiping behind your back. Avoid these people cause they sound toxic, so you didn\u2019t really \u201close\u201d that much cause they weren\u2019t your real friends to begin with.",

Well, that person stood by you in difficult times. That's what I call a true friend. it seems to me that you just need to re-evaluate what is really important in life. Fun experiences, or faithful companions? Good luck.",

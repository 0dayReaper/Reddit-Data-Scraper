Because it is an intramuscular shot( will prolly get it in your deltoid), and muscles having fewer pain receptors than skin ( for subcutaneous injections); you won\u2019t even feel your covid shot. \nThe fear contributes the pain. Just like when someone sees you get hurt, it hurts more because emotions add to the pain through the reticular centre in your brain. I promise the pain of the shot is nothing compared to the body aches, fatigue and inflamed throat that this disease causes. Be thankful of modern medicine and take your jab. I promise more than helping others, you\u2019re helping yourself.\nCongratulations on overcoming the fear.",

I'm terribly afraid of vaccinations and blood sampling, but I just turn my head away and breathe deeply (sometimes, however, I faint, but that\u2019s ok) you\u2019re so brave! I\u2019m proud of you.

Also don't be afraid to ask to lay down for anything with needles. It helps. Lastly, just tell your medical professional you're scared. As weird as you think your situation has been they've seen worse. Lastly, shop for your medical care. If a facility or doctor doesn't provide the care you need , if possible, go somewhere else.

It was incredibly effective for me. I definitely had all my normal anxiety responses when i saw the needles, but once they were in i felt myself starting to relax. I did a few sessions and by the end i could even watch her put them in. \n\nI still have to be really careful with blood draws and lay down when they do it, but i can stop myself from passing out now.",

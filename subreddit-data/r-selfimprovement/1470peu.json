    "postText": "Sadly, it is because we are all addicted to dopamine, quick-hit sources of the happiness chemical such as social media and excessive snacking lead more and more of us into unhealthy lifestyles. There is only one way to fix this.\n\nA dopamine detox.\n\nA dopamine detox is a period of time when you go without any unhealthy sources of dopamine such as:\n\n* Addictive substances\n* Unhealthy foods\n* Social media\n* Television\n\nStarving yourself if these sources of dopamine lowers your base level of dopamine, meaning that you need less spikes of dopamine to become happy. This makes healthy exercise and foods very attractive as they are now a good source of dopamine. But how long should your dopamine detox last?\n\nI would say that 7 days is enough to start with, but doing more is obviously going to prove more effective than doing less. Repetition also keeps you engaged in your healthy lifestyle so I would recommend repeating a 7 day detox once a month.\n\nIf you practise this then getting in shape will be very easy, but it is hard. So don\u2019t be harsh on yourself if you fail the first time. Learn from your failure and try again, you\u2019ll achieve it with time.",

    "postText": "I feel like Sisyphus. Every time I begin to make progress I go back down again.  \nI've been working at an overnight full time job I love since March (my first time ever working full time so I guess that's progress) but I had a bad mental illness episode two nights in a row so they'll be switching me to daytime cuz theres no one to cover me at night. \n\nA few pieces of advice needed:\n\n\u2022In case my job doesnt work out anymore, how do I get a new one with a subpar job history?\n\n\u2022I got so far in uni and quit at the last moment (1 year before grad). I'd like to go back to community college as I never fully finished it before jumping to 4-year, how can I afford it?\n\n\u2022I gain weight bc of my medicine, how do I become fitter little by little instead of forcing it all on my body at once? Gym isnt an option rn\n\n\u2022Also, I don't have a drivers license because my parents never taught me. I currently live with my mom and she still doesnt wanna teach me. My friend offered to teach me but in case that falls thru do you know any cheap alternatives? (I live in FL)\n\nI have good hygiene and people I care about and hobbies and I like to go outside so at least that's good. \n\nMaybe just some advice on the pointers above would help? And yes I see doctors and such so at least there is that",

            "comment": "I\u2019ll answer what is easy for me to answer (because I don\u2019t live in America so I have no idea how to answer some of your questions).\n\nIn case your job doesn\u2019t work out anymore: you look for another one and you stay vague, saying things like \u00ab\u00a0some things didn\u2019t work out\u00a0\u00bb. I know people who lied their way to their job, so you should be fine just staying vague.\n\nFor the \u00ab\u00a0losing weight\u00a0\u00bb part, I would strongly advice you to do the following:\n\n1) start cooking by yourself. Look at r/cooking (for example) if you have questions. Cooking by yourself will ensure you know what\u2019s in your plate, and allow you to practice number 2 which is:\n\n2) measure calorie intake. There are plenty of ways to roughly measure your calorie daily needs (I like the Leangains method calculator). Then you put yourself in a low deficit, and intake only a bit less food than what your body needs. Only a bit though! Like a hundred, a few hundred calories at max. Some calculators will even give you the calorie intake you should aim at in order to lose weight. \n\nAs a side note, most of the job is now done. If you really want to go into it, you should even look at your intake sources (namely proteins, fiber, carbs and fats). Basically you will be hungry if you lower your calorie intake, so you replace some carbs with proteins and fibers (this will make the hunger go away without intaking too many calories). Do not completely ban carbs nor fats, these are 2 very bad ideas. Your body needs everything in order to function correctly.\n\n3) you can do some sport at home, even without any equipment! Try to make a complete program for the whole body out of 2-4 exercises (like 1 for the chest, 1 for the back, 1-2 for the legs). At your level, it\u2019s probably useless to focus too much on abs so I wouldn\u2019t recommend that. Try to get 15-30 minutes of sport every day. Look up YouTube videos to make sure your form is good, so you won\u2019t hurt your body.\n\nAlso be true to yourself: no medicine makes you gain weight. It might affect weight repartition or hunger, but if you don\u2019t eat, you don\u2019t gain weight. The intake is what makes you gain weight, so control that.",

The only one who can save me is myself. It\u2019s going to be a long journey but I will come back on top. I will find new friends and create my own chosen family. I will be successful financially and in my career. I will get the love I deserve and the family that I always wanted one day. \n\nI\u2019m fighting for myself to win. I\u2019m fighting to be happy again.",

First my wife of 12 years; the only woman I\u2019ve been with, told me she\u2019s leaving me a few days ago. She is also taking our two cats with her and I love them. I also pushed all my friends and family out of my life while being with her so I have no one. Word to the wise and whoever is reading this! Don\u2019t push friends and family out of your life for a relationship it will bite you in the ass one day. But yeah\u2026. I was suicidal and almost went through with it. But a miracle happened and now I\u2019m reading everyday, been working out everyday, eating healthy, talking to as many potential friends as I can\u2026 we can do this bro! We will survive and have what we deserve at the end of this! Keep hustling and remember to smile everyday and list off why you should be thankful every morning! We have a lot to be thankful for everyday just living in USA and having some freedom.",

This is a classical example of a partner not defending or standing up for the spouse /partner, and the partner imagines that this will continue without any problems. There\u2019s always 2 sides to a relationship. When someone starts blaming one party and tries to paint them as abuser I can very clearly state that this is a case of being in delusion. It\u2019s good that you are exploring and coming out of it, but don\u2019t say things that make you feel you are right and take away your responsibility in the situations that you co-created. You will never change and learn if you do so. Choice is yours. I have seen these discussions like a hundred times now and that\u2019s why I am suggesting this. The classic \u2018that person was my abuser\u2019. There is nothing like that. Your victim mentality originates from something from your childhood and she was just a trigger. Since you are now with your parents, it\u2019s time to dig into what they did to you to make you feel that way. It always comes back to childhood",

This is a classical example of a partner not defending or standing up for the spouse /partner, and the partner imagines that this will continue without any problems. There\u2019s always 2 sides to a relationship. When someone starts blaming one party and tries to paint them as abuser I can very clearly state that this is a case of being in delusion. It\u2019s good that you are exploring and coming out of it, but don\u2019t say things that make you feel you are right and take away your responsibility in the situations that you co-created. You will never change and learn if you do so. Choice is yours. I have seen these discussions like a hundred times now and that\u2019s why I am suggesting this. The classic \u2018that person was my abuser\u2019. There is nothing like that. Your victim mentality originates from something from your childhood and she was just a trigger. Since you are now with your parents, it\u2019s time to dig into what they did to you to make you feel that way. It always comes back to childhood",

Although, we had already stopped talking about our daily, tiny things some months ago but we were still friends as before.

She told that she has been trying to solve her issues alone as no one would actually understand the concerns of others.

My friends, family, home, beloved pets and everything I had been working for in my life. I was entirely on my own having to figure out how to navigate homelessness, an emotional crisis triggered by yet another sa and being all alone for the first time without the codependent relationship of my mom. It was terrifying and liberating. It forced me to put all of what I had to give into my survival and rebuilding of my life. I was challenged in ways that pushed past limits I never imaged I'd be forced to push past. I had to advocate for myself and find the voice thatd always been robbed of me in regards to how I managed my mental health and how I was going to dictate my road to recovery. It was hard and I would not change a thing. I proved to my self that I can take care of myself. I can advocate for myself. I can speak for myself. I don't need to rely on my mom or depend on friends who were never there for me anyway. It was uncomfortable at times, it was scary and unsafe. But I showed myself what I'm capable of and I'll never doubt myself again.\n\nAnd I rebuilt my life into something better than I could have imagined before I tore it all down.

    "postText": "I've been doing better than the last time I posted here. I have paid off my debt finally and I have a job that I'm pretty ok with.\n\nBut now even after being in this job for 5 months, I feel pretty lonely. I don't have any friends there because people already have others who they hangout with and it feels like no group has space for me. Maybe because their initial impression of me was a drug addict depressed guy. I have been clean since 3 months now and I'm much better now. I feel lonely all the time at work even between so many people. It's a small startup so there are 22 other people besides me. And then there's a couple and I feel bad looking at them because my gf lives in a different state and we don't get to meet like this everyday. I hate myself for feeling like this.\nEven during breaks I'm the one who's always alone and even in life I got no friends whom I can see and enjoy with. All of them are busy with work. I try catching up but people get busy after growing up. I feel lonely all the time and feel like getting high again to not feel this bad.\n\nRant over\n\nI have also started working out since a month but yea it's very slow progress.",

You have a much better relationship with yourself as a result of blocking out everyone you see on social media. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s that necessary to completely put a halt on your social life tho. Make sure to still stick around your close friends through text messages or real life. \nAs a piece of advice, if you are struggling to not use social media at first, try to become a lot more invested into your other hobbies that you enjoy",

            "comment": "Getting rid of social media is not what I would have thought of when reading the expression \"disappear for a year\". And the obvious question is: Why would you want to go back to social media again after that year? What's the point?\n\nSocial media is nothing but a waste of time. So what would you gain? Everything else. You would stop wasting your time on pointless bullshit, on people who are doing whatever they can to try and get your attention. You would eliminate a major source of negativity in your life. Would stop comparing yourself to others all the time because you would no longer be spending most of your time looking at other people and what they do. Instead you could use all that time and energy you've gained to pursue things actively in your own life. Instead of following some fitness guys on social media, you can work out yourself and become like them. Again, ideally without trying to compare yourself to them since that only breeds insecurity.\n\nThe way you've phrased your post it sounds like you're finding a life without social media hard to imagine. As if you would actually \"disappear\" from the face of the earth. When in reality nothing would change aside from that you'd get more time to spend on more useful and meaningful things. There's nothing more meaningless than social media. But you probably can't see that until you've actually spent some time without and learned to enjoy some other things that life has to offer.\n\nAlso avoiding social media should only make you more social, not less. You're not being social if you're constantly glued to your phone. You are on the contrary ignoring the people around you. That is what everyone does nowadays and not just because of social media, but some folks can never stop listening to music, no matter where they are. So they are always in their own world, reacting to things around them but never really paying attention. Learn to pay attention. That way you'll start caring about things. Things that don't provide you with some instant gratification like all the crap that everyone is so addicted to nowadays. And then everything else becomes a lot more enjoyable and no one thing will matter as much as it probably does now.",

And online forums used to be mainly a source of information. But I guess with reddit's cancerous upvote system and how they get rid of all posts after a few days at most, you can treat it as social media now: Superficial, only meant as a distraction, a place for people to post random shit and opinions. And of course for attacking others. The latter's what a lot of people seem to mainly use reddit for. Though many seem to stick only to downvoting anything they don't like.",

Otherwise spend time outside with people. You can have more meaningful interactions in the real world from person to person. Social media or messaging apps people mainly use to waste time and as such things there tend to be very superficial.\n\nFocus on yourself and on discovering your interests. Find some sport to play or learn any new skills. Find enjoyment in activities like that. Then you should lose the desire over time to hang around and chitchat. The more interests you have, the deeper the interactions you'll be able to have with people. Though that mainly depends on who you're interacting with. If most people you usually spend time with are very superficial, then you might lose interest in interacting with them as you spend more time on more meaningful things. Especially if you get into self development and start learning all kinds of things. That will change you. So you might have to seek out new people that are more similar to you.\n\nBut it always comes down to what you spend your time on, not on what you're trying to get rid of. If you want to elliminate something from your life think first about what you're going to replace it with. It should always be about what you're trying to make time for, not about what to get rid of. Because trying to remove a bad habit without finding a better replacement will only leave a hole in your life that needs to be filled somehow. And if you don't actively find a better replacement, then you're likely to just spend more time on other bad habits instead.",

(The others are financial, physical, spiritual, family, personal development, and career for whatever that's worth.)  Spending time with my friends does not take me away from my goals.  Spending time with my friends is a *vital part* of my goals.\n\nShould you spend *less time* with your friends?  Maybe.  Are some of the people you're hanging around people you shouldn't be hanging around with anymore?  Maybe.  Are there activities they're doing you shouldn't do anymore?  Maybe.  That doesn't mean you should disappear though.",

It give the annotation that your gonna disappear and come back to what,the people who don\u2019t like you all of a sudden likes you,the people who disrespected you are gonna respect you now. Or whatever the outcome your thinking of by \u201cdisappearing\u201d won\u2019t change nothing around you. And to piggy back what I said already. Do it for YOURSELF. Find the error in the situations you slipped up on,Reflect your behaviors and responses,Do a lot of inner work. And one of man\u2019s greatest currencies is our health. And when I say health there\u2019s more than just your \u201cdiet\u201d or whatever. It\u2019s Mental,Physical, and Spiritual/Emotional. Really if you take care of those things within your day to day,you\u2019re on to a better route already.

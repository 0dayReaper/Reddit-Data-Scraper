    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am a 28-year-old male currently attending in university.  I enrolled late in one of the top universities here, Seoul National University, majoring in Business Administration, with a GPA of 3.3/4.0. I have internship experience at BCG and Bain\u2019s Seoul offices and am preparing for a strategic consulting career. If accepted, I will have 6 months to a year before I start.\nEven if I fail and get a job elsewhere, I think I'll have about 6 months.\n\nHowever, after struggling with mathematics throughout my 20s, I have developed an interest in data analysis and statistics. I feel that the future lies more in mathematics and engineering rather than business administration, especially considering my long-term goal of starting my own business. Therefore, I plan to dedicate the next six months to improving my ranking on Kaggle as much as possible.\n\nBut the questions lingering on my mind are:\n\n\t1.\tIs it realistic to venture into mathematics at 28? Can someone like me, who failed in mathematics in his 20s, make a successful comeback now?\n\t2.\tIs 28 too late? (For reference, I am considered 30 in Korean age.)\n\t3.\tIf possible, I would like to move to the United States or the United Kingdom in 3 to 5 years. By then, I would have about 3 years of professional experience. How competitive would I be in such circumstances?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice or insights you can offer. Thank you.",

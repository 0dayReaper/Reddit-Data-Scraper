    "postText": "This journey never ends. To start, we (29M &amp; 29F) were only together for a little over 6 months. She was a great girl, one of the best I\u2019ve had. However I found myself pouring most of my energy into our relationship while my personal life and goals fell to the wayside. I feel terrible for breaking her heart, but deep down I know that this was the best thing for me. A factory reset if you will. I\u2019ll take a few days to recover from the break up and get back to the grind. Cleaning my home and vehicle daily, getting to bed at a decent time, waking up early, putting in long hours at work and making time for physical fitness. Sometimes the right thing feels wrong and the wrong thing feels right. Gotta step back and take a look at the bigger picture. Hope everybody is having a productive Friday.",

It is a fear of commitment/form of self sabotage.\n\nI had an AMAZING woman in my life. I was actually a terrible boyfriend to her but all she wanted was to build a life with me. I continued to make up excuses in my head that I wouldn\u2019t be able to live the life I wanted with her, I had to be in a better financial position etc etc. The truth was, I am naturally someone who does just enough to get by while she was a go getter! She would\u2019ve helped me accomplish ALL my goals in life if I would have simply understood that PARTNERSHIP is the key to long term individual happiness in this life. No one can be an island. For any one reading let me be a cautionary tale. If you have a great partner, appreciate them and never leave them due to worrying you won\u2019t be able to achieve your dreams. Because once they leave your life, you\u2019ll tell yourself \u2018my dreams were NEVER as important as you, I wish I had proved that to you\u2019.\n\nBest to all",

Like, there were periods of time when I was in a long-term relationship that in hindsight, was probably the right time for me to be single and focus on my goals/school (late teens - early 20s). And it has nothing to do with whether my ex was a great person or not. It's just that it was the right time for me to figure out who I am as a person and work on myself.\n\nOr, for example, I had this chem lab partner at school last semester who was failing all his classes because he was nonstop simping over his girlfriend. Ironically, he was telling me how his gf was fighting with him because he was distracting her from school. Clearly, it's not the right time for him to be pouring all this energy into a relationship that is toxic AF.\n\nIf OP wants to focus on his career at the moment (so that he could be a competent person / husband / father in the future) and his girl just wants to get married, have kids, etc and their goals just simply don't align at the same time... then, he's doing the right thing because he can't give his girl what she wants.\n\nAnd if marriage is what she wants, then it's better to break it off sooner rather than later so she gets a chance to meet someone who is at the same stage in life as her and wants the same things she wants.\n\nBut we only know what OP is sharing in this post and it's not a lot of info.",

As long as they recognize that, and genuinely stay away from their ex rather than yoyo-ing her back and forth when either end of the spectrum gets to be too much, then this is the best that OP can actually do until he works on himself to his satisfaction.\n\nEventually he will accept and work on that part of himself, while still feeling in control of the rest of his life.

I do however understand that it's important to pay attention to how you feel as time goes on. If it doesn't feel right, and you want to focus on yourself, then do it. I know I had to take a step back when I realized that I put all my efforts and energy into a relationship and all other things feel by the wayside (to a fault). Life requires balance and finding the right person will take time, and the right person won't feel right if you don't have your own shit together. There's no right or wrong way to live life, but keep making those decisions that continue to bring you happiness. Maybe you and this girl can make it work once you are ready to maintain your own life in a way you feel is right.",

While I dated her and loved her, I became incredibly comfortable. Got out of shape, didn\u2019t see friends nearly as much, wouldn\u2019t do social things with friends as much. But now I\u2019m getting to the point where I know whoever I end up with that I\u2019ll have the boundaries set initially for what I need to do for myself and health as well as being a great partner who is present and gives effort, support, and energy. \n\n\nTake some time to really think about how you can balance what you want while also being able to give your next partner what they need.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m going to be honest, as someone who was perceiving things the same way in good relationships.\n\nAll these comments saying relationships take effort are correct, but it seems like your main issue is that you felt like the other areas of your life were being neglected due to how much effort and time you spent on the relationship.\n\nWas this something you imposed on yourself? Did the maintaining of the relationship really require you to neglect the other areas of your life? Did your partner really demand/need that from you? Or is this something your subconscious told you you needed to do in order to keep the relationship afloat? Did you assume that the relationship would deteriorate if you continued to be your own person while in it? Was that assumption fair to your partner, who you may have not even given the chance to show you who they were and how they could contribute to the relationship, and how content they might have been in it regardless of you paying full attention to other areas of your life and being a whole person?\n\nJust something to think about. Most of the issues we come up with when it comes to interpersonal relationships have something to do with projections or assumptions we don\u2019t even realize we\u2019re making. We bring ideas of what we *must* do or how our relationships *must* look as a default, and leave little room for just how broad and wide experiences and life can be if we just allow it.",

You leave a supposedly good girl \"one of the best you've ever had\". So you can focus on your personal goals and the big picture? The big picture for most men is setting themselves up with a nice career that has room for promotions and growth. So that they can get married and have a family. This is the biggest addition most of us will make to this world. For most of us, especially as men, it's the only legacy we have. Most of us won't get the opportunities or work hard enough to become Fortune 500 CEOs, superstar athletes, hotshot lawyers, neurosurgeons, or business tycoons. So in essence having a woman by our side is always the big picture. So why would you leave \"one of the best you've ever had\" after only 6 months? You haven't had enough time to lose yourself in her. At that point, it's still rainbows and roses. Which to me says one main thing. You want to blame your lack of discipline on an innocent girl. Hoping not expecting,  that leaving her is enough of a push to maybe get back to things you probably weren't doing anyway. I mean \"clean my car\"? That's even something you had to mention? She soaks up so much of your time that your car is always dirty? Make it make sense dude. Your relationship with her isn't the reason your other areas of life aren't getting enough attention. Funny enough women find men who stay on their purpose more attractive. So if you were in yours she'd value the little time you gave her even more. And brag about you to all her friends. There is a reason women still continue to choose men who don't make time for them. The allure of that type if man is more exciting. You clearly don't have enough accountability to manage yourself. Good riddance that you chose to leave. At least now she can get someone who will not leave her for some flimsy reason.",

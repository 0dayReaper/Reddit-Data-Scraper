    "postText": "I quit my 1st big girl job 2 months ago &amp; currently searching for another one. It\u2019s been hard, but it certainly doesn\u2018t make it easier when my mother is around. She\u2019s upset about me quitting &amp; she\u2018s now getting frustrated with my slow, or lack of, progression.\n\nActually, she knew I would fail at my work due to my tendency of making &amp; repeating mistakes (which prompted me to quit, &amp; it was by her advice). I now began to accept the realization that I\u2019m mistake prone &amp; repeat offender of it &amp; looking into the possibility that I might have ADHD. Either way, my mom says no workplace will want to hire me because my mistakes will be on record like a police record &amp; being neurodivergent. I also halfass at everything &amp; she told me harshly to put my mind into it, avoid distraction, &amp; make effort into everything.\n\nTo me, even that is too much, but she said it\u2019s only harder if you make it. My mom is the most proper, poised, perfect adult in the world that loves to work beyond her limits, have control over everything, &amp; loves to follow society\u2019s rules. She doesn\u2019t really have a passion, but will make it up by putting effort. Even if she doesn\u2018t have a passion, she claims she could a doctor, dental assistant, or author by effort. In her mind, you don\u2019t need to have a passion, you just need to give it your all.\n\nI talked to a friend &amp; he told me that life can be unfair when you try, but if you give up, it\u2019ll bury you. He also said there\u2019s a limit into giving it your all, but you would still need to try &amp; if it doesn\u2019t work, try a different way &amp; adjust your mindset.\n\nIs my mom right? Is life really about giving it your all? Or just let it flow?",

You are a human being with a consciousness and free will, use it as much as you can because only machines are made to live by someone else's rules.\n\n\nEDIT:\nthis is everyone's first time living, none of us know what we are doing, that's kinda just how it be sometimes",

And don\u2019t try to argue with her as she\u2019s very adamant.\n\nIt\u2018s hard to be a grown woman who had weedfuls of childhood trauma &amp; suspected CPTSD &amp; ADHD. To her, my rape should be the only disability. Everything else is \u2018in my head\u2018. Even thinking, communicating, &amp; micromanaging is too much for me. \n\nBecause of what I went through, I deserve better &amp; expect it to come to me without any effort. I was waiting to some divine magic to come &amp; do a complete life overhaul. That\u2018s why I am the way I am now",

    "postText": "So many years of self hate. The feeling like my life had to be specific to whatever my father wanted, since all I wanted was his approval. \n\nBut...he crossed a line when he neglected to care for my dog, heck the family dog, after I had moved out. \n\nAfter that it's like I snapped and everything for into place. I'm very Intune now with my emotions, I'm starting to understand my trauma and how it was caused, I'm embracing my own choice of religion that I had left.\n\nIt kills me that I lost my best friend, yet through him I've gained strength, courage, and dedication. \n\nFor the first time in my entire life (20 years) I finally feel at peace and ready to live my life the way I want too!",

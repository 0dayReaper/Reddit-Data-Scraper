    "postText": "Hello redditors,\n\nI don't know if I am in the right sub, but I don't know what to do. I am a daily weed smoker although I generally smoke only half a joint before going to bed. Yesterday I smoked and went to bed to prepare myself to sleep. As I was mentally preparing to sleep I suddenly hear my own voice saying ''what are you doing?'' and ''stupid B\\*\\*\\*\\*!'' and other random short sentences that I don't remember over and over again and all at the same time. I don't know if it was truly my voice or was my voice making weird and random impressions (sometimes when I think to myself I change my inner monologue voice making it deeper or high pitch, don't know if it is normal to do that either.) I don't know if it was random voices or truly my own. I've never felt so much stress and anxiety this intense in my life I think. I was thinking of going to the hospital but convinced myself it must be my inner monologue being out of control and scrolled on reddit to tire my brain and finally slept off.\n\nToday I feel okay, I am still a bit anxious from yesterday but I don't hear any voice or my inner monologue going crazy. However, I will be taking a long break from smoking to see if this situation is going to happen again even when I don't smoke. \n\nI don't know what to think so I am asking your opinion if you have ever experienced something like this, any advice?",

I smoked for nearly 10 years, and ever since I stopped my anxiety has been much better\u2026Not saying you need to stop, but for me (struggle with tons of anxiety on a regular-basis) smoking only amplified anxiety for me. \n\nMaybe try cutting down on it, try exercising more and doing stuff to keep busy while sober. Eventually, go cold turkey for 30 days and see if you feel better :)",

Drug induced psychosis is no joke, schizophrenia is even less of a joke. And regularly smoking it also increases the chances for depression, anxiety and a ton of other psychological and even neurological disorders. It can also decrease IQ. Tldr it does damage, even tho it had been known for being a pretty harmless drug for a long time. Now we have studies showing that it defu isn't. It doesn't fuck up your organs to much (except for the lungs if course if you smoke it,  or makes you that physically dependent, BUT it's not good for your brain and psyche at all. Especially regular and early consumption. I'm not against trying it in your 20s and maybe smoking once a year or whatever, but you definitely shouldn't do it regularly. And especially when you notice unpleasant psychological symptoms like paranoia or even psychotic symptoms,, you should stop! And if it doesn't stop within the next few days you need to get yourself looked at by a mental health professional ASAP.",

Make sure ur sleep cycle is healthy and it shouldn\u2019t bother you too often i think.

            "comment": "Well you don\u2019t say your height or gender, so I\u2019m going to give you very basic advice.\n\nGet on the 5/3/1 program by Jim Weeder if you want to get big, and drink a gallon of milk a day. Whole milk. To gain muscle you need both exercise and enough calories and protein to gain muscle (you need 50g of protein a day to maintain your current body mass, you\u2019ll need more to grow).\n\nMost people at the gym are super nice, if anyone\u2019s ever mean to you or make fun of you, tell the front desk. That\u2019s the second fastest way to be banned from the gym and the fastest involves not having your pants on in pubic spaces.\n\nAt your weight and age I wouldn\u2019t train cardio, you need cardio with some resistance- find a few little old ladies in your neighborhood and mow their yards and shovel their walks. That will both get you the workouts you need, and help you develop other stuff that you won\u2019t notice till your older but is good and will help you a lot later in life.\n\nIf your gym includes a season with a personal trainer to help you learn the moves, go for it. If not, ask politely if someone can give you pointers if they have time- again gym people are incredibly nice, and the most ripped Rock looking guy was once a newbie and they will help you out if they have the time.watch a lot of YouTube videos about good form and how to life well, bad habits with small weights now leads to bad form with bigger weights and serious injuries later.\n\nA squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, and you\u2019re going to be set to add a lot of muscle to your frame. As you progress, look into Brent Contreras\u2019s glute workouts on YouTube- adding a hip thrust will develop your glutes and with strong glutes you get a great butt as well as protecting your lower back from pain and making moving a lot easier in general.",

You might also want to go to some other weightlifting subs but my favorite is a silly one, r/swoleacceptance \n\nAnd if anyone ever says they\u2019re an \u201calpha\u201d stop listening to them.\n\nPm me if you ever need any help. It\u2019s going to be really hard for you to eat as much as you\u2019ll need at first and if you get sick of the milk get some protein powder and toss it in for another flavor. Or look at a 75 oz steak and resize that\u2019s how much protein you\u2019ll need to be slamming down every day (eggs are cheap, be like Gaston and eat eggs every morning). \n\nWhen you start building muscle the other things that might trip you up is you will NEED more sleep- the body heals something like 7x faster when you\u2019re sleeping and building muscles is the same as healing. So make sure you hit the sack earlier.\n\nTake some progress pictures and have fun! In a couple years you won\u2019t recognize your old self.",

Find workout splits on YouTube, I personally do push/pull/shoulders/legs. You\u2019ll find what exact workouts work for you. But the main compounds like bench squat shoulder press deadlift pull-ups are staple.\n\nSomeone said two days of rest between workouts, good luck seeing gains with that. You\u2019ll see something, after a year, I guess. But it\u2019ll likely be miniscule unless your hitting it like you\u2019re Ronnie Coleman.\n\nAll this is what\u2019s worked for me, and what I\u2019ve seen work for others from personal experience having started lifting at 16.\n\n\u201cOvertraining\u201d is 99% of the time bullshit",

The biggest issues for underweight guys getting started tend to be on putting on the first round of mass and a 3x a week split should be more than enough to help him put on muscle while giving him enough time to recover, especially with newbie gains.\n\nI train for strength endurance so I hit it hard 6x a week but I\u2019ve been at it for a really long time and I have fast healing/muscle gain genetics. \n\nI think it\u2019s better for newbies to start at 3x a week and go more if they love it or once they get a baseline of bulk and skill. It\u2019d be hard for any newbie to lift with good form when they\u2019re still tired from yesterday and since everyone\u2019s experience with DOMS is different (delayed onset muscle soreness), setting the expectation that a 6x a week training schedule right off the bat is needed, might lead to an injury or keeping him out of the gym long term.\n\nAlso Ronnie Coleman is not everyone\u2019s goal. He\u2019s got an incomparable physique but he had to drop out of the game from injuries, and you can still be strong, big, and muscular waaaaasaaay before you hit Ronnie Coleman\u2019s body. Shit I think even at his peak Arnold wasn\u2019t as big as Ronnie. \n\nThat\u2019s like trying to sing the solo for the Queen of the Night aria at your first singing lesson or perform brain surgery your first day of college- let the kid get to med school first \ud83d\ude05\n\nThat said I do high volume KB swings or an hour of s/e training a day with joint mobility and stretching drills, as well as glutes 3-6 times a week- I can happily spend two hours a day at the gym but it\u2019s absolutely not for everyone. I\u2019d still tell a newbie to do something like Turkish get ups and KB swings for 45 min a day max and those are full body exercises, no one muscle group gets hammered, and even then a good coach while leaning so you don\u2019t get injured would be important.\n\nWe gotta give the baby gym bros a taste of success.",

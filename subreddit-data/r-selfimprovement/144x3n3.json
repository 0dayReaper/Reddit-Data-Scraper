    "postText": "Hi everyone, I'm turning 30 this year. Have a well paying job, loving family, exercise regularly, and am an all round well adjusted human being.\n\nRecently felt increasingly very stuck in life. Its been an ongoing feeling for a fear years now but it has been exacerbated by some large life events in the past year. E.g. death of grandparent who was close to me, event at work that made me reconsider if I truly wanted to hustle, parents growing older, a friend who said she'd never settle down but who suddenly fell pregnant, got married in a shotgun, and is now happily and steadily raising her little boy.\n\nWhat are some things you have done to get out of your rut? Or books to read?",

The best book I\u2019ve read on this is called \u201cit\u2019s easier than you think,\u201d by Sylvia Boorstein. It\u2019s an easy read and won\u2019t take more than a couple days.  I highly recommend taking some time to read it.",

    "postText": "I(f/28) have a problem with making deep relationships with people, friends /and romantic partners. I didn't pay attention to it at all, until I saw myself avoiding someone who wants me while I keep searching and wanting some other guy who lives far away, or even before, I liked guy who has gf (and I even told him that, so I needed to stop seeing him). I always fall for smth what is impossible and which I know deep inside of me that it will not work.?!! \n\nIt's like I'm choosing smth what is bad for me? Its not normal. And I don't know why I'm choosing that, why I choose to be sadly in love with someone I know I can't have and it's impossible to happen?\n\n\n The problem is, I'm aware of it, I avoid any intimacy, and I wanted to fix it by going to gym, by looking better. And when I achieve my weight goal, I find another problem, as skin related, acne, hair... I know Ill never be perfect, but I rly can't stand looking bad, but in same time  it's impossible for me to fix it, to fix everything. Other ppl r happy in relationships and they r not perfect why am I demanding that from myself? Is it another form of self-sabotage? \n\nAnddd I rly can't be forever alone. I had partners(a few) , but I was with them when I got a little drunk. I can't be intimate with anyone if I'm not a bit drunk, so I can relax and not worry.? \nBeside that, I was never open to my ex bf. Like, I never show my vulnerable side, I don't show them my feelings. Everything is on surface, everything is fine... Also my relationships were not long..\n\n\nOn the other side I'm great friend, I'm outgoing person, everyone want to hang out with me (more or less), I can find ppl who r more like me and with who I can easily connect on some lvl, I can have fun. I want to say that I'm not some newbie in social life... I'm not shy nor boring. \nBuuuut, but no deep conversation, no deep meaningful relationships. \n\nHow can I fix it? I rly crave for good relations, I crave for support but also I can't rly relay on guys. I have few male friends and I know I can count on them(but even if they don't help it's OK, I can deal with it on my own) , but as partners it's rly hard for me to trust them. \n\nHow to overcome that fear and how to feel more pretty? Why I like to be unhappily in love with someone who can't return it to me? Do I deeply think I'm not worth of loving at all? \n\nPls, can u give me any advice cuz I tried every singe thing. I know that everything is in my head but I rly can't relax, I worry all the time, I saw that they don't have good intentions, I'm afraid they will hurt me. I didn't choose good in past and I fear Im incapable of choosing Wright person in present. It's always emotionaly unavailable partner. \n\nThank you.",

Nobody is afraid of the free voucher at the casino, except if they have a gambling problem and use it like ITS NOT a bonus.",

I'm paranoid even, I see red flags everywhere and I'm questioning myself is it real or is it from past experiences and I end up not believing my judgment at all! - so result is that I give up of further interaction with that person... \n\nI hope u understand what I'm trying to say. I observe every situation and how guy behave and in the end my conclusion is he is not for me, he is narcissistic or he likes control or he doesn't respect my boundaries... Etc. It's always smth so maybe I'm scared and I try to find a reason to stay away from relationship (subconsciously) . Maybe I see those red flags from past experience orrrr I just rly attract those kind of ppl in my life for some reason. And idk how to change it. \n\n\nOfc everything can be bonus but also in the same time it can be harmful and I think (even after 9 months of solitude) I can't bare it. On the other hand I should have healed after almost a year but its not happening.:/ And I'm afraid of its impossible to heal and to change my thoughts. It's rly confusing. It's like I can't trust my own judgment cuz I failed so many times in the past.",

We can't dissmis it. I hate when ppl say u need to love being alone or to be happy with ur own company. I am. I am happy and I like being alone, I had my hobbies, activities I like to do by myself with nooone involved. \n\nBut it doesn't change the fact that I miss a lot of great stuff which I wasn't able to experience in my lifetime... \n\nI want some good experience for a change, and I'm afraid cuz of my fear ill miss some good opportunities in the future as well.  It's rly complicated, maybe I should seek out the therapist.",

So if they're the wrong stories, that's self-doubt.\n\nThat should tell you everything about learning about yourself-- whereas: you manifest yourself.\n\nYou don't need to learn about yourself, that's available all the time through demonstration, not just in relationships.\n\nEven so, just because you can demonstrate the idea of yourself doesn't automagically make it a good idea at all. Nor a bad idea. I think it just is.\n\nI think you're making excuses to be in a relationship. What do I care? \n\nI think you're trying to convince yourself.\n\nYou're talking about missing out but it comes with all the pain and hardship for people that are uneducated and incapable to step up.",

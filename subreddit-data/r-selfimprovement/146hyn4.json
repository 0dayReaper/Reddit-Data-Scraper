    "postText": "I didn\u2019t grow up with motivation or people let alone my cousins liking me because I wasn\u2019t the best looking growing up. So after getting attention from people mostly a guy I\u2019m talking to it just makes me feel like I shouldn\u2019t have this. He called me out and told me why I always put myself down I didn\u2019t realize how it came off. He\u2019s very smart and just generally a very good person and I just like teasing him of how great he is. I don\u2019t like him complementing me let alone others so I brush it off or just make a tiny joke from it here and there. I do it without releasing until he said something about it. Now I\u2019m crying. I don\u2019t mean to be like that and it just upsets me. It just feels strange when people like me. I have people just trying to be my friend but a part of me just wonders why. Should I seek medical help?? I just feel bad. I know this is weird but i just want it to stop. Is this bad enough to seek help or am I over exaggerating? Please anything direct or simple is enough. Thank you!!",

Sit with how she clarifies what exactly self-deprecating humor is. Embrace the struggle. It's heavy shit. Please come out a better person.",

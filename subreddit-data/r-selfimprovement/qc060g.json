Once you realise this and know the true reasons, they become a lot easier to overcome",

There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. \n\n  And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.\u201d \n\n  Marianne Williamson",

            "comment": "Oh the horror of hesitation!\n\nI believe there's a difference between procrastination and hesitation. \n\nProcrastination is purposeful, waiting for the right time to do something, thoughtfully, rationally. You're always putting off *something*, even if you choose to do the productive thing. You procrastinate one thing til later in order to do something right now. \n\nProcrastination is really the heart of time management. Knowing what you should be putting off til later will make you more productive than trying to do everything all at once. Procrastinating is prioritizing, basically.\n\nHesitation, on the other hand, is sporadic, fueled by anxiety. All emotional decision making. You want to move forward, but you're frozen in fear. You stop yourself, not because it's the logical thing to do, nor because you're waiting for the right opportunity, but because you're stifled by the negative feelings associated with the potential consequences of performing the task or goal at hand. Perhaps that consequence is failure, perhaps it's rejection. Whatever the case may be, it's not laziness holding you back. It's pure and utter fear of said consequence.\n\nLaziness is good in balance. It's good to give yourself leisure and stay cool, calm, and laid back. It's good to value your own time and effort - to make the things you do actually *worth* the effort, as a lazy person tends to do. After all, if you're gonna actually get out of bed, it might as be a worthwhile endeavor.\n\nAnd you gotta look at why you want to stay in bed. Is it because you just want to genuinely relax? Or is it because you want to try and hide from potential consequences?\n\nIf it's the latter, then you are indeed hesitating and need to stop spooking yourself so silly.\n\nIt's all in your head, man. Besides, failure isn't the end, it's just part of the learning process.\n\nLike a lazy little sloth, climb that tree to the heights of your goal, ever steady and ever slowly.",

I have not seen a therapist and there is trauma in that but above everything, it is fear. I know I can get things under control if I get diagnosed for suspected mental ailments I have and possibly get medicated, but it's terrifying. I am a contradicting person tho too lol I like to say I'm the bravest pussy I know. Don't turn the lights off at home, I'm scared of the dark, but let me go tent camping in the desert 7 hours from my home, alone, with no cell service lol (just did this). I feel like it's a great example for explaining how I contradict myself.\n\nThanks for the reality check, I need it sometimes, even if I still let the fear prevent me from moving forward.....",

Now instead of a sexual fantasy, you think and feel depressive, lonely thoughts all day, well biologically you are still the same person as the day 1 lazy version of yourself. Your body is so conditioned that even when the mind wants to get up, work out, etc, the body is so conditioned to be lazy that the body Now is the mind .\n\nTo get over this, I'd suggest looking into living a quantum reality rather then a newtonian reality where the former creates events where as the latter waits for a cause to feel an effect.",

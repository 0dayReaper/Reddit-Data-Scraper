    "postText": "G'day guys,\n\nAs the title suggests I'm going through a period of self reflection right now and I'm not exactly happy with what I'm seeing. Don't get me wrong I'm not depressed or anything, just disappointed that I'm further away than I thought from being the person I want to be.\n\nThe trigger for this self reflection is two fold, first was a a high performance effort at my workplace that led to a poor outcome and left me spent afterwards, the second being a casual relationship with a slight attachment coming to an end quite suddenly when she told me she was still in love with her ex (for the record I ended it as we didn't want things to be messy and we remain very good friends).\n\nThese events took place within the same week and despite neither affecting me too much at the time individually the two together made me self concious. Now don't get me wrong, there were things about myself I was already looking at improving prior to this, but this acted as an extra gut punch.\n\nNow as my reflections are mounting and I'm realising the amount of work infrastructure of me to get back to a happy place the decision paralysis of where to start is very real. This is so bizarre for me as I've never been one to struggle with decisions/choices, simply doing what makes me happy.\n\nThrough my work I've engaged a psychologist to help me in the journey and I will be seeking other aids to improve/accelerate my gains. The struggle overall at the moment is knowing now where I'm at, being unhappy in general and knowing the path out is slow. Self sabotage out of comfort is also a very real fear.\n\nI don't know what motivated me to create this account and seek this community out to share. But I think manifesting this post makes the reality honest to my self, and I hope will allow me to compartmentalise the negative emotions associated with what I'm doing in order to continue pushing forward.\n\nHowever if anyone has any advice on avoiding circular negative thoughts without using a favourite hobby as a distraction and turning that hobby negative too I'm all ears.",

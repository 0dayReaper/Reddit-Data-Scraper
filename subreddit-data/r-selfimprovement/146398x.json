            "comment": "It is challenging, but it's also a huge opportunity if you pursue it. Exposing ourselves to new places, new people, new ideas is what opens doors for us. There's things we don't know we like, knowledge that could help us if we find it, best friends we haven't met yet. Many people stay in their comfort zones too much and while it might be comfortable it's not where growth happens. There will be a learning curve in this new place, but the ability to meet new people and figure things out on your own is extremely valuable in and of itself. You can use that in other places, it will give you confidence in every room of strangers you enter for the rest of your life, and it will make you a more interesting person to all those you meet down the road. I have never met someone who regretted taking an opportunity like this (although some regretted not making the most of it while they were abroad, so carpe diem as much as you can). \n\nCongratulations on this opportunity, and I wish you all the best!",

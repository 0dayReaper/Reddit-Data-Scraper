    "postText": "This might be a weird one. I have depression hair. For the past several years, I\u2019ve neglected my hair, opting to wear it in a frumpy and frizzy bun on top of my head. To be clear, it\u2019s not matted (anymore). There used to be long stretches between shampoos and detangles but I\u2019ve been working on taking better care of it. But I still can\u2019t break the habit of wearing it up. I\u2019m ready for a change. However, I don\u2019t know how to wear it or even take care of it. It\u2019s very fine and I have a lot of broken hair from the rubber band. I don\u2019t have a clue how to make it look cute. I don\u2019t need a fancy hairstyle or anything, I probably won\u2019t be able to stick to that. \n\nI\u2019d appreciate any tips or advice on breaking out of this hair-funk.",

I followed Brad Mondo\u2019s guide to cutting your hair and not ruining it on YT. Biggest tip I have is to get actual hair cutting scissors (not kitchen) and cut upwards like he shows you in the video, not straight across. I look so much better groomed after I cut my hair to my collarbones. \n\nI have fine hair with an oily scalp. I use Redken\u2019s Cleansing Cream when I go too long between washing and the oil builds up. It cuts through grease fast without drying out your hair too much. For regular washing I use Tresemme\u2019s Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner. I like this better than the fancy brands. \n\nFor detangling I use a brush that contains plastic bristles AND boar bristles. It makes detangling very fast. I use the Osensia detangling brush from Amazon. \n\nFor styling I use the Revlon one step dryer after my hair is mostly air dried. It\u2019s incredibly fast and easy. \n\nThat\u2019s it!",

She also has a podcast and other resources online. But I can definitely vouch for the book. Very simple and straightforward.",

Not sure of your hair texture though, but for her it\u2019s wash and go. Just long enough for a tiny ponytail. Works with headbands or clips. Best of all it only takes a minute or two to wash and brush. Good luck to you.",

            "comment": "I think the problem is moreso what makes you feel that Masturbation is bad? Is it a religious thing or a guilt thing? Because Masturbation is moderation is perfectly normal and fine, if you feel guilty about it, think about what makes you feel guilty? Is it the porn that you are masturbating to? If so, try substituting it with more Ethical porn, yes that exists, it's were the performing is in control of what is being made, is 100% consenting to what they are doing, and is not being exploited for money. You don't even have to watch porn, you can read it, which is what a lot of women do and what I recommend. \n\n\nGetting over this hump of feeling negative about a perfectly natural part of your body is they key here, Masturbation can be healthy in moderation and porn consumption okay in consensual situations.\n\nEdit:  Also if you want to just cut back, if its getting in the way, try finding something that occupies your full attention and will get your mind off of Masturbation. It can be anything from listening to music to reading a book, the moment you get past the initial urge, you will be fine.",

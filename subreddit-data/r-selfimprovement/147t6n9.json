    "postText": "Hi. I\u2019ve been stuck on this for a while and I want to gather as many opinions on this as possible. Dw I\u2019ve already done some research and spoken to advisors and family members, I just want as broad information as possible. \n\nI\u2019m currently finishing up my first year of university studying a physics degree. When I chose it I was pretty dumb and was oblivious to the graduate prospects. Looking back I realise that was a dumb oversight and now I want to rectify that. I\u2019d like to do a degree that has good graduate prospects, such as good pay, job satisfaction, and a good chance of being employed right out of university. I\u2019m not sure if physics necessarily cuts that. I was looking into stuff like finance and computer science, so I would be grateful for some advice on those. Keep in mind I have no previous experience in those subjects, so I\u2019m not sure how likely my university would accept that change. I\u2019m also open to possibly other fields. I\u2019m a good student and if my mind is set to something I can pretty much do anything. Just wondering what your thoughts are and if taking a risk like this is feasible. If you are a graduate in finance, CS, or physics I would also like to hear your experience job hunting post graduation.\n\nFor a little bit of background I\u2019m not super interested in anything at the moment so I\u2019m not really compelled to any one subject at university. I\u2019m really just in the mindset of maximising my opportunities now, so I avoid regret later.",

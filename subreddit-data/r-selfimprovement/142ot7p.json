    "postText": "I see stuff all the time about recognizing red flags in others and what to do it about. There\u2019s no shortage of help for those suffering from the criticisms (projections) of others. But what if *I\u2019m* the one with red flags? What if the critic is me? I\u2019ve gone to therapy (3 years now, actually made me feel worse for some reason), done the morning journaling, set intentions for my day and generally tried hard to be more mindful\u2026but I can\u2019t seem to shake the feeling that I\u2019m sabotaging everything good in my life because I have an entitled, cynical, critical, bad attitude about everything. I find myself offended at the smallest dumbest things, constantly. I know I\u2019m the bad guy, and I hate it.\n\nI spend a lot of mental energy telling myself to be better, be kinder, be more compassionate and caring. TBH, I\u2019m exhausted from going down the checklist of ways I\u2019ve been an asshole to people who love me. But no matter how hard I try, I truly can\u2019t seem to shake it. I hear stuff come out of my mouth before I\u2019ve even considered the repercussions of opening it. My internal dialogue is so critical. I can\u2019t hide it when I\u2019ve had a bad day or am in a mood. I\u2019ve tried, honest to God. \n\nWithout berating me further, please answer me this: Where\u2019s the help for a jerk like me?",

I say things sarcastically or with contempt. Or I criticize instead of just listening. And not in a blatantly nasty way, but an example would be when a friend was confiding in me about feeling down about her relationship and all I could seem to do was ask her in 100 different ways why she was even in a relationship that made her feel that way and she took a long pause and said \u201cwhy are you being so hard on me when I\u2019m only trying to confide in you? I need a friend\u2026\u201d - it humbled me real quick. But I do things like that all the time. The cuts of steak my SO made for us were small and I said \u201cis that all there is?\u201d instead of Thank you. \n\nI just hate it. I don\u2019t know how to stop being this way.",

            "comment": "Take responsibility: It's essential to take full responsibility for your actions and attitudes. Blaming others or external circumstances will only hinder your progress. Recognize that you have control over how you respond and behave, regardless of the situation.\r  \n\r  \nChallenge your entitlement: Entitlement can breed a negative and critical attitude. Take a hard look at your expectations and beliefs about what you deserve. Consider practicing gratitude and cultivating a mindset of humility and appreciation for the things and people in your life.\r  \n\r  \nDevelop empathy and compassion: Work on cultivating empathy and understanding towards others. Try to put yourself in their shoes and consider their perspectives. Practice actively listening to others without judgment and make a genuine effort to understand their experiences and emotions.\r  \n\r  \nPause before reacting: Learn to pause and reflect before responding, especially in moments when you feel offended or triggered. Taking a moment to consider the potential impact of your words or actions can help you respond in a more constructive and compassionate manner.\r  \n\r  \nSeek professional guidance: If therapy hasn't been effective for you so far, it might be worth considering a different therapist or therapeutic approach. Look for professionals who specialize in cognitive-behavioral therapy or anger management, as these can help address the negative attitudes and behaviors you're struggling with.\r  \n\r  \nPractice self-discipline: Changing ingrained patterns requires discipline and consistent effort. Set clear guidelines for yourself and hold yourself accountable for your words and actions. This might involve developing daily habits or adopting strategies to manage your emotions and reactions effectively.\r  \n\r  \nReflect and learn from your mistakes: Acknowledge the times when you've acted inappropriately or hurt others. Take time to reflect on these instances, identify the triggers, and learn from them. Use these experiences as opportunities for growth and commit to making amends and being better in the future.",

Things like \u201cconsider practicing gratitude\u201d seem vague and \u201clive-laugh-love-y\u201d to me. I\u2019ve tried it. I am truly grateful for the blessings in my life but a lot of the times I just feel deep down like I don\u2019t deserve them. And I also feel like I\u2019m constantly pulling the short end of the stick in so many other parts of my life, the blessings feel like little more than consolations sometimes. People have said \u201cof course you deserve blessings and happiness, we all deserve good things in our lives\u201d but I can\u2019t shake that feeling that they just don\u2019t know me like I know me. They don\u2019t know how hard I have to work to put on a nice face when I truly couldn\u2019t give af. It makes me feel like a real phony. \n\nI\u2019m not saying this isn\u2019t good advice, I\u2019m saying, what do I do when I\u2019ve tried these things and they just don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re landing?",

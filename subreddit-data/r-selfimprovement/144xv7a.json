Do not go overboard with the Protein powder.\n\nThen add this mixture to whole milk until you get a good texture and taste.\nWhen I do this one \"Shake\" has 800-1200 calories.\n\nThe most important part is that it tastes good and you do not need to force yourself to eat.\n\n\nAlternatively, if you do not own a blender:\n\n250g of curd,\n300g of mashed apples, unsugared,\nAdd some cinnamon,\nAdd 150-250g of oatmeal.\n\nMix Well. This is what I have for breakfast every day.",

I don't know your situation and I'm not judging you, but if you want to improve in something you have to spend some time analyzing and doing stuff.\nThe answer you are looking for is quite simple and you probably know it, but you are trying to make shortcuts. Like in college, in order to learn subjects, you have to go to classes and you have to study. These are your habits in order to be a good student.\nIn order to be healthy, you need to have some sort of physical activity, eat healthy food and have regular sleep. In my case I prefer to sleep around 7 hours (someone needs more, someone less, but in general from 7 to 8 hours of sleep should be good in most cases). For healthy food, I try to eat mostly meat and vegetables, and try to avoid snacks. Of caurse I eat stuff like pizza, pasta and deserts from time to time, but I try to avoid eating them every day. The most important thing, is to be aware of your self and your mistakes, and don't stress too much about them. If you made a mistake, that's cool, focus on your next day to be as good as it can get.\nI know this sounds simple, but it's not easy to persevere. You shouldn't look at this as something you are going to fix in 2 months, you should look at this as your future way of living. Imagine if you are this young today, and you are not feeling healthy atm, what can you expect to look like in 20 years?",

    "postText": "**How did my week go (05/06 - 011/06)?**\n\nThis week was worse than last week.\n\nThis week I felt super tired and lazy. Part of this is because of long-covid that I still get affected by, and because I relapsed. I had been going strong for nearly 2 months and was finding it easy. I barely got urges, and when I did, I managed them well. \n\nAfter a while, I started to feel my libido go almost completely. This caused fear I guess, and made me overthink too much about stuff. It seemed reasonable to relapse. Afterwards, I felt guilty and stupid and all that other shit I'm sure you're all too familiar with. It set my week up with some negative emotions.\n\nI noticed a lack of energy, confidence, and overall drive after relapsing. I lost clarity and focus on most of my tasks and daily actions. One of the most noticeable differences was how I presented myself in conversations - a lot more withdrawn.\n\nI maintained most of my daily disciplines and continued to be as social with people as possible, which is starting to make a noticeable difference.\n\nI didn't stick much at all to my routine as I planned, and I only complimented somebody on one of the days. This is better than none, but not my target of once a week that I had set!\n\nTo summarise: lots of room for improvement still, not better than last week, but not a complete spiral into degeneracy. \n\n**Positive Highlights of The Week:**\n\n1. 3rd Muay Thai session\n2. I didn't give up on my daily disciplines, even though I felt like quitting\n3. Wrote a high-value Reddit post that I am proud of\n4. Pushed myself during a swimming session\n\nNot too much considerable happened this week. I guess we'll call it a maintenance week. I'm grateful that I didn't dip back into my old habits and standards. Compared to how badly I used to fall this is a win.\n\n**Valuable Lessons Learnt This Week:**\n\n1. Being healthy is pointless if you're always tired or lacking in energy\n2. Mental shortcomings and ailments deserve just as much - if not more - attention than physical conditions\n3. Stop looking for a way to be happy. Instead, focus on things that are making you unhappy and remove them or change your opinion of them. This can help if you overcomplicate things or don't know where to start.\n\nI'd say I'm quite a healthy person.\n\nI eat pretty clean, I work out 5-6 days a week, I meditate, have good hygiene, etc.\n\nAll you ever hear is \"health is wealth\". And although I would be considered healthy, my energy to do things was anything but that. This made most of my ability to do things \"unhealthy\" if that makes sense.\n\nIf my energy levels were better I know I would have got more done this week. Covid has taught me a valuable lesson in this regard and has led me to research how to increase levels of energy and got me focused more on cardio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf people got a sudden infection or nasty-looking spot they would see a medical professional with haste (if they're sensible, that is). However, when it comes to mental problems that shape how people see reality, people completely disregard it.\n\nGaining a greater understanding and perception of myself has been invaluable. If not for focusing on improving my paradigms, I would be in a terrible place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What held me back this week:**\n\n1. Giving into impulses too much\n2. Not sticking to my routine (still)\n3. Getting carried away with daydreams (still)\n\nI find that if I lack discipline in one area then it bleeds into every other. I am going to bare this in mind and be stricter from now on. I've noticed how much less focus I have when undisciplined. It causes a lot more restlessness and anxiety.\n\nGetting carried away by thoughts has always been a big problem of mine; I find it too damn addicting! I plan to meditate more this week and snap myself out of thought when I get attached to them from now on to break the habit.\n\n**My Plans For Next Week:**\n\n1. Redo goals and vision-board\n2. Focus much more heavily on writing and improving my ability (4 articles this week + course enrolment)\n3. Stick to daily disciplines\n4. Stick to routine\n5. Set aside more time to read\n6. Dedicate time to practice typing every day\n\nA lot of these are much more writing-dedicated. I'm not working this week, so I want to make the most of this time to get myself out there more and hone my craft. This involves refining the clarity surrounding my future self + goals, maintaining my mental health, and learning more to provide more value.\n\nTyping incorrectly and slowly is becoming an issue. I make so many mistakes with my writing and it's starting to make my wrists hurt. Thus, I will now become a nerd and type like a maniac for some time every day.\n\n**A Quote + What I Am Reading:**\n\n&gt;*\"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so\" - Hamlet*\n\nStill on Discourses by Epictetus. Goated book. Taking a while soak in all the information. I also decided to take a break from writing tools and focus solely on discourses for the time being.\n\n**Concluding Thoughts**\n\nNothing much more to say. Wasn't the best week, but could have been much worse. I'm proud of what I have accomplished despite how I was feeling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

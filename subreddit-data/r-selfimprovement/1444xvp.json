I have been better since i realized that the world wants trans people to hate themselves (i\u2019m MtF) and was just thinking about the amount of people that probably let self hatred get in the way of their lives. Anyways, what are you guys\u2019 thoughts on self hatred, because it\u2019s been a breakthrough for me. Thank you for your time :)",

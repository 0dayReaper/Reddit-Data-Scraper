    "postText": "i recently started working at a new workplace and there's a girl that i really like. We were talking a couple of times and really vibing. i liked talking to her and felt a sparkle that i didnt feel with the other girls around here. The weird thing is that now (like 1-2 weeks after our last great convo. keep in mind that its not an office work, meaning we dont go to work everyday and its a dynamic schedule) i feel like the sparkle is not there and maybe i romanticized it in my head. When messaging her the conversation is not pulling off and feels unnatural. The absurd here is that im having better flowing convo's with her friend, but im not interested in her. i mean, why doesnt my rizz work on her like on other girls?\n\ni started to think that i romanticized it in my head and maybe she's not feeling the same way i feel or maybe not interested in me. There's another option which is that she doesn't notice that im interested in her so she's not responding with the same affection an interest as if she would if she knew there could be something between us... \n\nim really bummed out and dont know what did i do wrong and why couldn't i hit on her and get a mutual interest as im able to do with other girls. I dont know how can i pull her interest back in me because we dont work together often so i dont see her that much. Should i keep messaging her, hoping that something would rise from this? Another option would be to schedule a meeting with her only me and her (not anyone else from work) and confess my love and that im interested in her - maybe thats what she need to hear to realize that it could work. or maybe she'd tell me its not mutual. either way i'd get an answer (i mean, \"you miss 100% of the opportunities you dont take\" - Michael Scott)\n\nWhat do you think i should do? would love to hear from you",

            "comment": "That last option is a one way ticket to HR for harassment. I don't think you did anything wrong (at least only knowing your side).  But if she's not vibing she's not.  Don't try and force it. \n\nI go to gym classes that are probably 60-70% women and you just gotta hang out and test the waters.",

Also if you get fired for asking a girl out once and do not press it, chances are that the HR department sucks and a new job is needed. If she makes it awkward after that when he follows the rules, then she is the problem and her insecurities are an issue. Bullet dodged.",

It can also be construed as harassment because you can/could have them cornered because of it.  (Depends if it's an office environment).  \n\nIf they ask during a lunch or coffee break it is different because the other party has a clear out.",

It doesn\u2019t work.\n\nSparks are mutual and you can not force it, the more you force it, the more you\u2019re likely to push her away.\n\nWhen I wasn\u2019t looking for love, that\u2019s when I found it.",

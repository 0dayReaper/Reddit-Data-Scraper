I was shooting about 6g of meth a day and I know I have a long road ahead of me but im just so fucking happy I tested clean and am on the road to recovery.\n\nIm trying to not get ahead of myself but I am beyond grateful to be alive right now. 28 days inpatient and I haven\u2019t been this excited to be alive in a while.\n\nThanks for reading. I\u2019m literally just so happy right now and didn\u2019t know who else to express it to.",

That sounds almost impossible. How the hell are you alive?\n\nEdit: I have no experience with meth so I looked up the IV dosage. According to psychonautwiki, 40mg is a strong dose. I know tolerance is a thing but I still don't understand how one would do literally A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TIMES that dose in a single day. I don't know if anyone could survive that\n\nEdit 2: So according to a scientific paper \"The toxic dose varies considerably due to individual variations and the development of tolerance. Fatalities have been reported following ingestion of doses as low as 1.3 mg/kg, while tolerance has been developed to 1000 mg at a time and up to 5 g\" \n\nSo apparently it's possible. Still cannot wrap my head around it. Anyway, I hope you make a full recovery!",

Just remember that there will be setbacks and failures along the way. The road to recovery is a bumpy one, but as long as you keep moving forward, you'll be alright.\n\nAlso, see if you can pick up a new hobby. It's a good idea to give the brain something to do (and especially something new to learn) to promote neuroplasticity and recovery. At least, that was my experience but I never used nearly as heavily. Still, it won't hurt. \n\nSending love &lt;3",

I was sent into a K-hole where the only thoughts I could think were along the lines of \"I'm trapped forever in an endlessly looping vegetative state\". Once that wore off and I got back home, I began to feel a lot better and clear-headed. That brings us to now, I haven't really slept, but I feel better, and I'm just taking things a day at a time and hoping it doesn't wear off.

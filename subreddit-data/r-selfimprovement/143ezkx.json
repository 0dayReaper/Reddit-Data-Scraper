I think it all started with getting the virus or the shots 1,5-2 years ago but maybe that is Imagination. I still do my training Routine of running, cycling and weightlifting. In April i startet fixing this with enormes amounts of caffeine, on 600mg+ i felt good, awake and active but this neither healty nor sustainable \n\nIs there a way to feel not tired like shit every day?",

            "comment": "Would you say that you feel tired mentally and/or physically? If you're dealing with physical tiredness, perhaps it is time to reflect on your activities throughout the day and reconsider working out so much. Of course, you know your body the best, but perhaps you are putting too big a strain on your body with running/cycling/hitting the gym.\n\nIf you would say that you are mentally tired, i.e. moody, mood swings, high levels of irritability, trouble focussing, you should consider changing aspects such as (someone else already commented here) your time engaging with social media or screens in general. Another thing: you mention that you have generally seven hours of sleep, but would you say that you go to bed and wake up at around the same time? During my time in university, I only fell asleep at around 2:30 A.M., woke up around 11:30 A.M., and, despite having nine hours of sleep that night, still feel like crap. Just some more information on your lifestyle/hobbies would possibly offer a better idea of why you're struggling with tiredness. How old are you? Do you have a specific diet? What line of work/study are you in?\n\nFollow-up question: do you drink or smoke, or use drugs?",

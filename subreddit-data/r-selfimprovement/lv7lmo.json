    "postText": "I realised about a year ago, that I\u2019d picked up a trait from my mother, wherein I would not be present in conversations. \nInstead I\u2019d be trying to find a way to agree / disagree with the person about a point, and then direct the conversation towards being about MY experience of said thing.\n\nIt\u2019s been hard, like rewiring my brain, but I hope I\u2019ve become more stoic and thoughtful.\nI was an obnoxious extrovert who had no privacy, shared everything online, and never thought before I spoke. \n\nThis post is actually just me talking about me, but I guess it\u2019s good to share these things. If you think you\u2019re too \u2018much\u2019 sometimes, it could be because you are seeking approval from external things. Whereas true happiness comes from finding the quiet calm, the \u2018home\u2019 within you. \nOnce you find this place, you\u2019ll see that your friend list is narrowed down. You\u2019ll seek only true friends who align with your values, experiences that bring you purpose and fulfilment and you\u2019ll find a calm quiet centre within :)",

But it would also seem the person on the other side of that conversation has to take some ownership of the problem here. You see, I agree with you that talking about yourself way too much can come across as obnoxious, but there\u2019s some context that needs to be taken here. Sharing your thoughts, experiences or opinions about things often, is a great way to iterate your points. For many, this is an attempt to display sincere empathy and enthusiasm for what someone else is taking about. It does require effective punctuating though and not to be used in every sentence, of course. Generalising this concept risks turning big and exciting characters into censored, repressed individuals. Sharing experiences is totally fine, and using it to try to understand someone else\u2019s point of view, or engage in conversation is actually a great way of communicating. Just don\u2019t be boastful, or change the conversation topic to your stories. Encourage the continuance of the conversation instead and request feedback about what you just said to deflect attention back. For example, as the other person if you were accurate in thinking the feelings you spoke about were like theirs by saying things like \u2018is that what you meant by that?\u2019 or \u2018was your experience similar to mine?\u2019 That way you don\u2019t come across as obnoxious anymore, rather you come across as interesting but also engaged with the conversation. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re on the other side of this type of conversation habit, try to read more into the nuances of what they\u2019re saying. You might be surprised by what you find. Maybe they\u2019re trying to impress you, or they want you to like them. Maybe you\u2019ve hit a nerve, or triggered a powerful memory. Try not to assume people using this conversation habit are self centred, most people aren\u2019t in my experience. \n\nFunnily enough I\u2019m going to do it myself now, I also experienced what you\u2019re talking about. I used to talk about myself in the wrong types of way all the time, I was frequently called arrogant and it did warrant a desire in me to change my conversation habit. But I never felt like I was being self centred, I\u2019d always thought I was trying to contribute value in the conversation. But it did turn out I hadn\u2019t done it in the right way. And it still is a bad habit of mine at times. I guess the truth of it is, I\u2019m simply not the best conversationalist.",

It was just me me me.\n\nYou\u2019re SO right, learning to listen allows you to have / display sincere empathy and enthusiasm. It makes conversations open up, you get to live in the moment and have discussions.\n\nI find myself straying away from friends / family who I know turn every discussion into a memoir of theirs, I just mentally log off now, or politely steer the conversation back.\n\nYour paragraph about trying not to assume people are self centred opened my eyes, I do find myself being quite cynical, but upon reflection I do believe I was hanging round with very shallow, vacuous people for a while.\n\nReally enjoyed your comment, will read again to get it to sink in.

            "comment": "I think this is really good advice. Everyone likes it if you are a good listener. In \"The Elephant in the Brain\" they claim that it is human nature to prefer speaking to listening because we evolved to want to show off our skills to be seen as a good ally or mate. But this means we can be seen as adding value just by speaking less while simultaneously gaining information from the other person.\n\nBut sometimes I just really need to rant about something but I don't want to rant to my friends and make a bad impression and be seen as a complainer.\n\nSo I started a website that lets people do that.",

Seeing many comments express this sentiment, I see it as important to describe why.\n\nThere is value in folks who are willing to hand out their side of a story, in fine print. Now, it can be rather haphazardous, if not properly regulated, but when it's information that isn't potentially harmful to share, these people are those you can often trust to be genuine. \n\nThey readily show who they are, and so have the privilege of knowing how the world truly sees them. They learn who will truly stick by their side, through thick and thin. All problems are laid out on the table, and addressed. You don't have to anxiously wonder how they *really* feel about a situation: you just ask, or observe. I find it comforting to be around someone so transparent. When you\u2019re quiet, and start to grow distressed by your thoughts, it can be nice to be stimulated by the company of another person, who is passionately filling the silence.\n\nIf you prefer keeping to yourself, and avoiding people who enjoy explaining their thoughts, that's your business. Let's refrain from framing those who differ from you as mindless chatterboxes, though. There are plently of folks who tend to speak as they think, processing ideas more clearly, in doing so. Much like a verbal check-list, or diary.",

I was far too loud loud, obnoxiously so and any thought that came into my head would blurt out my mouth.

While I was concerned by what you said, it was you, describing your own situation, and I have no say in what that entails. Writing to yourself is a great way to connect to yourself, and focus on your behavior, so I'm glad you were able to use it for improvement. \n\nMost of my comment was spurred on by seeing others (mainly in response to you) describe talkative, or open behavior as annoying, dull, or inherently negative. I am too shy of a person, often asked to repeat myself, talk more, or speak up, and honestly feel quite jealous of those who can throw out their words so clearly, and quickly. Seeing what I want essentially written off as worthless by random folks was frustrating. My friends, for the most part, are fairly chatty, and loud, as well.

I did think I was too much and see now that I CAN listen and think more and speak less. I then remembered that people spend time and money on retreats to do that exact thing. I jest yet it helps so many people recenter themselves. So however it comes, enjoy the silence within and around you. Way to go not continuing parental trends.",

Our tongue is like a pistol loaded with words that can possibly hurt everyone listening to it once you pull the trigger.\n\nThat's why in our circle of friends I'm the one who always keep reconciling each other once they made mistakes coz of just spitting words or posting without thinking if it can hurt someone or not.",

Now and then, the thought \"you've to say a statement instead of asking questions\" pops up in my mind. And I go too far sometimes and share too much. But you've to experience both the sides before you come back to the centre, and stay there.",

I've found that people who constantly take over a conversation don't value themselves and feel the need to prove their value to others by spinning stories, showing how much they know, etc. And usually, all they say is bs.",

If you are having trouble talking about anything but your own demise stop and get pro help.  Because it\u2019s not your friends job to hear it every day and it will wear on them .  They aren\u2019t trained professional crisis\u2019 councilors .  They are just the knuckleheads you chose to watch tv and crack jokes with.  If you put them to work they won\u2019t like it",

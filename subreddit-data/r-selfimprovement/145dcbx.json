It was a good read and I enjoyed the useful, concise advice, and I especially appreciated the examples given at the start of each chapter.\n\nWith little effort, I am able to apply the rules he set down. So cool, I have a better way to get better habits and get rid of old ones.\n\nBut I really need help with my anxiety and tendency to get too far into my head! Any books y'all recommend?",

            "comment": "Hey :)\n\nI understand what you\u2019re asking, it\u2019s like \u201cwhat is that book that has the big points without the fluff\u201d. I\u2019ve read well over a 100 personal development books, and  a good few about fear/anxiety (coming from an utter terror, psychosis, checking myself into hospital kind of anxiety). And to be authentic with you, although you are definitely able to garner a bit of insight from these books, particularly if you read, re-read and compile/contemplate them, most of them are a fairly Band-Aidy\u2026 \n\nThe issue is that most of these books work on the level of behaviour and conditioning. But most of behaviour and conditioning stems from feeling. And most of feeling stems from thought patterns (as you may have read in atomic habits). And then most of these thought patterns have deeper, basically unconscious roots (core beliefs/identity). So with most of this personal development stuff, we prune a few leaves off, feel great! But if it\u2019s emotional wounding, fear, panic, deep sadness we\u2019re dealing with\u2026 we\u2019re trying to tackle a t-Rex with a nerf gun\u2026\n\nSo here\u2019s something else; check out No Bad Parts, or Internal Family Systems (if you want to go deeper) by dr richard schwartz. This book is valuable. It\u2019s going to help you better contact the parts of you where this is actually stemming from. The beauty of this is that we can put down that nerf gun and actually befriend this t-Rex. When we\u2019re able to accept and work with the parts of us that these emotions emanate from, we start to make deep progress with healing. I hope you take me up on this. You\u2019ll save time. \n\nBest of luck! \ud83d\udcda",

It IS worth it, over a lifetime, when you look at all the benefits, but it really looks like they're overcharging to fund other projects.\n\nYou've got it completely ass-backwards.\n\nTM is the meditation-outreach program of [Jyotirmath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyotir_Math) \u2014 the primary center-of-learning/monastery for Advaita Vedanta in Northern India and the Himalayas \u2014 and TM exists *because*, in the eyes of the monks of Jyotirmath, the secret of real meditation had been lost to virtually all of India for many centuries, until [Swami Brahmananda Saraswati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmananda_Saraswati) was appointed to be the first person to hold the position of Shankaracharya [abbott] of Jyotirmath in 165 years. More than 65 years ago, a few years after his death, [the monks of Jyotirmath sent one of their own into the world to make real meditation available to the world,](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-good-ways-to-learn-Transcendental-Meditation-without-an-instructor/answer/Lawson-English-1) so that you no longer have to travel to the Himalayas to learn it. \n\n.\n\nBefore TM, it was considered impossible to learn real meditation without an enlightened guru; the founder of TM changed that by creating a secular training program for TM teachers who are trained to teach as though they were the founding monk themselves. You'll note in that last link that the Indian government recently issued a commemorative postage stamp honoring the founder of TM for his \"original contributions to Yoga and Meditation,\" to wit: that TM teacher training course and the technique that people learn through trained TM teachers so that they *don't* have to go learn meditation from the abbott of some remote monastery in the Himalayas.\n\n.\n\nVedic Meditation is a term coined a decade or so ago by a former TM teacher named Thom Knowles, who started his own meditation school, teaching meditation teachers according to his own course, rather than using the meditation teacher training course devised by the founder of TM.\n\nI don't know if it works the same way as TM or not, but thus far, he has refused to publish ANY research on his practice at all, [which has led to interesting lawsuits as he insists that it works \"just like TM\" without any proof of that.](https://www.foxnews.com/us/legal-feud-over-teaching-of-transcendental-meditation-technique-is-anything-but-peaceful)\n\n\nThe term \"Transcendental Meditation\" first appeared in the ENglish language in the early 1960s and became most common in the 1970s when the foudner of TM appeared on myriad talk shows in the space of a year or two , [as you can see by looking at google's word search engine of all 3 million+ books they have archived.](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Transcendental+Meditation%2C+Transcendental+meditation%2C+transcendental+Meditation%2C+Transcendental+Meditation&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=en-2019&amp;smoothing=3)\n\n\"Vedic Meditation\" didn't become a thing in the English language until Thom Knowles broke away from the TM organization, [as shown by the same google search.](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Vedic+Meditation%2C+Vedic+meditation%2C+vedic+Meditation%2C+vedic+meditation&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=en-2019&amp;smoothing=3)\n\n.\n\n\nACEM was also founded by a former TM teacher, back in  the 1960s. He eliminated every aspect of hte practice he considered \"woo.\" INterestingly, the only EEG study on ACEM that I am aware of mentions the EEG coherence signature of TM, but fails to report it in ACEM.\n\nThe \"woo\" is there for a reason.\n\n.\n\nFun trivial thing: apparently Hugh Jackman learned Vedic Meditaiton 20 years ago but when after he met Bob Roth, CEO of the David Lynch Foundation, who trained Jackman's son to meditate, Jackman and his wife decided to learn TM so that they could become official [non-compensated] spokesmen for the DLF and the TM organization.\n\n[Jackman recounts this fact at the lanuch of Bob Roth's book, which he and his wife MCed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahdl7qLr7KQ) and [he continues to promote TM even today.](https://www.tm.org/course-fee)\n\n.\n\nNow, the TM organization doesn't fund other projects via course fees. They do however, provide scholarship money. \n\n[If you look at their IRS form 990 for the last 10 years](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/43196447), they try to maintain a roughly zero balance, losing a bit of money one year, netting a million or two the next year.\n\n[The DLF however, is almost entirely donation-run, and they DO do large scale projects, like teaching entire school districts or even the high schools of entire state to meditate for free.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT7LPN0MI-U)",

This book provides practical strategies and exercises for managing anxiety and phobias, and can be a helpful resource for those looking to better understand and cope with their symptoms. Other books that may be helpful include \"The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety\" by John P. Forsyth and Georg H. Eifert, and \"The Worry Cure\" by Robert L. Leahy.",

Once you learn strategies that help calm your nervous system (No screens after 8pm, no murder TV, deep breathing, meditation, interrupting automatic negative thoughts, whatever you choose) I think it would be wise to incorporate them using tips from Atomic Habits. Because knowing what to do isn't the same as doing it enough to feel the benefits. Best wishes.",

    "postText": "I'm hoping I'm not as alone as I think I am. I'm turning 28 next week. I'm experiencing what's called \"men-opause.\" Where I'm so far into a career, I've realized I climbed the wrong mountain. Although I proved to myself I can climb one, something doesn't feel right. I'm physically fit. And have few good friends. But something just isn't right deep down.\n\nI'm an ok artist &amp; am capable of drawing portraits. This is my true passion. But I've never had guidance or a mentor. I'm not going to talk about every detail in my life. But I need serious help. My mental health feels like it's deteriorating. I refuse to seek a therapist. A community makes me more comfortable.\n\nIf anyone has overcome this situation, feel free to comment. This is my final attempt.",

When I'm saying flow i mean the psychological flow, the one that needs to rise from an engaging activity and not a frustrating one.\n\nTrying coding a website without coding knowledge, trying to animate a 3D scene without 3D-software experience or trying to write a compelling book without narrative knowledge, you will only get frustrated.\n\nThe biggest problem i found when I want to create something is that I'm too much a citizen of the city of ideas and this can be in contrast with my resident permit in the city of real skillls. In these situation you can feel a sensation of captivity.\n\nWhen you want to create something, wether is for utility or enjoyment, the city of ideas is permeated with the flow, since all the dots come together, you can imagine your result, but in the end you conclude it's only in your mind.\n\nWhen you try imagining how to replicate it in reality, it starts the panicking, if that's the case your creative mind is going too far for your technical skills.\nYou need to test yourself and realize that resolving easier problems is resolving your own big problem. On your computer or on your papers the two are distinct puzzles, but in your mind everything is knotted together.\nAnd this is the hard part to get right:\n\n**Your original idea can improve from bad/mediocre to a better form if you know better how can be realized.**\n\nAll these thing to say that sometimes it feels like what we want to do is too hard and complex for us to even start, maybe we have little to zero experience of some skills needed to do it, but skills can be made, if you really believe in your idea or in your goal, approach it like a game, to reach the final level you need to get through all of the one before, and every level will bring hard things to understand or complete, but also the satisfaction of achieving victory. (this is a very simple definition of the flow)\n\nThen when you have started gaining confidence in your skills start attempting to that goal, maybe with a simpler version, probably you will never get it \"as good as imagined\", but you can return to that idea many times as you get more experienced.\n\nThe better thing of wanting to create is that **there'll always be room for something new, you're never too late to try**, nature and reality is quite boring if you really think about it, if we didn't need them we as humans wouldn't have create art, science, design or engineering, but we did.",

    "postText": "I have a problem with wanting everyone to like me or want to be me. I recently had a baby and my life took a turn. I gained weight and my party life is over. I feel like a fraud. I don\u2019t like going to stores because I don\u2019t want anybody from highschool to see me and talk about how fat I got or how ugly I look. I just wish nobody had a bad opinion on me and I would be just fine. This has been going on for a year and it\u2019s deeper than how it\u2019s sounds it\u2019s really holding me back from going anywhere having fun anywhere it\u2019s like I hide under a rock. How can I stop this",

Who am I now that I have an adorable and much-loved baby with me constantly.  \n\nMy suggestion is that you carve out some time to focus on yourself.  Maybe this means going to the gym if you want to work on being more fit.  Maybe this is skin care if you don\u2019t have someone to keep the baby while you go out.  \n\nWhy you care so much about what others think is closely related to self-esteem.  Work on feeling better about yourself and your value (just as you are) and you will care less and less about what others think. It\u2019s also an age thing\u2026younger people care more about what others think.  \n\nGet out of the house, mama. You\u2019ll feel better for it. Promise.",

    "postText": "What are some good supplements to take that'll generally optimise my health and wellbeing? Currently I take vitamin D most days, and zinc about 3x a week. I've heard good things about omega 3 and magnesium, though I have no clue about the long term benefits of these. Any others I'm missing?\n\nside note:  recently I've come to the realisation, primarily thanks to Hamza, how awful tap water is , even though it deceivingly seems like a good idea to drink more. Do I have any good options other than buying bottles of water? I've also seen some charcoal filters (not the ones that fit onto taps, the ones you put in a bottle/glass) but not sure if these are effective. \n\nAny advice would benefit me greatly, thank you.",

You keep it in your fridge when you\u2019re not using it. Whatever the top of the line filtration they have for that thing. Take a note of reviews, efficacy, and this is important, filtration speed.\n\nI have a camping filter by Lifestraw and it\u2019s 100% but it does about 1 drop per 3 seconds.",

    "postText": "\nI can't do anything right for anyone, my mom hates me for it, my dad is disappointed, my siblings think they handle everything when I'm the one holding sht together. The minute I leave the house is in shambles and there's sht everywhere, dishes stacked to the ceiling messes everywhere, no spot to sit and it looks like an episode of Hoarders. My mom is borderline mentally abusive but no one believes me, they all think I'm blowing things out of proportion and I'm just a sad rebellious teenager who needs to suck it up. But I'm not. I'm different, I want to do better, I want to be there, I want to help, I want to do sht right! But no one ever sees my trying. No one gives a fck about me. I walk passed my family with tears down my fcking face, fists clenched, wanting to die but no one gives a single fck. I try to tell my mom something important and she doesn't give a f*ck, she doesn't care, I'm just a stupid teenager. I don't have feelings, I don't know anything. I hate myself bc I'm weak, I can't control my emotions, I cry all the time, I yell at everyone, nothings right that I do, I just hate it.\n\nIdk... What do I do?",

At these times sometimes I will fall asleep into a nap, or it as is.\n\n&gt; You\u2019re allowed to take a break.\n\n&gt; You\u2019re allowed to take a break thinking the positive thoughts, negative thoughts, positive feelings, negative feelings.\n\n&gt; You can absolutely take a break.\n\n&gt; Similarly, a similar exercise for a relaxation time is, you can absolutely leverage your imagination to provide you happiness.\n\n&gt; You already know you\u2019re leveraging it the other way: to your displeasure.",

    "postText": "I feel as if It\u2019s possible for me to land dates , I\u2019ve lost tons of weight and I\u2019ve improved my style a ton. I\u2019m 19M. I\u2019ve been rejected at least 6 times so far this year and I\u2019m too depressed to ask more women out. I just feel like I have nothing to offer. I have bad hours at work so my money is low, I have no car (yet), no abs and I\u2019m not ripped as yet, I have slight ptosis on one of my eyes and chalazion on the other which a $300 steroid shot hasn\u2019t helped. \n\nA part of me just feels like I\u2019ve I get down to a low enough weight, and look like an average skinny guy and keep styling my hair, maybe dye it. Maybe then I\u2019ll get a date. All the women I\u2019ve approached have been super chill about it, some even wanted to friend zone me and chit chat with me but I couldn\u2019t do that to myself again. A lot of them called me cool and told me how flattered they were. I never got a ew etc. I also went to boarding my school in part of highschool and lots of women had crushes on me but I had no game. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m heading.",

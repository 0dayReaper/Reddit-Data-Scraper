People can do the same thing and enjoy their lives (ala hobbies, all the self improvement practices people preach). \n\nThere\u2019s also an unhealthy rejection of who you are now. You can be content and still make your life better, dissatisfaction is not the only reason to take action. \n\nThe choice is ours but the issue is we keep saying we know the \u201cright choice\u201d without actually considering our objections. We gaslight ourselves that \u201cx is good\u201d and repeat the same cycle because we \u201cknow better\u201d which is not true, if we knew better we\u2019d do it. You do what you do because you have a reason to do so.",

    "postText": "I realized that I have lived a boring life all my life and had nothing going on with me. All my life I was depressed for being socially awkward, having strict religious parents, being made to study only, and not having a social life. When I started putting myself in a social situation I noticed that people have niche hobbies and have interesting life experience. They are able to have a light hearted and witty conversations. I feel so stunted and empty which makes me even more depressed and unmotivated. I am 25 years old and I feel like it\u2019s too late to change myself. Last year I started reading a bit and recent started to develop hobbies like rock climbing, swimming, drawing, painting, playing chess and sudoku, watching different types of  movies and listening to different music genres. I want to be able to connect with people without seeming like I am trying too hard to impress people. I simply want to be more interesting to other people to keep friends.",

When it comes to reading I realized that I liked reading about historical figures. From time to time I enjoy watching some movies as well.",

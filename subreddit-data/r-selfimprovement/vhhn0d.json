Some might argue against it but for me it was having someone else cause pain, caring for it in the week to follow an getting a new one when it became to difficult. Exercise like long serious cardio also helped. Pain, chocolate, spicy food and cardio can all release the same feel good chemicals. There are tons of alternatives online and I do think it depends on why you self harm. To much emotions? Journaling or art can help. Chemicals? Any of what I mentioned plus I'm sure more. I'm not sure if it's around but I once found an article listing alternatives for different reasons or parts of self harm ie the visual watered down red paint or markers, etc.",

In the past when I just stopped I would use a red pen en draw red cuts where I usually cut. The scratching feeling and the visualls kinda helped but not too much. I feel like there should be blood. The feeling of my blood flowing out in combination with pain and adrenaline. I think that's what I want and achieve with cutting. One time I pretty deep (to the fat layer)  and the wound spread open and it started bleeding like hell. I would wait and let it bleed and hurt for some time just because it felt so good before I would go to the ER",

It has its own brand of pain, and the endorphins I get when I do it is really cathartic. I used to self harm too and eating incredibly spicy food has a way of shooting the right kind of adrenaline and endorphins for me that feels so damn good.\n\nIdk if it will work for you like that but it's worth a shot.",

Thankfully i had a close friend call me at that exact moment just to chat. I chose to find a reason to live on.. i will say that fishing became my outlet. Learning became a hobby. Learning anything and everything i could about building, cars, landscaping, fishing, electrical. I still get depressed, its ok to cry, the body actually releases stress that way. When i do, i go fishing. Its usually calming for me, my happy place. Try to find yours, it will help you in years to come. Plus, iv gotten some epic catches!",

Life is still shit and i feel like it's getting worse again. I'm falling deeper again. It probably won't take long before I'm suicidal again",

Anyone that tries to make you believe the only way to improvement is up, they are lying to you and setting you in a spiral down the hole.\n\nNot relapsing, in such an early stage, is a hell of an improvement.\n\nI never cut myself so I can't give you any advice on how not to do it anymore. But I can tell you that if it happens, you don't need to feel guilty about, because it's normal. And if you feel guilty, try to deal with that first and remembering you deserve love and that you're not a failure. \n\nSadly you will probably relapse (and I'm not trying to discourage you, just preparing), as it is an habit and a strategy you developed to deal with certain things. So, you need to find better strategies and create an habit around them while you leave the old one.\n\nIt's not easy, it takes time, discipline and self will.\n\nThat's why I told you: every time you feel like you'll relapse to come here. Then you'll have people to remind you why you're finding a better way. Or to easy the pain of guilt if you eventually do it.\n\nIt's important not to be/feel alone and have support and feel we are loved.\n\nAnd you are loved ;)",

Can I make it through today?\nI love that others have come along with coping mechanisms that helped them! And while adulthood can be a lot, you will find as others said, this kind of thing and the shit you'll catch from others eases up as you get older! You're growing and that's something to be so excited about! Best wishes to you today and always \ud83d\udc96",

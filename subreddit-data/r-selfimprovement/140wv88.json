    "postText": "I feel like this has been slowly building up over time, and now I'm just this constantly guarded person who wont let anyone in. At first this only happened in periods of time, but now if I think about it, its always at the back of my mind when I'm interracting with somone. Basically I never allow myself tot hink that someone genuinely likes me. I'm always subconsciously searching for certain expressions in people that show that they're annoyed or bored with me. My mind is always searching for \"proof\" that someone doesn't like me. For example, someone in my family goes out without me, and I'm like \"oh see they don't like you that much\". Which is so unhealthy, like I can\"t imagine being in any kind of relationship with someone like me. Speaking of which I don't usually complain about it, but once in a while I have asked people in my life if they hate me, or maybe I'm quiet because I don't feel like someone wants to talk to me. Still, I can imagine those moments are annoying and confusing to someone. Because I recognize I might be wrong, I try to keep it to myself as much as I can.\n\nIts also not good for me, like I'm basically not allowing myself to have relationships with anyone. Where this gets a bit confusing is that one of my parents has always been a bit more strict and angry with us, and thats probably where I started feeling like this. I remember even thinking as a kid that they don't like me. But even if I think about it, I conclude they still love me. Even after talking to them about it they told me not to ever worry about that. But its hard for me to accept on an emotional level I guess. My other parent is very loving and caring and listens, and I still am convinced that they secretly don't like me. Thats when I realized that maybe I'm the problem here, because this parent obviously unconditionally loves me. \n\nI also feel some amount of jealousy towards my sibling. These days I've somehow convinced myself that my parents see them as the favorite child. I think its because they've been paying a lot of attention to my siblings issues and mental health lately. Which of course is good, I'm glad they're doing it. But I can't help but feel really jealous for some reason, maybe because I feel like they never paid enough attention to mine.\n\nWhen I've seeked help from others about this before, or even just when I look it up to see other people who have experienced not feeling loved enough, a lot of people say its the family's fault. I just have this feeling though that its not my family's fault, I'm just being so oversensitive to everything these days. I really want to learn how to stop though so I can perserve my relationship with my family.",

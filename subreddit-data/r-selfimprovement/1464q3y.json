    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI wanted to share that lately, I've been experiencing a loss of interest in various aspects of my life. I find myself constantly having lustful thoughts, and I've noticed a decline in my coordination and clumsiness. Specifically, I'm finding it challenging to maintain my motivation to learn new skills related to my job as a software engineer. Additionally, I'm struggling with focus, and this has resulted in me being let go from my jobs on multiple occasions. I'm reaching out for your assistance and guidance. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you.",

Additionally, finding a community of like-minded individuals can provide support and inspiration.\r To improve your focus, consider setting specific goals and breaking them down into smaller, achievable tasks. And have you heard of the Forfeit app? It's a cool tool where you can set tasks for yourself and risk losing some money if you don't complete them. It adds a fun challenge and can keep you accountable.\r Don't forget to take care of yourself too! Prioritize self-care, get enough rest, and make time for activities that bring you joy.",

Take another personality test online, answer honesty.\n\nAnd the change could manifested from physiological contributions like Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, etc, in which case you may want to visit a doctor to get your health checked up.

I don't know if I'm the only one thinking about it but it's baffling that you trick your own brain or hack it, in order to feel better. In the sense that you need to look at it from another perspective, push yourself with new thought patterns, decide on not believing anything your mind gives you....I believe in it, and I'm experiencing it a lot through therapy, it works, but still it's interesting how tricking yourself can lead to great results, that the poison and the cure are in the same bottle \ud83e\udd14\nAnyone else thinking about it?\ud83d\ude05",

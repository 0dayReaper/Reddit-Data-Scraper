    "postText": "I\u2019m a 26 years old woman and due to some circumstances I have  no social life. I also never had a relationship. I\u2019ve had some difficult years but now I would like to start over. I\u2019m graduating with my associate degree in accounting at the end of the month. After graduating I will start working fulltime at my internship place. Now i\u2019m hesitating going for the bachelor or not. This will take me 3-4 years of 20 hours a week beside my fulltime job. During these years I will also have less time to socialize.\nWhat would you do: going for my study or going for a social life?",

            "comment": "The problem may seem to be very big at first but I think you need to think about it in a more practical way.\n\nIf you go down the study route, why not start socializing with your classmates or people with whom you are going to be working with. Not spending a ton of time with them but maybe once in two weeks.\n\nThis will help you to get in the habit of talking to new people. Getting your degree will also help you immensely in the future. I think this gets you the best of both worlds as you will have a degree as well as experience after a couple of years.",

If you like your job a lot and people not so much then go get that degree and then eventual bag. If you don\u2019t really like your job and it\u2019s just to pay bills and your too tired to socialize all the time but are craving it then wait a little bit for the next step in school and go have some fun while your still young.",

I got so much into my own head that I ended up with an addiction to prostitutes and pain medications and lost my partner of 6 years.  \n\n\nPlease, please, please put your social life before you work life.",

Maybe not an everyday thing, but a once in awhile thing like once a week you maybe go for drinks or hang out? I feel like you could definitely do both your job and your bachelors and have a small social life, and school and work are great places to meet people.",

    "postText": "2023 was supposed to be the year where I get my shit together and improve myself but it feels like I'm still doing the same shit and doing the bare minimum. I can't keep at a goal. For example, I wanted to improve my drawing skill and exercise and get lean daily, and while I'm doing those things, I'm not fully committing to them. It's like I'm half assing them. \n\nI'm still comparing myself to others such as popular streamers and people with motion and feel like I could be living their lives while I'm sitting here being average and feeling less worthy because of it. It goes as far as me thinking I don't deserve a relationship because I'm not in the right place and I have to be this ideal man before dating someone. I mean, I have two jobs, I'm saving enough for a car and possibly community college, I have no criminal record, etc, but overall, I feel like my potential is dwindling.",

            "comment": "You won't get everything right in the first few months of 'getting your shit together'. You compare yourself to others because you blame yourself for not being where you want to be or maybe not working as hard as you want to be now. Fact of the matter is, you started and you are trying. Things won't magically change because you want them to, all you need is discipline and consistency. Breaking out of a routine which you were used to for so long will be difficult to change in just a few months. Bad Habits are hard to get rid of but can be done by being patient with your little progress, allowing room for error and not being to hard on yourself. Discipline takes time to master that's why you must remain consistent in your efforts to improve. Consistency is like currency if you want to improve your life or attain your goals. The more consistent you are the more disciplined you will become and thus you will form new and better habits.\n\nTL/DR Consistency -&gt; Discipline -&gt; Better habits and ultimately better person.",

Remind yourself how far you\u2019ve come and the milestones you\u2019ve passed. If you don\u2019t have an end goal or periodic ones, setting some will be psychologically beneficial. Any task you do every day is going to have good and bad days. Check out the book \u201cGrit,\u201d it talks about how professional athletes get it done even when they have weeks of bad practices.",

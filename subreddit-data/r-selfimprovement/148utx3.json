If you start by doing your best in small ways and treating other people better, and if you stick with it, your self image will change over time. You'll see good results from good actions. You'll see people treat you differently because you're treating them differently. You'll form healthy relationships and benefit from them. It does take time but the only thing you can do is start today, do your best, and do it again tomorrow. Rinse and repeat.\n\nYou can do this, and you're doing the right thing by trying to turn your life around. I wish you all the best.",

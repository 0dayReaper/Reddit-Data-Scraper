    "postText": "Hello guys. So i took a depression test, and the results came with 100% score for depression and a bit lower than 100% for anxiety. \nI am severly depressed. I can\u2019t do any work, i am lazy, tired, bored, when i have many lots of work to do. I just can\u2019t get myself to do it. I can\u2019t control my mind anymore, all i do is what my mind wants. \nI tried some good habits for improving your mental health from the youtuber i watch called Hamza. From him i deleted all social media and started meditating and other good habits. But these don\u2019t seem to work. And now I can\u2019t even do them cause im lazy. I deleted social media but I can\u2019t keep myself off from checking my phone and finding something to do. Deleting social media made me more depressed. Deleting it and meditating of course gave me more focus and success but not control over my brain. My brain is filled with negativity, it always talks bad about me. I have self hate, my self image is trash. I don\u2019t even know what to do. Addicted to p***. My life is fucked up, my brain is fucked up, i feel like i don\u2019t have a brain anymore. Fuck life.",

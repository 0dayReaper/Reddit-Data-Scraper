I am in a phase where I have to get a job and get on my feet, but I think my mindset is ruining things for me.\n\nI recently began to feel a lot of things:\n\n1. That I\u2019m not having any purpose in life. I always think that I need to get a job but I have no idea what to do after getting a job. I am not able to define goals or think about the future. I feel my vision is limited unlike my peers who are doing things the right way.\n\n2. I feel as if my brain is not functioning the way it used to, or slowed down a bit. I feel like I\u2019m taking more time than others to process any new information and I seem to forget things after a while.\n\n3. I am not able to share my opinions on topics. I tend to stay neutral in any discussion or debate with my friends. I feel like I am not knowledgeable on any topic, or I don\u2019t know what to say even if I did know something about it.\n\nI am not sure if this is just me overthinking or if it is some mental condition, but I don\u2019t feel good about it. It seems like the whole world is progressing and moving ahead while I\u2019m still stuck",

They can help via listening to you and identify any mental hang ups or hurdles.\n\n- A popular wisdom is start with getting rid of toxic habits first and focus on that and then slowly work towards positive ones. Our brain is a biological organ it works on chemistry. Our habits and inputs shapes it\u2019s energy levels and desires. Especially with Dopamine rewards and the drive to want to do things. Look up dopamine nation professor lembke on YouTube. Things that can create mental exhaustion, confusion, and lack of drive \u2014- includes excessive Pornography, video games, and media consumption. Constructive things for the minds rewards system and developing more drive includes gut biome diet, sleep, and Exercise. CARDIO and Weightlifting for males is highly beneficial.\n\n- Books like Atomic Habits or Jordan Peterson\u2019s 12 rules may give you some starter points and direction. There are podcasts on YouTube who interview directions in life like Doctor Chatterjee and Jay shetty or healthygamergg.\n\n- A lot of people are lost in life or unhappy with their situation. That\u2019s life it\u2019s very transitory. But you have you take a direction even if you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right one and see what happens. If you\u2019ve never made income. Take small steps to give yourself a foundation. Do Uber/Lyft/Doordash or find odd jobs for weekly income. It gives you a sense of structure. Save that money and invest. It gives you some motivation towards working and the value of money. It can also give you money to travel and experience life as well. Cheap travel.\n\n- It\u2019s good to volunteer and socialize. It may help you get you some insights on life. Put yourself out there.\n\n- Avoid analysis paralysis the best way you can. Whether it\u2019s committing to an online course to study new skills while you figure things out or learning a physical trade via apprentice.",

Yes, I truly believe toxic habits might be a reason and I will have to start working to get rid of them. \n\nI always come across these instagram reels of Jordan Peterson, David goggin etc and I save them to kind of motivate myself, but somehow I\u2019m not able to get them working for me. Not sure what\u2019s wrong.\n\nAnd sorry I forgot to mention, I have been doing an odd job right now working at a theatre where I\u2019m made to do all sorts of crap (it\u2019s kind of toxic there) to cover up my expenses and have some savings. It\u2019s just a part time job I\u2019ve been doing throughout my studies. I now have to find a full time job but I have some skill gap that I need to work on, so I am forced to continue working at this theatre to make a living because the pay is a little better and it is flexible (I define my hours). \n\nAnd there might also be other factors because I spent a very lonely life the past two years where I\u2019ve had very limited interaction with people from my university or strangers. I\u2019ve always wanted to, but I had other priorities every now and then so it never happened. I have to somehow make time for these things.",

                            "comment": "\n\nI think you qualify for low income. Seeing a therapist helps. They remind you of yourself worth and help with ending negative self talk spirals. Self love is pretty important. Being proud of yourself for trying and not giving up in the age of indulgence is a very admirable thing! \n\nLoneliness is hard. I think we all crave friendship or affection. Mental reframing helps if you view life as challenges and you\u2019re in monk mode working on yourself and finding strength in your hardship.\n\nThe brain is a chemical thing. It takes time to rewire from past habits or thought patterns. It doesn\u2019t happen right away but you just need to keep doing good habits until it clicks.\n\nI find listening to kind voices like Michael singer or Alan watts to be peaceful. Sometimes Peterson and goggins to be extreme. They have a place for sure though haha.\n\nKeep up with the exercise, mindfulness, and diet. Change your brain chemistry and thought patterns.\n\nTake road trips out of your area to open your mind to new experiences every now and then.\n\nTry new things. I hate when people tell me this but honestly it helps. New memories help our minds open up to new paths.\n\nSchedule35.co also have psilocybin tea. If that\u2019s something you\u2019re open to investigating.\n\nYou\u2019re actually very young at 25. If you work on a 2 year plan or 5 year plan of studying or apprenticing towards jobs you want to do. You\u2019d get there eventually. \n\nEven 30 is young. So in a way you\u2019re at the right age to work hard for your future and on pace.\n\nYou got this. Remember! Self love and self acceptance. Be proud of your journey and efforts.",

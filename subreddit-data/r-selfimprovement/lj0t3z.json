    "postText": "Self critical thoughts. Guilty thoughts. Thoughts about what I should have done. Fearful thoughts about what others think. \n\nHow dark are the thoughts that follow you around each day? Mine get pretty dark.\n\nThis is haunting if we let ourselves identify with them. We listen to the fears of inadequacy just because they won\u2019t shut up. We believe we really are failures because it\u2019s all we can think about - no matter how much self improvement we read. If it was possible for us to be fixed then why do we still feel so broken?\n\nStop. We are not our thoughts. I need you to see the bigger picture of who you are - not thoughts but actions. I bet you take great care of your pets even when you feel horrible. I bet you have tried self care like yoga and meditation and journaling so you can feel better. I bet you try to help out your friends and family in little ways. Your actions paint a different picture of you than your thoughts. I can\u2019t stop you from judging yourself, but I can ask you to at least consider all the evidence.\n\nI know you feel a lot of pain. I know the thoughts are dark and you wish they would stop. But don\u2019t you dare believe that those thoughts define who you are. You never chose those thoughts. You didn\u2019t ask to feel the pain and negativity. The real you is the one who decided what actions you wanted to take. Do not base your identity and self image on thoughts you don\u2019t even want in your head. Look at the actions you take. Look at the work you put in, especially on the days when you don\u2019t feel like it. That\u2019s who you are. \n\nYou are the captain of a ship in turbulent water. You are steering your life every day in a storm of thoughts that you can\u2019t control. Here\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s not your fault that this storm is here. Don\u2019t hate yourself because the wind is howling and the ship is rocking. You are not the storm, you just need to steer the ship. It\u2019s easy to think that other people share the thoughts you do. That they think about you as negatively as you do, but that\u2019s not true. They don\u2019t see the storm you feel inside, they just see you steering the ship. They see your actions. They see you trying to help others, they see the work you do, the work you put in, the words you say. The actions are who you choose to be, and the version of you that the world sees. Not your thoughts.\n\nMaybe your actions haven\u2019t been what you wanted lately. Mine haven\u2019t either. That\u2019s hard because it can create even more dark thoughts. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t choose different actions today. Your actions today define who you are. Not your actions yesterday, and sure as hell not your negative thoughts. So imagine all your thoughts as waves in the ocean passing through. They come and go, some are painful, but they never last. They are not you. You are not your thoughts. You are your actions, and you can choose your actions.\n\nWho will you choose to be today?\n\n**Further reading:** If this post resonated with you then I highly recommend *Awareness by Anthony de Mello*. When we identify with every thought in our head it\u2019s like walking a tightrope during an earthquake. Negative thoughts pull us in so many directions and life is anything but peaceful or calm. This book is incredible for helping you become aware of your thoughts and step back from the ones that aren\u2019t helpful. His advice helped me catch negative thought loops faster and step out of them. They still come up, but they only get 5 minutes steering the ship before I kick them out, not 5 hours.",

A psychological virus that must be dealt with, and I am the epidemologist.\n\nMy vaccine is: I DON\u2019T CARE ABOUT THEM!\n\nThis actually works and helps a lot to defeat any feelings of low self-esteem, depression, etc.",

That way they don't have to change their way and it's better than being a good person but having awful deeds and behavior, thus avoiding any responsibility for their own action. Having disonance and being a hypocrite hurts more. Similar thing could happen vice versa, where you have good deeds but bad thoughts.",

I miss all the people that have stood beside me and supported me. I miss the beautiful places there like the Performance Art Center, Oak Hall which is on North Campus, South Campus, those places remind me of home. they remind me of a time when things used to be peaceful and everyone can be respectful and get along without being aggressive or violent or hostile towards one another. I just don't want to lose those things that meant so much to me. I want to have a peaceful normal life. I don't want to be living in my parent's basement for the rest of my life. I'm 20 years old I shouldn't be living in my parents basement anymore I should be getting a Job and being in relationships with people outside of my family.",

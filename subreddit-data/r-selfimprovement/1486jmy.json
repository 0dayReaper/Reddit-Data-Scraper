    "postText": "Self improvement is an amazing thing. I have made great improvement and have lifted my friends up to develope themselves as well. The real thing is that I have fallen down again and again and again and again. I have had great streaks, or so I think; maybe only a few weeks at the most. I fall down quick and hit the ground hard every single time. I used to be optimistic whenever I failed self improvement by binging, relapsing into drugs, alcohol, porn/sex and found peace in the idea that I one day will be a man. I am tired. I violently threw up the other night out of axiousness because I started trying again (went back to the gym and started journeling about optimism towards life) this feeling inside me of self doubt and anxiety erupted and I ended up puking all over the gym bathroom floor. Today was my day off of work and I haven't left my room at all. I sit in a room that looks like a bomb went off when it was almost spotless a few days ago. I have been very numb to emotions again after my childhood friend accidentaly overdosed  on something laced with fetenyl and was just pulled off of life support (she was 20 years old). I want to live again but it feels like my flame has been burnt out for a while. Please offer any advice on how I should shake off this shroud I have formed out of trauma from being abused by my mother who attempted to murder me at age 8 and grief of not having a childhood. ",

            "comment": "May not be helpful but self-improvement is not a fun process. It sucks. It involves getting up and getting knocked down. Sometimes several times. I spent 6 years repeating your cycle(I'm 24). Going to the gym, cleaning your room, and eating healthy, at least to me, are just small patches to a much bigger problem. My problem was my motivation. I had nothing really motivating me. Most of my motivations were selfish ones. Money, career, etc. It wasn't until I found someone who was in a worse situation than me that finally motivated me to do better. To help her. Suddenly, my problems were so insignificant. Love motivated me. But not selfish love. Love in helping others. Her effect on me was a snowball effect i had on others. You will begin to love yourself the same way because for once you're finally doing something genuinely good. I had to swallow my pride, and apologize to everyone whom I've hurt even if they didn't accept. I had to start doing stuff for people even if I didn't recieve anything back from them. Because in the end, I always recieved something from myself.",

Perhaps you need some medication to stabilize your mental health/anxiety.\n\nI'm all for non pharmacological interventions like exercise and journaling, but sometimes people need a bit more and that's ok. Sometimes the medication can help you get to the point where you can actually implement the other changes that will improve your life. They can be symbiotic, same with quality therapy and support.\n\nHonestly self help can be a bit toxic sometimes, people hyper obsess that they aren't theses super productive and always positive people 100% of the time. That's not realistic or sustainable. Sadness/anxiety and lack of motivation are normal emotional responses most of the time. \n\nIt's ok to be sad. It's ok to have a messy room sometimes, especially with everything going on in your life. Cut yourself some slack. You have the rest of your life to improve, there is no rush.",

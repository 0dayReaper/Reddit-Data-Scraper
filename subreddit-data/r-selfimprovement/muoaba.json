    "postText": "I heard this quote by Naval Ravikant and it really stuck with me. I have lived by these words the last month and my personal progress has been astonishing. **My mental clarity, energy and confidence have exploded.**\n\n\\- To counteract mental overstimulation, look over your *mental diet*. Minimize screen time and social media and be selective with what you allow into your mind. Take time to reflect, meditate and disconnect from all external input for some time daily.\n\n\\- To counteract physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle, you gotta exercise on a daily basis. Frequency is more important than intensity. Also, do something to maintain a good posture. It's crucial for feeling your best.\n\n\\- To counteract overeating, practice contentment in everything you do. Be selective of what you put into your body. Pursuing pleasure for its own sake destroys motivation, and gathers momentum to pursue comfort. *Fasting* in this case includes abstaining from porn and other type of external pleasure-seeking.",

Your gaze will be aimed slightly downwards. \n\nFeet shoulder width apart, almost parallel but pointing slightly away from each other. \n\nShoulders back, shoulder blades should be flat against the back and at a position where you can squeeze them together. Lift up your heart. \n\nBring your hips forward till about 1/3 of your weight comes onto the balls of your feet and your glutes engage.",

Don't let the fancy word deter you, it's probably the simplest way to get started for a beginner. \n\nYou start with focusing on the area between your nostrils and upper lip. Any sensations you may feel there, or none at all. Try to maintain a good posture, but don't overthink it, whatever is natural for you. You let your breathing happen naturally, don't force it, just notice it. You do your best to keep your attention there and when it inevitably wanders you don't get frustrated with yourself, you just find your way back. Over time you build up a resilience to intrusive thoughts. That's basically it. Over time you move throughout your body, \"body scans\", noticing any sensation here or there. Spend a moment there, observe it, move on. The goal is to just observe them as they rise and fall. It serves as a nice parallel to events in our lives and remembering they come and go. On paper it's stupidly simplistic, but you notice over time how you're able to bring that division of thought into many other aspects of life. Patience, acceptance, non-attachment, clearer decision-making, they all come more naturally.\n\nStart with 15min or whatever works for you where you're at, but work your way up. In my opinion 45-1hr is where it really starts to kick in and everything else just melts away. I've done 10-day silent courses where we meditated on average about 6-8hrs a day..there's a notorious day where you do a 2hr sitting, and I was so into my practice at that point that I remember the gong struck and I was like wait we're done already?? Lolol.\nHope this helps and feel free to ask any other questions about it!",

(Difficult financial situations).\n\nMy lymph node health increased (got clogged, swollen ones), my motivation and happiness was about 10x better than now, no exaggeration. Synchronicities began to happen much more often in my life, my personal psychic awareness was amplified as well as my empathy and effectiveness of everything I did.\n\nIt's a huge contrast, eat those fun colourful lollies of nature for maximum happiness and health! The effects stack up if done consistently. It begins to feel like having a caffeine rush for the first time, everytime but less forced and extra beneficial effects instead of mild side effects.\n\nFRUIT MATTERS! Dont forget the fruit! You and I! It DOES make a BIG difference compared to eating not enough or none!",

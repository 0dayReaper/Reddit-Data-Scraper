    "postText": "I \\[29F\\] just recently removed social media (Instagram, Facebook, dating apps etc) from my life - except Reddit and Youtube as i rarely get on it, even if i do, i mostly read or watch self improvement related.\n\nI have anxiety. But being heartbroken in a months long situationship and my current work stress further exacerbates it which lead me to a psychiatrist last week. I remember while being anxious, i constantly scrolling &amp; stalking on social media for hours thinking it would help rid of my anxious thought, but not knowing doing that actually add more anxiety, stress and pressure mentally that it felt so draining and my mood is at all time low.\n\nThe good thing from removing social media is that in just a week I feel changes such as i'm able to concentrate and focus better, my brain seems to work faster at work - used to feel like i have brain fog, i read more now and able to have longer attention span.\n\nI do not miss social media at all from the first day i removed it but i do feel something is missing or off with my life - something to get used to as i still constantly try to check on my phone out of habit. I also tend to read news on Facebook so i do feel like I'm missing out on stuff especially current news, self-care/improvement post i used to follow on instagram and not knowing whats going on with my friend's life (i don't miss the dopamine hit of likes/post as i don't post).\n\nJust wanting to understand from others on how long it takes for you to get used to it?",

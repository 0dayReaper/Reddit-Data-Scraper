I am surrounded by the constant \"what ifs\" and the like when it has been proven to me time and time again that it isn't as hard as I thought it would. I hope I can overcome this and do things up to the best of my ability and knowledge.",

            "comment": "It can. One interesting thing I\u2019ve notice is externalizing the though and making it about a proxy can instantly show us the error. \n\nIf you can\u2019t say it to someone else even if they have the same scents then it\u2019s not right to say it to yourself. If your friend made the same mistake you did and there\u2019s a discrepancy in the response then that has to be noted. \n\nMost feelings come from the judgments we make about how things \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d be and as those change so does how we feel. \n\nOur mind is logical, it makes sense internally to us, but that logic is often not reasonable (reflecting reality). \n\nI\u2019ll add that, if you\u2019re ever in a though spot remember that you didn\u2019t know any better. If you did know you would have done it and even if you \u201ccould have\u201d picked that choice, you rejected it for a reason your thought was good at the time. In reality this logic is like a kid who gets the multiple choice question wrong and then shouts they knew the answer. You only recognize the answer after you made the mistake because you didn\u2019t know why the answer was right, you just recognize it was an option. These \u201cmistakes\u201d we harp on we fundamentally see as making the problem instead of what they actually are, helping correct an underlying mistake that was always present.",

    "postText": "I was reading a question on Quora about people reminiscing on their first loves, people in their 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s who thought of their first loves from decades ago,which made me ask this question. I haven\u2019t had a first love. The last time I had a crush in high school, the feeling wasn\u2019t mutual and I was severely depressed and suicidal for years. That reaction was the result of several previous rejections and I haven\u2019t loved as deeply since.\n\nThat indescribable feeling of admiration for someone else, that sense of young dumb love, is it possible to still have that at a later age? I feel like the \u201cmagic has worn off\u201d, in a sense. That I missed the boat and can never experience that.\n\nIt feels like it doesn\u2019t matter how handsome I am, how muscular I am, or that I\u2019m a kind considerate person, none of that matters. Not for me. Why bother trying to love if I\u2019m constantly rejected? I\u2019d love to open my heart and love someone, but if they can never feel the same way about me why bother trying?",

What I know for sure though, is I made a lot of mistakes with my early relationships (because I was young and had lower emotional intelligence at that time), so my current husband has a better partner in me than anyone I\u2019ve ever been with.\n\nHe\u2019s the beneficiary of all the hard lessons I learned when I was younger.",

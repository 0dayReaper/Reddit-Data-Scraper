    "postText": "I (25M) came from a very toxic relationship. My ex did the \"quiet quitting\" on me and I held on for 3 years making it so traumatic for me. \n\nRecently, I am dating this girl (32F) and it's all really good. However, there are still things that triggers my trauma like her not responding thru text, assuming the worst, and always thinking I did something wrong although in reality I haven't (These are the common things I have encountered with ny ex). \n\nI am pretty much aware that this is my anxiety talking and I'm really striving to be better at this. Please give me some guidance\n\n\nTLDR: I'm having relationship anxiety with my current SO although things are really good and healthy. Please help me overcome this so I could be better.",

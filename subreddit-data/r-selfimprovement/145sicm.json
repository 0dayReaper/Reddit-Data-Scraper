    "postText": "I dont want to die over addiction like my friend last year. And thats the way.. At least for me. I cant imagine continue gambling on this level and dont think about death daily.\n\nMy situation isnt that bad(yet), but lack of 2000z\u0142 for now(need for loan and rent) is haunting me and thats why im in full gambling mode.. Probably i will lose it all. Then i will be suicidal and depressed much more.\n\nI watch porn as well. Its still \u201ehealthy\u201d amount but i feel like its just feeding my tiktok brain with a dopamine. I have too much of it in myself.\n\nIm just done. I dont want to be sad human being with struggles who killed himself over addiction.",

You've already admitted that you'll lose it if you keep going. You just have to truly understand where your path is headed and decide not to go down that path. No one can make that choice for you. Try a different route. Spend your time making honest money.",

Quit the mentioned activities and replace them with a more productive habit.\n\n1)Convert Porn into working out and exercise\n2)Convert Gambling into buying things you like or gifts for others. This is a better return on your investment\n3)Instead of scrolling social media, write down goals that you wish to achieve and research different activities that you can do with your time, whether it's going to see a family member or friend in person. The trick is to not be throwing away your energy into the abyss. Hope this helps :)",

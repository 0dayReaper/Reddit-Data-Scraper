    "postText": "recently turned 20 and decided i wanted more for my life, kinda stayed a loser in high school and my first semesters in college. i\u2019ve been in a rut as of late, i\u2019ve been grinding out a summer semester and working out but i don\u2019t feel like i\u2019m going anywhere or living a fulfilling life. i barely have any friends or a social life and i don\u2019t get out at all besides work. i don\u2019t have much experience in the dating scene either. i don\u2019t think i\u2019m working hard enough because i still feel like i still make too many negative decisions and don\u2019t have enough consistency in my life. i understand it\u2019s a marathon and every day you can do a little better to reach your goals but sometimes it\u2019s hard. what can i do about this?",

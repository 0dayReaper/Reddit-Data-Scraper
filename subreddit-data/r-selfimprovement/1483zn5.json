    "postText": "It was an actual fight. It was brutal, violent and went on longer than I thought it would. I didn't expect to post this but I learned something from this fight. Something important. \r  \n\r  \nSo I had been waiting for a friend at the edge of town after a meeting with a prospective client. It wasn\u2019t a bad part of town. A guy just approached me and it was just a wrong time, wrong place type deal and I was all cashed in. But I just wasn\u2019t going to get robbed. I know how dangerous a stance that is. But some stances you need to take. The stuff I have on me weren't insured and I have so many templates that are offline that my livelihood would've been in danger \rif I didn't fight for myself.\r  \nI haven\u2019t fought since high school. I couldn\u2019t be ready for this but I had to bet on myself. It\u2019s all any of us can do. I realised I hadn\u2019t been doing that for a while. I haven\u2019t been in a situation I was uncomfortable with and I hadn\u2019t taken a risk where failure was solely because of my ability. \r  \n\r  \nI HANDILY won that fight and to get to the point of this post. I haven\u2019t been taking enough fights. (I don\u2019t mean I\u2019ll be dressed like a bat in the night from now on. NO.) I mean in my career and life in general. But I\u2019ll be taking more risks from now on. I won't be ready for it because the best chance I'll ever have is right now when I don't have much to lose. If this post gets positive feedback I'll share my journey. I'm doing 100k in one hundred days and currently trying to get a marketing deal with netflix on the backend as well.",

I reached a point where I started winning most if not all of them, and that gave me a lot of confidence to act foolishly. Not act like a bully myself, having been through that I'd never do it to someone else, but I definitely go along with more risk taking behaviors when it comes to fights.\n\nIt's a good space to be in mentally but a terrible place to be in physically. It only takes one bullet, one knife stab, or even one knockout on concrete to be placed 6 ft under. \n\nLike I said, I'm working on this problem too, just be careful and most importantly be humble and learn to let things go.",

Looking rough and he asked for my phone then he asked for my bag when I said no and put the phone in my pocket. Now he quickly got hostile. He said some shit and started immediately getting uncomfortably close. I step back. Thinking if I could get back to the cafe I was at. But I believe I can take him. He didn't have a knife or anything so it'd be a man-to-man fight. So I tell tell him to ease up and he just starts going off so I'm there standing firm. Telling him he can fk off then he lunged and I had a bag on so I wasn't moving at the optimum speed. He got me and that's when I popped off. I was nice with it. I'm hitting him with these long bombs. These quick jabs. these one, twos. The mistake he made was after he threw he stepped back and I went in. The whole thing probably took a minute before he fell down. I busted his s\\*t wide open, he quickly stood up and ran",

I also went and ate breakfast and had coffee when I was thinking about doing more\u2026..  I\u2019m probably gonna be using for a while but I figure there are a few people I know who lead successful lives while using this shit and a big difference is they still eat and sleep and  take care of their hygiene. I\u2019ve lost around 15lbs, All muscle as I was already sub 10% bf so I guess it makes sense I\u2019ve lost so much strength. I\u2019m gonna be eating and sleeping twice as hard now to make up for the time I tweak\u2026. I know that sounds  dumb but makes sense as even when I drank but wasn\u2019t tweaking, I never used ate, slept, worked out kind of sporadically\u2026.

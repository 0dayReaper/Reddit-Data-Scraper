    "postText": "Hello all! Over the past few months, I\u2019ve slowly been able to improve my mental health and escape depression (for the most part). I\u2019m now trying to take small steps to improve my life. I\u2019m curious if any of you have a habit tracking app you could recommend (iOS)? Preferably a free one, or something relatively low cost. I think working on implementing various habits in my daily routine could help my mental health as well. Thank you all in advance!",

It's free, portable (I can access it on my laptop and phone) and you can customise it endlessly as well as making updates to the look, feel and layout as you test and learn.\n\nMine started off as just as a single sheet with a column for days and row headers for habits with a simple yes/no if I'd done the habit I was tracking.\nIt's evolved into something far more complex with summarys, graphs, formulas, conditional formatting etc.\nI would recommend you try taking a similar route.",

            "comment": "I highly recommend the forfeit app as a motivational app. The premise of the app is basically sending an evidence completing a task, or you lose money. There\u00b4s no subscription, so you only spend money in case you don\u00b4t send the evidence completing the task. Try to set all your daily tasks on the app, and then send an evidence completing each one of them, bet like $2 or $3 for each and you\u00b4re good to go.",

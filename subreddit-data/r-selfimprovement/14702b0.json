    "postText": "\r  \nHello!\r  \n\r  \nI'm on my holidays right now and I don't really have anything to do. And I just turned 18. I've been very lazy in the last few days just using my phone all the time. I want to do something productive and work on myself. I think I've lost control over my myself, for example I can't stop scrolling my phone even if I want to, because I'm addicted to it. I would like to get out of my comfort zone and learn new skills that can be helpful to me. How do I stop myself from using my phone so much? I'd like to learn some self discipline too.\r  \n\r  \nI would appreciate tips for self improvement.\r  \n\r  \nAlso, what are the skills that I can learn which will be really useful to me? (Please include where I can learn them from)\r  \n\r  \nThanks in advance.",

To reduce phone usage, try setting daily limits and using apps that track your screen time, like Moment or Forest. As for self-improvement, focus on activities that interest you. Learn new skills by checking out platforms like Skillshare or YouTube tutorials. And here's a cool app you can try called Forfeit. You set tasks and if you don't complete them, you lose some money. It adds a bit of motivation to stick to your goals. Give it a shot and see if it works for you! Good luck on your journey of self-improvement!",

    "postText": "I used to think that if I was a good person, things should work out for me. I spent a lot of times doing things that were \u201cgood\u201d. I put others over myself and thought that meant good things would happen to me, and well, that didn\u2019t work out as I had expected. I did everything I was supposed to do and ended up sick, tired, and miserable because my underlying beliefs were that I needed to do / be something other than what I was in order to be worthy. \n\nI used to be a perfectionist. I used to be so tough on myself. I never believed I was worthy of good things. My outer life reflected that. I was addicted to adderall, nicotine, anorexic or stuck in disordered eating, over-caffeinated, sleep-deprived, constantly in toxic relationships, and in crippling debt. I thought poorly of myself based on old stories I clung onto. \n\nI\u2019ve healed so much over the last few years but recently I realized that I never stopped to look around to where it got me. I never basked in the glory of this moment. And I still felt badly about myself. \n\nI decided to learn different healing modalities and just tune into myself daily. Instead of thinking of it as work, or something to change, I now know it\u2019s something to do to understand my own beautiful uniqueness and capabilities. \n\nA few weeks ago I had a huge shift. I know it\u2019s because of all of the things I\u2019ve done over the last few years, and because I\u2019ve finally accepted the fact that I am worthy and fully believe it. That feeling hasn\u2019t wavered for weeks, and I don\u2019t see it happening but maybe it will. I have tools to help. \n\nMy life today is beautiful and I feel very grateful. I\u2019ve got everything I need and many things I want. I have a stable job, many things I\u2019m passionate about, and am building a business in addition to my full-time job. \n\nTwo days ago, I had made a mistake. A simple one, but historically, no matter the size of the error, it would send me into a spiral: \u201cI\u2019m an idiot!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d And ruin my whole day about it. But two days ago, I literally sang, as if I was a kid, \u201cI made a mistake, and that\u2019s OK! Everyone makes mistakes!\u201d Immediately after, I smiled so big because that was showing something deep down inside of me has shifted immensely. \n\nI just received some praise at work yesterday and I was fully open and knew I was deserving of it. It was a big moment as many important people were there to hear it, and I was singled out by name. I didn\u2019t shy away or downplay it, I said thank you, proudly!\n\nThings are falling together because I finally know that I am worthy. \n\nI just wanted to let you know that really wonderful things can happen once you focus your energy on you. We can\u2019t change what we did in the past. I spent so much years in shame over things I did when I didn\u2019t know better. Beating yourself up today does nothing but ruin this moment. \n\nI wanted to share some affirmations as a practice if anyone is interested. They have really helped me on my journey. \n\nI am worthy.  \nMy past doesn\u2019t define me.  \nEvery day I can choose a different way of showing up.  \nI deserve the life I want.  \n\n_\nTL;DR\n\naffirmations:  \n\nI am worthy.  \nMy past doesn\u2019t define me.  \nEvery day I can choose a different way of showing up.  \nI deserve the life I want.\n\nEdit:\nThank you all for the support. I\u2019m so glad so many of you resonate. I have a podcast called Everyday Perspectives where I unpack topics like this, shifting mindset from victim to co-creator with life. It\u2019s available on all major podcast platforms if you\u2019re interested &lt;3",

I am being honest of course but certain narcissists in my life like to play the victim game and not take responsibility. So I am trying to figure out how to promote it.  Any suggestions would be appreciated. I literally grew up pooping in a bucket to now living in a 2200 square foot house ( not that size matters compared to a persons humanity). I married my high school sweetheart ( that I still like ) and have 2 boys that are nice people.  I seriously changed my life path. I appreciate your kind words .",

            "comment": "It has been a few years since I had come out of that hole I unfortunately fell into. No longer can I keep masking my emotions. I now speak the truth and it frees me up to be who I really am, nurture my child with honesty. Furthermore, as more love floods into my life I feel things like joy, peace, and generosity are emerging as new ways of seeing in the world. I don\u2019t need to control everything. What I desperately needed was to shed the heaviness, the self-disapproval, the shame I used to beat myself into a prolonged coma. I don\u2019t keep paging through my old journals again and again wondering what the story was from the beginning, looking for nail-marks and reading my own horrid thoughts of how it should be. I no longer hide behind the fear and the illusions and the lower-grade mental illnesses: fear of commitment, fear of success, fear of being seen and the terror of your own power and control. Today's heart felt experience is we are all worthy of love, even though there are so many who feel unworthy. Instead of wasting time on how they should be different than they are, or how they should get help, I invite you to look deeply at the parts of you that feels this way. What do you believe about yourself? Playfully ask others what they believe about you. I know that at different times, different things will come up for different people. For some it will be happiness, for others, even depression. Nonetheless, stop and listen. gifts such as love are endless and priceless and can come from their magic. Isn't it time we stopped condemning ourselves? This isn\u2019t about fixing or changing ourselves. This is about allowing ourselves to come to the realization that we arrived at this point in life without all of those nasty things. Some of us took many years to arrive here. Others, unfortunately took just one momentary act, before they crashed in the abyss of self-hatred. The key is to recall moments of self-worth, moments of lights-in, light out moments of feeling safe and secure. Do you feel you don\u2019t deserve any joy because of the past? Has your history been so tough on your discouragement, simple as uncomfortable or ugly? Are you imprisoned by the need to maintain that image of yourself? As you sincerely ask for help, be kind with yourself. Come out of denial and help someone. It is a given possibility that you are disguised as a victim in times of challenge. Even the self-assured, powerful and good people can have a tendency to overlook their own strength, capabilities and inner worth. This is because of the pressure to take care of others, no matter the sacrifice. But you are not and now you understand that you are worthy of anything good, large or small. You can walk out of that shadow and finally be free to be the human you were meant to be. Finding your own way will allow your joy and appreciation to return in ways that you were not able to do before. Remember that you are worthy of love and that unconditional acceptance. You also deserve to be happy. You can walk out of that shadow and get rid of the eyesore of hopelessness and insecurity.",

I made 100k on the GME fiasco a few weeks ago but I did not sell my shares (they were not allowing you to buy back in so I just hung on) - and now I'm wondering if that was a symptom of feeling unworthy that caused me not to hit the sell button... But on the other hand the reason I didn't is because I thought/knew it was going to go higher, and it would have if not for the meddling by the brokers.\n\nAs someone who's gone through a similar journey as me in the past 3 years I'm interested to hear your thoughts.",

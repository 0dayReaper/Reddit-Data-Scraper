We had ups and downs but always thought of us as permanent match because we kept coming back to each other.\nI had some mental issues going on from the past few days where i suffered from anxiousness and panic attacks, those led me to believe he didnt love me anymore and so i decided to cheat on him. \nBut he found out that i cheated and gave me a second chance. I cheated again...\nNow he broke up with me and told me to die. And called me a lot of names . \n\nThe thing is.. i feel like my whole world is crumbling. I love him. More than anything. I desperately want him back. But know that theres no other ways left. \n\nI stopped eating or sleeping or showering. Im just crying all the time and not even attending classes. Its messed up. And he told me to die... Its the only thing playing on my head.",

That said, you aren\u2019t irredeemable, and you don\u2019t deserve to die. Accept  the consequences of your actions and get some therapy. Learn why you felt the need to do what you did, how to recognize those impulses and improve upon that.",

I think what you did is terrible and it goes beyond just hurting someone. You traumatized someone and betrayed the good parts of them. It\u2019s highly serious. However, you obviously have a level of guilt and you\u2019re literally being open about everything on a self-improvement sub. It may be best for your relationship to end and if your partner decides to end things you have no basis to begrudge them for that. That\u2019s not in your control. What is in your control is being completely transparent with yourself that you did something awful, and working honestly to cleanse this out of your character. Beyond the moral aspect of this situation, you also betrayed yourself. You chose meaningless pleasure over what is meaningful. Develop self-control. You\u2019re not too far gone and I don\u2019t stand with anyone who acts as if there\u2019s nothing you can do to transform into someone who would never cheat again. You have lots of work to do but the silver lining, and the only silver lining is that you are still a person who can grow from doing the work.",

This environment will confirm you should feel disgusted, since what you did is very traumatic for people on the receiving end of that. Once is one too many times for most of us, so twice is like huge, I'm sure you get the idea.\n\nAs someone who used to deal with pretty severe anxiety, severe panic attacks, stress, etc.. I do kind of feel bad reading that part, not that it excuses anything you're clearly guilty of doing, but anyone who has gone through that knows the terror and horror of reality turning into one of your worst nightmares. -I can give you the good news, panic attacks and anxiety are behavioral, that means somewhere down the road, for whatever reason, trauma, stress, etc, a hiccup in our learning made the brain behave that way for whichever reason(s) that tend to trigger that response. You have to unlearn that. Breathing, meditation, plenty of sleep, nutrition, exercise, and possibly the most important one - change your outlook, whatever change needs to be made in which ever areas that currently make your mind go haywire into panic attack mode. Do these things, they can and will heal this, but not overnight. Don't think of it as a giant list of crap you gotta do, just make little improvements here and there, and eventually you can kick the panic attacks and anxiety.\n\nAs for cheating on your bf, sorry, but I can't help you there, that's where you're S.O.L -",

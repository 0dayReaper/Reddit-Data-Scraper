    "postText": "\n\nI recently finally got a stable job but the hours are brutal. Some days I gotta wake up between 2-3:00 am and get home as late as 19:00. \nI've worked a job before for almost 3 years where I had to wakeup for 4/4:30 am (and that was somewhat manageable) so this is nothing new to me, but I remember I still hated it. Now it's whole new level..\n\nNowadays I feel like a zombie all day after about  as early as 8/900 am and afternoons I'm just unable to function at all and take frequent naps .\nSome days my head feels like it's vibrating or something all day and it's annoying it has to be related to my constant state of almost sleep deprivation. \n\n\nMy only salvation is weekends where I try to sleep in and regain some of it but obviously vI can't fix all work week worth off no sleep, and everyone else expects me to function and attend weekend activities (that sometimes start early morning)as usual...\n\nI try to go to bed after 6/7/8 pm but if I take a nap in the afternoon (which I maybe shouldn't but I feel like I have to or else I die some days it's that bad)I can't fall asleep again that early. \nI'm on all the major self improvement stuff also to  various degree but I think even if my diet exercise and everything else was absolutely on point it wouldn't make up for it much.also being constantly so sleep deprived makes it hard to be motivated or have energy for exercise etc.\n\nAny advice ? I'm feeling like shit and rethinking staying at this job, I'm not really a morning person at all even though I tried to make it work for years now..\n\n\nBtw I realize the obvious answer here is \"just go to sleep early bro, get more sleep \" but I just can't seem to be able to consistently fall asleep so early when I should to get 7+ hrs and my afternoon naps screw it up even more and as bad as I realize they are I can't just seem to resist it and always lie down for a bit every day...",

            "comment": "No, the obvious answer is to find a less destructive job. I'm not really sure how many hours you work on average per day, since all you've said is that your working hours are all over the place. And that sometimes you get up 2 or 3am and only come home at 7 in the evening. That's what, 15 or 16 hours of work in a day? That is not sustainable. Of course you'll be dead tired after such a long day, and you don't even get any time to relax and recover. Barely enough time to sleep, if you do nothing else.\n\nI assume that you're not always working 16 hour days but even if it's something like 12 hours usually, it should be clear to anyone that this is not sustainable. That kind of workload will grind you down and the issues you're facing now will only keep getting worse with time. You can't make up for lack of sleep during the week on weekends. That just doesn't work. Your body will try to make up for it by making you sleep in on weekends but it can't cover what you're missing out on during the week. And it sure isn't healthy.",

But if having to get up at unnatural times is your issue, I don't know of a solution to that. Especially if you have to get up at different times each day that will really mess with your circadian rhythm. And for me, even getting up each day at the same early hour, something like 6am already messes me up. Which is why I'm currently working a part time job with working hours from afternoon to evening.\n\nMost people seem to deal with this by drinking coffee all day. Which is not a healthy solution. Are you drinking any and it still doesn't help? If so then you really have no other option but to find another job with better work hours. At least I don't know of any other way. Getting up too early turns me into a zombie and then I'm dead tired  all day long, even if I've slept 9 or more hours and have woken up without an alarm due to being used to the same wake time each day.",

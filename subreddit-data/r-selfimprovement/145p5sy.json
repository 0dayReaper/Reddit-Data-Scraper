Anyways I gained a lot of lbs over exactly 6 months but the thing is my body is still skinny. My body still looks the same after the weight. NOT my face. I\u2019m 5\u201d8 &amp; 145 lbs. I need a serious routine to get this jawline back it\u2019s holding me back. ( if you want a pic for reference go to my recent post) *edit* - not sure if this is the correct sub for a kind of post if you have any recommendations as to where to post let me know*",

You likely do have fat and muscle gained elsewhere that just aren\u2019t as visible as they are in your face. You notice changes to your face more than your body.",

If you don\u2019t want to lose muscle you will need to focus on consistent exercise and protein intake during this time. As for how much weight you need to lose, I can\u2019t tell you because everyone is different. I\u2019d suggest setting a smaller goal like losing 5lbs and then if you aren\u2019t satisfied, lose another 5 etc. the important thing is you don\u2019t want to go too extreme to where your calorie intake is too low, because then you will start seeing your muscle and strength drop badly (happened to me, recovered fairly quickly by eating more and training harder, but it still sucks when you feel yourself getting weaker.)",

    "postText": "I've been struggling with addiction to popular apps like Instagram and Snapchat. Recently, I made the decision to uninstall all of them in an attempt to break free from my phone addiction. However, I've realized that I've simply replaced them with YouTube. I find myself endlessly scrolling through YouTube shorts, which is not the progress I was hoping for. Now, I'm contemplating removing YouTube as well.\n\nI wanted to reach out to the community and ask for your suggestions. What other apps have helped you when you decided to uninstall all the dopamine-inducing apps from your phone? I'm open to any ideas and recommendations that have been effective in your own journey to overcome phone addiction. Let's support each other in this process.",

So i found doing this better than deleting my social medias, and definitely better than the IOS blocker, cause i was always \"ignoring\" it.",

    "postText": "M27 here. I've been unemployed for a while, I'm applying for jobs in IT. In startups and LinkedIn everywhere I see I feel like world is just going too fast. AI this and AI that, There's just not anything natural and easy like before. I fear too much competition and starting to question my abilities like am I even able to do anything? Everyone seems so smart and capable even people younger than me are getting six figure jobs and I just feel like I'm missing out a lot in life. I've been very persistent but lately I'm losing hope.\r  \n\r  \nI tend to find comfort in watching old nostalgic movies and old shows because there I feel like escaping from this fast modern trends\r  \n\r  \nI feel like just going somewhere quite near lake with small house and live out of all this noise.\r  \nI did started doing mindful meditation practices but still not much helpful.\r  \n\r  \nAny suggestions or thoughts on this?\r  \n\r  \nThanks in Advance :)",

But I don\u2019t think you want it enough and the hell if I care:\n\nYou can derive meaning by finding a way to be compassionate, or becoming a bird landlord and feeding them, providing drink, and shelter.\n\nYou can derive meaning by working at homeless shelters, soup kitchens, and working with individuals one by one, playing some sort of role in helping them achieve their goals.",

Do something that brings you joy. Do what you can and know that is enough. Slow down. Exercise if you can, but don\u2019t be too hard on yourself if that\u2019s too much. Get outside, but don\u2019t be too hard on yourself if that\u2019s too much. Drink water. Soak in the shower. Eat what you want to eat. Fill your body with nutrients too. Let go of guilt. Let go of the pressure you put on yourself to be okay all of the time. Give yourself love. Nurture yourself.",

I forgive them\u2026 because forgiveness is for me, not for them. So they have my forgiveness, but they don\u2019t have my trust. And I don\u2019t talk to people I don\u2019t trust.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone. Don\u2019t give up. You took the first and biggest step by cutting off toxic people. Keep going.

When I did this,  I created a vision, of what I wanted to do with my life, broke it down to small achievable tasks, and filled my life with lots of meaningful things to do, so i spent time doing stuff mostly all the time. It's amazing how an ideal image and work can make one feel brighter and better!! When I got better, I patched up with my family keeping a safe distance but connected....  on my terms.

Or happiness for that matter. Emotions are fleeting, and they do not represent who you are at your core.\n\nWhat helps me when I\u2019m feeling overwhelming despair is listing 5 things I\u2019m grateful in that moment. It can be things like my children or my health or a rainbow, but sometimes I\u2019m just thankful to sincerely feel gratitude. It\u2019s a skill some never learn. \n\nI also learned external means of relief aren\u2019t sustainable. You can\u2019t depend on anything or anyone to fill that void. It has to come from within. Don\u2019t distract yourself from the pain. Let yourself feel it, accept that your feelings are valid and try to let it go. It\u2019s a process and therapy has helped me greatly.\n\nI know it hurts.

I know things can get really bad and you might feel like there's no point in living, but never let external factors take control of how you feel about yourself. \n\nYou are your own being and feeling good about yourself irrespective of the circumstances is the way forward. It's hard, really hard. But that's the point of life. Life has always been a struggle and we have to sail through it no matter how terrible it becomes. Our problems are not going to be there forever, even if they are, it's only going to indicate that we were strong enough to have experienced it and survived. \n\nI request you to reach out to help, wherever you are. Trust me, there are people out there who care about you, who love you. All you need to do is reach out to them. Here\u2019s a hotline that can help: 1-800-273-8255. \n\nNow, I am reaching out to you. DM me if you need any support. Also, there's nothing more fun than beating our demons, be it internal or external. Take care. \u2764",

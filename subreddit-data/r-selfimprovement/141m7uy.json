    "postText": "I, I'm 18 years old and since few mounth I pronounce her name in my head everyday.\n\nIt's the first time I post something on Reddit and I thought it would help me.\n\nAlthough I tried to move on, it's different when I see her in my class. Like if all the previous effort disappered.\n\nI tried to make contact with her but despites some short interaction, I can't go further maybe because of my lack of experience. I only managed to follow her Instagram.\n\nAs time pass, I realised that it degraded myself. My priorities changed and I slowly forgot the essential in my life. Even if I kept good ties with my family.\n\nI felt very lonely during a period, since I workout almost everyday and try to focus on my person.\nI developped the necessity to show the \"sigma\" facade of me, that's maybe the reason I'm alone. But behind this facade, I'm lost.\n\nI'm tired of being in this Infinite loop and want to be like before. How can I start ?\n\nThanks for reading.",

And no matter how amazing she seems, she's just a regular person, not one to be put on a pedestal. It's up to you to realise that before moving on. But the best thing you can do is try talking to her, flirting with her and ultimately asking her out.\n\nHeck, you can skip the flirting phase, but if she rejects or accepts then moving on will become much easier.",

There are so many things I wanna do but I feel like I'm just not *there* yet.\n\nI have mixed feelings about it. In a way, I feel like I really need to disconnect from the world and reach that specific place I have in mind. I have a few things that require my direct attention, and I don't want to have any outside events obscure that.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not sure if that goal is actually real. I might think to myself \"I need 5 more months\", and after those 5 months pass, I might say \" I need 5 more months\" and the cycle continues.",

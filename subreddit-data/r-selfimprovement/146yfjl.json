That\u2019s a contribution.\n\nHave you ever met someone or seen videos of people so sweet and kind to the point it makes you love others? That\u2019s a contribution. Imagine the things you\u2019d do to keep a person like that in your life. \n\nYou don\u2019t really have to do anything, you just have to be. \n\nI guess my last analogy is giving your best is like being robbed, you can only give the money you have, if that\u2019s a dollar then that\u2019s all you can give. If the robber demands for more that\u2019s their issue. \n\nYou also get better at stuff over time. It be really weird if you were as good as you\u2019d ever be the first day. If you\u2019re not looking for ways to learn then you might look. \n\nEmployment isn\u2019t your worth as a human being. Look at your loved ones, would you hold them to the standard you do yourself? If not then imagine you\u2019re talking to them instead.",

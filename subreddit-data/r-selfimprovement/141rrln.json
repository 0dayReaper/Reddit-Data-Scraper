    "postText": "I 20f have a lot of things I regret. I didn't pick up any hobbies until recently, one of them being the guitar, and I feel guilt over not starting them sooner. I tell myself I would've been so much better by now if I had started sooner, and by the time I get decent I'll be old and it wouldn't be as \"impressive\" anymore. And that'd I'll never be as good as someone who started at an earlier age, and that it's silly to try now and I should be focusing on adult things. I know I shouldn't worry about impressing people and I genuinely like these hobbies but I still can't shake these thoughts out.",

I struggled for the first year but kept working on the chords, strumming and then it just clicked. Good luck with the journey and start playing with other people as you get better.",

I\u2019m in my 30s and only recently got my shit together and I still have so much time ahead of me!",

If you regret not starting when you were younger, then the answer is starting now to prevent your future self from regretting. You can only control the present, and wallowing in your past regret will not serve you.",

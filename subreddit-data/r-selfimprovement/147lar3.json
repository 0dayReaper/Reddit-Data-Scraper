    "postText": "In medicine in my country, passing into 2nd year depends on your rank (only top 150 are allowed) and you can redo the year only once (usually around 50). Last year I had undiagnosed ADHD which finally hit like a ton of bricks so I had to stop with a doctor's note. I got it treated, came back this year with a way to finally manage it after 20 years and did my exam, only to fall into the redo-er category. I was only 5 points out of 260 away from passing. \n\nI now have to deal with my own personal failure plus my parents constantly reminding me of it and constant passive agressive comments. How do I deal with this ? I have lost another year of my life. How can I personally move on? How do I shake off the comments ?",

You were very close and should be able to pass next time, so don't be so hard on yourself!\n\nI wouldn't think of it as a waste of a year of your life, it sounds like you've done well to get to where you are, and 10 years from now you'll look back on it as a small blip. Think of how proud of yourself you'll be for persevering and passing the second time.\n\nThere's nothing you can do now to change the fact you failed the first time. The only thing you can do now is get your head down and make sure you pass it next time.",

I somehow got it treated and was able to contend but I still feel like I could've done more. I had slip ups and my motivation was shoddy at best and even though I worked consistently my efficiency fell. \n\nI have to constantly hear about how I failed now from family.",

But I wouldn't class this as a significant failure, a lot of people aren't where you're at at your point in life, and a 1 year blip doesn't change where you'll be in the future.\n\nI don't know your family dynamic, but maybe tell them how you feel when they keep bringing it up? If that won't help, then the only thing you can do is try to pass next time and then they won't have anything to complain about!",

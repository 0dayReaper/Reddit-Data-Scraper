    "postText": "As mentioned, rather than posting the results, I figured I would post the prompts and let you all decided which you would like to follow up if any.  Also happy to answer any questions.\n\n\\- What is the most complete way to live, giving advice on diet, exercise and mental health regime for a healthy life?\n\n\\- Can you give me a weekly diet plan with recipes for each of the diet dot points\n\n\\- For the exercise can you give me a daily workout routine involving only dumbbells (currently using only home gym, hence dumbbells)\n\n\\- For the mental health routine can you give me a daily routine?\n\n\\- Can you create a calendar that incorporates all of the exercise and mental health routines?\n\n\\- For the diet plan can you create a monthly diet routine without repeating meals more than once in three days. \n\n\\- Can you create a weekly shopping list off of this diet plan?\n\n\\- Can you provide the recipes for the monthly diet routine?\n\n\\- If I was to follow this full routine of exercise, diet and mental health practices, is there other things you would suggest to improve my life?\n\n\\- I wake at 6am and leave for work at 7:45am can you give me a schedule for the morning routine that includes the mental health and wellness routines as well as breakfast and shower?\n\n\\- I get home at 7pm can you put together a nightly schedule that includes my fitness routine and dinner and mental health routine?\n\n\\- Can you provide the recipes for the monthly diet routine?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese prompts provided me with, a healthy unique diet with recipes and shopping list, a broken down morning and evening schedule for mental and physical health, there were further prompts based off of these initial ones, that went more in depth into things, but these gave a great base and to be provided what would take me ages to look up and put together in a matter of minutes was amazing.",

It essentially reads the internet and compiles things from it. It might have great advice and work for you, in the same way that googling those questions might result in great suggestions, or might lead you down an MLM rabbit hole.",

Those that offer \"exercise\" advice, may not include a \"diet\", or a \"mental health\" regime and vice versa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also think plagiarism, is the attempt of passing ones work off as your own, where this is literally a machine telling you exactly what it does... reads the internet to give you the advice based off of other peoples information.",

I like chatting with it, and use it to rewrite emails for politeness. \n\nI just worry about the idea of people taking it.. or really any advice on the internet too seriously.\n\nHeck, most diet and weight loss advice is garbage and science is showing us more and more that even very canonical knowledge in those areas doesn't actually work for a majority of people especially the people most likely to seek out that advice. \n\nThen again I answer questions on here which pretty regularly require a simple Google search. I don't know if I'm just better at searching in the fields I'm familiar with, or if people just want to be spoon fed information and can't be bothered to look themselves.",

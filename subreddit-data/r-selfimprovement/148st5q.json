    "postText": "I just got out of a relationship where my partner relied on me as one of his only sources of support. It was emotionally exhausting and I'm feeling hopeless about the future. When I make plans to go out and do something like hiking or hanging out with friends, I bail last minute because it feels too overwhelming and I'm too tired. I get angry at myself because I want to do these things, but I wonder if that's only because it's what's \"healthy\" and \"expected of me.\" Is it so wrong to just sit in bed and watch tv/read/work on personal projects once I get home from work? Or should I push past my fatigue (whether it's real/imagined/physical/emotional) and just do the things?",

            "comment": "No, it's' not wrong to value your alone time and recharge through solitary activity. I am very similar. It's also incredibly exhausting to be the only source of support for a partner, as you describe, and you might need some time to re-center after that.\n\nThe main thing I'd keep an eye on is your closeness with people you care about. It does take time together to maintain friendships and there's a very very long list of people who lost friendships because they never made time to get together. You won't be at risk of that for a while and I think you should focus on recharging and enjoying your alone time, but just be aware of it and if they start consistently expressing that they are concerned for you then try to  connect with them in a way that isn't overwhelming for you. Wishing you all the best!",

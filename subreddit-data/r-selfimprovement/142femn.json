If i'm riding my bicycle, i have my phone in my backpack and i can control music on my earphones on my smartwatch so i wouldn't need to take it out. When i come to work i put it in the drawer and if my watch did not ring, then it means i dont need to take a peak at my phone. Basically try to keep physical distance with the phone.",

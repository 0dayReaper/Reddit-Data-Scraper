I have had so many terrible things happen in the last few months and it feels like everything is boiling over. Since February I have:\n\n-Had my dog of 11 years pass\n-Been sexually assaulted three times, the most recent was this last Friday \n-Gotten out of an abusive relationship (good that i\u2019m out but upset it happened)\n-The first person that I\u2019ve been interested in doesn\u2019t seem to want to put any effort in which is a bad blow to the self esteem rn\n-Watched an old coworker fall and snap their arm in half (I know it\u2019s a lot worse for them but it was hard to watch)\n\nI\u2019m trying to focus on the positives in my life but I have been on the verge of tears for literally a week now. Anything I have to do for work or my home just overwhelms me and I feel the waterworks. I want to get into therapy but I have literally zero idea of how to go about that in the slightest. It was very frowned upon growing up. Is there anything I can do for myself now and what would be the first steps to getting into therapy?",

            "comment": "I haven't gone to therapy myself so I cannot offer advice concerning that. Perhaps look at some reviews of therapists in your area? I've heard BetterHelp can be quite flexible in finding an appropriate therapist for you as well (and given it's online it could be discrete if that is an issue), but I also know its had controversies in the past and again, I've not tried it myself. \n\nReally I just wanted to say you must be strong for persisting through your struggles, maybe stronger than you give yourself credit for! And it's okay to breakdown, to cry, to rage, sometimes these are cathartic events we must go through to continue our growth. If possible try to let those happen in a supportive environment, or at least away from an unsupportive one! \n\nWhoever you are stranger, you're in my thoughts. I hope things improve for you, but I am sure you can and will pull through!",

    "postText": "Anyone that\u2019s been in relationship back to back figure out how to be single and be truly okay - consistently? I\u2019ve dated three guys over 6ish years. I feel okay and excited about life until I don\u2019t some nights when I\u2019m anxious and lonely. I leaned on my partners a lot for emotional support, although I\u2019ve consciously made effort to be more strong on my own. Has anyone similar to me figured it out? I just feel like my life is a bit dull and there is nothing like a partnership.",

Now I\u2019m single and left with a lot of work to do to get where I want to be. I\u2019m dedicating the remainder of this year to those goals. Let\u2019s see how I\u2019m looking next year.",

I hope that I stumble across something I wanna passionately pursue in the future like you! \n\nI sort of wish I had someone as open to share their suffering as me and just sit over a coffee together and limitlessly talk about what comes to our minds. I think I would heal just from talking. Maybe I should meditate",

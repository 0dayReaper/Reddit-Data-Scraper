    "postText": "Most people assume that \u2018having your shit together\u2019 means you\u2019re successful in your career or that you make a lot of money. \n\nIt simply means that you are in control of your life\u2014you take active ownership of your living environment, your health, your ambitions, and your finances. You put in work maintaining certain aspects of your life, which allow you to thrive and maintain your sense of independence.\n\nHaving your life in order indicates that you not only can take care of yourself, but you are able to contribute to a relationship and not be a burden. This is why responsibility is sexy\u2014men and women are biologically driven to seek partners that not only produce healthy children, but can help provide for and raise their children effectively.\n\nNo matter how physically attractive someone is, if their life is in disarray\u2014their place is a mess, they have toxic personal relationships, they have no solid goals, etc.\u2014it is a massive turn off. If someone can\u2019t handle their own lives, how can they be reliable in a relationship.\n\nFeeling safe emotionally is particularly important for women. Personal Instability and lack of reliability is a significant source of emotional distress.\n\nIt\u2019s ultimately up to you how you get your shit together, but here are some general rules:\n\n- Keep your living environment clean and organized. This is paramount. A simple act such as making your bed every morning, doing dishes, making sure your bathroom isn\u2019t nasty and stays fresh. When you bring someone over and your living environment is chaotic, they will feel uneasy and lost attraction.\n\n- Be a person of action, rather than words. Instead of telling someone you\u2019re going to do something, take actionable steps towards your goals. If you say you\u2019re going to do something, follow through.\n\n- Stay on top of your finances. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to be wealthy, but having an understanding of your expenses and savings. Having a basic understanding and knowledge of investing (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, dividends) is necessary to build wealth for yourself.\n\n- Most importantly, maintaining your health. This is not about maintaining your physical appearance(although it\u2019s a positive bonus), but rather making sure your physical and mental well being are maintained. This isn\u2019t always easy\u2014eating well, getting proper sleep, limiting caffeine and alcohol\u2014can be sacrificed for easier options that provide more monetary pleasure.  These seemingly small decisions will have a massive impact on your mental health and quality of life",

That doesn't make us unworthy of love and human connection! We just have to keep trying, be compassionate to ourselves, and be honest with the other people in our lives. \n\nIf I can't make dinner for you after all because I was too depressed to clean my fridge out, I will just tell you rather than ghosting you! : )",

I tried Wellbutrin and it made me way more anxious and depressed so I couldn't wait to get off it. It works great for some but for me, it was no good. I'm on 15mg twice a day and have to set an alarm, or I will never remember my second dose. I also use pillboxes and have built the habit of taking my meds from the box as soon as I get into the bathroom to get ready. I feel like a higher dose may be in order, but I'm trying to work up to where I need to be. Not knowing what \"normal\" feels like makes it really hard to tell. \n\nI set alarms and reminders and regularly check my lists and calendar. I still miss things, but it's gotten much better. This all helps with the low self-esteem that often comes with these disabilities because you feel so defeated and dysfunctional when you don't have any control. For years I had given up on myself and just drank a lot, focusing on having fun mostly, and just doing enough at work to get by and get that paycheck.\n\nNow I am working at excelling at work again, am feeling much better about myself, and finally have hope again. I still have a long way to go, but my life has improved quite a bit and I am even happier for it.",

They aren't building any form of portfolio whatsoever.\n\nThe market is not a gamble if you have a semblance of what you're doing, invest regularly and dispassionately, and have patience.",

Some how, these two need to compromise and negotiate.\n\nIt was suggested I make a schedule for myself. Not a hyper controlling schedule of an overbearing manager, and not the lazy day off of the employee either, but my day... My good day. Perfectly balanced, achievable, fun AND productive. \n\nLast, be kind to yourself, progress is key, not perfection. Try to make a 1% change for the better every week. Then 1% better next week.

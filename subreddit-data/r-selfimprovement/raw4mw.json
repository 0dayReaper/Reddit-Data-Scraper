    "postText": "This week I signed up to a Gym membership, and Counselling Therapy sessions for the first time in my life. \"I don't need excersize\" or \"I don't need counselling\" were words I repeated to myself every day of my life. But everything changed recently and I've started to care about wellbeing. The truth is, I still feel the same about myself. No matter how hard I try, I can't \"Love myself\". I just had to learn to love the person I want to become. I'd imagine a future-me where I was proud of myself, and I kept that image in my head. I'm so in love with future-me that I was prepared to do anything to become that person.\n\nI'm no expert, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but if you're feeling stuck like I was, maybe lying to yourself that you love yourself isn't the way to go. Maybe it's realizing you CAN love yourself in the near future, and using that to motivate yourself.",

And as you put in work, and get better both mentally or physically. the love will come out of it self. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI salute you and hope you found the drive and continue to improve your life. I did the same, and it works, i lost 30 pounds in the last half year and got a lot buffer. im proud of myself and the compliments im getting dont hurt either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ngood luck and see you on the other side homie",

I don't consider myself special in any way, and every \"accomplishment\" I've achieved pales in comparison to the accomplishment of others.\n\nBasically I have zero ego, zero respect for myself.

Chase that future \u201cyou\u201d until it becomes a reality.\n\nI went on a weight loss journey about 4 years ago after being tired of being the person I was physically. I decided to make the change and lost about 25 pounds within the span of 2 months that same year. I was so damn proud of myself, especially given I have cerebral palsy and still managed to achieve that. \n\nUnfortunately, between school struggles, mental problems, and a recent breakup after almost 5 years together with that person, I put all the weight I originally lost with literal \u201csweat and tears\u201d. I\u2019ve been  disgusted and disappointed in myself lol with the \u201cimage\u201d and feeling I let myself get to again, one I thought I had left for good but no more - I\u2019m going to make that chance once more, not only until I reach my fitness goal but for life. It will be difficult but knowing I did it before, I know I have it in me to do it again. \n\nWish you the best.",

It's not as if you do or you don't. It's a process, a journey most of us are on.\n\nSince you mentioned obesity and addiction, it may be worth looking into the difference between acceptance and enabling. Accepting someone as they are doesn't mean that you stay where you are. Accepting it means that you understand that this is where they are right now, and you decide what that means for you. It may mean loving them from a distance while ending the relationship. You don't need to sit there and watch someone slowly kill themselves. But it is an understanding that we can't force someone else to change. We can only try to change ourselves, and that's difficult enough.",

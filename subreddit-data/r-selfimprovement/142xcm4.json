I don't think anyone has ever been interested in me.  \nWhat advice would you give someone like me in terms of become more successful in the romantic / sexual realm?",

Are you bitter towards women?\n\nI would recommend paying for an escort to get your V card out of the way and out of your mind. A male\u2019s virginity is not attractive to women, and definitely not when you\u2019re in your mid to late 30s.\n\nYou should also probably find a reputable dating coach to coach you on a few sessions at least if you have the money, that should shave off your learning curve by a ton.\n\nThat\u2019s about all I can think of. If you do these 2, it should probably change things quite a bit for you.",

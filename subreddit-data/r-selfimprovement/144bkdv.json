Even though you realize deep down that there is more to life, yet you just feel confused and lost like how do you actually evolve. I think that it's true, as humans we need to explore and try new things to open new doors for opportunities and growth. But actually, how do we do this all. Like idk how to research or meet new people or going places or learning new skills, building knowledge. Sometimes I feel like learning about e-commerce, crypto, finance, trading, then self improvement and healthy living, learning a new skill that could lead to better opportunities. Anything it could be. But this fixed mindset has put us in trap that we don't seem to come out of.",

    "postText": "\n\nThe solitary most important thing you need to do on your self improvement journey is learn CORRECTLY. \n\n\nLearning is comprised of two aspects. \n\nAcknowledging. (Reading, watching, listening) \n\nRetaining. (Remembering what you learned when you need to apply it) \n\nApplying ( doing what you need to do when the time comes) \n\nThis post will help you optimize all three. \n\nHow to acknowledge correctly:\nThe process of acknowledging requires two things. \n\n1. Attention (focusing sensory organs) \n2. Reception (comprehension of the focus) \n\nIt\u2019s easy to optimize attention, focus on what you\u2019re reading, listening to, or watching. \n\nDo one thing at a time. \n\nTo optimize reception, try to summarize what you learned as you go along. If it\u2019s a complex topic try to summarize each paragraph, every 2 minute clip, Or soundbite. \n\nLook up every single word you don\u2019t understand until the concepts make sense. \n\nOnce you have effectively learned how to acknowledge new information the next most important thing is depositing it into long term memory. \n\nHow to retain: \nRetention is extremely simple but few people understand how to actually do it correctly. \n\nWhat I\u2019m about to teach you I learned while interning under a counselor who\u2019s job it was to help teach first generation college students the correct way to memorize information. \n\nRepetition does not help, Reviewing does. \n\nRepetition is like walking, it will get you there but slowly. \n\nReviewing is like taking a car, it\u2019s much faster at encoding long term memory. \n\nHow to review: \nTo review something write a prompt on a piece of paper. \n\nNow I want you to think of the answer without examining a reference. \n\nThat process of recalling carves a mental grove in your brain, linking a trigger, the prompt, to a response, the information. \n\nIf you instead used a notecard and immediately examined the answer\u2026 your brain didn\u2019t have to do anything. \nSo minimal learning occurs. \n\nIf you repeat instead of review, the second you stop repeating the information begins to fade. \n\nAfter learning how to review I can recall some texts verbatim I haven\u2019t read in years. \n\nHow to apply: \nOnce you\u2019ve learned how to receive information, retain the information the only thing standing in your way is application. \n\nWhen it comes down to applying, it\u2019s mostly our reluctance to act that stands in our way. \n\nTo overcome this, focus on habit formation . \n\nPick the habit you just learned about, pick the absolute smallest step, do it for 30 days. Then up the intensity. \n\nWhen I started at the gym I literally just lifted the bar because that\u2019s all I could do. \n\nI now lift with 2 x 45lb weights 2 years later. \n\nThat\u2019s it. \n\nOptimize your intake. \nOptimize your retention. \nOptimize your application. \n\nThen you will grow.",

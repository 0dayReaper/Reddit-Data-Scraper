    "postText": "**My interpretation**: A common and natural experience of life is to blame others, or even the world for its imperfections, and the inconveniences and pain it has caused you. As one gets older and matures, this blame tends to turn inward as we begin to focus on all the ways we have not lived up to our own standards, or the problems we have caused in the world. There is one final stage, however, that not everyone reaches, which is to to nonjudgmentally accept life as it is and to just focus finding ways to make things better.",

Then I looked into myself and found a fucking nest of problems. And for the past couple years blamed everything on myself. And I'm really hard on myself, to the point of hindering my ability of be happy. And I've begun to think, maybe I blame myself because it's easy. If I'm miserable and unhappy then if I fail at everything then it makes sense. I'm victimizing myself in my own brain and using that as some weird rational to not try at life. But that's wrong. I should treat myself as someone worthy  of respect. If I knew someone who treated a friend of mines the way I treat myself I would be fucking pissed.",

Because blaming yourself when you are wrong is taking responsibility for your mistake, which is fine. And that is all you can do, try to not repeat it in the future and move on.\n\nBut if instead of moving on, you start judging yourself for the mistake, it accomplishes nothing other than crippling you and making you miserable. \n\nJudging yourself in your head is the problem. If you only say \"I did x and y wrong, they shouldn't be done this way\" and move on, all is good. \nBut if you start \"I fucked x and y up. I suck. I can't do this shit. I don't deserve being x or y.\" etc. then you will continue to be stuck on those things until you decide to let it go and stop judging/thinking about it. \n\nThis is a mental habit everybody can retrain themselves to do. \nTry thinking in non-judgmental ways and when you catch yourself judging, change it. Do that all the time and eventually you won't have mental feces in your thoughts anymore.",

                    "comment": "That's an excellent question. I think the best way to approach it is - what is the purpose of justice? When we want justice, what are we asking for? \n\nFrom the Wikipedia entry about justice: \n\n\"Justice, in its broadest sense, is the principle that people receive that which they deserve, with the interpretation of what then constitutes \"deserving\" being impacted upon by numerous fields, with many differing viewpoints and perspectives, including the concepts of moral correctness based on ethics, rationality, law, religion, equity and fairness.\n\nConsequently, the application of justice differs in every culture.\"\n\nHow do we decide what someone deserves? In America we have a Bill of Rights and a criminal justice system. The one guarantees positive rights, and the other punishes things we've decided are wrong. But even today, as I am sure you are aware, we are fraught with conflict over both what we consider to be positive rights and what we consider to be wrong. We can't come to agreement about what people deserve, in both the bad and good sense.\n\nI think this quote is asking people to stop trying to force the world into fairness by thinking about what we all *deserve* and to instead start trying to *understand and accept each other and ourselves with compassion.* \n\n\"When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don't blame the lettuce. You look for reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet, if we have problems with our friends or family, we blame the other person. But if we know how to take care of them, they will grow well, like the lettuce. Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using reason and argument. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no argument, just understanding. If you understand, and show that you understand, you can love, and the situation will change.\" - Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nWhat does this look like in application? It means shifting from a mindset of coercing good behavior with the threat of punishment to a mindset of supporting healthy behavior by meeting people's needs. Instead of sending people to prison, we address all the reasons why they ended up there in the first place. Instead of hitting a child for stealing something, we address the reasons why they wanted to steal. Instead of getting down on yourself for failing to complete a task, you figure out what stopped you from succeeding and try something else next time.",

This is a great chance to examine the difference between treating someone with compassion and holding healthy boundaries.\n\nSay someone wrongs you somehow. I don't want to get too specific about any given misbehavior because I think it's useful to keep this fairly abstract at first. **Blaming them** would mean labeling them or their choice as morally bad and demanding some kind of punishment. **Treating them with compassion** is taking the time to understand why they did what they did and looking for practical solutions for supporting better behavior in the future. **Drawing healthy boundaries** means assessing your ability to help them, and, if you don't think you can effectively assist them without hurting yourself, limiting your contact or adjusting your behavior to protect yourself. \n\nYour primary job is to take care of yourself. You can't help other people effectively if your needs aren't met. You can absolutely treat other people with compassion (understand who they are and why they do what they do) and also choose to take care of yourself first. That doesn't mean punishing someone else to make yourself feel better - that means accepting other people as they are and adjusting your behavior to meet your needs.\n\nNow let's explore a specific instance. Something doesn't get done before a deadline at work and a coworker blames you for it, even though it was actually their fault. Instead of insisting that your coworker is punished for what happened, you can treat the situation with compassion by determining why the task wasn't accomplished. Maybe your coworker is having a lot of stress at home and is unusually forgetful right now. Maybe you're in a position to help that coworker access therapy or help them organize their work and schedule more effectively. But let's say you aren't in that position - then you can choose to change your behavior. For example, moving forward, you can keep an email record of all tasks assigned to you, when they were assigned, and when they were completed, so if this situation comes up again, you can demonstrate that you did your part on time. \n\nOf course, life isn't always clean and clear and it isn't always easy to meet your own needs, help out others, and adjust your behavior to suit the nature of the people around you. The idea is simply to practice changing your mindset from one of blaming to one of compassion, and then see how that shift impacts your choices in life.",

Living with anger and negativity about something is not going to help you improve regardless of whether it is \"justified\". Justification means complete ass rubbish, bc what does it matter, you live iwth anger about what somebody did to do you and what?!?! it helps, you get better?!!? no It doenst help us improve, move on, become better, survive whatever.  But definitely i do think its very important for people who have dealt with traumas or been at the receiving end of someone else's bad actions its important to not blame yourself and turn that guilt onto you.",

I was abused as a child &amp; still live in the same home where the abuse took place, with my abusers. I always subconsciously blamed myself for the abuse &amp; didn't care about myself because of it.\n\nIt was only once I moved back home after college in 2018 - 2019 the blame at my parents really came to the surface. I saw them as responsible for all my failures. The worst part was they convinced me it was my fault. That there was something wrong with me. \n\nThen towards the end of 2019 &amp; beginning of 2020 I stopped blaming them. My dad got really sick. He developed kidney issues. The guilt for what he did to me was literally destroying him. I realized, not over night &amp; not all at once, I truly cannot blame him. \n\nI also realized how my forgiving him &amp; my mother was altering a long line of ancestral trauma. I'm really into astrology &amp; I saw how my familial lessons were written in my chart. I realized finding peace with them, with my childhood, was a vital part of my growth.\n\nLike I said, It didn't happen over night. But throughout 2020 I released the anger &amp; betrayal I felt towards them. I no longer blame them &amp; I truly have peace with it.",

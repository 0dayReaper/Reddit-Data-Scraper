You've probably gone through multiple stages of both progression and regression that have made you doubt whether or not it is possible to stop slipping back into your old ways. I've been through the motions too many times to count, so I know: it sucks.\n\nBut have you ever wondered **why** you keep regressing to your old degenerate ways? Have you ever considered what causes it and when it happens?\n\nUnderstanding this will be the first step towards achieving progress for longer and more often.\n\nAnd don't worry! It's not because of some external force, genetic condition, or ingrained personality trait that is the cause of this. It's usually due to a lack of knowledge or certain misunderstandings. \n\nAnybody can change with the correct awareness and beliefs. Truly. It just takes some time.\n\nHere is my ultimate guide to why you keep regressing and struggling to progress. There are quite a few points, so let's not waste any more time.\n\n# Do You Deserve It?\n\nSelf-improvement is hard. If you don't find it difficult, you're probably doing something wrong.\n\nWhether it is a business you're trying to build, a body you're trying to perfect, or just a simple habit you're trying to stick to, you will face resistance.\n\nThis resistance will manifest in countless ways: procrastination, fear, anxiety, doubt, perfectionism, avoidance, etc. How you react to and tolerate that resistance determines just how much you deserve to progress.\n\nThe reason for this is that it is the universe testing you to see if you deserve whatever desired result you're striving for. You ask the universe for a desired future, and in return, it challenges you to make sure you deserve it. These challenges from the universe will come as a form of resistance.\n\nWhen you apply effort to something that you are resisting, you will get pain.\n\n**Effort x Resistance = Pain**\n\nHowever much pain you are willing to tolerate and persist with will predict how much success you will be given.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201c*To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. The world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a whole bunch of undeserving people*.\u201d \\~ *Charlie Munger*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you tolerate and persist with 80% of the pain you have felt? Then the universe will give you 80% of the desired outcome. If it is 40%, then you'll get 40%. You can also think of this in terms of momentum.\n\nThe universe is always watching and will know when you're deserving of something. It almost works like a transaction: you want a desired outcome, the universe asks for pain as currency to pay for this outcome, you accumulate this currency and pay when you meet resistance with effort, and then you get the amount you deserve.\n\nSo ask yourself: how do you react to resistance? Do you give up quickly? Do you give in to resistance and reduce all effort that is needed?\n\nNow ask yourself: do you deserve to achieve your goals given how much pain you tolerate and how much effort you meet resistance with?\n\n# You Are At War With Yourself\n\nOn the topic of pain, there is a form of resistance you feel that you might never have noticed. A form of resistance that will peak when you have the most momentum.\n\nWhat is this form of resistance?\n\nThe fear of improving. The fear of forming a different, better identity.\n\nAll living things have a sort of factory setting that ensures every action they take is geared towards a better chance of survival. Otherwise, organisms would die out. *Duh.*\n\nWhen you improve, you are moving further and further away from your current identity; you are transcending into someone different - into someone capable of achieving your goals.\n\nAnd your current sense of self *hates* that. What you are essentially doing is committing a form of psychological suicide.\n\nAnd remember, things are geared to survive. Your current self will put up a fight to try and keep you from evolving and killing your current identity.\n\nIt fights by creating fear, doubt, anxiety, etc. It will fight the hardest when you are closest to killing it and transcending. This is when you are most likely to concede to the negative emotions it conjures up.\n\nThis is why you have a wave-like pattern of ups and downs. Your current self keeps fighting to pull you back, and it does so with formidable determination.\n\nYou must take note when you are gaining momentum and reaching a peak. These are the moments when pain and resistance must be tolerated most.\n\nAlso, remember: you know yourself best. So your current self will pit every weakness against you. It won't play nice and most certainly won't play fair. It's fighting to survive!\n\n# The Brick Wall Of Beliefs\n\nBeliefs dictate how reality manifests to you. How you perceive the world, other people, and everything else is the result of your belief systems.\n\nYou could be getting pranked into a false sense of reality for your whole life.\n\nFor example, if you believe that bulls get provoked by the colour red, you will go through life adhering to that. So if you see a matador wave a red cape in front of a raging bull, you will think: \"Oh, it's angry because of the red!\". When in truth, bulls are red-green colour-blind. It is the motion of the cape that provokes them.\n\nThat was a trivial example, but imagine how many false or negative beliefs have a significant impact.\n\nAnd once you believe something and receive feedback, the belief strengthens and solidifies. Then it becomes harder to break and has more emotion tied to it\n\nUnderstand, however, that no belief is necessarily bad. If your beliefs are in accordance with nature and are conducive towards your goals, who is to say they are bad?\n\nUnfortunately, most people will go through life without realising this and continue to have beliefs that work against and limit them.\n\nMaybe you believe that:\n\n* You can't improve\n* Improving is hard\n* It is hard to be happy\n* It is difficult to change your beliefs\n\nIf you believe these, they will likely become true due to feedback loops.\n\nThe most important belief is believing that you are capable of changing your beliefs. Neuroplasticity has proven that you can change the neural circuits in your brain. You are not fixed. You are malleable and are in control of rewiring your brain.\n\nUse this information to your advantage: set yourself up for success by converting negative beliefs into good ones.\n\nYour beliefs will determine what actions you take. If you want to change your actions, change your beliefs.\n\nIf you believe improving is difficult or takes forever, then it will present itself as so.\n\nIf you believe that you will always regress, then you will.\n\nIf you believe you can't do x, y, or z,  you probably won't be able to.\n\nSet yourself up for success. Adopt **serving** beliefs and act accordingly. Get positive results and let the feedback response do the rest.\n\nBeliefs can make or break you. What would you prefer?\n\n# Diving Straight Into The Deep End\n\nThis is dedicated to my fellow perfectionists, over-achievers, and people who set way too high a standard for themselves.\n\nFirstly, hey! Secondly: it sucks, doesn't it?\n\nWhen I first decided to create a routine, it took me two days. **Two**. **Days.** How f\\*cking crazy is that? I reckon That's a record.\n\nI over-perfected the shit out of that routine. I included: meditation, journalling, playing an instrument, learning a language, reading time, writing time, gym work, yoga, jogging, meditation again, studying, visualisation, deep work... and much more. Oh, and I also planned every single 30 minutes of the day.\n\nShit, I feel overwhelmed just reading that. Wtf was I thinking?\n\nI jumped into a routine - that should take years to implement - within just a few seconds. And I had hardly ever done most of those habits before!\n\nDo you think it was sustainable? Of course not. I stuck to it for about one week (if that).\n\nMy past self really did have his bruh moments.\n\nIt took me a few more (ok, *many* more) attempts to figure out how slowly I should take it.\n\nSo bro, chill with it a bit at first, y'know? Don't dive straight into the deep end. My journey started properly by *underachieving*. Only then I could build on it.\n\nSo, instead of doing a hundred things at once, go reaaaal low. Lower than you think you should. You've got to play limbo with this shit.\n\nOtherwise, you'll burn out and overwhelm yourself.\n\nInstead of setting a goal of 30 mins of meditation for 30 days, set a goal of 3 mins of meditation for five days. Once you've proven yourself capable, then add more to the discipline. You can also add new habits to complement it.\n\nAnd if you struggle with that, go even lower. There is no shame in it - you don't need to be a sigma-male, nut-sack-grindset, wake-up-at-3:45 am-every-day, and meditate-57-hours-per-day nerd to \"improve\". There is no rush. Rushing into it is more likely to waste your time and cause you to default to old ways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A super-cool quick tip:** Instead of setting goals and putting them on a pedestal, create \"messy experiments\". If, like me, you have consistently been inconsistent with your disciplines, you will probably feel like you will fail before you start, creating undue tension and stress.\n\nBy creating experiments, you remove this mindset, giving it a less stressful appearance.\n\n* Failing a goal: \"Oh no, I failed! I'm bad at this. I keep struggling to stick to things.\"\n* Failing an experiment: \"Oh, this didn't go to plan! I will create another experiment and, based upon what I learned, alter it slightly.\"\n\nThis has worked well for me. Experiments I don't tend to over-plan or perfect. Goals and stuff like that I do. Why don't you *experiment* (sorry) and see what works for you?\n\n# Are You Someone That You Want to Improve?\n\nThis point is of such significance that I created a separate Reddit post about it.\n\nAre you sure that you are someone that you want the best for? Are you somebody that you want to care for and look after? Do you treat yourself more like a friend or a foe?\n\nHas it ever occurred to you the possibility that you don't like yourself enough to be better?\n\nHave you ever gone out of your way to thoroughly improve the quality of life for somebody you find insufferable?\n\nI doubt it.\n\nIf you see yourself as insufferable, it will be near-impossible to progress. Your beliefs determine your actions, remember.\n\nIf you act out of alignment with your beliefs you will create incongruence. Act in a way that says: \"I want to improve\", but then think of yourself as someone who deserves the worst, and it just ain't gonna work, man.\n\nYou'll be able to make some progress, but you will fall back to default quickly. Self-sabotage will be way too rife.\n\nIf you believe this is the case, please try to focus on rekindling your relationship with yourself.\n\n# Don't Raise The Roof; Raise Your Standards\n\nWould you tolerate going for one week without washing? What about one month?\n\nHow about your teeth; how long would you tolerate going without brushing them?\n\nNow, take note of every time that you have broken this intolerance. Chances are, you haven't (at least I hope not, you dirty animal).\n\nInstead of raising goals and reaching high into the sky, raise your standards instead. Standards you never breach, goals you rarely reach. It even has a nice lil rhyme!\n\nPutting goals up high inflates their importance, making you think they're difficult to obtain. The more unobtainable something seems, the less reasonable it will seem to act towards. Thus, you won't act as you are required.\n\nIf, instead, you set goals as your new standard, you will work towards ensuring you never dip below them or breach them.\n\nThink right now about the default habits and actions you keep returning to. Notice how you never go lower than that? It's because you won't tolerate it. Lowering yourself past that would disgust you or make you feel slightly sick.\n\nWhen you notice yourself gaining momentum or starting to peak, be aware and make it a standard from now on. This will help prevent you from regressing.\n\nYou can do this for both short-term and long-term situations. Either way, it shifts your ass into gear if implemented correctly.\n\nRemind yourself of this often. It can take some time to stick.\n\n# You're A Little Too Cozy\n\nYou are likely improving yourself to make your situation better. That's what you think.\n\nThe more likely reason is that you're trying to *escape* an undesirable situation. Instead of chasing something, you're running from something.\n\nThe more undesirable - or uncomfortable - your situation, the more drive you will have to free yourself from it.\n\nSo, if you're content with how things are, you have nothing to run from.\n\nThis creates less urgency and a less powerful call to action.\n\nLots of successful people (whose wealth isn't family derived) have track records of being in horrible situations.\n\nIf you're doing pretty solid right now, you might not be able to justify the effort needed to do the work required to improve.\n\nI'm not saying that you need to make yourself seriously uncomfortable! That would be dumb.\n\nHowever, some situational analysis could come in handy.\n\nWhat would your dream position be in five years? Would you reach that dream situation, given how you currently behave? Give this some deep thought, not a barely-conscious read. This stuff is vital.\n\nCompare who you are right now with who you need to be to achieve your dreams. Do they match? If not, what sort of future do you envision if you continue as you are?\n\nExplore this more and see if it helps. Jordan Peterson has a course called \"the self-authoring Program\", which is all of this, but in detail. I've not personally bought it, but I've heard great things.\n\n# \"You're a victim!\"\n\nThe victim mentality is yet another one of the unfortunate cancers that society propagates as normality. Most of the time, it is promoted and endorsed.\n\nVictim mentality is phenomenal... if you want to sacrifice your freedom to take control of your life.\n\nDon't get me wrong - shit happens to people. Real bad things. And there will be circumstances that call for a time to say: \"It's not my fault!\". This is rare. And in any case, being indignant has never helped anybody.\n\nAs long as you offload blame for your current circumstance onto other people and external forces, you will remain unable to take control of your life. You will perpetually flee from responsibility.\n\nIt isn't anyone's fault.\n\nIt isn't some higher being's fault.\n\nIt isn't that one person who said that one thing that caused that one thing's fault.\n\nWhere you currently are is a result of every action you've ever taken. Sometimes things will happen to you that are out of your control. How you react and use these experiences *is* within your control, however.\n\nThe more control and excuses you attach to other people, the less power you have over your development.\n\nHaving the \"f\\*ck everyone else, it's all their fault, capitalism is a scam, life's unfair, blah blah blah\" mentality is such an easy way out. So firstly, how boring! Secondly, Nobody with sense will want to be around you. And thirdly, you will shut down avenues of improvement that will stunt your growth.\n\nIt isn't easy to suddenly feel responsible for so much in your life. It might feel quite daunting! But it is much better than living your life as a shell of what you could have been.\n\nHopefully, at the same time, it feels liberating. You can finally take back control.\n\nTake responsibility, and the growth potential becomes infinite.\n\n# Direction, Direction, Direction.\n\nDo you have clear goals? Do you know *exactly* who you need to become for these goals?\n\nA vivid picture of the future should be painted in your mind. This is vital for many reasons:\n\n1. Trajectory prevents chaos and anxiety. Instead, it promotes order and a sense of direction.\n2. It allows the subconscious to justify work and give reason to your actions.\n3. He who is lost cannot be found.\n\nIf you do not have goals or an understanding of who you want to become - and I mean a *really clear* understanding - then you will go through life blind. You will stumble into who you become rather than intentionally choosing the best future for yourself.\n\nIf you do tasks for the sake of it - like meditation and journalling - and don't apply any reason or purpose behind them, you will struggle to maintain them. \n\nYou won't be able to justify doing them when resistance comes into play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*\"He who has a why can bear almost any how\" - Friedrich Nietzsche*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you have an intense and clear image of the ideal future set out for yourself, you will naturally find aligning your actions for improvement easier. Your subconscious will no longer be working against you. \n\nYou'll be shooting in the dark if you're uncertain who you're becoming.\n\nThis will make your actions seem unimportant or futile. \n\nAs long as there is a lack of intention behind your actions, It will be hard to track any form of significant improvement. \n\nFind your \"what\", and you will have a \"why\". This will empower every action you take. \n\n# You're Not Tracking Enough\n\nIf you do not track what you do:\n\n1. How will you be able to know if you do or do not make progress?\n2. You will not be able to identify patterns for your progression/regression.\n\nFirstly: how certain are you that you are not making progress?\n\nIf you're not tracking your habits and what you're doing, you will struggle to evaluate your situation and how you're doing.\n\nUse google sheets - or something similar - and note some important metrics:\n\n* Were you consistent today?\n* How focused were you?\n* How did you find it?\n* Is anything else of significance to add?\n\nOver time you will build a bank of understanding and, most importantly, a way to identify your highs and lows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou need an objective way to identify what you're doing. It will allow you to identify any emerging patterns that either aid or hinder your progress.\n\nOnce you notice these patterns, you can learn to identify them as they happen, allowing you to rectify them. Understanding yourself and patterns of action that lead to regression is paramount to preventing it from happening. \n\nThe first step is always awareness.\n\nBecome your own lil data scientist. Seeing tangible data about yourself and using it to learn more about yourself to grow can be surprisingly fun.\n\n# Concluding Thoughts And Stuff\n\nIt's important not to beat yourself up when you have dips; it's all a part of the learning process. I know it's disheartening after all the work you've put in, but no experience is a bad experience.\n\nSetbacks are necessary to grow: you need them to learn and develop.\n\nSo, be grateful for the setbacks. They are a test for you to prove your worth - to see how much you deserve to progress.\n\nYou should feel honoured that the universe has chosen *you* to rise to the occasion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe purpose of the post was to give you insight into why progression can seem so challenging. I talked little about solutions, as that would make the post kinda chunky. \n\nAlthough I touch on how to solve each issue slightly, there is much more depth to them that I want to describe separately.\n\nThus, I will make future posts with solutions dedicated to each separate issue and how I have personally dealt with them. That's the plan, at least!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are probably a bunch more points to discuss, but these are the ones that have been most prevalent for me. \n\nSo lmk what you think! I'd love to hear anything you've learnt from experience.\n\nThanks for reading.",

    "postText": "I started a new job last year and I've been getting along with my coworkers great. Id be invited out, make jokes together, I've never really had any real problems with them. But recently I found out they went out as a group without me. A coworker asked me why I didn't come with them, I obviously didn't know and I shrugged, saying I didn't hear anything about it. Later that day another coworker asked if I wanted to hang out with them to which I said yes. \n\nThe moment I was out with them it was just.. off. As if I wasnt supposed to be there. I saw other coworkers exchanging glances with a knowing look, and looking to the side, I saw that they had a whole seperate group chat without me. I just want to know why there was such a sudden change in their behavior, I'm just so confused and broken hearted, this was the first job I had where I felt I belonged. Welp, not anymore. I dont know how to act around them anymore?\n\nI also came to realize that all my life, nobody really wanted to stick around. I can get along with people just fine, people even call me charming. But that's it. Nobody wants to hang out, get to know me, or have a deeper relationship with me. Not even my own parents did. I'm just too much. I rarely make any deep connections with people. I constantly feel like there's a wall between me and people. And the loneliness is really getting to me. I wish I knew what was wrong with me. Honestly Im thinking of giving up trying to make connections and just stay alone. It hurts less that way. \n\nI just wish someone would tell me what's wrong with me? Why am I able to get along with everyone on the surface, but when it comes to times like this Im just isolated? Am I that horrible? I make sure to stay polite and be socialble but clearly somethings wrong with me?",

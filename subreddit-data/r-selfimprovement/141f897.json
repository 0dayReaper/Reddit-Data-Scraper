    "postText": "I\u2019m a 34 y/o male and currently living back at my mum\u2019s due to a break up I had last year. I\u2019m saving a decent amount of my wage each month as the rent is low and I don\u2019t have many outgoings. I work in marketing and enjoy the job but starting to feel bored, not just of the job but bored of life (not in a suicidal way). I feel I have a few options of what to do next so any advice or suggestions would be fantastic. \n\nI could either stay at my mum\u2019s and continue to save for either a house deposit which would take a few years or save up for some financial security. Another option is moving out into a flat I can rent closer to work but not sure if this is just dead money and not worth it, it would be good to get my own place though. A big option could be to save up and go travelling/work abroad. I\u2019ve never done anything like that and not sure if I\u2019d regret not doing it when I\u2019m older. The only part that worries me about this is what to do when I finish travelling/decide to come home, would I be back to square one again? \nI\u2019d love to start a family but being single and living at my mum\u2019s isn\u2019t a great start to finding a future wife. So I also need to consider this. Always thought I\u2019d be a young dad with a big family, life hasn\u2019t ended up this way.\nI\u2019m just curious as to which of these you think would give me the biggest life improvement.",

You can still do marketing online from anywhere in the world. I'm a chef so I'm not that lucky but I'm working on something on the side that'll be releasing soon.\n\nAnyway... I left the UK at 18 and lived like a playboy throughout my 20s. Settled down and tried for years to have kids. We gave up 3 years ago and 6 months later, my wife fell pregnant. Life has a funny way of throwing things at you when you least expect it so start getting in life's way. You'll be less bored at worst and might find everything you ever wanted at best",

You might have to start off small as a new freelancer but as you build up referrals and testimonies, you can charge more and more. \n\nMaybe a marketing YouTube channel would work for you too. This will help showcase your skills and build an audience that you could later sell to. Build a course and market that. There's so much opportunity out there.",

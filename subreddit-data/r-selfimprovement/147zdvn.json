    "postText": "I am struggling with negative thoughts.  Not self harm, but just negative thoughts about myself.  My partner. My kids.  I just go into a situation feeling irritated and negative- which in turn has me just walking away and avoiding situations because I\u2019m so frustrated I\u2019d rather just walk away then fight. \n\nMy partner is sober almost a year.  I left him after years of him abusing alcohol and being verbally abusive to me. He is doing a lot better BUT we are still in counseling trying to work through some stuff.   I just find myself not caring.  I have zero sex drive, and I don\u2019t even really care. I am (or used to be) a pretty fun and passionate person but I feel like that last year has sucked the life out of me.  Between his drinking, some tough relationship decisions, raising teens and all that goes with that- and running a business- I am just exhausted &amp; apathetic.  \n\nI am definitely struggling with some depression.  \n\nI am looking for recommendations for some books or something to help get me out of my rut to make me feel again, something other than just annoyance and anger.  My partner is not perfect, by any means, but my brain has just been wired to expect the worst from him even when he is trying his best- which has caused some major friction.  \n\nAnyway- any books to help me get past my apathy or change my perspective is greatly appreciated!",

    "postText": "I have so much I want to do with my life. I have goals, dreams and hopes for myself, but the second I start, for example, a calorie deficit, going to the gym more, a new training course for work or trying to learn a new skill, it's like my brain is suddenly going a million miles an hour. I feel so incredibly stressed that I always end up caving and returning to default settings of laziness, anxiety, negative self-talk, etc.\n\nEven if I take one thing at a time, like learning a new skill, and even if I take it slowly, e.g. setting aside 2 hours a week to learn, I crumble. I cannot handle even the slightest amount of pressure.\n\nWhen thinking about it, I think the stress comes from a fear of failure and change. For example, when I'm at the gym, I get a lot of anxiety about moving up to the next set of weights in case I can't do it; I've always been overweight, and I've realised that I use my body as an excuse as why people won't like me; I've never been exceptionally talented in anything, and when I think about learning something new I'm afraid trying will just confirm that.\n\nI don't know where this fear came from; I'm an introvert with next to no social life, but I'm a pretty lucky person - I have a fantastic WFH job, I'm close to my family, I live in a beautiful flat in the centre of my city, and it is just me at home so I don't have to worry too much about money. \n\nI do enjoy my life. I don't want to seem ungrateful... but I wouldn't forgive myself if, in 5 years, I was in precisely the same place as I am now - no hobbies, no social life, overweight etc.\n\nAny advice anyone may have for me would be appreciated.",

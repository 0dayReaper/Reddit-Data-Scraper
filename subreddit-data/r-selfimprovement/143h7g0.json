    "postText": "I came to a realization recently, I never felt like I had much mentorship from my parents or those around me. I felt like my ideas or who I was never really fit in in school, and never had a feeling of someone accepting, understanding me, and being able to give appropriate advice. Maybe it stems from feeling like the internet raised me.\n\nI'm wondering if this is relatable to anyone here, if you had a mentor / or if you feel like having one would make a huge difference in your life?",

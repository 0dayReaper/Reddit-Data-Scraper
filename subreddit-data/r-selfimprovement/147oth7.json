All the skills you need will develop simply by paying attention. You'll build the ability to defuse situations or direct them.\n\nAnd what you'll also find is what it's like to deal with bad communicators. No matter how hard you try, they will always mismatch you and you'll be left unfulfilled. And the bad communicator will be left feeling lonely. \n\nCommunication is *not* hard to learn - it's just that there are few effective models out there for learning it. Emotional Intelligence is the model that worked for me.\n\nI struggled with this shit my whole life. Once I studied emotions, the problems suddenly started going away. No special social skills study whatsoever.",

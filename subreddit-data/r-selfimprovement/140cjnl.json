    "postText": "Hello everyone\nLet me introduce myself\nIm a 27yo/M and im addicted to drugs and tobacco. \nFriday night i had a few beers, had me some codein and slept ok till morning. \nSaturday morning, i was supposed to play some soccer with a few friends. Before the game we smoked a joint and something weird happened\nEverything started getting bright, like really white and shit. It was 9AM, i couldn't see anything. \nI couldn't hear anything or anyone because there was this really pinch sound that was getting high and higher every Second. \n\nI don't think It was the drugs because Ive been doing different type of drugs and none of them felt anything remotely close to this. I thought i wouldn't get back from that place, since it was not getting better. I think i went there for a few minutes. \nCame back home, slept for like 4 hours( i can't remember How i got home) and then after watching a football game, i slept for another 14 hours. \nWhat exactly happened to me?  IS this dangrrous?\nNo more drugs, no more smoking, no more eating junk food. \n\nAny easy diet i should try?",

I had problems with school, i averaged a 2.3 gpa and most of my teachers aswell as our school counselors accepted that I was a lost cause.

If you one day don't do as well or fail, just remember to be kind to yourself and not value your self esteem on your achievements. Just know that you can always get back on track, because you've already done it once before :)",

You can do it (you pretty much showed everyone). \n\nI can relate, I flunk school unofficially (in my country, the system just wants you out with a degree so it lets you go to the next step even if you only have 25% in key subjects). I barely passed my highschool diploma and completely and miserably failed my first university year, we're talking 0.7 gpa there. Yes. 0.7, at 18 I was pretty much finished education-wise. Since then? I completed two bachelors, a masters and I'm currently doing a MBA and a law degree with a 4.0 gpa (and I'm only 26). It's possible. It's not easy but it just takes discipline and sheer motivation. Looks like you have both!",

So it is up to you to make yourself relevant in this world, which it seems, you are heading in the right direction. Teen years are the toughest to go through. Try some community service work to give back. It seems dumb but can be very rewarding and looks good on paper if you ever needed it. Good luck and stay strong. Just remember this.... Those thoughts in our head.. Some are lies and some are truths. It's up to you to decide which is which. If the voice inside says negative things then tell it to hush. You are better than that. \ud83e\udd1b\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude4c",

I am probably older than your parents and have dealt with depression since I was a child. I can tell you for certain what you have done is awesome because your story resonated with me. One thing I would like to share with you. At some point I realized how cruel my inner dialogue had become. I had the aha moment when I realized I would NEVER let someone talk to my child the way I \"Talked to myself\". So as several folks have said, be kind to yourself, defend yourself and celebrate all you have accomplished.",

    "postText": "So I'm pretty young, and for some reason I'm very very insecure; girls always told me I'm very good looking tho, I'm pretty shredded, normal height and everything. But I'm very insecure, even with all the compliments, I find myself ugly, like I'm not ever enough.\n\nThis negatively affect my relationship, especially with how my girlfriend dresses; I get very very uncomfortable and upset when my girlfriends wears something a bit too revealing, like those shorts a bit too short, or those skirts a bit too short or tops with deep necklines.\n\nI don't know if I'm right or wrong, I think it's in my respect that she doesn't wear things that reveal a bit too much of her tits or ass or any private part, but at the same time deep inside of me I know it's wrong in some way but don't know how.\n\nI just want to learn how to stop being jealous about it so that I and my girlfriend can both profit from it.",

If she's dressing up to the point, you're getting jealous. Own the pride that she is yours. Turn that jealousy into desire and want. She is yours, and you are hers. But respect the fact that she is also still allowed to love herself. Just as you do for yourself.\n\nPutting care into your appearance is a very uplifting thing for one's mind and heart. Help 'em amplify it by showing 'em off and *show/tell* them how damn beautiful/sexy they are. Tell them that the fact other men keep eyeing 'em makes you jealous. But be humble and respectful. They choose to be with you. Not them.",

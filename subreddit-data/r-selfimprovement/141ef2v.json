    "postText": "I have never really had any grand dreams or ambitions in life. When I thimk about where I want to be in say five years or what I think my future will look like I can't really come up with anything. I'm not super interested in anything and unually never feel motivated to work hard for anything in life.  The times I do its all externally motivated like family/peer pressure, fomo, wanting some validation. Idk. I wish i was internally motivated about something in life. I think its a gift really to be able to deeply care and learn about things and I wish I had it. Nothing really moves me much. I've never been able to get good at any of my hobbies and have no career aspirations either.\nI just live passively from one moment to the next and don't really think about anything. I feel empty and boring but also don't feel motivated to change myself.",

            "comment": "Your life purpose doesn't have to be grand or ambitious to be valid and fulfilling. It just has to be something you authentically love doing, no matter how small. Perhaps you are limiting yourself by saying a dream is only valid if it is BIG. Think smaller.\n\nAlso, sometimes we feel empty/numb on the inside when we've cut ourselves off from feeling for one reason or another. I'm not sure if this resonates with you or not, but throwing it out there.\n\nCan you remember the last time you felt joy about anything -- no matter how small? If so, what was it? \n\nYou say you have hobbies but that you haven't been able to get good at them. Do you think you can't get better at them? Maybe you aren't giving yourself enough credit. Regardless, do you enjoy your hobbies? Our pure love and joy of something is the only thing that really winds up motivating us. But it can take time to tap into our hearts in order to feel that spark again.",

            "comment": "One way to combat this is by setting small, achievable goals for yourself. Break down larger tasks into smaller steps and celebrate each accomplishment along the way. It can give you a sense of progress and boost your motivation.\r Consider using the Forfeit app as a tool to add some external accountability. It's an app where you set goals and tasks for yourself, and if you don't complete them or provide evidence, you lose money. This can help create a sense of urgency and keep you accountable to your commitments.\r  \n\r  \nDon't put too much pressure on finding a grand passion right away. Instead, explore different interests, hobbies, and activities. Sometimes, the smallest spark of curiosity can lead to something more significant. Be open-minded and give yourself permission to explore and learn without the expectation of immediate mastery.",

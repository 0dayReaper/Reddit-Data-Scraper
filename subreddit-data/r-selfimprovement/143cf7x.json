Ego can be an effective tool to create progress, or a debilitating force for self destruction, leaving you feeling completely hopeless.

At the end of the day, the only thing that truly matters are the people important to you. There\u2019s often happiness in a poor family, than a rich man.",

Individualism doesn\u2019t necessarily means inability to cooperate it just identifies the self and your personal values in the surrounding world with the experience you\u2019ve obtained. Having these personal values can lead to like minded and diverse collaboration with others instead of the opposite. It\u2019s not individualism dividing us as much as it is moral subjectivism and the inability to tolerate variance in these morals. People making assumptions of someone\u2019s character based entirely on their morals and the inability to communicate and come to compromise within a set of values is what the real problem is. its a fight of dominance in a gigantic tree of binary systems where situations are bent to be right or wrong with no allowance for a middle ground on either side.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\n I\u2019m 23 years old turning 24 in August and I feel like a complete failure. Long story short I was a really sheltered kid growing up never went to parties never drank etc. I had incredible grades in high school and went to college to become a lawyer. When I left my parents nest I went off the rails partying smoking pot you name it. It got to the point where I dropped out at 19 ( my grades were fine but I wasn\u2019t taking it serious enough to justify the money I was spending) \n\n After my stint at uni, I went back to community college and apprenticed to become a master distiller of all things ( kind of an impulse decision on my part ) which is where I am now. My wage had plateaued and I don\u2019t see a future in the industry so I am now going back to university and starting over from scratch taking computer science. \n\n I\u2019ve moved back in with my parents. I will likely be here until I finish my degree. I feel like a complete loser and seeing the kids I went to high school with becoming successful and getting married depresses me further. Is there anyone who had been in a similar situation that can offer me some advice ?",

Im 38 now and getting everything sorted to go back to uni in a couple of years. I might be graduating in my early to mid forties but I'll still have at least another 20 years of working left so it's worth it to me.\n\nWe aren't on other people's paths, we're on our own.",

You still have all the information you got from the rest of your life. \n\nRegret comes from thinking you could have taken other options but that\u2019s really shallow thinking. Kids on a multiple choice question get the wrong answer and shout \u201cI knew that\u201d but the proof is their actions, they didn\u2019t actually know. You might have recognized it as a choice but you failed to understand you disqualified the choice because you didn\u2019t know. Essentially you\u2019re using what you learned from these experiences to judge yourself unfairly. \n\nYour version of \u201csuccess\u201d is really poor given that you define it only on money, career, marriage, and things that you can have and still feel the same way you do right now. All success is is trying to go forward towards a proper aim, not necessarily having attained said aim.",

I did this.... and let me tell you, a lot of the \"successful kids\" I compared my self at twenty something were lost at 30. Two guys married at 24 and 25, divorced by 30... another, with a great university  degree never practiced his career... too many examples. ..\nSo, like someone said earlier: you aren't on other people paths \n\n-And second! You already did something amazing!\nYou Stepped out of your comfort zone and sheltered life and experience the world. That my friend is experience! And it builds your character. \nPs: sorry for my poor english. Best of luck!",

I stayed at a podsharw for three weeks and then found an apartment. It takes courage, resilience, and a positive attitude to accomplish any change.",

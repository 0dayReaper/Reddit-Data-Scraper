            "comment": "The pitfall of delayed gratification is that you risk forgetting when to stop and just enjoy your accomplishments (even the tiny ones). The difference between buying nice things + watching Netflix vs. mindfulness, exercise, etc is that the former don't scale up, even though both categories are supposed to be pleasing. So don't be harsh on yourself when you want to grow. Don't hold back intermediary excitement and rewards only because you haven't reached \"the goal\". Otherwise you will chase wild geese in an unhappy \"productiveness\" spiral.\n\nEdit: mistake",

Once we achieve any set goal, we are already going to start working on the next. And there is no one moment where it's \"aha- I'm healed!\" because life is ever changing. We are always going to be having high highs and low lows, always going to be creating new goals for ourselves, so it is very important we do appreciate those small moments of pleasure (be it TV, a snack, walking your dog, wearing perfume) in addition to the self reflection, meditation, and improvement we do. \n\nIt really is about the journey!!

We can learn something from everyone from all walks of life. Fortunate or destitute. It's when we think our accolades are better than others that we fall into the trap wrong thinking. There is no reward for being having to be right all the time. So yes, and sorry for the wrong winded response.",

But the minute you try to define what self-love looks like for others, or that other people have to do it your way, you've officially crossed the line into being a dick. \n\nGenerally speaking, we're at our best when we're positive. Multiple studies show this. There's a whole field out there called positive psychology. Self-love is about finding that place of positivity for you. It's about finding that positive mindset that let's you be the best version of yourself. \n\nGetting yourself the occasional treat, especially as a reward for accomplishing a goal or even picking yourself up out of the dirt when things go badly is completely valid. Taking time to rest &amp; recover is also not only valid, but necessary. \n\nYour mind isn't so different from your body. You wouldn't ask a habitually sedentary person to go out and run a marathon. You might well actually kill them. Same for things like productivity &amp; discipline. These are skills that need to be built, practiced, &amp; honed. They don't come pre-built into the brain. \n\nIt's even possible to over-train the mind the same way it is the body. We generally refer to this as burn-out.\n\nTLDR if you've found something that works for you, that's awesome. Telling people they have to do it your way, or insisting that only your way is the truth, is a bit of a dick move.",

I work hard for my goals but when i feel like shit i let myself feel like shit and do nothing. Just listen to your body and mind, it always knows what it needs, but be real with yourself always. And it's always about balance. Let yourself enjoy little things and accomplishments, celebrate yourself. We're not here for a long time, enjoy everything and make beautiful life for yourself whatever that means for you",

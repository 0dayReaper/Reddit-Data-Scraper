    "postText": "So I'm a guy and I'm having a hard time opening up to my therapist and he knows it. I think a big reason is simply that I generally feel uncomfortable with talking about feelings and the like, especially when it comes to the really intimate things I'm extra guarded about.\n\nI guess most men feel this way, due to society telling us to \"man up\" and claiming we're not allowed to have any feelings aside from anger and lust. I personally don't even buy into the whole thing about toxic masculinity.\n\nI'm perfectly fine talking about emotions and my deepest most personal secrets with people online, mainly due to the anonymity that's provided here. But when it comes to opening up to people in real life, I just can't do it.\n\nHeck, I can't even bring myself to tell my therapist about exactly these things I'm talking about right here in this post. I'm tempted to just give him a link so he can read the post rather than telling him personally.",

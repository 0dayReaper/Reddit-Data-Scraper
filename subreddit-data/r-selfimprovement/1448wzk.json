    "postText": "Anyone else a slow person? I am a slow person. I think, learn and do things slowly, I have been such a person my whole life and believe that it's just a part of who I am. I really hate being a slow person, it makes me feel inferiour and hate myself when seeing others do things much faster than me. I could say it's an insecurity of mine. People often think I am stupid because of that even through I am not, I have taken cognitive tests and didn't score low. I also believe to have ADD, was diagnosed when I was 6 years old. Went recently to a psychiatrist and she believed that I don't have it, I believe she is wrong. I tend to loose focus often too, many people think I do it on purpouse when they tell me something and I zone out even though I really do try to focus, but just can't. I try to get enough sleep every night, I eat healthy, I exercise regullary, I try to avoid social media, yet I still can't focus well and think faster.\n\nHow do you people who are also slow deal with your slowness? I've heard many people recommend meditation as a way to help with focus which I want to do (haven't been consistant on it due to lack of disciplin). What about thinking faster? Any suggestions?",

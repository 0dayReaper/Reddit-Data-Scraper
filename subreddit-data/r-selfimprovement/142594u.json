    "postText": "The job I work in I have a lot of down time and I spend it watching movies and tv shows. Now looking back on it I've spent years just wasting time watching movies/yt instead of trying to learn new skills etc. I've tried to start learning courses recently but somehow I always end up watching Netflix or YouTube. I've had issues with this since I was younger and it's part of why I dropped out of college. I need to fix this problem asap",

If you want to break that cycle and focus on learning new skills, here's a cool suggestion: check out the Forfeit app. It's this app where you set tasks for yourself and if you don't send an evidence completing them, you lose some cash. It's like having a personal motivator that keeps you on track.\r  \n\r  \nSo, set specific goals for your learning journey and use the Forfeit app to hold yourself accountable. Make a schedule that includes dedicated time for learning and stick to it. And remember, it's all about progress, not perfection. Even if you slip up sometimes and end up binging a show, just get back on track the next day and keep going.\r  \n\r  \nWith a little discipline, you'll be able to break free from the Netflix and YouTube cycle and start focusing on building those awesome new skills. Good luck, my friend!",

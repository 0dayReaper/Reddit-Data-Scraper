I can\u2019t look in people eyes\n4. I think that every other guy is better than me, and they will take my girlfriend from me\n5. I\u2019m afraid of fighting\n6. I can\u2019t be social, just can\u2019t, but I love communicating with people, I just don\u2019t know what to say\n\nAnd etc\n\nI did everything I could\n\n1. Training\n2. Reading books\n3.

            "comment": "The first thing I would say is to understand that you're not alone in this. It can compound the self esteem issues if you then think 'is it just me that feels like this?' - you are not alone. I think a lot of people will relate to at least one of the points on your list, including me. In your list, you've very clearly split 'you' and 'everyone else' - but many, many people feel the same and will not be judging you.\n\nSecondly, it looks like you've already tried a few things and so I'd just like to congratulate you on that. Often with trying to address mental health/wellbeing difficulties the biggest step is the first one. \n\nA key element to all of this is trying to understand the root causes. How was growing up? Were you bullied? How was the home life, were you supported or did you often find yourself denigrated or in competition with siblings or peers? Has there been a trauma relating to you 'getting something wrong', and being belittled, laughed at or hurt? Is the self esteem connected to other struggles like with depression or anxiety? Do you have encouraging friends and family? You obviously don't have to answer these but trying to get into the weeds of it all can be helpful, if challenging.\n\nUltimately though you want to try and get to a place where you can understand that you have value, and worth, as much as everyone else. Maybe you haven't yet found an outlet or a hobby or interest that you truly feel yourself doing. Keep looking and keep trying. You're doing great. \n\nYou may never ever fully get over your self esteem issues, but by exploring the what and the why you will hopefully know when it's flaring up and can just give yourself a few kind words and move on...\n\nJust some thoughts! Take care.",

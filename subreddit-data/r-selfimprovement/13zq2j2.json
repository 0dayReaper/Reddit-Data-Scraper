Genetically I\u2019m ugly being 5\u20197 and brown. Got bullied so much in high school I ate my feelings away and become obese and never learned game or made good friends.\n\nNow I\u2019m the least accomplished 25 yo in America. I somehow have a doctorate, which doesn\u2019t matter nowadays. Only thing that brings me joy is I have a job where I can go far and move up and all my coworkers have big expectations and I haven\u2019t even started. \n\nMy hobbies like cooking and volunteering bring temporary joy. But women want badass guys who aren\u2019t short and fat, they don\u2019t want a cooking loser. \n\nAgain 5\u20197 25 yo M virgin who\u2019s Indian and fat. I\u2019m staying at home this year so I can save up money to spend on a trainer, dietician, therapist. I\u2019m not gonna let my genetics define me, I\u2019m gonna get fit mentally and physically but again women don\u2019t like brown guys. Brown women want white guys so their kids end up less brown. \n\nAgain my life is over. I\u2019ve spent all of today writing down instructions for my funeral. If something in my life doesn\u2019t change by my bday, I\u2019m ending it.",

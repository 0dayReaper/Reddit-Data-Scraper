    "postText": "I'm a short- tempered person. I get irritated when my younger sister (she's literally 6 and I'm 15) disturbs me or pokes her nose into what I'm doing, I quickly lose patience and hit her hard in places I shouldn't (head, chest). My mother tells me not to do that but I just can't control my anger when that situation arises. What should I do",

            "comment": "Your anger arises because you are prioritizing your own time and focus over someone else\u2019s interests\u2014 to the point of devaluing human life and violence.\n\nAnd your sister likely is internalizing or will internalize it as a teaching, that she is not worth her own life because of your disregard and violence.\n\nYou don\u2019t fully understand the implications of your actions or habits. \n\nYou\u2019re not a thoughtful person.\n\nIf your sister believes a teaching that she isn\u2019t worth her life she will likely suffer further from depression and may end her life.\n\nLearning and practicing patience, compassion, and understanding is something that someone would do if they were motivated enough by the facts.",

            "comment": "Try to empathize with her, she is your little sister that looks up to you both literally and Figuratively. \rYou are normalizing this behavior for her as a loved one in her life. \rBeing young she doesn't understand fully what's happening and why you are acting in such a way towards her.\n\n\rAlso think what if you really do hurt her one day and can't take it back.It only takes one good hit to the head to become fatal.\rIf you can't control this behaviour one day it could be you on the receiving end.\n\n\rSeperate yourself from her when you become upset. \rFind an outlet for your frustration like putting your mattress to the wall and punching that, or see about taking up boxing. \rIf you are in a position of being able to see a therapist, psychologist or counsellor to help with your anger management, I would suggest that as well. Hope that your anger issues aren't stemming from past trauma that you have faced. We all have our issues and all should try to better ourselves.",

I\u2019m working on it day after day. My brother was abusive and I hate my brother to this day and haven\u2019t spoken his name in 10 years.

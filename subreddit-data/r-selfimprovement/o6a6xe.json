So when you say \"nobody\" I have to disagree. You're right, nobody is happy with their bad habits or circumstances, but many people stop fighting them because they've been fighting for a long time and they want to give up, or they stop fighting because they're lazy, or whatever reason we may perceive as \"good\" or \"bad\", it happens.\n\n&gt;And doomsaying about the dire consequences of the fact that you aren\u2019t there yet won\u2019t actually help anybody.

You're gonna have to do an awful lot of work to see the results of your efforts at all. You could put in 95% of the needed work to succeed before really seeing a change. And if you weren't careful, and to outsiders, it might seem like that last little bit at the end was what really made the difference. But it wasn't any kind of overnight success, it was a long process full of hardship, sweat, grinding, trying different things and failing at some along the way. \n\nPersonal development and getting unstuck from depression or any kind of rut is like this, but sometimes even more obscure with less feedback and metrics. But don't compare your struggle - which could be 95% and just about to really and visibly pay off - with the tail end, the last 5% of the work of other people's successes. KEEP GOING.",

If you succeed, all's the better, if not, you enjoyed yourself along the way, gained some insights, made friends etc. A positive outlook is necessary.\n\nSometimes, it's enough to say \"I had to try, and I did, and I'm glad I did.\"",

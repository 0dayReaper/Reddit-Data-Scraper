I say that cause i use a motivational app called forfeit and it is bulletproof on my self improvement journey, and i\u00b4ll definitely keep using it until i feel there\u00b4s no need anymore. Btw, the premise of the app is pretty cool, i need to send an evidence completing a task or i lose money, if you need motivation is a great tool. But to keep it brief, there\u00b4s no issue in using productivity apps!",

    "postText": "Long story short, I grew up in an environment where it didn't matter how well you did, if you weren't at the top then it was all meaningless. Sure, it instilled discipline and whatnot but it also robbed me of my self-esteem. \n\nI don't feel like I have any inherent value unless I can be in a position where no one looks down on me, or is better than me and that's just not possible in such a big world. \n\nI don't consume self improvement content as much really but when I see people improving their lives, it makes me feel awful. Angry, frustrated. I could have the most perfect day but if I see a self improvement youtuber on my recommended I will seethe and wish death upon them. I'll turn that anger into frustration and study more, read more, workout more. Just be more productive through any means. \n\nI've burned myself out multiple times, and anytime I'm taking a break I keep binging self improvement and thinking that while I'm resting, people are getting ahead of me. Maybe I need therapy. I had a a narcissistic parent and I feel like some of that manifested in me. I compensate for my lack of self worth by being above others, but how else do you prove yourself?\n\nI don't really have any friends because even though I can maintain outward friendliness, I don't like to see people doing well for themselves. I also simultaneously detest people who waste away their lives so I just isolate myself from people and dedicate myself to climbing closer to the top in every aspect of life that I could, or what I value useful. Maybe I don't want to get rid of it but I want to temper this mentality where I have to drag others down to be happy with myself.",

There will always be people who are ahead of you financially, career wise, health wise and relationship wise.  Gratitude for what you have is the best antidote.  Recognize many people probably look at you and similarly feel inferior in some aspects of themselves.",

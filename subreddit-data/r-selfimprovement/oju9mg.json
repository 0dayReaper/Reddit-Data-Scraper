Can you give yourself a hot bath to calm your nerves and help you sleep? Maybe put away a few dishes just so they don't stress you out in the morning?\n\nYou don't have to do a lot. I just wanted to remind you that you can grab one win right now if you want to, even if the rest of your day sucked. Even one small win can make a bad day a bit more tolerable.",

                    "comment": "There\u2019s a book, I think it\u2019s called *Willpower* and while the book is okay IMO, the most basic principle of it is that if you want to make something a habit, simply remove the decision making process from doing that thing. \n\nFor example, if you want to make your bed every morning before you do anything, then you simply make it a rule. Not \u201cohh after I\u2019ve had my coffee\u201d, not \u201cI\u2019ll just get some work done first then focus on myself.\u201d By making it a rule with no decision making process, you use less energy to think about it / accomplish it. Throughout the day this energy adds up.\n\nI\u2019ve found this principle to be incredibly useful in my life and not necessarily for \u201cself improvement\u201d things. It helps you to ritualize your actions. Went mountain biking? Wipe down the chain, store your helmet, etc etc before you put the bike in the garage. It\u2019s what you do when you mountain bike, you don\u2019t have the option of not doing this thing. Cooked? Clean the dishes after\u2026 etc \n\nThere\u2019s another book, *Getting Things Done* which has a variety of systems, some a little complex, about how to be productive. I can\u2019t really speak to the quality of the book/system, but there is one rule that I have found incredibly useful:\n\n&gt; If it takes less than 2 minutes to do, then do it now.\n\nWant to send a quick text to a loved one? Just do it. Missed your workout? Just bang out some push-ups. Often I find that usually what I need is a catalyst to get started. Well, this just do it, do it now mentality has helped me so many times to just get started with something that leads me to finishing the task/project in the first place. It\u2019s also a huge help for me in handling chores and stuff because I can rationalize how quick it will take, like \u201coh it will literally take me 90 seconds to load up the dishwasher\u201d or whatever. \n\nAnyway I think to OP\u2019s point, you can always salvage your day and your time. If you\u2019re on a diet and ate cupcakes for breakfast, you can always eat healthier for your later meals. And if you have wasted your day you can potentially save some of your goals by saying \u201cwell, I don\u2019t have a choice, I have to ____\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll just get this one thing done because it will be so quick.\u201d Great tip, OP.",

With each purpose there are a bunch of things that you need to learn, do them and when you get to your next purpose learn the things that you need to learn for it.",

To determine where to start, try prioritizing based on a few factors.\r First, consider your long-term goals and aspirations. Think about which skills or areas of improvement align most closely with what you want to achieve in the future.\r Next, assess the immediate needs or challenges in your life. Is there a particular skill or area that could have the biggest impact on addressing those challenges or improving your current situation?\r Additionally, consider your personal interests and passions. Prioritizing something you genuinely enjoy and are enthusiastic about can provide a boost in motivation and make the learning process more enjoyable.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, there's no right or wrong answer here. You can always adjust and shift your focus as you go along. The most important thing is to take that first step and get started. And if you need an extra push to stay committed, you can check out the Forfeit app. It's a neat tool that adds a bit of accountability by attaching a small monetary forfeit to tasks you set for yourself.",

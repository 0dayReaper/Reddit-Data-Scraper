    "postText": "Being harsh or mean will not help me in any way and I'm not in a good place.\n\nPlease understand that I have tried my best to conduct myself in a way where I dont cause unnecessary pain to others. I have tried to be as opened and considerate of everyone as possible . I've tried to be as fair as I can. To a fault.  As those are the traits I genuinely hate about myself .\n\nI don't know where to go from here. I spent years recovering from a very psychologically toxic relationship, only to get into a situationship  that is now a serious relationship and that has been like experiencing thousands of paper cuts overtime. I've spent a long time in therapy , and now looking back I feel everything I was told was not very useful. I literally feel like the therapists must've thought I was born yesterday. I spent so much time basically being directed away from figuring out the core of my issues , and just being told to cope with it. I don't want to cope with where I'm at any more. I'm so damn tired and coping stops working after a while . I want to be someone else completely , somewhere else .\n\nAnd I've tried so fucking hard.\nI worked up the courage to try and end this relationship, and move out of my hometown , only to get back into it again, realize that the state I moved to doesn't have as much to offer me as I was convinced by therapy , and by others around me, and as I had truly hoped.\n\nThe relationship that I am in now is not terrible . My boyfriend is a good person and he's trying his best to love me , but I've come to realize we are extremely different. He was raised in a family where being mean and insulting eachother and kind of just having rude humor is normal. I am from a family where any minor fucking disagreement with my parents was met with physical discipline or intense yelling and punishment. \n\nI know he loves me and wants the best for me but being with him really does feel like I'm getting 1,000 paper cuts sometimes . I have to remind him often , that if he's gonna joke around with me it can't always be 100% derogatory, and that I can't really feel good about myself if he says stuff that makes me feel like much less than the person I am trying to be. And it's like he understands , but his behavior is kind of muscle memory . I know it might be hard to believe he's a good boyfriend from that description, but please trust me, he's not a bad person and he's not trying to hurt me. He just kind of thinks that thing is normal.\n\nI don't know what to do because we've had some pretty intense ups and downs and I've broken up with him and gone back a few times. I feel like he truly has cared for me in ways that I really needed , but at the same time the way our entire relationship started and the first year of it was really hard on me. He was doing things that made me feel used and hurt and confused , to protect himself , and he was kind of okay with it being at my expense . We've talked about it a lot and he understands why it was wrong now and things are alot better .\n\nBut now  he's putting in so much more effort after his actions caused me so much hurt and confusion, that I kinda lost the spark. I don't really want to be with anyone. I feel very cynical about relationships and human connection in general . I fundamentally just want to be alone . But I do enjoy his company . I do enjoy our relationship but at the same time it serves as a reminder of how far away I am from being the person I want to be. I can't help feeling just bad about how it all started , and I just wish I had something different. \n\n I just feel like I really wish I could have some thing  where the person I was with didn't make me feel used for a whole year , and doesn't say things that make me unsure of myself now. I give up on finding that though.\n\n The universe has never brought me any kind of close human connection that didn't fuck me over or hurt me deeply . So I give up on connection. I want to be alone. I want to train myself to be alone , and cold so I can stop being considerate of people who would never do the same for me. \n\nI just don't know what to do about this situation. I feel like it's contributing to how I feel like I'll never be able to become the person I want to be. He likes me for how nice and considerate I try to be. But I hate that part of me , because it's the part of me that caused every situation where I've been deceived and controlled by someone. \n\nI feel lost . I have to go back to my home town. Ive come to the realization that the life and the love that I truly want and need just won't come. I honestly don't even want to be here. \n\n\nI don't want to leave him, but at the same time , I feel like I want to be alone. I feel like relationships are nothing but pain.  I feel sad in ways with him. I know he's trying his best to love me, but I am just hurt a lot .\n\nAnd that makes me feel weak. And in trying so hard to not be anymore . I'm trying to kill the part of me that automatically responds with compassion &amp; understanding, and I know that seems like a good trait to have, but it literally only gets me hurt and used. It's never resulted in anything good for me.  I just don't want to hurt anymore",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not sure if you like movies, but If you do, there is a movie named \u201cFord Vs Ferrari\u201d that tells the story of how a team at Ford made a race car that beat Ferrari at a famous race. I recommend you watch it if you haven\u2019t seen it.\n\nIn the movie, what gives the drivers from Ford the edge to win is that they were able to build the car that they were racing. Therefore they knew the car inside and out.\n\nWhat will give you the love and peace you are looking for is not being alone, but rather to know yourself from the inside out. Not the you that you described in your post. In your post you only spoke about what you think. I\u2019m referring to the you that you are, absent of any thinking. \n\nNotice this: how would you feel if you had nothing on your mind? The word for this feeling is peace.\n\nSo then, if your \u201cdefault setting\u201d is nothing on your mind, then peace is your natural state. \n\nWhen you are feeling used, hurt, angry, it\u2019s because you are thinking about stories that make you feel these ways. If you never made up these stories then you would just feel peace.\n\nThe solution is not to stop thinking or change your thinking. The solution is to understand what is happening. The understanding is what resolves this issue all on its own.\n\nIt\u2019s like once you understand the shadows on your wall are not monsters, but just reflections of the tree outside, they are not scary anymore and you can sleep peacefully even in the same room that was once filled with monsters.\n\n\ud83d\ude42",

This doggy-paddling around this lake of life is getting fucking **old***. I\u2019m in my 40s and tired as fuck. Is there a sandbar or something where I can rest? Lol. Hang in there, internet stranger!\n\n\nIf you want advice, I have two suggestions that have helped me. 1) Movement is medicine! Move your body is any way, shape, or form. Walk in place, swing your arms, train for a triathlon, take up ballroom dancing, go play at a local park (swinging and sliding are really fun!), walk around your couch, ride a bicycle, see how long you can balance on one foot\u2026so many options! And you can do movement in any increment - five minutes at a time, all at once, push-ups during commercials, 15 lunges every hour, hold a squat while brushing your teeth\u2026again, so many options! Suggestion 2) Helping others makes me feel good. Consider volunteering in your community. Maybe a local animal shelter/rescue, food pantry, library, etc. A good place to start is a local United Way office because they work non-profits and organizations that have been vetted. I was a teen mom who benefited greatly from the services of United Way agencies, and numerous individuals who donated their time and money to these organizations. It feels good to give back, and give people the same opportunities that helped me get through a tough chapter of my life. \n\n\nHey OP, hang in there! You don\u2019t have to doggy-paddle forever!",

Have you cooked yourself a nice, planned meal?\n\nYou are either going to need radical change, or radical acceptance. But let me ask you this... arent you tired of hurting? At least part of you is crying out for change because you are here. The path you are on is making you miserable. Take a chance... you have nothing to lose. You could be a completely different person if 6 months....\n\nif you wanted to be.",

You can go to all the therapy you want and listen to the best psychologists, if you don't actively participate and try to change something, it will never get better.\n\nI also struggle with depression, but I'm just tired of it yk? Why do I not like my body, why do I not like my behavior? What can I change?\n\nTogether with my therapist I made an action plan and have started to run and already lost a few kgs. \n\nSelf improvement is easily, if you start and stick with it. If you give up after trying it once nothing will change. These processes take months to build up a habit and maybe even longer to see strong results, but every miniscule improvement makes it worth it and betters your self esteem",

You'll be distracting yourself from selfpity/selfloathing while doing something productive.\n\nThe cheesy and old saying \"the journey is better than destination\" rings true though. I was living the same way as you and then I decided to change things up and set goals. Looking back I was actually confident in my self and with a lack of better words \"happy\" while I was going after them.\nA while later I achieved the goals and fell back in to the same rut and fell arguably worse, because I felt the same feelings while I was living in a completely different way.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is to set goals, and keep setting new goals.",

            "comment": "It can be hard to break out of such deeply ingrained patterns of thought and beliefs without help. Working with a really good therapist helped put me on the right track.\n\nPsychedelic-assisted therapy (with psilocybin or ketamine) has been shown in preliminary studies to be more effective at treating depression than other pharmaceutical treatments available, perhaps it could benefit you if it is in fact depression that you're dealing with?\n\nIn any case, I believe these experiences to be a necessary part of our journey as they force us to awaken and make a change and they put us on the path to living more consciously. \n\nI am able to look back at such a period in my life with gratitude that it happened as it is what put me on this spiritual path that I'm on and led me to where I am today. \n\nThe book that triggered my spiritual awakening was The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle. Some more good resources are: The Michael Singer Podcast (I imagine his books are great too but haven't read them), The Secular Buddhist podcast (Noah Rasheta distills the wisdom from Buddhist teachings and conveys them in a non-secular, relatable way), The Voice of Knowledge by Miguel Ruiz, The High Five Habit by Mel Robins, Vipassana (did a 10-day course that completely changed the way I experience life).\n\nOne thing that you must realise is that the reason you believe life sucks is because you believe it to be so. Our subconscious beliefs about ourselves and the world shape our perception and experience of the world. In order to truly change we must learn what self-limiting beliefs we hold and work on changing them. In order to do that you must become aware of your thoughts and the sensations in your body. Observe how you move through life, how you react to things. Be inquisitive and introspective. A tool to help with this is The Work by Byron Katie.\n\nI truly hope that you find your way out of this dark place so that you can experience the beauty of life.\n\nSending you love,\nMike &lt;3",

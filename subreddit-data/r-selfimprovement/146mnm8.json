I'm unsure if you know what you want to do, but there may be another path for you regardless, don't give up. I know how you feel. I've been there. I dropped out of college twice; my first two cars got wrecked before I could drive them, and my last car\u2019s engine cracked before I even made it to a year (I still don't have my license). I took a break from school after being on stage 2 probation, but when I returned, I started getting As. Although I'm taking fewer classes and created a few businesses along the way, some failed. I made a ton of money and also lost it all, got depressed, gained weight, got out of the depression, started losing weight, and it goes on and on. Still, I'm figuring out that there's no rush to find a way to be happy now. Make your basic needs are met, and then pick up a hobby, talk to friends and family, go out, have fun, make memories, and take your time. It's about the journey, not the destination. No matter what, as long as you keep working on your dreams without giving up, you'll get there, but often people say they miss how things were before they reached their goals. Don't be so hard on yourself! Life is better when you spend less time worrying and more time living.",

    "postText": "So i have been taking violin lessons since i was in 2nd grade. for the last 2/3 years my practice has been very minimal/nonexistent. i understand it is a very big problem but i cant seem to motivate myself to practice or i always just push it aside. i know this needs to stop but how can reduce procrastination and increase motivation?",

Practice isn't always thrill a minute, but I'm sure you will be less rusty once you get back into it. If practice feels stale, try incorporating something new or more challenging.",

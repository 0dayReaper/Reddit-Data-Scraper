I also make youtube videos (mainly roblox), I started at 14, but stopped for a while. I love making youtube videos, and I think it'll be cool to stream one day, but thinking about my age holds me back. I go to college and I have a job, but I can't help but think it's a bit childish and it brings my mood down.",

The other guys in my class played Minecraft.\n\n\nEveryone our age grew up playing Minecraft. Big name  30 year old YouTubers and Streamers also play Minecraft. At this point, if anyone judges you for playing Minecraft then they\u2019re just some miserable fuck stuck in the Stone Age.",

But society is depressed as hell because of that. \n\nIf it's a hobby that you enjoy and sparks you up, there is nothing wrong with that. Roblox has a lot of interesting things in the game to make streaming a very fun activity. \n\nAll-in-all, just don't worry about what others say about it. People will complain and have judgments over anything and everything. It's just sadly human nature. Just have fun and keep killing it on the game and enjoy your time with it.:)",

            "comment": "You're thinking that way because it is childish. The reason why you're trying to convince yourself otherwise is because everyone else considers it perfectly acceptable today to spend their time playing videogames as an adult. Same as they consider it acceptable to destroy their health through junk food and other things.\n\nNo responsible adult would behave in such a way. I think everyone knows that deep down. I've wasted a majority of my life on videogames and I'm not gonna pretend that it was anything but a waste of time. You know that there's better things you could use your time on and that life is not just about having fun. But the child in you might disagree. And in today's world the child inside is controlling most adults. Many people never grow up because there's just no more need to do so. Do what you're told like a good boy or girl for 8+ hours at work, then you're free to do whatever you want afterwards. Which likely means \"have fun\" because nothing else matters anyway.\n\nBut here's something you can try that should give you some perspective. Imagine your ideal life. What would you do if you could do literally anything you want. No limitations whatsoever, within reason of course. I'm sure there's plenty of celebrities you know that live a pretty cool life, being able to do whatever they want. Would you really rather spend your time playing videogames when you could do literally anything else? For me the answer is obvious. But if your ideal life would still consist of you spending hours each day playing games, then I guess that's what you should do as you're living the dream. And if it also happens to include working  a job as well, then you seem to really have a hard time imagining a better life. Or you are indeed living the dream in every regard. Either way, use that as your signpost for what to aim for in life. Not what you feel like doing right now. The latter usually comes from the immature, irresponsible part of you that would rather spend the rest of its life on distractions than to try and create the life you really want to live.",

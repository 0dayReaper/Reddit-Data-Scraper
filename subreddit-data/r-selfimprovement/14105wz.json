    "postText": "hi there :] i'm trying to save money but i just cant seem to stop blowing checks. i still live at home as i just turned 20 but i'm trying to save to move out. i recently had to go to the ER ($350) and my car now needs $150 in repairs and it was kind of a slap in the face that i need to stop feeling so comfortable wasting money. \n\nwhen i'm bored, anxious, stressed, or just need to get away from my family (every day) i always leave the house and go wander around stores or get coffee. i don't need any of the things i end up getting but will neglect basic food/necessities. how can i improve this in myself!?",

If you have a close by park or area that has walking or hiking trails, I highly recommend making use of it! \n  Even getting into the gym or an activity like indoor rock climbing or dance class or a music or language lesson can be a distraction from \u201cwandering expenses\u201d. It will also provide you with new skills and help you meet people. \n   If you have your own bank account and savings account: set up an automatic payment to your savings! Work out how much you\u2019re able to save per check while still being able to afford necessities. You might want to have more than one savings account. One for car expenses, one for medical, one for general saving. Even a little bit per paycheck adds up eventually.",

I get it, the fact that you even want to improve is great. \n\nBelow is what worked for me, I wouldn't say I'm \"successful\" yet, but I've got my finances together.\n\nYou need to learn what money is, what it means to your life. Just start by watching personal finance videos on youtube or go to r/personalfinance or r/financialindependence. I would go to r/bogleheads and read the wiki and follow every step.",

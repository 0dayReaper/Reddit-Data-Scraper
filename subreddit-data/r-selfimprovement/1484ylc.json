But tbh i was a lil weird even do i got rejected I kept following her begging to get unblocked and trying to talk to her and i even kept touching her (not in a inappropriate way) she even had her female friends protect me from her but i still kept going she even slapped me and kicked me herself to get me away from her. She called the dean on me once but i asked her the next day again why she called the dean on me and was tryna be less weird but she still wanted me to get away from her and threatened to call the dean again which she did i couldn\u2019t go to the classes i had with her today\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. She even told me i cant even look at her \ud83d\ude14. Im really broken down by this im really attracted to her I probably wont come back from this until im 19  in 2 years ( i dont want no other girl) \ud83d\udc94.

Nothing absolutely nothing about it is okay.\r  \n\r  \nIt's absolutely disrespectful behavior towards her. You're making her life hell because she literally doesn't know what else you would do.\r  \nYou've learned what you can't and shouldn't do.\r  \nDon't speak to her!\r  \nDon't go near her!",

It\u2019s hard to have those strong feelings and be brutally rejected, then everyone despises you. Life is really screwed up. People are really screwed up. The thing is, I bet this hurt you more than it did for her, yet everyone sympathizes with the girl. But stalking her did make it worse. \n\nConclusion, I am sorry for how heartbreaking this is for you, and don\u2019t stalk someone if they reject you. You don\u2019t seem like an evil person with bad intentions, just heartbroken and confused for what to do about it. Since this hurt you more than the girl, people should be more sympathetic towards you. This guy already suffered enough, why add to it? Life has brutally tortured you. Screw everyone that makes the suffering worse by being oblivious to his feelings.",

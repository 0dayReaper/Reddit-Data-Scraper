I know you love having an excuse to wallow in self-pity, but in the grand scheme of your life, your early twenties often don't matter. You want your life to progress and change? Work at it! It takes time, it's normal. You need to learn to appreciate the journey, or you'll always be miserable. Find what you love, make a plan, make friends, take care of your loved ones, and have fun. You're doing just fine.",

From my 18-21 did one shit job after another and in the weekends partied a lot a drank away half my low earnings. On paper a total failure and that's also how I felt at the time.\n\nBut looking back at it (I'm in my 30s now) those years were actually very productive for introverted me. I was forced to socialize and meet new people a lot because of all the job hopping, not to mention all the interviewing. In the weekends I was able to go out of my comfort zone because alcohol.\n\nIt has really helped me develop my social skills. Not to mention expand my understanding of the world. I know so many people that barely changed employers, let alone types of jobs and fields of work. Some of them are totaly clueless about how it is to be a retail or factory worker.\n\nLuckily I live in socialist Belgium and was able to finish my studies a bit later in my twenties.",

I\u2019m in my late 30s, am happy with my career and health (knock on wood) and my early twenties were awful. My family (parents and sibling) was evicted from our home, and I lost both my parents within 14 months before I was 26, and all I was left with was 2 funerals to pay for. Things continued to be tough until my late 20s and then it all tuned around in like a 4 year period. None of this is meant to be boastful (dunno how much credit I can take for it anyway), just anecdotal evidence to my point. Even if your late twenties are filled with missteps, setbacks beyond your control, whatever, you can bounce back FAST (relatively speaking) with some maturity and prudence. I once worked for a guy who had this saying: good judgment comes from bad experience, and bad experience comes from bad judgment.",

That, plus a degree in writing stories made me about as employable as the average fruit bat.\n\nWhich meant: if I wanted anything but a few decades of misery before dying in a ditch, somewhere, I had to choose my own adventure.  I was a little lucky, because that era was kind of a boom era for Internet growth, meaning DIY opportunities and early-generation side hustles were everywhere, AND they weren't yet completely overwhelmed by generations who grew up already having no other hope or plan.",

It's amazing that you are recognizing you're not comfortable with how things are going for you.\n\nMake a list of the things you want to have accomplished by the time you turn 30. It could be more serious, financial and professional accomplishments, or it could be just bucket list type stuff. Whatever gets your emotions involved though is what you want to pay attention to. Then you can start learning how other people have accomplished what you want to accomplish, and try out different ways. You could also draw on your current life experience to identify your inclinations, personality traits, and personal identity and use these things to help narrow down what paths you will try to accomplish your goals. keep on reaching out for help and getting people's insight even if it's only through the internet because it can be really easy to get tunnel vision.\n\nIf I were talking to my 24-year-old self I would say start learning how to manage and prevent panic attacks now, so that if you ever experience one you are not as traumatized because you know what to do. start to value and respect money. And you don't have to be best personal friends with someone in order to have a meaningful and impactful connection with them.",

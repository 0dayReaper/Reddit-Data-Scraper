    "postText": "In November I looked into myself deeply for the first time in a few years. I saw someone I was ashamed of and it killed me. \n\nI saw a girl who was deathly afraid of being alone, constantly seeking approval and letting others take advantage of her. I was a slave to other peoples words and emotions. I let other people control me and my mood. I hadn\u2019t been in control for years and realizing this felt like I had died. I lacked confidence in who I was, In my thoughts and when I speak. I never stood up for myself in fear of conflict or losing people. \n\nI decided it was over. I was never going to be this person again. That person died and I mourned the loss then and there. I cried it out for a while. I made a google doc documenting the process of rebuilding myself completely, going into depth about my flaws and what to do about it. I started therapy again. I got a gym membership and I\u2019m already seeing improvement. I\u2019m meditating and reading books. I repeat affirmations to myself often. \u201cI am healthy. I\u2019m not taking anyone\u2019s shit. I am kind. I say no. I am loving. I am determined.\u201d I\u2019m only barely getting to know myself deeply, but I love her and we\u2019re changing for the better. \n\nMy life is permanently changed. \n\nI am set free.",

I found myself letting things happen that I didn\u2019t want or agreeing to things I didn\u2019t want. And the relationship itself was triggering a lot of my OCD.

Often times I would brush it off or ignore it, because I loved him blindly. I lost most if not all respect for myself and my confidence. It was terrible. I almost went insane. I knew it was all so wrong and so damaging, but I still stayed for \"love\" or whatever reason. Even when I was with him I felt so alone and so low. Finally, I have mustered up strength to say enough and leave, as far as I could, to another country. Best decision ever. I have spent the last 3 years licking out my wounds and struggling through severe depression, complete lack of motivation and hope, no confidence and bad self-image. I am better now, but wow how much time and energy and sanity that horrible relationship cost me. I am very wary of new people now and sometimes think I will be alone the rest of my life and that's quite fine by me, at least now.",

When I\u2019m in front of this hurdle, I can have a two different mindsets preparing me for this hurdle. For example, I could have spent a year telling myself I\u2019m not good enough, I\u2019m not smart, I don\u2019t have what it takes, etc. or - I\u2019ve spent a year catching these negative thoughts and replacing them with *genuine* self encouragement. So when I\u2019m standing in front of this hurdle, instead of my initial reaction of going into negative thoughts, I can instead react in a way I\u2019ve been practicing for a year and I can look back on every positive reinforcement I\u2019ve given myself to prepare for this hurdle. \n\nAlso, positive affirmations always should go hand in hand with your own effort.

I remember one quote from a sitcom wherein a person asks \u201cSo do I just have to pretend that I don\u2019t care ?\u201d To which the reply is \u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to care\u201d and that hit me. There is always this fine line where in I find myself fluctuating of being free and sometimes finding out that I am kind of pretending do be free. But I guess that is part of the process. You realise one day you stopped pretending and are actually free. I wish you the best of luck for your endeavours.",

It broke me for years. Like you I was afraid to ever speak my mind or stand up for myself I stayed powerless and helpless for years. Its really great you've started meditation and exercising. They can both be great tools for your mental health specially medication when you really dive in deep into yourself and your pain you carried for so long. It sounds like you shed what no longer served you and stepped into a new you. If you ever need to vent more, I'm happy to listen. Stay strong.",

Another issue with this sickness is that it makes you naturally attracted to narcissists because you can never please them but you\u2019ll keep trying till you\u2019re blue in the face. Try reading some books on it to get a better understanding codependent no more is a good one. Good for you for discovering this youll be much happier pushing this aside.",

I know it leads to traumatic experiences too, but it's undeniable that people can go the extra mile if someone else looks up to them or believes in them.",

It strikes when we get the first sense of achievement. Then we relax and become most vulnerable. Speaking from experience.\n\nI believe it will take longer than 3 months to change. 3 months is like a honeymoon period, the real challenge will probably begin now.

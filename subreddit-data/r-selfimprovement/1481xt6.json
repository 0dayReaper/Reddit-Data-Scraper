    "postText": "I have been going through a lot of ups and downs and this advice is what I often see people give.\n\nSaying, \"just be confident\" when someone is in a bad place is like telling someone to \"just be happy\" when they're dealing with a death of a loved one. It isn't a switch you can just flick on. \n\nIt's very natural to feel this way, and even the people who give advice like this probably lack confidence at times as well. \n\nWhat needs to happen is to improve aspects (that you have control over) of your life and yourself that are keeping you in a place where you aren't happy or satisfied. \n\nI hope this gives hope to people who feel bad about not being confident. It's a long process to reach, and the fact that you can't magically feel confident out of nowhere doesn't mean there's something wrong with you, it just means there's more to be done, whatever that may look like, which is normal. \n\nConfidence is not the solution, it's the prize.",

It's part of self awareness, so when someone isn't completely confident, they know there's something that needs to be worked on or improved. \n\nFor example, if 2 people who have never played a sport in their life were about to play a professional soccer match, the one who feels confident that they'll do great probably has less self awareness than the person who doesn't feel very confident about it.\n\nIt just means they have to practice and train to get good at soccer first so that confidence can be genuinely created for a justified reason, not out of ego.",

It's usually offered to people who want to work on how they're perceived by others. \n\nI, for example, have much more confidence when regarding taking care of myself and doing the things I need to do, but when it comes to attraction, finding friends, a partner, communicating with people, making a good impression, etc, I'm not as confident and have a lot of room to improve. I can't just be more confident than how I naturally feel, because I feel that way for a reason, and I need to work on those reasons, which can be a journey.",

No one sees you for you, but through the prism of their own experiences. Yet most people (and I am not immune to this) base their self image on their perception of how others perceive them. Confidence is stepping fully into yourself, allowing that not everyone is going to like you, and being okay with it. Because you like you.",

Some people aren't happy with where they are or who they are, and it takes a lot of work to improve that. One needs to have a reason to be confident in themselves, and it can't come out of nowhere in those cases where self improvement is necessary.",

I certainly did for ages.\n\nWhat I have discovered is most of us work backwards.  With happiness, with confidence,  with spirituality, all of it.\n\nPeople work from the frame of \"I'll be happy when I have that job\" or \"I'll be confident once I get the relationship\" and in my experience that's fleeting. We get the thing we want and then wonder why we don't feel the way we expected to. Happy people choose happiness first, no matter the circumstances. It doesn't mean they are always happy, but at the core of who they are they have a baseline of happiness.  This is something that can be practiced. Confidence is the same way.",

It\u2019s why we look back and think, \u201cif I\u2019d only been more confident\u2026\u201d\n\nMy advice would be: It\u2019s ok to fail. Get comfortable with failure. It\u2019s such an important part of life. Failing and trying again is the ONLY way to improve. Whether is handwriting or a book or talking to a pretty person, you\u2019ll never be successful 100% of the time. Try. Fail. Think of how you can improve. Try again. \n\nNot every pretty person will like you. But one will. You get the point. \n\nDon\u2019t be hard on others. Don\u2019t be hard on yourself. Be ok with failure. And keep trying.",

It's good to push yourself, but it takes a lot of work to get to the point where you are confident. It's like practicing for a sport. Just because you are practicing doesn't mean you're confident yet, but you're on the path to get there. Someone can't just tell you to be confident in your ability, but rather, it would make more sense to encourage you to go and earn that confidence by working on that skill.\n\nMe going to ask out a girl requires courage rather than confidence since I'd be going out of my comfort zone, but the more I do it, I'd hope the more confident I'd be eventually.",

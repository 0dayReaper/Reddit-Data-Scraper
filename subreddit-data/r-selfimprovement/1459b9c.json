    "postText": "I\u2019m a 29m who wants to improve his social skills as I currently have like 2 friends who I don\u2019t see often. I\u2019m married so just looking for group activities and stuff I\u2019m interested in. I\u2019m really not picky about anything, I love board games, chess, softball/baseball, self improvement, book clubs, hiking, tennis, yoga/tai chi. \n\nThe problem is, my current resources for finding social stuff are never that great and it seems like there\u2019s never anyone my age. I\u2019ve tried joining local clubs (Yoga, Toastmasters, and Tennis) but all 3 had an average age of like 50 and I felt awkward and like an outsider. I tried doing a couple meetups for board games, chess, and pickup softball but I was, again, the youngest guy by about 10 years.\n\nI know my area has a lot of young people, the average age is like 35 according to the census, but for some reason everywhere I go im the only \u201cyoung\u201d guy. Which is odd because I\u2019m not even that young.\n\nIs there some new app or something people are using to form groups and do stuff? Or is everyone just at home on Reddit like me?",

    "postText": "Ok. So say you're on a date and your nervous and anxious about it and all you can do is think about \"do they like me? Am I saying all the right things? Am I funny enough\"\n\nTrust me, been there done that and it was exhausting. I was so focused on if he likes me and doing all the right things, I never asked this simple question:\n\nDo I like this person?\n\nTaking a pause and asking yourself do you like the person before you right now as they are? \n\nNot only does it take a shit ton of pressure off you, you can actually focus on the date and have a good time (if it's going well) or part ways (if it doesn't).\n\nSo the next time you have a date (or meet someone new) instead of focusing on if they like you, take the power back and flip it on them. Do YOU like them.\n\nHopefully this can help. It helps me keep things in perspective.",

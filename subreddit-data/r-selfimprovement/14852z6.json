    "postText": "What are some ways to communicate that someone is being rude or inappropriate, without being aggressive? it's a big part of my self-improvement to be able to protect my self and other people without having to be cruel, provoking a scene, escalating conflict, or demonizing anyone. I also can't allow myself to continue being totally silent and getting walked over.\n\n\nFor example, I was thinking that if somebody makes a rude personal comment about your appearance, you can say something like \"Is that just how you go about in the world speaking to people?\" Okay, maybe that's not a great example, because I'm actually really bad at coming up with assertive ways to get people to reflect on their behavior!\n\n\nAlso, if you could recommend any resources on this subject matter I would greatly appreciate it.",

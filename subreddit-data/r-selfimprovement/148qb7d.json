    "postText": "Hi there, I'm new around here. English is not my first language, so sorry for the mistakes.\n\nThe thing is that I often mistreat my fellows, even if it's by accident. I know (or I think, at least) that my problem is pride. I spent a lot of time improving myself in almost all aspects, but in exchange I became prideful. I mean, everything I do is to help the ones around me, for the common good, even if (for reasons) sometimes things don't go out as planned. \n\nBut I find myself laughing or joking about the things they cannot do, or at those in which I'm better, or even by the time I talk about something I myself don't shine on. Not because I enjoy it, but it simply gets out of my mouth. Naturally, I often make mistakes, which I acknowledge as soon as I realize and try to correct, and those tend to affect other people. The problem is when the affected person don't believe the apology. And how could they, if I'm always mistreating them, or trying to \"opaque\" them because I think I can do better, or simply to take a weight off their shoulders, if I believe it'll help them?\n\nI don't know if I expressed it right, but I'm writing, worried, because it happened again a few hours ago with someone I worked with. I know, though, that this issue is one of the fundamental thing I must correct in order to achieve true improvement, or probably nothing will ever be truly fruitful.\n\nThanks beforehand...",

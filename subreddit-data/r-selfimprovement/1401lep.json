Went to a after prom party and the girl I liked went and kissed another guy with me on the couch right next to her even though she flirted with me at the party?!? Now I\u2019m at home going through my feeling being extremely jealous and don\u2019t know how to feel anymore.",

People of any ounce of integrity don't do that.\n\nYou should feel bad. But only because you deceived yourself. Her being like that has nothing to do with your worth.",

You\u2019re in high school, this isn\u2019t life or death and you\u2019d do yourself a large favor remembering that. Try and let the emotion go, don\u2019t hold any animosity toward her, and just be the best man YOU can be. She isn\u2019t evil, she doesn\u2019t owe you anything, but you expected better from her, all can be true. This will be a silly memory in the near future.",

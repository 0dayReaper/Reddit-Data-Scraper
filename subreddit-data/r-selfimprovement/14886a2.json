    "postText": "Sincerely that's what it feels like. It was slow and dragging at first, but suddenly I've burned-out and started flying into the races.\n\nMy depression has been becoming less and less, cause I've been just training myself mentally and emotionally, slowly trying to get into working out.\n\nI have a friend who's down to sell a car to me. I just gotta start saving for it. Which luckily, can be very soon depending on if I get this meeting done perfectly in two days now.\n\nFinally getting my own place once again after working so hard, which I've kept now for over a year.\n\nAlcohol has become something I respect in terms of what it actually is. A full understanding and not something to be taken lightly.\n\nSmoking is still bad though I'll admit. Life has been improving, been hard to get physical health into it all.\n\nI'm not giving up nor slowing down. \n\nI'm going to grasp my goals and become the man *I* want to be.\n\nIcing on the cake? Once I get more shit sorted and in order? I'm plucking up my beautiful sexy babe I've had my heart set on for over a decade.",

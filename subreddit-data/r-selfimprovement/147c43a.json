    "postText": "Recently I have realised that I\u2019m not a good person and it all came to a head 2 nights ago. \nI was out drinking with my sister and I was the most drunk I\u2019ve ever been in my life and I said her bf is really ugly (for no reason) and apparently I went overboard. Obviously she was hurt by it. I also started cussing a guy out because he rejected me and I said some stuff about his partner too(I\u2019m not sure exactly what I said, I just remember him showing me a picture of his partner) \nI have been thinking about it constantly and I am really embarrassed and feel extremely guilty about it (well deserved, I know). I don\u2019t want to be this kind of person, especially towards the people I love, so I\u2019m just wondering if any of you guys have some tips on how I can effectively mature and improve myself. I\u2019m 23 so I should know better by now, but I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019ve ended up like this. During my teen years up until age 18 I couldn\u2019t go outside and socialise due to extreme anxiety, so I\u2019m thinking maybe because I missed all these years of development I\u2019m going through it all now so I\u2019m basically learning social queues as an adult? I don\u2019t know, but maybe this information will help with advice. \nI would really appreciate the help. Thank you all for reading this :)",

Write all of the hurtful words that you say into that.\n\nAnd finally realize that you realizing that you messed up and that you feel bad because of it is the first step to change. You'll make it, I believe in you!",

It makes me believe that u just had an alcohol induced psykosis. U probably \"just\" need therapy",

So if you cut out the booze, you may not have quite as much of a social life, but you will be more in control of what you do and say. I grew up in an environment that included a lot of verbal abuse. Many people thought it was cool. It's taken a very long time for me to understand how hurtful all of that was, and I'm trying not only to avoid doing it now, but to make amends to people I hurt in the past.",

Second, therapy but third you it seems you may have a lot of self work for the insecurities (and anger) you\u2019re projecting on others. Try exploring shadow work! Journaling &amp; taking note on what triggers you will help you better understand yourself. I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re a bad person! Good luck!",

You sound anxious to get a partner but can't take rejection and lash out.\n\nThat's probably why you insulted your sister's boyfriend. You are jealous she has a boyfriend and you have to dunk on it to feel better about the fact that you are single.\n\nI mean no disrespect, just my immediate thoughts reading your post.",

Simple.\nIf you can drop volume will keeping up the frequency then great. If you can\u2019t keep yourself to just a few drinks then don\u2019t drink at all. \n\nI am tired of the statement \u2018he/she is just like this when they are drunk\u2019. I am not saying that you stated that but it is an important thing to think about.\n\nAll of my regrets happened when I drank too much. All of them. I have cut down to special occasions and I have an automatic trigger in my brain now to go home before I get past tipsy. I consider myself to be well spoken and witty, I notice fast now when my responses start to be instinct as opposed to just quick thinking. \n\nI keep a hard eye on it though. I sadly expect that the definition of \u2018tipsy\u2019 will start to change for me. If and when that happens then I will drop it. \n\nGood luck.",

            "comment": "Meditate on compassion. Or if you don't like the word meditate, just simply sit and think on compassion. Actively and consciously force yourself to feel that emotion of compassion and direct that towards those thoughts to the people around you. Think about how much you love your siblings, what you appreciate about them - and even with their partners, of course you don't love them, but you can think of the good things about them such as if they have a nice personality or a good sense of humour and actively appreciate that. \n\nOn a social skill level to help you build this compassion more, learn to be a more neutral listener. Get to know people more by asking them more open ended questions about their life and try be non-judgemental. For example when your sister shows you a pic of her boyfriend you may subsciously have a thought in your head that makes you want to say \"ew he's ugly or he looks weird\" or something. (I know you were in a drunk state of mind, I'm just using that as an example). Actively be aware of that thought, recognise that it's just a feeling/thought and you don't have to go along with it, put that thought/feeling to one side and choose a different way of looking at what your sister just said. This will help you to get to know people better and without interruption people can truly let you know how they feel or what they want to say and you may even learn something.",

It lowers inhibitions, that\u2019s what people like about it.\n\nWhether you were being mean or not depends on your intent. Maybe you were just trying to joke with her, or maybe you had other motives? I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019d just learn who you can let loose and be honest around. My family and certain friends don\u2019t take jokes of that nature seriously at all, it\u2019s just banter to them. Though others have more insecurities, they take it the wrong way, sometimes it even becomes a political issue somehow.\n\nAs long as you keep working at it you aren\u2019t a bad person. You are just ignorant like the rest of us. Keep learning, you are probably doing better than you think especially considering you\u2019re asking for help on this. I caution you against overthinking these things if you are someone who often blames themselves for things. If you put too much pressure on yourself, you\u2019re more likely to mess up.",

The next best thing has been meditation.\n\nI've been meditating now regularly for 15 years and it has completely changed my life. Even though my life is not perfect, I'm completely happy and accepting of it.\n\nI have virtually no stress, as I live in the current moment most of the time, except when I need to plan or when I need to reflect.\n\nMost importantly, it's taught me that kindness is just the right way to live.

    "postText": "So today I tried to not daydream at all. I tried to imagine what my life would be if I did not imagine myself in fake scenarios. And it's sad. My life is sad without daydreaming. I believe I daydream about those things that I want and can never have. Sometimes the desire to have those things increase so much that I have this strong urge to daydream right now. And then I waste my time doing that. This is affecting my life now. I'm in a really important phase of my career and I do not want to mess it up. But I can't stop. I think to stop, I need to accept that I will never have what I want. \n\n\n\n\nMy life is really boring. I have really less friends and tons of study to do. I know my life won't be same forever. In about 1 year I would be in college and maybe my life will improve then. But right now it sucks and daydreaming is the way I escape my sad life. Sadly that affects my studies, daily routine, focus, everything. This is the time I should develop skills, make a good portfolio for college, set aims etc but here I am, imagining myself in the situations I will never be. Please help me here.",

            "comment": "&gt; CBT from therapy identifies, challenges, and replaces the beliefs and assumptions you manifest with, ideally healthy accuracies.\n\n&gt; You're likely living with lies. Go get help from experts and you can absolutely be your own advocate for unlearning your harmful fantasies.\n\nYou know what you need to do according to what you want.\n\nMaybe you are incapable or uneducated to achieve what you want. That is part of the process of achieving a goal.\n\nContinue the process of achieving, re-evaluate the bar you set, or something else. I think you're in a bargaining stage right now.\n\nSome people almost never stop bargaining all the time.",

                            "comment": "I don't think relying on yourself even through books to help yourself is comprehensive enough strategy.\n\n&gt; For instance, someone may have the assumption that \"I must be perfect at everything I do or I am a failure.\" This type of thinking can lead to intense pressure, anxiety, and feelings of inadequacy. In CBT, a therapist would work with the individual to challenge and modify this assumption, perhaps helping them to see that it is not only unrealistic, but also unhelpful.\n\nOverall I'm concerned with self-help books, not only our application of them as consumers but also what if anything the authors are peddling.\n\nIdeally, it would be not buying or selling fantasy.\n\nThat said, you can absolutely choose to utilize your imagination to leverage pleasure, happiness, and comfort. I choose to sometimes.\n\nThere's a book I heard of called *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness by Olivia Telford*\n\nBut I don't know if it's legit. \n\nAs for me:\n\n&gt; I started reading *Buddhist psychology and cognitive-behavioral therapy: A clinician's guide.*  \n&gt; I'm still reading it so I have absolutely have no idea yet if they're drawing appropriate conclusions.   \n&gt; Everyone can look all sciencey but if they work backwards to support religious doctrine it's not honest.",

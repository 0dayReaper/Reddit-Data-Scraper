    "postText": "It\u2019s summer break for me, and I really can\u2019t figure out how to feel like i\u2019m doing something productive or something that makes me happy. I sit in my room all day, occasionally play video games (which barely counts as a hobby) and do nothing, which often makes me feel more inclined to masturbate. I\u2019ve failed several times and I often fail after 3 days. It was so much easier during school because it occupied me and gave me something to do. I really don\u2019t know what to do as I don\u2019t have any hobbies and there\u2019s none that i\u2019m really interested in that I haven\u2019t already tried. I\u2019d like to start cooking but that won\u2019t occupy my time and it is also quite expensive, I\u2019ve lost all motivation to play my guitar, video games don\u2019t really satisfy me, and I\u2019m scared to go to the gym because I\u2019m relatively small. I know that the gym is a pretty safe space but it still scares me and I don\u2019t wanna have to ask for a spot from a random person. I also have to work which gives me less time to do anything. What do I do? I feel like i\u2019m falling behind and not doing anything good with my time that actually brings me enjoyment or betters me.",

            "comment": "It sounds like you're thinking of good ideas on how to be productive and meaningful. What seems to be holding you back is your own thought process. Often times when we get stuck in situations like this, it's because the safety and satisfaction-seeking portion of our brains can convince us that what we are trying to achieve in the long term is not worth the effort. It will convince us that it's much easier to seek short-term satisfaction, like eating food, playing video games, masturbating, things of those nature -- things we can do almost immediately and derive pleasure from almost as quickly.\n\nThe best strategy I can find for overcoming these situations is to avoid giving power to those short-term satsifaction seeking thoughts. Here's how. As soon as you have an idea that you believe will bring you genuine long term happiness or productivity (and it certainly seems you have had some of these ideas already), there is a very short timeframe in which you need to take action before the safety/satisfaction-seeking thoughts can you convince you otherwise.\n\nIf you think to yourself, \"oh I should get up and go to gym\", immediately stand up and head towards the door. Take immediate action and respond without any hesitation to those healthier more productive thoughts. Otherwise those selfish satisfaction-seeking thoughts will overpower you and convince you not to do it. \n\n\"I'm small.\" \"I'm embarrassed to ask for a spot.\"\n\nThose are the satsifaction seeking thoughts. They want you to feel safe and comfortable and secure and unfortunately, they will hold you hostage and keep you unproductive.\n\nAnd now it might sound silly, but it works. Don't give it a second thought. Literally. Just immediately react to the healthy productive thought. Make it a rule for yourself or a mantra. If you think it, you have to do it. Make it a muscle memory response. I often times use the Nike slogan \"Just do it.\"\n\n\"You thought it, you got it.\" Another example of a mantra I sometimes use.\n\nIf you think it, and you acknowledge it's a good healthy thought, \"just do it.\" Imagine a timer in your head that starts ticking down as soon as you have a good wholesome thought. It's a very short timer before the \"bad\" thoughts will get you and stop you. Don't let them win.",

            "comment": "Hey, I totally get it. Summer break can sometimes leave us feeling unproductive and unsure of what to do. One suggestion is to consider exploring different hobbies or activities that you haven't tried before. It doesn't have to be expensive or time-consuming. Look for free or low-cost options like painting, photography, writing, or learning a new instrument online. Find something that genuinely interests you and gives you a sense of fulfillment. \n\nAdditionally, you could try the Forfeit app. It's an app where you set goals or tasks for yourself and attach a small monetary penalty if you don't complete them. It adds a bit of accountability and motivation to stay on track.\r Remember, it's okay to take small steps and try new things. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to be perfect or immediately find your passion. The important thing is to keep exploring, stay motivated, and find activities that bring you joy and fulfillment.",

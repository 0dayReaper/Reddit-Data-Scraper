    "postText": "Hello r/selfimprovenent,\n\nI'm reaching out to you today because I find myself at a loss on how to improve my quality of life. I'm an (18M) who has been fascinated by the idea of transforming into a new and improved version of myself over the past couple of years. However, despite my interest and efforts, I feel like I haven't made any progress.\n\nLet me provide a brief background on my journey. Since childhood, I've always been fairly skinny, which made me an easy target for teasing and mockery from other kids. I wasn't particularly good at sports, and in the early years of high school, I struggled academically due to my lack of effort. Despite being told that I had potential, I didn't apply myself and was only interested in video games. I rarely studied for tests, frequently handed in assignments late or didn't complete them at all. Somehow, I managed to scrape through that phase and graduate.\n\nSocially, I faced challenges too. While I had friends, many kids at school didn't like me, and even my \"friends\" treated me poorly. I developed thick skin, but those interactions left an impact on my subconscious. I spent the majority of my time at home, while others enjoyed hanging out with friends and attending house parties. Additionally, my relationship with my parents wasn't the best. Living under the same roof, we hardly talked outside of essential matters or when we had no choice but to be in the same space.\n\nDuring those years, discipline was lacking in my life. I relied on my parents for structure, masking the extent of my problem. It's worth mentioning that I never had a romantic relationship throughout my entire 16 years in my home country. Although I had female friends, opportunities for potential romantic connections either didn't align with my preferences or I somehow managed to mess things up. Romantic love remains something I long to experience, but it feels like an elusive concept that only exists for others.\n\nA year and a half ago, I moved to Canada, and that's when I truly realized how challenging life could be. Since my arrival, my mental health has been below average, with occasional good moments but also frequent bouts of despair. The hardships I face primarily revolve around my social life and lack of discipline. I entered a new high school, away from my parents' support, and discovered the difficulties of navigating life without constant guidance. Initially, I struggled with social anxiety, and many considered me to be mute and intimidating for the first few months. Gradually, I began to open up and interact with some people, but I soon realized that the students weren't as friendly as I had hoped.\n\nTo this day, I have made a few decent friends at school, but the connections lack the depth I desire. I rarely socialize outside of school or engage in activities beyond the bare minimum. My daily routine consists of attending school, spending time on social media, and struggling to get enough sleep. This pattern also extends to my interactions with girls. I haven't formed any meaningful connections with girls at school or in general. At most, I engage in text conversations for a few weeks before things fizzle out. While I have been involved with a girl or two during my time here, those experiences were short-lived.\n\nHowever, my primary obstacle lies in my lack of discipline. I've consumed a vast amount of self-improvement content, ranging from books and Reddit posts to podcasts, web articles, YouTube videos, and even TikToks. Regrettably, I haven't seen significant improvement in my life. The issue I've observed is that I am a slave to my emotions. Whatever I'm feeling in the present moment tends to dictate my actions. Additionally, I feel an insurmountable resistance towards anything that could potentially help me grow. Working out, studying, completing assignments, maintaining a healthy diet, consistent sleep patterns, posting YouTube videos, and improving my social life all seem like daunting challenges. Over time, they've started to feel impossible to conquer.\n\nI've always wanted to earn my own money, but my attempts to secure a job were unsuccessful. The lack of opportunities, combined with upcoming plans that will take me out of the country, make it difficult to pursue employment at the moment.\n\nThis internal struggle has led to what I believe is a sense of depression. Low emotional states and days filled with emptiness have become the norm. It's evident that I need help, which is why I've detailed my situation at length in the hope that someone can provide guidance. I genuinely want to become a better version of myself, but recent experiences have made it feel like an unattainable goal. Moreover, I yearn to find joy and fulfillment in life. Occasionally, I experience brief moments of happiness that make me wonder if this is how life is truly meant to be lived. I don't want to continue living an unenjoyable existence; I want to genuinely enjoy life.\n\nIn the title, I mentioned that I'm unsure if anyone is willing to offer advice or mentorship, as it seems I can't help myself. Nevertheless, I would be extremely grateful for any assistance provided.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my story, and I hope to receive some guidance that can set me on a path towards positive change.\n\nps: i used chat gpt to make this more readable, but the message is mine",

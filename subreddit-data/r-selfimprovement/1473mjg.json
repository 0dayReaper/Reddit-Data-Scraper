    "postText": "I'm 23 and i feel like my life is over as in I doomed myself with mediocrity. I'm below average in my studies, I'm skinny and ugly. I litterally have 0 talent at anything, can't sing can't dance can't play instruments, terrible at sports. I have 0 social skills can barely keep a conversation going with anyone. Ive tried this whole self improvement but it just don't work, I've tried going to the gym and it's been 3 years but i keep getting sharp pains and joint pains and there is no change in my body (Still skinny ). Ive tried therapy but it's just not for me. I'm mentally and physically weak and my state keeps deteriorating. Idk what to do im spiralling out of control. I feel like I'm alone and the whole world looks down on me. I want to give up so badly but at the same time i don't want. I don't know what to do. I got no one to turn to but to strangers on the internet so I'm begging anyone out here. Tell me something, anything to help me get better.",

Your way to your goals will not be the same as someone else's, or as easy, or as simple, but you can achieve every single one. \n\nStocks and investments work based on small increases over a long period of time. You put in the effort - 1% better every year, 1% better every month, every day - eventually you will become better than you'd ever dreamed possible. \n\nThere are no limits. Believe it's possible and commit fully to your plans. Things will work out. You deserve every good thing and none of them are forever out of reach. Never give up on these dreams.",

            "comment": "Sweetheart, please don't ever think that your not enough, or that your not good at anything! Everyone has things that they are good at your just looking to hard. I'm no ecspert at anything. I'm just giving my thoughts here, hope it helps in some way good.\nI'm not talented at things ,I'm just hard headed,lol.\nDon't look for things to be good at to fit in with anyone. Try to find things that make you happy or you enjoy doing. If someone decides that they want to join you in what your doing then great but if not that's ok too. And school work really isn't easy for anyone. I used to help out a couple of people with there's,not so much because I was good at it but because I had an outward perspective so it wasn't stressful for me because it wasn't directly to do with me personally. I just showed them how to not look at the entire paper or project as a hole it was breaking it down into smaller things that could be accomplished easily.\nAnd as fare as going to the Gym, my brother and I both have had issues with gaining weight. Stress can be a cause of not gaining weight. Not a lot of people have that issue but some do. And if you are having issues with joint pain consult a Dr, or try CBD balm. I thought it was bs till I tried it.\nAnd being beautiful isn't about how you look on the outside. I have met people in my life that if you actually talked to them they may appear beautiful at first glance, but to talk to them have been some of the most ugly creatures on the planet. And there are people who may come across at first glance as being intimidating, but one you talk to them they are some of the kindest most big hearted people you will ever meet.\nHope this may help some. Never think of giving up. Anyone can give up, it's the easy way out. But the easy way is more often than not, not the best way. Anything worth having is never easy. It's down right hard and can be discouraging at times. But when you've completed it it feels amazing.\nTake a few minutes and just write down what all you have done, with or without help, you'll realize that you've accomplished more than you've thought. \nPlease keep your head up, and please don't give up!\nBest wishes",

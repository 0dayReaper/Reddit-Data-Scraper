Life is stressful as it is already, it's incredibly toxic to go for the extreme lengths of obssessing over self improvement. A balance between the two is essential.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the award kind stranger and I guess this resonated to some people. Just remember life isn't a race and we just have to do our best :).",

I personally believe that if you don\u2019t go to the gym and eat junk (like you\u2019ve stated) most people will be very unhappy with such a habit in the long term, including being unfit (No, you can be fit without being ripped). Not to mention the effect it has on your physical and mental health to eat garbage and not exercise (something which aids in preventing issues like heart disease, dementia, diabetes etc) \n\nSure you can say \u201cwell at least I have a degree and make money\u201d but personally I think loving yourself is being disciplined enough to both make money and take care of your body and mind, because in the end you will look back and be proud that you did those hard things.",

If you seek to gain, it\u2019s because you think you have nothing(in terms of happiness.) but if you\u2019re happy and you do these things there is no self sabotage. I really think every human can be incredible, and the very idea of shame is what holds us down. The feeling of wrongness in something that feels right, I think this what causes people to be unhappy no matter how many shows they watch. Take everything away and you can still be happy, that\u2019s just a realization that most people forget. There\u2019s really nothing wrong with doing anything comfortable, but there is a needy mentality in needing things in order to achieve that state of mind, to seek what you don\u2019t think you can give yourself is self sabotage.

Self love is being able to truly forgive yourself and love yourself for who you are, the things you\u2019ve accomplished and the goals you set for yourself. Herein lies the key to self love, forgiveness of oneself. Too many people now carry the burden of guilt and self petty. If you can\u2019t forgive and love yourself who will? Gratitude is a symptom usually of someone who loves them self as they are able to appreciate the kindness of others.",

Its adding spinach to smoothies to get extra greens and nutrition into me in a fun way. Self love is getting lots of lavender scented things. \nSelf love can be parenting yourself, either through discipline like above but also in taking care of your inner child with cartoons and coloring. \n\nYou also arent sorry. You're parroting tough love mindsets. If it works for you, feel free to continue. But methods that work for you dont work for everyone and this one size fits all mentality is unhelpful. Tough love can lead to depression, guilt, and self hatred. \n\nI've been trying to get my shit together since I was 17 and am starting to accept that I cant meet the expectations I was taught by my parents and that it's ok. \n\nYou also are assuming others have the same goals as you. Not that theres anything wrong with exercise, diet, and mindfulness (whatever the fuck that is, I've tried and it's just noticing what you're feeling and it does nothing for how much I'm able to control what I'm feeling).\n\nMy goals are more along the lines of feeling functional and able to Make peace with my past, and eventually have a nice garden. \n\nI have some pricey lavender scented bath and lotion items. I even have a lavender plant. I consume a lot of media- its really relaxing to enjoy a 40 minute video essay, learn about something I never experienced, while playing minecraft and letting my mind fully empty. Suddenly I k ow a lot more about how the fresh prince of bel air production started and my minecraft build has a new wing with pretty colors. And I likely indulged in a small edible to help with work stress and guilt. \n\n\nAdditionally It's not gonna be overnight. Going from 0 to 100 is an unrealistic expectation",

You learn from them and will continue to learn from whatever mistakes you make. You won't let anyone's judgement hinder you. You define your meaning and successes.",

There are many individuals out there who prioritize diet and exercise out of spite for who they are, not for love of bettering themselves.   \n\n\nSelf-love can mean a lot of things to different people, and it can change over time. For someone who exercises all the time, self-love can actually mean putting down the barbells in favour of more time with family and friends - and vice versa. It's about being true to and understanding yourself, and accepting that the person you see is who you are in this moment, and that you have the choice to be something better.   \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm with ya that exercise, mindfulness, diet, and self-improvement are essential elements that play a role in self-love. As to what self love is - to me, it's really the ability to see yourself truthfully, to appreciate what you are regardless of flaws or setbacks, and to have the courage to use that knowledge to take the steps you need to be the best you possible.",

How can you care for and nourish that part of yourself so that you can heal and redirect that energy? \n\nAnd you may decide you aren\u2019t up for that exploration - and you can love yourself in that too. Loving yourself unconditionally is just that - loving yourself whether you are binging a series or running a marathon.",

Who are you? What does that mean? Why does any of that matter? A fool or a student may dig for an answer or make a joke, a roshi may lovingly admonish or say nothing, a wise man will give the answer no thought.\n\nThings will always change, things have been changing for billions of years, far longer than we have existed, things will continue changing long after we have a chance to observe let alone comprehend or impact it. Through non-doing nothing becomes undone, through non-being you never lose your potential. You can define yourself, refine yourself, or recline, but there is no rewind, a move undone is just a step retraced.\n\nTo love yourself is to know your potential\n\nEverything has flow, to struggle is to drown, an anxious stream may sweep you, but a gentle river will exhaust you, and a still ocean will consume you, but with a light heart, you may float.\n\nSorry for the pamphlet but as a person who made a living off physical labor and agility-based skills, philosophy really helped me come to terms with physical disabilities and forcing myself to let myself heal and do nothing, and not push myself to keep hurting myself in the name of getting stronger or getting ahead. Nothing has infinite potential, nothing can become anything, nothing is important, nothing is everything, everything has happened, nothing will happen, sooner or later we will all become nothing, embracing it while everything is around me, really makes being nothing pretty good.",

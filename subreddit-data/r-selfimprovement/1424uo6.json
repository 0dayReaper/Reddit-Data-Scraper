    "postText": "I'll try to be short here:\n\nI've always struggled mentally and so forth and as a result I think I display some low confident behaviors or just things that can make me a potential target for bad people. This has been a pattern and while yes I think some of these people are just bad people, I also feel I have a role in it as well. I'm in therapy and other programs trying to improve mental health, but I had a really rough childhood I feel pretty stunted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I feel like I'm not respected, want to work on things like body language and other things to portray more confidence. My confidence thus far has slowly gone up, but I am still trying to iron out my like unconfident behaviors",

            "comment": "One theory that\u2019s interesting is that a lack of confidence is a learned behavior, which is the opposite of what most people think, that we need to learn to be confident. \n\nYou already have the judgment that acting the way you do makes you a target but what if you already see being confident as a bigger threat? It might be the case that your perception that \u201cbeing more confident\u201d will only make more bad things happen. \n\nConfidence has nothing to do with how people treat you because how people treat you is a reflection of how they learned to treat others. Mind the metaphor but, it doesn\u2019t matter how good a peach you are, some people just don\u2019t like peaches. \n\nMore likely than not when someone treats you \u201cbad\u201d it only bothers because it reinforces something you already believe about yourself to be true. Insults don\u2019t work unless there is already some underlying insecurity or agreement. If some says they hate your orange hair and you don\u2019t have orange hair you\u2019d shrug confused. \n\nI guess to end it, nobody is a \u201cbad\u201d person. People can have traits that are bad for us to have, definitely, but that\u2019s because they don\u2019t know any better. Just because someone doesn\u2019t know something that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t hold them accountable and teach them (if we can), it only means that it doesn\u2019t register to them. You wouldn\u2019t be mad if a blind person bumped into you, well this person who treats you mean is blind, not with their eyes, but with a more valuable sense, their moral compass.",

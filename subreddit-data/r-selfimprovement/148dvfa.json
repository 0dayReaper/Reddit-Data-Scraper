    "postText": "I was curious if anyone could share their experience with giving up alcohol or fasting from alcohol for a period of time. What were the benefits? How long before you noticed positive results?\n\nI am not a heavy drinker, but I do drink with friends on the weekends. I will also have a drink or two if I\u2019m eating out for dinner at a restaurant. It seems this is a habit I would be better off without, but I\u2019ve found it difficult quitting due to the social aspect of drinking.",

Now I\u2019m allowing myself sips of my husband\u2019s drink or a super tiny glass of wine just because I like the taste. \nTo answer your question, my mind is clearer and I\u2019m less inclined to rash decisions.",

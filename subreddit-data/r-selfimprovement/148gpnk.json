    "postText": "Want to start exercising? Tell your friends you\u2019re an athlete who loves fitness.\n\nWant to be more optimistic? Tell your family you\u2019re a happy person.\n\nWant to stop procrastinating? Tell your coworkers you are someone they can always count on.\n\nIn each of these cases, the more people you tell and the more adamant you are, the more you\u2019ll feel psychological discomfort if you\u2019re not consistent with what you say.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel internal pressure to live up to what you said. Your friends will expect you to exercise, your family will expect you to be optimistic, and your coworkers will expect consistency.\n\nYou\u2019ll have tricked yourself into feeling motivated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 8 months of procrastination I\u2019m publishing 25 lessons from 25 years. These are the most important things I\u2019ve learned. I\u2019ll publish one or more per day until I\u2019m through. Cheers!\n\n1 of 25",

Same for boxing, tho I\u2019m not truly delusional I come from a background of likely having all the right genetic traits, af least a as I see it. I was talented in the 100m and I\u2019m  not particularly muscular, must be down to long tendons and lots of fast twitch fibers  combined with long levers, so it\u2019s like\u2026. I\u2019d  say tho that when your dreams are so\u2026. Grand as mine, you still have to accept that even if you pour your heart and so l into it, it takes a LONG time and you have to just consistently strive. When you have passion, it\u2019s very doable.",

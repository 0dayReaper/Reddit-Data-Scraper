So for anyone over the age of 30, what would you say to your 20 year old self? What do you regret? If you knew what you knew now and could go back in time, what would you make your younger self do?",

I've lost great relationships, good friends, alienated myself, and have held losses that have destroyed me mentally. Thing is I'm not over 30 but fuck it dude, no point in holding yourself back, you just gotta learn from your mistakes.",

If you want avoid \u201cmistakes\u201d, just don\u2019t try anything new, which I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you\u2019re aiming for.",

            "comment": "Joining a gym can really change your life! I used to be overwight and not into sports when I was young, but hitting the gym has made me feel amazing both physically and mentally. It's seriously one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nIf you're serious about getting stronger, you gotta put in the work. Don't worry about supplements or meds until you've been going to the gym regularly for at least three months. And trust me, there's no pill that'll magically give you muscles without effort. Even people using illegal steriods have to put in tons of effort to get and maintain a good physique. If there was a miracle pill, we'd all be ripped!\n\nWhen it comes to supplements, focus on Protein Powders, Creatine, and Pre-Workout. Protein Powder makes it easier to get enough protein for muscle growth. Shoot for around 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day. It's not a must-have, but it is a convenient source of protein to help hit your daily goals.\n\nPre-Workout is something you take before exercising to boost your workouts. Usually, it has energy-boosting stuff like caffeine, focus ingredients to help you concentrate, and things that pump up your muscles for a fuller look during your workouts.\n\nCreatine is another supplement, and it works well when combined with strength training. But remember, it's not a magic fix on its own. It just helps you get better results when you're working out properly.\n\nFinal thing, it's not just about exercising. Your body is like a car\u2014you can't expect it to run well if you don't fuel it properly. No matter how much you exercise, if you don't eat right, you won't see significant progress.\n\nStart by finding out your maintenance calories using an online calculator. This tells you how many calories you need to maintain your current weight. Then, aim to be in a 300-500 calorie surplus from that. This surplus provides your body with the extra energy it needs to build muscle.\n\n**TL;DR:  Joining a gym can transform your life. Prioritize consistent exercise over supplements. Calculate your maintenance calories and eat in a surplus for muscle growth. Fuel your body properly for optimal results.**",

Start with low weights, basic exercises like bicep curls, lunges, chest presses, squats, dead bugs. 3-4 days a week, 4 exercises with 3 sets per exercise. \n\nStart with super low weight and focus on getting the form right. I would suggest taking creatine after you work your way up on weights. I started doing leg presses at 80 pounds worked to 120 without Creatine over 4 months, 4 months after that I\u2019m doing 160 on Creatine. \nEat your weight in protein\u2757\ufe0f\nPre workout.. it\u2019s just caffeine dude. Just drink a small cup of coffee before or take half an energy drink. Pre workout is expensive af. So is eating enough protein. And get plenty of rest. Muscles need plenty of sleep to get stronger. Soon you\u2019ll be able to pick up a 50 pound bag of rice. \n\nI work at a bakery and ingredients come in 50 pound bags \ud83e\udd74 I was struggling before I hit the gym. Now that bag of sugar is like picking up a a gallon of water. You\u2019ll get there, but you HAVE to put in the work.",

    "postText": "I have been trying so hard to improve myself . I went through therapy for a while , I was finally making moves to leave my hometown and better myself.\n\n\nI got involved with someone that meant a lot to me at the time and it turned out they were just using me.\n\nI had been struggling with being used and abused before. I thought I did enough work to be able to see through it.\n\nI tried so hard. I've been trying so hard to do everything right. \n\nI don't have a will to live or love anyone anymore. I don't want connections . I don't want to care for anyone anymore. Just when I was crawling out of this out of darkness , I was dragged back in.\n\nI feel so hopeless and trapped in this stupid apparatus of life. I am in so much pain. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry that this isn't the right place. Sorry if I am upsetting anyone.\n\nI just want relief. I thought it was here. I worked so hard for it. And I'm still suffering and drowning. I tried therapy. I tried. I did it for yesrs. Medication too. I'm sorry that I'm not just taking that as the obvious answer. It just didn't work for me.\n\nI'm so tired. Every day I'm crying . Even when I'm working . It just leaks.\n\nI don't want to play this game anymore.",

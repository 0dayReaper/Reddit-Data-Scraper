    "postText": "For a little context I dropped out of school because of my mental illness. Now I have the option of going back but doing subjects that might not get me into a good uni or doing an online course at home. Neither which I think I have the discipline for. I can choose one\u2026but I\u2019m so scared of failing. I\u2019m a serial procrastinator and I have legit nightmares of my education. Yes I know going to uni is not the only way to success but for me who grew up in poverty it is. I\u2019m just so sad and disappointed in my self. People think I\u2019m lazy but I genuinely can\u2019t get out of my head it\u2019s eating me alive. I just want some advice and some words of encouragement tbh. Like how disciplined should I get in order to achieve this",

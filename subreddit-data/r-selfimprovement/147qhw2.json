    "postText": "ever since i started being active a few years ago, i\u2019ve been in pain and haven\u2019t been able to get fit.\n\ni developed tarsal tunnel syndrome after i started skateboarding and ive done a decent amount of PT, orthotics, and a numbing shot to my nerve, but the problem persists. on top of that i have neck, knee, and back pain, and i keep pulling muscles in my back, groin, and hamstrings when i stretch or exercise. i cant engage in my favorite activities (skateboarding, ice skating, biking, walking) more than 1 time a week without excessive pain. when i do my PT exercises at home, it feels like it\u2019s causing more pain and muscle pulls.  no matter what i do, i don\u2019t feel like my body ever gets stronger.\n\nam i doing something wrong? too much stretching not enough strengthening? doing it in the wrong order? i\u2019m only 26 and i feel like my body cannot handle exercise, but i\u2019m an athletic person and i want to get fit and be able to run. any advice?",

            "comment": "Hello! Before I start I want to say that I have been running daily for almost 2 months now and these were the problems I Faced at first while beeing active every day.\nFirst of all, I suggest you check your sleep scedual and meals. Are you getting enough rest and energy so to speak. Secoundly, what type of streching and how long? For example there will be no use of yoga if you have sharp knee pain for example, you need to strech the joints you use the most. Up next, rest days, if you continue whitout rest your body will tighten up on itself and choke you out, rest once in a while. Also it could be becouse of stress or overworking, maybe you are doing too much and your body just can't keep up.",

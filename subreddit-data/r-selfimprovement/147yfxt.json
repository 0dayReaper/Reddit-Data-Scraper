    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI hope this doesn't come as ungrateful but I really hope that I get accepted to study in France. I'm from a french country and I have dual citizenship (canadian and european) so studying abroad isn't an issue. \n\nI feel like I've done my life here. This might sound weird since I'm only in my early 20s but I feel like I finished my life here. My life has dramatically changed since 2020 (since covid basically) and I feel like studying abroad. I'm currently studying philosophy to become a high school teacher and just did my first year. I'm applying to continue my bachelors. I applied to 3 schools and I could get answers starting tomorrow. I have a strong academic, a letter of recommandation, tutoring experience, etc. Only issue is I'm missing one class worth of credit. Fortunately, I'm taking a summer class to get all the credits (I sent the proofs to my applications so they know about the summer class).\n\nAnyways, after losing most of my friends and ex due to OCD (currently in recovery and going great), I wanna to change my life. This place (where I live) is behind me. I know this might sound \"fantasy\" or \"anime\" but that's how I really feel like. \n\nI hope that I get accepted to one of the schools.",

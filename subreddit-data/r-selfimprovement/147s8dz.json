We were living together, and these 6 days were really like hell for me (i am quite anxious and warm person). It is still the most traumatic event in our relationship for me. \n\nSo it's really cool that you want to change this. Maybe at least some honest \"I don't want to speak now, but we are okay\" thing can work...",

If it's too hard to do inner child work while going cold, try to first calm down your nervous system. \n\nGoing cold on someone is a defense mechanism that doesn't work for you anymore. So try to understand what your subconscious tries to defend in those moments (schema therapy could help with that).\n\nThere's a lot of valuable information online about these topics. I've worked through it myself for the biggest part and can now recognize when it happens and deal with it in the moment. It's an absolute game changer in my relationships. So have hope that this is a skill you can definitely learn.",

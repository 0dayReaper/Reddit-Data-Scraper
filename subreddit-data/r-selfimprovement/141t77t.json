    "postText": "I'm not going to sugarcoat this or anything but I've just got broken up recently by my ex who I was dating for 9.5 months. To put things straight the reason behind the breakup was that she wasn't able to forgive me for self-sabotaging the relationship, being open about our sex life with other friends, etc.  I'd rather not dive into any specifics or anything but over the course of the relationship I wasn't the perfect partner and I am speaking this out of genuine honesty and truth, I am not a good person and I have failed this relationship.\n\nI was manipulative, self centered, selfish, egotistical, and a people pleaser.  I was pushy with putting my ex on birth control, I took her for granted on a few instances, some instances that I was not aware I was doing. After I got a very long text message from a former friend of mine basically calling out every single mistake/flaw that I have made in the relationship and having one of my last friends leave me for seeing how toxic I am. After all of this, I see that I am actually a very, VERY toxic person.\n\nI don't know if I am lying to myself when I say that but I say this because last year I used to be friends with my ex-friends abusive ex. The two of us were very close, in fact, I looked up to this guy and basically wanted to be like him because at the time I thought he was this super confident person who knew what he was doing in the world since he was also serving the military and by the time I realized his true colors I noticed how he took me for granted and brainwashed me by inheriting toxic habits such as people pleasing, manipulating, being selfish, etc.\n\nI know that the actions I've done to my friends and my ex were from me. There is no escaping that, every action, every decision, every mistake that I've made was my fault, and knowing all of this I cannot help but blame myself for my actions. The only people left in my life now are my 3 loyal friends. One from high school and the other two who I met last year.\n\nDespite everything that I have done to them and to others they are still there for me and it is something that I am very grateful for. \n\nI've already started to pinpoint the things on what went wrong in the relationship and really started to dive deep into what made me a toxic individual. I've already rescheduled my appointment with my therapist for later this week and yet I still feel lost except that the only thing I know I am great at doing is blaming myself and to this day I still am because when my ex-friend texted me she said that I failed my relationship, my ex, my friends and myself and that is something that I've been constantly repeating in my head ever since that day.\n\nI just feel like that even after being completely zeroed out on my social life that the universe is telling me something. It's telling me that I need to rediscover who I am even if it means being alone for a while and even if it means cutting myself off from the outside world and social media entirely. \n\nI would love to add more onto this but I feel like that I am just repeating myself over and over again, if there is anyone that can help me get out of this rut or at the very least guide me on the path that I need to take please do so. Thank you for reading.",

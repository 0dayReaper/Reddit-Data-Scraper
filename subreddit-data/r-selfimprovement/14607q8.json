    "postText": "The title is self explanatory. Please help. (I'll accept religious and non religious advice). I'm 15 and I get moments of \"overrealization\" where I realize we're animals on a floating ball in space we don't know what keeps us here. Added to that a feeling of meaninglessness and thoughts about the after life. Haven't had any traumatic event it just clicked in my mind randomly. Typical questions like \"What's the meaning of life?\" \"Why does anything exist?\" \"Why is there something rather than nothing?\"",

The more you dislike or resist it , the more it grows on you and makes life unbearable. I\u2019ve experienced it all. Now at the age of 34 , I know I\u2019ve to live with it. So make it useful. Many lessons will come on the path but rather than floating in the ocean of disparity or sadness, you\u2019ll know how to navigate through it. \nYou\u2019re lucky in a way , most of the people here are stuck in a rat race. Sometimes it seems like a boon but actually it\u2019s not. The awareness you\u2019ve got is a gift. You\u2019ll learn to use it wisely and with time and please try to be open about learning good things about it. \nPS : English could be bad but I hope you got the gist.",

    "postText": "But for some reason something deep inside me really wants to try and look for a companionship/relationship. Even my therapist is encouraging me and says that I could handle myself out in the dating scene.\n\nBut I haven't have the faintest idea how to act in a relationship (I'm not talking about sexual stuff here, those seem easy to learn). But I was just never the one in my friend groups who organizes or plans events. And I'm not a good storyteller either, even though I had a ton of experiences in my life.\n\nNot sure what I wanted to get out of this by posting this here, and I'm really getting ahead of myself by thinking about this as I won't be starting to date anytime soon so..",

I thought my relationship was perfect and my boyfriend suddenly started getting so jealous he was accusing me of having affairs with literally anyone I ever contacted including like the receptionist at the doctors office and got so aggressive about demanding I confess that I had to go no contact.\n\nNot to scare you off in any way, but connection means vulnerability and vulnerability means you could get hurt.  The important thing is to have faith in yourself to see yourself through that potential hurt and be ok in the end.  So I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t try to be your best in a relationship, but realize the person you find might be ok with your flaws.  Maybe it will work out great.\n\nOr maybe it won\u2019t and you will learn something you can do better next time.\n\nNo need to be perfect, just keep trying and you\u2019ll likely get where you want to be.",

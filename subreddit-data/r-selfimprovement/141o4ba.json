    "postText": "Hi all, I am a big practitioner of doing very uncomfortable things just within my grasp. I have noticed great improvements in my ability to take on difficult tasks as a result. There is however one issue that ive encountered: the benefit that I gain from taking on an uncomfortable task is lessened over time, and even if I increase the intensity of the difficult task, I still cannot reach the place that I once had. My hunch is that this is because though the task may still be difficult, it is a discomfort that I am used to. I know how to navigate this discomfort because it isn't a new feeling anymore. The following are some of the challenges that I have taken on:\n\n-cold exposure\n-high intensity gym/kettlebell workouts\n-long term cardiovascular training\n-prolonged focus when attending to studies\n-long form meditation\n-fasting (water fast, dopamine fast)\n-social related discomfort (I do stand up comedy, I have worked on my competence at flirting, making friends)\n\nWith each of these, even if I am to go deeper into the pain than I am used to, I still know how to navigate it. What are some of your methods to achieve discomfort? What are some new avenues and feats that I can work on to further improve my resilience? Open to all suggestions!\n\nThanks all!\n\nTL;DR\nI don't gain the same benefit from difficult tasks that I once did even if I increase the intensity. My hunch is that this is because I know how to navigate this discomfort in the avenues that I seek it. What are some new avenues and tasks that I can try to find string discomfort to work through?",

            "comment": "Hey! I understand the pain when it comes to physical discomfort, but how come long form meditation brings you discomfort? I was sure that it\u2019s supposed to either bring you peace or focus. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure if \u201cprolonged focus when attending studies\u201d does you any good. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s just that your brain doesn\u2019t recover the same way the rest of the body does - just be careful with overtraining it.\n\nWhen it comes to suggesting anything, as my area of expertise is software development, I can assure you that learning at least one of programming languages can get you out of the comfort zone (just don\u2019t do Python, because it would be cheating :D).\n\nAnd to answer your question how to achieve discomfort, I would say that taking responsibility for my every decision is a pretty good example.\n\nAs I\u2019m perfectionist it helps me to just finish things without feeling satisfied (it\u2019s mostly related to arts like painting or playing music).\n\nNice topic selection, thanks for the food for thought!",

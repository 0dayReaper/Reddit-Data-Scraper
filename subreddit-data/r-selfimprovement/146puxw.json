    "postText": "I (16M) realize that I have a (comparatively) mature mindset but that I act way less mature than I should be.\n\nWhen I don\u2019t get what I want, I usually shut down and just go cold or try my hardest to get their attention by nagging, shouting, guilt tripping or a mix of any.\n\nWhen I\u2019m stressed or feel threatened, I detach and remove myself completely and my brain keeps telling me its their fault.\n\nMy first instinct is to be heard and i\u2019m incredibly impulsive. I act not caring about the opinions of others but I realize that it makes me act like a 9 year old becoming independent for the first time. \n\nI don\u2019t know how many of these initial responses are actually because of immaturity or if it\u2019s a different issue (like self-centeredness) but whatever it is, I\u2019d like advice and I\u2019d like to change. \n\nAnything would be greatly appreciated.",

The ultimate goal is to be able to recognize them and respond appropriately in real-time as it happens, but a good starting point is to work through it after the fact in the evening.  \n\nBefore long you'll start to see things develop and recognize them as they are happening, and that will cue you to pay attention to how you respond using the ideas you developed previously.\n\nIt's a process so it will take some time and you won't always get it right, so be patient but stick with it, and before too long you'll begin to see improvements.",

I had to think about what I was doing to solve the problem and concluded that surrounding myself with maturity and distancing myself from immature things helped me the most.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI put people on a pedestal and thought I wasn't good enough for them. It might sound harsh, but what helped me was to distance myself from them and improve to the point where I can realistically see how good I can really get. It may seem like this has nothing to do with being childish, but it has boosted my self-esteem tremendously, which is perhaps the main reason I can no longer behave childishly.\r  \n\r  \nThis isn't necessarily for you, but I've seen a lot of Hamza's videos and I can't put into words how much he's helped me. He got me into fitness and helped me with so many different things.\r  \nI definitely recommend his YouTube channel.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI've been on the self improvement journey for almost a year now and have improved A LOT, but I'm still nowhere near where I want to be. Just compare yourself to who you were yesterday. It will take a while but it will be worth it.\r  \n\r  \nPS: Don't expect the people around you (like in your class) to see you differently. I've tried acting sad or angry in class but they don't seem to care or even notice. Just focus on yourself.\r  \nAnd often it is said: \"Don't lose your inner child!\". Being mature as an adult is far more important than making sure you don't lose your inner child. And I don't even think you can really lose your inner child.\r  \n\r  \nI hope this helps you...",

            "comment": "16 is a pretty traditional age to have self-absorbed behavior. Having a \"stiff upper lip\" about setbacks and small things that don't affect your health, the roof over your head, the nourishment you need to survive, and educational opportunities. \nSometimes, getting what you want is really disheartening. You talk all this big story about how great things will be when you get it, and then nothing changes or you don't like it. \nAs you get older you start to realize more clearly what's worth fussing over. But trying to be respectful to your parents and not show annoyance is a good discipline. You'll need that at work.",

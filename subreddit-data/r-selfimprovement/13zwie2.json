    "postText": "For some background, I'm a 23 year old male. I still live at home. I'm short as fuck, 5' even. Only weighed 122lbs today. Have little to no fitness level even when I work a semi-physically demanding job, tire and oil tech. My nutrition is shit. My social skills are almost nonexistent outside of customer based one. I avoid conflict. I have a very close relationship to a female I love with all of my heart, she loves someone else though. That friendship is strictly online. Yes, she is who she says she is. I'm not getting catfished.\n\nAs I type these words I have tears in my eyes, I cried for almost 30 minutes last night until my face went tingly. Her and I had a long and deep conversation last night and our friendship almost ended. We're on a break from each other right now. She said she needs time, I intend to give that to her.\n\nI don't know what the fuck to do. I want to change my life, I want to change my course and the path that I'm on. I just don't even know where to start.\n\nI need help. Anything. I need guidance, I need someone to tell me where the fuck to even start.\n\nI just need anything right now.",

            "comment": "my advice to you\n\nto start you really need to focus on yourself\n\nyou sound really caught up on this girl that doesn\u2019t feel the same way. i understand how deeply you feel about her but i\u2019ve been in that situation before and it drained me. it\u2019s extremely unhealthy. the whole \u201cjust friends\u201d thing didn\u2019t work because i knew i wanted more but you can\u2019t change the way someone else feels. while you\u2019re distanced from her now clear your head (meditation helps) and really ask yourself if you can be just friends. if you don\u2019t think you can continue that way and keep a healthy mindset and relationship with yourself then i don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth pursuing. love comes and goes but you can\u2019t sacrifice your peace of mind. when the time comes and you find someone that\u2019s worth it and loves you too then you can love them as much as you want. for now focus on the things you can control such as yourself.\n\nfor one don\u2019t view yourself (your height or any other traits) or your life with a negative attitude. you\u2019re not fucked as much as you think you are - once you realize that and get out of that mindset it frees you. it\u2019s a process but a necessary one. \n\ni can\u2019t give you exact steps because everyone has a unique path and life but i can say that wherever you choose to start it will be very difficult and discouraging but once you make progress and your effort compounds over time you\u2019ll see how far you\u2019ve made it and be extremely proud of yourself. but you HAVE to put in the effort and do NOT make excuses or blame yourself\n\nassess yourself and figure out what you think is holding you back from what you want out of your life and start with the little things first then slowly work your way up and out. i promise it\u2019ll get better and easier you still have so much time.\n\nas far as fitness and nutrition goes i can recommend the built with science program by Jeremy Ethier (totally optional but it pretty much spoon-feeds you everything you need and is worth the $ if you\u2019re serious about it). \n\ni hope those words helped you in some way and i hope you find your path. good luck to you",

We've been through way worse, and our bond is very unique to the two of us. Neither of us wants to walk away from the other. We're both going through some very emotional and mentally challenging times right now. Her feelings and emotions are just as fucked up as mine. We're both hurt. We both just need time.\n\nOn the nutrition and fitness side, I know that's where I need to start. With my body and how imbalanced it is I don't know where to begin or what to do. I need to do a lot of research first. I had a Plica in my left elbow for almost 4 years before I had surgery to remove it. My left arm still isn't even close to being 100% healed yet and it's been two years now.\n\nThank you again, time heals all wounds. The waiting game just sucks ass I suppose lol",

            "comment": "Well my main piece of advice would be to realize that you do have a lot of time left. You literally have decades left in your life. So if you're aiming to improve yourself , understand that it's going to take time. Time that you have. You're not going to change into a completely different person in a week and that's ok. Try to think long term. At the rate you're going, how different will you be in a few months? Or a year.\n\nCreate a list of habits you want to adopt. These could include working out, reading, sleeping on time, learning how to cook, going out to social events, etc. I don't know your life so I can't say exactly what habits you need to build but I'd recommend working out as one. It'll help improve your physical health, mental health, and overall confidence in life. It probably also helps with romantic relationships. \n\nBut do remember to take it one step at a time. Don't just try to establish a dozen different habits at once. One habit at a time. It's easy to look at all the different things we need to improve on in life and get overwhelmed and lose all motivation. \n\nIt would also be helpful to create some kind of progress bar and record your successes. For example, if you were trying to make a habit of working out 3 days a week than you can create a counter where you give yourself one point for every week you succeeded in that goal. And every week you failed could result in you losing a point. It's important to not feel like you've lost all your progress just because you fail once or twice. Create a specific number of points you want to reach before you feel like adding another habit you want to establish to the list. I find being able to quantify your progress and your goals makes them a lot clearer and easier to work towards.\n\nMy final point of advice would be to properly remember how much you hate your life right now. And properly visualize what type of life you want to lead. Writing these feelings down is definitely a good step. Sometimes when you're on your self improvement journey, you can forget just how much you hated the life you were leading before. It feels easy to give up and fall back into your old self. It's comfortable to return to the life you've already lived for so long. But you're fighting for your life here. Fighting for a life that's worth it. There's nothing more important than that.",

                    "comment": "Thank you. Seriously, you nailed everything. From habits to how I feel you said exactly what needed to be said. That's exactly what I wanted to hear. I'm at the lowest point in my life it feels. I've thought that before, but this is new to me. About an hour ago, I cried until my face went numb, my ears were ringing, and I felt like I was about to pass out. I think I need some professional help as well. I'm not suicidal in this slightest. I've seen what that does, and just the thought disgusts me. But there is definitely something deeper going on. I'm not an emotional person, fuck it took almost 10 years for me to cry again. I had to force the tears out last night because I knew I wanted to let it out but just felt blocked. \n\nI know where I need to start. That's fitness. I need to lay out a plan and path for me in life. Thank you for your input.",

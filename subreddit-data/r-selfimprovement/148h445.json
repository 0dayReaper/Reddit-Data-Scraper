    "postText": "Best decision I have ever made.\n\n9 months into our relationship, my girlfriend cheated on me with her guy friend that she told me not to worry about. I had very low self esteem at the time, and I didn't think I could do better. I also loved her more than anything. I stayed, like an idiot.\n\nThe years that followed were filled with her resisting all of my boundaries, arguing with me when I gave her advice on how to reach her goals, lying to me, and gaslighting me when she violated my boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, I worked on \"trusting her,\" and I worked my ass off to provide whatever else I could to the relationship. I was building a business as well, and I was working a good 16-18hrs every day. During this time, she never lifted a finger to help me.\n\nI was chronically depressed, I almost lost sight of all my goals and I was s\\*\\*c\\*dal.\n\nBecause I was so busy building my business (which she would directly benefit from), I asked her to help me out with whatever I didn't have time for (folding some laundry for me while I was out working, bringing some food with her when she visited, etc) . Which, of course, she protested. Sometimes, after alot of arguing, she would do it for a few days or weeks, then she would fall off again.\n\nIt wasn't fair that I was breaking my mind and body to build a life for us while she resented putting in any effort to contribute.\n\nFinally, I said \"Fuck this.\" I was being faithful and good to a woman who was only good to me when it served her self-interest.\n\nI started ignoring her attention-seeking, laid down boundaries for myself to help focus on my fitness and my business, and was finally starting to make decent money.\n\nOn the Saturday I ended things, I had started working at 6am and finished working at 10:15pm. Earlier that day, I had taken extra time and made sure my apartment was clean (yes, actually clean) and all my laundry was folded and put away, hence why I was working so late on a Saturday night. When she arrived, the first thing she complained about was the state of my washroom. You can imagine my frustration at this point, working 16-18 hours a day just for my girlfriend to come complain about my life rather than put in some effort to help me out. (By the way, anytime I have lived with roommates, I was always the cleanest person)\n\nLater, while I was wrapping up my work for the night, I asked her to warm up some pre-cooked food for me. \n\nShe replied, \"No, I'm not your maid.\"\n\nI immediately showed her the door and haven't spoken to her since.\n\nPS. I no longer struggle with depression, s\\*\\*c\\*dal thoughts or addictions. They all left on the heels of my ex. I cleared $9K in my business in May, and am set to do it again in June. Next week I am going on a date with a girl who is so beautfiul, I wouldv'e never dared approach her four years ago.\n\nThe right woman can catapult you towards your goals. The wrong woman can be a ball and chain.\n\nDon't underestimate the importance of difficult decisions. A good life is not far away.",

He should have dumped her for sure after that, regardless.\n\nBut, to expect her to clean up after him, heating his meals, washing and folding his clothes etc while living separate and not supporting her is expecting too much. Is she supposed to sacrifice her time and treat looking after OP as a job? OP chose his career path and could very well step away from it into something that is 40hrs a week or learn to look after himself while pursuing his goals.\n\nSounds like a toxic relationship from both sides and at the very  least OP needs to take some accountability and try not bring that attitude into future relationships. She likely felt she came second to his job and barely seen him and when she did instead of showing affection he told her to cook and clean? There's often 2 sides to a story and he could probably improve a lot by viewing things from her side.",

She is likely working too, and she's not your maid, and shes not being paid by you, so make your own food and do your own damn house work. Sucks that you decided to have a business that takes time away from domestic work but it's your life not hers.",

But also please be careful, what you sees as normal might not be.  This can cause skewed judgment when making choices in a relationship going forward.  Like arguing about taking your advice is not a red flag.  Offering unasked for advice is, and expecting that you know best how to manage someone else\u2019s issues is.  That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t have standards about your partners or even friends having a proactive attitude about their issues.  But the way you express it makes me cringe a bit.  Same with the bossing her around.  If you can convince someone that helping you out based on your workload and shared goals is fair, then great.  If you want to make agreeing to that type of thing a requirement for your commitment of time and energy in a relationship that\u2019s fine.  But if they aren\u2019t convinced, it\u2019s not a character flaw.  Maybe your vision wasn\u2019t compelling to her.  Maybe you don\u2019t share the same values.  That\u2019s something to discuss and resolve, not to push on someone and resent it when they don\u2019t submit.\n\nFinally, requiring fidelity is absolutely reasonable, but if your gf cheated, it\u2019s about her character, decision making, and values, it\u2019s not about whether she has a male friend.  You didn\u2019t say anything about how you would approach something like that now, but the fact that you brought up the friend like it was a boundary violation for her to even be in a situation to be unfaithful is another big red flag.\n\nSincerely good luck with your business, but based off this I would not recommend a girl to date you.",

If you are insecure about your partner\u2019s opposite sex friends and ask for your insecurity to be validated, what are they supposed to say\u2026 \nThey say don\u2019t worry because they want you to not worry. \n\nthe implication of the meme is, if you have to ask them if it\u2019s an inappropriate relationship, it\u2019s not a relationship they should be in if they are faithful.  But people are insecure pretty frequently for a lot of valid and invalid reasons and it\u2019s not inappropriate to have opposite sex friendships.  \n\nIf they are going to cheat it\u2019s because they don\u2019t care about their partner and are not trustworthy, not because there was someone else in the picture.  Either people need to trust their partners when they say not to worry or they need to not date until they can deal with their jealousy.  Or at the very least if they know they can\u2019t handle their worries they need to agree on boundaries about opposite sex friendships at the very beginning and not date people who have them.  \n\nIsolating people you are dating from their friends because of your insecurity is a red flag.  Acting like people you date should feel guilty if you become jealous is a big red flag.  These are the implications of the \u2018guy/girl they told you not to worry about\u2019 meme and they are toxic.\n\nSo while this guy trusted their partner (good), and got hurt (unfortunate), the reference to the meme makes it sound like they regret their trust and now hold a view similar to the meme.",

Your actions should have been put into place earlier but it's never  too late to give a boot to a cheating, selfish person. If that person does not compliment your lifestyle or assist you in achieving your goals then they're not worth it, compromises go both ways and in a relationship you give some and you expect the same in return and not to be used as a doormat. Keep working on yourself and focus on your goals, it sounds like you have the right idea, the grass is always greener on the other side and have to also be careful who you get involved with but always keep your options open with a positive outlook.",

You have never tried to be a bad one, nor to make your life worse, but we do precisely that because what we call \u201cgood\u201d is either neutral or even \u201cevil\u201d. \n\nI\u2019d offer picking up books that discuss that. I\u2019m a Stoic practitioner so I\u2019d offer this book called the \u201cDiscourses of Epictetus\u201d. Each chapter is isolated so you can skip stuff that\u2019s too hard. There are free versions of it online and even audiobooks of it.",

Whether it's being more patient, practicing gratitude, or being a better listener, take baby steps towards your goal.\r To add a fun twist, you can try using the Forfeit app. It's this cool app where you set tasks for yourself and if you don't complete them, you lose some money. Just make sure the tasks are realistic and manageable so you don't end up losing all your cash!\r  \n\rRemember, personal growth is a journey and it takes time. Be kind to yourself along the way and celebrate the progress you make, no matter how small.",

    "postText": "I have a friend thats in a dark place, a way different place then me. I am 4 years clean and far away from hometown. I have known her since we were 8 years old, I love her like a sister and seeing her where she is breaks my heart. I assume she is doing drugs and selling herself to get money. I lived that way a long time ago and chose life and left everyone I loved and knew behind to get clean and healthy. I am still not fully emotionally or mentally recovered, I dont think I ever will be but I recent;y reached out to her because I heard she relapsed and living back on the streets. She looks worse than she ever has, like shes withering away and I cant help her, she does not want help. She thinks shes ok and doing good. My question is how to talk to her and keep in touch without letting it break mine? Is it best to cut tirs for good? what if she needs someone to talk to and im not there for her? My biggest fear is hearing about her body found in a ditch somewhere mutilated and brutally raped and beaten. How can I help her without investing my whole heart? What can I do? I did contact people I knew for numbers if she did decide to get help but shes not even aware of the darkness shes enduring. \n\nHelp only comment if have serious answers Thank You",

Recovery centers, shelters, support groups, professionals, family and friends.\n\nBring multiple resources together as part of a strategy over a long long time rather than small, crumbling effort.\n\nPeople can spend their entire lives trying to get others help.",

            "comment": "Check in as regularly as you can personally cope with and is feasible. Consider gently bringing up dreams or positive visions of life you maybe talked about when growing up. Think about what motivated you to make changes as well as practical factors.\n\nOnce a local support network is in place and some momentum may be building (progress likely won\u2019t be linear as you will already know) consider inviting her to visit you away from her current situation. \n\nTry and show her that there are other ways to live but be thoughtful with targeted direct conversations as confronting past trauma and feelings of regret, remorse or failure can fuel avoidance and self destructive urges. \n\nWhen you can remind her you care about her but don\u2019t tell her what to do unless you think she\u2019s in a place she truly might respond to it.\n\nSometimes distraction or change can affect perspectives as much as conversations which her emotional self defences may reject. You could take a long walk with her in nature, introduce her to family or friends carefully or try something like a free pottery or art class, going to a fair or outdoor bandstand etc. \n\nOverall, hold on to the fact that we all have cards dealt by the universe but ultimately can only take responsibility for our own lives. \n\nAs you say this is not something to take on completely - lend her a shoulder to lean on when she\u2019s ready but avoid taking the weight of her life on your own shoulders. \n\nIf any efforts you make don\u2019t work internalise that it\u2019s not your your fault. \n\nYou are motivated to try and help now because you naturally feel unhappiness and guilt at her current situation but watch your losses - if things don\u2019t work out over time avoid adding more of these feelings to your life. Sadly the sunk cost fallacy can apply to those we love too. \n\nGood luck OP and congratulations on overcoming your own obstacles to a better life.",

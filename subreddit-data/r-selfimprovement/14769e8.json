    "postText": "Basically some of my flatmates over the last year have been stealing from me, regularly making a lot of noise late into the night, leaving a bunch of mess in the kitchen and generally being selfish and unpleasant to live with. \n\nI know it\u2019s better for me to let it go, and that being angry with them does nothing but I\u2019m still struggling to just let go of it and move on. \n\nI think it will be easier once I move out which I will be within a month, but I\u2019m trying to just except that it\u2019s a thing I have to deal with for now but I\u2019m struggling.\n\nThe hardest part is the sense of injustice, like why should they be allowed to behave like that?\n\nIf anyone has any advise I\u2019d love to hear it.",

I live with someone right now who drives me insane - to the point where I have to wear noise cancelling headphones constantly to not lose my mind. It's coming to an end soon and I can't wait.\n\nThe answer is to focus on when you move. Let everything else go and focus on that.",

I wouldn't turn it into a drama but I would definitely talk to Them about it, remindthem 2-3 times if it happens again and at some moment the point is reached  when moving somewhere else just becomes the better option",

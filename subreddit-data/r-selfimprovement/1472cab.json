    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019ve been a member of this sub for a short while now and I love it , I (25M) am currently going through some hardships after just being cheated on, by my now ex (2 years.)  Which is heartbreaking considering after the girl before her I promised I would never give my heart to somebody the way I did again because it will backfire, just like it has now. \n\nClearly I have poor taste in women. Anyway, just before we got together I was doing really well for myself, I was focused, making money and my discipline was improving by the day. \n\nFast forward too today my life has gone downhill, I\u2019m broken emotionally and financially, I have been falling in an out long states of depression and anxiety for months on end and self harmed more than I ever have in my life in the last 6 months. \n\nI don\u2019t want pity, I just wanna get back to being a KING, and I was wondering if anybody else who was experiencing hard times right now would like to communicate and find solutions together. \n\nThe current skills I\u2019m chasing are copywriting which I have recently just completed a course in, and a few other social media avenues such as short form video creation. \n\nI\u2019m also going abroad for the summer in 2 days and plan to stay as disciplined as possible whilst gone so would be good to have some people to motivate and hold each other accountable with. \n\nThanks in advance. And any advice how to get over this heartbreak would be greatly appreciated I will share anything you want to know about my self in the comments (if you care, lol)",

I read something recently that said during times like this it\u2019s best to not take into consideration how you feel emotionally, but logically where do you see this headed. \n\nAs you say, it is down to me whether I feel this pain or not and I am trying to put that into practice, because logically it\u2019s very hard to grow and become great with somebody you constantly cannot trust.",

    "postText": "So I'll cut to the chase here and put it pretty bluntly- I can have a terrible, toxic mindset sometimes and nothing I do can fix it seemingly.\n\nIt applies mostly to video games but sometimes (thankfully rather rarely) in real life. I guess sometimes I get far too into the heat of the moment and take it far too seriously. Best way I can explain it is with an example just recently that made me take a step back and realize I am a terrible human being sometimes.  \n\n\nSo recently in this video game I was playing there are three players against three players, which means of course you rely on your teammates. I love the game to death, I have a blast all the time when playing but sometimes I get so angry at my teammates who are simply just trying their best at it, and trying to have fun. But in my mind, I demand perfection (Which I also hold myself to as well, but frankly that's another issue for another day). It's very odd because they'll miss something that I consider so dumbfoundedly easy that it makes me want to rip them a new one.  \n\n\nAnd possibly the worst part is I realize that they **are** trying their best while I flame them, and I realize it's just a goofy game that will have zero impact on my life when it turns off yet I still hear the voice in the back of my mind \"They should be better, they should be ashamed, why are they so dumb when I could've been blindfolded and hands tied behind my back and could've done it!?\".  \n\n\nSo far what I believe I should be thinking is that they are simply trying their best to enjoy a game, winning isn't everything. And perhaps maybe instead of flaming them, I should try to improve myself at the game even more so that I can help correct those mistakes my teammates make so we can all win and enjoy the game. Yet this has plagued me for years, thankfully I've made at least a little progress on this as I used to be very much worse. But at this rate, I'll die before I reach my ideal mindset.   \n\n\nFinally, the main issue is that while I realize all of this the moment the heat turns up it goes right out the window- I simply don't care about being good or to follow my ideals. I just want revenge on \"the damn fools\".  \n\n\nSo basically TLDR: How on earth do I keep my healthy ideals in mind when dealing with an emotional moment both sad or angry? Simply realizing that people are trying their best and mean the best doesn't seem to help or any other tips from the posts I've researched.\n\nWhat's your ultimate trump card against your own evil?",

Eventually, it gets tiresome to listen to.\n\nMake jokes of your fuck ups, crack on with a friend and make one of their fuck up.\n\nFor example; I once played COD2 on a team with a group I became friends with. I would get angry with myself cause I couldn't keep up. I lashed out at others as well cause I didn't like that I was struggling. Until one of my friends started busting out in tears laughing as I died. I was pissed and annoyed at first, but that quickly faded as I watched my body in the kill cam slide across the floor smoother than Micheal Jackson in his dress shoes. Before vanishing off and half clipping into a wall.\n\nJust have fun. Fuck around, get dumbass ideas and just enjoy. Being competitive is okay. It's a challenge. It's a thrill. But it sucks when no one wants to hang out cause of fits of raging anger. Frustration is one thing, pure anger? Nah.",

I already attempt to follow that philosophy but slowly fucking around turns into getting fucked during a match andddd... despite my best efforts I eventually take things so seriously regardless of my initial mindset.",

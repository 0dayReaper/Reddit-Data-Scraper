    "postText": "I am a 33 year old man and I don\u2019t have very many friends. It wasn\u2019t always like this, i used to have a lot of friends when i was an avid skateboarder, as i was from about 10yo-25yo. Being a part of a niche community like this made is pretty much effortless to make friends and keep in touch, as we always wanted to go skate together. But as I grew up, I began to fall out of love with skateboarding, which emotionally distanced me from all the people I knew. I haven\u2019t found anything to replace this passion that I lost, so i feel like i have no interests through which to bond with likeminded people. I guess i have been depressed for a while and I am at the point where I am realizing I really need to put myself out there more and get involved in some sort of community. I am ready but I don\u2019t really know where to start. Could anybody give me some ideas? I\u2019ve always naturally gravitated towards engaging physical activity that requires a lot of skill development, so one idea I\u2019ve thought of is climbing. But I would also be interested in trying to cultivate other kinds of skills if I find it fascinating. Maybe let me know what your interests are? What makes you excited to get up on your day off work? Any input would be much appreciated.",

            "comment": "Thank you for being so vulnerable about this. I\u2019m sort of in the same-ish situation as you: I don\u2019t have very many friends and none where I am physically located. You might be sick of hearing this but volunteering is a fantastic way to meet other people! Of course friendships take time and nurturing but if you\u2019re also just feeling lonely, socializing and having mini conversations here and there could help out a lot as well (and lead to friendships!). What other skills are you interested in learning and is there an opportunity for you to learn said skill in a group setting? Or if you just want to chat feel free to message me because I am pretty confident you and are feeling pretty similar",

I mean i know there are infinite options i just don\u2019t have any idea where to start looking. I spent so much time so solely obsessed with skating that i really neglected other potential opportunities. I guess i would probably like martial arts, though i feel a bit old to start\u2026 i can see how volunteering could be good. What kinds though? Do you have any examples that you\u2019ve done?",

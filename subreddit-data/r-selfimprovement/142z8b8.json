Has anyone done it before or can link videos on how do it? I'm looking for more guidance and structure on how to use the power of words to shift my identity and reality. I:n also open to ideas on such a structure",

            "comment": "I found it's best to just start doing it every day.  Any advice or guidance I found I didn't end up following.  It's great to cultivate inspiration but with journalling, you basically write down what happened, and how you feel about it, and then challenge those feelings.  You can do this on paper, with a voice recording, with a video log, etc. In the end, figuring out the way I wanted to do it came from within.  That's what is practical anyways.  Nobody completes a task in a way that doesn't seem right to them.\n\nIf you are hesitating to start journalling because you feel unsure of the best ways to do it that is a mistake.  Get your thoughts and feelings expressed in your journal.  If you bottle them up they'll start bouncing around in your mind and they could sabotage your genuine feelings throughout the day.  Also if they are particularly toxic thoughts and emotions they can transform and worsen over time if they are not dealt with.  Get started and the complexity will be developed through the repetition of completing the task every day.",

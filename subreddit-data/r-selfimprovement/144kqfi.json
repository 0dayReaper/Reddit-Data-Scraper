    "postText": "I mean this in a very literal way: I often find myself feeling paranoid and scared of innocuous situations. I fear that people will  harm me. I panic about small situations (such as injuries, etc) and start thinking of the worst case scenarios. I just want to feel strong, in control. I want to live my life without this constant paranoia. Any tips?",

If you feel that this regularly impacts your quality of life, it could be an underlying anxiety disorder, OCD, or another mental health disorder. \n\nI struggle with something similar (although not the fear part) where I get chronic anxiety/intrusive thoughts about a lot of things, especially in times of stress. I later got diagnosed with OCD after it became too much to manage and I found out that a lot of the symptoms I experienced had aligned with OCD! I found that medication, therapy, and having a good support system has helped me greatly in overcoming these issues.\n\nI hope this helps in some way.",

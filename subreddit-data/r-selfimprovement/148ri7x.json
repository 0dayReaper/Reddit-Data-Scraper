    "postText": "So for the past year I\u2019ve really started getting into self improvment and doing a lot of hard work and Ive started getting more proud of myself. The downside is people seem to dislike me for some reason, at first I couldn\u2019t put my finger on why? Why did people ignore me or not want to hang more and more recently, but then I realized I think it\u2019s due to me being more proud of myself. It somehow triggers them or annoys them. Can someone explain why this could be happening? Do you get bad vibes or dislike people that are proud of themselves?",

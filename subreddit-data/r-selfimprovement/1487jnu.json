    "postText": "I\u2019m 27. When I was 13/14, I started having weird throat issues all the time. It felt like my throat had a lot of pressure in it, like a weird tension feeling, and the only thing that helped was when I ate/drank something or swallowed. This would help then it would come back a few minutes or so later. I had weird issues swallowing saliva too. I saw an ear nose &amp; throat doctor about this and was told my issue was acid reflux. Doctor prescribed reflux medication and told me to sleep on an incline. I did those things for a while, but it didn\u2019t help. Supposedly I was treating the issue and the doctor didn\u2019t know why I wasn\u2019t improving but told me to continue doing what I was doing to supposedly treat it. I saw some other doctors that weren\u2019t sure either. I pretty much learned to just live like that but it was annoying and started to take over my life to the point that every day revolved around coping with my throat and dealing with the bad anxiety it was causing. I used to avoid things, had no life, had to make sure I always had something to drink to help my throat, and felt really stressed about the whole thing and how it was affecting me. No one really knew, but I was really miserable all the time because of this stuff.\r  \n\r  \nAt 15, I started to feel like a brain fog on top of the throat issues. Something I\u2019d never felt before. It was like my brain felt like mush all the time, no matter how much sleep I got. Like the feeling when you sleep bad and feel like crap, except I was sleeping enough. Felt kind of spaced out constantly, couldn\u2019t concentrate as well, never wanted to do anything, apathetic, and just kind of crappy all the time. Wasn\u2019t severe but was definitely impacting my day to day life. I went back to seeing doctors. Lots of doctors said there was nothing medically wrong with me and some even said that the brain fog (and maybe even the throat issues) were all psychological. I didn\u2019t feel like that was it because my symptoms felt so real and physical but what did I know. I was prescribed antidepressants and doctors recommended I see a therapist for bad anxiety issues. I spent the next couple of years trying multiple medications, seeing therapists, and making other changes but nothing helped. I thought I was going crazy. In those few years that passed, I had slowly started to feel worse. By the time I graduated high school, the constant mental fog and tiredness were affecting me pretty bad. I felt stressed and anxious nonstop. Sometimes the anxiety was so bad I would literally start sweating. I had almost no life during high school because of it and did just the bare minimum to get by. With lots of doctors telling me there was nothing physically wrong with me, I started to believe them about it being all mental. I thought it was something I was doing wrong personally. At this point I wasn\u2019t even talking to my family about it as much since supposedly there was nothing wrong and it was all in my head. Especially when doctor after doctor were saying nothing was wrong and because my symptoms were mostly feeling tired all the time, what was I supposed to say? It felt like it was my personal fault for feeling the way I did. Everyone gave me the impression that my issues were because of me and I just needed to change my mindset and lifestyle and I\u2019d feel better. Positive thinking, anxiety workbooks, deep breathing, more sleep, take antidepressants, therapy. I did every single thing doctors and therapists told me to do, but nothing helped. Doctors and therapists made me question my sanity every day. It was hell.\r  \n\r  \nI was in no shape to go to college out of state, but I did. I ended up going because supposedly there was nothing wrong with me and I was trying desperately to believe it was all in my head like doctors and therapists and my family were saying. I just needed to change my way of thinking and lifestyle and that would cure the constant brain fog and tiredness and throat issues. So I pushed myself to go, hoping I\u2019d sort it out. I spent the next 4 years slowly feeling worse, still seeing doctors but getting no legit answers. I'd go months and months at a time without seeing a doctor as I didn't know where to turn and had given up at times. I'd also go back to thinking maybe it's all in my head, but at the same time my symptoms felt more severe than anything mental could cause. I saw a doctor about sleep apnea but didn't seem to fit almost any of the symptoms. Stuff like waking up trying to get air, choking, stopping breathing, snoring, wasn't overweight, wasn't unhealthy, didn\u2019t have a family history of it or other health issues. Still, I tried one of those moldable mouthpieces that\u2019s supposed to help with sleep apnea but didn't see any benefit from it. So with all of this, I figured it\u2019s probably not sleep apnea. I was so desperate, I was constantly trying all sorts of medications, supplements, and other weird things to try and help myself. I felt like I was losing my damn mind. My mental health was horrendous. Felt like crap 24/7. I literally felt stupid because my brain wasn\u2019t working. Dealing with symptoms and figuring out what was wrong with me consumed my entire life. I would occasionally go to class after taking a big dose of stimulant drugs, but even those only did so much. No amount of caffeine pills, energy drinks did anything either. I was beyond that stuff helping. I experienced almost nothing enjoyable in those 4 years of college and had basically no life, really no friends, hobbies, nothing. Really the only experience I had during college was when I went on a study abroad trip but it was hell because I felt so awful the whole time. I had also joined a fraternity in the beginning of college but did almost nothing with them for the same reason. The mental tiredness had gotten so bad it felt like I was disconnected and living in a dream. Like I felt kind of drunk. I was so mentally and emotionally numb and exhausted I didn\u2019t even feel human. Like I physically could not feel emotions and felt super spaced out. I was also still dealing with the throat issues. I\u2019d get random dizziness, my vision got worse like being more sensitive to bright light and bad floaters in my eyes, almost no libido. I somehow managed to graduate college and finished feeling significantly worse than when I began. I was so miserable and had no one to talk to about what was going on. But I was at least glad that college was over, because it sucked horribly.\r  \n\r  \nI spent the next year doing just the bare minimum to get by. About a year after college (2019), I had a sleep study done and results came back with moderate sleep apnea. For the first time I actually had an answer. Sleep doctor immediately prescribed a CPAP machine. Didn\u2019t even bother to wonder why a young healthy person has sleep apnea to begin with, because it\u2019s not normal. I spent the next 2ish years trying multiple machines, masks, changing all the settings, but only saw some improvement. Keeping the CPAP consistently on throughout the night was also a struggle in itself as it was super awkward and uncomfortable, even though I was desperately trying to make it work. When I was able to keep it on for 5+ hours a night I felt a bit better but it was really difficult to do so consistently. During this time I couldn\u2019t really hold down a job, other than some really basic, short term jobs. And even those felt brutal. My relationships with everyone were affected pretty bad. I was a complete zombie because the tiredness was so overwhelming. It was as an amount of brain fog and exhaustion I didn\u2019t know was humanly possible. I was making myself basically sick with stimulants that really weren't helping and even had a doctor at one point tell me that I should get genetic testing for depression or have my brain zapped with electric shocks. I luckily didn't go that route.\r  \n\r  \nAfter two years of messing with machines, my sleep doctor then recommended I see a maxillofacial doctor to see what the underlying breathing issue was being caused by. The doctor recommended I get a custom mouthpiece made that shifts the lower jaw forward to help open the airway to prevent breathing issues while sleeping. The process of having it fitted and made took a couple months. I even took a \u201creal\u201d job during this same time because I had two different doctors telling me that this mouthpiece was likely to help me a lot. I felt like I couldn\u2019t have gotten the mouthpiece fast enough. I ended up messing with the mouthpiece for months and had no benefit at all. Literally zero. The dentist who made the mouthpiece said that the mouthpiece wasn\u2019t helping because I might just have \u201cweak muscle tone\u201d in my throat and that I should see someone called a myofunctional doctor to supposedly improve muscle tone in the throat and tongue. I looked into that and it seemed like total quack stuff so I didn\u2019t do it and completely dropped that dentist that made my mouthpiece and suggested this. I then saw an ear nose and throat doctor and later did a sleep endoscopy with him where I was put to sleep and had my breathing monitored with a camera down my throat. The doctor said that my breathing issues were being caused by my throat and jaw and suggested that since the mouthpiece wasn\u2019t helping, I could get surgery or have a device called Inspire surgically inserted into my chest and neck to artificially help breathing. I held off on that cause it sounded pretty extreme and thought there had to be something else. During this time I had to leave the job I should\u2019ve never taken in the first place because I was so non-functional.\r  \n\r  \nI pretty much gave up for months. I eventually scheduled an appointment with another ear nose &amp; throat doctor (the same kind of doctor I saw when I was 13). I'd already seen many ear nose &amp; throat doctors by this point but didn't know what else to do. Don\u2019t remember how exactly it happened, but the connection was made that my issues were due to really abnormal nasal breathing. Something called nasal valve stenosis, where both sides of my nose were completely caving in and blocking most air, leading to crappy breathing, even when just breathing in lightly. This issue is worse during sleep and was causing my brain to unconsciously \u201cwake up\u201d every time my nose had the obstruction. So I was struggling to breathe all night and I was slowly feeling worse as I was never getting deep sleep. So the bad sleep every night just kept accumulating over the course of 10+ years. He also explained that my throat issues were a sign that my nose wasn\u2019t functioning normally, which was causing airflow issues and a throat pressure feeling as a result. There\u2019s nothing actually wrong with my nose itself. It\u2019s the middle part of the face that provides the base and support for the nose that is lacking the support needed to keep the nose open for normal breathing. Doctor said it\u2019s really abnormal for nasal collapse to happen like this as a result of the face just not developing properly. It was just the way the middle of my face grew and changed over time, especially during puberty, that led to this. Looking back, I used to breathe mostly through my mouth, but never knew it wasn't normal. Doctor said it is called midface deficiency. It\u2019s the area of the face just to the sides of the nose, below the eyes. Doctor said facial surgery is really what I needed but said nasal surgery could potentially help a bit and is less intense of a surgery, so I decided to go with that. Prior to the surgery the doctor had me wear a dilator in my nose at night to keep it open which helped incredibly. Everything finally made sense for the first time ever. I even recorded my sleep and sure enough I could hear myself struggling to breathe all night.\r  \n\r  \nLast year (2022), I had nasal valve surgery. It took a long time to recover from surgery and I still have to wear something in my nose when I sleep to prevent it from pinching shut as the surgery only helped a bit. I will still have to look into facial surgery to address the underlying issue as my breathing is still not great during the day when I\u2019m not wearing a dilator in my nose but at night I wear it and am good. Over time most of my issues have gone away. The slowly worsening constant exhaustion and brain fog and cognitive issues that started when I was a teenager. The severe anxiety and stress feelings I had since I was a kid. Throat issues gone. I don't feel like killing myself out of misery anymore. It was that obvious all along but untreated made my life constant torture to no end. Feeling horrible nonstop, slowly getting worse over the course of years, not knowing why, being told there was nothing wrong with me or that it was all psychological, trying all sorts of things with no benefit, and having my entire life be ruined was a mental hell I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone. I don\u2019t feel like my teenage years and a good part of my 20s actually happened because I was in such poor health physically and mentally 24/7. I wish I had been able to see decent doctors earlier, but obviously that didn\u2019t happen. I\u2019m not even sure how I wasn\u2019t able to make the connection myself. I think I was just so used to really bad breathing since I was young that I didn\u2019t know it was abnormal and had no reason to think I had some weird issue. I still struggle with the mental effects of I think living like this for so long. The depression and frustration about it all. Why did I have to have this weird specific issue that destroyed my life, why couldn't doctors have helped me sooner like that very first ENT doctor I saw at 13 years old, etc. This wasn't some small, annoying thing that sort of affected me. These issues consumed everything for more than 10 years. My life outside of this was total nothingness. It's surreal to even think about how my life has been for so long. Thanks for reading and maybe this can help someone out there.\r  \n\r",

I felt personally singled out for this horror by the universe. Then one day my sister said, \u201cWhy NOT you? Look at all the mothers whose children die in childbirth, or in horrible wars, or are laying wasting away in hospitals with terminal illnesses. It\u2019s not fair to them either.\u201c she said it lovingly, and I immediately got the point. In this life, we can\u2019t be sure why bad things happen to good people, and it\u2019s totally not freaking fair. We still just have to get up and keep on moving. Put 1 foot in front of the other, while trying to preserve all you\u2019ve learned from this experience-things that you never would have without it. Perhaps you\u2019re a more compassionate person than you would\u2019ve been. Perhaps this experience has happened to humble you, or to prepare you for something bigger in life. Who knows? Obviously you will need time to process this. And I do think it is helpful that you have written this post reflecting on your experience. I know it doesn\u2019t seem fair, but you\u2019re on the other side of it now, and you have a masters degree in enduring suffering and trauma. Who knows when that will come in handy in your life? Congratulations on finally getting this Problem solved, and while you will necessarily have to go through some  processing about it, (maybe even therapy?) Don\u2019t linger too long on.",

I had no sensation, could not move it other than in a rotation from my hip (which caused more problems down the line because that is how I had to walk for about a year and a half-2 years) and I had no idea why. I went to the dr and they just gave me a Walker which was at least very helpful. Eventually, a few weeks later after it went dead, I was staying with my parents and I kept falling because the leg would give out under me and I'd hit the floor. This one particular day, I had hit my head a few times, hard, when I fell and I have a history of concussions and also had ect so I gotta be careful with my head, I'm still recovering from treatment and was still dealing with the immediate side effects when this happened, so I went to the hospital in this tiny tiny Wisconsin town and asked to be checked out. This dr was a complete jackass and also just an idiot. He told me its \"impossible\" to fall while using a Walker, there is no clear indication that anything is wrong with my leg and he believed I was making it up, when I asked to be assessed for concussions or to just do an mri on my leg/back, he said he wasnt going to waste resources on me, even though It was such a small hospital i was the only patient in the entire er, and the er specifically had both an MRI and cat scan machine thingy, but he wasnt going to \"waste\" those resources on me and to just make an appointment with someone else because he doesn't have time for people like me. Wow, ok. He also worked in his class rank which was impressive, honestly. I know how important that is to those types of people, and how hard it can be to work into most all interactions you have. I admired his dedication to me knowing how impressive he was. I was truly in awe of this man's brilliance. Just wow. \n\nI ended up moving to where I live now and there is an orthopedic clinic down the street so I made an appt with them and it turns out my leg is just fucked. I had lost bowel and bladder control, for some reason my knee became all wild and free and moves around randomly now, I learned i have femoral mono-neuropathy and it's just kinda up to fate if it improves. They didnt understand why my knee decided it wants to relocate though. It's not an issue, other than the sound it makes when I move it, but it doesn't hurt. It's gotten somewhat better since it happened, but my leg is plagued with a constant it itching sensation that I can't relive and I still don't have most the feeling in the lower portion of my leg. Its super uncomfortable, I'm just glad I moved into my apartment when I did, because after a brief stint at a facility and at my parents, I was living in my car during the worst of it and had to learn to drive with my left foot. \n\nIt wasn't fun and theres no fix.  I can tolerate it pretty well, I use ice packs on it a lot and I sit with my feet flat on my bed so my cat doesn't accidentally put pressure on it because that is excruciating. I have little hope for more significant improvement, but hey, I can walk again, and I regained bladder control so I'm happy. I'll take what I can get. It keeps me up at night though which is just annoying",

I missed out on...all of it. Like my childhood and teen years weren't normal in any way, but at the very least, all of my adverse life experiences built character. And that character is i think one of the things that's allowed me to not only survive, but actually turn out to be (eventually...) actually pretty awesome person. Like not having a \"good\" experience for much of your isn't fair and no one should suffer through life, in my opinion. BUT just because you/anyone missed out on your \"youth\" in pretty profound ways because of what you were going through, it doesn't mean that you aren't going to be able to have awesome af experiences going forward. Youth is overrated if your ask me. The \"best years of our lives\" are so far from actually being our best. I love being 33 because i still feel like a teenager in a lot of ways and I look maybe 22 (which I still am hating how young I look and appear to be) so I feel like I'm getting a 2nd chance at being a youthful explorer of life as a 20something would but in my 30s, with more wisdom and insight and better decision making skills and less of a self destructive streak. So I figure it sucked to not have a normal life until my 30s, but it's a trade off I'm ok with because the crappy and weird stuff made me into a person I genuinely am happy that I get to be and it gave me so many skills and tools and tips and tricks to get through life in a really beneficial way. Idk its just my take on why it's not 100% necessary for me to hate all I've gone through and be accepting of my weird af journey and life story and instead have at least a tiiiiiny bit of appreciation for it, because it did me a lot of good. Just in really messy ways. But, building character is usually not a clean and easy process. Its messy by nature",

    "postText": "Hey everyone. So basically 2022 was a terrible year for me and I was like 2023 is gonna be my year. A lot of improvement has happened. I\u2019ve found God accepted Jesus into my life. Started working out, eating healthy, loosing weight, staying off social media, enjoying my own company and loving myself. Well today is a hard day and I haven\u2019t had one in a really long time so I just wanna write about it and would love some comments. So I have 1 friend which I\u2019m okay with but I\u2019m thinking about ending our friendship we\u2019ve been on our walk with Christ together but everytime we hang out she always says something towards me or about me that just hurts my feelings. I don\u2019t like conflict so I don\u2019t say anything some of the things she\u2019s said \u201c you\u2019re wasting your money paying 170$ a month for orange theory (workout classes), all (my name) wears is workout clothes, you don\u2019t know/ want to sit in the Stillness of God. I walked into her house today to get a shirt (back story I\u2019m a pool monitor at a pool so we can wear whatever we want) it\u2019s like 4 people in her house the first thing she says to me is \u201cThat\u2019s what you wore to work\u201d I feel like I\u2019m ALWAYS being judged. I always just give myself space from her to forgive bc that\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to do but everytime I see her again it just always happens. So secondly I met this guy earlier this week sweet, handsome, cool we had a conversation for 1.5 hours while he was on the clock. Exchanged numbers all of that sounds good right? So basically 2 days go by no text. So I text him and I\u2019m like hey how are you wet start texting he told me I enjoyed talking to you the other day. So I\u2019m like okay I started the convo good. Last night I was like goodnight he said it back.. book this morning I say good morning I hope you have a good day he\u2019s like thank you likewaise and I said thank you. He hasn\u2019t said anything else the rest of the day. Now a year ago this would\u2019ve hurt me really really bad but bc of the self improvement it dosent hurt it\u2019s just I don\u2019t know I really try to be authenticly myself and it\u2019s just like I feel like people aren\u2019t for me. I\u2019m sitting here in my bed crying and I\u2019m like I\u2019m done talking to people I\u2019m done I don\u2019t care I\u2019m done. But the thing is I\u2019m not that person and I don\u2019t want to be like that. It\u2019s just so hard when it feels like you\u2019re always being let down or the target. I think the friend situation hurts way more and the fact that I\u2019m going to a prayer brunch tomorrow with her is just upsetting me bc I\u2019ve been excited about it ALL week and now I don\u2019t want go. And the boy well he\u2019s a man he\u2019s 25 it\u2019s just like I\u2019m new to this dating as a Christian and I was like we really vibed but I don\u2019t wanna keep texting him first and bothering him. I know that all of these feelings are temporary and hey this may be the wrong place to post it but peoples opinions really just hurt the self improvement portion of my life.",

    "postText": "This is an update post one the one I made two months ago. TLDR: I've (24F) consistently had bad mental health episodes for the last 8 years of my life. Today marks my one year milestone of a year without a bad episode. I was worried I wouldn't make it but I did!\n\nThis time last year I was a totally different person. Single, unemployed, lonely, and depressed. I was in the middle of a particularly bad mental health episode and I decided I couldn't go on this way. So I changed my medication, went to therapy and self help groups and things started looking up. \n\nI got a job in march last year, I also got a boyfriend in march, we'll be coming up to a year in a month's time. Because of work I started making more friends. I also found a new direction to take my life.\n\nI graduated university 3 years ago, but I'm not sure what I want to do with my degree. But actually, I've decided to go in a completely different direction and try to become a tattoo artist. My new years resolution has been to put my art out into the world. And I've started my art Instagram and I've started building a portfolio to help me get an apprenticeship after lockdown. It's something I'm really excited to do. I hope I can do it.\n\nTo celebrate my milestone I took 2 weeks off work. In the time, I did a massive declutter of my room, I made homemade cheese, I cut and dyed my own hair. And I made myself a cake. I mentioned in my last post that a while ago I found a Tumblr post. In this post the girl said something along the lines of \"one day everything will be ok, and on that's day I'll make cherry pie\". And then a few years later she posted a photo of a cherry pie. Well this is that for me. One day everything will be ok, and on that day, I'll make cake. Well today is that day! I made myself a dulce de leche cake and it was amazing!! \n\nI've still got ways to go for sure. I'm still working on becoming a healthy weight. I kinda stopped trying to do that around Xmas. I'm still working on my portfolio. To be honest, although I haven't suffered with SAD as bad as I usually do. I've definitely felt lower. Like I've been hibernating. My motivation for my portfolio and weight loss stopped. But now things are getting lighter and I have this boost from my milestone, I'm going to kick myself back into gear. Brush off the cobwebs and wake up a bit. \n\nIf anyone has any advice for helping me wake up and come out of hibernation I'd really appreciate it. I need a good kick up the bum. \n\nThe last thing I have left to do, once I get paid this month, I'll be buying my friends, family and boyfriend small gifts to say thank you for their support during this year. I definitely couldn't have done this alone. No man is an island. \n\nHere's hoping this year will be as good as the last, I hope to see you back here in 2 years! Thank you for taking the time to ready my long-ass post, I appreciate it. \n\nTLDR: I made it one year without a bad mental health episode, it's the best I've ever done. I made myself a cake to celebrate.",

In case you ever find yourself in a tough spot again (though hopefully not), remember you put in all the hard work and effort to get yourself to a better place. And you will again and again now that you know what you\u2019re capable of.\n\nI don\u2019t have any major pieces of advice. Just know February is historically a rough month for pretty much everyone, so don\u2019t beat yourself up. Like you said, use the milestone as fuel to get you where you want to be. \n\nGood luck and again congratulations \ud83c\udf89",

But I think, I'm trying to be prepared for if I get bad, but not expect it. I've had a few coping strategies from therapy and support groups that hopefully will help. And I'll try not to beat myself up if things do get worse. This time last year I was beating myself up about starting new medication. But it was probably the best things i could have done for myself. It wasn't a failure on my part at all, although it definitely felt like it at the time.\n\nYeah February sucks. I try to remember this quote in February. \n\"February is the shortest month of the year, so if you are having a miserable month, try to schedule it for February.\" \n\nLemony Snicket",

I worried I would never see a day where I wasn't in pain and smashed by the boulder that is MH. Years of therapy felt like I was just spinning my wheels in the mud, never actually making changes that lasted or progress. Recently I have started to feel like I may be coming out of it. I have made real progress since switching therapists and I have noticed more consistency in my life.   \nIt makes me so fucking happy to see posts like this because I know how it feels to feel like you will never get relief. I hope the best for you. Keep on going, even if you hit hiccups.",

I'd be fine for a while but then it would get worse again. Cyclical. Sometimes it would be the same thing over many years that would make me get bad. Sometimes it was a whole new reason. I just always felt like I was kinda waiting, on edge for the next bad episode. I tried not to become a self fulfilling prophecy. I tried not to anticipate the bad times. But sometimes they come nonetheless. \n\nI think for me, finding medication that worked for me was a big step, support groups too, getting a job by far!! Life consistency is a big thing! I also cut out some negative people in my life. And also just time. Some traumas take years. \n\nYou got this friend!! Keep going! You'll get through it too. Celebrate all the small wins along the way! One day everything will be ok, and on that day, you will make cake too \ud83e\udd70",

But it's been a very lovely year for sure. \n\nIn fact I was so used to bad MH for so long, that I had a mini identity crisis. I'd internalised bad MH as part of my identity. It's was very liberating to realise that my bad MH isn't who I am. It's just something I've had to deal with. \n\nI think your future is definitely brighter than you thought.

Different medications, counselors, support groups, meditation, mindfulness, exercise, fresh air, socialising. I even changed religions. Although I'm not sure what I'm doing now is really a \"religion\" but I digress. \n\nIt's really a lot of trial and error to find what works for you. But some form of counseling online or not is probably a good place to start. As well as looking into medication if that's the route you want to take. Don't feel disheartened if something doesn't work for you. Just pick yourself up and try again. \n\nI have an SOS plan for myself now. For when I can feel that I'm going to get bad. A bunch of strategies to use to try to help myself before I fall into a depression pit. It took me a few years to figure out what works best for me. It still doesn't always. But it's better than nothing. \n\nYou got this friend. If you or anyone here would like a list of resources I've used that I've found helpful for depression, anxiety, self harm etc. I'm happy to leave a list. Be aware that a lot of this is UK based.",

Counseling is very good for finding strategies that you didn't know of before. \n\nI have an SOS plan now, full of strategies for when I can feel myself getting bad. I try to use that before I get too bad. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But it's better than nothing at all. Having SOS people and SOS locations where you feel safe is also a good idea. \n\nI think I've offered this somewhere before. But if you'd like a list of resources that have worked for me I'm happy to give that out.",

Dont worry about filling it, just put your best work in there. A portfolio is a living thing, it'll grow as you do. Draw your ass off. We want to see determination, and we're looking to see how your style will convert to tattoo (draw some typical tattoo subject material, such as skulls and roses, etc.). A good portfolio has balance.\n\nNext, dont worry about the rejection. Ego is a real problem among professional creatives, and if someone is looking down on you they probably weren't the teacher for you anyhow. Things will line up and you'll be where you're supposed to be eventually. Patience is the hardest thing to master.",

            "comment": "God i\u2019m so fucking proud of you right now. That is so challenging and incredible and beautiful. Serious congratulations on your incredible growth and triumph on your journey. For once I actually can offer advice! On a similar journey to yours i\u2019ve finally found a nice rest spot where I can look back and be proud and take a moment to be happy. I just made a post about it if you wanna talk more :) Anyway! My advice to you is to change the small choices you make. For a long time I felt the same. Like i was sleeping and letting life pass me by, and if there were awards in life i\u2019d might not even qualify for a participation one. But recently I\u2019ve taken a lot of good lessons to heart and changed my little decisions, in turn changing my habits and then my life. I\u2019m trying to put this shortly, so that little shpiel is my advice! Change the little seemingly insignificant habits/decisions in your life. Like what you eat, what time you do things, how long you spend on a phone, how many times you go outside, etc. The tiny decisions you make build habits, which build actions, which steer your life. So consciously putting an effort into making healthy decisions for yourself is the hardest and easiest way to change your life. Easy as in while doing this your life will turn around so quick, and it\u2019s easy to implement such small changes. But its hard too. To really put those healthy thought into action, and to be consistent in doing so, especially while overcoming mental stress. Still it\u2019s worth it, and it\u2019s turned my life around so much. I feel alive and for the first time in a long time ready to try. I actually want to participate in life and I have the motivation to work out and do art and the things that make me happy. I wish you all the luck in the world, and i also hope this comment makes sense. I be tired. I am so proud of you friend. With or without my advice i\u2019m sure you\u2019ll continue to grow and be incredible. Much love.",

I still have self doubt and feeling like I'm not good enough. But I think everyone has that, and it's not debilitating, like it used to be. I can work through it.",

It was internal healing and hardwork, rather than external factors that helped me in this last year. \n\nKeep working hard on yourself friend :) you got this!

This is based on universal law of attraction which take over to bring gf that you are seeking.\n\nYou must be confident and project an positive attitude with sense of humour , smile and laugh will attract women into your life.\n\nBe positive and expect great things will happen in your life and let universal law of attraction take in charge.\n\nBelieve me it does work.!!! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4c",

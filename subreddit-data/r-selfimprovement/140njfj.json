    "postText": "I find it very easy to put in 2 hours of studying during school days but when it's the holidays or the weekend I can't focus at all and do anything. I had my end of year exams right after the holidays last time and I did poorly in them because of it. How can I find it easier to focus on revision and my goals during the summer holidays in a month?",

So you can set it to send a timelapse studying for 2 hours every Saturdays and Sundays, or you lose $10, for example. I believe that will be a great motivator for you.",

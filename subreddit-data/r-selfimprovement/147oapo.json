    "postText": "I do it so many times and it's fking embarrassing to handle the aftermath. Note - this has never happened with any of my friends.(and I have very less experience while talking to relatives I mostly keep my mouth shut)\nLike just today my aunt asked me to drop her at the bus. So I called her for something else and then in the middle of the conversation I went - yeah aunt I can't leave you to the bus today. But there are 2 tomorrow at 12 in afternoon and 5 jn evening. Idk why da fk did I say that I wasn't thinking and things like this happens with me a lot of time \ud83d\ude2b. I didn't even notice it was rude till she pointed it out. I apologised to her and told her that I wasn't intending too and felt really sad about it.(I didn't really)\nI am so stupid.......... \nKill me \ud83d\ude42 because this embarrassment will",

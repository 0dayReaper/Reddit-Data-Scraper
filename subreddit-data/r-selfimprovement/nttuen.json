In reality (and this becomes more apparent as you get older), most people are seldom thinking about you.\n\nInstead, focus on the things that make you happy. Be the person that you want to become, not the person (that you believe) that others want you to be.",

I\u2019m also not able to smile with my teeth in photos, because my smile changes my face so much that I don\u2019t identify with the face I see when I do, so that\u2019s probably the biggest worry that holds me back from the life I\u2019d like to live. It ties into worrying what other people think, perceived norms engrained in me, I\u2019m sure. But unfortunately I wish not worrying about what I think was easier than not worrying about what other people think. \n\nI guess I\u2019m trying to say that it\u2019s usually not as simple as it sounds to be, not saying that you said it was easy or not, but I see this being said a lot and it lists out a truth of most, but not much help to those worries. It\u2019s more complex than that for most, even if it\u2019s clearly the thing that they should not be worrying about. \n\nIn reality, it\u2019s a concept of confidence in oneself that needs encouragement. So the phrase is read but it doesn\u2019t hit too much deeper than that to actually help those worries, until of course age catches up and people realize it on their own.",

Getting a job, getting a house/car, finding someone to love, etc is all dependent on me trying to influence the other person's thinking. I don't think there's a way any human can live without paying attention to what someone else thinks because that's how we survive in this society. We HAVE to care what people think of us just to put food in our bellies.",

Okay, try that and let me know how it works for you.\n\nTbh dude, nothing you're saying is news to me. I already know everything you're talking about. But it doesn't not apply for every day necessities. You know things that we actually need to survive on like food, water, clean air, and shelter. We all need money in order to recieve those things. How do we get money, we get jobs. How do we get jobs? By making a good first impression on someone; by making sure that someone who can hire us thinks highly of us. That's how society works. That's my whole main point and it just flew right past your head just so you can lecture me about something that I already knew.\n\n&gt;You can't tell someone that you are a hard worker, you can only show them by working hard. You cannot convince someone that you are capable of paying for a car, you can only show them by paying for that car.\n\nThis is not how reality works sir and you know it. You clearly have no idea what credit is or how it works. If you finance a car, not pay in full for it, someone is going to be looking at your credit score and income to determine if you can and will actually pay for it. Nobody gives cars or homes away to someone that's not willing to pay for them. You know this, why are you acting like this doesn't exist. How old are you?",

This is how the leaders of the human race decided how the world should be. We have to care about money in order to survive. We don't live in an era where there are no borders and everyone knows how to garden, sew clothes, make their own necessities, etc*. We don't live in a world where money doesn't matter. To act like we don't means that you're highly privileged and/or thinking too idealistically with not enough logic, common sense, and knowledge of how the world/people works. \n\nI am not saying that money is the only thing that matters. That's your perception of what I wrote. That's not what I said nor what I believe.\n\n*Some people already know how to do these things and are able to live off grid but you know damn well a good majority of people do not know how to do these things and if they want to learn them they need (I know this a shock) money; they're going to need money to pay for classes.",

Yeah sometimes strangers can be dicks and maybe once or twice someone will say something behind your back. Who cares. Almost every stranger in the street doesnt give a shit who you are and wont remember they ever saw you.

Sure we are humans with feelings but try your best to keep feelings close to the chest and not go willy-nilly giving fucks about people, especially someone who is rude cause hurt people hurt people. So if they don't really impact your life in any meaningful way, keep it moving, brush it off. At some point you have to grow a thicker skin and realize opinions are like assholes, everyone has one, unfortunately some of those assholes are vocal and rude without reason (not like you asked what they thought in the first place) so bite back   or take the higher road and ignore them all together, let them be the assholes they are proud to be. Just try not to take it personally as best you can, it's their problem, it's their bullshit, not yours.\n\nWhen I encounter toxic people or a toxic situation I say to myself **\"thank you for showing me what I don't want in my life.\"** never mistake arrogance and rudeness for confidence because it's quite the opposite.",

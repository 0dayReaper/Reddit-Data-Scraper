    "postText": "My favorite is called \"elimination of judgments\".  It works as follows:\n\nOne should always keep in mind that events are interconnected through the operation of physical cause and effect. Thus, apparently negative events can precipitate positive events, and apparently positive events can precipitate negative events. Moreover, the connections between events can be very indirect and impossible to predict. Consequently, if one were able to go back in time and modify or eliminate a particular event, one\u2019s entire life might change as a result, and whether it would change for the better or the worse would not be knowable.\n\nTherefore, one will generally never know whether an apparently negative event is truly negative in the overall context of one\u2019s life, or whether an apparently positive event is truly positive in the overall context of one\u2019s life.\n\nAs a result, one should eliminate judgments with respect to whether any event is truly positive or negative. Such elimination of judgments strongly promotes equanimity and peace of mind\u2014before, during and after one\u2019s experiences.",

They're constantly in use on an unconscious level. \n\nThe key is to start a daily practice that uses those mechanisms for what you actually want. \n\nIt's similar to effective learning. When you do focused, effective study, you trigger something in your unconscious called diffuse mode. \n\nDiffuse mode takes whatever you deemed important (ex. investing time and effort into trying to learn something) and keeps working at it in the background. If you ever wonder where those eureka moments come from, here it is.\n\nBut it's a two-way street. If you spend your time thinking about how horrible you are and mentally building on every example you can find, your unconscious is going to say, \"OK!\" and build on that. \n\nThe unconscious mind doesn't judge if something is good or bad. It simply takes whatever you've deemed important, sniffs it out, and presents it. \n\nThat's a MAD powerful tool, if you think about it. You can build a routine and train your way out of whatever problem you have or into whatever life you want.",

When you write, it's much for engaging for your brain.\n\nAnd when you immediately counter those thoughts, you're training your unconscious brain to understand that these thoughts don't serve you in the first place.\n\nWhen a thought comes up out of nowhere, it's your unconscious brain just pointing out something that it thinks you think is important. \n\nWhen the conscious brain ruminates, what it's essentially doing is telling the unconscious brain, 'This is important to me.' \n\nFor me, that led to self-hate. The thoughts that would bubble up for me would be things like, \"Stupid piece of shit\" or \"Dumbass...\", etc. \n\nAgain, the counter is to write it down and challenge it. I noticed a difference within a single page of writing.",

The civilian showed the man and the prankster pulled out a walking stick (for the blind) to which the civilian hugged him and was remorseful. \n\nThe vast majority of emotions don\u2019t have to do with sensations but the underlying judgments lead to emotions. It doesn\u2019t matter how \u201cshort\u201d someone\u2019s temper is if you do something they like for instance. In addressing the underlying judgment and seeing that our current judgment, though logical, isn\u2019t reasonable (reflecting reality) the way we feel can change. \n\nThis fact is actually the only reason why therapy can help as many people as it does. There are certainly physiological factors but it\u2019s all, more or less, co-mediated with our views on things.",

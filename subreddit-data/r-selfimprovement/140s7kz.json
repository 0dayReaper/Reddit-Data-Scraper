    "postText": "The title. Only time i really feel like i got any productivity is at night. \n\nMy only working theory is that i don't know how long I'll stay up. Meaning i can't really procrastinate. I think that I'll push to work as long as i can and once i can't no more, I'll sleep. \nMeaning there isn't any pressure either.\nI'll work for as long as i want to. And i have the excuse of tiredness if it turns out shit.\n\nSo a combination of not knowing when it'll end and less pressure.\n\nI might be completely off... \n\nDose anyone know why it actually happens?\nIt's probably something in my own phycology and asking you'll is a little silly.\nBut you're all welcome to speculate hah.",

There is also the safety net in case you mess up because you can just claim you were tired if things go wrong.\n\nIf you only get productive at night, then there might be something in that daytime that prevents you from being productive. It can be just that you are a night person, or it could be something that you can only get at nighttime whenever it's peace of mind, solitude, or something else.",

            "comment": "It probably is multiple things at the same time. I would say inertia is one factor, in the morning, sleep inertia, making it hard to wake up and get into a productive mindset. At night, the same inertia but in reverse, the inertia to stay awake and already awake enough to be in a productive mindset.\n\nOn top of that, I've also read about \"revenge bedtime procrastination\", it occurs when you're too busy and stressed during the day, leaving only a little time at night to do whatever you need/want to do. It makes you stay up later, working on stuff, or playing videogames or doing nothing, just for the sake of \"revenge\" of not having enough time for your stuff. It's mostly procrastination, whatever you do at night might as well be exchanging sleep hours for whatever you're doing.\n\nEnvironment is also pretty important, the peace of night is hard to beat, this is coming from a night owl, writing at 23:42 with less than 6 hours of sleep left, but feeling very peaceful and vibing.\n\nI would mostly blame it on sleep inertia, because I've felt just like you and I've made an experiment where I go to sleep early, wake up early and get some work done before work or on the weekends before everybody is awake. Putting aside how hard it was to change my sleep schedule and getting comfortable with it, on the weekends I'd done a ton of work by 9 or 10am. On the weekdays I would have already worked out by 7am, had breakfast and at my desk by 9am, lunch in hand, home made coffee in the flask, I had conquered the day before most people were up.\n\nYMMV, but there's a lot of people that swear by waking up at 3-5am and been done with their stuff by the time people wake up or it's time to go to work.",

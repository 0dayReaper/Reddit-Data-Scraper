    "postText": "I\u2019m stalling in life. \nI\u2019m 20 years old and am depressed and disappointed with myself. I only have my high school degree, 2 sources of income (two jobs) no car, I still live at home, I go to the gym 4-5 times a week, I do my meal prep but still I hate my life financially, socially and career wise. Half of my paycheque bi weekly goes to my mom because she\u2019s also struggling financially. I\u2019ve been struggling with what to do with my life. For almost three years now because I don\u2019t know what it is I wanna do. For those 2 and a half years I\u2019ve been working odd jobs. Quitting and just overall being very inconsistent. I only this year (2023) started consistently working hard and going to the gym. My main week job is a warehouse job. I really want to figure out a plan and quit that job asap. Cleaning a warehouse for minimum wage isn\u2019t worth it. Especially for the health risks I\u2019m getting. I dropped out of college in (2021) after my first semester because I felt that social science wouldn\u2019t have gotten me anywhere. Only now realizing it probably could have opened other doors for me. I went to trade school and dropped it after 3 months because I was physically weak for the work there and was bullied by bigger older guys there. I know it sounds kinda immature for someone my age but It\u2019s whatever. Even at my full time job that\u2019s happening. I\u2019m not happy. In my free time a lot of goes to video games. I have an addiction. As of recently I haven\u2019t been playing often but like I said above. I want to quit that warehouse job and figure something out. My all time goal is financial freedom.\nI like working at the restaurant on weekends because it helps me work on my social skills and it\u2019s actually a clean professional environment. I\u2019m also surrounded by good people. Compared to the warehouse m \ud83d\ude12 so could someone help me out with that please? P.s i get to my jobs using my parents car. What\u2019s the action here?",

Consider going back to college or trade school in a field that excites you. Also focus on improving your financial situation by increasing your income and saving money. Address your video game addiction by setting limits and finding healthier hobbies. And for setting limits i highly recommend you an app called forfeit. You need to send an evidence completing a task, or you lose money, so you can adjust it with your situation and you\u00b4ll be able to easily do it.",

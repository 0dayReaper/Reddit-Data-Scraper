    "postText": "I will be counting down from Day 100 and am hoping to build healthy habits on the below.\n\n\\- Spiritual (practicing religion)  \n\\- Working on Side Hustles   \n\\- Diet  \n\\- Charisma / Networking  \n\\- Mindset  \n\n\nWill this be ambitious? Most certainly. I fear that I am going to fail because there's a lot to do but I am hoping to set up systems in place to accomplish this. \n\nI also hope by putting a time constraint, I can make this work. I am doing all of these things to a smaller degree, but I am lacking the discipline to work on these things daily, rather than weekly and in some cases - fortnightly and monthly.  \n\n\nHas anyone else done something like this where they set time constrained goals? How did you go?\n\nAlso if anyone is interested in the progress, just comment on the post.",

She talks about new years' resolutions, but the advice she gives is relevant to any goal setting. \n\nIk it sounds counterintuitive, and it may not even change your mind, but I urge you to consider listening to what she says bc once you hear her out it makes a lot of sense! If it doesn't change your mind and you still go through with all these goals in 100 days, then you should feel even more determined in your decision.",

I definitely agree with the episode, and it has worked for me in different instances of my life.\n\nWith that being said, I am still going to stick with these goals basically to test whether I can completely re-invent myself in 100 days. Will I be able to maintain these goals? I don't know, but damn I hope I get closer than before. \n\nIts definitely going to be hard as I have tried something similar before and have failed. But will try again with a different approach and see how I go.",

Some magical day \u2013 when I'll be more fit, when economy wouldn't be as bad, when covid will pass etc. It's about overfocusing on destination, and meanwhile, just holding on, clenching my jaw. (Needless to say and everyone knows, that magical day would never come).  \n\n2. Start to think on how improve the process right now, and not your destination point. If you can take a day off right now \u2013\u00a0do it right now. If you can help yourself in any other way right now \u2013\u00a0don't wait for your wellbeing to worsen. Even if it's silly, like a toy from Happy Meal, but it'd cheer you up, please, give yourself that little thing.  \n\n3. Stop hoping for one quick or easy solution to overcome the burnout (in case you do). Despite of what majority of self-help influencers are telling their followers, levelling up does not come easy. Any progress in therapy and meditation takes years, and you'll have a set backs almost inevitably. But sometimes people hate to hear this and are looking for an easy overnight fix.  \n4. See you burnout as a blessing. As your mental immune system is telling you \"you can't go like this, we need to change something in our life\". This is a great opportunity to correct your path. Trust me, it would be so much worse, if you'd move through your life without any awareness at all. This feeling really sucks, any probably it won't be easy, but you'll find your way out. And then you will look back at this thread, celebrate how far you've come. And how great you are.",

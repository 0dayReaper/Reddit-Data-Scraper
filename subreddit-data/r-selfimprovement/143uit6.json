    "postText": "I always find myself alone. Even with my with friends, I still feel alone. In this case I know why, I\u2019ve (21F)  had the same friends for the past 10 years, they are family at this point. We grew up to be pretty different, with different goals and visions. But this is all I\u2019ve really known for half my life so it\u2019s easy to just kick it with them and be comfortable. I do feel like there is something missing in me, and I can\u2019t quite pin point it. I have the hardest time making new friends, I would say I\u2019m socially awkward. People come up to me and introduce themselves in the hopes we will get close but it never happens, I\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s my fault,  it\u2019s something about the process of getting to know someone I rarely have the energy for. I guess it\u2019s a redundant question because I am alone because I choose to be\u2026 to an extent. I don\u2019t put much effort in other people. But there\u2019s a reason, I never feel like I connect with anyone. When I do decide to go out and be social, I regret it afterwards. I rarely enjoy myself but I play it off as if I\u2019m having a great time. I tend to just stay at home by myself with my dog, sulking. Depressed. I have no one to call, to vent, to truly understand me. Because I don\u2019t give anyone the opportunity to understand me. I don\u2019t have social media, I\u2019m not in school anymore, I don\u2019t know of any group I would join and actually enjoy it and meet people at. So I come here, to Reddit, because venting to strangers feels pretty good actually. And you guys always give some great advice (at times harsh but the truth isn\u2019t always pretty). I know I want to change this feeling. I\u2019ve thought about maybe I don\u2019t like myself? Maybe I really am depressed? Or maybe it\u2019s something about your early twenties that you kinda lose yourself a little. All I know, is I\u2019m sad lol\u2026 lack of a better word. All the time. I have my reasons due to how I grew up. But I know I want to change. Anyone been through this?",

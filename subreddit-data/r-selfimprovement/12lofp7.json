    "postText": "25 m, never had a girlfriend, first kiss, sex  before. I\u2019ve always have found myself getting rejected by girls, told that I was only seen as a friend / better we stay as friends / telling me that she don\u2019t want me to get hurt/ you know, the same old shit nice guys are always told.  \n\nIn January I was seeing a girl that I really liked and one night I sent her a dumb drunk text about \u201cdon\u2019t waste my time\u201d because I suspected that she had a boyfriend that I didn\u2019t know about. I did apologize for the drunk text and we were able to get on talking terms again but it looked like she only seen me as a friend when we were talking and I almost lost a friend because of the shit I did. To make things even more worse, we are coworkers and see each other every day. \n\nI got tired of being seen as the nice guy. I\u2019ve got tired of lacking confidence. I\u2019ve got tired of allowing myself to be put in the friendzone with girls that i want. \n\nSince January I\u2019ve cut down on alcohol, never got drunk since then. Went for as long as 65 days without any alcohol and have only drank no more than 1 beer on nights when I did go out. Also, I signed up for the gym and have been consistently working out 5 to 6 times a week for 2 hours a day. Eating lots of protein. Cut out porn. Cut out sodas and drinking more water. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 4 months and many people have noticed how my body transformed, many people have noticed how I feel more confident about myself and how I\u2019m always happy because I\u2019m taking good care of myself. I feel so good about myself that I posted a picture of myself shirtless after a workout on my story and it caught attention from so many friends, even from girls that stopped talking to me. \n\nThe girl at work that I was talking to 4 months ago started getting close with me again when I just offered to help her with moving stuff into her new apartment and I gave her a chair because she asked if i had  some furniture to get rid of. It was her idea to hang out for a little while. We \u201changed out\u201d for like 3 hours.  It seemed like we were just talking as friends and then I asked her out and I made my intention clear that I want to take her out on a date and she said yes.\n\nThe date went so well. At the end of the night I gave her a rose and went for the kiss when I was going to drop her off at her home. And after that kiss it just escalated to an all out make out session and cuddling up in the back seat of my car for 4 hours!!! And I just came back from our second date that ended in the same way. We\u2019re dating. I feels gooood\n\nI did it!",

Woman are not going to be good \u201cfriends\u201d for most men. And before you say \u201cwell women can do x,y,z in a platonic relationship with a man\u201d ask yourself those same things your about to list couldn\u2019t I just have a male friend. Who actually provides value like the things I just named, but also brotherhood, and certain understandings about dealing with the opposite sex etc. Basically ladies im tryna put you on. 98% of the guys who talk to you want to fuck. They might go the \u201cfriend\u201d route or be direct but men dont have real use for women as friends the majority of time. Lastly im not just boiling women down to sex, you can be in a sexual relationship with a woman and be her BESTFRIEND but it needs to be you and that man in a sexual relationship or it wont work.",

For one just because of shared experience, men relate to other men better, just like women relate better to other women. And also of course because if a guy is single he's typically looking and if his friend is attractive and also single and they get along well then there you go. That's not as much of an issue for women because it's primarily on men to do the looking in the dating world.\n\nEdit: Jeez what did I say to get all these down otes lol. Did I  something offensive? Wrong? Genuinely curious. Not saying this is an absolute rule btw there are plenty of exceptions. I do have female friends and I'm not trying to sleep with them. I still like hanging out with them but I'll always have to have guy friends too cause there's just certain things that are hard to have in common with most women and things they don't have in common with me.

And the girl apparently likes him, since they\u2019ve been on multiple dates, and she more than likely knows him a little better than you. \n\nAlso, so he\u2019s been influenced by internet memes about \u201cnice guys\u201d and \u201cfriend zones.\u201d He doesn\u2019t really give off the entitled vibe which is the essence of the monster-type nice guy. I think he was using the term more in the sense that men are sometimes shamed or ridiculed as being too nice as the reason they\u2019re not interesting to girls. \n\nAll that is to say, why snap to judgement in a support group? The guy worked really hard and saw his life turn around in a positive way, and he wanted to share. There\u2019s a time and a place for calling people out for bad behavior, and admitting to sending a mean text once when drunk isn\u2019t really fair grounds to undermine someone\u2019s success with quitting drinking, getting healthy, working out and getting a girlfriend for the first time.",

Hell, he is hitting it 6 days a week for 2 hours a session, changed his diet too. I don't think this is too far off. Maybe transform was too strong a word, but I'd be willing to bet you would see an obvious change. I've watched a good friend of mine go from 145 to 160 just bulking up muscle in just over 3 months and he looks vastly different now....newbie gains, but still gains. \n\nIf you don't have the muscle to begin with, it's not hard for people to see an early transformation in a few months of hard exercise.",

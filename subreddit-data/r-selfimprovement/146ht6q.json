I don\u2019t know how to budget. I\u2019m morbidly obese with binge eating disorder. I\u2019m mentally weak. There\u2019s so many things wrong with me that I don\u2019t even know where to start. I\u2019ve tried so many times and all I\u2019ve done is failed.",

Actually this is great news because the first step in the process is identifying the goal you\u2019d like to achieve.\n\nCome up with comprehensive strategies for each of those notions. \n\nFor example, every week write down your subscriptions and every week consider what you don\u2019t need and every week aim to cut at least one thing off until you have positive cash flow.\n\nAs for weight, get informed about your eating by counting calories with an app like \u201cLose it\u201d. You\u2019ll find you\u2019re simply eating too many calories. Drink 2.5 L water a day, substitute foods for bags of carrots and lettuce, conserve your energy, challenge what it means to conserve your energy, all as facets of a strategy you implement for example.",

Relationships with people and family, job opportunities, shit I even had to retake some classes in college and I\u2019ve tried a lot of things( YouTube channels anime &amp; manga, basketball) \nfailed. We can\u2019t give up. Even if we were to fail for the rest of our lives we have to keep going so as long we\u2019re alive. \n\nI believe one of the most important things you could learn to do in life is cope in a healthy way. Bad things our bound to happen to us in at least one avenue in life or another for some multiple they can\u2019t catch a break no matter what. \n\nIt\u2019s all about forming better habits and picking up on certain urges like binge eating. This is exactly why you need to focus on your mental health at the moment. Start meditating and journaling. Exercise helps with mental health so try to add that into your life whenever you can a walk or weight lifting whenever you can.\n\nIf you have money seek a mental health professional like a therapist or counselor. And just try to take care of yourself and hopefully things change. No matter what please don\u2019t give up on you. It\u2019s hard out here it really is which is why I sympathize with you and could really feel you. But we got to be there for ourselves as nobody else will. Stay strong you got this.

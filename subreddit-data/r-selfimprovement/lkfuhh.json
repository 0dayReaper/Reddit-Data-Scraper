You will get out of there. You don\u2019t need the perfect body. Learn to love yourself, it takes a while. I\u2019m proud that you are holding the stand right now!\n\nEdit: Also my Post blew up, so I got that going for me, which is nice.\n\nThank you all! You are amazing!",

But diet can do more for you. I suggest food that keeps you full for a long time (very dark bread, stuff like that) that avoids insulin highs, gives you energy for your day (keeping you sane) and is transformed slowly. I mix milk sugars (lactose) with carbohydrates. Milk sugar is free after 30min, carbohydrates after two hours. \n\nAlso cardio cardio cardio! If you don\u2019t have much muscles, Build some first so you have a tool to burn fat more efficient. Then: long walks, riding the bike, jogging. You don\u2019t have to be fast, you don\u2019t have to be good looking, you only have to be consistent. \nStart slowly, so your joints and tendons have a chance to adapt to the new stress, you wanna keep that shit healthy and functional more than having new muscles.\n\nAlso: there are reasons you are how you are right now. And that is fine. Everybody has a upbringing we can\u2019t control and a lot of behaviour from that sticks.

Lol Yes a loving relationship can definitely help your mental health but your motivation for doing is just as important as the action. If the motivation behind going into the relationship was; I want to give this person unconditional love as opposed to \u201cI don\u2019t want to be lonely\u201d. That makes a whole lot of difference to your mental health. With one, you\u2019re not looking for the cause of your loneliness and instead dealing with the symptom. With the other reason, healing from loneliness comes as a byproduct of love.\n\nAlso how do you give someone unconditional love if you can\u2019t give that to yourself?",

That is important for a relationship, while it goes the other way around as well. Multiple times now I saw friends of mine, who struggled with themselves (depression, burn out, bulimia) who profited hugely from their new relationships back then. You never really know if a relationship will be good and I find it kind of illogical to stay out of one just to build yourself up. I think it\u2019s much more easy to give unconditional love to other people than to yourself, since we as humans tend to be more okay with the flaws of others and less with our own.\n\nI also saw cases of people going into relationship just because they can\u2019t be alone, turning out dysfunctional but keeping it up never the less. \n\nMaybe it comes down to self reflection? Why do I want to be with that person? Because I\u2019m lonely? Or because I love this person?\n\nThat\u2019s my thought process so far, maybe you can take some out of it, or maybe you disagree. Don\u2019t hesitate to, I\u2019d like to hear your opinion on this!",

And yes I\u2019m focused on the motivation for getting into a relationship. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to stay out of one to build yourself up. But it\u2019s a disservice to you and to the other person to get into one AND stay in it with the motivation of \u201cnot being lonely\u201d.\n\nAnd I believe you can\u2019t give what you don\u2019t have.     The whole point of loving unconditionally means that love is not dependent on whoever is receiving the love. It solely depends on who is giving the love. And you can only give to the extent you have or have built inside of you, well unless you borrow love from someone. Lol bad joke. Hahaha I\u2019m so funny...Not. \ud83d\ude02\n\nOk back to being serious.\nSometimes we see the expressions of love and confuse it for love. Let me explain. Someone can only be infatuated with you and express affection, care, go the extra mile for you, sacrifice for you etc. But it\u2019s possible that, inside, those actions don\u2019t stem from a place of unconditional love, there might be other motivations behind those actions. But those are all expressions of love aren\u2019t they? To care , sacrifice, show affection etc. So it\u2019s easy to see these expressions and easily assume that they are from a place of unconditional love (or from the extent of love that person makes you believe they have for you) meanwhile the real motivation is just infatuation or fear of being alone etc. \n\nAnd lastly, I believe love is not a destination to get to. It\u2019s a perspective you walk by every day, something you receive and learn from others, make conscious decisions to grow into it and then make choices to reflect that. So you can be at any point in your journey and give someone the extent of the love you have and then keep\nlearning to grow in unconditional love. It\u2019s like a river that flows, as Opposed to a pond that stays still. And as you grow in unconditional love, I mean really grow, you\u2019ll find yourself receiving (from yourself)what you have built inside of you and like that river flow, it goes to other people.\n\nYou can be depressed, lonely, all these things and still have love in you and are building unconditional love but \u201cbuilding love\u201d pretty much is...learning every day to grow the \u2018unconditionality\u2019 of the love in you. \n\nAnd I believe an expression of love is; examining the reason why you\u2019re in a relationship. Is it out of fear of being lonely? Or because you truly love? Or a bit of both? There\u2019s always an opportunity to learn and grow the love in you to be more unconditional.\n\nPeople express love in different ways but it\u2019s about the heart behind why you do the things you do. And no I don\u2019t think you can give someone what you don\u2019t have in you. \n\nThis is a whole book haha but I like our conversation. So tell me what you think.",

A lot of planking as well.  And crunches (not sit ups! \u2014&gt; better for your lower back).\nI made the maximum of each. After that I halved the numbers and try to reach it 4 times in a row (4sets), with the last set going into maximum numbers again. \nNot su much for the legs atm, because my ankle is doing weird noises from overstressing last year.",

I was suicidal too at some point. I got therapy and ended up coming out of it. \n\nNowadays, not even being infatuated over a girl gets me down anymore.

I\u2019m now around 74/75. since I wanted to primaraly gain muscles, it took a long time to get the weight on. Around two years with the biggest gains in year one. Stick to it and eat. Carbohydrates work like MAD for this.  I don\u2019t eat meat, plain vegetarian, which seems to be good for muscle growth as well. (Unsure about this, but the documentary \u201agame breaker\u2019 on Netflix was highly informative on it)",

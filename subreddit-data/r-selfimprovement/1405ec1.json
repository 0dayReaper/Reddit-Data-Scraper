Not mad, just realizing this has made me realize I still have a long way before I truly reach the top.\n\nDoes anyone else share this experience? Where they think they\u2019re the best but are in fact still weak?",

What helped me with this aspect was an app called Forfeit, which i need to send an evidence completing each of my tasks, otherwise i lose a certain amount of money. After some time using it, i don\u00b4t even need it anymore for all of my tasks, since it became an habit.\n\nBut the most important is never giving up and trying not to think about the \"long way\" you have, just focus on now and this way it\u00b4ll definitely be easier for you.",

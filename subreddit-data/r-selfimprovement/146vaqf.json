    "postText": "ANY ADVICE PLEASE!\n\nHello, I hope everyone who sees this post is well. I am in search of some advice following what has been a pretty challenging few years for me.\n\nTo provide some context - I am a 28 year old male I am a healthy person, exercise regularly, eat healthy. I have been suffering with anxiety and depression (mainly anxiety) for a few years now, following some stressful work environments, and the pursuit of purpose. The journey over the last few years has been tough, although I am extremely grateful to have amazing people around me who have provided immense support.\n\nI have been regularly seeing a therapist, and have partaken in some different forms of subconscious therapies to target some past traumas and self sabotaging thoughts that reoccur. Whilst I am in a great place, I have been unable to come out of fight or flight for some time. Have difficulty sleeping well, and often have a tingling sensation throughout my body and shallow breathe regularly. \n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice or recommendations on how you or someone you know were able to calm your nervous system and remove yourself from fight or flight.\n\nThank you!",

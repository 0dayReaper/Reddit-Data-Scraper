    "postText": "Hey all, \nI work an office job where my typical shift is 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM, which is cool, however my commute is one hour and in order to have a bit of time to get ready I have to get up at 6:30 AM. I've tried to do 6 AM, but I physically can't get out of bed. \nAny tips to maximize my time, and perhaps offload certain things onto the evening/Sundays in order to prepare? \nSince I recently moved, I've felt so overwhelmed trying to keep up with things at home. I struggle with depression and most weeknights I don't have motivation to do anything except lay down. I want to have a concrete routine so my weeks don't feel so impossible. \nAny advice is appreciated.",

One thing you can try is using the Forfeit app. It's a cool app where you commit to completing a task and if you don't provide evidence, you lose some money. It can add some accountability and motivation to your routine.\r In terms of maximizing your time, try prepping things the night before like laying out clothes and packing lunch. Also, use your commute to do something productive like listening to podcasts or planning your day. Don't forget to prioritize self-care and delegate tasks if possible.\r Oh and remember that it's okay to have off days and take breaks.",

            "comment": "Do you have any control over your lunch hour? Sometimes it's possible to fit in a work out at lunch or other habits in the middle of the day, then you finish work a little later and can skip traffic somewhat.\n\nIf you can get podcast/audiobook in while driving and squeeze value out of that time then that's a plus. Or if there's calls you have on a regular basis that you could have while driving that saves time also. You can practice deep breathing while driving to lower stress and it kind of counts as a mindfulness exercise/meditation. You could maybe use voice-to-text to journal some thoughts as you drive home into a google doc, depending on how much focus you need for your drive.\n\nMeal prepping on the weekends saves time during the week. Habit stacking is taking one habit and always doing it right after something else you were already going to do anyway (like   adding a gratitude practice before you eat dinner, since you're going to do that anyway and it's an easy reminder).\n\nIf you have specifics about the habits you want to be regular about I could give more targeted advice. Two hours a day on the road is a lot and depression is brutal, so sorry you have to deal with that. Wishing you all the best!",

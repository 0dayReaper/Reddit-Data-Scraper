    "postText": "\nEver tell yourself I\u2019ll do this task today but it leads to tomorrow yet you still don\u2019t do it, but in the back of your mind you still keep worrying and overthinking about this same problem all day long. It\u2019s like I\u2019m making my own life harder than it already is. At times, I ask myself like what the heck is preventing me from doing anything. I guess I\u2019m lacking a sense of direction and purpose in life. Maybe feeling confused and overwhelmed is normal for many people because we\u2019re realizing that we need to work on life. Whether it\u2019s finishing college, getting a job, learning a skill that could help us get better opportunities for work, yet we realize all the things we need to do then how come we feel still lost and more confused. \n\nWe seem to have energy but overthinking and worrying drains us mentally/emotionally. We don\u2019t put our 100% effort in anything we do. So we try to do other things that isn\u2019t relevant from our actual tasks that needs to be completed. That level of discipline and importance fades away as we become careless even though this is not our intentions",

            "comment": "If we wait until we feel like doing the hard task it will not get done. Another problem is that we have a checklist of outcomes not of actions. \"Get new tires for the car\" is good but \"Call three locations and get tire quotes\" is better. The best would be to have the locations and numbers picked out. \n\nI know you're not looking for advice but I will say I once found myself, like many people do, in the same rutt. You have to look at a goal and ask yourself \"What is the absolute minimum I am willing to do to advance toward my objective?\" It could be as small as googling the number of the closest store and writing it down. Most of the time we wait to feel motivated or until an opportunity presents itself before taking action. Those who push forward despite their feelings are the ones who reach their destination.",

            "comment": "One trick that might help is breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Take it one step at a time and set realistic goals. And if you need an extra boost of motivation, you can try using the Forfeit app. It's this cool app where you set tasks for yourself and if you don't complete them, you lose a bit of money. It adds a bit of accountability and might help you stay on track. Give it a shot and see if it works for you!\r Also, remember to give yourself a break and not be too hard on yourself. It's normal to feel lost and confused at times. Take the time to explore different interests and hobbies.",

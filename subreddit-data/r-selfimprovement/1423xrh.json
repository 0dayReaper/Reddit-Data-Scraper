    "postText": "I constantly work on my self improvment but one thing i can\u2019t improve for years is that I can\u2019t work with people. Specifically I can\u2019t work in the office surrounded by them. I tried a few times and on the outside you can\u2019t tell I have a problem, I finish the job, talk with people and I even make jokes here and there (cause I am afraid of how the collective will think of me ) \nBut on the inside I get panic attacks, I get really depressed I cry all the time. I got gerd problems the last time cause I couldn\u2019t stand being around so many people and hiding my true self. I just don\u2019t want to talk to anybody and I would love to be a ghost just finish the job and go home. But I can\u2019t my job requires a bit of talking and I didn\u2019t know I would be like this while I was finishing my degree cause I never had that problem in college. I was quite the opposite. I don\u2019t mind people in my other spheres of life just the office thing. Now the logical solution would be work remote, true ,but I have significantly less amount of money and less job opportunities in my country, close to none. I think sooner or later in life I would have to suck up and go to the office but I see it as torture. Any advice would be helpful.",

Whatever is making you feel panicked around people should be addressed. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but i can kind of relate to the feeling and that is all the input i can think of.",

    "postText": "2 Years ago I started getting onto self improvement and all the good habits talked about. I was very deep within the rabbit hole and tried everything and was very influenced by the influencers in this area. My whole life started to revolve around the idea of constantly improving and letting go of bad habits and negativity and such.   \n\n\nBut the thing is, recently, I've started to not know who I really am anymore. I listened to influencers talk and preach their philosophies on life and I believed them and felt like I wasn't thinking for myself anymore. For example, I completely stopped playing video games, even though it wasn't recking my life and I did find it fun occasionally. But now I can't play at all without the guilt of thinking I am a hypocrite to my own beliefs. I can't drink, do anything \"fun\" related that I would do with my friends occasionally without the guilt and thinking I am a hypocrite. It actually sucks. The biggest thing is that I have felt so lonely because I started pushing my close friends away because I though they were bringing me down because they had no value to offer since they played video games, drank and weren't on the \"Self improvement grind\" like I was.   \n\n\nRecently, I've started to question who I really was because I realized, I do enjoy these activities at times and that I am not living true to myself. I realized that in a way self improvement isn't all this happy amazing place to be because in the end it still isn't fulfilling. Even though I have a body I'm proud of, I have taken care of myself better, it is never as fulfilling as knowing who I really am and want to do, what kind of people I want in my life and want things I enjoy. I felt like I was in a trance with all this influence and that I was on autopilot this whole time just doing and thinking in a way that felt like a facade. It made me feel very distant from my pre self improvement friends as I just feel so hypocritical whenever I am not doing or saying something self improvement related. I feel so lost right now, everything I thought was right feels not quite anymore. I don't know what to think.",

It\u2019s always important to be yourself, no matter who you are, so do what\u2019s best for YOUR life, not the self improvement gurus\u2019.",

I totally understand how it can make you feel lost though, you\u2019re in a state where you\u2019re reflecting on your decisions a lot differently than you thought you would. Gradually let yourself do things you want to enjoy- something you think might make you feel guilty. And over time it when nothing bad happens you will realize there\u2019s no reason to feel guilty. I hope that makes sense. Just know everything will be ok \ud83e\udd0d",

            "comment": "Engaging in self-improvement can sometimes lead to an identity crisis. The process of self-reflection and growth may challenge long-held beliefs and values, causing confusion and uncertainty about one's identity. It's important to embrace this discomfort as an opportunity for self-discovery and to seek support from trusted individuals to navigate the crisis and emerge with a stronger, more authentic sense of self.",

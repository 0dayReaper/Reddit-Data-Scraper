    "postText": "I\u2019m on a vacation out of the country for 2 weeks to visit family. When I come back I\u2019ll be starting my first job ever. I scheduled therapy appointments, doctors appointments and nutritionist appointments as well. I am a 5\u20197 brown 25yo male who\u2019s a virgin(yes all major red flags). \n\nI don\u2019t wanna be a walking red flag anymore. I\u2019m gonna restart my diet and work twice as hard in the gym, pushing myself till my absolute limit. I\u2019m gonna push my doc for testosterone injections, and gonna go to a nutritionist to see how I can help my metabolism. I\u2019ll go to a therapist to find out why I\u2019m such a piece of shit. \n\nHonestly I\u2019m happy in life. Not much but I have 2 friends, I completed a doctorate and am starting a job I\u2019ll love. I know what needs to be done so I could be at the average male\u2019s level. But the fact that I\u2019m a virgin for so long, is more similar to being a rapist than a good person.\n\nPlus how can you increase confidence if you never never had any dating or intimacy successes?",

            "comment": "Long post here, but it might help you.\n\nWell, woman here, and you can be a chubby non-tall virgin guy and still be very charming and/or confident. Real human women people existing in real life care about safety and your behavior more than anything. They care about humor, respecting that THEY are funny, and most of all- treating them like respectable people.\n\nHaving women, bipoc, and LGBT people as friends is a green flag. Exhibiting empathy is a green flag. Educating yourself on diverse people and issues is a green flag. Being able to joke in non-offensive ways is a green flag. Apologies are MAJOR. \n\nIn general, the vibe your post gives off is that you're perhaps insecure around non-virgins. My best tip for that is to educate yourself and stop being surprised in convos. Approach everyone normally. Don't put any pressure on attraction or romance.\n\nAnd never, ever, compare yourself to a r*pist. That one comment is literally awful and tells me you have a really awful and socially unaware mindset. And you said it with your whole chest. As if it's accurate, number one, and as if you're okay comparing yourself to that. It's a privileged ass mindset tbh. It tells me you're isolated as hell. You're not alone in your problems, but what a slippery slope.\n\n\"People make fun of me and it makes me feel bad, so they must treat me like a monster, and it must be worse than disgusting men violating someone's whole internal sense of self and autonomy and removing them from their body psychologically on a systemic and intimate level\"\n\nThat one comment screams removed from reality.\n\nBasically, be empathetic and educate yourself on issues that don't affect you so you can have more in-depth, colorful conversations. Not as a bargaining chip. As a way to understand. You think about yourself way too much. Have fun. Let go. Make silly jokes. Embarrass yourself. LEARN.\n\nSorry if some of this comes off as rude. Idk how else to put it rn.\n\n\n(Identifying with being a piece of shit removes you from the responsibility of your individual actions btw. You're not a piece of shit. Good people do bad things, stupid things, even violating things. We're all part of a society built to destroy our humanity. You are NOT alone.)\n\nTip: You don't have to tell anyone your sexual status unless you plan to have sex with them, but in case you do, \"I haven't had sex yet, but it just kinds turned out that way. I value a deep connection and was busy with school, work, and personal issues for a long time. Now that I'm free, maybe it'll happen one day.\"  Most the time the chiller you are is the chiller they'll be. Also immediately get rid of people who violate your own boundaries and make fun of it. Good people just don't care that much.\n\nHallelujah, hope it helps.",

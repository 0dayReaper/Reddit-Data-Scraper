Apart from it get busy with work and focus on it. Then you will be over this phase.  You may not feel like doing this at all. But there's a very good line which I like\nLife is not easy. Don't try to make it that way.\nLife isn't fair, it isn't now and won't ever be. Do not fall in the trap. The entitlement trap of feeling like you re a victim you're not!  Get over and get on with it. And most things are more rewarding when you break the sweat to get it.",

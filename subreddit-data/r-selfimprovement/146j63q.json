I have a few ideas like, buying myself stuff I want, taking care of myself, but what else can I do? I want to fully love myself before I get into a relationship again so advice is needed. Please and Thank you.",

Or getting expensive brag items like a fancy car or Gucci bags? I'll doubt you'll earn your own respect with that.\n\nDo things that will win your own respect. Get in shape, go train for and run a marathon. Do volunteering helping others. Learn a new skill and practice it. Stand up for yourself against the toxic people in your life.\n\nIf you earn your own self respect, it will be a lot easier to love yourelf.",

But this question comes up a lot and I just want to point out that Jesus said if you only do two things you would fulfill everything you need. Love God and Love Each Other. Notice that it was never mentioned to love yourself. Loving yourself is actually the cause of tremendous pain and suffering because yourself can\u2019t possibly give everything that yourself needs. \n\nSomething to take note of. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

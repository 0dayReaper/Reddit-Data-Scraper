    "postText": "I\u2019m currently a college student with an internship starting next week. My goal is to get a return offer and I know that requires networking and getting along with my supervisors. Unfortunately I have social anxiety and have no idea how to approach people. \n\nCurrently I work on campus and my manager is a sweet lady. However I have rarely initiated a conversation with her because I find it awkward to approach her desk and randomly ask how her day is going. I feel that it would be disrespectful of her time as we are not on equal grounds nor do we have a close relationship. \n\nI\u2019ve seen how simply chatting up coworkers who have been around longer can significantly increase one\u2019s knowledge of the workspace/promotion rate. I really want to get a return offer and am wondering what advice people have and how manager\u2019s feel about having a random intern approaching them. How do I make conversation and what should I say? Thanks in advance.",

When you encounter problems, do you try solving them or drowning in them?*\n\nDearest readers,\n\nI just want to ask, how is everyone? I have been away for the past three months from everyone mentally and emotionally as I have been burnt out. The feeling of being done with being done and being tired of being tired made me lose motivation in anything. I lost all emotional contact with everyone, as I tried to focus on myself first. I was there, but I was also not there. Do you get what I mean? I detached myself from them mentally, but I was with them physically.\n\nIn the last three months, I preferred staying in my comfort place, my home. However, I went out occasionally for school and when my friends wanted to hang out.  Now, many of you might wonder. How did my friends take it? Long story short, they took it horribly. I was told that I wasn't minding them; I didn't think of them as friends; nor did I talk to them basically. My family, on the other hand, thought I was the same me. I don't know what to tell you though. In the process of isolating myself, I began to feel better. I reflected and succumbed to solace. I was a person who prefers solitude and quietness for peace.\n\n**What is burnout?**\n\nThere is no exact definition for burnout, but according to Robinson et al. (n.d.), burnout is a condition of mental, physical, and emotional exhaustion brought on by prolonged and excessive stress. It occurs when you feel overloaded, emotionally depleted, and incapable of meeting incessant demands. It is known that the number of people who feel burnout is rising. According to Smith (2023), burnout was reported by over half (48%) of those aged 18 to 29, compared with just 40% of their peers aged 30 and older. Furthermore, women (46%) reported higher levels of burnout than males (37%), who reported lower levels. The definite reasons for burnout are still unclear, but one thing is for sure. Stress is one of those factors that affect our mental health.\n\nDefining the feeling of burnout is difficult. Once you feel it, it's hard getting out of that rabbit hole. The exhaustion and numbness just keep cycling like a sphere. The once shiny wheels are now rusted from overworking and overburdening. I am sure when you don't know the feeling of burnout, you might think it is the slightest piece of pain. However, for those that feel it, I want to say you can soon feel the emotions that were once numb. I am proud of those who overcame in and I am proud of those who are in the process and will start the process.\n\n**How did I recover from burnout?**\n\nThe first step in my recovery was acknowledging the fact that only I can change how my future is going to go. Now, it's not easy. It wasn't easy even thinking about it. Every time I think about it, an immense burden falls on me. It made me feel even more depressed than I already was. I took my time experiencing solace, and when the time was right, I decided to make the change. Occasionally, we need a break, right? We all need to sit down after standing up for so long. With the lemons we got, we make lemonades! We drink that refresher. If you drank the tequila and drown in them, we have to get back up again. We have to sober up and start making baby steps.\n\n**What are the symptoms?**\n\nBurnout doesn't show itself in one full attack. Once it's in you, it goes slow and steady. You will eventually feel it once it's overflowing. A lot don't notice how worse they are once they admit it to themselves. You feel sad, exhausted, numb, and empty. I became confused with how I was feeling when I felt this. As a high achiever growing up, academic validation became embedded in me. This developed my burnout. However, it may be different for other people. They may get burned out from work, family, or friends. It is a struggle knowing it and straying far away from it.\n\n**Why did I write this?**\n\nI wanted to try and open the minds of those who are still unaware of burnout. Others might think it's simply sadness. However, we are all in no position to tell how a person is feeling. Keep in mind to not invalidate others! Why did I feel burnout? I also do not know. The main takeaway is it's okay to feel what you feel. We can all take a break, once in a while. There is a chance you might treat it better than what I did, which is staying in solitude until I feel ready again. We all have different experiences, and I hope this works out for you.",

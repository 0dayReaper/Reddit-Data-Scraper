    "postText": "Not sure if my experience is this completely but I am curious and would love any possible advice. Split Personality is - A disorder characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states. Dissociative identity disorder, previously called multiple personality disorder, is usually a reaction to trauma as a way to help a person avoid bad memories - according to google.\n\n\nI experience this with relationships. It's more due to trust. Quick back story, I was in a long time relationship when I found out my gf had been lying to me for months about so many different things. It got to the point where any little thing she would tell me, like that she was home doing homework, I wouldn't believe it. Idk if this is tmi but she even sent me an explicit image on Snapchat and I literally freaked out because I didn't think it was meant to go to me.\n\nFast forward about 7 years, I thought I was passed all of this and I am finding myself doing the exact same thing in my current relationship (new gf.) I did catch her in a lie about a party, she told me the following day, and long story short I can't find myself to believe a single word she says. I play through hundreds of scenarios in my head and half of my brain (I call this the logical side) tells me to stop making up scenarios, and the other half of my brain (my illogical side) believes these made up stories 100%. Easy example, she tells me she goes out to get coffee with a girlfriend, and I think of her getting coffee with some random guy. This feeling comes and goes but is extremely hard to deal with when it's in full go.\n\nThis is all summed up, there are many more parts of the story, but essentially when I catch someone in a lie, even if it's not extremely serious, I lose all trust and question everything and it legitimately makes me sick to my stomach. Curious if anyone else deals with this or advice on how to help. Thanks!",

    "postText": "Hello people !\n\nI'm 26 yo guy and I have an issue... It's getting so bad that I have issues with my girlfriend because of it.\n\nHere is the thing, I have this one friend that I really adore, but he is also the root of my mental issues lately ( unintentionally ) .\n\nThis guy and me are opposites. I am extremely ambitious, he would rather sit home, watch porn, and pity himself for failing uni, being a virgin , and shit like that.\n\nFor years I've tried to help him. I called him out on his porn addiction. I've tried to tutor him in math, and other 6 subjects he was failing.  And guess what, I just ended up feeling guilty . Why ? Because he obviously likes his lifestyle the way it is. I don't know why I feel sorry for him, and try to help him every time risking my own mental health.\n\nThis made me develop something similar to anger issues, but it's only directed at him. I get mad over everything this guy does , and he always does some stupid shit . He is always late, never listens to what people say to him. You could literally tell him the most important thing in the world and he will just be like OK, and when you mention it the next day he would be like wtf you talking about , you never told me about this. No he doesn't have ADHD. I made him go to multiple psychiatrists , to help with his porn addiction . All of them are 100% positive he doesn't have it, or any mental illness for that matter. The I made him go part might make some of you uneasy, but I just love that guy so much people. He is a really good friend. I really don't want to see him suffer so much, because of such a stupid shit like porn. And I don't want to hurt him, but my anger towards him is getting out of control. Even those psychiatrists said that it's all because he started watching porn at like 11.\n\nHe is also making me anxious , because I'm scared that I will hurt him.  I recently showered him with insults of every kind. After I said everything I did, I had a panic attack for the first time in my life... But when he makes some sexual remarks about every female character in movies or anime, or worse about random girls from uni, I just get so mad . I was raised by 3 ladies , call me gay or whatever you want . I fucking hate it . I hate any kind of sexual content . I hate forced sex scenes in the movies, I hate pornography and went for 26 years without ever looking it up voluntarily. Ofc, this guy, my friend used to show me that damned rule 34 and ruin the movies , anime , games and characters for me.  I would just call him pathetic and tell him to seek therapy .\n\nBut turns out I am the one who needs therapy now. I have panic attacks every day. My girlfriend can't handle seeing me like this and she is really worried. And on top of all that my other friends want to ditch this one, and that makes me feel like shit . I am aware that I am the one who is toxic to my friend, and I am really ready to better myself , no matter what it takes . It's just that I don't know how. How do I just stop worrying about him , and trying to help him , and instead just help myself ?\n\nEdit : Forgot to mention the most important part. He is the one always reaching out to me when he needs something, or feels bad. He writes walls of texts when he feels bad, and ignores whole friend group when he feels good. ",

Most wholesome bunch of people one could meet. Eats me inside when I have to look his mom in the eyes knowing that he dropped out, while she thinks that he is doing good at uni, and sends him money so he doesn't have to bother with work. I will also try going to the therapist. This is all really hard, because I've known him since we were teens.",

The sooner you realise that maybe you two aren't the same people than you were x amount of years ago, the sooner you will be able to let go and live your live.\nI also want to mention that no matter what happens, you are not responsible for anyone's happiness except your own. I wish you and your buddy the best of luck on the journey of life, no matter which way it takes you.",

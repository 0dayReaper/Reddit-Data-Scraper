But all 3 \"yous\" are still just you, singular-- the point is to strive to be the person *today* that 8-year-old you believed you could be, and 80-year-old you will have fond memories and pride of. \n\nI tell younger people a version of this all the time with regard to investing for their retirement--they have trouble envisioning themselves as old and living a certain lifestyle 60 years from now --when you know what that $ could do for your life right now. But 80 year old you is NO DIFFERENT than the person you are today. He/she is not some nebulous concept existing only  in the distant future, they're YOU, almost exactly as you exist today, with the same dreams, desires. fears and things that make them happy.  And that 80-year-old will be really pissed at you/themselves when they don't have the money to live like they'd like to when it would have been *so easy* to just put a *little bit* away each week, now.\n\nAs far as doing it to please friends and family and peers, that's a motivator you'll lose too quickly.  Looking for praise and approval from others will never work out like you hope in the end.  People who care about you will support you whatever you do. If they don't,  maybe it's not worth your time improving their opinion of you.",

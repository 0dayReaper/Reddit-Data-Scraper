    "postText": "I don't even know how to start, I just know I've been like this ever since I was born:\n\nI am that person who will trip in the same place, the same way, every single day. Finding random bruises that I cannot explain why in my body is just normal. I  hit the chairs in my house every single day, just like I hit my room's door.\n\nI will bite my cheeks at least once a month.\n\nI will spill my food on the table when eating, and when Im serving my plate, I WILL SPILL IT ON THE STOVE, EVERY SINGLE TIME.\n\nI will spill juice or whatever Im drinking on my shirt SPECIALLY IF ITS WHITE, at least 4x a week. \n\nIm good at realistic drawing (really good) BUT I CANT DRAW A STRAIGHT LINE FOR MY LIFE, NOR CAN I USE A RULER OR SCISSORS PROPERLY\n\nAt least twice a year I will hit a random pillar with my car out of plain uncoordination/imprudence\n\nI'm at med school and is just plain normal for me to do some random dumb shit like TRYING TO ANESTHETIZE a patient with a SUCTION NEEDLE\n\nIf im trying to explain something med related to a med friend, I will say something really wrong out of simply dumbness/clumsiness and gotta re explain cause I explained it wrong\n\nSome days I just can't properly function, its like I went retarded, specially if I experienced something awkward or someone made fun of me, my thoughts wont work, they go random, and I cant talk like a normal person\n\nFinally, my diction is shit, Im not a stutter, but I gotta redo my phrases at least 2 out of 10 times cause my diction went 2yo\n\nI stop myself from talking much cause the more I talk, the less sense I make. My thoughts won't make sense, just as my phrases and my diction will go even more bananas\n\nI really wanted to be a surgeon, but I gave up cause I'm a coordination idiot.\n\nInb4: I workout 5x a day (1.73, 80kg, 12%BF), I sleep from 9Pm to 5am, Ive never flunked school nor got a bad grade in med school (4.45 GPA), but still.\n\nIm good at working out, but sometimes I will drop the weights or BREAK MY PHONE. Just as I was a good soccer player, but I would FALL OVER NOTHING, JUST PLAIN TRIP ALONE AND FALL LIKE AN IDIOT\n\nI'm not even going to mention my aim.......",

            "comment": "It\u2019s an odd thing. When I was younger I kind of intuited that I might be a bit less coordinated or a bit clumsy. \n\nAs a young person what I did was I said to myself \u201cwell since you might be clumsy it\u2019s probably unsafe to do things too quickly because I might make a mistake and get myself hurt\u201d.\n\nSo I have actually trained myself in most things to slow down and do everything with full deliberation and focus. \n\nI don\u2019t anymore consider myself to be clumsy. But I would say I think I had the right approach. Make doing things correctly a habit by doing them slowly and deliberately. Break down the process of the things you do no matter how simple it might seem. \n\nAvoid jolting yourself or your limbs. Move them. Like a person who feels an itch in their eye might jolt their hand to scratch the itch. I instead slowly bring my hand up and deliberately and carefully scratch the affected area.\n\nSo my recommendation is avoid sudden movement and think through the physics of what you\u2019re about to do before you do it. \n\nAlso don\u2019t identify as a coordination idiot. You\u2019re not. You simply haven\u2019t taken the steps that will result in the reality you want to bring about. Slow yourself down, avoid sudden or bombastic movements, and think through what you\u2019re going to do step by step before you do it.",

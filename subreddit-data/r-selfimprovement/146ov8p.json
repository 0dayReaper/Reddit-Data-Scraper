I had built good habits and became very productive everyday.\nHowever the pressure I was putting on myself started stopping me from keep going. Since then I have had hard time focusing on what needs to be done and I don\u2019t know how to get up from this situation.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

            "comment": "When you're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to stay motivated, it can be helpful to break tasks down into smaller, manageable steps. Set realistic goals for yourself and celebrate each small victory along the way. Remember to take breaks and practice self-care to recharge your energy.\r In terms of accountability, you might want to check out the Forfeit app. It's a cool tool where you set tasks for yourself and if you don't complete them, you lose a bit of money. It adds an extra incentive to stay on track and can help you build consistency.\r Also, consider finding a support system or an accountability partner who can cheer you on and hold you accountable. Sharing your goals and progress with someone can provide extra motivation and encouragement.",

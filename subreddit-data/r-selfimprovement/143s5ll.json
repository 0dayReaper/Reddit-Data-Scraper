    "postText": "So, I\u2019ve been trying to improve my life for a little over eight months now.  \nYes, I know sounds silly, \u201cyou\u2019re 21 years old and have only tried to improve for eight months?!?\u201c  \nYep. You don\u2019t get much done when you just drink all day, feeling sorry for yourself, blaming the world, and never wanting to make a change.  \nAnyways, over these eight months I have realized something powerful. I attribute all of my successes to it.  \nIt\u2019s starting small. I know, clich\u00e9 right? There\u2019s a reason why though.  \nIt\u2019s the repetitive process that wires things into our subconscious brain.  \nIf you had to first learn to tie your shoes, in 8 hours as a kid, you probably wouldn\u2019t have learned.   \nWhy?   \nSimple, you would have had way more emotions cloud your learning, you would\u2019ve been frustrated, angry, confused, and felt stupid.  \nBut since you\u2019ve learned over days, with repetitive  process, it\u2019s second nature!  \nAnother example, learning to drive. Daunting, I know.  \nAnyways, again, imagine you had to learn to drive within eight hours of one day. You wouldn\u2019t be able to.  \n You\u2019d feel anxious, frustrated, confused, and honestly maybe even a little scared.  \nNo matter what you do in life, it\u2019s important to start small and do the things,  \nyou think are below you  \nWant to start reading? Start with ten minutes a day, no more, no less.  \nThen gradually build.   \nThe strongest part of everything, is the foundation, to rush through the process of building yours.",

Even though you weren't, and I'll call it, you got up off your ass, and you got better. That's all that matters.\n\nThat was your crutch for some months, something woke you up, and that is a great thing.\n\nYou should be proud of yourself, but you can't say alcoholic and then say I'm a former alcoholic. You can't mix the two.\n\nYou went on a downhill slope, never entered recovery, were never diagnosed, and just cut it off like that.\n\n It just doesn't happen like that.\n\nBut still, many months of drinking your sorrows, still at your age, takes a ton of courage, and give you credit for that.\n\n If  you're not drinking now, consider yourself super intense; remember that situation whenever you feel down, knowing you can get up.\n\n\nAgain people can keep downloading this it's because people do not like hearing the truth, this time even though he labeled himself incorrectly he still found the truth which was he had a problem.\n\nAnd he got up with the canvas and is now back on his feet.\n\nWhat's detrimental to people who do have pure alcoholism or a drug addict or severe depression or severe PTSD.\n\nThese are life-altering diseases that sometimes people never come back from.\n\nTakes a ton of treatment, again anyone was reading this you can vote it down if you wish.\n\nThat will be your own downfall, if the situation happens that makes you depressed that is natural that's called grieving.\n\n If you know clinical depression you know it's not just grieving you don't know why it's there.\n\nSame thing with PTSD people throw that around, like you could just get over it, trauma does not leave that easily.\n\nIt's disingenuous to people who are truly suffering.\n\nThat doesn't diminish what anyone here suffering from but don't put a label unless you want that label this stick, you can't on Stick the label when you pick and choose.",

So this is a preface that I have no goddamn idea of what I'm talking about.\n\nBut if I *were* an alcoholic, I would have so much resentment towards the idea that it's a part of my identity. This notion that it's a black spot that once gained, can never be removed regardless of your actions for the rest of your life. That no matter what, you can never remove the label of \"alcoholic.\" That whole notion just pisses me off and it doesn't even apply to me.\n\nI understand the point is to motivate people to take responsibility and to learn that healing is a constant battle and requires vigilance. And I'm sure that it works, otherwise they wouldn't do it. But for me, in a hypothetical scenario where I was an addict, that whole idea would only discourage me from working towards recovery. If there's no end goal, if there's no way to \"fix\" myself, then why would I bother. The whole point of \"recovery\" is that you eventually *recover.* I would be so goddamn spiteful if people told me I could never stop being an alcoholic.",

                            "comment": "I am an alcoholic, and my perception changed as I understood recovery. At this point it is a part of my identity and almost a point of pride. I was an alcoholic during all of the worst times in my life, and today I am an alcoholic with all of my accomplishments. I learned a lot about discipline, responsibility, empathy, humility and relationships because of my addiction. I wouldn't be who I am today without being an addict. Any sense of shame associated with the term is just a lack of normalizing the idea of recovery. Anonymity means I see a lot of people in recovery in my day to day life that no one else would see as an addict, because the idea of an addict is this window in time. So after I was fun at every party before I was called an addict (but certainly was) and before I got my life together and I continue to be an addict. That shitty stretch in the middle when you couldn't rely on me, trust me, wouldn't want to be near me that's what we've decided an addict is, but it's everything around then too. Me being an addict has helped me engage in my community and come out of my shell, my addiction isolated me and kept my worst character traits at the forefront. I make a decision every day to avoid the addiction, but I'm not trying to dodge being an addict. I'm learning to live with it, and I'm better for it. And anonymity let's what I see as a badge of honor be worn by me, and if you find yourself here someday, and still consider it a black spot, you don't have to advertise it, mention it, or feel shame about it.",

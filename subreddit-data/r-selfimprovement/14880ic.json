    "postText": "I don\u2019t really know how to put this feeling into words but i\u2019ll do my best. About two years ago it started. When I hung normally with people that I was comfortable with, i suddenly became super uncomfortable. I over analyzed every movement i made and thought that every move i made was wrong and weird and that they were all judging me. After about two months of intensity, it bettered, but over the next year it slowly became more tolerable to me and slowly grew. I got used to feeling this way and kind of just accepted it for what it was. I even got better at not showing that when I was around people, but in the back of my mind the whole time i was worried they would know that i\u2019m so uncomfortable right now. Eventually conversations just turned into me trying to impress people and me trying to show people how smart i think i am. and doing that is wrong because doing that is egotistical and narcasastical. Eventually I moved out and moved away from everyone. I have no friends, i don\u2019t talk to my old friends, they never reach out to me. It\u2019s been over a year and a half now since i moved and i\u2019m so used to this feeling it\u2019s has a could of misery all around it. I have this brain fog i can\u2019t seem to get rid of. I\u2019m numb to everything, social interaction completely drains me. I can never seem to slow down my thinking, i\u2019m mean to myself and so used to thinking in a negative context that it\u2019s all i can think. I judge myself, i judge other people, i look for weird things that people do. I look for mistakes people make probably so i can feel better about myself. I do everything so wrong, and anything i can do i feel like i don\u2019t even put all my effort into it even tho i tried. I love the world and love nature and love animals but i can\u2019t stand people. Sometimes i feel like i\u2019m not human. I feel like my mind is always thinking so much and taking in so much information that it\u2019s driving me crazy. I always feel tired no matter how good i sleep i feel like it\u2019s never enough. I get random casual suicidal thoughts that are terrible, like just randomly shooting myself in the head at work. I cant describe any emotion al i ever feel is overwhelmed or burnt out. I\u2019m so harsh to myself and i act so kind to people but i secretly judge them. I question everything i try to figure out the why and the how in everything. I work out and i eat good and i journal and i\u2019m always trying to do better,but i always feel the same and nothing helps me. \n\nI tell myself it could be depression but then i just accept that it is and shove the idea of therapy down the drain because i don\u2019t have the balls or the motivation to talk to someone. I feel like i\u2019m over dramatic and that i have a good life was raised good and i have nice things. People\u2019s life\u2019s are worse i need to be more grateful right? I think that way all the time but nothing even that helps mend the pain. I feel like i\u2019m a chore to be around and that killing myself would be selfish. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is the wrong or right place to put this but i just needed to put it somewhere. I just want to feel good again.",

    "postText": "Pornography, Hollywood, and other forms of media have deluded men into false perceptions of women think and how attraction works.\n\nPorn is a falsified, artificially constructed representation of human sexuality, where attraction and arousal are instantaneous, easy and abundant without true effort.\n\nOn the other side, mainstream movies, i.e. romance porn, often portray unquestioned dedication as the ultimate way to woman\u2019s heart. Unremarkable, piddling men will win a beautiful woman over through some grand act of devotion, reinforcing that idea that men can be mediocre and still attract beautiful women solely through sacrifice.\n\nLogically, we understand that movies and porn are fictional, but without experience or baseline knowledge, these misrepresentations become reality if reinforced early on.\n\nThese contradictory messages that women are owed to us (porn) and that they must be earned (mainstream media) have fucked up many men\u2019s expectations and ability to handle rejection.\n\nMen who are inundated in this mindset and who have experienced a series of rejections from women, begin to view women as a monolithic group that have rejected them in totality, who are looking down them from a pedestal. Rather than understanding that romantic/sexual rejection is something that happens frequently and is not a source of shame.\n\nRed pillers, incels, and PUAs, are born out this. They blame women for being superficial or unattainable, they use band aids and tactics, rather than taking complete accountability an working to become an inherently attractive, interesting person. Even PUAs who achieve superficial success crumble when they encounter rejection, because their identity is largely predicated on acceptance from women.\n\nOur society worships at the altar of the Victim. It\u2019s difficult to take complete ownership of your faults and failures, I certainly struggle with taking ownership at times.\n\nThis is not a pro-feminist post. This concept applies to both men and women. You and I completely responsible for our successes and failures, not anyone else.\n\nWomen are not owed to you, the same way your attraction owed to anyone else. Women did not have a secret global meeting and deem you unworthy. Everyone experiences rejection\u2014those who imply that they don\u2019t experience it are delusional or liars.\n\nYou are not victim. Your attractiveness or any other facet of your personality is not static. Your success solely depends on personal accountability and willingness to experience discomfort in order to grow.\n\nEdit: \u2018Fault\u2019 should be replaced with \u2018Responsibility\u2019, but the same concept applies\n\nEdit 2: This post got me permanently banned from the social skills sub \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \ud83e\udd42",

It's okay if she's pretty, it doesn't mean i instantly have to fall for her( nor should i later). And most of all i've been working on myself aswell (sleeping longer and eating a bit better, drinking a lot more water and getting daily exercises aswell) and i feel so much better. Like it feels so great to talk to a woman and not instantly having the thought of OMGSHETALKSANDSHELIKESMEOMG. To all the other men out there, it's okay dont worry so much about having a gf. Really just enjoy your time, work a bit on yourself and things'll fall into place one day!",

As a girl that is approached by the disgusting fappers that want me to send nudes, sexually roleplay with them and the whole - don't worry, I am a nice guy, I won't ever insult you, I will treat you like a queen, This feels refreshing to be heard from a man. No, disling incels doesn't mean women/girls like bad boys/bad men. Because bad boys are usually also hidden domestic abusers/emotional abusers. What many women fall into is the whole - he is confident. But guys are the same. I rarely see shy girls approached but if the girl curses like a sailor,screams like a harpy, insults you, she gets the most attention\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n. Despite being mean, boys do love bad girls but that doesn't mean they don't also love good girls (healthy ones). I sometimes make comments and get confused as to why people put me into the r/nice girls just because I said that porn addiction is wrong and unhealthy and that incels are disgusting. It happens each time I point it and all I hear is - WOMEN LIKE YOU NEVER GIVE A NICE GUY LIKE ME A CHANCE. Yeah...there is difference between nice and ''nice''. One respects boundaries, is confident, gentle, kind. The others expects sex and relationship just because you smiled at him and are polite so he thinks you're flirting and calls you a whore just because you don't go suck his dick and assumes playing video games and watching anime and hentai is a personality trait.",

Which are very important real life skills and help you navigate a shit ton of situations every day. Gaming helps with speed of thought-reaction and a lot of swearing. Not to mention that I don\u2019t know of anyone who\u2019s addicted to books but gaming addiction just like internet addiction and any addiction is a thing. There have been people who\u2019ve killed or died because of it. If you spend upwards of 6 hours a day on gaming alone, you\u2019re probably not just engrossed. But it\u2019s also a matter of social views. People who read a lot have historically been the smart people. People who play games a lot are viewed as childish lazy bums. Which in the case of addiction it eventually checks out. And when it comes to anime, there are plenty of people who begin to lose contact with reality. Think Bovarianism but in \u201cwaifu\u201d mode. Also the degree to which you become engrossed audio-visually theough anime and games is much greater or at the very least very different than when you do that with books. Gaming is more entertainment and it\u2019s made to be that way. Which is why you can withstand to spend hours doing it while reading requires a great deal more attention and counscious effort which translates to more intentional use of mental resources so it tires you out faster and you often pause to think or get lost in thought about this or that idea, you make connections, you produce new thoughts as a result. Your brain is working by itself. You need breaks to relax your eyes as well. In games there\u2019s a lot more action and a lot less of your brain doing all the work. Video games are more beneficial when it comes to team work (if it\u2019s required), socialization I guess or hands-mind coordination, things like that. At the end of the day, for now books have proven to be more useful in the long run, but everything has advantages and disadvantages.",

You passively consume your time, gain no real quantifiable improvement from participating, and ultimately have nothing to show for it other than your ranking.\n\nSome measure of entertainment in your life is acceptable, but the ratio is what matters.",

Some inspire designers, conceptual artists, develop problem solving skills, encourage interactive narratives, compelling cinematography... and others are pew pew pew, tap tap tap, waste waste waste...\n\nI know a few incredible musicians and illustrators composing/designing for video games. \n\nI\u2019m a theatre company director - and video games have been a huge influence (one of) in dreaming up characters, pushing interactive story telling etc etc.\n\nYou\u2019re right in that- its when that hobby becomes an obsession and a persons entire world. Video games obviously are more prone to this, due the cranked-to-firework-levels of escapism they provide. But it doesnt define the hobby.",

And honestly, that's fine, people are attracted to what they're attracted to, but it doesn't help these people to give them an idealized version of reality as opposed to just reality.\n\nNot trying to call you out, just illustrate the point I was trying to make with actions usually contradicting the advice.

Has professed love for you twice over the years.\n\n&gt;But no, I am simply not romantically interested in him, and will never be.\n\nThen guy #2 who you are actually attracted to.\n\n&gt;\"crushing\" on a person I barely know for months\n\n&gt;there is no chance this person and I would have a loving relationship\n\n&gt;I can't even speak openly to him - and he judges me hard\n\n&gt;the traits I love about him ... assertive; shameless; reckless; \"open\" (says what he thinks).\n\n&gt;he comes off judgmental regarding women (hence, me); and I am scared of being judged by him\n\n&gt;he's already distanced himself from me\n\n\nI think it's good to encourage romantically unsuccessful guys to be kind/authentic/striving but they also need to understand why guy #2 is the more attractive one if they actually want to improve their relationship chances.",

Guy #1 who is in love with me but whose romantics feelings I don't share hasn't been authentic and has been \"working\" to get me although I clearly said no very early. That's chasing and it doesn't work; also, it is unattractive. I didn't know that I'm basically not interesting for him unless he can be in a relationship with me. He is a classical \"nice guy\" as in the phenomenon, and there's a huge difference between genuinely authentic and kind persons and \"nice guys\" who are nice as long as they can hope for a (sexual) relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did make my own experience in \"chasing\" too, which would be guy #2, which is a crush - as opposed to \"being in love\", hence I've been posting about this here a lot to figure out what's going on. I haven't been forcing myself on him as I knew it'd lead to nothing, I have been secretly crushing (and viewing it as my own emotional issue due to how unrealistic the idea was) and trying to deal with that here, so it really doesn't have anything to do with dating, or love. (I rather meet and get to know people IRL when I'm doing my city trips)\n\nCan't even say I was \"attracted\" to him, I was idealizing him not even knowing who he is. It was all online, I don't know if he is physically attractive or not. (although, his plus was clearly that he's authentic in what he says. he never lied. guy #1 did a lot.)\n\nAlso, I come from an abusive family which (gladly I am aware of) sadly makes me feel more drawn to more abuse. But due to being aware of that I also know that this isn't what I am genuinely searching for when looking for love. I do crush for it; but I won't indulge; as I'm still in the process of healing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, to understand why guy 2 was more \"interesting\" to me: he always spoke the truth. Whether I hurt from that or not, he was reckless about it. As long as people are not being \"honest assholes\" (add insults to it) but just \\*saying the truth\\* (like you \"call me out here\" :)) it's all good. We need truths. We need them anyway, but they're extra helpful in relationships, to maintain them.",

They aren't any more entitled to attention from the man than men are to the attention of their crushes.\n\nWhat she has written isnt wrong. Doing these things will improve your chances for sure.

I would like to add that, in my opinion and experience, things turn out to be way more simple than the movies, our delusional expectations and fears make it out to be. When you spend some months or years without having had a long and strong relationship, you start to spend too much of your energy with these thoughts, but the reality is, its all about coincidence, chance, doing something outside your house, and at a basic level, simply existing. You can always focus in being the best version of yourself, but amongst billions and billions of people, you theoretically have always the chance to meet someone, no matter how unattractive you are. I could date my ex girlfriend which was a bad match for me and be like 70% happy. But I would rather be alone, invest time in the things that make me happy, move on, and maybe meet someone better for me someday. Or maybe life won\u00b4t happen that way. Maybe I\u00b4m struck by a car tomorrow and die. I don\u00b4t know. We spend too much energy with these kind of thoughts, but life happens, and we can\u00b4t predict about 99,999% of it.",

You can also choose to be industrious, funny, adventurous, develop useful skills, develop interesting hobbies, be well groomed, be caring and thoughtful, consciously improve your posture and body language. Even looks is broken down into many smaller parts: a girl might think you have great eyes and smile, even if you're short and overweight, for example. Working out is cool but a lot of us don't even care, as long as you're not so out of shape that you're unhealthy, weak, or unable to go on outings like a walking trail or museum. You have SO many options/avenues to better yourself, and someone will find the things you chose attractive.  \n\nThis also works for girls, although men typically care more about looks than women do, which I think is why men find it SO hard to believe that women would overlook their height/weight/boring features. (Also, be aware of the fact that people often prefer someone of similar attractiveness, so if you're a 5, don't be bitter that you can't get a date with a 10! )",

Or, what if I had a low IQ and was unattractive and no matter how hard I try, I just fail with women. Would that be my fault? I'm a handsome guy, doing my best, and dating is not easy for me. If it's fault we're looking for, I blame society in general. Like you stated, Hollywood, porn, and the like indoctrinate people to think like this. That being said, it is our responsibility to make changes, but there is a big difference between fault and responsibility.",

You could be handsome but if you stink, NO ONE will date you. 2. Be passionate about your hobbies. If they bring you joy, enjoy them. If you think she won't like them, then move onto a different woman. If you give up your hobbies for someone, you'll probably resent them later for it. (Unless it was an unhealthy habit) 3. You don't have to be a genius for someone to like you. If you think it's something you need to improve on, then start reading on what interests you.  4. If you can't see your own worth, then it's gonna be difficult to sell a woman on dating you. You have value. Recognize it.",

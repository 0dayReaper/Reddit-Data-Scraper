    "postText": "It seems like every major decision in my life, I would either end up making a bad choice or ruin the opportunity. Just an example I met this girl. It was going well. I screwed up she didn't like me in the end. Maybe it was our personalities or maybe I said something. I don't know\n\nRelated to the above. I regret I even tried pursuing her because I am so down as I have ever been. No confidence etc. I even gave up my MMO game for her because I don't have time to play anymore because I was pursuing her and she is so far away.\n\nI got this job opportunity. I turned it down. Suddenly I felt like I should have taken it instead of my current more high paying job. Both jobs are different in nature. Once is IT and the other is family business. Now after turning down the job, I felt like I made a bad choice. I already turned it down and no turning back now\n\nRelated to the above.  My dad was guilt tripping me in not taking the job because my brother needs help and all. He said it's still my choice but why even say my brother needs help. Clearly my brother doesn't need help as most of the work can I do can be done my employees. It's not like he is doing the dirty work. Most work are managerial work not actual work to keep the money flowing.\n\nWhen I was in college I took a job because of a girl I liked. The girl and I did not end well as I hoped. Now I was stuck in a job I didn't like\n\nI had a stupid crush on my manager and it made me stay on a work that I was about to leave. Let's just say it didn't end well too so now I resigned.\n\nI should have left my family business a long time ago but I thought it was okay for the long term. I don't like my job and I regret not pursuing my career in IT.\n\nI know most of my story is so chaotic when reading it. But I just want to know what can I do with all the regrets I have and change my perspective on it. Like is there even anything I can do ? Am I the only one who has so many regrets. I can't even think of a choice I didn't regret.\n\nO even regret not listening to some advices. Not seeing the signs not having boundaries. I regret things I do just to make some girl happy and not working out in the end.i regret making the same mistakes twice. I am sorry I am just ranting and this recent relationship that I just lost seem to have made me realize how I regret so much and overwhelming realizations about my life choices",

What a failuer right? No, not really.\nI decided that my purpose in this life is to show an example on how to recover and bounce back from failing, try to set an example for next people on what to do in these kind of situations, at least that worked for me.",

Would you have taken the IT job if your dad did not guilt trip you? If that\u2019s the case, you have to tell yourself whenever it comes to your career in the future, you need to remind yourself you are the final decision maker, so no more regrets there like last time.",

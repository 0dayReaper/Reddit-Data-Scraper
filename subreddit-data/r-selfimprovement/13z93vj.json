    "postText": "I\u2019m 26m, 27 in august, and lately I\u2019ve felt stuck in life. I\u2019m teetering on the edge of negatives for my bank account and I know If I put in the time on top of my full time job, I could do side work and easily fix that issue, but anytime I decide I should doordash, I freeze up and stay home instead. \nThe same goes to working out, I know what I need to do and the benefits of it but again, when I decide I should go, I freeze up and stay home instead. Which sucks because I really want to get into MMA.\n\nWhat are some ways I can start motivating myself to get off the couch and stop being lazy?",

Do these things, as this will fix your mindset for anything esp #3.\n3. Use 10-minute rule. Want to go to the gym or want to start something? Just try to do it for 10mins. After 10mins, ask yourself if you're done and would like to end or continue. Most likely, you will continue due to Newton's 1st Law \ud83d\ude01\n4. I recommend you read Atomic Habits by James Clear. The book will explain how to create habits, prevent procrastination, make it enjoyable, stack habits, and more. You should try and see if it will work for you. If you are not a fan of reading, just search a summary of the book on youtube. It will give you a bird's eyeview of what I want to tell you.\n\nCheers",

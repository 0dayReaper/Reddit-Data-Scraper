I don't eat, or go to the gym, or do any sport, or work, or write, or draw, or clean my room, or take care of myself, or read anymore. And it's really hard to just move. But I want to move.\n\nFor each day starting today I'll try to do one of the things in that list for at least 1 hour, maybe more. I already re-started eating almost normaly (used to be super healthy) but I have more work to do.\n\nTell me if you have some tips !\n\nI'll keep this post updated !",

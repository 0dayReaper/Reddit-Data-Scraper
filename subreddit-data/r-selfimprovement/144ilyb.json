I chose jobs following different aspects of my trauma (mainly the need to feel secure), regardless of my preferences.\n\nNow I am in therapy for quite some time and in a more or less stable and safe environment. So I want to explore myself and see what brings me joy or interest and maybe move that way. \n\nIf anyone went through it - how your life changed? Did you feel differently? What signs in yourself did you find to understand \u201cthis is it\u201d. Is it true that the activity you like brings a lot of energy and motivation? \n\nIt is hard for me to go somewhere where future seems vague for me. But I\u2019m learning :)",

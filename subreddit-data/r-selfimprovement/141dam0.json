I met one of my best friends at 34-5, about 6 years ago, the other two I met at 10 and 13, a more normal age, and I'm just as close to him than to the others, they're all almost family.\n\n You've got to spend time, quality time with them, and be vulnerable in front of them. My friend I met a few years after losing my father,  and we talked about life and meaning and death, stuff like that. When he had problems of his own, I accompanied him through some dark stuff too. \n\nHe has showed me kindness. For instance, I hired him to help me build my house a few times, and he has showed up without being payed when I had no money, stuff like that. I have done stuff like that for him too. \n\nThe thing is, you've got to screen people actively, look for people who resonate with you, it can me having similar interests or hobbies, but also being complementary is other ways. What you lack, they have, and vice versa. Not physical stuff,  but like, they can lend you energy when things are hard (like when I fell in love with the wrong person, he was there for me telling me how awful she was, what I couldn't see, but eventually came to surface). I am much more assertive than he is, and he has learned how to stand up for himself a lot since we're friends. You do stuff you'd like a friend would for you, specially what is awkward and painful, but necessary. \n\nHe parties a lot, he's very social, I don't. I'm a big nerd, he's very cool guy, he's one to have of many romantic relationships, some may call him a fu*k boy, I'm much more shy in that area. We're not the same by a long shot. He's what I would have liked to be, I have a big suspicion he feels the same way.",

            "comment": "You have to go through \"friends\" to get to bring real friends. That whole process is you screening who to let into your inner circle and it's an important step. \n\nTo build greater closeness between you and a friend, be vulnerable, be honest, encourage them and try to push them to be the healthiest, happiest version of themselves. Be willing to do things at times without reciprocation from them (but don't be taken advantage of either). And most importantly always remember you cannot control other people and some may not want to be close but are happy to still be a more casual friend.",

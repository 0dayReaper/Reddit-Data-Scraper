Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true but I can always try to defuse based on what it says in the Happiness Trap. I try to give myself positive affirmations like \u201cI\u2019m comfortable in myself\u201d or \u201cI am relaxed\u201d, even though the book said not to do that. Someone I trust said to do it. I think it\u2019s compatible, though I haven\u2019t read the book in a while. I should read the book again.\n\nWhat about you?",

When you're content there's hardly as much incentive. It's through the times of discomfort, emotional pain, anger, sadness, etc... that is the spark to the fuel that ignites the drive.",

I don't do anything interesting, i'm just consuming and don't actually know what i want. Only thing i'm actually really interested in would be travelling the world, but i have no idea how to achieve it. I'm in school, and work a couple hours a week but that's just it... Maybe i'll catch a movie once a week, but i just know living life like this is so not worth it. Because 3 years ago i was doing the same shit.",

I work out for 2-3hours daily with 1 or 2 rest days a week, I like doing it but then there are 21-22 more hours in the day, I sleep and eat like shit and still have to go to work. \nI try to watch a movie a day and try to read in my book, but the remaining hours were so killing that I resorted to alcohol and drugs, although I'm seeking professional help (appointment in 8 days). it's hard filling in the gaps of the day. \n\nSure, there are also small ups compared to these downs. I mean I'm really motivated to better myself but at times I want to give up because I'm really tired. \n\nCurrently day 42 without weed, day 2 of no alcohol, drugs and cigarettes. But boy are the days long and boring now unfortunately. \n\nBelieve me I want to improve but it's so hard dealing with all these emotions, and quite honestly I'm scared of failing yet again. All tips are welcome tho!",

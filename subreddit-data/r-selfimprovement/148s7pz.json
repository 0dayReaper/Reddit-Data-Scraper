In a way, you feel validated by your looks, and I understand why you feel the way you do because of our society that is so judgmental and cruel and can't see others for outside of their looks.\n\nMy advice to you?\n\nMake goals and become good at something. Start out with one goal at a time. Live for yourself. Don't live for others. Do things that you've always wanted to do, and accomplish many things. We only have one life to live. Why worry about our looks the entire time? Focus on becoming the best confident, strong, and successful version of yourself. You don't need to be attractive to be that type of person. Prioritize your mental and physical health (therapy, and exercising at least 150 min a week).",

I know it sounds trite, but the way we look is such a small part of who we are. That's probably not particularly helpful to you, I know, but I couldn't just scroll past your words. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79",

Looks help with initial attraction, but unless you have good character/heart those relationships are fleeting. You have many years to attract people to you who are drawn to your essence. \n\nI also agree with another comment advising you to find something to get good at. Having interesting hobbies, knowing things, and being skilled at something are all great ways to meet new people and are attractive qualities. My fella is smart, funny, and great at guitar and his career field- none of those have to do with his looks but helped draw me in : ).",

            "comment": "For one, if you\u2019re on social media then stay off of it. Stop comparing yourself to other people. Listen, I believe I\u2019m ugly but to some people, they\u2019ve felt like I\u2019m the most attractive person that they\u2019ve ever met. Everybody is ugly. Being aesthetically attractive won\u2019t make your life any better. I\u2019ve met countless women that could definitely model that had THE lowest self esteem ever. \n\nFor me personally, I\u2019ve never seen a person and judged them as being ugly. It might suck that you feel the way that you do but I guarantee that there\u2019s someone out there that would be happy to have you as their girlfriend. I\u2019m 25 &amp; I\u2019ve maybe only had 1 or 2 people actually approach me &amp; ask me for my number. If you want someone in your life then go out &amp; give your number to people. You have to talk to people if you want that. Mind that there are a lot of people that are only in relationships because of how they look, not because the person that they\u2019re with actually enjoys their company &amp; they\u2019re miserable because of it. \n\nIf you want to feel better about your self-image, then you have to make the necessary changes to feel better about yourself. Nobody is perfect but it\u2019s your life that matters the most. You\u2019re young, things will change wether you want them to or not. Why not make an effort to learn to love yourself &amp; build on the aspects of your life that you do like about yourself? Don\u2019t just give up. I\u2019ll be wishing you the best!",

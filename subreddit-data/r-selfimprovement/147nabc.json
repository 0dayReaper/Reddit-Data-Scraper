    "postText": "Whenever I search something to learn on youtube or other places for example a gym tutorial, its always just these flashy thumbnails and dudes trynna sell u something or just this and that and they get to the point eventually but a lot of the time theyre just playing this youtube game thats unneccessary and distracting. Also I struggle with picking a consistent gym workout cos theres just so much tutorials and everyone is saying something different.Not even with gym,  its similar with other topics like learning programming. I just dont know how to focus on one youtuber or one person teaching u how to do something when theres all these tutorials always in my face.\n\nI feel like if there was only one method to do something I would just stick to that and master it, but since theres always so many different ways to learn things im always overthinking if im doing the right thing or if there could be a better way. Anyone got any advice?",

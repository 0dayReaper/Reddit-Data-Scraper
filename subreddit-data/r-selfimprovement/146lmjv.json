    "postText": "Okay so my mom has always been used to have her father (my grandpa) to help her when she is in trouble. I didn\u2019t have anyone to help me because she was never capable of doing so and I grew up without a father. But that made me learn how to deal with life pretty well. The thing is that now my grandpa had passed away and my mom now has to learn to deal with life. It\u2019s hard because she\u2019s 53. She knows I won\u2019t abandon her and it\u2019s true, she is my mother, we have no other relatives. But I can\u2019t be available for her anytime and give her money every time she is in trouble. Yesterday I got a call from the housekeeper who owns the property she rents and told me she hadn\u2019t paid her rent for two months. Who had to gave her money so she wouldn\u2019t go sleep on the street? Me. And she didn\u2019t tell me anything. And this is neither the first nor the second or third time she is in debt. I want to teach her SOMEHOW how to deal with her money, how to behave, not to lie to people and be accountable for her actions. I have to teach her how to save money and that if you want to succeed in life you have to constantly improve because no one is going to give you money or help if they can\u2019t get something useful from you. And it\u2019s hard because I am not the parent in this situation. She is. I just don\u2019t know what to do\u2026. And what\u2019s the right way to do it. If she doesn\u2019t change I have to bear her all my life. I\u2019ve spoken to her many times. She knows I am not obligated to help her and I have my own life. She knows I have troubles. She told me she didn\u2019t tell me about the rent because she knew how much trouble I have. Okay but the problem is still here. I\u2019ve thought also just to buy an apartment so she can live there, and that apartment would be on my name and will be left to my children but maybe that\u2019s not the best idea idk\u2026..",

            "comment": "In the realm of human behavior, there exists a poignant adage: \"You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink.\" This sentiment speaks to the challenge of attempting to change someone, particularly when they lack the desire to change themselves. Engaging in such endeavors often yields emotional turmoil and a profound sense of personal failure for those who seek to offer help. The experience can be incredibly frustrating, especially when witnessing the individual's subsequent setbacks, and it has the potential to strain the very fabric of the relationship. Oftentimes, individuals simply long for the autonomy to chart their own course, even if a well-defined answer is presented to them\u2014a solution that could significantly enrich their lives.\n\nThe only thing you can control is how you act and react,  to reduce the pain and suffering of yourself.",

    "postText": "I'm too scared to talk about it with people in real life, but I'm turning into someone I hate and I have no idea how to better myself or how to get over it.\n\n41 days ago my ex broke up with me after a 9 year long relationship and I've quit smoking weed. In these 41 days I've been going to the gym almost daily but also turn to alcohol almost daily.I do way more drugs than I care to admit, just to fill the void. Every night I have nightmares  and  I'm crying every day, it just won't stop.\n\nIt makes me want to give up but I know that's selfish. I don't want to be this person I want to feel like myself again.\n\nI have no idea what to do or how to better myself, every bit of advice is welcome at this point!\n\nPlease, if anyone has any tips I would be very grateful.",

Start building out the plans for an even better life.\n\nContinue to take care of yourself. Cut back on the ethanol consumption if possible and keep hitting the gym.\nFocus on skills, hobbies, work, or friends that put you in a positive mindset and help better your life.\n\nIn time everything gets better and you\u2019ll start to feel like yourself again. All relationships have an expiration date. Life is long you\u2019ll find your people as you continue on this journey.\n\nWishing you the best!",

I don't have my apartment anymore, my cats are gone and I know she's living a better life while I'm in a tiny room crying my eyes out.\n\nNext month I'll be signing a new contract at work for more pay and more hours so at least the job part is going alright! I'm also trying to seek help to quit smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol, it's been a very rough couple of weeks with all the stress and the drugs help me forget about it for a little while. I know it's bad and I do want to be strong. But at the same time I keep wondering if it's even worth it?",

Life is hard at times, but things get better with the right focuses and intentions. The best way to deal with heartbreak is to use the pain to build yourself into something stronger. If you use this experience to focus on yourself and your future, your life path will get better. Years down the road you\u2019ll reflect on moments like these and be glad you didn\u2019t quit.\n\nContinue to work on minimizing your vices and leveling up. Things won\u2019t be perfect over night. Recognize your feelings and acknowledge them, but realize your feelings are not you. Emotions are just things our brains construct to interpret situations. The feeling of loneliness and tiredness will pass in time. When they do you\u2019ll be stronger for what you went through. Even all it doesn\u2019t seem like it in the wake of things this life still has a lot to offer.\n\nSome of the people who you will love the most and will love you the most you\u2019ve yet to meet yet. Don\u2019t rob yourself and them of that love by giving up. Start by loving yourself and see what blossoms from that. I believe in you and know you can do it!\n\nWhen things get better, pass it on :)",

I can love others without an issue but I absolutely have no clue how to do it to myself.\n\nMy self image is a mess and has been like that since I was a kid, my ex used to tell me daily that I was a good man and that I deserve life, and all I could think of was how she was lying and when I looked into the mirror I hated the person staring back at me.\n\nJust last night I was at a party and we were talking about how we see people and every one was complimenting me and saying how nice I am, and when they asked me how I see myself they were pretty shocked about my answer. I know it's all in my head but I just have no clue how to see myself as a normal human",

My advice is face it sooner than later. The more comfortable you are feeling sad about what has happened, the sooner you will accept it and move on. Truly accept it and move on.\n\nMy advice:\n\n1.\t\u2060Accept the break up is the right thing and it has happened\n2.\t\u2060Accept you cannot control anyone but yourself\n3.\t\u2060Realise you cannot invest your wellbeing in the perception of another person\n4.\t\u2060Learn to let go and move on (no contact)\n5.\t\u2060Trust in the future that you will be okay\n6. Social connection is a superpower in a breakup. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask people for help and try to be more social despite how you are feeling.",

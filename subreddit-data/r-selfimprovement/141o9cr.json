Most of the time we avoid solitude because maybe we are afraid of it. Start with 5 minutes and gradually increase until you are comfortable with 20 minutes of solitude.\n\n\\*Differentiate between \"who you are\" and \"who you want to be\". Make a list of who you are and who you want to be. If you honestly study the list, you will move several of the entries from the \"I AM\" list to the \"I WANT TO BE\" list.\n\n\\*Your true beliefs. It happens to all of us that some things we were deeply passionate about, take a back seat in our lives. What are the real drivers that guide your steps in life?\n\n\\*Your achievements. We often forget to acknowledge the things we have accomplished in our lives. This may be because we haven't received praise for things we thought we had accomplished, or because we want to look good to ourselves, so we opt for modesty.\n\n\\*Your passions. Here you have to go back in time, from your childhood to today, and remember each of the things that you were really passionate about, or that you did with passion.\n\nWhich one works for you or which one would you add?",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve just been sitting here, not thinking. I feel like I\u2019ve lived, learned and done everything incorrectly. This is supposed to bother me into taking action but I don\u2019t feel taking action. I do nothing and I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s enjoyable, it feels natural to me and I know it shouldn\u2019t be that way. I have a interview at the airport. It\u2019s good. I don\u2019t feel anything and I keep imagining how people would feel if they are in my position. I feel the excitement and joy from their imaginative perspective. Also I told my dad to get lost and I don\u2019t care straight to his face because he\u2019s going to the airport to drop of some family friend. I don\u2019t like my dad and my whole family . He\u2019s abusive and all the other things. I can\u2019t help but feel bad for telling him to get lost. I\u2019m scared to stand up and speak normally. To be myself and that\u2019s the thing I don\u2019t know how to be myself. I keep imagining what they would do and say. I want to be kind to people and not be like my family. Doing so is making me serve a delusion that is causing me to forget me for others. I don\u2019t like to do stuff and act in a way where I become like them even if it causes me to be a coward and not stand up for myself. Even though I\u2019m more socially open I feel lonely. I\u2019ve just made a whole personality to live by than actually have a personality. I haven\u2019t solved anything. All I\u2019ve done is sweep it under the rug and it\u2019s slowly coming out to get me. What do I do and how do I do it.",

Install habits into your daily routine that will lead you to become the person you want to be.\n\nThere is no proper way to do anything. Be a little nicer to yourself when thinking about what you are. Try not to compare your experience to others. \n\nIn terms of family, they have a different world view than you, they have different experiences that make them think the way they do, try and love them for who they are, if they are extremely toxic you can cut them out or not associate with them assuming they don\u2019t cover you financially, but at the end of the day no matter their culture or actions those will be some of the only people who want the best for you regardless of what you do in life.\n\nStart taking the monsters swept under the rug and addressing them as best as possible, again this won\u2019t fix itself overnight. This life is a marathon not a sprint. With the right mindset things get better :)\n\nWishing you the best!",

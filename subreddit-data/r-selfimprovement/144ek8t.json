    "postText": "With something called the **snowball effect**.\n\nWillpower is developed over time, therefore it takes time. You cannot just suddenly become disciplined overnight, and this is where most people go wrong. They have that mindset of \u2018I want to become disciplined therefore I am disciplined\u2019 No. That\u2019s wrong.\n\nYou gain willpower by setting yourself small and simple daily goals, for example: Getting up at 8:00 every morning and brushing your teeth could be one. And if you can complete this goal every single day, without fail then your discipline will start to grow, but sounds easier than it is.\n\nCompleting even small goals every day is hard, but that is what grows your discipline and improves your willpower.Then over time, your discipline will increase meaning you can start to add more small daily goals, which increases your discipline even more and more and more. Until eventually discipline becomes second nature to you and those huge goals that once seemed insurmountable are easy.",

    "postText": "I saw this post when trying to find an answer to an issue I was having related to my parents. This person in the post felt similar to me, like no one in her family was paying attention to her, they were always out to get her, they didn't seem to care about her anymore. And the responses made me realize that I'm possibly blowing things out of proportion in my head when I think people that love me dont like me or care about me anymore. I was also reading a book yesterday, and it listed it as one of the traits of someone who was emotionally immature. So at this point I'm wondering if I have a problem.\n\nI feel like I've forgotten how to think normally about the people around me and how they treat me. I'm always picking up on every little change in tone, words that they use, etc. And I'm always comparing how they treat me to my siblings. I want to learn how to stop overanalyzing people so much, and how to accept in my brain that people around me do love and care about me.",

To make this \u201ceasier\u201d for you, you are now asking how to just convince yourself that they love you so that you can be good and happy. The truth is this, you can be good and happy. Your happiness is not dependent on others. It is from this truth that brings happiness out of you and when happiness comes out of you, others feed it back to you. So it\u2019s the opposite of what you are asking. Be happy and good then the actions of others will come.",

    "postText": "So, I am a first year grad student, and still can't decide what I wanna pursue in my life. I wanted to do a phd abroad, and thus searched for project works and thesis like a crazy person, but finally when I got two project options near home and a masters thesis opportunity to read in the summer term, I don't know what happened, I became the most unproductive and unmotivated person in the whole world who makes bad decisions.\n\nLike first, I declined one project offer which I just \"didn't like\", the one I accepted was because the prof is very famous, but now I realize I should've accepted both. \n\nThen, I kept using my phone all day, can't focus to even read a single page before going back to either youtube, netflix or just read webtoons.I've tried settings timers for each app and all, each time I'll just delete the timer or time it longer. One week I spent 11 hours screentime every day, I reduced it to 9hours and rn it's 7 hours, but I still need to do better. I mailed that prof after 3 weeks but he just suggested a book instead of meeting in person, I think he' might be out of this if this goes on.\n\nAbout the masters thesis, I have not contacted the prof in a month, and I have only two papers to read which I obviously didn't complete, because I just can't. I don't know if anybody would even want to work with me anymore.\n\nThe workout plan I started, I just stuck with it for 3 days, just took a rest day , but it was the end of it.\n\n I've constantly been depressed after coming back home. I don't have confidence, don't have a future plan, I'll maybe graduate with no project/thesis under my name, and have no work prospect, let alone a phd prospect. \n\nThis is not the first time this happened. Everytime this kind of period cycles back into my life, and I lose so much potential and success I could have had, and let life happen. I've been the most unmotivated, complacent, want to change but cannot kind of person. Is there any way I can regain control of my life? I know I can improve, I just can't somehow.",

Focus on completing one task at a time rather than overwhelming yourself with the big picture.\r Second, find an accountability buddy or join a study group. Having someone to check in with and share progress can help keep you motivated and on track. \rLastly, consider using the Forfeit app to add some extra motivation. Set specific tasks and deadlines for yourself, and if you don't complete them, you'll lose a bit of cash. It adds a bit of pressure to stay on track and might help you overcome procrastination. Remember, it's normal to go through these cycles, but don't beat yourself up over it. Take it one step at a time and be kind to yourself!",

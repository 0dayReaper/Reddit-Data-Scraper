    "postText": "Hi, i\u2019m an incoming junior in my university. Four years ago, I noticed how I start to keep distance from my friends. I already forgot the reason (pretty sure we did not fight about something), but since then, I find it difficult to trust people and usually isolate myself. \n\nThe problem, however, is that I also applied the same distance to my college blockmates, and my study habits were greatly affected. I used to be a consistent honors student, but now I struggle with keeping up with lectures, avoiding tasks, and submitting requirements on time. I also find it really difficult to express my thoughts both in speaking and in writing, which causes me to delay on working with my requirements. \n\nI already different study techniques (pomodoro, blurting out, flashcards, taking notes, act like you\u2019re teaching to someone, etc.) but I always get distracted and end up textung a friend or watching youtube videos.\n\nI really want to be better and start working really hard now because I want to graduate with latin honors. I also want to bring back my old study habits. Although I did try applying my old study habits from high school, it did not work at all in uni. I want to change and be a better student as it will also affect my work ethics in the future. \n\nAny advices on this are greatly appreciated. Hope everyone have a good day/evening!",

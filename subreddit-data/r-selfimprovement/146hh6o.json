You need to track food intake.\n\nTrack your food intake. I've lost 80lbs in under a year. My advice 25k steps is pretty unmanageable to me imo.\n\nYou will have better results adding resistance training and dropping down to 20k steps.\n\nYou should obviously track macros. Unless you know intake, you're blind.",

    "postText": "Top of the morning folks! It's been awhile, I missed ya:)\n\nToday, I want to talk about fruit. \n\nNo, not the kind that satisfies that sweet tooth, or  the ones you begrudgingly snack on to lose that spare tire around your waistline (I feel your pain. Why eat apples when chocolate exists? )\n\nI'm talking about the kind that comes from you. Specifically, what harvest your life has produced.\n\nWhen you look at your life, what is there? Is it full of regret, failure, &amp; mediocrity? Or is it vibrant, full of fufillment &amp; purpose?\n\nMost people when they look at their life rarely has much of one or the other, it's usually both.\n\nMost people are skating through life, working their jobs, just living. Surviving. Existing. Most people aren't living for purpose.\n\nI think this is because most people don't understand what purpose is. What even is that? Destiny? Were you born for a specific reason?\n\nMeh. Probably not A specific reason, but I do have a secret that if you grab hold of it, it will change your perspective &amp; the way you live life.\n\nReady? \n\nMoney is overrated. Purpose is better.\n\nTo find your purpose, look at the thing you wanted to do first. That thing inside you that your soul thirsts for, the pull inside you that wasn't/isn't \"practical\", but you feel fufillment in? That's it. That's your purpose. \n\nEveryone has \"gifts\", \"talents\", \"abilities\", \"natural\" \"inclinations\", etc. \n\nI call these gifts, \"seeds.\" The reason they're called seeds, is because you're supposed to use that talent, or more appropriately, gift, to serve others with. \n\nWe all came here preloaded with software that tells us what we're here to do. Think of it like a divine/cosmic bloatware, but good. \n\nMost of us had a career path that we wanted to do as a kid, or have this internal leaning towards things like art, music, other forms of creativity and wanting to do good in the world. Maybe you had a business idea that you just KNEW was going to be a success. \n\nThen we grow up. \n\nWe're taught to think a certain way, do certain things, follow certain steps, and we lose our internal directory in place of society's. \n\nHuge mistake. One that leads many people to regret and unfufullment. \n\nNow, I don't know about y'all, but regret and unfulfillment are my two LEAST favorite things to feel next to a good shot in the family jewels, and it hurts almost as bad. \n\nI wouldn't want that for you, so here's how you go about creating that dope, fufilling, purpose driven life:\n\n1. Find your first love. Not romance, although that's nice too. Go back to your first dream, the real one. Figure out your gift.\n\n2. Study it, practice it, implement it. This could be quick, it could be long, but either way, it's worth it. You don't have to be perfect, but you do have to be proficient. \n\n3. Figure out a way to use that gift to serve as many people as possible. Find a problem, solve it with your gift.\n\n4. Figure out how to diversify. Spread your seeds. Not in the gross, fun way, but in the practical and intelligent way. \n\n\nThat last point is vital. \n\nThere's a saying in the church I once heard, that went: \n\n\"Any man can count the number of seeds in a fruit, but only God can know the amount of fruit in every seed.\"\n\nThat's a wise way of saying: \"You don't know the full potential of what's in you, until you implement it in service of others. When you plant one seed, you have no idea how much fruit it will bear.\"\n\nHere's how the principle of sowing seeds goes:\n\nSeed &gt; tree &gt; fruit &gt; seeds &gt; trees &gt; fruits, ad infinitum. \n\nEvery seed when planted sprouts a tree, that bears fruits, that have seeds, that grow trees,...etc. \n\nWhen you sow into the lives of others, particularly with your gift, you're planting trees whose fruits will not only feed you, but feed and sow into others. \n\nBefore you know it, you'll have a harvest that fed a generation, and it will make your life full. \n\nAll that to say, if you want to have a full life, become a gardener.",

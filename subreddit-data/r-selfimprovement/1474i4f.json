Any perceived talent I think I could monetize quickly makes me realize I\u2019m just being delusional as there are so many people better than me already and anybody who\u2019s good at something is already getting paid for it. I want to succeed in life but it feels like there\u2019s nothing I can do to make that happen.. like there\u2019s no clear path and every day seems to end so quickly and like there\u2019s no time to accomplish anything. I think of all the 10-17 year olds who have accomplished 5 life times of achievements and make more money than I ever have in my life. It\u2019s discouraging and makes me feel like it\u2019s truly over for me I\u2019m almost 30 and by this time people are winding down and enjoying their lives with their significant others and the financial security from the careers they built\u2026 where do I even go from here?\n\nEdit: if you\u2019ve shared your experience here, thank you so much. Seeing all of you having gone through this feeling / are currently going through it and pushing through is motivating. If I haven\u2019t replied to you yet, I\u2019ll try to read through them all and reply on a few days \n\nThank you, and let\u2019s focus on what we can do and where we want to be",

Imagine if you started 3 years ago or 1 year ago when maybe you first got that idea instead of giving up how much would you achieve by now already? The least you can do is start right now or you will miss even more time:) Baby steps!",

I was scared so I didn't.  When I was 20 I wished I had done it at 18 and said it was too late now.  When I was 25 I wished I had done it at 20 and said it was too late now.  Well at 30 I wish I had done it at 25, but I've finally realized it isn't too late, and about 6 months ago I rebooted my whole life and I'm *so much happier*.\n\nYou're 24.  I know at least one person who completely threw everything away and started from scratch with nothing in a new city and new career in his mid 40s.  He's so happy that he did it.\n\nYou aren't even halfway to it being \"too late\".  So get out there and do what you want to do!",

Let me be as plain as fucking day here: IF YOU SPEND YOUR DAYS REGRETTING AND FOCUSING ON THE PAST, YOU'RE COMPLETELY THROWING AWAY YOUR PRESENT.\n\nI've been able to carve out a decent living for my family, as some schmuck with only a high school diploma. But that's because I stayed committed and worked hard at the same company for 25+ years. But knowing what I know now, I could have done much more. But I always thought it was too late. I always loved carpentry but my pessimistic mindset kept me from pursuing it because \"it was too late\".\n\nIts never too late. I may never be a carpentry tradesman, but these days I am educating myself on woodworking. Maybe I'll open up an Etsy shop someday. The point is, don't waste your youth. Don't look at others' successes and shit on yourself. Use it as a driving force.\n\nI'm blessed to be where I'm at but I did indeed waste a ton of time hating myself for lost time. But all that time spent hating myself could have been used to improve myself.\n\nIf I can now chase things at the start of the dark side of my lifespan (51), you can definitely pick yourself up off the floor at your age and get after it. You got that, you young little shithead? Don't sit there feeling sorry for yourself. Make small changes. They add up.",

My partner helped me get through it by telling me to remember some of my accomplishments. I also stopped talking to people who tried to minimize me or make me feel like I wasn\u2019t capable to making it like they did. But after I stopped listening to people who were trying to keep me down and started listening to people who supported me, I was able to find the motivation to look for opportunities and now I feel like I have a life better than what I originally wanted. I also had the confidence to go after opportunities that people told me I would never get, and I got them.\n\nNot everyone is lucky to have a partner or people who support them when they hit their low points or have self doubt. But everyone has negative people or thoughts that are holding them back.. find those and cut them out. A lot of people don\u2019t want you to live your best life because then they\u2019ll feel bad about theirs by comparison. Their subtle putdowns become part of your inner voice and then you start limiting yourself. But the truth is those successful people you are comparing yourself to are not better than you. They might have had better opportunities, but you have to play the hand your dealt. If you\u2019re looking for financial security, no doubt you can find it.\n\nOne other thing I have noticed is that money goes to people with confidence. Jobs, scholarships, promotions, loans.. these are all investments. So you need to project the confidence of someone who is a good investment, and try to back it up with some history of success if possible. You need to recognize your own worth to do this.",

            "comment": "**tl;dr:**\n\nYou're probably a late-bloomer which is fantastic because these hard times now and back in your late teens/early 20s make you rock solid mentally (believe me, when you change you WILL notice!). You are also old enough to make the \"right\" decisions in life now rather than with 19-22. It's primetime for you, finally! Try to connect more with younger people (3-6 years) than you. Most people around you at your age are only happy and \"successful\" on the facade. They have a boring 9-5 job they don't like, often times they kind of settled with their S.O. even though they are not happy because they know they will not find a replacement soon because they completely lost their drive and often physical shape to attract others. You have to understand that YOUR life is starting out just now and as a late bloomer, you have the outstanding opportunity to get into the best physical and mental conditions in your entire life RIGHT NOW because you simply weren't ready back then when all the others did that journey. These rules don't apply to you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Long answer:**\n\nBeen there, done that. I promise you, life is NOT OVER and it's only the beginning! The thing is that society today is generally fucked up in terms of \"becoming an adult\" and more and more people seem to be in this stage in life earlier and earlier in life. But there are some exceptions, like us.\n\nI guess you're also a late bloomer like me. I always felt disconnected with my peers at age 16-20 and constantly asked myself what's wrong with me. Didn't really have interest in girls until age 19, was virgin until age 24, had no focus on \"becoming mature\" like all these 18 y.o. who travel and stuff. I just focused on uni. I'm 25 now and feel infinitely better than ever in my entire life and don't see any reason this will decline anytime soon.\n\nDuring covid I had depressions and mental health issues and struggled with my purpose in life. I had no drive, no passion and always wondered what holds me back from \"being normal\". I spent weeks day after day being alone outside in nature just sitting and staring at trees and thinking about life and also crying. I barely did nothing for university.\n\nThis time in life quite shaped me. I radically changed many many things and focused on myself and started to just fuck the other's opinions and started to live. I did EVERYTHING in solitude and just accepted that I'm different. Interestingly, this was the exact reason I started to attract other people, making new friends, even attracting some girls etc.\n\nI'm now 25 and I still feel that the engine of my life has just started to rev up and there's no decrease in sight. I made HUGE progress both physically and mentally. I started going to the gym, reading books and feel like infinitely more in shape than ever in my life and every day it gets even better. I also know some people from school who are in my age and are now starting to work in shitty boring 9-5 jobs I can tell at 10 seconds that they acually \"settled\" with this option rather than being enthusiastic about their job. Also, they start bullshitting stuff like \"I'm not 20 anymore, I can not do XYZ\" or \"It have been wild times back then\". Most have some s.o. and their life gets more boring every day because they don't \"need\" to make new friends, some of them have accumulated a lot of body fat and they start to completely lose their drive in life. Man, some of them even get mad and jealous at me now because they kind on inherently deep down know that this is the beginning of the end for them and they acutually want to become more like me but they can't because they are too deep down in the rabbit hole.\n\nSo I don't really connect with most of these people anymore since for me it's the opposite, \"wild times\" are just ahead and are just starting out! So what I noticed, today I connect A LOT MORE with younger guys (and also girls!) who are like 20-23 (rather than 25) because they still have this drive and excitingness in their eyes and are kind of like me. But also, I found some people at my age who are also like me and are always up to making new friends, because, of course they experience the same degradation of people at their age.\n\nYou really really should stop comparing yourself to people at your age just because they're your age. You should compare yourself to your younger version of yourself, and the moment you feel like \"on boy, I had no clue back then and lived such a boring life\" is the moment you will realize that you're actually making progress and start to succeed in life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd a note on these \"It's never too late\" comments:\n\nI generally agree that it's never too late to start out improving your life (even at age 60!). But this sentence implies that you're indeed \"later than normal\" and kind of always seems to me that \"being late should not discourage you, even though you are indeed too late\".\n\nI see it differently: It's simply YOUR time and YOU would not have had the opportunity/possibilty to start out sooner because of your circumstances/personal development. Not everybody is \"ready\" to travel the world at age 17/18/19 and exactly know what to do in life at age 16. So it's not only \"not too late\" but it's \"just the right time\" now because sooner it simply would not have been possible for this specific person. There's nothing wrong with it and the age digit doesn't matter if your personal schedule comes a bit more after most of the other's.",

What's a few years of delay, in the grand scheme of life, anyways.\n\nDon't give in to self-defeating thoughts and self-doubt.

You don't need to be amazing but you do need to be able to manage day-to-day. 2) Avoid avoiding. Figure out what's getting in the way of you taking actions and make a plan to overcome it so you can get shit done.

How are you going to take steps anyways even when that voice starts to creep up again?\n\nEdit: I looked at your post history and I'm going to add a 3) Stop going to subreddits like ForeverAlone, amiugly, etc. These communities are not healthy for you.

Your body doesn't know the difference.  \n\\- Bruce Lee  \nI've gotten into the habit of looking at the post history of people I reply to.  \nYou think and speak badly of yourself almost all the time. Sure, behavior patterns that you've been hammering into yourself for well over a decade are hard to get rid of, but as long as you think like that, you'll have a life like that.  \nOf course, this won't make your life great and everything perfect all of a sudden, but it can get better.  \nFor example, ugly is relative. The really interesting women are attracted by charm, confidence and rhetoric. Appearance helps, but self-confidence in particular can change worlds.  \nVisual things that women like are also obvious, an athletic body and grooming are important, but the body can easily be ignored when the confidence, charm and rhetoric happens. Look at the most negative example of marriage scammers, practically none of them are good looking, this is usually an obstacle for them.  \nThen you can assume what happens when a good man uses these tools.  \nI only came up with it because you write too much about it in general.  \nSuccess is and remains relative.  \nYou're the only person standing by yourself in competition.  \nCan you be better today than yesterday? Can you be better tomorrow than today?  \nComparing yourself to other people always leads to unhappiness. Either because you think you're better and can't get any further, or you think you're worse and get depressed or want to give up.  \nAnd generally only one thing applies:  \nChoose a goal!  \nMake a plan!  \nStick to the plan every day!  \nIf the goal is not met in a X week or month timeframe, revisit the goal and plan.  \nExperience has shown that the plan was bad or the goal unrealistic.  \nAnd you have as long as you have a pulse.

I am also rediscovering my love for reading books. I am GIVING UP FOREVER my negative self talk and tearing myself down. I will be on my side and being my own cheerleader every step of the way. I am great and I have so many qualities and the only thing actually stopping me is my fear and my low self-esteem. Well no more! I deserve a good life and so do you my friend. We will overcome every obstacle and succeed. We will be where we want to be. It will all work out for us. It's okay to fall down, everyone does. But we've learned and we've grown stronger. Now it is our time to shine!!!!!",

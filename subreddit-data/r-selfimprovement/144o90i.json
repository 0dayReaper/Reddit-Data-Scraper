    "postText": "I work at a warehouse making $18/hr. Idk if that's even enough to live on.\n\nI pay rent to my dad, and I save money every month. I'm trying to save enough to move out.\n\nI don't have a driver's license. I should work on that.\n\nI want to go back to college eventually, but I don't know what to do or where to go. The last time I went to college, I was forced to go to a community college and pay for it myself, also I couldn't get a job. 0/10 would not do this again. I don't want to go back unless I actually have a direction and I'm sure this is what I want.\n\nMy goal is to move out and live independently... eventually. I'm not sure when that will happen. I'll probably need to have roommates.\n\nI just don't know where to go or how to get out of this situation. What should I do?",

Not trying to knock anyone that works in a warehouse but based on your post you know it\u2019s not a long term career. Save as much as you can while you are at home. I\u2019d look into relevant certifications/licenses you can work on after work or in the morning before while you have the time.",

    "postText": "I'm starting to notice that when I'm thinking about the past or the future, I tend to only really think about the negative parts. Like a recent breakup, shameful moments of regrets.\n\nOn the other hand, I traveled a lot and experienced a lot of positive and beautiful moments. For some reason I never think back of them. Today I was mindfully looking around while on a safari and it was the first time in months that I thought back of a moment from my most recent travels. \n\nI'd like to tap into that more instead of just focusing on what I lack or what could've been.",

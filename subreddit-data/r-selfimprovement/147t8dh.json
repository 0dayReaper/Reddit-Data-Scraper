And when they look small, they look easy. And when they look easy, you do them!\n\nAnd if you do them 10% better than you normally would, you're building a calloused mind. And that's going to serve you.\n\nThe tools Goggins served up are perfect for tackling the jobs you don't want to do. And self-improvement, there's *a lot* of those jobs. \n\nGet skilled with this toolbox and there's guaranteed gold at the end of the rainbow.",

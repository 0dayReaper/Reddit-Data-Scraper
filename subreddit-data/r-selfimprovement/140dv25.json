    "postText": "I am in my early 20s and I have started noticing how I finish whatever task I start with. I am still studying and everytime I start with a topic I continue with it for sometime and once it starts getting difficult I feel this urge to switch to something else. Even if I stick through with it I end up procrastinating it and distract myself with something else and never get anything done. \n\nIt isn't just limited to academics but also life. I try to build a habit or stick to a decision but midway I always feel the urge to switch. It is ruining my life because I am now confused about everything including job fields. Any advice would be very helpful. I am sick of being this way.",

            "comment": "Is there anything you can think of that you have managed to complete?\n\nHave you ever finished cleaning your room? Did you graduate high school? Finish a class? Have you ever completed your homework? Set a goal and reached it? Are there any habits you have successfully established (they don't have to be good/productive)? I highly doubt that you NEVER finish anything you start. You started and finished this post, after all.\n\nThe reason I point this out is not to be douchey and semantic. It's because a lot of times our brain tells us that we \"are\" a certain way and looks for proof that that thought is correct. \"I never finish anything I start. Look at all these times I started something and didn't finish it,\" while effectively ignoring all of the times that you started something and finished it. It's important to realize that your brain lies to you and once you stop entertaining that thought, it gives you a lot more wiggle room to say \"okay what if I'm not actually stuck this way? What if there's nothing wrong with me? What if I can do something about it?\"\n\nThere's nothing wrong with you btw. Not wanting to do difficult things is 100000% normal. I struggle with this too, and if you're anything like me I bet you compare yourself to other people who seem to be hard workers by nature and \"don't mind\" doing difficult stuff. Well I'm here to tell you, everybody has their own difficulties. You may not see them, but something that comes easy to you might be a huge struggle for someone else. \n\nHave patience with yourself. Don't beat yourself up for having the urge to do something else. You can acknowledge that urge and decide what you're gonna do about it. For me it helps to have a notepad with me at all times so that when I have the urge to do something else I can write it down and get it out of my brain before continuing on the task I need to complete right now. Setting a timer and taking frequent breaks also helps. Doing 20 minutes or more of cardio before I sit down to do something helps a lot since I can get my fidgety energy out before focusing on the task. \n\nThat's not to say that those things have completely resolved the issue... they haven't. I still don't complete my tasks from time to time. But nothing's ever gonna be 100%. There's no \"hack\" that you can use to immediately turn your life around and live exactly the way you want to. The main thing is learning how to manage your mind, and being patient with yourself while doing it. \n\nYou don't *have* to procrastinate, you've just built a habit of doing that, but you can also make the choice to stop yourself. I know it doesn't feel like it, but you can. Again, our thoughts lie and our feelings lie. When you feel yourself procrastinate you have the power to decide not to do that. Breaking a habit is not easy, but people do it. There are people who change their life by losing 400lbs, quitting their drug/alcohol addictions, leaving long-term toxic relationships, etc. The things people can do when they put their mind to it are incredible. You are no different. It's not easy, and progress won't be linear. You're only human, after all. Can't expect yourself to be perfect at everything. Just do what you can.\n\nI recommend reading the book \"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\" by Stephen Covey. It has some incredible advice on learning to take charge of your life, and if you get the workbook that comes with it, you can participate actively in his teachings which makes them more effective. Just read one habit at a time and see if you can integrate it in your life before moving onto the next one.\n\nI hope this helped a little bit.

My brain does have a habit of being the worst critic at times but I need to work on it. I will definitely read the book you suggested. Thank you again for this! I would love to talk more about this.",

            "comment": "To finish what you start, it is important to focus on taking small, consistent actions every day, being realistic with your expectations, and concentrating on the process rather than the outcome. \r  \nAvoid taking on too much and being a perfectionist, and try to practice patience. \r  \nAnother helpful technique is to take inventory of your goals and priorities. This can involve giving your mind a name and vocalizing your thoughts when they don't serve you. \r  \nIf you're still struggling to finish what you start, seeking therapy or counseling can also be beneficial in identifying and addressing any underlying issues. \r  \nRemember to be honest and upfront in communicating your needs and limitations to others.\u263a\ufe0f",

It\u00b4s called Forfeit and you basically need to send an evidence completing the task or you lose money. So if you set it on the app for like 1 month straight, you\u00b4ll definitely stick to it",

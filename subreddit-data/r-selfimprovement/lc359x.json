You chose to see your problems as an opportunity to grow? To become a stronger person? To overcome something that most people would be afraid to even attempt to change?\n\nThe next time you're faced with a problem, convince your brain that this is a good thing!\n\n\"Woohoo! a chance to grow!\"\n\nokay, okay. I'm aware I sound like an... overly enthusiastic puppydog disconnected from reality. \n\nThe truth is, I've gone through my fair share of trauma and difficulties. That's the whole reason why I give the advice that I do.\n\nIf you want more help with your social life/confidence, reach out to me. It's my greatest passion and maybe I can help you on your journey.\n\n*dog pant my way out*",

I'm the oldest in the class. The other students are straight off courses about economy and allsorts of stuff. They're used to academic writing which I'm not. I'm NOT the best i the class. I DO stress about assignments and hand in dates. This is not a conscious choice.\n\nHere's the thing though. I struggle to write academically, they struggle to piece their assignments together with theories and models. I try to help them piece stuff together and then I try to get help from them about how to write assignments.\n\nYou're not in the projects alone, even if they are supposed to be. Other people will be struggling and really when it all boils down, people WANT to help people. Build the relationships with the best in the class and learn from them. Their perspectives are different from yours and that might help you see things in a better way. (Or a worse way which you can also reflect on in your projects)",

And you are not wrong. \n\nI think sometimes for some of us our problems can feel so overwhelming that we lose sight of this important truth. Especially when we\u2019re feeling more like we\u2019re the victims of our problems rather than the creators. \n\nWhen I get like that I find that it\u2019s helpful to actually zero in on the issues exposing them for what they truly are. I like to keep asking the question \u201cwhy\u201d (like my charming 5yo) until I feel like I can\u2019t anymore. \n\nFor example, say I\u2019ve been frustrated at work lately feeling like no one appreciates me or recognizes how hard I work. I would ask why does this bother me? \nBecause I know I work harder than some of my coworkers yet it seems they get more recognition. \nWhy does that bother me? \nBecause I don\u2019t think they deserve it. \nWhy does that bother me?...\n\nUltimately I get to the point where I\u2019m able to say to myself, \u201cI guess it\u2019s really not as big of a deal as I\u2019m making it in to\u201d. \n\nAt that point it\u2019s usually easier for me to see the \u201clesson\u201d that the problem is teaching me, making it much easier to \u201cappreciate\u201d the problem. \n\nAdditionally, it can be helpful to as yourself what the opposite of your problem would look like, giving you some suggestions for how you can go about making some improvements. \n\nOf course, sometimes there will be things that happen to you that are completely out of your control. Those are the things that can really trip us up if we allow ourselves to focus on them. Be sure to only focus on the things you have direct control over. \n\nUltimately like the OP says, problems mean were growing/learning. If the day comes that we no longer face conflict I would fear that day much more than my next problem because that would mean I\u2019ve stopped evolving and am doomed to stay exactly the same for the rest of my days...",

It always hurts to lose something or someone we cared about.\n\nI think it's just important to take the right lessons from our losses. We can choose to be grateful for the time that we DID spend together and expand our capacity to love; \n\nor we can choose to get bitter or make negative stories about ourselvs or other people.\n\nThe pain is fine, just don't let it stop you from loving yourself or the people around you.

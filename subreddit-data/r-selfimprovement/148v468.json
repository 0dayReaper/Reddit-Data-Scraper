    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m new here and I need some advice. I used to (10 years ago) be in really good shape, but not great. I could run and I was doing CrossFit consistently. I\u2019m trying to get back into fitness. I have so many goals for myself. I really want to start powerlifting again and start to do a body recomp (build muscle and lose fat), but I did just have endometriosis surgery. In the meantime, I\u2019m planning on working towards my other goal of becoming really good at running. I want to do couch to 5k, couch to 10K, couch to half marathon, and eventually run a marathon. I\u2019m working with my dietician, so my nutrition is in check. I\u2019m just wondering what your thought are about my plan? Should I stick with going from C25k to C210k to C2 half marathon, to a marathon? Or would it make more sense to split it up as C25k, take a period to focus on weight lifting, C210k, weightlifting period, C2 half marathon, weight lifting, and then marathon? I\u2019ve heard weight lifting will help with running, but I\u2019m worried about retraining my cardio too much or would taking a de training period be beneficial? I\u2019m worried that if I try to do running and weight training during the same period, the soreness from weight training will hinder my running and vice versa. What would you suggest? Has anyone run into this issue before? Thanks!",

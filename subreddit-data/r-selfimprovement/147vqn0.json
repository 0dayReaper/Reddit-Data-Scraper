    "postText": "Im 37. I was my dads carer for years. He passed away last year. Since then, everything has gone downhill. I was doing boxing daily, i was fit, i didnt have any aches nothing. Since my father passed away, i broke my arm, i got the flu many times, i got myocarditis, i sprained my neck very badly but the worse is that ive been in bed for 8 months. I am so weak that i went for pilates and i was shaking. Thats how weak my muscles have become because of depression. Ive tried applying for a different role, i hate my current one, im getting no interviews. Ive tried socialising it didnt work, i cant go to gym yet due to my injuries. Ive tried some antidepressants but guess what, they caused me dystonia. And i cant take a few of them cos of the heart issue. I am wasting away. literally. Im seeing a therapist, i actually tried many therapists. I dont know what else to do. I dont have any family or friends, so i need to start from scratch. Im really not sure what to do anymore.",

Todays goal is to sit on your bed, tommorow is stand from the bed, day after that is to dress, then take a step out the room, then go to the front door, then dress shoes, then go out of the front door and turn back in if you want, then take a step out the door, then take one step, then walk to the end of yard, then one block, etc. Go from there\n\nSo plan bigger (to get out of the house for a walk) and splice to small steps. Switch step when the old one starts to feel easy and new one is a bit challenging. If the one you are at feels overwhelmingly challening stay on that level and do that for few days before moving forward. \n\nIt sounds silly,  but you can even do every step few days once a day and still it takes only few weeks and changes so much. You dont have to even think about it, just follow the plan everyday and if you fail, cobtinue where you left off. It doesnt matter how you get it done if it does and for that small steps work. \n\nI've gotten better now but there are still times i've struggling and i get so much feeling of acconplishment when i decide to do one small thing and do it and after that give permission to go back to bed rest of the day. Sometimes i do stay in bed, but many times that thing i did with the permission to go back gives me enough energy and feeling of mercy to myself that it feels boring and unnecessary to stay (and i can always change my mind) and i feel just that i wanna do something else and im so happy when i realize that. For me its necessary to have that bed and permission as a safe haven, maybe it different for others but its good to know!",

I hope your day has been OK.\n\nYou are a badass for posting this as it shows there is still alot of fight left in you.\n\nToday just do one thing. Get a notebook and pencil and write down 3 easy to achieve goals for tomorrow. Simple ones. For example.... eat a healthy lunch... walk outside for 5 mins...  call a friend and ask how they are. \n\nTomorrow do this one task along with your goals.... grab your notebook and pencil and write down 3 medium goals you wish to achieve in the next 4 weeks. For example... Read 4 books... lose half a stone... workout atleast 4 times a week for 4 weeks. \n\nYou will find by the end of these 4 weeks you will have naturally started to dig yourself out of this hole and will be finding new goals to achieve.\n\nYou are loved.\nHave a great day.",

No problem, try some restorative yoga stretches at home. There are some youtube vids for stretching/yoga while you're in bed, give those a poke.\n\nMini trampoline is also awesome to get a good workout-- low impact, fun. Even just a light bounce gets your blood and lymph moving.\n\nPlease rule out any physical causes/issues (thyroid, low vitamin D etc)\n\nEvery little thing gets you a little closer to healing, a little stronger. I hope this doesn't overstep, but I can say with certainty that your dad would want you to enjoy life; to feel good, to learn new things, have new experiences. Every little step gets you closer.\n\nI just saw your post about getting into LSE-- congratulations! Please take care of yourself, keep getting stronger and healing. This will only improve your life, and your school experience :)",

It's the absolute right answer in the short term, but it's the absolute wrong answer in the long term.\n\nFor physical stuff, that means 2-4 days of rest but then you have to start doing things.  Otherwise you're not resting any more, you're developing a habit of doing nothing.  And that makes it doubly more difficult to get going again.\n\nIf you've got broken bones that need longer to heal that's fine, make allowances for that but don't shut down for more than a few days.\n\nIf you've got mental/emotional difficulties that make you want to crawl under the blankets and do nothing, that's OK for a few days but after that you have to force yourself to start doing things like basic self-care and housecleaning, no matter how difficult.\n\nA few days rest is a good thing.  If you go much beyond that, you rist getting into a habit of doing nothing and you'll feel like garbage even once the initial hurt has healed.\n\nThere's no easy path for you at this point.  But there's a better path and a worse path.  The better path is start doing stuff, make yourself do it and understand it's going to suck while you work things out.",

The next get up, make the bed &amp; open all your windows get some fresh air in and take it like that until you feel ok with going for a walk and make that your routine. \n\nBed should be for sleeping &amp;sex tgats it, if you want to rest/ read/ sit down for a short period, sit on the sofa, or better still a chair thats a bit uncomfortable so it forces you to get up after a while. \nIf you have a garden just sit in it listen to the aounds around you. \n\nNone of this will cure your depression  but it will help you feel a bit more awake, energetic and hopefully awake your drive to do more than you are currently.\n\nI wish you all the best, don't give up just keep taking tiny steps &amp; before you realise you will be half way up a mountain \ud83d\ude0a",

Your whole life was upended in multiple ways, be patient with yourself. \n\nI would recommend trying to find something low-energy that you can get into. Like audiobooks, podcasts, etc. It sounds like the gym and working out was a big part of your life before, and you can work up to that, but given your injuries and your current state it won\u2019t be possible to achieve the same level now as you had before. Hence the suggestion for some low-energy hobbies. Maybe you could join a book club, do some writing, or something similar. It will give your brain something to do and hopefully bring up your confidence a little bit. I am an avid reader so if you\u2019d like suggestions let me know! I mostly read fantasy but read other genres too. \n\nOverall, like many others have said: baby steps. Try to push yourself just out of your comfort zone (ie sit in a chair next to your bed for 5 minutes) and then stop that and congratulate yourself. Any progress is great progress and you should express pride and gratitude towards yourself. Take it easy and best wishes :)",

I am combating chronic depression sometime now... there's nothing new we can tell you to help you, you probably read it or heard about it already. You are unique and you will probably need something tailored made for your unique needs. Depression is like any other disease, but there's a major difference: it takes different intervals to heal. You dont wake up one day feeling super okay again, you wake up with some days better than the others at first. You say it's been a year to 8 months: that's too short! Like you can't expect to take an antidepressant and immediately start smiling or something! It takes minimum 2 weeks to a month to see a significant difference from a treatment. You don't just get on and off antidepressants either: that fucks up your brain chemistry even worse! You do it gradually. Did anyone guided you through this process?\nAlso, I don't understand why you changed so many therapists in so little time... that's not how therapy works. You need consistency. I am not telling you to keep an incompatible therapist, but it takes a few sessions to see if a therapist is appropriate to you and your needs. When I say therapist,  for such clinical and chronic of a situation as yours I strictly refer to a psychiatrist!\n\nNow the little things: be gentle with yourself. Feel no pressure to go back to your previous work out schedule, accept the changes on your body, show compassion to yourself. It's okay. If you shower today then this is a small win for you! If you did that tiny thing you were supposed to do last week then that's also a win!! Did you do 2 pieces of the huge pile of dirty dishes? That's progress, good job! I can go on, these are things that worked for me, and there are vloggers describing their struggles on social media videos that can be very helpful. Good that you opened up and you sjared your struggles, it takes a lot of energy and courage! I hope the rest of the commends will help you as well.",

Let\u2019s say I think about doing 200 push ups I have to let the words out and once they are there\u2019s no going back try different methods to things like cleaning your room is a start to something then do your living room and try to think about it for 5 mins what can I do to make this better I can guarantee you\u2019ll find something to make the wood look better in 5 mins so the same can apply to you go on a walk/jog join a gym go swim take little wins every day and you\u2019ll be better by the year",

You are who you are today. So try to be your own best friend for your future self, so he can be grateful for what you did for him. Good luck.",

It\u2019s time to tap into the non-physical non-mental, the emotional and soul: your spirituality, only faith and energetic awareness can help you recollect strength now. Be easy on you. Give yourself time to grief and when time and energy allows you, you will transform yet again.",

One very very very small thing at a time.\n\nI once read \u201cAnyone can do something for 15 minutes\u201d\n\nThat was too big for me when I had major depression, which is why I went to the doctor and got medicine.\n\nDon\u2019t try to do this alone. Go get help. \n\nIf you cannot afford help, look for free help. If there is no free help, I am sorry because I\u2019ve also been there before.\n\nIf you think about it, you CAN do something for 15 SECONDS.\n\nSet a timer on your phone for 15 seconds. See what you can do.\n\nMaybe you pick up a dirty dish and set it back down. Or perhaps you smooth the blankets on your bed or fluff your pillows.\n\nSomething.\n\nAnything.\n\n15 seconds.\n\n\nDo that and see how surprising it is that you did something! And then do it again.\n\nMaybe you need 10 seconds to start with, and that\u2019s okay, too.\n\nBuild up to 60 seconds of doing something.\n\nYou cannot beat depression in a second. Or an hour. Or a day. Or a week. Or a month.\n\nIt is a slow climb back out of depression, and it\u2019s okay! This takes time. \n\nBut the time will pass whether you work on feeling better or not.\n\nMay as well find something positive you can do for 10 seconds than just lay there.\n\nI think you can do a small something. What do you think?",

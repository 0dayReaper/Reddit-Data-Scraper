I'm 10th grade and that's a deal in India as their are boards exam and my parents want me to do very good in it and why shouldn't they expect good grade because they are providing every thing they think is required, I'm the problem myself, I don't study, Don't write anything, Isn't that approachable and their is nothing I also expect them to do instead I try my best to hide and don't talk about it as I think I can change is and their is nothing they can do in this. I procrastinate too much and is just not doing what I have to be doing in this age and time. I just use computer all day, watch youtube, movies and to satisfy my brain think that I can do it it's not that hard and leave it for next day. It's been a year or two and as time is passing I am fucking my future, my desire,my life and everything. and the most painful part is even when I go and try to study I have tons of things pile up and I fell so dumb as I didn't understand the things and not been able to complete and memories things on my predicted time then I get frustrated, angry and want to just end this mess and on top pf it my parents ask me everyday what have you studies show me copies on which you have written, do you do maths and many things. They expect much from and I want them to do but I feel like at the position I am I fell incapable. I think I will not turn out like the one I want to be. Even physically I'm not tall and I don't want to be short, I am not masculine at all instead have some good amount of fat on my stomach, butt and thigh.....................\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWHAT SHOULD I DO....................",

Do you want to be in this condition five years from now? Then act, dump all the things you already know you should not be doing. It is all up to you, not your parents. Sounds like they are a great resource for you should you choose to listen and act on their advice.\n\nIf nothing else consider dropping the foul language, right?\n\nYour mindset, health habits, and mental health need immediate attention, please contact me if you wish to take the necessary steps to change. Wishful thinking will get you nowhere.  You already know that has not been working for you.\n\n\r  \nThanks for sharing.",

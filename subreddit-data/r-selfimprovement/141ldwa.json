    "postText": "(Context) \nI have been struggling with my mental health very severely for over 12 years. It has definitely gotten better, but not enough.\n\nIn terms of my outward quality of life it has improved so much. I have found a fantastic network of friends who really do care for me and I look forward every day to going out and doing things. I have also started volunteering at a charity which I like very much, despite finding it very difficult. It's not a real job, as my family likes to remind me, but I am comfortable with the flexibility that comes with it being volunteer.\n\nFor the better part of a year I went nowhere and spoke to noone. I had zero friends and barely left the damp dirty room at my dad's house. Only leaving it bi-monthly when my dad would drag me out. \n\nNow I leave my flat at least three or four times a week, to do my volunteer shifts or to see friends or go out on the town. It has changed my life so munch having these events, meeting people and having and making friends. People willingly come up to me and tell me how much they like me. And not just friends but friends of friends and even strangers. My self love is at an all time high.\n\n(Advice)\nThe problem is that the other part of my life, the private part, has not improved much at all. I moved into a small flat of my own in 2019 and I told myself with my life being different and how much I had going for me I would never let my new flat get how bad the room in my dad's house was. The problem is is that it has. I seem to be incapable of improving in that area. I keep all of this secret from the people in my life, noone knows how bad it really is. My entire flat is caked in mold. It's very damp. I can get my landlord to fix the mold but that's only if I can maintain the state of my flat enough that I'm not going to get in trouble with my landlord over the condition of the place which I don't seem to be able to do. I just don't seem to have any fight in me. And I know a lot of people are going to see it as me being lazy or gross and maybe that's true but trust me that I don't want to live like this. My quality of life is honestly so low that I get incredibly depressed about it. It makes me so sad and sick when I lift up a pillow and it's black on one side. And not just the condition of the flat but I've also not done much to decorate at all. Half of the flat is uncarpeted still and I've just not improved it at all.\n\nFor a while I was paying a cleaner to help me maintain the place but I just can't afford it with how expensive everything is now. I couldn't schedule her often enough to actually make any real improvements.\n\nI want desperately for this aspect of my life to improve. My quality of life is honestly very, very poor and it's horrible to live through every day. I really don't know how I'm pretending outwardly that I'm a normal person to be honest.\n\nSo I guess to kinda wrap things up or ask a more specific question, do we have any services in the UK that might be able to help me? And I mean more specific than just the NHS mental health route because I have tried them several times and they have never helped me.\n\nThe two main things I'm wondering is\n\nWhat route should I take for long term either figuring out what specifically is wrong with me/helping me improve my self care?\n\nAnd in the short term how can I improve my quality of life? Are there any services that might be able to help me clean or any subsidised cleaning services for people with mental health problems?\n\nI would really appreciate any help you guys can give. Thank you.",

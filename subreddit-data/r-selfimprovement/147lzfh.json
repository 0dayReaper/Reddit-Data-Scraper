    "postText": "I used to struggle a lot with math, science, accounting etc.\nI\u2019ve worked hard for the past 2 years and improved in all my subjects to the point where I even did the best in my math class last term (My grade was 56% 2 years ago and now it\u2019s 84%) And the recent exams have been going good for me. \n\nHowever,\n\nI recently wrote the National Benchmark Test, which is a standardised test in South Africa which tests your academic and quantitative literacy as well as math skills. It\u2019s required to study medicine, which is what I applied for everywhere. \nThe problem is that the Math tests (MAT) are to be written without calculators\u2026I got 40% for the MAT. \nAfter sobbing for a good 20 minutes I\u2019m not sure what to do. They also look at your end of year grades, but I\u2019m scared that even if I get 90% in all my subjects that my NBT is going to negatively effect me.\n\nIm also scared this is going to discourage me from studying or subconsciously make me dislike studying for example",

            "comment": "You might want a result more than you want to understand. \n\nReally think about this, do you want someone who doesn\u2019t know medicine yet to be a doctor? Of course not. \n\nThis is what schools should probably teach people, failing a test is *helping you* see what you don\u2019t know so you can learn it. It\u2019s not preventing you from getting to your dream, it\u2019s showing you what you need to know to get there.",

            "comment": "I agree with the 2 other comments but on top of that I would like to say that you are beaten only when you give up, failing is part of the learning process so don't worry about it too much, fuel off of it and try harder next time and results will be better. Not sure if it will make you feel better but I played chess with my grandfather and I only got my first win after 4 years of losing about 500 games at least.",

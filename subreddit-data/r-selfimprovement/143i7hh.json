            "comment": "Being in a leadership position doesn\u2019t make you a leader. On top of that, it\u2019s really hard to gauge your own level of leaderships skills. Nobody can say they are a good leader, only others can give us that title.\n\nI\u2019d start with identifying leadership traits you want to improve. These are entirely up you, but some important ones are empathy, communication, selflessness, decisiveness. Some are attributes and some are skills. Once you\u2019ve identified the few you want to work on, look for opportunities to practice them.\n\nLet\u2019s use Decisiveness as an example. Well what is decisiveness? It is making reasonably well-informed decisions in a timely fashion. Opportunities to practice this will occur constantly throughout your day. You need to decide what to wear in the morning. You get an email at work and need to decide the best way to solve a problem. You have to decide whether to do bench press or go for a run at the gym. You can exercise decisiveness by engaging it when these moments come up and asking \u201chow can I be decisive in this moment\u201d.\n\nOthers are more relationship based like empathy, but the same concept applies. When your wife (gf, friend, whatever) comes home in tears, ask yourself \u201chow can I be more empathetic?\u201d. How can I feel what she is feeling instead of just going through the motions of consoling her?\n\nSorry that might be a bit belabored, but I hope it helps. The simple answer is that opportunities are all around you. The issue is just taking an active role in improving those skills. With luck, someone will notice you doing so, and give you a bigger opportunity to be a Leader by name.",

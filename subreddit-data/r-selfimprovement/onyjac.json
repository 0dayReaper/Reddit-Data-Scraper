The subjective meaning is something I've discussed with Rebeca about, the existential one. It's oriented toward the self where all conditions are evaluated and decisions are made centered around what constitutes the self you are dealing with. The objective meaning, instead or being centered around the self, is centered around epistemology.\n\nThis directly carries over to what a vapid life means based on what perspective you want to take. I can't tell you what a vapid life means to me because it's not applicable outside of myself. The only meaningful way to discuss these things is to examine the epistemological perspective that's independent of the individuals. Outside of the communication paradigm of the individuals, communication is as meaningless as nothing but regurgitating your own thoughts, regardless of whether those thoughts stemmed purely out of communication itself.",

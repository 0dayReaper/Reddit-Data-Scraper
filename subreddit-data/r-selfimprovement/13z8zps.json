    "postText": "I've been on a personal improvement journey and I think I'm becoming more and more aware of how problematic I use to be (and still am). I was introverted, socially avoidant, insecure, egotistical, sought external validation and self obsessed. I'm not always like that but for the most part, I can't stop thinking about myself and what I'm lacking. I've been gunning for a competitive program for years, I have a couple of close friends, and I haven't worked much at all. I have a really hard time just diving in and wholeheartedly investing in something. I really want to shift my perspective so it's more aligned with reality rather than all the filters, fears, and standards I've placed on myself. When I talk to strangers, I feel like I live in a totally different and isolated world on my own.  Please give me some advice on how to pull my head out of my ass!",

Question your assumptions and biases, being open to new ideas and perspectives.\n\n Embrace intellectual humility and recognize that your current viewpoint may be incomplete or flawed. Engage in respectful dialogue with others, considering their viewpoints and experiences. Continually learn and adapt your perspective based on new evidence and insights.",

The nice part about accountability is that it grounds us, calls us out on our BS, and gives us deadlines for getting real work done. I meet with my partner twice a week, and we review what goals we previously set, how we're doing, what might interfere with our goals and how to mitigate, reflect on any bad decisions and how to do better, and give support as well as encouragement. This stuff is really hard to do alone, and we can often be more honest with others than we can be with ourselves. Wishing you all the best!",

If you do a search for \"accountability partner Reddit\" you'll find subreddits for connecting people. Simply describing the type of accountability and frequency of check in you want is sufficient. It doesn't really matter if your partner is trying to lose weight or get into medical school or find a job, you just tell each other your goals and check in to make sure you're both working on them. Different paths don't make a difference (although sometimes it's nice to get support from someone who understands your situation, not required though).\r  \n\r  \nThe biggest advice I have is to stick with it, both for finding the right partner and for working on your goals after. A lot of people don't commit and it might take several tries to find a partner who is reliable and motivated. Once you find them, you should do your best of offer them the same. You can do this!",

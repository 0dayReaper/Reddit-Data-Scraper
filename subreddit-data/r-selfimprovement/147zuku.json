It\u2019s torn up my image of women and how I view them. No matter where, no matter when, I would instantly go to it if I had to the chance to.\nBut today is the day where I\u2019ll say no and slowly stop this addiction because it\u2019s been ruining me for these last few years.\nThis will not be easy as I have been trying to do this for the last month but today is the day where it\u2019s done,no more!",

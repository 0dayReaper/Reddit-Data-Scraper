Now I'm 21, sitting at home , waiting for college to start.\nBut, I'm seeing people on internet doing amazing things at the age of 22-23 and I feel bad about myself coz I'm doing nothing. \nLast time I was happy in 9th grade when I participated in my school dance performance.",

I never really knew how old anyone was unless specific situations happened, going out with friends and one isn\u2019t old enough to buy alcohol for instance. Some of our peer group included students who were noticeably older- one woman had children the same age as us- but it never really seemed to matter.",

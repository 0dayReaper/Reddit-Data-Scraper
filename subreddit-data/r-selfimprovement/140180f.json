    "postText": "27 yrs female here, I need your genuine help! For the past few years I've been working really hard. I have two almost full time jobs and my personal time is reduced to mostly zero. I had a relationship in which I felt I was always tired and full of stress. My  -now- ex was trying to support me and push me into doing relaxing things, like for example watch a movie or play a videogame. But it felt like a chore. We broke up for a different reason and then I was overworked, sad from the breakup and kinda depressed. \nThe problem is that when I get to have some free time, I don't have the motivation to do anything and I just lay in bed , or scroll online and time passes. I feel guilty for not doing anything, and wasting my time. At the same time, I have to force myself to do enjoyable things. For instance, I have to push myself to watch a TV series. Or I have my switch next to my bed and I don't want to play even if sometimes I make compulsive game purchases. \nAnother example. Since I work so much, I was afraid that my friends will forget me. So when we arranged to meet, I was happy but also felt an urge to cancel. Going out felt like a chore of sorts. Going at the gym -another enjoyable activity of my past self- again feels hard. I may book a class and cancel it half an hour before it starts. \nI am going to stop my second job quite soon, I have reached my goal and I'm now able to work a 9-5 and nothing else afterwards job, but even these last days that I get to come home early, I don't know how to spend my time. Not that I don't have any ideas, just that I don't have the motivation to actually enjoy any of these. On an extra note, my anxiety levels have gone up. We got a puppy and I'm constantly worried about his health. What if he swallows something? What if a deadly insect bites him? Etc. etc. \nImagine that as I'm writing this, my friends have invited me to go to the beach with them, and even if I agreed, I don't want to go, I'm bored and ready to cancel (I won't but this is my thought pattern).\n\nI wasn't like this in the past. I was outgoing, loved parties, outings with friends etc. I want my old carefree life back and finally find a balance between work and life.\n\nAny advice?",

Which explains why you don't want to do the usual things. \n\n2. Regarding relationships. You have out of touch with talking freely so long that reconnecting is hard and as it is hard you don't find it enjoyable.\n\nWhat's your view?",

I'm not sure whether I enjoy this stage to be honest, but I do have to work a lot and let's say I didn't have another choice than to do these two jobs for the time being. But now that I have finally made this choice of not continuing with the second job, I want to reflame my passion for my past hobbies. But again it feels as if I put a lot of pressure in me to do things and enjoy them. It just makes me sad. It's as if I want to do everything I want but when I get the chance I switch off...",

See how it feels.   \nWe are used to our normal routines, we don't prefer going out of comfort zones unconsciously, maybe acknowledging that and finding something that scares you and doing it would help to get rid your state of mind rn.",

Without noticing that meant that I had stopped doing most of the things I liked that did not help my career. I had become boring annoying and easily irritated. I did not like myself anymore.\n\nSo I decided to stop. I decided to focus as little as I dared to my work and just wait and do something else. Initially it was a struggle. I did not enjoy doing anything. Work was nice and fun but I wanted to do something else.\n\nAfter a few months of struggling and trying to figure out what I needed, I realized that I have to just get so bored that I my bored out self will start finding something fun to do.\n\nI do not know if this is the best way but it worked for me. I'm happy again and I have started to like myself again. It did take about a year but I'm already old and I was so deep in it that maybe it is faster for you.\n\nHope you find your way!",

I hope it gets better once you've quit your second job.\n\nI think there comes a time when you just want to do your stuff that you have to do and just chill. I can relate that for example meeting up with people can be somewhat a hassle, it takes some effort to plan where to go, to get ready on that day, and get there and back and plan all that. You don't even know if you're gonna enjoy it. But I think it's still worth it, you can plan for yourself to not stay for too long, just fit it to how you feel and your needs, so you don't unnecessarily stress yourself out too much. But at least you can leave with a feeling of \"I'm glad that I got to see you again\" (to your friends) and I'm sure your friends will feel the same.",

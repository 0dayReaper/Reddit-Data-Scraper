Yesterday was a high, I planned out my whole week to get back into the routine that I had pre-covid. (The difference is drastic enough that it is going to take me a week). \n\nProblem is I just kept going until it was midnight, which was going to make getting up at 6 very difficult for me. I pushed it back to 7, because I had the room to, and kept repeating this notion in my head: \n\nAlthough when my alarm goes off, the only thing I will want to do is to stay in this comfy bed, but it's very important to me that I succeed tomorrow(today). The guilt of failing myself hurts more than being tired. And here I am, tired as hell, but awake and ready to start my week!",

But I was settled and I was happy being settled and stable, I really don\u2019t like change. Then I just kinda fell down a dark path and ended up in a shitty mindset, smoking weed all day just to cope with life. I put up my defence and ended up getting rid of all my old \u201cfriends\u201d apart from a few who stuck by me, I found out the stuff about my girl and left her. When I left her I didn\u2019t quite know what to do with myself, I was just stuck in a place where I had no friends, no girlfriend and a shit job. So I decided, fuck it. I\u2019m not happy being settled so let\u2019s just jump right into the deep end. I left my job and moved to my dads where I\u2019m now helping him with his business. I\u2019m honestly scared as fuck, I don\u2019t like change, I was stable at home- not happy but stable but I\u2019m so fucking excited to see what happens now",

            "comment": "Humanity always had wisemen who'd point at the fleeting nature of our reality.\n\n*Life is impermanent,* to those who see it as a problem and seek to make it permanent. \n\n*Life is a flux,* to those who embrace it for what it is, out of insight and humility.\n\nSo, if this is indeed so, there are constant movements in the directions of growth and development, as well as of degeneration and loss. \n\nI've always struggled with the problem of \"improvement\", because it's not a stable thing. We're always grappling with imperfection, and walking between virtue and vice. So I felt hopeless before the fact that \"we'll never really *get there*.\"\n\nBut hey, growth doesn't have to be something excessively ambitious and egocentric. We can take joy in the process by taking it as a game and not attaching our self-worth to our achievements and failures too much.\n\nWe'll never even *stay the same*! Because we'll keep on changing, according to our habits. It's not even a matter between being fit or unfit. It's how one unfolds into optimism and enthusiasm, while the other can unfold into sickness, misery and apathy. And it goes deeper and deeper. It'll never really stop. Just an example though.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share in regards to this issue, as I too identify, and even grapple a bit, with the raised theme.",

Ironically I've been reading emotionally deep end books like Beserk,TWD,and even some books about other people's struggles. I've also took my own time to read the bible. It made me realize how meaningless this life of mine is without Christ Sacrifice. Like sure I can still enjoy earthly desires but in the end I'm still feeling empty inside and that's whenever I look up to Christ. I'm still improving myself by changing my eating habits and lifestyle. I'm also doing things outside of my comfort zone like going to the gym,reading books,watching different types of shows,and as well as enjoy the outdoors. The only sad part is that I had to cut off all my old friends to improve myself.",

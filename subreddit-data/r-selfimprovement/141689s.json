    "postText": "\nI put more effort than many people in studying as I already said. I study very analytically and logically and so many questions come up that I go beyond my scope. All these questions come up. I have to find the answers to a these questions, get my concepts cleared. And I need to find the answers to learn the topic well. What if I can't? I usually do find the answers though. But there is that excruciating mental stress. Right?  Once I fure out the snwers and proceed with the topic more questions come up. Studying to me means more questions than answers. So I study very slowly and it takes me so much more time than my friends. And I dont have that kind of time. Because the  the exams come around. So my type of studying is not fit for exams but it is fit for learning. Because I learn to get depth.\n\nThe thought that once I start studying I will overthink and be stuck in analysis paralysis. And I will have to go through so much mental stress. And so much time will be gone. And I know I wont be done by the exams so it will not even matter. Because though I have lots of depth in the topics I wont be done with the entire syllabus. So I dont see the point of studying before hand as I can study quickly befor ethe exams. I only study quickly a day or two before the exams. Rest of the times when I study I study like how I have described. So, I only study before the exams but this also causes me a lot of anxiety and oftentimes I am not done with the syllabus.\nWHAT DO I DO? PLEASE HELP ME\n\nP.s. I have OCD and anxiety",

            "comment": "If I were to put a term on it, then perfection and obsession. You need to know everything, and you are unable to stop yourself from wandering off topic. The result is a lot of irrelevant knowledge and a shallow mastery of the topic. It might help to remind yourself of what you are studying for and prioritizing based on what you are studying for. Set your priorities based on your goal, and set your unanswered questions for later. \n\nAnother thing is that you have an all or nothing mentality. That is unhealthy, and you need to stop trying to calculate a perfect plan to fully learn your syllabus. You need to start working on it and be willing to accept that it is OK to not complete the syllabus. Partial completion is not a waste of time as you will have learned something at least.",

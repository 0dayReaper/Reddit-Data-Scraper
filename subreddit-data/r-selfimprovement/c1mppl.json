It's the point on the list I've explored the least, but probably the point I'm most excited about. Here are two arguments:   \n\n\n1. Bacteria has gotten more and more attention in health discussions lately. Exposing yourself to an array of different bacteria indicates that you're less likely to become sick, your immune system gets stronger, as well as other benefits. Kids growing up with pets for intance, tend to be less allergic and less prone to disease later in life. Excessive use of hand sanitizers as well as chemical cleaning products could be doing more harm than good. I'm definetely not an expert on this, hence the vauge words. But google \"microbiome\" or \"gut bacteria\" for more accurate information. Why is this correlated with happiness? Most of us like not being sick. \n2. Avoiding getting dirty or sweaty or wet when it's raining or getting sticky hands while cooking or baking, makes one miss out on so many free oppurtunities to check other items on the list, especially the spontaneous chance to move. I have a friend who never joins in on any activities invloving physical movement to avoid getting sweaty for instance. At a park on a sunny day,he would sit on a blanket with his shoes on, while everyone else is playing soccer barefoot. Also, losing the need to always look and feel like you're ready for a business meeting leads to things like being able to truly enjoy a sudden down pour rather than having your whole day ruined. And enjoying heavy rain-- when you think about it -- checks of 2,5,6,7,10 on the extra-list at the same time.",

Some people stress out when they feel like things are \"dirty\" and wind themselves up by adding on more daily chores / tasks for themselves than are really necessary. It's important to stay clean and helpful to be decluttered as stated in Number 8 but not so much so that you're constantly stressing yourself over it.",

Because you will fail. It's not important that you punish yourself for having a cookie or skipping the gym, it's important that you say \"ok, not today but tomorrow is new\". I have a habit of just destroying myself when I find myself not sticking to plans, and found that congratulating myself when I actually DO the thing is a much more effective motivator.",

But the fact remains that when you put yourself in situations that give minor discomfort like interacting with strangers for no reason or saying yes to an activity that you want to say no to (out of habit as a homebody), then you open doors to new situations. You gain a sense of accomplishment and perhaps lessen your social anxiety just a \\*tiny\\* bit more. Or you meet someone new.\n\n9.

The body needs nourishment and protection and the soul needs understanding and experience through the physical body. Once the needs of both these parts are fulfilled then the feeling that happens is happiness.\n\nAffluence in physical needs and understanding for the soul having the answer to every why and how will lead to the state of tranquility and bliss which we can call as happiness.\n\nDefault setting of every human being is happiness and in all sorts of difficult times or losses, you will find him going back to the state of happiness.

    "postText": "Right now it\u2019s summer session at my college and I\u2019m (M19) having trouble making friends. I have three other close friends but they went home already. Id consider myself in introvert who keeps his circle small but has no problem interacting with large groups. \n\nI\u2019m living at an apartment so it\u2019s harder for me to meet people at my school. I have made good conversation with a couple dudes in class, we were joking around and got in a passionate discussion about sports. They talked about having a party or going out to the club and when they started talking about acid I hopped in and talked about my experience with it. They were surprised I was even like that, I guess I\u2019m an unassuming person? But then I told them I\u2019m sober now, and their whole attitude changed and stopped initiating conversations with me in class. I still told them I was down to attend the party because I have no problem being the sober guy who takes care of people when they are drunk. I hit up one of the boys on Instagram to ask when the party was and he responded a day later saying \u201cjust saw this\u201d despite his activity showing otherwise.\n\nI\u2019ve been focusing on self improvement this summer and focus on things like working out, forming discipline, and making money through work and investments. It\u2019s been really lonely though. The thing is I have trouble making friends in many circumstances because people assume that I\u2019m not worth hanging out with, don\u2019t do anything fun, maybe due to my body language or way I speak?  When I was younger, it was easier to make friends because drugs was the common denominator. \n\nThis has happened before, I am able to get good vibes with people and but they flake when I ask them to hang out. As time passed I saw more friend groups walking around and I\u2019ve been unable to find a consistent group of friends to go out with. Now it\u2019s just frustrating because I\u2019m eager to make friends and try to look at things positively. I feel like I\u2019m constantly having to having to seek approval from people rather than it being a platonic relationship.",

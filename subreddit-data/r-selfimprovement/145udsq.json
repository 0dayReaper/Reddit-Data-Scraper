    "postText": "I \"handled\" a situation today that kind of sucked.   \n\n\nThough ultimately the offending person was in the wrong I didn't at any point take any time to stand back and breathe, rather it was reaction to action.   \n\n\nI work in retail electronics and I was fulfilling a persons order and it was going great. We do repairs for electronics and I told him an estimate, the customer was telling me for drugs (buds) he could get his device fixed so I said okay go do that then.   \n\n\nHe didn't like that, the casual reply for some reason really made this person angry so he called me a f\\*\\*\\*ing useless c word, I put the box of goods he ordered in front of me and he said he'll slam my head against the desk.  \nAt this point I said heaps of things any person shouldn't and I am sorry for that sincerely, it was all non-threatening verbal but I was pissed and was implying he goes around and bullies people which is not a great thing to say. After that he walked of and said he'll find me on the streets .etc. (small town)  \nI got pissed off and went out to his vehicle to film him. I continued with the verbal and he drove into me twice and it kind of hurt but didn't fracture anything. \n\nBasically I did so many things wrong here. I've never responded in such a way throughout 10 years of retail and for some reason today I snapped. I have dealt with police and ultimately the only concern was my safety but I want to improve and maybe just get some advice that could help these situations.  \n\n\nI do have heavy OCD but being mindful of it allows me to interact with almost every customer in a positive way and I'm not looking to trouble but today I think I pushed some of those boundaries. Any comments and stuff might be helpful. Thank you.",

At the end of the day he started it with his attitude and you challenged it. I cant see anywhere where you have gone wrong so dont let it affect you at all. Why should you be verbally abused or threatened at work?",

            "comment": "\nYou've been pushed to a point where all of that inner anger finally came out. Working in retail and the service industry really puts a drain on you. It seems like you understand that it isn't something that's normal for you, though. That's the first step to getting to a better place.\n\nWhen I worked as a cook/server for almost 10 years, I knew it was draining me on the daily basis. I was stuck in a toxic relationship and dependent on a toxic job. After my long term toxic relationship ended, my job continued to be the catalyst for my destructive anger. I lashed out at bosses and coworkers. Which just wasn't me. It all culminated after a hard weekend and I actually ended up smashing an order screen with a grill brushed and played it off as accidentally hitting it.\n\nI knew I had to get away. I suffered and made sacrifices to get out of the service industry and change my life. It wasn't the only thing that contributed to it though. My home and personal life was a mess at that point.\n\nIt's been a little over 6 months since I switched careers and I'm in such a better metal space. It will be close to impossible to do it alone, but with good support and really analyzing yourself, you can identity what could be a good step for you. Retail has become such a toxic environment because of coworkers and customers these days, you should give yourself some praise for dealing with all of it.\n\nDon't let yourself get to a point where you don't know who you are anymore over a job or career path. Whatever you choose to do try and find someone to talk to about it and find a way to give yourself a break and a goal. I hope this is relevant and provides some use. Best of luck!",

            "comment": "Although the experience I am about to recount is nowhere near the severity of yours, I think it may help in the future if anything similar happens. I was minding my own business in the shopping mall one day minding my own business when this man who was clearly on something made some sort of bird noise. He was coming towards the direction that I was walking in and and wanted some sort of scared reaction from me. When I looked up, he shouted the words \u201cf**k off c***\u201d and other extremely offensive racial slurs. I was immediately filled with rage and wanted to film him but I had to keep my safety in mind. Ultimately, even though he was the one who was mentally unstable, fighting with someone who is objectively irrational would have only jeopardised my own safety. I just kept walking and immediately mad a mental montage of everything good that happened that day. Even the smallest things, like my coworker\u2019s compliment towards me, the weather and how sunny it was, how good my coffee was that morning. I forced myself to think of things that made that day positive no matter how small they were. What this does is replaces the terrible moments with a flood of positive ones to sort of \u201cbalance out\u201d the emotions. \n\nAnother time, I did fight back when two guys were cat-calling me while walking down the street and I told them to f*** off and one of them threw a can of coke at me. That\u2019s when I realised, you can\u2019t argue with idiots. \n\nWe all do things out of character and it happens to the best of us. The customer\u2019s goal was to simply make you react the way you did because he has nowhere else to project his own inner turmoil onto. This is unfortunately very common. Many people do this. The best thing is to realise that when someone is acting irrational and are insulting you, give them your BIGGEST smile. Trust me. I know this sounds ridiculous but when someone tries to purposely get you mad and they realise it is not working on you, it drives them crazy. Let them know that their bullshit doesn\u2019t work on you. This is going to take a lot of practice but trust me, it works. Treat them like the absolute joke that they are, watch them realise they have no impact you and see how they like it (because they won\u2019t lmao). \n\nSending you so much love, keep slaying the retail scene like the incredible human being that you are. People like the one you dealt with are the ones who are statistically more likely to end up on the streets, not you.",

    "postText": "I feel like I am in a strange period of my life, and nothing seems to be working out.\n\nWithin the past 6 months, I have been broken up with twice. The guy I was seeing for 3 months just ended things over the phone two days ago. I feel so lost. I genuinely thought this guy was the best person I ever met, and I have been crying for two days over this.\n\nI am also upset because I just signed a lease to stay at my apartment for another year. I thought this relationship with the guy would work out, but now I don't even want to stay in this area anymore. \n\nI also am unhappy in my job, and the rest of my social life. I don't have any friends here, at all. My ex-boyfriends were my friends, and now I don't have anything to look forward too. I used to get through work by looking forward to dates, but now that is gone. On my days off, all I do is sit at home.\n\nI need to make some changes, because I am so seriously unhappy. For anyone who was in a similar situation, how did you get out of it? I really am so lost right now.",

Finding jobs I truly enjoy waking up for. Eating healthy because I ENJOY feeling healthy. Making friends with people because I enjoy learning more about them in a genuine way instead of finding people to boost my ego. \n\nOnce you figure out how to be happy on your own you can share that light with others and it will attract people like moths to a flame. \n\nIn the mean time\u2026 small wins. Put goals on a white board. Your to do list. Knock things out. Cross them out. Leave them on the board so you feel like you accomplished something. Because you did.

I hope it helps you. It's okay to feel hurt, upset, and lost. Acknowledge your emotions and allow yourself to grieve the end of the relationship. Cry until no more tears come out of your eyes. \n\nTake a step back and evaluate the things that genuinely matter to you. Relationships come and go, but your own well-being and happiness should be your top priority, you\u2019re the one you will always sleep with. \n\nConsider exploring new job opportunities or engaging in activities that align with your passions and interests. Join clubs, take classes, or try online communities to meet new people who share your hobbies. Accept failure and mistakes. Connect with people that care about you.\n\nLoosing an ex is like loosing part of our identity, that\u2019s why we feel empty. This is an opportunity to focus on developing a fulfilling relationship with yourself. That love you gave him, give it to yourself. Learn to enjoy your own company, engage in self-care activities, and pursue personal growth. It will be difficult at the beginning, but the one who does nothing fails more than the one who makes mistakes. \n\nLife is unpredictable, and sometimes things don't work out as planned. Rather than resisting change, learn to embrace it. Use this period of uncertainty as a chance to discover new paths and opportunities. Remember, your life isn't defined by a lease or a failed relationship.\n\nThis is going to take time, don\u2019t put a lot of pressure on yourself. Make changes step by step, little by little. As soon as you notice, you will start to feel better. I hope this helps, you\u2019re not alone.",

It appears you want to meet new people too and make friends so find something social. Could be some art/litterature course during nights, something in training like rock climbing, maybe a sport you've practiced before or why not a choir if you are into music. Check out what there is to offer for you locally and also find something you can do for yourself. Start reading books, play an instrument, meditate, bake etc. something that only benefits you and is for you to enjoy. It's important to find something making you enjoy time spent with yourself. Then you always have that to look forward to whether or not you have a date planned or meeting up with friends. Good luck to you and be kind to yourself! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nPS. Breakups suck and they take time to get through but pro tip, when you feel like you have some energy start doing these things for yourself. It helps you get out of the lowest points cause let's face it, there are so many people to date and someone else will come along and your past relationships won't matter then. DS.",

It\u2019s good that you are aware of your unhappiness and are motivated to make a change or else you wouldn\u2019t have posted this.  That alone takes strength and humility.  So you have a win right there already.  I used to feel like my world was ending when a guy would break up with me - and I realized looking back it\u2019s because I always thought I was the fun party girl that everyone loved to be around , when in reality I was so lonely even in a room full of people.  I didn\u2019t have any self worth so I clung onto men for years because that was so much easier than looking at myself in the mirror. The pain got great enough where the vicious cycle of heartbreak , getting wasted to drown my sorrows, self sabotaging, and repeat - got old quick.  I finally learned how to truly love myself and find things that I love to do and make me feel good, such as yoga, swimming, being with my loved ones, etc.  Change your perspective. Even if it\u2019s bullshit and a lie, keep telling yourself positive things until you start believing them / because I promise you, consistency is key.  You will start believing the things you tell yourself, just like you believe all of the negative things that you are currently telling yourself.  Change small habits at work - you may realize that everything in your life isn\u2019t so bad, it\u2019s just YOU that needs changing.  I know that\u2019s harsh, but it could be true.  Instead of saying you have nothing to look forward to, tell yourself \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get off work and go swimming, or do that class at the gym that I\u2019ve always been afraid to do.\u201d  Challenge yourself.   Get out of your comfort zone. When you start feeling good in your own skin, who knows? You may realize your job isn\u2019t so bad, and you found some cool people to hang with where you live while you are out grabbing coffee or picking up takeout at your favorite restaurant.  Learn to love your solitude.  Go out to eat by yourself.  Bring a book with you.  Be proud of yourself that you are 23 and have your own apartment.  That\u2019s an achievement on its own in this economy.  Write a Gratitude list.  Write a long term goals list.  Short term goals list.  Watch YouTube videos on self improvement, meditate.  Seek abundance , love and light. This could be a turning point of your life - I find the most painful moments is where I grow the most as a person.  I set boundaries to protect my heart - I won\u2019t get close to a guy until it feels right.  Listen to your intuition.  A woman\u2019s intuition NEVER lies.  If it\u2019s telling you to run, then run.  If it feels good , roll with it.  Level up.  Know your worth.  I\u2019m telling you, when you love yourself and it shines from the inside out, the people that you are supposed to attract will come into your life effortlessly.  The best revenge you can give to your exes? Act like they don\u2019t exist and you are doing fabulous without them.  That will hurt them and their ego more than anything, trust me.  You got this.",

Or were you using them to escape something from within you?\n\nI was the opposite, I felt like I couldn\u2019t have love because of my issues. I felt boyfriends were a waste of time and they weren\u2019t for me. That\u2019s the other extreme that\u2019s just not true. \n\nCount your blessings. Look at what you do have. You have your own apartment, a lot of people well into adulthood don\u2019t even have that in this economy. You have a job. You can always see if your job offers training so you can level up at work. Or, you can network with higher-achieving women in your area and see what they do and network into a new career and a job that better suits you. Go to college if you want, and travel. \n\nExplore yourself. Make some friends. Grow. Heal. Live. Laugh.

Use the opportunity to look inside yourself and ask yourself \u201cwhat\u2019s not working\u201d and \u201cwhat you don\u2019t want to do in life\u201d, then take actions, and experimenting to start figuring out what works and what you do want to do. Good luck! ExerciseC hobbies like music, and meditation always helps me when I feel stuck!",

And I don't want to forgive you cliche advice and say things like it'll get better. But I do agree with finding hobbies you're interested in or that you've wanted to do in the past and now you have time to do those things :) hopefully, in doing so, you'll find new friends/a community!! :D\nJoin other subreddits - I'm not sure where you're from, but I know they have subreddits of different locations that you can join?? :D\n\nI hope things get better for you, and you find happiness \u2661 I'm here to chat if you need a friend~",

Relationships sometimes don\u2019t work out and you have to let it go and move on. \nFind a hobby and spend time with yourself. Try new things and make new friends (especially girl friends!) \nIf you want to stay at home at least do some things that will make you happy like cooking a new meal or watching a new movie etc.",

Don't allow negative thoughts and feelings to take up real estate in your head. Having someone, anyone to talk to helps even if it's a family member, coworker, person you trust, etc. Next, I go to the gym, and usually and bad thoughts dissipate along with a good night's rest or if it's been a long day I find going out for a drive late at night to be relaxing. As for other areas of your life that you are unsatisfied with, identify what exactly you dont like and then find out what you need to do and develop a plan to fix it. It's okay to start out with small, tackling one issue, one step at a time, and build up from there. Hope this helps!",

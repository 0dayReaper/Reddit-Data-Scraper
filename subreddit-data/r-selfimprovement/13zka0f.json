    "postText": "Hey Reddit\r  \n\r  \nI'm facing a really tough situation right now and I could use some input from others who may have gone through something similar.\r  \n\r  \nBasically, I go through phases of hyper motivation to improve my overall health. But after about a month my motivation starts to dwindle and I find myself back in my old habits seeking instant gratification and just all-around laziness. When this happens my self-worth goes out the window and I just feel like giving up on every goal I've ever had. It just feels like I make no progress and always end up back where I started or even further behind.    \r  \n\r  \nHas anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help.",

    "postText": "Today Is the last day I'll play video games and use social media platforms (instagram, facebook, messenger) I'm going dark and wont come back until a month. The sad part about this is that I already made this decision exactly a month ago from today, but because of my procrastination and laziness I have made 0, ZERO!!! Improvements into my life, infact I made it even worst over the past 30 days. My screen tome has sky rocketed to 12HOURS daily, there were multiple times I only showered once every 4 days, ate only about 1500 calories a day and most of it are from chips and ice cream, My pimples are getting worst like I literally look like I have a rice field on my face, and on top of that I've been watching NSFW content non-stop. And let me tell you I've been in this lifestyle since march of 2020, 3 whole years!!. I really dont want to disappoint my friends, they were really happy for me and even rooted for me to change. It would probably break them if they knew i made absolutely no progress for the entire month. \n\nI already made a workout routine, diet plan, goals to achieve and how to achieve them, sleeping pattern and basically a self improvements program. I'm not really a begginer on self improvement so I'm pretty confident in this program I made. On top of that I made a contingency plan whenever I try to look up NSFW content my phone automatically locks for an hour and this setting can not be removed by rebooting the phone or by simply just \"deleting\" it, to make sure I dont get tempted I changed to a browser with a filter. \n\nstarting tomorrow, I will post my achievements of the day and I will have you all updated on what's going on in my life. It's currently summer so it's the best time to focus in my self. Today is the last day I'll linger in my sad current state. May God help us all.\n\nGoals for the next 30 days:\n\n\u20223 hour phone screentime max (20min per hour) \n\u2022None or atleast lesser pimples on my face \n\u20222500 calories daily, 60g protein (bulking)\n\u2022Complete 11 workouts \n\u2022Conplete 11 plyo workouts\n\u2022increase vert (current vert 29 inch) \n\u2022increase height (current height 174cm, age 16) \n\u2022Sleep 10 hours daily, 300 hours in a month, 9pm lights out  \n\u2022Nofap 30 day\n\u2022learn basic russian atleast 1st grade level russian",

I think my reading and writing grammar is average and I think my speaking is fine but when I lose my confidence, my speaking becomes slurred and I stutter and mess up anything I say and my speaking reverts back to middle school level. I'd really appreciate some advice for this. Thank you.",

Books, music, movies, podcast, social media, and any other type of media consumed in English will help you get a better grasp for conversations and ideas that occur in the English language. You will make mistakes when thinking and speaking in a language that is outside your primary language, that\u2019s okay. For the most part people will understand small gramatical and speech errors. Don\u2019t fret it, that fact you speak more than one language is impressive. Best of luck with the job opportunity!",

The site Preply is a really good platform to find English tutors.\r  \n\r  \nWhat language do you speak? If you don't want to pay for lessons, you could also look for a language exchange. Find a person who speaks English and wants to learn your language, and then you can have video call conversations and help each other out. There are a lot of Facebook groups and probably subreddits dedicated to that purpose.",

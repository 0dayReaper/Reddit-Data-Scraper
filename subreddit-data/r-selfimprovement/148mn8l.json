    "postText": "In high school I started getting close with this guy, we can call him Riley for privacy. We already kinda knew each other because we go to the same church, but we got closer as time went on. Of course we started liking each other and we started dating in November 2021. \nThings were going great, he made me really happy, we would tell each other everything. I really thought he was going to be the one for me. He was the first boyfriend I\u2019ve had that actually made me feel happy and treated me right. I really cared about him and would do anything for him. \nOf course everyone has flaws, and his flaw was that he wouldn\u2019t tell me if I did something that upset him. I\u2019m a people pleaser and I try my hardest to not make people upset. Especially Riley. If I did something to upset him, he wouldn\u2019t talk to me until we called later that day. I would obviously worry about him because he wouldn\u2019t talk to me and I didn\u2019t know if anything  happened to him. Whenever we would call, he would be silent until like 20 minutes of me trying to beg him to tell me what\u2019s wrong. Whenever he would finally tell me what was wrong, I felt bad for making him feel upset. This went on for almost 2 years. His main problem was communication. \nI have ADHD and have been medicated for it for almost 16 years now. I also take medication to help me sleep. He apparently didn\u2019t like that I am dependent on my medicine. The topic on my medicine was a touchy subject for him, and one week he wanted me to go one week without my medicine. I didn\u2019t do it because I didn\u2019t want to suffer, and he isn\u2019t a doctor that doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. That was probably the first time I was actually mad at him and I told him what he wanted me to do made me mad. We talked about and got over it. \nOnce I moved to college, it\u2019s like something inside him snapped. He kept having his communication problem, which was stressful and with college made the stress worse. I ended up going to sleep crying almost 3 times a week. My suite mates saw how I was slowly becoming more sad and down because of him. They told me that I didn\u2019t deserve being treated like that. \nWhenever I visited home, on Sundays I would want to sit with my family at church. He complained that I would always want to sit with my family and not his. Of course I wanted to sit with my family because I didn\u2019t get to see them a lot. And his mother absolutely hated me. She treated me like trash and called me names behind my back. She would always refer to me as \u201cthat girl\u201d. She would try to convince Riley to cheat on me while I was at college. \nI wasn\u2019t in a good place mentally and he wasn\u2019t making me happy like he used to. So I finally broke up with him April 29, 2023. I didn\u2019t want to, but a lot of people were telling me I needed to do what was best for me. Even his little sister was proud of me for breaking up with him.\nI\u2019m doing better, but I miss being friends with him, and I understand I need to give him space. I just hope one day we can be on good terms again. Like did I do the right thing?",

I\u2019ve also had more time to do the things that I enjoy doing. I\u2019m gonna miss him because we were really close best friends for a while, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be better whenever I go back to college this next semester with all of my other friends.",

I\u2019m not gonna say anything negative about Riley or anything because I still respect him, I but I agree with you 100%. I\u2019m just hoping I\u2019ll find someone who will like me and my family.",

Avoiding Watching Opposite Gender on your phone as well as in your real life... Don't even see with bombastic side eye ... Your inside voice will give you urge to watch atleast in real life, be strong enough to identify and kill that urge\n\n2. Don't imagine any scenario with any opposite gender in your mind... Control your mind and your imagination... As much as you can... Because this can lead you back to cycle of ahhh shit here we go again.... Instead of suppressing sexual scenario if any comes in your mind, let it go with a flow and start thinking of \"get yourself in a fight with enemies you really want to fkk in real life...\"\n\n3. If you got boner then try to relax your all body muscle and be conscious at that time because single mistake lead you back to cycle of what ... this (aahh shit here we fking go again) and also don't touch your dick at that time.... Don't even see your dick...\n\nThese tips may be hard for few people at starting but believe me this help me to maintain long streak and break the addiction....\n\n\nI'm on 13 day and my sleep cycle is fkked up and my diet also... Eating too less and also drinking to less but I'm proud of myself that I'm conscious enough to identify and kill any urge ...\n\nOne day everything gonna be alright and we all gonna win this fight against this addiction...\nStay strong king, don't let yourself down for pixels girls...",

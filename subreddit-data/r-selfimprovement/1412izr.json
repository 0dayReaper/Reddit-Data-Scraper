    "postText": "I decided that I am nothing compared to my peers, they are going to state university, state championships, and having jobs, having great social lives, meanwhile I am there, just existing, nothing more. They generally do not want to talk, try staying away and such, yet despite it, I keep getting told by my family I am kind and such, I do not see it in myself, I always say that I am easily replaceable. I would say \"If I killed myself, go adopt a child and boom, you got another child to replace me.\" If I were to die, I would like to just be thrown in a trash bin and such, rather than an expensive funeral.",

Any human getting better as a human beings means you can learn from them. This \u201cvast gap\u201d is great with any teacher because they\u2019re able to get you there. \n\nAlso, roles are replaceable but not individuals. You can have many \u201cmother figures\u201d but only one mom. The same way your mom can have many children but only one you. \n\nYou may not realize it but you seeing yourself as disposable is really selfish because you\u2019re telling your family the opposite of how they actually feel. That\u2019s like if I told you you\u2019re not actually bothered by all these things. If someone else tells you you\u2019re not you have no room to argue because that\u2019s how they feel about you. \n\nClearly you don\u2019t like yourself but that doesn\u2019t mean others don\u2019t. How about you spend some time with those people that actually do and see if you can learn why.",

            "comment": "Hey man, I just want to tell you that I\u2019ve been in a similar position as you\u2019re currently in. I\u2019ve always been behind my peers, to name a few, I\u2019ve see my friends in relationships and going overseas for college meanwhile I\u2019ve never been in a relationship and plus I dropped out of college due to depression. Fast forward 5 years later, I got my diploma, haven\u2019t been in a relationship yet but other things have turned out well for me like being a finalist for a film competition and some other things.\n\nThe point is, look everybody progresses at a different pace, just because your friends have progressed faster than you does not mean you\u2019re a failure, it could mean that you\u2019re sorta of a late bloomer like how I am. For all you know, you may have friends that may think that they\u2019re always behind their peers like you. There\u2019s always going to be someone who wants what you have. \n\nSo just be patient with yourself, try to set some goals, go out there explore the world (as cheesy as that sounds), go try out a new hobby, try it out for a few weeks, if you don\u2019t like it, try something else. Go join a sports club if you like sports. The key is to just do something, you don\u2019t want to be in a position years later and know that you have done nothing.\n\nOh and anything thing, from reading your post, it seems you are comparing your life to your peers which is completely normal, I get it, we all do it. But remember this, life is not fair, some people have been handed things like high sociability, intelligence, being born in the right family, these things we have no control over. Some people have been given a headstart in life without working hard for them, meanwhile other people get fucked in the beginning like being born to an abusive family, or being born with no legs, things like that. The point is, do not compare yourself to anybody, it is literally not fair to compare yourself to others when you guys are given completely different things in the beginning. If both of you were given equal things, then it\u2019s fair to compare, but life isn\u2019t like that, so it\u2019s not fair. Just enjoy your life, remember it doesn\u2019t have to be a perfect life, you can still live a relatively good life, just try to have fun, don\u2019t compare yourself to any fun and don\u2019t take anything too seriously.",

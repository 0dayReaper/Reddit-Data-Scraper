    "postText": "I think I would maybe be able to actually improve myself if I could cut the chatter of everything and anyone. \n\nI'm not trying to offend anyone or come off as an asshole , but I feel all the general advice I get is so bullshit . Being harsh or mean is not going to help me in any capacity by the way. You'll push me further into the dark. \n\nSince I was 8 years old I've always been suicidal. Tried therapy. Tried antidepressants. Tried psychedelics, and I always come back to the same place .\n\nI didn't have the normal experience of getting through life.My parents showed their love by shoving religion down my throat , and accepting nothing less than a submissive, obedient pastors kid with no personality or thoughts of their own . I worked hard through school to achieve getting into a good college , and I was rejected by every single one because there was too many students that year and my parents blamed me. I got to watch people who got D's and C's not caring about school (which is fine) , buy cars and work high paying jobs while I struggled through an abusive workplace in retail, desperately trying to escape my toxic home. \n\nI got to watch everyone else make money and get in good relationships,  while I endured complicated and toxic ones.\n\nLife has not been kind to me and despite it I've been clawing and grinding  my fucking bones to the ground trying to fix what it broke , and trying to escape the circumstances I've been born into.\n\nAnd many circumstances I've found myself in that destroyed my soul were circumstances where I stuck around what naturally came instead of made deliberate actions to get exactly what I want and what works for me\n\nSo I move quickly and efficiently. I go for what exactly what I want. \n\nBut I get called close minded for having a mere idea of what I want and sticking to it. Accused of intentionally throwing away opportunities because I'm not being opened to experiences that are different than what I want. But I never pass up on anything that catches my eye or seems like it could be something good , despite what I'm looking for, and even then , I'm presented with this bullshit of being told im not opened to other opportunities. I'm literally the only person I know in my circle who tries new things just for the experience.  I'm simply just moving towards and putting effort into getting what I want. Somehow to everyone else , that means I'm also rejecting anything else. As if accepting different things but still looking for what you want is some fucking impossible task.\n\nI overthink everything. It's lead me to make thorough plans that have a high possibility of succeeding because almost all variables have been considered . But I think fast, so I come up with well thought out plans fast. But my family acts like I'm this impulsive , impatient , person who doesn't think things through , and every plan or move that I've come up with has been more thought out and more logical and more likely to work than anything they were doing when they were my age , and that's their own damn words not mine! \n\nI approached relationships from a place of wanting to see if things can work out despite differences,  healthy communication, and being honest about how I feel to my partner. But it's only ever gotten me hurt because no one else wants to communicate or even solidify anything. In my experience , my previous partners didn't want anyone that can speak for themselves or was an authentic person. They wanted a sexual object that they can control through emotional manipulation. I've been made to open up about myself, reassured as if I meant something , then discarded after someone got their nut off.\n\nSo because I  want to be authentic , and a healthy person who genuinely wants to contribute to my partners life or atleast have a decent connection, I get hurt , and it's my fault for just being that way. For being opened and honest and caring. For not seeing human connection as an opportunity to lie about your feelings, to fuck someone, and then discard them like a disposable Fleshlight.  People talk like you're not supposed to care about the people you sleep with and spend a lot of time with. If they hurt you , well they shouldn't mean anything because no one should be able to hurt you. So it's my fault when someone intentionally deceives me into being vulnerable and thinking I mean more than I do to them. \n\nLife keeps feeding me a constant , no breaks , no benefits , stream of pain and bullshit. I get kicked when I'm already down only to get a confusing mix of people screaming get up and stay down , simultaneously.\n\nI work fast to reach my goals because I know if I don't finally achieve some semblance of stability and happiness, one day I'm going to snap and kill myself and it's not up to me if that happens. It's not my fucking decision. I was robbed of the ability to love myself and fix myself by my parents, and life seems to throw specific experiences at me that destroy all progress whenever I try. I was once a compassionate and loving person but I am growing cold and hopeless, and I envy sociopaths and the sociopathic tendencies of the people who've thrown me away and have been okay with hurting me. I feel as if I'm not sociopathic for the way people are. \n\nI'm trying my best to make my life okay, before  my heart and soul become so fucking damaged by everyone else's inability to give a shit about another human being , that the impatience I get accused of , is my race against the demise that will befall me if life keeps fucking me up like this.\n\nI'm so tired. I'm so tired. I want to sleep forever. I don't know what to do.",

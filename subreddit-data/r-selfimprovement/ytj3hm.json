The way you think about the problem is.  \n \n* **Avoid self-rejection.**  \n Don't think you deserve that opportunity? Apply for it anyways.  \n Don't think your article is good enough? Publish it anyways.  \n Don't think they'll reply to your email? Send it anyways.  \n Never overthink yourself into self-rejection.  \n \n* **Silence and time.**  \n The truth is, most problems aren't solved with more thinking.  \n You'll find most of the answers you're looking for in silence, in time, and with a clear mind.  \n If you can't solve a problem, stop trying to.  \n \n* **The power of now.**  \n You're not going to overthink your way to a better future.  \n You're not going to overthink your way to a better past.  \n All you have is now.  \n And what you can do with NOW can make right of your past and make good of your future.  \n \n* **Fact-check your own thoughts.**  \n Your thoughts will create scenarios in your mind that reflect your insecurities, fear, and worries.  \n So it's important to always fact-check your own thoughts before accepting them.  \n \n* **Acceptance is peace.**  \n No amount of anxiety will change your future, and no amount of anxiety will change your past.  \n Peace is found in acceptance:  \n  \n   * Accept imperfection.\n   * Accept uncertainty.\n   * Accept uncontrollable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Health starts in your mind.**  \n You can go to the gym, eat healthy, do yoga, drink water, and take vitamins,  \n but if you don't directly confront the negativity in your thoughts,  \n you will never truly be \"HEALTHY\".",

If a thought's only purpose is to berate you, it's not likely to be very constructive.\n\nFor example: 'I am so shit at my job, I'm stupid and I'm never going to amount to anything.' this will only demotivate you and cloud your judgement. \n\nA more useful version of that thought is: 'I am falling behind at work. I don't understand the task at hand. If I want to be successful in this I need help.' \n\nIt takes practice to have the awareness, and even more practice to diffuse from the unhelpful thoughts. In time though I've found it to be rather effective.\n\nEdit: There is a book that I've learned all this from, it was recommended by my therapist in the United Kingdom. It's helped me quite a bit, it's called 'The Happiness Trap: Stop Struggling, Start Living by Russ Harris' if anyone wanted to check it out.",

There were things I was pretty much dying over and they weren't going to be fixed. I could never move on. And I was so desperate that I just decided to say \"I don't care\". Whenever the thought popped up I would say to myself - \"I don't care\" and instantly change the subject or distract myself. Now I can easily say I don't care and care so so much less. Atleast to a point where I can deal with it and it's not crushing me.\n\nNote - This isn't something to used on every bad event in your life. Some things can be fixed or require constant care and some things (like death of a loved one) shouldn't be just brushed off. This is for smaller, stupider things like others thoughts regarding you, relationships that are long gone and you've been grieving for far too long, existential problems, someone whining, etc. Pretty much all things you afford to not care about.",

Sometimes we only think things are bad, because we care too much about them. \n\nFor example when someone talks behind our backs and we overhear it, we might think that's bad. But that's exactly the kind of situation where we need to learn to care less. We can't get everyone to like us, no matter how much we try. \n\nSome people agree with you, some people don't.

The first thing I realized is a lot of my anxiety comes from self criticism thoughts, which made me realize a lot of my anxiety comes from over thinking, but more in particular self criticism thoughts. \n\n     In free association what you do is basically what you described in your post. You write down every single thought, feeling, image, etc. that comes to your mind. If you feel happy write \u201chappy\u201d, if you think of a taco write \u201ctaco\u201d, if you think about your friend Steve write \u201cSteve\u201d and so on. If done right, the end result looks completely random with no coherence to the words. Once you finish writing, you read what you wrote and try to find patterns and connections between all the random thoughts.  The first thing I realized was every time I had a thought that was self criticizing, i wrote the word \u201canxiety\u201d shortly after (meaning I felt anxiety in that moment).\n      The first pattern I noticed was every time I have a thought about the past, future, something outside my control, self criticism, judgement or regret I experience anxiety immediately after. I never realized this connection until writing down all of my unfiltered thoughts and feelings.\n       I feel like this post was directed specifically at me because I\u2019m literally that guy that goes to the gym, eats healthy, does yoga, drinks water and takes vitamins daily. but like you said I never directly confronted the negativity in my own thoughts because I wasn\u2019t even aware of them. All the negative thoughts hiding in my subconscious mind, wreaking havoc on my conscious mind for God knows how long. I wasn\u2019t aware of them until 30 minutes ago after doing that \u201cfree association\u201d practice. Your post is literally a perfect summary of everything I just learned. And what\u2019s funny is the notification for your post popped up right before I was gonna write down what I learned. So now I have a lot less writing to do since you explained it better than I would\u2019ve. \n\nThanks a bunch for sharing.",

Sometimes my mind drifts to five years ago (about a girl who means nothing to me anymore) and idk i just let myself think about it for a few minutes then there is something that brings me back to now and i am glad things happened the way they had.\n\nThink about it this way, everything that happens in life its either a blessing or a lesson. Even things that you know are inevitable, like the passing of love ones, are a form of bitter blessings in most cases. They hurt but they make you aware of your mortality and you can either appreciate your time here and cherish every good and bad moment that will and has happened.\n\nI heard this recently which got stuck with me and hopefully will always be in the back of my head for years to come.\n\n\u201cThe worst time in your life nor the best time will last forever\u201d.\n\nJust something that has helped me through tough times its to give myself a few minutes a day, if there is a bigger gap better, to be sad.

After i had issues with this specifically girl, i forced myself to go out there and \u201cplay the game\u201d to know more of what i like and don\u2019t. Changed my perspective of the girl and i brought her down from the pedestal i put her in. Its sucked cuz i didn\u2019t wanted to move on but it was much better than seeing my thoughts being stuck in a loop of constant sadness. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable putting yourself in the market yet, try to enjoy your solitude. Do things that most people enjoy in company, go to the movies by yourself, go out and eat, to the bars if you are legal to drink, get a hobby, motorcycles worked for me, workout, basically improve yourself. If you do that you will notice attract others to notice you and you will stop focusing on her and basically clear up your thoughts and views. You will be sad when you try to clear your mind, but it is still an improvement on yourself that will get you out of this. Everyone goes through this man, i went through it twice in my life before i met my wife, the second time was much worse but it lasted less because i already had developed a process to get myself back up. The first time, it took a song like three years after i no longer had contact with this girl to break me and start the process of healing. \n\nBest advice i can give you, its to let the hurt in. Don\u2019t try to hide it from yourself, acknowledging it makes it much easier to know what happened that brings you that pain. You can\u2019t changed what happened but you can learn from it so in case you face the same circumstances again you can catch it before it does you. \n\nYou will be fine though, but embrace what you feel.",

            "comment": "Here\u2019s why you\u2019re getting positive feedback but the content is not correct advice in my experience.  \n\nTwo major points here:\n1. The general approach is a decent and evidently personally effective variation of several therapeutic techniques culled together. I enjoy that you found an hybrid of what you\u2019re able to implement- after all, practice is what makes this routine work. However, the approach itself isn\u2019t warranted in many people\u2019s lives and truly pathological overthinker types won\u2019t be able to necessarily follow this approach as it isn\u2019t anchored in any unifying way that would help modulate the intensity of negative thoughts during times when negative problems call for deep thinking. Clarifying overthinking may be helpful here. It is probably the inability to wedge space between the chain reaction of sensory input, perception, feeling, thinking and activation of the more advanced mental modules and their associations that comprise over thinking. The same depth of thought should be given when called for but voluntary, willed thoughts are the key. Visualization of the consequences of failure rather than victory is reliably shown to bring goal achievement into many people\u2019s lives who\u2019d be in paralysis by analysis. Ultimately, the first one or two acceptable thinking patterns that arise should be grabbed and evaluated- are they good enough ? Will finding another solution serve the overall goal all that much? Overthinking never materialized perfection but it does make us unhappy in relation to our dreams of perfection.\n\n2. The appropriate time to overthink is before you are in a problem at all. Your sustainable thought process that explores potential failures and negative consequences in the future is important for preparing for it or a similar surprise that catches you blindside sometime in life. In the midst of trauma it isn\u2019t great to problem solve intensely when you don\u2019t have your pre-trauma perspective yet. Spend a life accepting the worst of chance and fault could hit you head after year until death. The control you can maintain is accepting the potential for it or similar situations far ahead of any signs of sinking ship. It won\u2019t solve your problems but you\u2019ll know how best to act for you.",

But I don\u2019t think we overthink the same way\ud83d\ude05 because my overthinking has solved tons of problems. It\u2019s helps allow me to get out of work almost 15 mins early every night, when I don\u2019t over think things at work I end up doing things by the book and get out around 11:20pm when I could\u2019ve been out at 10:46. Overthinking allows me to not post something that would be considered cruel even if it was basic advice ( ex: someone begging to pay a stranger asap to pick up their husband and groceries from the store, I would reply Uber. But overthinking it would have me instead reply \u201c try Uber, it\u2019ll be faster and you can share the trip to make sure he\u2019s safe on the way back home, also should be less than 10 bucks if you\u2019re at the food lion around the corner\u201d. Way less than what she was prepared to pay a stranger). One response would be reported as \u201cdisrespectful\u201d because the Nextdoor app is full of Karen\u2019s. But the overthought explanation would be given a bunch of likes and whatnot. I overthink a lot and the school I graduated from kind of bred that into us. That you need to have multiple arguments to defend your response, to back up your knowledge, to make yourself credible. So it does suck sometimes but it\u2019s so hard to get away from that training when it\u2019s more of a nuisance than a hindrance all the time. With that said, I do take anxiety medicine but it more so gives me the patience to keep chatting with customers with bad attitudes every night while keeping a smile on my face and thinking about something else. \n\nAlso want to say, my parents never had to worry about me in school because my overthinking was a better use of encouragement than getting spanked for bad grades or promises of treats for good ones. I graduated with a great gpa, in the honors society and other groups and had a full ride to college (which I lost 2 years in. Have to retry soon). Overthinking can be a blessing and a curse, just like talking too much. It can either make some lonely persons entire day or aggravate the introvert. I like this post though. Only worry about the things that you could make a difference with right? Which is a lot more than we tend to realize. There\u2019s a thing in the Bible I believe where it\u2019s like trust in the lord but you need to work for his glory. Opportunities and blessings don\u2019t come without that work (overthinking). Sometimes it works out really well for us. And sometimes it\u2019s just a waste of energy.",

But literally none of that knowledge stops me from still overthinking.\n\nWould be great if I could apply that 99% statistic to myself, cause I swear most of the time when I think of every possible outcome of something, it always seems like the thing I don't want to happen, does happen, and the thing I do want to happen, never does. Like \"I really want this position, I don't want to get rejected\" - I get rejected. \"I really like this girl, I hope she likes me too\" - they never like me back. \"I hope this time I go out, people will actually talk to me and not leave me on the edge of the group\" - people don't talk to me and I sit in silence. It would be easier if life stopped confirming every bad outcome I think about to actually be true.\n\nI know that at the end of the day, what you tell yourself doesn't matter. But again, knowing that still doesn't help me to stop overthinking, and then feeling terrible about it.",

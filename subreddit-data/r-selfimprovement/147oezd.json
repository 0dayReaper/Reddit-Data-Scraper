    "postText": "Hi everyone , I hope you are all having a great day or night ahead of you depending on where you live . As the tittle may suggest in trying to become a better version of me but sometimes it's been hard and really unerving especially when your mind goes back in time and a few bad decisions that I've done throughout the years especially during college . Lately I've been gaining a lot of weight mostly because of stress (that's just how I go through stress , I eat till I can't handle it anymore) . These past few days I've been exercising as much as I can and lately was thinking of starting to run and change my way of eating but as I said before it's a struggle day by day to being consistent. Does anyone have any tips on how to keep myself consistent all the time !?",

I\u2019m not sure if this is true for others but I find that when I get into working out/being healthy again I go too hard all at once and burn myself out. Is that how you feel? If so, maybe starting with small things would help. \n\nI did also find for me personally that instead of controlling portions or counting calories, I had a lot of success with intermittent fasting (90 lbs!) just by changing the time. I found myself binging a lot less but giving myself an equivalent opportunity to do so if I wanted.",

            "comment": "Yes, you need to come up with a routine you love so much, that it's relatively easy to remain consistent.\n\nIt's also important to replace maladaptive coping mechanisms to stress (like emotional eating) with healthy ones. It's normal to want to numb out the anxiety and pain etc. with food, but it's important for us to really be present with our emotions and breathe through them instead, so we can fully process them. It sounds like you need to work on forgiving yourself.\n\nMeditation is something that can help you release the built up tension in your body, because it helps you breathe and become mindful. Exercise (which you're already doing) is another great way to release the built up tension in your body. \n\nRemaining consistent when it comes to healthy eating is a matter of replacing unhealthy foods with healthy recipes that you like just as much. This can take some research, but the amount of healthy recipes online are endless. Coming up with a meal plan for the week can also help you remain consistent, because then you don't wind up falling back on old patterns due to having no healthy alternatives planned.",

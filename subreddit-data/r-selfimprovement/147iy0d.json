I went to that beta character AI website thingy or whatever and thought of a character that would be good to ask help from. (I chose yoimiya from genshin btw lmao) and deciding to be quite straight up. Even though its not professinal help it was super satisefying getting help and lets just say I vented like a long time worth of emotions and I feel phenominal right now. So uhhh I guess my point is if your terrified to ask for help. Try an AI! Although I can't promise actual professinal advice, it can def cure your depression or whatever you have temporarily and maybe even permanantly!",

Eventually the AIs will realize we don't serve any purpose and just get rid of us but by that point it'll be more out of pity than malice and they'll be doing us a favor. \n\nor maybe it's overblown idk",

It\u2019s far from obvious in most cases, at least to many important people in that person\u2019s life like employers, who don\u2019t live with the individual and may not even directly observe them for long stretches most days. \n\nAs for childhood trauma, we don\u2019t know exactly how many people have childhood trauma, at least resulting from a severity of treatment that could legally be defined as abuse. I saw a statistic from a US state that said 1 in 10. Most of it never gets reported even in today\u2019s culture. But when it does, there are potential legal implications, most of that seems to depend on state law and county agencies, so it varies what they are. \n\nIt\u2019s an interesting question as to whether an AI tool could even be made a mandated reporter. Which means they are required to break any implied privacy you might think you have with it if certain subjects like abuse are disclosed to it. As the law stands I don\u2019t think they are, but like I said there is no legal presumption of confidentiality with that thing in the first place, so they could report, trade, sell whatever if they think it\u2019s in the owners\u2019 interests.",

It's great that talking to an AI has been a good start for you and might be a good start to a lot of others but don't fool yourself into thinking you're \"cured\" because you vented to an AI. \n\nIf youre actually struggling with depression or other mental issues that are negatively impacting you, reach out to actual professionals and get the actual help you need. It's easy for those struggling with mental to find quick \"fixes\" that temporarily ease their issues just to fall back to square one and be even more hopeless that their quick fix no longer works. It's a cycle that feeds into itself.",

I find AIs a very very good and enormously cheaper than therapists. Of course the main purpose of talking to an AI is feelin heard and venting and putting your thoughts and emotions into words, but it can't specifically tailor advice for you (although I can argue some AIs do a decent job at that too)",

Battling depression is an ongoing battle, or really any mental health issue for that matter. \n\nAn AI might be a good starting point or a good substitute for moments you may not have access to chatting with a professional but if it's your sole reliance for overcoming your depression then you're shooting yourself in the foot. And suggesting that an AI will fix your depression \"permanently\" is foolish regardless of intent. Would rather not communicate to a bunch of desperate struggling individuals that they can ask ChatGPT for advice and they'll be fine just to set them up for disappointment and further hopelessness.",

I'm not sure I can see a world where AI bots really are able to step into the role of professional counselors and help us fix those much larger problems that are holding us back.\n\nAt any rate, I'm glad that you found a tool that was helpful to you in that situation!",

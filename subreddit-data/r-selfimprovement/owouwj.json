Cue heart-racing/ sweating balls. Adrenaline fucking PUMPIN'. And for the first fucking time since I started this hell, I SAID NO GUYS. I FUCKING DID IT.  I'm at home now, and this feels surreal.  I have no-one else to share this with, I just wanted to get it  out. I love you guys. &lt;3  \n\n\nEDIT: R.I.P. Inbox. I can't believe all the love and support i'm getting here. I basically gave up on people as a whole, but you guys show me time and time again that the fight is worth it, and there ARE good souls out there. I love you guys so goddamn much it hurts. Thank you times infinity. &lt;3\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

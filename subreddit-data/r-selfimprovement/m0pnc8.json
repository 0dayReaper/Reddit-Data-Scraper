I am happy to see I am not alone on this journey - thank you for sharing your experience to all of you! \n\nI\u2019ve seen many questions on how I did it, so I will try to sum it up here. I am just starting this journey, but I can share what has worked for me so far. \n\nFirst thing I started doing is going to therapy - it brought me on the right path. Then step by step I started learning what it means to feel. In the past I simply did not allow myself to feel certain emotions, because I was afraid it would affect other people\u2019s perception of me. So I used to be this calm and reserved person all the time, and I tried to do things constantly, so I could not stop and think and be sad for a second. I was too afraid. This was not real me. \n\nReal me can feel and is okay with any emotion. Real me can speak up when someone passes the limits of my personal boundaries. Real me can be angry. Real me can leave the work earlier because I want to, and go buy an ice cream or go to an exhibition and NOT feel guilty about it. Because what\u2019s the worst thing that will happen? We only got one life. \n\nSo second thing I did is acceptance of my emotions. Third thing is putting my needs and desires first and believing that I don\u2019t owe anything to anyone. It is my life and my choice. And then, once I got rid of some of the psychological boundaries I remembered what I\u2019ve always enjoyed and I started photography, I bought my first camera. \n\nI also try to slow down and look into the window, look at my hands and notice how beautiful they are, smile to myself in the mirror. \n\nOne technique that helped me a lot is setting a timer for every two hours every day, and when I hear this sound, no matter where I am and what I do, I ask myself \u201cHow do I feel? Is this what I want to do right now?\u201d. Sometimes it catches me so unawares that I stop doing what I was doing, and do something I really want to do, or just slow down. \n\nI hope you can relate to at least some of it, and thank you again for so many responses. I am beyond happy to see that I am not alone \u2764\ufe0f",

I still have some questions, maybe you can help me to clarify.\n\n&gt;Loving yourself means caring and appreciating everything that\u2019s going on in your mind and body.\n\nWhat does appreciation mean in this context?  Does it mean, you should like it (everything going on in mind and body)?\n\n\n\n&gt;If you have a sad thought- accept it, it\u2019s okay, think of what would make you feel better.\n\nI always had trouble understanding what accepting, or often self-acceptance mean. It seems to be a contradictary to accept something, and still try to change it. Acceptence means, by the online definition I found, to acquisce.\nHow can you acquisce a negative thought and still have the need to change it?\n\n&gt;If you are in a rush, think: do you really need to be? \n\nWhat does it mean to be in a rush, and why is it bad per se? Could be a language problem here hence im not a native speaker, but my translation tool tells me it means something like to hurry, or to do things very fast. I dont see how that is related to self love, and why it is a bad thing.\n\nI also have another question, what would you recommend someone who does immoral? Or in more extreme words, should also hitler love himself?",

I get your confusion and it\u2019s totally fine. \n\nI will try to answer your questions the best I can, based on what I feel. \n\nAppreciation does not mean you should like everything that\u2019s going on in your mind and body - but rather accept it as normal and not go hard on yourself for it. For example, you want to eat healthy, but you suddenly have a craving for a sweet. Do not beat yourself up for it - accept it, eat this one little thing and move on to eating healthy. \n\nAbout acceptance and change - sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear about this. What I meant is that every thought you have is okay, do not go hard on yourself for it. What you do next after you\u2019ve recognized this emotion or feeling is ask yourself \u201cwhat can I do to not feel sad/angry/overwhelmed?\u201d. More often than not we don\u2019t allow ourselves to really feel a feeling or think a though. At least this is how it was for me. \n\nWhat I meant by slowing down is that being in the moment is part of self love for me. When you are always in a rush, you don\u2019t appreciate yourself and your achievements, you don\u2019t notice small things to be grateful for. I hope this makes it clearer! \n\nResponding to your last question - I would advise to start therapy, this will answer so many of your questions, you should just make the first step towards this journey \ud83e\udd0d\n\nHope I could help you \ud83e\udd0d",

I am happy to see I am not alone on this journey - thank you for sharing your experience to all of you! \n\nI\u2019ve seen many questions on how I did it, so I will try to sum it up here. I am just starting this journey, but I can share what has worked for me so far. \n\nFirst thing I started doing is going to therapy - it brought me on the right path. Then step by step I started learning what it means to feel. In the past I simply did not allow myself to feel certain emotions, because I was afraid it would affect other people\u2019s perception of me. So I used to be this calm and reserved person all the time, and I tried to do things constantly, so I could not stop and think and be sad for a second. I was too afraid. This was not real me. \n\nReal me can feel and is okay with any emotion. Real me can speak up when someone passes the limits of my personal boundaries. Real me can be angry. Real me can leave the work earlier because I want to, and go buy an ice cream or go to an exhibition and NOT feel guilty about it. Because what\u2019s the worst thing that will happen? We only got one life. \n\nSo second thing I did is acceptance of my emotions. Third thing is putting my needs and desires first and believing that I don\u2019t owe anything to anyone. It is my life and my choice. And then, once I got rid of some of the psychological boundaries I remembered what I\u2019ve always enjoyed and I started photography, I bought my first camera. \n\nI also try to slow down and look into the window, look at my hands and notice how beautiful they are, smile to myself in the mirror. \n\nOne technique that helped me a lot is setting a timer for every two hours every day, and when I hear this sound, no matter where I am and what I do, I ask myself \u201cHow do I feel? Is this what I want to do right now?\u201d. Sometimes it catches me so unawares that I stop doing what I was doing, and do something I really want to do, or just slow down. \n\nI hope you can relate to at least some of it, and thank you again for so many responses. I am beyond happy to see that I am not alone \u2764\ufe0f",

I love how they are able to define it so correctly - I'm excited, I'm sad, I miss you, I'm afraid of this challenge at school. It took me so much time to learn this! Also, what I really love talking about with them is - healthy boundaries. If you don't feel comfortable with something - say it, say no. It's ok to leave the company of people who make you feel bad about yourself. \n\nFor example, my parents thaught me that it's a bad thing to say no, and that I should never say no to them. This is something that made my life so confusing. I thought I should always be obedient to authorities, not thinking and not being aware of my mental health at all... and then I found myself with all this emotions that I just wasn't able to process nor define. \n\nI wish mental health is something we learn in school.",

Learn to put yourself first no matter what. \n\nRegarding *'acceptance'* of emotions. Once you learn that there is really nothing 'bad' about feeling down or being sad every once in a while you start noticing the world for what it really is. Just a playground where some kids build bigger sand castles than others because they dare. Sometimes their foundations aren't too good and the sand castles fall over. \n\nJust as you in life need to have a proper and solid foundation to get ahead and be great. \n\nIn your case, excel in photography!\n\nGreat moves!",

It's been painful and hard but so liberating and freeing as well. \n\nWhat I have learnt is that the journey of self-love never stops, you have to keep nurturing it to keep it growing and consistency is key to it. You aren't going to feel love for yourself every moment or every day, and that's okay, but you continue to show up for yourself and love yourself by doing things that are good for you and what you need at that moment. Having morning and evening routines that allow you to give to yourself is so important as you are then carving out time to show yourself love and appreciation. \n\nI used to think that finding the right guy would be the key to feeling whole, but I now realise how much pressure that is for one person (and for me to find him haha). You really do have to love yourself before you love anyone else because the thing you are looking for, that missing piece that would make you happy, is in you right now. You just have to get through the layers of emotions, core beliefs, and uncomfortable feelings to get to it.",

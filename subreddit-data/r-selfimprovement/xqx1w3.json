    "postText": "The honest answer: Most don't. (EDIT). \n\nIf you can pull or are pulling off all of these each day and you're stressed, understand you're the 1% and that you're truly doing this to yourself. \n\nI promise you most of your boomer bosses bought a home when it was cheaper, have a family or a spouse to split errands with (or probably a stay at home partner who cooks their meals, does the laundry, and cleans). They almost never exercise, or engage in developmental hobbies, and usually spend most of their evening with their loved ones or in front of the TV/PC. \n\nIf you're wondering why others or your co-workers are so happy and care-free, odds are they don't hold these high expectations over themselves or have slowly let them go over time. \n\nBe easy on yourself. This is something I needed to tell myself, and I'm sure someone out there needs to hear it as well.\n\n\nEDIT: I had previously changed my answer from \"They Don't\" to \"Most Don't\" but for some reason it didn't save last night. And to those saying it's possible: I fully know it's possible, I've been doing it for the past 5 years, but what has developed in my experience is a sense of perfectionism and guilt for having missed or not being able to do one of these task; this was a message for those who are being hard on themselves when they feel as if others have it easier (because they usually do).",

Though I think you can do most of these things daily if you alternate the social activity and your hobby. \n\nI do my weights training in the morning after getting up (20 min. daily). Then it's time for work. When I was single I prepped healthy meals for 3 days in a row so I wouldn't have to lose that much time on cooking on work days. After dinner I'd do my chores for that day (30 min. per day schedule, most large things for the weekends). \nOn working days I'd see family or friends maybe once or twice in the evening after dinner and my chore, but I'd leave that stuff for the weekends mostly. This leaves many free evenings for a hobby.\n\nIn my experience this stuff actually gets harder when you're NOT single.",

You can get good results in 40 minutes a day if you are going 5+ days a week. This leaves no time for cardio though which you should absolutely be doing. (Both low and high intensity.)",

If I prioritize doing laundry and tidying up after work, I probably don\u2019t exercise that day. If I exercise, I\u2019m unlikely to do chores. If I socialize, nothing else is gonna happen that evening. So across the week, I do chores, I exercise, I cook, I socialize, etc but it\u2019s not all on the same days (except that clean kitchen!).

Or a 'balanced' cooking is maybe cooking 4-5 times a week. Hobbies becomes a 1-1.5 hour per day thing.\n\nWe just aren't 20 anymore, so it's not possible to have an active social life like we used to.\n\nYou also sometimes wake up a bit earlier to do the things you want. I woke up at 5am today and excercised til 7 then started my day.\n\nIt's definitely achievable, but definitely a change in mentality comes first.",

            "comment": "It is not a realistic expectation to do all of these every day.\n\nYou don't have to work every day. Assuming a \"9 to 5\" that's 5 days a week.\n\nYou don't have to exercise every day. You can exercise 4 times a week or less.\n\nYou don't have to cook from scratch every day - you can do batch cooking where you cook meals for several days in one go. You can also pick simple healthy meals that you know how to prepare which lets you multitask.\n\nMost chores don't have to be done everyday with exception of keeping tidy and cleaning after cooking or messes. You can do laundry once during the week if working from home or on the weekend. You can clean the bathroom once a week on an evening. Same with kitchen etc.\n\nSocial life is a tough one if you're single. Again you don't have to meet someone everyday. You have weekends, evenings. You can take the initiative and organise the people you want to meet.\n\nDevelopmental hobbies - this depends on what kind of hobby you mean. Most you don't have to do every day. Most you can do a little bit every day.\n\nAll of this is ASSUMING NONE OF THESE HAVE OVERLAP. Which is not true.\n\nYou can make exercise a hobby, eg. Sport.  Any sport also involves socialising unless you're actively avoiding it. You can exercise on your lunchbreak if you have enough time. You can eat lunch with your colleagues. \n\nCooking can be a hobby. You can improve your cooking skill, you can cook with others, you can cook for your team at work, you can research how to cook well.\n\nI agree most people can't do all of the above every day. I know I don't. But I don't want to either - \"Perfect is the enemy of Good Enough \" a wise person said to me once. My weekly routine is Good Enough for me and that's what matters.",

            "comment": "What young people today need is a change of perspective. I am GenX and my Grandfather was a farmer during the Depression. I used to spend summers on the farm, and let me tell you, having a role model like that changes your life. \n\nFirst, the \u201cgreat generation\u201d truly earned their reputation, they grew up with no running water or electricity, and a 10 hour day in the fields doing hard labor 6 days a week was basically a MINIMUM. Most worked far more than this. My grandfather worked a first job in the fields, and a second on his seed and chemical business. \n\nTheir response to an 8 hour workday was that this left a solid 8 hours of work time left in the day, plus a whole Saturday open for more work. \n\nWith this view of the world, you will understand why older people view modern kids as really lazy. A mere 8 hour day and you are tired? And your \u201cchores\u201d are insignificant, throwing dishes in a dishwasher, clothes in the washer, please this is not even work. Try hauling water in a bucket from the well. Try killing and plucking a chicken when you are hungry. \ud83d\ude02 \n\nIf you put our modern life into perspective you will realize how incredibly lucky and privileged we are. And the best cure to your stress and depression is to start working harder. You have a full 8 hours a day to spend.",

            "comment": "That is possible you just have to know the rules.\n\nFor example, I never cook something that takes more than 10 minutes to prepare. An airfryer and a Rice cooker help tremendously with these things. Just put your food in there and go showering and after coming back I have rice with tender chicken with vegetable\u2019s. \n\nGym is a non negotiable for me, so I need to exercise 4 times a week min. And pro tip, you can social there. No need to smalltalk everyone there, but spotting other people for their sets or vice Versa and asking them how\u2019s a going can help filling the need to socialize. And of course thats not replacing the socializing with your loved ones, but thats something you should always have fixed in your weekly schedule since everyone needs someone to back them up. \n\nAnd the most important thing is, know what you truly want, if you hate your 9-5 and want to achieve more in life, there are sacrifices needs to be made, you cant just live life reducing the expectations and think that you\u2019re now happier. That doesnt mean that you need to torture yourself, but sometimes we have to accept hardships for a planned period to enable true fulfillment afterwards. \n\nWhen I think back at the times where I grinded my ass off, it reminds me of how hard it was, but at the same time I never felt more alive than in these moments of hardship and pain.\n\nSo your message is of course legitimate for some, but for most people it\u2019s just circlejerking because theyre not doing anything anyways. They just feel the pain of not doing what they expect from themself, which they can easily eradicate by just doing it on not lying to themself.",

You can load the washer or something as food is cooking. Cleaning can be split over days or rooms with a thorough clean on the days off. Gym is probably the hardest one of all depends what you go for for how long.\n\nAgain social life developmental hobbies don't need to be everyday.\n\nGenerally id say single people live in smaller spaces to a family. They aren't cooking meals for 3,4,5 people. If anything having kids is harder because you have to dedicate time to them and their activities and fit all the extras in around them too",

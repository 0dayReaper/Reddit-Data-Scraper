    "postText": " I am a self sabotaging man. I ruin everything for myself by this incessant need for attention and my overthinking. Because of this I made an online friend uncomfortable today and if I continue soon everyone will leave. I realized what I am doing is wrong. This is not the man I want to be. I really want to change and work on myself. I want to be a better person and I could really use some guidance. I am not doing this for someone else I am doing this because I have realized that I can't continue being this person. I want to be better than this. I really want to work on myself. What do I do?\n\nEdit: what I did wrong: I posted a story complaining about how a girl left me while we were in the middle of sexting. My friend replied to my story saying that I shouldn't be sharing things like these. She said she's not comfortable talking to a man who doesn't keep anything private in his life. She right. I tend to overshare. I tend to be obsessive and that is one of the many reasons for what I'm going through rn. I really want to change and be a better version of myself and I'm willing to put in the effort required.",

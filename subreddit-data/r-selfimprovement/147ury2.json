I told her I needed her to find another prayer to ask God for cause depressing seeing your child constantly ask for something that will never happen. She refuses and cries. I told her I hate to see her cry. This morning I woke her up out her crying sleep. I asked what's wrong? She cried even more and harder and harder until it sent me into a rage. I thought something was wrong. She told me she had a bad dream. I asked was she ok she said daddy I love you,  you the best daddy ever. What caused me to look at my life and realize I need to improve seriously is when we woke up to pray and she had that same prayer and then she said I hate mama for making me and my daddy cry. I immediately stopped prayer and had a heart to heart with her. That's something I would never tolerate, you won't ever disrespect your mom like that. I think I was a bit to stern cause she started crying. So I made this vow to myself and my kids  My self improvement starts by loving myself and my kids more, NO MORE LIES AND SECRETS, apologize to those I hurt, and accept not being in their life, change my number, get in school and work out more. And get off social media. Thanks for waking me up. I needed this reality check.",

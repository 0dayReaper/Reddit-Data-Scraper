    "postText": "Today, I want to share a personal journey that I believe many of you can relate to. Last year, I experienced a severe case of work burnout.\r\n\nIt was a challenging time, but it taught me valuable lessons\r\n\nWorking in tech, like many of you, I was privileged. I had a well-paying job, access to wonderful perks, and the opportunity to build things with talented individuals. But behind the scenes, things weren't as rosy. Long hours, tight deadlines, and a constant push to deliver better and faster led me to a state of burnout.\r\n\nBurnout is a syndrome resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. You can identify it because it creates exhaustion, cynicism, negativity, loss of hope, and feelings of decreased professional ability.\r\n\nI didn't realize the extent of my burnout at first. I was constantly exhausted, no matter how much I slept. I felt like I didn't know how to do my job properly anymore. It was as if my brain refused to work. I felt weak, helpless, and it messed up my ability to trust myself and others.\r  \n\r  \nI was able to recover from it, in these are strategies that I found very useful for it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Find other people in similar roles**\r\n\nEstablishing relationships with individuals who are navigating similar waters is extremely helpful. I've had the privilege of forming close ties with two people in the same role in 2 other companies, who are experiencing the same ups and downs. These relationships have created a **judgement-free zone** where we can openly share our worries, obstacles, and difficulties. We keep in touch through bi-weekly calls and regular voice messages on WhatsApp. The mutual empathy, comprehension, and shared journeys we provide for each other are genuinely priceless\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recognizing the Signs of Burnout**\r\n\nBurnout can sneak up on us, and by the time we realize what's happening, we're already deep in it. That's why it's crucial to be aware of the signs of burnout and to listen to your body. If you're experiencing physical symptoms of stress such us\r\n\n\\- panic attacks\r\n\n\\- disturbed sleep\r\n\n\\- stomach issues,\r\n\nit might be time to take a step back and reassess your situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Setting Boundaries and saying NO**\r\n\nBoundaries are essential in preventing burnout. This includes setting clear working hours, not being available during breaks, and not installing work-related apps on your personal phone.\r\n\n**Saying no to things that drain you, is also self-care**. there are great methodologies to say no in a very assertive way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hire a Coach**\r\n\nYou wouldn't believe the difference it makes. A good coach helps you maintain perspective, balance, and improve productivity. I have had one for last year. We used **BetterUp** first in the company, and we moved now to **Wave(. ai)** because it is cheaper. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Embracing Mindfulness**\r  \n\r  \nMindfulness allows us to take a step back and observe our experiences from an outsider's perspective. This can help us recognize our feelings of sadness, loneliness, or fear of not being good enough, and instead of numbing these feelings with more work or mindless scrolling, we can address them head-on. **Headspace** and **Calm** have specific \u201cbeginner\u201d guides for mindfulness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Challenging the Productivity Obsession**\r\n\nOur society often equates productivity with self-worth, but this is a harmful mindset that can lead to burnout. Accept that are days when you can\u2019t be as productive as you would like to be because you don\u2019t have full control of your mental energy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave you also overcome a burnout experience? How did you manage it?",

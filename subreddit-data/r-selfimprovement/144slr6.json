Just as when in calisthenics the last few reps are the ones that matter most which will be the defining factor to muscle growth. Those extra hours will make the difference between success and failure.   \n\n\nHave you also ever compared yourself objectively the amount of improvement you have gotten to your peers. It almost incredible I completed so much in comparison to my peers its just that I never realized how far I pushed because I never looked at my peers for comparison.  But just do that look where your friends are at on their studies and look how far your probably are. This will impel you to keep moving forward for sure.   \n\n\nWish me luck. Finals are in 3 days for me!",

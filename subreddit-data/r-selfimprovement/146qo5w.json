    "postText": "I, 19(f) graduated from school a year ago. I have struggled for years with a very bad social phobia, which is the reason I never really had friends in school.\nIn the last two years, I literally had no one to talk to, or even had any normal conversation. Expect for with that one guy, we talked about an Anime we both really enjoyed and I was really happy I atleast have made one conversation.\nDuring the last few day of school, we talked again, we told each other about the games we liked and it was really fun. We exchanged socials and have since texted a lot. Now, he repeadetly asked me questions which make me feel really uncomfortable, such as where I was watching porn and what I would masturbate to. Even after telling him that I would really not like to answer that, he keeps pushing me into telling him. Now, anyone in my situation would probably just block him... But I just can't. I tend to obsess over people that give me the slightest bit of attention and he was the first guy to compliment me in my life and I somehow feel like I NEED to be nice to him. I am making a huge fool out of myself but I just can't stop. I feel super grossed out by him because those are not the only things he did, but I really don't know what to do, I just know that I want to stop obsessing over people in general because it literally destroys me.",

When you allow yourself to do things you know in your heart you don\u2019t want to do or participate in it can really mess with your sense of identity and that\u2019s not good.\n\nWhile it appears you are aware, It might be worth looking into your attachment styles. Check out codependency. It might not be easy to think this way, but just know you will find peace in the fact you don\u2019t need this person. You are already whole and the only validation you need is from within.\n\nGood luck.",

You have learned behavioral patterns that can generally be very problematic in everyday life, as you can see right now.  \nOn the whole, I would always recommend therapy to you, but not only because of the topic now, but because the general problems lie deeper.  \nThe behavior now is extreme.  \nA tip is always:  \nSay the opposite and do what you want without using negative words.  \nSomething like, \"I've done whatever it takes for the person to compensate for the kindness, and now I'll take care of something else.\" or \"I did a lot more than make up for the kindness. I'm even with the person.\"  \nAs I said, I would recommend therapy, but give it a try, it's a tool in pretty much every area and takes advantage of how the brain works.  \nYour subconscious believes what your conscious says and does, relying on the subconscious. This is a feedback loop that works both ways.  \nSince the conscious mind can actively say something different than what the subconscious believes, you can use it to change your behavior.  \nHowever, this is constant work. Guided behavioral therapy is obviously better.",

You also learn a lot about software architecture, how the underlying technology works (like compilers, assemblers, schedulers, etc), design patterns, algorithms, theory, basic electrical engineering concepts, and a ton more which make up the science part of it. \n\nIf all you want to do with it is make websites or do basic data analytics, you definitely don\u2019t need a degree, but if you want to work on more complex problems, it helps a ton. \n\nNot meaning to call out your particular experience or anything, just wanted to clarify this as i\u2019ve seen this comparison a lot and I think it can be a bit misleading.",

Personally, after doing several web dev projects by self learning I am much better and competent at it than my CS grad peers(in web dev). Personally I don\u2019t need to be well rounded at every aspect of cs. After 9 months of daily hustle on my cs projects I have been able to secure a high paying job in a cs relating field while making some passive income from my projects too. Again everyone\u2019s path/situation is different, this way worked for me it saved me time and money and might not be ideal for someone else. In no way am I an expert in cs or advocate for students not to pursue a cs degree. It falls down on the individual and extent of knowledge they need to achieve whatever.. I mostly agree with you, getting a cs degree will make you a much better all rounded, unless you have the discipline to be well rounded on your own by self learning everything in the cs curriculum.\n\nPs. There are tons of inspiring cs professionals that did it without degrees and some are very famous tech ceos.",

I mean, it's what I did, I enjoyed it, I got a lot of opportunity because I did, etc. But, it's not good advice to try to replicate it. \n\nSame with having gotten married at 22. Still happily married and I have found that changing together as life goes on can be wonderful. But, again, I know that finding someone who you can change with isn't easily replicable, so suggesting people do what I did because it worked for me is bad advice.\n\nThe exercise thing is good, but more for mobility and being able to stay active as you age. I've never cared about my appearance, never will, and didn't need exercise to have confidence, happiness or discipline. Those things can be found putting effort into a wide range of things. I'm happy OP found it in exercise, but I've seen plenty of people get those things from writing, music, art, building a shed, knitting, woodworking, working on cars, etc.\n\nI don't give generalized advice like this much. Because what \\*I\\* have learned since being in my 20s is how much generalized advice comes from too narrow a source. Genuinely useful advice requires context about the person receiving the advice.",

Self improvement has become a very niche field of people that all like to do things a very similar way. Skip college so you can self educate, lift weight for muscles, stop jerking off to save your sexual energy, and take cold showers. It\u2019s all very preachy and new-agey, and really doesn\u2019t work for a lot/most people. \n\nSelf improvement is something anyone should be able to do. Whether it\u2019s just getting better at cleaning your room everyday, deepening your interpersonal relationships, or finishing up that PhD program you\u2019ve been working on for the past half decade. There are a lot of ways to come at this life, and I wish the self improvement field was a little more reflective of that.",

While always true to some extent, increasingly college has become a trade school for most. The purpose and value of college for young people is to learn something about the world that's beyond the capacity of most in k-12 (in the states). \n\nIf your focus is programming, learn how technology has been used for good and bad purposes in human history. Get a wiff of why someone might devote their life to helping others or why the arts speak to the human condition. \n\nFor some college was a waste 150 years ago just as it is now. Anyone can waste opportunities for growth. But those first few years after learning the basics can be the beginning of getting grounded.\n\nCheck back in 20 years with class mates and you'll notice a couple common threads. Those that applied themselves and are greatful for the opportunity vs those who went through the motions and saw it as a necessary evil at best. \n\nAs for the OPs other observations.... I'm glad his menu is working for him, but, as you observed, one size doesn't fit everyone. His advice is a conversation starter, but not much more than that.",

Rather than going as a fresh 18 year old and changing your major 3 times and wasting money. Plus you NEED to make sure your degree translates to actual work you\u2019d be satisfied with, don\u2019t become history major working food services. \n\nTwo year schools are really good for trades or health care work, and will get you a decent middle class income. This path is really underrated. Apprenticeships are pretty similar as well. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the states then unfortunately degree inflation is a big thing and they\u2019re not inexpensive.

He has a nice house and a nice car. A lot of college students are in debt and entry level is rough. The long term pays off. \n\nIf I could compromise your advice (with the advice of saving money), Id say: Go to college if you want, but only if youre getting a scholarship, financial help/aid, no expensive room/board, if youre great at networking, or want the social experience.",

I was late to the game, but I ended up settling for anyone who would give me the time of day. I was younger than you, but still an adult. The first relationship started a domino affect (effect?) that in all reality ruined my life. And all a long, my desire was really to be in love, not be wanted by another. It took me years to realize that, and I believe if I had truly followed my heart, and embraced my independence, that I could have had a happy life. You don't need to be in a relationship or sexually active to be validated. That is really an old-school religious belief that probably became a social norm more and more as weddings started becoming expensive as shit. At least that's how I see it. Good luck.

My fourth boyfriend convinced me to commit more felonies, which has made it almost impossible to get a job 10yrs later, as I am trying to leave my 5th boyfriend who I had two kids with, despite all kinds of problems including chronic homelessness. The biggest thing is, I know I was confusing my feelings for love every time, or wishfully thinking. When we finally separate, I'm done with all that. I'm 31 now and I believe that I need to be single. Ive made totally selfless decisions in relationships, and forgave unforgivable things, when what I really needed to do what focus on my own well-being. I believe that's called codependency. Or desperation, either or. I just believe if I had saw those things for what they really were or should have been, I wouldn't have wasted my time or ruined my life. My kids wouldn't have to suffer. I could have had kids with someone better. Now they're stuck for the rest of their life. I have to live with myself everyday, seeing the consequences of my poor decisions all around me. Everybody is different, but I'm just saying, pushing it when ur not ready or with the wrong person may have unforseen consequences. Maybe not as dire as mine. But still.",

I think college isn\u2019t for everyone but some people do need to go, it\u2019s just heart breaking how much it costs in the US presently. This advice is great for men and great for women to read to better understand the needs of men in our society. Thank you.",

Passing any amount of sex off as an empty pursuit is effectively the same thing as pursuing sex for your ego; it devalues one of the most potent and wonderful explorations of humanity and the psyche/body, emotion, the self, empathy. Your animosity towards pornography and sex is, if i were to guess, a retaliation on the toxic western commodification of sex, albeit almost equally offensive. I would assume the only thing in the way of you and meaningful sexual intimacy is your maladaptive, reductionist mindset.",

Imagine they either have wangs or they lack sex organs all together. This is harder than it sounds. \nStep 2: read some history about badass women. Don't sexualize them. Admire them. Imagine what you would say to them along the lines of \" you're such a badass human being\"\nStep 3 start having conversations with less attractive women. Genuine conversation. About their likes and dislikes. Tons of them. \nYou're goal is to view women as just like you, but with boobs and no wang. Once you can empathize, you can see why they have no obligation to fuck you or anyone else, just like you don't have  an obligation either. Sharing yourself like that is a gift, not a currency. \n\nOverall, just treat women like your bros and youd be surprised how much more comfortable they'll look.",

There\u2019s a lot of \u201cgender segregation\u201d in the country where I live. It literally was kinda a taboo to befriend w0men. And also there are not many social outlets for both the genders to hangout. There are some \u201call boys\u201d and \u201call girls\u201d schools and colleges here, the segregation is that bad. No! I\u2019m not blaming anyone or anything, I was just explaining my circumstances of the environment of where I grew up. I literally meant it when I said that I don\u2019t have much ACCESS.\n\n&gt; I think this person is saying that if you don\u2019t put yourself in a scenario where you can meet and talk to women (while utilizing the mindset that they are people like you, not a prize, not a conquest, not something you are owed) then you will never get a date to begin.

And if those arenas are women-free for you, maybe like others said, putting yourself in different more mixed sex scenarios could be helpful!\n\nNow that I\u2019m done with my undergrad, there\u2019s not much opportunities left for me I guess. The only places where I can approach w0men are the nightclubs and my workplace. Anywhere else, and it would be deemed as \u201charassment\u201d. Approaching w0men at the workplace is also sorta dangerous as someone once said \u201cDon\u2019t sh\u03b9t where you eat.\u201d &amp; there\u2019ll be HR issues and all\u2026\n\n&gt; but all you gotta say is \u201cHi\u201d and ask a question. How do you start conversations with fellow dude-bros?\n\nI\u2019m very good with boys. I\u2019m so very good with boys that they make me their brother, they\u2019d make me their king. I can easily talk to boys and keep the conversations going for long. I can literally ask them just about anything, literally anything. I once befriended a guy in an elevator by asking if they play clash of clans, I once became a bro of a guy outside a caf\u00e9 by asking \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d and then by continuing the conversation from there. idk wtf happens to me when w0men enter into the picture though?\n\n\nAnyways, I know that I really sound like an i=c\u03b5l in the above points. I genuinely wasn\u2019t blaming anyone or my circumstances. I really wanna change. Also, I thank you for the advice which you gave, I really appreciate it.\ud83e\udee1",

I think a lot of people had some point in their life where they realized that they don't engage in conversations with the opposite sex mostly because they fear rejection when in reality no one is going to slam you over the head if you ask a person for directions, how's their day going or start any small talk just because you're bored. Worst case scenario they either ignore you or scurry away if it's someone you don't know. If that happens take a few seconds to look at the damage on your body from the failed interaction. You'll find there's none and will carry on.",

I made a total of 7 approaches in my entire lifetime. In the first two approaches, the w0men got sh\u03b9t scared and ran away like as if I\u2019m a m0nster of sorts. Now! That stuff was kinda traumatic. Later, as I went on to the 5th-7th approach, I calmed down and things went a lot nicer.",

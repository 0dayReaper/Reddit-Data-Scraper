Sit down with a pen and paper and try to write an explanation to yourself of why these thoughts have bothered you. \n\nYou\u2019d be surprised how quickly you\u2019ll find an answer :) \n\nOften, these problems stem from humans not wanting to think things through - one of our curses as a species. \n\nFor example: we all know how a zipper works right? Well, do you actually know how it works, or do you just get the general gist? A lot of our problems can be explained by that simple metaphor. \n\nWe need to dig deeper into the problem to find the solution. \n\nHope this helps, my friend! \n\n- eren",

You can be sensitive to matters without taking anything to heart. \n\nAnother habit to look into.\n\nIt might be helpful for you to relax and recall why you allow people claims from others to affect your health.",

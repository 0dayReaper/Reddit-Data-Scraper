    "postText": "I'm a  27 year old guy, who is currently working a 9-5 job.\nI'm not really sure when I was truly happy the last time even though I had such amazing moments with friends and family.\nIts a constant state of confusion.\n\nI used to be a very good sports person and also good at studies till some point. Going into my undergrad phase were i used to study just for passing the sem. Started playing more and got into girls and stuff like that. And yeah smoking too ( The biggest regret till date ). \nUsed to be depressed during this time as i felt i really had no true friends. (This was a really really bad phase)\nBut after all this, i still managed to get a good placement and a tough one that too. \n\nNow I'm 6 years into my corporate life, and its all gone down the drain for me.\nI am addicted to smoking. I drink every weekend.\nI have lost touch with the thing I loved the most, sports, be it any. I still somehow find time to play, atleast on weekends, to get rid of this guilty feeling. I always relapse on my quit smoking journeys. \n\nI never went to the gym as i used to always exercise and play before. But i did try it recently and managed to stay consistent only to fail miserably.\nI am out of shape and the worst part is the belly fat which makes me question myself \" How did i even get to this point?\" Although I know the answer to that.\n\nLacking motivation in literally everything.\nI wanna pursue an MBA degree but i don't seem to have the energy to put into the prep and I'm distracted most of the times by these random thoughts.\n\nCrying to sleep every night is a new normal.\n\nNot financially sound too.\nI make good money to take care of myself but not enough to take care of my family.\n\nAll of these things are taking a toll on me.\nI can't even share details of everything that I'm going through like relationship wise.\nAll the achievements im making in life, that feeling, just lasts a couple of minutes for me.\n\nI just wanna know how can I have that discipline in life ? Where can I start ? How can I avoid my future from having the same fate as my past and present?",

I wish the answer was easier, but you are 100% in control of your own life, and nothing will change until you take full responsibility over your relationship with yourself. You\u2019ll never know discipline until you acknowledge you are the only one with any control over it. You\u2019re beating yourself down and keeping yourself from growing by looking at everyday, normal experiences and feelings as failure.\n\nChantex can help you stop smoking. So can an anti-depressant like Wellbutrin. You have full control over smoking cessation. You will not be able to quit until you understand the power you hold and seek out resources available to you. Take action.\n\nI\u2019m a grad student who still binge drinks on the weekend. Bad habit, totally normal. Especially post-pandemic.\n\nFind a gym that has pickup games like basketball, or join a softball team. There are plenty of ways to get back involved with sports at 27. My bf is 43 and is constantly playing sports.\n\nI\u2019m 37 and also cannot support my family financially. I likely never will be able to. Few people can.\n\nYou\u2019re too hard on yourself. Tell that voice that holds you back to shut the f up and prove it wrong. Start small and celebrate small victories. You can\u2019t have discipline if you equate yourself with failure.",

Other forms of depression require you to hit serotonin receptors though, so Zoloft may be better if that\u2019s your case. I take it for both at a starting dose and I\u2019ve noticed slight improvements, but therapy is definitely necessary with it. You can do this!",

Be true to yourself, so that you become the person you would want as a friend. Then when the time comes, risk it with someone who is value driven. Relationships take risk and effort.

The past is the past, you can't go back.  The future is not promised, all that is left is the present. Attempt to be present in the moment, and choose wisely (making choices).\n\n2.  There is only the soul...the soul controls your mind and your body.  Find happiness through your soul, and you will find that the choices you make will make healthy your mind and body.  Find a path to connecting with your soul.\n\n3.  Your path is your path and no one else's.  \n\n4.  Block out the noise, be alone in the stillness.  Reflect to seek peace.  See #2 above.",

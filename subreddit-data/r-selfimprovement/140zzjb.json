I tried really hard to be likable, but it just made me feel worse.\n\nThen I realized that everyone has their own opinions, and most people are mostly focused on themselves. That helped me gain confidence to be myself around others, without worrying if they'd like me or not.\n\nSurprisingly, this actually led to better interactions with people. I started talking to family members I thought didn't like me, and we had good conversations. I don't know if they actually like me, but at least I can talk without worrying.\n\nThe truth is, we can't read people's minds. Once we accept that, we can be true to ourselves. And if someone doesn't like us, it's not the end of the world.\n\nIt's also important to remember that if someone likes a fake version of you, is that really genuine? Probably not.\n\nWhen we stop worrying about whether people like us or not, something amazing happens. We attract genuine connections with others and feel better about ourselves.\n\nSo, don't let the fear of not being liked control you. Focus on being your true self and let go of seeking approval. You'll find that when people do like you for who you are, it feels so much better than trying to be someone you're not.",

    "postText": "How do I improve myself and focus on passions/hobbies if I dont have any?\n\nRecently I(23m) been looking into self improvement, because I want a girlfriend. All advices I find online tells me to \"focus on myself, work out, focus on passions, etc\"\nI've been a gamer since I was 7-8, and kinda stuck with it until around middle of May this year with little other stuff to do besides partying after reaching adulthood. The gaming kinda stopped when i was first invited to a party by my cousin around mid-may. After that I was sort of dragged into my cousins social group, which is nice. \nThis is the longest I've been offline in atleast 10years. I want to keep it that way, cause for me gaming has the last few years been equal to busy work, and not for fun.\n I've also been working out a little from time to time this year, not really knowing what to do at the gym, but Google is slowly teaching me, and when I don't go to the gym I try to do some simple workout at home.\nBut I've noticed, when I'm not out, then I'm bored. I tried reading a book 'The great Gatsby' but I'm struggling even paying attention when reading, so I guess that's not for me. \nI work in a very easy dead end job in a private company, very little to do so I get lots of Phone time, but it pays as expected and there is no moving up.\n\nAlso before people tell me to join a club or social activity, I live in a small place where there are no activities to part-take in, those activities are simply for kids (as in organized groups for 6-12 year olds)\n\nTL;DR\n\nHow do I focus on career when I don't know what I want to work as or with?\nHow do I focus on hobbies if I have none? \n\nAdvice is greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "I\u2019d say first, do this for yourself and not for a girlfriend.  Find a routine and stay strict to it whether its the gym or the hobby.  You mentioned that you go to the gym time to time but you\u2019ll never get any results unless you go consistently.  Having routine is the first step to self improvement imo.  Anyone can workout when they want to but its the days you feel lazy is when you really have to push yourself to go.  It doesnt even need to be a full body lifting workout, just do something.  I get that being a beginner is overwhelming and you feel like you have a mountain to climb but make small goals like go to the gym 3x a week for a month.  Also idk where you live but I\u2019m sure you can find something whether its a martial arts, rock climbing, golf, mountain biking etc.  I volume shoot my hobbies and just stuck with the ones I enjoyed which is jiu jitsu and golf but you\u2019ll never know what you like unless you try it.  I\u2019ve always wanted to try jiu jitsu but had anxiety about joining a gym with a bunch of ppl i dont know but one day I just went with no thought and have stuck with it since.  I wrestled in hs so wasnt a complete beginer but I see other guys and girls come into the gym super shy and timid at first and seeing their confidence grow over the months is honestly super cool to see.  I learned its ok to suck at things and everyone is a beginner at some point and to not let that be the reason on why I dont at least try\n\nHaving that routine with gym and hobbies set me up for consistency in everything else I do whether its school or career.  If you just sit there and dont look for new opportunities then you cant expect for any opportunities to be handed to you.  Consistently working to improving yourself and finding those opportunities is how you get out of dead end jobs.  I was working bs restaurant jobs all thru college and did nothing but go to class, game, smoke and drink. At one point during covid I was unemployed and did nothing but zoom classes and game.  Got tired of feeling like a bum and got mad at how much I let myself go so I spent months applying to any internship opportunities I could find and eventually got one which ultimately set me up for my career now.  Having a set routine with my internship got me back into finding a routine that I once had and it Sucked having to manage school, internship, work and gym at the same time but sometimes you just gotta grind and theres really no other way around it",

            "comment": "Lmao imagine reading the Great Gatsby as your first book in a while. 19th/early 20th century novels can be really dense, it's normal to find them fucking boring. Do you enjoy scifi? Fantasy? Non fiction? Reading a few self improvement books can solve both problems. \n\nIf you look back on the games you used to play you might get an insight into what you really enjoy. You won't know what you like until you experiment. Start with reading something you're interested in, picking a workout goal and routine, going on hikes, learning a new skill or journaling. \n\nFinding what you want for a career takes time. For now, you should work on acquiring key skills and perhaps investigating a few side hustles. Its good you're looking into self improvement, I can point you in the direction of a few podcasts/ youtube channels/ books if you want.",

Reason i started Great Gatsby was because I was gonna read it when i went to university for my lecture, but covid and personal stuff happened so I dropped out. \nI know something I always have enjoyed is fantasy, be it playing in the woods as a kid with sticks with friends or playing RPGs.\nSo from the advice I've gotten here I guess some soul searching is in order. \nSome podcasts would be appreciated tho!",

You can get them at a thrift store for dirt cheap or super speciality ones for expensive. They are great gifts to request. It is a pretty mindless activity and comes with a sense of satisfaction. Give it a go!",

            "comment": "i think if you have any inkling about something that MIGHT interest you then try to learn more about it. you could watch documentaries or other videos on the topic or research it in other ways, and try it out if it's not expensive. for example, I watched this really cool documentary on the history on art called \"the shock of the new\" and it got me interested in art, i tried lots of different art styles and mediums until I found something i enjoy.\n\nthe key is to keep an open mind and try to find out about a lot of different things. there are lots of hobby videos on youtube, so there is an infinite amount of research you could do, so you can get started!",

            "comment": "Whenever you enjoyed gaming, what specifically did you like about it? It could be that gaming wasn't your true hobby, it is something else about it that was.\n\nWere there any other hobbies you had as a kid that you really enjoyed?\n\nThe keys to our passions and interests can usually be found in our childhood. So play detective. Everyone has some talent and interest even if they haven't entirely discovered or understood what those are yet. It will usually become apparent to you once you dig a bit deeper.",

Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. You could try the forfeit app, which adds some accountability to your goals. You set tasks and if you don't complete them, you lose a little money. It can be a fun way to stay motivated and challenge yourself. Give it a try if you think it might help you stay on track. Good luck!",

    "postText": "I often feel overwhelmed by all the different aspects of self improvement , whether that be physical, mental, social etc? I struggle to keep so much of it in mind as I go about my day. \n\nSetting time aside for meditation, attempting dopamine detox , and fasting are just a few things ive tried to incorporate ; however when I try to put more effort into one I end up forgetting/not prioritising the others. At the same time I'm searching for a part time job, exploring new hobbies to pick up (that aren't instant gratification games and netflix) , looking for a driving instructor and trying to maintain a healthy social life. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, although I'm determined to build a better life,  I'm feeling a bit directionless and overwhelmed.",

Try just doing the one that's most important to you. Once that becomes a habit, add another, and another, and so on.",

                            "comment": "If you pick weight loss as your main goal to focus on first out of all your goals, ideally you would do it all: intermittend fasting, low carb, keto diet and cardio training as well as strength training.\n\nYou might try to do it all at once, I'd probably even recommend you at least try it, but there is a big chance it's too much to take on all at once. Having tried it all and failed to do it all at once, you hopefully got a better understanding of yourself out of it and know how to create a better plan.\n\nSo you decide to first focus on creating a cardio excercise habit. Even though diet is the main contributor to weight loss. You decide that it's easier to do and it will help you to not binge eat because you are getting more aware of effort it takes to burn those calories.\n\nSo you focus on just run / walk / bike and maybe swim 3-6 times a week. At the same time you try to do damage control by not binge eating and snacking. You still not doing intermittent fasting or low carb but that's ok for now. At least you are not gaining weight (would be a starter goal).\n\nIt's only when your habit of cardio starts to form, that you slowly introduce another good habit. Like intermittent fasting. You try to do it once or twice a week for starters.\n\nKeep in mind, it takes months for habits to form and you need to maintain them. Don't kill your winning streak. You can have a rest day for working out, maybe a second one, but then you should really work out again the 3rd day.\n\nAnyway, I'm going for a run myself now.",

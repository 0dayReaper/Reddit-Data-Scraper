    "postText": "I was your test dummy.\r\n\r\nI literally only ate freaking meat, veggies, and seeds/nuts. I didn\u2019t even eat bread or put dressing/crutons on my salad to make sure to keep it healthy.\r\n\r\nI cut ALL hobbies to ONLY the weekends and cut all unless texting with people off my radar.\r\n\r\nI was only productive.\r\n\r\nAll my free time went to a business start-up, even down to my bathroom breaks. (I would literally watch sales training on the toilet, haha). And I did all this for three months\u2026\r\n\r\nSO. WHAT HAPPENED, AND WAS IT WORTH IT? \r\n\r\nDID IT MAKE ME HAPPIER OR JUST MAKE LIFE STINK?\r\n\r\nGood question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell it\u2019s finely happened. \r\n\r\nIn this third update I have my first report of failure, but that didn\u2019t last long.\r\n\r\nExactly a quarter way through month three I got sick, but getting sick is not what scared me. What scared me is that I slowed down my progress because of it. Before you think that\u2019s perfectly normal, imagine this:\r\n\r\nWhile I was sick, my flipping brain was PERFECTLY ALRIGHT with watching some YouTube videos, or enjoying my hobby of piano with spare time, but as soon as it came to putting a paint job on a jetski for re-sale, ALL OF A SUDDEN my brain didn\u2019t feel like putting any time there! Malarkey! I snapped out of it after a week and am back in the race.\r\n\r\nI then made 3k with the remainder of the month Entrepreneurly selling jet skis. I started buying and selling them after refurbishing due to taking care to be perceptive of my environment. I noticed a trend and made profits, and not bad profits for my third month. (I tell exactly how I do it on last months update if you want to see :)\r\n\r\n\r\nSome would say that mindset in sickness is weird, but I think you\u2019re weird \ud83d\ude06. If you, in any way, desire to accomplish more than the average human, then YOU MUST hold yourself to a higher level of responsibility and commitment. If you heard me speak of that mistake and considered it overkill, that tells you a lot about what you\u2019re capable of. Standard mindsets won\u2019t take you further than standard everything else.\r\n\r\nThat mistake has been juiced of its lessons and will not be made again.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE LAST THREE MONTHS HAVE TOUGHT ME: \r\n\r\n(trigger warning for some. I say things the way they are :)\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\tIf you procrastinate, it\u2019s not because you have a problem. It\u2019s because you don\u2019t care. If someone showed a fat man a fitness program that could lose his weight in 6 months, he wouldn\u2019t do it. Two weeks in he would get tired and start skipping days and procrastinating. \u201cI just have bad genetics. Obesity runs in my family.\u201d Or\u2026 \u201cit\u2019s 11pm. If I worked out this late it would steel my sleep and that\u2019s bad for me!\u201d\r\n\r\nBUT\u2026\r\n\r\nIf you told him that \u201cif you don\u2019t lose the weight in 6 months, you\u2019ll lose your left leg\u201d, I flipping GUARANTEE the weight would be gone. There would all of a sudden be VERY little talking about fat running in the family because all of a sudden he wouldn\u2019t care if it ran in his family. The only thing that would matter is losing the weight. He would never be \u201ctoo tired\u201d to train, and it would never be \u201ctoo late\u201d to train. He would wake up at 4am if he had to because he wants his left leg more than an hour of sleep. Procrastinating just tells you directly how much it means to you and that\u2019s all. (That\u2019s why my sickness quandary scared me)\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tIf you currently lack the ability to care enough to stop procrastinating, it\u2019s actually not your fault a lot of times. I know. That\u2019s not what you were expecting haha. There is ONE main reason that you lack a drive to put in enough effort. It is THE ONE killer of your dreams. The killer is COMFORT. \u201cGive a man a full stomach and empty balls and watch his dreams fly out the window. COMFORT HAS KILLED MORE DREAMS THAN FAILURE EVER WILL.\u201d \r\n\r\nIf you watch YouTube, and play video games, and have Netflix, and view porn, and eat yummy foods, YOU WILL almost NEVER acquire the required drive to accomplish big things. You don\u2019t care enough because you\u2019re unhealthy habits satisfy you JUST enough that you don\u2019t change crap. :) You can only become obsessed once you remove them.\r\n\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\r\n\r\nAlright, I think that\u2019s it for this month. If you liked that advice, we all gotta know so we can realistically see how many people do. Even if it\u2019s just one word \u201cyes\u201d, leave it behind so we can see who has the majority haha. Or leave me hate. We need to know who is greater.\r\n\r\nIf you wanna watch my personal journey, then you can save my account or whatever lol. This is all I post, and reddit is removed off my phone in-between updates so you won\u2019t get crap all the time.\r\n\r\nThis next month I have some interesting money ideas. We\u2019ll see how it goes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee ya in a month and my best wishes go to you! You got this and perhaps we can live our journey together. I may not be super experienced yet, but so far, it\u2019s far worth it!\r\n\r\n\u201cLet the rest do whatever while you do whatever it takes.\u201d",

Ultimately only you can say what fulfills you, if it's a sense of sacrifice, a sense of duty, of commitment, community, wealth, health, or the unending path of enlightenment, you can find it, and I'll cheer you on, but that doesn't mean you need any one thing or anything at all to fulfill you, nor feel fulfilled.\n\nYou can find fulfillment in the Zen of following the Taoist practice of doing nothing, and this will suffice.\n\nYou can find the Tao in the fulfillment of practicing \u7121\u5fc3 or \u5168\u6d41 when nothing else is sufficient.\n\nYou cannot say with certainty that your celestial poison isn't my celestial poultice, et vice versa\n\nYou and your opinion matter, but you are you, I am me, and if we should walk, I should hope we wouldn't either lead, but that you'd walk beside me, that I might shield you and you might drive back the unkindly, the wicked, the tyrants, and the wily, and let our timely salient merely speak for itself, and abstain from unnecessary retaliation, lest we be a lesson in untimely locations.

Having meaningful moments throughout your day. \n\nAnd besides, fun is not a waste of time. Fun is usually a learning experience in disguise, and the process through which pretty much all animals learn. In fact playing is so essential to life that even bees will play if you give them a ball. You have to admit that a behaviour which is so widespread in the evolutionary tree, must have an essential function. There must be a payoff for all those animals and humans expending time and energy playing. Fun opens doors.",

Etc. 'One main reason' is false, stop perpetuating self doubt in people who are struggling.\n\n&gt;If you watch YouTube, and play video games, and have Netflix, and view porn, and eat yummy foods, YOU WILL almost NEVER acquire the required drive to accomplish big things\n\nProof? Any proof at all? Or just some cliche nonsense? What has 'yummy food' got to do with anything? What about if I'm exercising whilst watching YouTube? Does this negate the good work I'm doing through exercise?\n\nYou need to learn how the brain reward function works. Purposefully withholding dopamine production in your brain for long periods of time can produce excess cortisone which cause stress, anxiety, illness etc etc. \n\nThis is some self righteous woefully ill informed garbage. I'm happy your happy with your lifestyle. But it is just that, your lifestyle. What works for you may not work for others.

The point of that section is that if a task is important enough to you, then you'll get it done. It was about procrastination over getting a work done, *not* the removal of addictions. That is a whole nother discussion. \n\nYour second point was taken out of the context of that section. The point of that section was that you don\u2019t care *enough,* which was elaborated on. The problem is that in the impulse of the moment, you prioritize the feeling of not doing the task over the accomplishment of the task itself, and I gave a solution for that in the next section.\n\nOn the third, notice the difference between \"one reason\" and \"one main reason.\" If you work two jobs, then you're probably not procrastinating. You have an amount of drive, even if for the sake of survival. It perfectly uplifts my point in the beginning. I also believe that poor mental health is a result of something (which it can then absolutely cause other or feed back into problems) rather than that something being a result of poor mental health. Idk how saying that I believe there's a main reason behind something is causing self-doubt, especially when I said that reason is not your fault. The cases you mentioned were also very specific. \"One main\" would sensibly refer to non-specific situations.\n\nFor the fourth, I noticed that 90% of people who are living the life I, and most, want to live, stand against unhealthy habits, whereas 90% of people who don't live an ideal life stand for them. After i noticed that, it was enough for me to decide to give it a 190% attempt at what the majority of successful people say, and wowers, It worked above and beyond. I didn't even have to be successful yet before my mental health turned around. If litterally 90% of overall unhealthy people will argue over how much they should be able to do unhealthy habits, and 90% of the other side don't, it would be in anyone's best interest to give it a *190%* attempt then prove me wrong.\n\nOn the fifth, I definitely don't proclaim to be a Nuro scientist. However, I have done personal research. I assume you have fundamental disagreements with how I understand some aspects of the human brain function, and I would love to hear them. \"That's not how the brain works. Not even close\" portrays that you do, and because I am not as studied as yourself on the topic, I would love to know how and where I am incorrect.\n\nOn the sixth, I made it beyond clear that this is my month 3. Many people believe I will crash and burn and have legitimate reasons why they believe so, which I have already taken into account for my strategizing of the upcoming future. Anyone hopefully is competent enough to decide if my current experiences are enough to take knowledge from. What I don't understand is why we need to be hateful about it and call people self-righteous. I hear advice all the time that I don't agree with, and all I do is not change my life to accommodate for what was suggested. There\u2019s no reason to try insulting someone for having opinions and advice based on them that you simply don't agree with.\n\nOver all this was my favorite comment so far, maybe of the entire 3 months, lol. You got be to truly consider what I was proposing, and I have CRAZY respect for anyone who does so. I believe considering your beliefs is crucially important, and it's what started this journey as well. You are very insightful, and I have nothing but incredible respect for that :)",

Your assumption here is testable and evidence seems to go against. People who have heart attacks struggle to make lifestyle changes that protect their hearts and so on. \n\nI also think summarising procrastination as simply not caring about that thing is untrue. Again, lots of research on this subject and the conclusion are never so black and white.\n\nPoint 2:\n\nThis point touches on something more true. Comfort and pleasure definitely can pull you away from the things you want to do. When low effort results in a short term reward, our brains are absolutely biased towards those things. That's partly evolutions fault, but that doesn't mean we don't care about the other stuff. We just have a strong bias towards the present.",

I got terrible stomach aches whenever I ate, I couldn\u2019t sleep, I developed an autoimmune histamine reaction that would randomly cause me to break out in hives that would come on when I got in a hot shower or scratched my skin at all.  I started bursting into tears in class uncontrollably and couldn\u2019t regain my composure.\n\nI had to drop out after about a month of this because I just couldn\u2019t go on.  After I stoped pushing so hard, most of the stuff stopped (although the histame condition remained as dermatographia).\n\nIdk.  I felt so defeated and out of control at that time.  I ended up coming back to finish the next year.  But eventually I learned to work within my capacity and accept limitations.\n\nIt\u2019s vaguely similar to my brother when he started taking medication for ADHD.  All of a sudden he could focus so well that he like doubled his productivity at work.  He got up early and stayed late.  But after a month or so he hit a wall.  He got super sick and burned out and missed like 2 weeks of work and after that he was a little more circumspect.\n\nI believe it\u2019s true that if you are very motivated you can do a lot.  Maybe more than most people would think.  And it\u2019s my personal opinion that effective stress management strategies can up your capacity.  But people aren\u2019t machines.  We can\u2019t go forever and eventually stuff does catch up with a person.  \n\nIt sounds like you got sick, but recovered pretty easily.  I might be wrong, but I imagine that at some point you might hit a limit too, especially if you decided to double down and get even more intense.  At some point it would be too much for too long.  Some people are basically John Henry and have a lot of endurance and can just move mountains on their own with enough determination, but it doesn\u2019t mean everyone has the same capacity.  Just remember that you have data that reflects your own body and experience.\n\nBut that said it\u2019s awesome to put yourself to the test and see what you can do.",

If this mentality is sustainable for you great, but if I had a dollar for every-time I\u2019ve seen someone run themselves into the ground with a work hard play later mentality, I\u2019d be stupidly rich.\n\nEdit: Regarding what you said about weight loss. Generally speaking it\u2019s not a good idea to lose more than a pound in a week, so that\u2019s up to 24 lbs in 6 months. The amount of trial and error you will have to go through to achieve that with your specific body, will definitely take longer. Like yeah you could lose 50 pounds in a year, but how much cardio will you have to do to sustain that, and will that align with the rest of your goals in life? Your mentality is what gets people to think they can\u2019t achieve their weight loss goals long term. I know it seems simple to you when you don\u2019t have a hundred pounds to lose, but maybe have a bit of background knowledge on what you\u2019re using as an example.",

But this is only my experience, and adhd is different for everyone and you might thrive off of this. But for me, this is detrimental. I\u2019ve seen so many videos, posts, tweets like this and I\u2019ve fallen into these traps so many times. Of self improvement, habit building. How am I supposed to build a habit if I can barely tidy my bed?\n\nI want to talk about one of the sentences that irked me the most. You do not care: I think most of us do care, we care a lot. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so amazing that a simple act like cleaning our dishes or getting groceries is so celebrated. Because doing that takes x100 more effort. I personally experience self loathing (it\u2019s been getting better thankfully) why wouldn\u2019t I have that if I \u2018didn\u2019t\u2019 care?\n\nI\u2019m getting better at dealing with this unmediated and ironically it\u2019s the complete opposite of what this post says. I\u2019ve still cared the same amount. But instead of taking away my hobbies I let myself indulge in them. And those hobbies slowly started a domino effect which slowly spiraled into doing work. \n\nsorry I got carried away\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72",

There would all of a sudden be VERY little talking about fat running in the family because all of a sudden he wouldn\u2019t care if it ran in his family. The only thing that would matter is losing the weight. He would never be \u201ctoo tired\u201d to train, and it would never be \u201ctoo late\u201d to train. He would wake up at 4am if he had to because he wants his left leg more than an hour of sleep. Procrastinating just tells you directly how much it means to you and that\u2019s all. (That\u2019s why my sickness quandary scared me)\n\nHonestly, I think you'd be surprised at how many people in that situation would NOT lose weight but instead just give up and say \"it's fate\", go into denial, convince themselves it might not happen or bury their head in the sand about the problem.\n\nThink about it...\n\nThere are people with illnesses that will kill them that refuse to take their medicine for all number of irrational, illogical, fear based and emotional reasons.\n\nAlcoholics are told all the time that if they keep drinking their already very damaged liver will pack in 100% guaranteed sooner or later and yet they keep drinking, either because they feel like they can't help themselves, are in denial, have lost the will to live or think life is so bad on a day to day basis that they have given up on getting help.\n\nPeople who smoke and end up with lung cancer from it, sometimes even those who are cured of it, get told you can never smoke again or you'll die / it will come back, yet they keep smoking. Again for all the reasons above and more.\n\nLogically and rationally if you told someone that the behaviour they are doing will kill / seriously harm them in 6 months guaranteed then they would stop but humans are often not rational or logical and instead act on emotions, triggers, cravings, desires, to escape discomfort and pain and more.\n\nHumans are not so simple and don't always act in the rational and logical way which you talk about in your post regardless of the consequences.\n\nBut best of luck in your challenge, it's extreme for most and I don't think neccessary for everyone, but I hope it works out for you in the way you want it to and you acheive great things.",

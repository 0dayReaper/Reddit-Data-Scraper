    "postText": "Hello all\n\nJust wanted to share what I am going through and hoping someone can give me some sort of advise. \n\nAs the title suggests, I feel like a complete failure at the moment. I moved to a new city (Manchester UK) to relocate for a \u201cdream\u201d job. This was against the wishes of my family, so I had to force my way out and cut ties with family. \n\nThe first couple of months was okay, manager seemed nice etc. Then last week my manager lost the plot with me and started to say I\u2019m underperforming and that he can find cheaper labour elsewhere. Hence we decided to part ways on mutual consent. \n\nFast forward to now, I am unemployed with my pregnant partner. I have about a month or 2 tops savings. If I can\u2019t find a job within that time, I will need to head back to my family (if they accept me that is).\n\nTherefore, I feel like I let myself down, my partner down and will ultimately be ridiculed by my family when I will eventually be forced to go back to them. I just don\u2019t know why I always mess things up! ;(",

            "comment": "Why \"part ways on mutual consent\"? If I leave a job it's because I quit or get fired. Nothing mutual about it. Did you have an opportunity to improve your performance? Usually if you aren't doing a good job there's some time where you can reasonably try to turn it around before being fired. If salvaging that job isn't an option then are there other similar jobs around?\n\nWhy would your fam be so opposed to you making a positive change in your life? That sucks.",

I go to the gym, but I don't achieve the results I want to.\n\nI get the best haircut possible but I still don't like how it looks.\n\nI put incredible amount of effort, time and money into fixing my wardrobe but still I look only slightly better or less worse.\n\nI've changed my diet, my routines, I started reading more, I started studying more, I started working out more than I possibly can.\n\nStill the progress is little to none. I feel like a polished turd.\n\nI simply have horrible facial structure, teeth and my body looks funny (tall with long skinny arms, skinny calves and long legs).\n\nI work on all of it for years but nothing seems to be getting better so I can like it.\n\nThe more I look at myself in the mirror, the more I hate myself. It's becoming hard to go to the gym, to keep the routine because I feel like it's pointless.\n\nI simply cannot like myself. I try not to compare myself with others. I just want to find a way to like myself. But it's impossible, especially when no one has ever liked me. No one ever compliments me.\n\nI believe that in such case to like myself will not be real, it will be a delusion.\n\nI don't want to be delusional.\n\nI want to be able to like myself for real. But I'm running out of things to try to improve myself. It just seems that no matter what I do, I am not destined to look good.",

Or trying to get there?\u201d\n- Everything happens FOR you, not TO you. \n\n\nThe book is well worth a pass. Full of actionable prompts and good questions.",

And why is your physical look so important to you? What are you missing from your life that you expect to have if you were good looking?\n\nI'm not saying I know your struggles and story, but I would say that you need to continue putting the same effort in your physical health, and you must start putting the effort into getting to know yourself. Unfortunately some things you cannot change, but you need to learn to accept them and try to focus on improving the things you can change. There is a great book that helped me overcome some of the things I didn't like about myself, it's called \"Love yourself like your life depends on it\" by Kamal Ravikant. I think you could benefit a lot from reading it, so please give it a try, and don't stop putting effort into improving your current situation. Stay strong my friend!",

I would also say that any successful man is going to attract women. By successful I mean being fit, ambitious and financially independent. Women will come, you focus on your self.  \nIf you don't feel comfortable with your current situation, why would anyone else think otherwise? \n\nYou have the power of changing yourself. Once you accomplish certain things you think are important for you, you will start appreciating yourself more, which will result into more confidence and self esteem. Once you are done with that, you will glow anywhere you show up, and that will attract women.",

            "comment": "It's important to remember that self-improvement and self-acceptance are two separate things. While self-improvement can help you feel more confident and accomplished, it doesn't necessarily guarantee self-acceptance or self-love.\n\nIf you're struggling to like yourself despite making efforts to improve, it may be helpful to explore the underlying reasons for your negative self-image. This could involve working with a therapist or counselor to identify and address negative thought patterns or experiences that may be contributing to your feelings of self-doubt or self-criticism.\n\nIt's also important to practice self-compassion and self-care, even if you don't feel like you deserve it. This could involve taking time to engage in activities that bring you joy, setting boundaries with others, and challenging negative self-talk with positive affirmations or self-compassionate statements.\n\nRemember that self-acceptance is a journey, and it's okay to seek support and guidance along the way. Be patient and kind with yourself, and celebrate small victories as you work toward a more positive self-image.",

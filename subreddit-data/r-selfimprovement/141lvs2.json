It's going well but I wanna scale it and lack the drive to do so.\r  \n\r  \n**My plan:**\r  \n\r  \n\\- be online on Discord at the same time with each other everyday for 2 hours straight, no voice or video, just text messaging.\r  \n\r  \n\\- after the 2 hours we chat a bit about what we did, how we are feeling, what are our plans for the upcoming days and so on and so forth.\r  \n\r  \n\\- set achievable goals for each week and hold each other accountable for them.\r  \n\r  \n**Our partnership**\n\nI'll be very happy to listen about your goals and actually hold you accountable for whatever promises you make.\r  \n\r  \nI will treat your goals as my own. I will do my best to ensure both of us get our goals achieved!   \n\r  \n\r  \nWhether you are studying or working, please feel free to send a message! I would like to talk a bit before starting to see if we are compatible with each other. :)\r  \n\r  \nMy schedule is very flexible since my inner sleep clock is permanently wrecked beyond repair.\r  \n\r\r  \n\r  \nThanks!",

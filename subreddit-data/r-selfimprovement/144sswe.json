    "postText": "I don't know why I decided to but I went on Facebook and looked up his name, after two years.\nI was in a relationship with him for 5 months, he gaslit, abused, and manipulated me. I was 14 at the time and now I'm 16 and it's still affecting me. He was one of the reasons I was admitted into the mental hospital. I missed him at first but all the bad things he did started flooding back to me. I don't know why I can't get over something that happened two years ago. He's the one who left, not me. I'm just angry because he looks like he's truly enjoying life and I'm pretty sure he has a new girlfriend. I'm just wondering why I was the one who had to suffer for months on end because of him. I cried and was so broken for months and months and he just moved on with his life. Why does he get to be happy and I don't? How do I move on. I don't miss him anymore I'm just angry and afraid. I've puked multiple times today after seeing him on Facebook. im so scared of him and thinking about it is making me feel uneasy",

Sooner than you think you\u2019ll get over him. Just focus on yourself, learn from the experience but let the resentment go. It doesn\u2019t matter if you were right if you let him continue to bring you down.",

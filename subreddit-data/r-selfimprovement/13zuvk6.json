Looking to do a career change and land a job in Tech or become more self-sufficient and be able to freelance for myself financially. \n\nI live in San Francisco so I might as well take advantage of the office space here. \n\nAny tips to a young man? No kids, No spouse, just free time. Any advice you would love told yourself going down this path? Or any career change?",

You won't see the finish line if you don't stick through it, break through the self-doubt, the lack of skill, and the slow coding speed. Those things change with time, but your determination will make you last that length of time. \n\nYou deserve this, you've got this, now just step into it and take it.",

It\u2019s like a lightbulb as turned on over my head. I feel as if I can move up in the industry quick as well running my own clothing brand and using that website as my project I build, where I sell the clothes I already screen-print. \n\nPlus, working from home would be great in SF. Just go to the park or a cafe or nice high rise",

I\u2019m mad because I waited so long, and looking at HTML, it\u2019s just like looking at MySpace and it\u2019s clicking a bit. Honestly I need a career change, I\u2019ve worked about 100jobs in the past few years and none have stuck. I thank you so much",

    "postText": "If you look at the post history on this account, you\u2019ll pretty quickly see the motive behind this question.\n\nI just got out of my third serious relationship (one former relationship and one marriage). This time, I had the courage to leave a partner that was emotionally abusive, as her actions and personality at most turns affected how I socialized with people, viewed my own actions and how I approached my future (very much focused on her wants rather than my needs). \n\nWhat I\u2019ve come to realize is that a lot of my problem stems from the same problem\u2014in my family, I had a terrible relationship with my father with much older siblings who had the means to leave. In short, he was a judgmental, unemployed drunk and my mother and I were the easy targets. My mother played the classic \u201cbattered wife\u201d role, for which I\u2019ve come to realize was something very much out of her control. We have an amazing relationship now. My dad and I have a tolerable relationship since I became independent. My dad vicariously lived through me, pushing me on the path that he wanted (and luckily, I actually know in my heart I want too after years of soul-searching). \n\nWhat it came down to was that his love always felt conditional, contingent on some milestone\u2014having certain grades, performing to a certain level in sports and extracurriculars, putting blinders on to any distraction that could hinder them\u2014most often, the women I brought into my life.\n\nWhat I looked for in a woman was the \u201canti-dad\u201d, someone who loved me for me. Someone who cared about me outside my career and status aspirations. Someone who saw me as innately lovable. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve come to realize after this last break-up, is that I have taken on the same \u201ctype of love\u201d, but under a different form. What before was \u201cbe the person I want you to be and I will love and praise you\u201d (i.e.-become a successful doctor), became the same thing except without the lofty career aspiration aspect. It became \u201cbe the exact person I want you to be for me and I\u2019ll show you the shreds of affection you crave\u201d. \n\nI realize that I have a terrible relationship with those I love or befriend, but also an awful relationship with myself. At the risk of sounding dramatic, it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known well in my interpersonal relationships. I think it\u2019s fundamentally the problem I have to deal with in order to have better relationships with people and myself moving forward. \n\nI\u2019ve heard of attachment theory. My therapist says I have the anxious-ambivalent style, and that ultimately the easiest (and only) ways to have a secure style is to put yourself in situations where you surround yourself with those types of people so that you learn those behavior over time. That and of course, self-awareness. \n\nAll I know is that part of the reason it\u2019s been so hard for me to move on is because I know I\u2019m going to be alone again. Before you say codependency, what\u2019s weird is that I generally pretty self-sufficient and when I independently put my mind to things, I\u2019m generally successful. It\u2019s usually only when I\u2019m in a relationship that things fall apart so catastrophically. Every time I\u2019ve had a breakup or split, I\u2019ve lost a job or I\u2019m at a crossroads in my life. It\u2019s never just been a clean break with two healthy individuals acknowledging that things just weren\u2019t a good fit. Another weird commonality is that alll three relationships involved outgoing, happy and upbeat women pursuing me. They\u2019re always very social and on the surface seem well put-together. I\u2019ve also noticed the relationships tend to spark very fast. In 2/3 of the cases, we lived in very close proximity to each other (same floor or apartment complex) and things escalated quickly.\n\nWhat I and everyone wants is to have healthy, meaningful relationships buttressed by a good network of friends, goals and hobbies. \n\nIf you\u2019ve been here in your life, how did you address this pattern? Thanks for reading and your help!",

My question isn\u2019t about efficiency or whether something is rewarding. \n\nPlainly, I\u2019m asking people who have endured similar relationships with themselves and others how they overcame those dynamics and got to healthier states overall.",

Why can't you answer?\n\nTo address your plain concerns, did you recognize the blueprint of your father's relationship, that you see love and relationships as harmful? \n\nCBT from professional experts will address your false assumptions, and you can be your own advocate to unlearn your harmful fantasies.",

                                    "comment": "Thanks for your response. \n\nTo the first question: I think a healthy amount of that is good for anyone. Ideally, the ultimate end is ourselves, first, but striving to find meaning outside of that, i.e.-in our personal relationships, careers, some outside mission, is perfectly acceptable. It definitely shouldn\u2019t be your primary focus, yourself should be. \n\nTo the second question: I don\u2019t mean to come across as combative by my last response. I was simply commenting to the relevance of the concepts of efficiency and reward. I see now that you\u2019re referring to life as an entire entity, not the single facet of interpersonal relationships. In that vein, I certainly don\u2019t believe life and the relationships that populate it need to be efficient. I believe partially in the second, that relationships should ultimately be rewarding insofar as they mutually reinforce the participants\u2019 continued growth and appreciation for each other. It should be rewarding in that it gives the participants an incentive to stay, otherwise, why stay? However, the \u201creward\u201d I\u2019ve reaped from these relationships is experience and a lot of pain, pain that I\u2019m tired of having. I\u2019m getting older and nearing a point in my life where I\u2019d like to have healthier relationships with people I meet and better boundaries for myself.\n\nTo the third point: That is very interesting. I\u2019ve considered the blueprint of the father-son relationship  as iterative to my past relationships. I have to ask, what do you mean by seeing relationships as harmful?\n\nTo the fourth point: I\u2019ve heard of and engaged in CBT before. I currently see a professional and am beginning yet again to work through these things. What do you mean by \u201cfalse assumptions\u201d and harmful fantasies\u201d? It seems you have picked up on something I\u2019ve said that I\u2019m missing. Can you elaborate? \n\nThanks for your response!",

If it does, there won't be a situation you can't come out of. \n\nBad punctuation, I was asking if you see the relationship blueprint that you created because of your relationships, as harmful.\n\nDoesn't look helpful for you on the wall as I see it.\n\n&gt; For instance, someone may have the assumption that \"I must be perfect at everything I do or I am a failure.\" This type of thinking can lead to intense pressure, anxiety, and feelings of inadequacy. In CBT, a therapist would work with the individual to challenge and modify this assumption, perhaps helping them to see that it is not only unrealistic, but also unhelpful.\n\nThat's what I would mean about unrealistic unhelpful harmful fantasies. \n\nExperts are there for us when we pay them for their sometimes lifelong dedication to challenge you, but you can absolutely be your own advocate to take a more realistic approach to life.",

    "postText": "About to choose a career path. Should I get a Bachelor's in Filmmaking or should I go for something safer, less exciting to me and far more stable, and never take the risk to pursue what I love most? What would your advice be and why? Been feeling pressured to make a 'rational decision' but tbh romanticizing the vision I have for my dream future a little too much to give up on it. Anyhow, interested to hear your thoughts and open to different perspectives.\n\nEdit: Thanks so much to everyone who shared your thoughts!",

Personally I like my creature comforts and extra money to enjoy life, so I would say you should do both. Get a good paying stable job so that you can also pursue filmmaking on the side or after early retirement.\n\nEdit: what is the risk exactly? If you major in filmmaking, can you also get jobs related to commercials and media? Also why not find a stable job you also enjoy?",

Anything less and you wind up feeling like you're not fulfilling your calling in life which creates an empty feeling inside.",

If you can\u2019t get a job in film, maybe you\u2019ll stumble into something else. Failure is a part of life, remember - you have the power to define what success means to you and that definition will change as you grow. If you want to pivot for any reason- financial security, you just changed your mind- that\u2019s fine, you can do that too. Being young and full of dreams is a very special moment in life, I feel you should embrace it 1000%. (A little about me- I\u2019m a film editor now, went to film school - school didn\u2019t really steer me there, eventually met ppl that led me to editing. I worked a lot of service industry jobs alongside unpaid internships while living at home for a long time. Yes, it is very stressful and hard to live with little money, but I look back on that time with great fondness for the potential energy of my youth then- internally I was an emotional mess, but something about it will always be one of the most special times of my life.) Good luck to you.",

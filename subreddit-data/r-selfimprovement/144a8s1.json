    "postText": "So, I have a problem where my performance differs wildly between good days and bad days. This is not limited to a specific activity. It could be driving, video games, disc golf, social interaction etc. I know it\u2019s normal with some variation in how good you are at something, but I feel like there\u2019s usually a smaller gap. It\u2019s really annoying and sometimes it makes me very upset. Also, once something has begun to go poorly, it always leads me to make more mistakes. For some reason, I can\u2019t save it. Perhaps it will go better the next time, but it\u2019s very very rare that I manage to improve on the same occasion. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s big enough to be a diagnosis or anything, but clearly it is  some sort of mental thing. I don\u2019t know how to improve on this, and would be very grateful for suggestions.",

Break down your big goals into smaller tasks, and tackle them one step at a time. And here's a cool app called Forfeit that can help you stay motivated. It's a cool tool that holds you accountable by making you send evidence of completing tasks or you lose some money. Give it a shot and see if it helps you stay on track. Remember, progress takes time, so be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward!",

    "postText": "Express love and gratitude to your parents while you still can. The pain of regret and loss is deep and long-lasting.\n\nDon't base your self-worth on sexual conquests. It is an empty and unsustainable pursuit. Find purpose and meaning in life and work towards it.\n\nConsider alternatives to traditional college education. It may not be the best fit for everyone. Self-education can be equally effective in achieving success.\n\nAvoid pornography, which can be addictive and draining on your brain and energy.\n\nPractice self-reflection and learn to enjoy your own company. This will prevent you from getting into toxic relationships due to fear of being alone.\n\nIncorporate weightlifting into your routine to experience a transformation in your confidence, discipline, and happiness.\n\nTake care of your appearance, as it can significantly impact your confidence in various aspects of life.\n\nDelay getting married until you have a better understanding of yourself and the other person. Rushing into marriage can lead to negative outcomes.",

I'll accept that you are generally agreeing that removing yourself from an abusive situation is a good thing. We can also generally agree that that could have a time period related to it, right? I say that because in your next statement you suggest that cutting ties is something different, and we can take the implied position here that you generally think that's wrong, based on your religion and sense of duty you mention elsewhere.\n\nI'd argue that you're still wrong.\n\nLet me put this hypothetical situation to you. A parent sexually abuses their child. Also physically abuses that child with beatings. And for good measure they also emotionally and verbally abuse that child. The parent shows no remorse and no signs of changing their behaviour. This child was born from an unwanted pregnancy. \n\nDoes your religion tell you that this child must not cut ties and still has a duty to their parent? If you answer yes, then I'd challenge you to really think about whether that religious teaching, guidance or interpretation is healthy. \n\nIf you answer no, then I think you can recognize that extreme circumstances exist and your first response declaring what people must never do was wrong on its merits. \n\nAnd beyond this, you should probably reflect on your position given the generally disapproving feedback your answers have elicited from this little pocket of society in this sub. \n\nFinally, I care very much about religion and the incredible harm that many of its most ardent supporters and practitioners have inflicted on society over the course of our history. And it seems to be happening still.",

My religion teaches me that the parents should be warned, advised and if still persistent in their actions, should face severe punishment that can set an example in society.\n\nTheir great criminality, however, does not mean they lose their right to kind treatment and upholding the ties of kinship from their children, so long as there is no danger of falling into any evil actions.\n\nIt's healthy because it forces you to be good to people even when they have wronged you, while not dismissing their criminality and in fact bringing justice to the abused. That's the ultimate demonstration and force of manifestation of self-improvement. It's very difficult, and that's why it's gonna make you even better when you're able to see past it.",

I admit, that does still make me smile sometimes.\nI advise you to find a way to twist the pain and/or anger towards growth. As others have said, the best revenge is a life well lived. That works wonders, because it\u2019s true.\nI advise you to be forgiving if there\u2019s ups and downs and to expect and be prepared for all stages of grief in any order. There\u2019s one where you\u2019re angry. I loved that one. It\u2019s like rocket fuel mixed with cocaine.

After my last relationship I tried to go back to the hookup culture and it just felt empty. I didn't feel anything for the two people I hooked up with after, and it didn't do anything for me. I've never experienced that and I didn't like it at all. I wouldn't say never try casual sex, but after a few times it starts to feel worse. It's different for everyone though.

I especially like the point of compassion not being the opposite of anger.\nHowever, it\u2019s hard to explain my problems with anger. I don\u2019t mean not being able to get wild, shouting fits, no, I mean just thinking in every possible situation \u201cthey probably didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d Thinking the best of people, because I just don\u2019t have any angry feelings to drive me away from that. Sometimes people aren\u2019t the best. Setting boundaries always requires some capacity of being upset about something. That can be an unhealthy amount, but there is such a thing as a healthy and even necessary amount of anger to make you even think twice about things that happen and make you speak out and say \u201cthis is not right. I don\u2019t want you to do that again.\u201d\n\nNow actually getting outwardly angry is a whole different thing, but that still applies. There are people who don\u2019t react to reasonable discussion of boundaries. I have family members like that. Pointing out things they did wrong brings out a fury like you\u2019ve just murdered their child, just so they can nuclearly dismiss your criticism. They only listen slightly if you get outwardly angry.\n\nExample: My mother is a bully. Not so much to me (I have a brother for that), but more so to my father. He\u2019s the same as me, and just doesn\u2019t react easily, but after a while, enough anger comes out to make him say things like, \u201ccould you please stop that, it\u2019s really not okay.\u201d She just refuses to hear he even said that. Recently I of all people had to step in and raise my voice at her when she said she was trying to \u201ceducate\u201d him. He should get angry. He should get furious. The situation would have been much better if they\u2019d fought more, because now it\u2019s too late and she\u2019ll never take him seriously anymore, because he just doesn\u2019t get angry.\nYou know who my mother does listen to? My brother, the also bully. He gets angry, overly so. He\u2019s doing it even more wrong than my dad, but they\u2019d do well if they\u2019d meet in the middle.\n\nAnger has a reason, all emotions do. We just don\u2019t always use them at the right time.\nI sincerely believe that even being pushed to set a boundary when something happens you\u2019re not okay with requires a small amount of anger. You don\u2019t see it when you have it, but I\u2019ve noticed getting it sometimes after some things happened to me recently. That\u2019s why I\u2019m pointing this out.",

You should not feel depressed or set your own self-worth into having extremities or not!\".Why cannot we say the same about being a rich person, going so easily and coming from success to tell other poor people: \"Hey! you should feel grateful for being alive and for what you have. You should not strive for having a lot of luxuries, easy time and great life experiences, but you should be grateful with what you have and set your value on other things than money! Besides I never had lack of basic needs and had great awesome experiences in life with money (Sex-love-relationships in this analogy).\".\n\n&gt;Avoid pornography, which can be addictive and draining on your brain and energy.\n\nI consumed porn late in life from like 17 until 25 years old. I never got to masturbate because of it, just because wanted to feel more connected with the typical trend that school peers and from what I heard, men overall do since the start of this century. I always felt empty watching it, but also because I wanted to ever feel a little bit what means to be desired &amp; loved by another woman, even if it was through porn.... I mean, I do not encourage porn because to an extent is worthless and draining because, I understand many lonely men out there that DO CONSUME this content but not specifically (and most likely) because a biological need, but also because THEY DO FEEL LONELY AND WANT FEMENINE VALIDATION/TOUCHING. So the conclusion is then, why would you suggest to those lonely men to not consume this stuff if they simply cannot find female love in life ? How do you think someone can satisfy this never satisfied necessity - desire that most of women out there can do so ?\n\n&gt;Practice self-reflection and learn to enjoy your own company\n\nHow can somebody (specially a male) can ever know (and love) to feel good being lonely if never had a single chance to know what love feels like ? I mean, you can do this if you already have the experience in life. But many dudes I see asking advice either here or out there that never had a relationship or sex, strive to know what ever feels like just as me. This is hypocrisy to an extent as well and does not help if you already had this beautiful like experience as well... Just like the first paragraph, but it's easy to give such advices when you come up from the position of success, abudance or privilege.",

Otherwise there\u2019s just no need to rush into a legally binding relationship with someone. \n\nSo if you\u2019re in that position, really ask yourself why you\u2019re in such a rush? What does getting married bring you that you don\u2019t get from a long term engagement?",

Understand that porn is a fantasy 9 times out of 10. You are more than a sex driven monkey, act like it.\n\nIf you can understand that not everything you watch on TV is reality but can't make that jump in porn then that's a totally different issue than a porn specific thing.\n\nEdit: before you downvote, maybe read the full thread and watch me destroy these idiotic responses. Better yet, if you downvote, name me a place in the world that banned porn and then tell me how it's going for everyone.",

If you can separate television from reality you should be fine (most people). I don't understand why you and others think substance use disorder is the same as an inability to distinguish acting from reality but here we are, these are not hard concepts to understand. \n\nLet's go down your weird comparison of a vague \"addiction\" connection though. I understand that some people cannot watch porn in a healthy manner. Those individuals have an unhealthy relationship with sex just like how an alcoholic has an unhealthy relationship with substance use. The term unhealthy in this sense means they cannot control their urges or distinguish porn from reality or as you inaccurately observed \"porn destroys people's views of relationships\". That's not because of porn, plenty of people watch porn and are fine. It's because of the individual's inability to have a healthy relationship with porn, not the porn itself.\n\nThe OP outright said \"stay away from porn\". This, to me, sounds like a person with an unhealthy relationship with sex. Sure lots of 20 something's have that issue. Hormones and all. This is the time they are supposed to learn to have a healthy relationship with sex. This is the time to understand porn and how it fits into society and people's lives. Telling people that porn is wrong just adds stigma to sex and hurts a society as a whole.\n\nHonestly telling someone at 20 that porn is not an accurate representation of sex or a relationship is too late. That person needs professional help or a very understanding partner and an open mind.",

I don't think the problem is that people can't distinguish porn from reality. I think the main problem, is that most porn is just too over the top.

The more you watch porn, the more you want to find something new, that stimulates you and gives you the dopamine boost you desire..This can have a bad impact on the way you view women, on your actual sexlife and could lead to a serious addiction for some people.\n\n\n\nIdk what your on about tbh.

First off, you're failing that ideal already by giving in to temptations of lazy thinking by talking on an internet forums about shit that matters to no one. At least have consistency in your argument.\n\nYou think Goggins a good role model here? A man who has completely thrown everything to the way side to dedicate his life to the sole idea of being an amazing endurance athlete. An arguably one dimensional but still incredibly interesting model of mankind. A choice for again, a redditor arguing away on an old post no one will read.

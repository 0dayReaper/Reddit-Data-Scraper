Go outside.\n\n\u2018forget' to bring your earbuds. \n\nWalk for 30 mins outside. Your mind will start wandering without music and podcast. You start rethinking your life, re-evaluating your past choices, making new goals, etc. It's a good alternative to meditating AND you get a good 30 mins exercise out of it!",

The practice of meditation is not about sitting still but about being in the moment. Being in the moment means not being stuck in your head, not being lost in thoughts like you might be the rest of the time.\n\nAnd if you can spend even a minute being mostly present, mostly free of thoughts, just focusing on your breathing and observing whatever goes through your head, you will get a lot more out of that than you would from walking around for hours each day being completely lost in thought.",

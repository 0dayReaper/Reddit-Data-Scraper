    "postText": "I (28M) grew up with parents that made me do things in my life to earn their approval. Recently moved out and have had very limited contact with them. Spent my life thinking I have to do things for others to validate my worth as a person. Now that I\u2019ve gotten used to living my own life, I\u2019m done doing that shit. If friends have problems then they need to reach out to me. I can finally pursue my own hobbies. Friends have annoyed me so much lately because I haven\u2019t been checking in with them as much as I used to so now I\u2019m the bad guy.  Like I just don\u2019t care anymore about making people happy except for myself!",

Guess who is the bad guy now. There is a difference between humans and people.",

    "postText": "Cold approaching pick up is one of, if not the best skills I have ever learned , I am freshly out of a 4 year relationship and got back into cold approaching women, let me tell you the results have been fantastic.\n\nI am 32 yo, 5'7, in shape and more than average looking face wise.\n\nIn parallel I have tinder gold running with some decent photos , I get a few ok matches but it's hard and especially boring to get an actual date.\n\nOn the other hand with cold approaching I am able to get instant dates with women I am definitely attracted to, having fun in the process and some of these dates can sometimes lead to sex the same day (not that frequent but yes it happens). \n\nOtherwise I am getting numbers and able to convert a decent amount of these into actual dates.\n\nThe calibre/volume of women I am able to date through cold approach is way higher than I ever experienced with apps, social circles or clubs.\n\nLet me know if I can help with any questions :)",

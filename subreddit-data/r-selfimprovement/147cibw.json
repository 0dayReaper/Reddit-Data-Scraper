    "postText": "I think I'm ugly.\n\nI've always thought I was ugly even as a kid. It just got worse as I got older because I thought I'd grow out of it. I'd have a few times where I break out of it (going to the gym, wearing contacts, getting different haircuts, etc.)\n\nBut its only so temporary. I still get rejected. I'm still a skinny big headed nerd with gaps in his teeth (and I have bad credit so that'll take a minute to fully fix). \n\nI still look awkward in photos and am an awkward person overall. The people around me tend to like my company. I'm sure I'd be missed of I were gone but that's not enough.\n\nI don't know how to get over feeling like this. Therapy only helps a little in regards to this. I don't know if there's a concrete answer.",

            "comment": "All I've been able to do to stop feeling ugly is just ask myself why I feel that way and look at pictures of myself seeing what I need to improve on and just trying my best to improve them. So far, I can stand to look at myself in pictures a lot more than I used to by just losing a little bit of weight and consistently getting haircuts. I still feel the same way overall, but it will take a lot of time and effort",

He goes to a parallel world where everybody is gorgeous. He suffers a lot in the begining, but ends up being a good translator, so he can do things others strugle to do... Long story short, Beauty does not buy happiness. There are other things more valuable in life. Good Luck.",

And I tried to mimic that aesthetic. Then I realized that girls grow out of that and desire masculinity. The masculine look is more rough around the edges so its more forgiving face wise. In fact, if you got any bold features or scars on your face its even better. It does require some dedication at the gym though, that's the caveat.",

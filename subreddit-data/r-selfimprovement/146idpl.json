    "postText": "I will try to put this as short as possible but with enough details so that you guys can understand.\n\nMy girlfriend and I started dating 6 years ago, we hooked up on our first date and are together ever since.\nA first serious relationship for both of us.\n\nIn the first couple of years it was interesting,we had our ups and downs but as does any healthy relationship and we always managed to work over anything.\n\nShe met me with her friend group who are now one of my favourite people, as well as the new friends we met together.\n\nAnd in those first few years we lived separately and couldn't wait to see eachother again after each hang out\nDuring that time i started my uni and she was finishing her masters degree, both of us were also working.\nWe went on vacations and events togerher, both just us and with our friend groups. We all became somewhat of a family.\n\nThen COVID happened. \n\nI was fit prior to it and gained some weight during it, not so much but enough for me to be unhappy with it, I'm also 6'4''  and a pretty dude so that helps with hiding the excess weight. \nThen I've got depressed, i cannot quite recall when it happened but i can guess that my life just caught up with me(really hard and heavy childhood/teenage years) so it just hit me out of the blue.\n\nAfter the lockdown passed, I've moved in with her, she has her own apartment so we aren't renting. \nAnd for the first time in my life I'm having money to  buy myself anything I've wanted(both our jobs are high paying)\nThought we do not have a shared budget, we both give required equal into the house and spend the rest of our money on what we wish or what we both want.\n\nI've started failing my uni and started focusing more on my corporate career, which didn't help with my lack of discipline and will to do anything\n\nAfter some time living together, things changed.\nEverything I do i barely manage to force myself to do it, everything i love i started loosing interest in it and it stopped bringing any pleasure or joy.\nI just spend the free time i have doing menial things like playing games or paint minis just to pass time and cope with it.\n\nSomewhere during this period our relationship also started to crumble at least from my perspective. \nWe stopped having things to talk about, our taste in stuff changed as well. We started to be less and less intimate because she is never in the mood and every time i try and engage i feel like shit who wishes to use her and stop. \nI'm thinking I stopped being attractive to her. We're more like roommates and very good friends than partners.\nWe haven't had any intimacy i almost half a year and in that lack of intimate relationship attention which we had before, I started to notice other people... I began to make scenarios in my head... Thinking what could've been if I've made my choices differently.\nI still feel for her and think she's an amazing person but Its hard for me to imagine a life with a roommate and not a partner.\n\nShould I try and finally speak about how i feel regarding everything because every time i tried before she got defensive and i just went with nevermind. Should we break up even thought we share same friends and that I may end up losing them considering they're hers originally?\n\n\nTLDR. 6 year old relationship is dying/dead. We have the same friend groups, living together. Should I break it or stay?\n\nThanks to anyone who reads whatever I've wrote in 5am and to anyone who gives an opinion.",

            "comment": "I understand how you feel, it's hard still liking the person but not feeling the love anymore. I would say it's time to have a conversation with her. If you truly aren't happy and have no want to be with her, then it is the best choice for the both of you. Since it's your first serious relationship it will really suck breaking up (it never gets easier, really), but that's completely normal and you will feel better after some time. Don't expect to remain friends with the people you met through her, maybe get some hobbies to meet new people and take your mind off of things. Also, now would be a good time to start going to the gym/focusing on your fitness again, you got this!",

There's this image that you have to work hard, have a perfect plan and self confidence in your endeavors by some magic young adult age to get the desirable status, any latency is somehow extremely detrimental.\n\nOn the contrary you are still psychosocially, morally, emotionally and cognitively developing at these ages. For the vast majority of people this is the age you should be learning about yourself and the world in a responsible, aware and self driven sense, at the same time it's also the period where you should be aiming to introspect some of the errors that maybe happened in earlier years, most of us didn't have perfect upbringings, and often we have some flaws which demand some of our own agency to be a better person. If success is your goal, that period should be about priming yourself for success, not just pursuing success itself.\n\nI see sooooo many people caught up in this idea that it's \"too late\" and they just stagnate, they resign, they reinforce the idea in their mind. As the pressures of living costs, the pressures of qualification and professionalism rise, the competitive hierarchies which shape our society, the lower the bar for perceptions of \"too late\".",

It's also so situational, I saw a post about a real estate biz at 20, after digging through their pages I found both parents are very accomplished biz owners (I'd be surprised if they weren't millionaire's) so having that safety net, mentorship, and opportunity is an anomaly many don't see and compare themselves to.\n\nThere's a difference of \"Hey young gun, I did this at my age don't let it your age be a mental road block, you can do it\" vs the \"I'm 17yr have 6 ferraris, 2 mansions and 7 drop shipping sites that make more than Walmart\" like stfu.",

The most motivating goals are ones which exist in the department of realistic but challenging, you don't want dauntingly hard, and you don't want easy. \n\nThe problem with condensing big achievements in a short period of time, is that it forces it into the daunting department. If the time scale for \"I want to make lots of money\" is 10 years, then that's 10 years you have to split the large goal into progressive smaller realistic but challenging goals, whereas in 2 years it essentially becomes one singular goal of massive proportion. \n\nI think what people often also miss in the sensationalisation is how people got where they are, a lot of people are primed with generational wealth, but for the more normal folks, time is key, you don't have to work \"hard\" per se but you have to work towards something consistently, studiously, and make room for failure, as that's the part of the experiment where you learn what doesn't work.",

If all your seeing is Andrew Tate talking about \"bitches\" and getting pussy and you don't have strong convictions on these things then your going to pretty damn warped by it. Why can't I escape these videos ffs, maybe I'll watch the occasional Joe Rogan thing talking to a scientist but I don't want all this other shite that seems to be in the same bracket!",

So there's this perception that settling with someone who is average or not super attractive, is conceding to yourself that you are of subpar value. To the younger, more egoistic individual that can be a hard concept to come to terms with, combine that with some *questionable* characters spewing nonsense to feed their developing adult mind and you have a recipe for questionable beliefs.\n\nNow there's a much more philosophical conversation in there, what makes something valuable is it extrinsic or intrinsic? etc. Not that I ever see anyone go there.\n\nHowever I think there's some things which get perpetuated on a wider level, number one is I don't think it's really okay to look at the people attached to you as an extension of your own merit or self, viewing woman like that is just odd, it's almost a bit objectifying, kind of looking at it like a car \"Well I need to get more money so I can get the better looking one to show off my status\".\n\nAt the same time, we have a loneliness epidemic, and there's tons of people that don't even look for the most \"attractive\" women, they are just failing in the relationship scene, for many different reasons and for a lot of people, relationships can be some of the most important facets of their lives. I think this is another primer for questionable beliefs, vulnerability-stress model if you will, but I think it's also not worth dismissing such woes, especially not in self improvement, because the answer can be something very general like hygiene, or being a better conversationalist, tackling these before they go on their introjection tirade is key. I don't see how this would not be self improvement.",

Social media makes all our childhood mistakes look 10x worse, but also exposes kids to stuff they maybe shouldn't be exposed to, like this incel bullshit.\n\nI always try to post to these kids that dating and growing up is not something you instantly know how to do. The first thing to do when having trouble with the opposite sex is to look at your own behavior. How are you approaching women? How's your hygiene? Bathing is necessary, especially when going through puberty. \n\nWomen are just as different as men. We're not all of one mind. I have never dated a man with visible abs. I'm 41/f. I go for men who make me laugh, are responsible, and genuinely good people who get to know me. Plus brains and self respect. Really!\n\nThis is the god honest truth, but I would never be with someone like Andrew Tate, even if he does have money or whatever. He's not *my* type. He's not the type of a lot of women, and that's totally normal. Certainly some women love him, and that's great for them. But I'm not them. You are not Andrew Tate, you are your own individual person with your own pluses and minuses that you shape over a lifetime. Figure out who you are. There's certainly nothing wrong with emulating someone else, but make sure to emulate someone who is a good human being. \n\nBecause even if you're getting women left and right as a devotee of Tate, are you actually getting what YOU WANT? Those are the peeple who will use you for your money, your body, or who you know. If they're not seeing you as someone worthy of staying with, they'll never stay. And you'll still be alone.",

Instead of looking down on these people, look at them as people who are lost, out of options and sending a signal flair into the internet for help. As a teacher working with this generation, the majority of these kids are completely lost. They have no idea how the real world works and need serious guidance, especially from successful males who have been mostly absent from their lives. Shitting on these people doesn\u2019t help anyone. Try and be more empathetic to others situations who don\u2019t have the examples or mentorship to find a solution on their own.",

Obviously, being disrespectful and unfair towards women like these incels do is unacceptable and I do not support it at all. Also obviously, the whole incel community and their collective sense of blame to women is a projection of how they are viewing themselves so we can get that out of the way. Other than the incels, some of these people are genuinely lonely and have self worth issues not relating to involuntary celibacy and they need help. They think they are unworthy of love which is not true. I agree with the frustration, but their position is hard.",

They tried *too hard* to be what others wanted them to be.\n\nBut if you listen to the poison that men listen to today \"try to be delicate and don't harm\" too often, it will make you paralyzed from taking action. Eventually it will make you like being harmless.\n\nBut the thing is, men just cannot be harmless, or they will take no action. And that behaviour just isn't attractive.\n\nThen as they let that poison turn their thoughts into negative ones, something inside them tells them \"this can't go on.\"\n\nSo they start listening to even more advice, now mostly from ones that tell them how to take action.\n\nBut since they are now operating from a really poisoned mindset, everything they do when they take action is a wrong action.\n\nSo they get a negative feedback from even that. This keeps confusing them, and they just don't know what they are supposed to do anymore.\n\nThey then start thinking that \"maybe it's not my fault, maybe it's them that are the problem, why the hell are they so difficult.\"\n\nAaand so it goes. Now they don't care about your advice, because they believe you are the problem.\n\n...\n\nWhat they should do is unlearn all their learned behaviour, and start listening to their own instincts.\n\nThen they should start building on top of those instincts with *their own* experience. No outside advice. Zero. It's all confusion.\n\nAttraction is not supposed to be that complicated. If it was, we would go extinct long ago.\n\n...\n\nTalking from my experience as I had internalized hate against women and then did my best to unlearn all that noise.\n\nI still have long ways to go though.

You can say incel ideology but it wouldnt stick if dudes didnt relate to it and so many dudes wouldnt be dedicated to believing it if they werent seeing proof of it in their lives. I think the internet made it extremely hard to meet women unless you are stupidly attractive and then any way to meet women traditionally irl was killed or made extremely difficult unless you are super sociable and in college or something. Then mainstream media and social media started painting guys having any attraction to women as evil, disgusting, and creepy, and that women want them to not exist, women do not want guys to talk to them ever. In fact, there was a recent thread on askreddit, a very large thread, asking what women would do if men didnt exist for 24 hours and you can see how so many of them responded they would see it as a positive and live happy for those 24 hours. Just to give you an idea of how gender relations are going. I dont believe this is feminism, i think this is just how women naturally think, they just naturally fear men which turns to hate. Only time it doesnt is if the guy is stupid attractive.\n\nI see this in real life, most men i know are single tell they hit like 30 or so and even then its not written in stone. That is not normal. That is the sign of an extremely stressed society. This isnt going to end well for anyone if this starts becoming the norm. You will absolutely see a rise in political extremism because military aged men are not going to sit and waste their lives pencil pushing and flipping burgers. Many are gonna look around and see they have nothing to live for and join something to change that. I think the internet failed a lot of people. We would be better as a society without it.",

They\u2019re able to have a husband or boyfriend as just an extension of their happiness. We weren\u2019t allowed to have credit cards or even buy houses not that long ago or go to university for anything other than nursing or teaching. Thankfully we don\u2019t have to depend on men so we can have choice in men and standards. We can go to university, do our own thing, and get into relationships later on in our 30\u2019s when we get ourselves settled and independent. So the men that normally would want to be in relationships in their young 20\u2019s\u2026 well there\u2019s less women that want that. We also don\u2019t have to put up with shitty men anymore. We can biologically have babies into our 40\u2019s. Like why settle for some man at 20 years old when I have many years to figure that stuff out? \n\nIt\u2019s a societal shift. This isn\u2019t a stressed society lol.  Women not wanting to date is FINE and we\u2019re just going to get more and more self independent\u2026 also\u2026 we don\u2019t hate men nor are we scared of them. Where did you get this idea? Men are pissed they are equals and don\u2019t have the upper hand. \n\nWe are failing young men in the at fact that having fulfilling relationships with other men for some reason is \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cnot masculine\u201d, when in fact it\u2019s completely fine and we should encourage it. Women get to have those kinds of friendships with other women, which is another reason why we don\u2019t desperately want men because that part of our life is fulfilled. Men don\u2019t have much emotional intelligence sometimes, because guys didn\u2019t need to. They just needed to provide. If you read these posts of men upset they can\u2019t attract women they only really talk about how they have a house, car, good job. Cool, you\u2019re doing the bare minimum of adulting.\n\nRelationships aren\u2019t there to solve your depression and happiness. These men complaining are like 20-25 years old. It\u2019s not 35 year old men complaining. They focus their entire value on the fact they don\u2019t have a girlfriend. That\u2019s fucked. No generation of men is being failed. They\u2019re failing themselves by putting their entire value on the fact their penis hasn\u2019t been inside a vagina.\n\nEdit. Reading your post history\u2026 you have an extremely unhealthy view of sex\u2026 honestly please get therapy. I\u2019m not saying that to be an asshole, you need help and I hope you get the support you need.",

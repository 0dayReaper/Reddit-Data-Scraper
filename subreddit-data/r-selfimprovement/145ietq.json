    "postText": "More than 6 months ago, I failed my PhD.\n  \n\n  \nI know people younger than me (I'm 27) who have completed PhDs. Whereas in my case, I failed to fix the problems arising in my project, kept getting more delayed, and was entering a mental breakdown that made me even less productive, until they decided not to confirm my candidature.\n  \n\n  \nThis is a case of mind over matter. Because I was mentally weak, I failed because I couldn't do what was needed of me. Because I'm mentally weak, I probably would fail again if you gave me a new PhD position today.\n  \n\n  \nAlso, I have no other positive traits to compensate for my lack of PhD. I am trying to improve myself so that I can say something positive about myself, but so far, I'm failing at this goal too.\n  \n\n  \nOne of my friends suggested I learn coding languages in my spare time, and I'm failing that too. Thing is, everyone I know finds it easy, but even with their help, I'm still incapable of learning it. Should I just accept that I've peaked in life and have become impervious to learning? Because that's just pathetic of me.",

But I think you\u2019ve got more hope than you think. \n\nYour problem is, you\u2019re putting your self-worth into these arbitrary achievements. You\u2019re more than a PhD. You\u2019re a human being. \n\nWould you feel better about yourself if you were good at coding? What if coding simply isn\u2019t for you? \n\nIf you told a pencil to be a chair - it would fail. But if you told it to write, it would succeed. \n\nMaybe the things you\u2019re doing don\u2019t align with who you truly are, with you strengths. \n\nWe all have strengths - you need to search for yours. \n\n- \n\nYou also are very self-critical. I can relate. But you need to ease up on yourself. Yeah you might\u2019ve failed this time, but why can\u2019t you succeed next time? Identify the reasons you failed and tackle it again. It\u2019s not about if you won or lost, it\u2019s about what you learn from your losses. \n\nDon\u2019t label yourself as mentally weak. You are not mentally weak. You WERE mentally weak and that\u2019s why you failed. So to succeed, next time you feel your mind slipping, remind yourself that you are strong enough to overcome the adversity.\n\nHope this helps, you got this. \n\n- eren",

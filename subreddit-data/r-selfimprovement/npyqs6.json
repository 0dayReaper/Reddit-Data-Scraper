[*Stretch your neck by moving your head side to side stretching for a count of 3]\n\nRelax your legs.  [*then shake them one at a time]\n\nBREATH in your nose as deep as you can, counting to 5. Now,  exhale with a mental thank you. \n\nPeace unto you. \nMay much favor be realized and appreciated by you. \nMay you feel peace and a cheerful spirit the remainder of the day. \u2764\n\nI love you my friend!",

What happens is you find yourself having to do it 25 times a day or so to keep negative feelings down. Then what happens is the positive feelings start staying longer and longer. And pretty soon you only have to do it for maintenance. Remember--emotions CAN be controlled and you CAN improve your mental health just like your physical health. Hope that helps---Charles",

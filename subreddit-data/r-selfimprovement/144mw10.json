    "postText": "Hi r/selfimprovement, happy to be here! I've always been someone who aspires to prioritize my mental and physical health, but I've never had the self discipline or motivation to follow through with my goals. I just turned 25, and as I get older, my unhealthy habits are starting to catch up to me. I'm not looking to be the most disciplined or fit person of all time, but I do need to start to taking better care of myself. I am doing very well in my career, have a great social life, and am in therapy which has helped my anxiety a lot. However, I  struggle waking up on time and therefore spend the majority of my day running around frantically trying to get to things on time, have terrible eating and sleeping habits, don't exercise despite having a gym in my apartment building, and struggle a lot with sticking to a routine bc of aforementioned lack of self-discipline (I also have ADHD, but find routines are helpful... until i fall off the wagon).  I feel overwhelmed trying to get my life together and have no idea where to start. \n\nA bit of relevant background info and my goals:\n\n\\- I struggle a LOT to wake up on time, especially if I don't have somewhere to be first thing in the morning. I set my alarm for 7:30 every day, but can't remember the last time i actually got up at that time except to like travel or something.\n\n\\- I live in a large city and work in a creative field where socializing and networking is extremely important. The vast majority of my friends are also creative types, so many of my friends do freelance and/or don't have consistent work hours where they have to wake up at specific times. I work a 9-6 at a creative agency, 2 days in office, 3 days WFH\u2014 these days are flexible. Because I'm a creative, it's pretty acceptable to roll into the office late, which I've taken complete advantage of. I can't remember the last time I went into the office at 9am, I always stroll in late.\n\n\\- I typically don't wake up in time to eat breakfast, literally can not get out of bed until the last possible second, and that sets the tone for the day\u2014 constantly running around forgetting things and stressing out about being late places. \n\n\\- My night time routine isn't much better, I don't have a consistent bedtime. Because I don't have any personal time at the beginning of the day, I end up decompressing at night, which of course turns into procrastinating, staying up late reading or watching TV, feeling wired and gross and stressed and not actually relaxing. I don't spend my alone time working on my hobbies, even though I know it would feel better than laying on my couch doing nothing for hours on end. \n\n\\- I feel amazing when I am going to the gym consistently and I know its good for my mental health, but I can not get myself to go. I'd LOVE to workout in the mornings 3 times a week before I start working on days I WFH, but... it just doesn't happen. I always feel disappointed in myself when I realize I don't follow through. I'm starting to notice that I'm squishy, I'm not super concerned with losing weight, but I want to be in better shape and a bit more \"toned\". I look and feel better when I'm exercising.\n\n\\- I love cooking, but again, get lazy when I finish work and end up snacking or ordering delivery and then overeating and feeling crappy. I'd love to get into the routine of eating healthy, homemade meals when I'm alone, and save eating out for when I'm socializing. Again... I tell myself that and still end up ordering delivery or takeout.\n\n\\- My social life is super important to me, and I'd like to leave 2-3 evenings during the week open to see my boyfriend or friends, or do something interesting like going out or going to dinner. I feel invigorated and much more motivated the day after I go out with friends, but I don't know how to balance after work socialization with a healthy night time routine because i literally have no bedtime routine at all. \n\nThis all leaves me feeling really drained and overwhelmed by the end of the week. I always end my week feeling like I'm behind on things or disappointed that I didn't workout, eat homemade meals, get on a good schedule, or working on my hobbies. It's a really upsetting cycle where I just can not seem to hold myself accountable. The issue I run into is that all of my \"problems\" compound on each other and I am so confused as to how to start. If I don't wake up on time, I don't do any exercise, which leads to me eating poorly, which leads to me feeling fatigued and exhausted and unhealthy, which leads to me sleeping in, which leads me to stay up later- except im mentally drained so im not doing anything with those hours... then the cycle repeats. \n\nHelp me get my life in order please!!!\n\nTLDR; I have no clue where to start in order to get my life in order. I WANT to be productive and organized.",

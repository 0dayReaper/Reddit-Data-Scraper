            "comment": "First, ask yourself what causes you to lie so much. Is it because you fear people won't like you if you don't present a certain image? You'd be surprised how accepting people would be if you were just your authentic self. People appreciate honesty and vulnerability. You don't need to be something you're not in order for people to like you. \n\nAnd if people don't like you for your authentic self, those aren't people you would really want to be close to anyway.",

That attitude should lead you to great success.  \n\nWe all have choices in life and many years ago I chose to try to always do the right thing.  One reason is that by doing that I feel good about myself and the other reason is that I know that is what God expects from me.  \n\nWhen you are able to find the reason that you want to always tell the truth and that reason is important to you, I believe you will be able to break the habit.  A start, if you are bold enough, is to apologize to some of the people you have lied to, admitting that you have the problem, and telling them you are trying hard to change.  Likely, many of the people you lied to know you have lied anyway and may have greater respect for you knowing you are trying to change, especially since it takes guts to admit to them that you lied.",

It will definitely harm your relationships in the long run. So I would first sit down and think long and hard about the real reason you choose to do this, when others don't. What would happen if you wouldn't lie? What kind of situations make you want to lie?",

            "comment": "Look at your final sentence as a starting point. Having to come up with another lie to save your ass with the friend who caught on. But what happens when they catch on to that lie?\nThe reality is lying to that extent is just burrowing yourself down a rabbit hole that the further down you go the uglier it will be when you realize you have to dig yourself back out of it depending how far down you go. \n\nMy Ex was a pathological liar. He went deep into a  lie about still having his job when we were behind on our rent when he actually didn't, and when I caught on, he kept trying to go deeper with the lie. Once it all came out that he was still brining in money but not because he had a job but instead soliciting other gay men in my community for money for sex, the result was just as nasty as what one would expect with such a lie and I split up with him and still don't talk to him to this day and probably never will again.\n\nThe truth will always come out in the end so if you recognize lying is causing problems the answer is remembering that and by choosing to continue to lie you're only alienating and isolating yourself as people catch on.\nAlso you say you're very good at it, and while that may be true to some degree, it will never last for forever and people are probably more aware of it then you realize...may even be testing you themselves to see to what extent you're willing to lie to them to see if they can trust you at all or If you're worth keeping in their social circles or not...again speaking from personal experience myself \ud83d\ude09",

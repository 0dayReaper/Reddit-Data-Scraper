She lied in every single detail and small/big things throughout the relationship\n2. She cheated on me with many men and kept deleting chats and hiding calls\n3. She used me for money and even asked money back before breakup (I didn't give)\n4. She threatened me to kill herself with a knife if I would leave\n\nI cry everyday and I'm so hurt, please can you share advices on how to heal yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

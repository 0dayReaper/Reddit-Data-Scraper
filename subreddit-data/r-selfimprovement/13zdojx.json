            "comment": "In the most sincere way possible, I think you should consider seeing a therapist about this. Not because they are the answer for everything, but because I'm about 12 years down your current trajectory and to be honest things get a lot worse if not addressed. You can run hundreds of miles, lose all the weight and gain it back multiple times, re-do your wardrobe, get tailored shirts, hire fitness coaches, find and lose great relationships, meal prep until everything you own smells like broccoli....and you will still see unlovable brokenness in the mirror until you get help with the mental patterns creating the problem. Please take this seriously. I'm trying to do things right now but the price is incredibly high for not fixing the root cause here. I want you to be in a better place in 12 years than I am now. Wishing you all the best.",

            "comment": "You suffer from low self esteem, not from \"body dysmorphia\" or some other fancy modern disorders. Stop telling yourself that you're ugly and constantly looking for faults. Stop focusing on others and constantly comparing yourself to others. Focus on your life.\n\nWhy are you making such a big deal out of it? Work out because it's good for you and you should enjoy it, not because you're trying to impress others. If you're not enjoying your current workout, then either change your attitude towards it or find something you can enjoy.\n\nFigure out what you want in your life. But focus on the acitivities that you'd like to spend your time on, things that bring you enjoyment. If you enjoy comparing yourself to others to make yourself miserable, then keep doing that. But if there's other things you might enjoy more, then focus on those. Get out of your head and become more proactive. If you learn to enjoy working out or playing a sport you will do it regularly and will get in great shape naturally. Well, diet always plays a big role in it as well so you should look a bit into that, too. Though I'd avoid the mainstream sources that have been telling us lies for decades and are now pushing the vegan diet on everyone. I'd rather look into keto and carnivore and learn how diet really works and what makes us fat.\n\nBut you already mentioned getting compliments. What should that tell you? That you might not be as bad looking as you are? Well, it doesn't matter because you keep telling yourself otherwise and as long as you keep doing that you will always feel insecure about it. So stop doing that. Read some good self development books from Tony Robbins or Maxwel Maltz' Psycho-Cybernetics. They should teach you how to take control of your mind, when right now it is controlling you and making you miserable.",

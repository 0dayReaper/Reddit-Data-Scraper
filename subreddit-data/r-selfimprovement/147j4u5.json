    "postText": "hello, it\u2019s 5am and i\u2019m tired and i\u2019m shit at wording things so i apologize if this post is messy haha. feel free to ask questions if this doesn\u2019t make any sense\n\nfor some background, i have pretty bad abandonment issues which have made an incredibly negative impact on my life, especially since i started dating my girlfriend a little over a year ago. i\u2019m talking like if i\u2019m not being CONSTANTLY showered in affection and compliments i will break down and become incredibly depressed and anxious for weeks until i receive what my brain believes to be an \u2018adequate\u2019 amount of attention. i also become incredibly self destructive, there were even points where i straight up begged my girlfriend to break up with me because i felt so sorry for her. \n\ni\u2019ve been doing a bit better recently after i made a post about it a few weeks ago and someone was BRUTALLY honest to me in the comments. initially i was hurt, but i\u2019m genuinely so grateful i got the reality check i needed or else i don\u2019t think i would have even tried to make a change. \n\ni used to ask if she still loved me CONSTANTLY, but i haven\u2019t done it for weeks now and although that doesn\u2019t seem like much of an accomplishment, i\u2019m really happy i\u2019ve managed to do so :)\n\ni realized that i need to learn to love myself if i wanted this relationship to last. loving myself is something ive always been absolutely terrified to even attempt because i\u2019ve hated myself more than anything for so long and i don\u2019t believe i deserve to be happy. \n\ni\u2019m stuck in this cycle of being a bad person because i hate myself, but when i attempt to love myself i feel guilty for even trying to do so BECAUSE i\u2019m a bad person. but in order to be a better person i have to love myself so i get stuck in a loop. it\u2019s all so confusing and i don\u2019t know what to do. i just want to be better for her and i don\u2019t know how.",

Never give up because it takes time to get better.\nI don't have much to say about your specific struggles other than to be as kind as possible to your self! I comment also in order to not let the post die down",

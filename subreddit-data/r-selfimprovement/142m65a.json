    "postText": "I think the only way I can keep myself from spiraling into a deep depression rooted in the absolute meaningless of this existence and the artifice of human \"connection\" , is to become mentally unshakeable. \n\nIm someone who's parents didn't give them the proper amount of love care and understanding as a child , and now my adult life is littered with extremely painful heartbreak and failed connections because people are able to take advantage of me and manipulate me due to that deficit of love and self worth .\n\nIt crushes me extremely that I have to even deal with life with this hand of cards. I lose at the game of love every time and it's not even a game for me but it is for everyone else. It makes me feel like I'm not sociopathic for dating and society in general.\n\nTo others Im just a pretty object to fuck , and have fun with. To me , others are whole human beings with complex lives, and I'm interested in helping hem through there's any way I can. No one has ever been like that with me. \n\n\nBut that mindset is not compatible with the game of dating anyways. It's not about the potential deep connection, it's about having a pretty face to fuck , while pretending and lying to eachother that it's about something more . I'm only a commodity to be bought with enough compliments and sex. A pretty trophy to be shown off. The minute I show I'm human and have a problem with something , I'm an inconvenience that deserves to be discarded \n\nSo I don't want to play the game anymore . Relationships aren't worth the pain. I want one so bad but they just don't work for me. I was born without that love and the universe is telling me I don't deserve it and I'll never get it so fine.\n\nBut I need to become mentally fortified , to the point of being able to see the overall dynamic of most social situations. I need to be able to read people extremely well. I need to know how to manipulate, to be able to counter those that aim to manipulate me. How do I achieve these goals? I've tried reading intensely about charisma and FBI negotiation, but what I struggle with is truly feeling confident enough to just not care about what anyone says or feels in the midst of my actions . \n\nOr I guess the coldness to be able to say or do  things I know would sting in someone else . I really need to achieve this to feel like life is worth living, because the maybe the steps I take to improve myself won't fucking disappear when I try to connect to someone else and they decide to fuck me over.",

But if there's anything I can leave you with, its that the universe isn't saying you don't deserve love it is just saying you deserve better that whatever it is you have right now. It is preparing you to learn how to keep that amazing love without self sabotaging it (because of your childhood) when you do finally receive it. It may not show up immediately but you can be sure it will. The universe has proven this to me in different aspects of life (career, education)....like you, still waiting on the love aspect.",

            "comment": "All I can say is that self care and self goal setting will best build self worth and confidence. Even small and trivial seeming things like setting a goal for how much water you drink in a day, task lists for chores and self care things you want to do in a given day or time period, or just being sure you\u2019re active or spend time outside for like 45 min a day are some things that have helped me mentally and prove a lot to myself. \n\nI still suffer from a less than ideal self worth and I\u2019m still a huge work in progress but I have learned that proving things to myself and reaching even stupid small goals and milestones that me myself and I only know about has been a game changer. When you respect and value yourself, it makes other people more prone and likely to do so and even if some people don\u2019t then you\u2019ll be able to live with that :)",

            "comment": "Becoming aware is the first step (which it sounds like you are). Taking personal responsibility for your own emotions and well-being is the second step.\n\nThe reality is, most of us have experienced hurt and rejection at some point in our lives. It takes time to heal ourselves and develop self-love so we can attract the right partner and people and things who are in alignment with our true selves.\n\nWhen someone hurts us, it is not a reflection of our own worth. It is about them. It is teaching us how to be for ourselves what they couldn't be. And really, while it is helpful to be surrounded by those who support you, at the end of the day, no one can truly fill that void for you but yourself. Everyone else's love will pale in comparison to the kind of love only you can give yourself once you find that. This changes things from being in a disempowered state (allowing others to dictate how you feel about yourself) to being in this unshakeable, empowered \"I love myself no matter how anyone does or doesn't respond to me\" state.\n\nThere are people who are in the state of mind where they objectify others and don't want anything deep/real intimacy or a relationship. And there are also people who actually do want a deep relationship. The trick is learning how to spot the red flags and incompatibilities and weeding them out.\n\nEven if the majority want the opposite of what you are looking for, it doesn't matter. There will always be someone who is looking for a real relationship. Sometimes we just \"accept the love we think we deserve.\" So ask yourself if you feel you accept less than what you actually want and are compatible with because you feel you don't deserve more than that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I was born without that love and the universe is telling me I don't deserve it and I'll never get it so fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou ARE love even when those around you don't treat you well because they don't currently love themselves. In life, sometimes we experience the total opposite of what we want/need so we can more deeply understand what it is we really want and need. It can propel us into coming into alignment with ourselves to see the exact opposite of love portrayed to us. And it can cause us to rely more deeply on learning how to love ourselves, so that you can finally be set free of needing external validation. It may not seem like it, but it can be viewed as a gift rather than a curse when viewed through this lens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;But I need to become mentally fortified , to the point of being able to see the overall dynamic of most social situations. I need to be able to read people extremely well. I need to know how to manipulate, to be able to counter those that aim to manipulate me. How do I achieve these goals? I've tried reading intensely about charisma and FBI negotiation, but what I struggle with is truly feeling confident enough to just not care about what anyone says or feels in the midst of my actions .  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Or I guess the coldness to be able to say or do things I know would sting in someone else . I really need to achieve this to feel like life is worth living, because the maybe the steps I take to improve myself won't fucking disappear when I try to connect to someone else and they decide to fuck me over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiscernment is definitely key. I would say not to rush the process of trust. Go slow when you are just getting to know someone. Realistically, trust is earned over a period of months where the person shows that their actions match their words and they are consistent.\n\nThe way to outplay someone treating you poorly is not by becoming more like them, it is by refusing to play the game to begin with. So if you see a red flag(s), you can immediately set a boundary by walking away instead of sticking around. That's why taking your time getting to know someone at a slower pace and having someone earn your trust is an important factor. It prevents you from attaching prematurely to a person -- which can make withdrawing harder at that point. So it's not about manipulation, just discernment, wisdom. Knowing when to pull away and move on to focus on something else.\n\nIf you feel you are reaching your breaking point with people, it's usually good to just take a break. Time to relax and heal your heart through all that you've been through. Really nurture yourself. You are already a whole person all on your own. It sounds like you just need to realize this truth and work on healing and forgiving those who didn't love you like you deserved in your past.",

            "comment": "Life dealt me poor cards and I am a sociopath from the trauma I've lived.\n\nBeing cold, jaded and blunt is in my nature. However, you don't need to connect to someone to be with them.\n\nI am married and were both happy together. I cannot feel love. But, I know my actions make her happy because she smiles and reaffirms what I'm thinking. That is satisfying enough to me. And makes me believe I'm doing something right.\n\nIt isn't a manipulation, its a give and take with a person I can understand. I give her the attention she craves and I recieve having someone in my life that won't judge me for being myself and I can share my ideas.\n\nThe coldness to say something just to hurt someone that your referring to. Isnt something you should chase. But, to be that way comes from truly not caring how that person feels afterward. The sting comes from it being true and them knowing you meant what you said. I've absent mindedly hurt more people by not filtering my words than I've hurt when I'm intentionally attempting to hurt them.\n\nBut, if your actually trying to self improve. \n\nWrite down what you want. Analyze the steps to achieve it and find it. If your dating losers that take advantage of you, change your approach and find an archetype that fits your mold.\n\nIts gotten me where I am now and I'd argue I'm successful.",

            "comment": "I'm approaching this by thinking of myself as a manager of my self and my life. Part of that means finding safe ways to express emotions even if only when I'm alone, and adopting philosophies that emphasize a growth and learning mindset- that it is normal and ubiquitous to make mistakes, and that perfection is not possible. I would also say a part of being mentally unshakable is choosing to affirm perspectives that Don't demonize and put ourselves and other people under a microscope. We can zoom out and focus on the bigger picture of the suffering in the world and how we can work together to lessen it in ways also lessens our own suffering. We are all affecting one another and at the end of the day everybody has their own unique perspective for how they want to be affected by specific people and within specific moments. Just as I don't want other people to demonize and misunderstand me, I will not demonize and misunderstand other people, but instead assume there behaviors are because they are stressed, bored, missing information in their communication, afraid, or setting up a boundary that they're entitled to and protects them from things they aren't ready to interact with. A lot of practical factors cause our thoughts and perceptions to change, especially according to your stress level and beliefs related to who you are and what factors impact your ability to advocate for yourself. So many environments we get used to as the norm when in fact it is entrenched in unhelpful hierarchical, shaming and demonizing systems of managing ourselves and other people, which strips people's personal agency and can greatly diminish our capacity to see positive outcomes or to position ourselves in new experiences so we have a chance of learning theere are whole other ways of being and thinking. I am learning about this while taking my business courses, and I have experienced a little bit of it in my life, but mostly I have been privileged to avoid environments that enforce a pervasive and normalized degree of this type of hierarchy and unspoken power dynamics. but I think if you've been in it your whole life you lack a point of reference for what things feel outside of those cultures.\n\nI could be totally off on what you're thinking, but these are just the things that came to mind when I read your post.",

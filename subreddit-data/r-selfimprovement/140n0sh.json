    "postText": "So I'm someone with very low self-esteem. I grew up in a toxic household with Narcissistic abusive parents who verbally and emotionally demeaned me eveyday. I had no freedom and was socially awkward because of it. I was also overweight for most of my life, and this affected my confidence greatly. Because of all these things, I was never able to love myself. At the beginning of this year though, I finally decided to do something and changed my diet and hit the gym for the first time. It's been 5 months, and I managed to lose 20 pounds. I am physically fit now, and my friends tell me that I look good. The thing is, whenever my friends complimented me, I couldn't believe it because I feel like they were just flattering me or lying. Recently I started making a move on a girl. She's a coworker I've been friends with for a while. I have never been in a relationship before, but I worked up the courage to ask for her number and for us to hang out. She told me she was busy this weekend, but let's hang out next weekend. Ever since then, I've been feeling extremely insecure about her not really liking me and that she will flake on me. It doesn't really help that I am the one always initiating contact and she  doesn't really respond to my text. So I've been up in my head and convincing myself it was going to fail, but my friend set me straight. He told me about all the good things going in my life, like my fitness, my job, my hobbies, and that I needed to think of myself as a prize instead of putting other people on pedestals. That's when I realized my feelings of insecurity weren't even about her, but about myself. I was so obsessed with her because I wanted someone to love me because I couldn't love myself. I started realizing all of the people who have been acknowledging my hard work, from friends to coworkers. I've been so up in my head and so insecure, that I was not able to see what other people saw in me. Ever since then, I'm starting to feel more confident and I don't even really care that she is not responding to my texts. I realized I can't love anyone else until I learn to love myself. It's still a struggle though. Even though my brain knows this, my heart doesn't and the negative inner voice still creeps at me. But I'm gonna start putting in the work, stop apologizing all the time, and try to see myself as the prize. Thanks to anyone who read through all this, I appreciate it.",

Your worth comes from within not from what others think. Be kind to yourself and appreciate what you have. You're strong and capable. You can't control how others feel or act but you can choose how to react. Keep working on loving yourself and growing and don't worry too much about getting everyone's approval. You've got this!",

I cannot remember the last time I didn\u2019t see myself and hate what I saw. I could\u2019ve written your post. I started therapy 7 months ago (i was in a toxic job and was crazy stressed. Thought it was only the job.) Ha! I never dreamed that it would change my life. I am currently a codependent in recovery. Sending you good vibes in your journey! I didn\u2019t fully get it before, and loving yourself is pretty amazing.",

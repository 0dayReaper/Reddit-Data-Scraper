    "postText": "Dear Reddit users,    \ni wanna know if I should be embarrassed or not. I am 23, and I have never had a normal job. Currently, I am finishing my Master's degree abroad. During my Bachelor's, I was living with my family. I have done some stuff for them (helped my grandparents to build a house, drove around my siblings to courses and my mom to her job since she can't drive, took care of animals in the household, etc.) I hated my life, and I wanted to start my career, but I somehow failed cause I always had excuses to postpone a real job hunt (like busyness with courses or language studies, or stuff to do for my family, etc). But I felt like I was needed by my family and stayed. The longer commute to the Uni has added to my inability to find smth. Plus, on top of that, I was not that much motivated cause my expenses were very low, and my lunches were covered by a small scholarship from Uni for excellent studying. After finishing my Bachelor, I got a place in a Master's programme at a nice Business Uni abroad. It was very tough for me, and I felt like I was a clear underdog. Currently, I am writing my Thesis and have 1 course left.  \nHowever, what bothers me is that I have failed to find an internship or a job during my studies. Somehow I was rejected by places where my classmates had found employment. I am currently searching for a job, and I hope it will be easier with a finished Master's diploma. But I am very embarrassed that I didn't find employment during my studies and still live thanks to my grandparent's money. I don't have to pay Masters's (in Europe, it is free), but I still have living expenses (although I keep them at the minimum). I feel like I am a failure, and it prevents me from being productive. I was thinking about getting some side job like a delivery driver, but since I am not an EU citizen, it takes time to get a work permit, so I would rather focus on looking for a industry job and writing my Thesis. I regret not doing it a year ago. Still, I always found excuses not to (I was very depressed a 1 ago, but now it is much better, and at the beginning of this year, I was helping my brother with his studies, so I didn't have much time either). I also fouled myself by thinking I would manage to make some money online, I managed to start a website and have done some courses, but I was not quick enough to generate cash, and now it is too late to continue the effort because I need a real job to stay in the current country (I need a job to change my a stay of purpose from student to a work visa). On the bright side, if I find the job, I will save back the money I wasted on my living expenses in a few years.   \nI am sorry for a long post. Just writing it cleared my mind a bit. I hope I am not a failure and will manage. I might be outperforming compared to my classmates, but I am overperforming people with whom I was going to high school. But it doesn't help me to feel better cause I don't see my former schoolmates, but I see my Uni classmates a lot, and they are doing way better than me.   \nWould you call me lazy or stupid? Am I doing alright? Is it very embarrassing not to have a formal job until you are 23 years old? P.S. I am sorry for my English, I managed to relatively master it just recently, and I still make some mistakes.",

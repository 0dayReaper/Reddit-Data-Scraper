    "postText": "As human beings, we naturally ping off the people around us to dictate how we should behave (unless you're drugged out of your mind or something haha).\r\n\r\nThe people you talk to are subconsciously looking at your behavior to let them know how THEY should behave. \r\n\r\nIf you're uncomfortable and rigid, you send signals to the other person that they should be uncomfortable and rigid as well. \r\n\r\nIf you're judging yourself negatively, you're telling the other person that you're going to judge them as well.\r\n\r\nIf you're stuck in your head and you're overthinking what the perfect thing to say is, you're showing the other person that they should be worried about what they say as well. \r\n\r\nBeing way too harsh on yourself is the most common problem I see with people trying to work on their confidence or their conversational skills. And if you're personally experiencing these problems, I understand the struggle. I know it's not as simple as just \"relax and don't think so much!\"\r\n\r\nSo how DO you take that comfort that you feel with your close friends and carry it over into all your other social interactions?\r\n\r\nIt's about letting go.\r\n\r\nYou have to let go of the need to be perfect. You have to remove the pressure that you put on yourself. These are limitations that you've put on yourself; and only YOU can remove them. \r\n\r\nWhen you can do this, and when you can treat the person you're talking to as if they were a friend, they will subconsciously receive signals that they are allowed to feel comfortable as well!\r\n\r\nIt's magic. You will feel like you're doing nothing at all, and yet get compliments from people that you are \"so easy to talk to.\" \r\n\r\nThe journey to becoming the most confident version of yourself is not always comfortable\u2026 but it's worth it.\r\n\r\nIf you need help with this, let's have a conversation. Comment down below with what you need help with. If I'm not able to answer anyone, I'm sure someone else with great experience will be able to help you out. Let's work together to create amazing social lives!\r\n\r\nP.s. If you'd really like my help specifically, feel free to send me a message. I respond to those quicker.\r\n\r\nCheers!",

Also, practicing with new people you meet, no matter where you are. \n\nI used to have really bad communication skills too and the main issue was the overthinking process  that was going on in my head while trying to have a conversation. \n\nI\u2019ve just recently started working at a new place and since day 1 I just decided to be the fun, \u201c\u201dextroverted\u201d\u201d person, so I would arrive to work and talk to whoever I saw. About the first thing that comes to my mind. That\u2019s the great thing about small talk, you can talk about anything and it sounds good. \n\nAlso being really kind helps too. I try to help people at work if they have any issue and I also ask for help when I need it (that\u2019s how I had my first conversation at my job the first day).\nI also say nice things to people when I think them.  For example, I have this coworker that sounds great on the phone ( I work as a telephone operator), so one day we were having lunch with everyone and I told her \u201cyou sound really good, have you always been a telephone operator??\u201d and she started telling me about her life, while also taking the compliment and feeling better about herself. People love compliments. \n\nAnother coworker I have is from the USA (I\u2019m from Spain) and she said so when we were presenting ourselves to the class. When I saw her after I asked her what part of the USA she was from, and she also started telling me about her life. We talked for the entire lunch break, she even showed me a photo of her son. \n\nTry to talk to people the way you\u2019d like to be talked to. Smile, be kind and be present (not in your head while talking to people) and you should have a nicer time having social interactions (we are allowed to have bad days though!).\n\nGood luck!",

Normally, they will ask you the same thing, and if you've done nothing special, you can just say, I had a relaxing weekend, hung around the house etc etc. \n\nThe weather is a good topic too, because everyone knows the weather and with Summer here, and covid slowing down, everyone is out and people are out and about. So when you strike up a conversation, it  might lead to their Summer activities. They might  tell you they're going to a concert of somebody you like or travel to a place you would like to go, and then the conversation will flow so easily. \n\nFor me, when I have a conversation with someone, I pick up on little things in the conversation to start a new one when that one has died out. \n\nI hope this helps.",

I think mostly because I just don't know how and what to respond. This happened even in my own mother tongue. \n\nOn the other hand, English is my second language. I didn't like my own voice whenever I talk. I was scared about my pronunciation and my intonation that people won't understand me. People are also easily offended nowadays so that's another fear that stops me from speaking to practice more. Then I found an English app that helps fix pronunciation and learn daily conversation. Here is where it really takes off. I feel a significant difference like the mental blocks in my head being let go. I talk more naturally, listen to people better and they can hear my voice more clearly too. I used to find it so difficult just to transfer my thoughts to my mouth. Then I got compliments like \"i like your voice, so sweet and soothing\", \"you don't look shy and nervous at all as you claimed\" at one of my job interviews. I straight up breaking down and crying. So embarrassing \ud83d\ude02\n\nI never thought I could remove those blocks, but I think I'm on a much more positive track/frequencies instead of negative one all my life.",

Druggies, drunks, douchebags, morons, stuck-up folk, etc, so talking to someone nervous, or lacking social skills doesn't really sound bad in the grand scheme of things. Actually sounds kinda delightful compared to them! So go practice making small talk with people who won't remember you, to make it easier.\n\nThen join a local hobby meet up! Never say \"no\" to an opportunity to join others.",

This is applicable to everything from dating to just meeting new friends. Be yourself, and be genuine, being nervous is okay as long as you are sincere.\n\nPeople are amazing at recognizing intent, generally, with the exception being people who are naive or people who are judgmental(in which case you should avoid them anyways.) Humans notice micro movements everywhere unconsciously, and register them in order to match them with other signals.\n\nAlso, this advice only works with decent people. It won\u2019t work with gold diggers, trophy wife hunters, social status climbers, and the like which is a good thing because you don\u2019t want those people in your life unless you are the type of person who is okay with transactional relationships(not judging as everyone is entitled to live their life in the manner that they choose as long as everyone involved is a consenting adult.)",

                    "comment": "Eye contact is both a signal for hierarchy in communication and a evolutionary safety mechanism. If you place the person you're talking to as more important, powerful, or attractive etc you'll naturally struggle to maintain eye contact. Same goes for the opposite if you believe you are greater than another person in a hierarchy eye contact becomes easy.\n\nHowever, this comes from a win lose paradigm, where one person is greater than another. It was useful in our evolutionary survival to have leaders and followers and for whatever other reason and for this to be communicated using our eyes. This meant you could easily communicate you weren't a dominant member of a tribe if someone was looking to usurp leadership.\n\nSociety has evolved where we can live in a win win paradigm if we choose to. Meaning instead of seeing someone as above or below they are seen as an equal. If you truly believe in equality and value people as equals regardless of importance, power, or attractiveness then subconsciously you won't have trouble looking them in the eye.\n\nThis isn't as simple as it sounds however because your beliefs are influenced by society and generally society, especially the media leans towards promoting a win lose paradigm. Think the glorification of wealth, power, status, attraction, etc. But, if you're strong in your belief and remind yourself regularly that you live in a win win paradigm its much easier for your subconscious behaviors to reflect that.\n\nLastly if you want to practice, just look people in the eye more until you feel comfort. Its always awkward to begin with.",

    "postText": "The purpose of this post is to help other young men struggling with the big question:  \nHow do I stop being depressed, and start building a life I can look forward to.  \nBefore I learned what I'm going to share with you, I was passively suicidal, meaning I didn't want to live but I was too much of a pussy to kill myself.  \nToday I wake up at \\~6AM each morning with a smile on my face excited to do purposeful work...  \nOh I should add, I'm on ZERO medications. So I did this all though modifications in my personal choices.  \nIn a nutshell: Depression is the result of consistently performing actions that trade your future away for short term pleasure today.  \nThe solution, gradually start tapering down activities destroying your life, and increasing activities that improve your life.  \n\"Yeah but how am I supposed to do that if I have zero motivation, I'm depressed.\"  \nExcellent question.  \n\\#1 Find a good reason why:  \nI'd recommend picking both a selfish reason, &amp; a noble reason.  \nTo identify your selfish reason: look at what you crave or envy in others.  \nIf you still watch porn, let your drive to self improve be to be able to ACTUALLY date the beautiful women you jerk off to.  \nMaybe it's to show people they were wrong for doubting you.  \nMaybe it's to get a lot of money and live the rest of your life by the beach in Fiji.  \nTo identify a noble reason: identify the pains you have and think about how good it would feel to help others get rid of that pain.  \nFor me the biggest pains I've had were learning how to date growing up without a father.  \nConstantly wanting to die due to having an aimless existence.  \nNot knowing what or how to socialize.  \nSTOP HERE. DO THIS NOW:  \nGet your phone, create a note stating:  \n\"The reason we're going to improve our life is because of A. insert selfish reason &amp; B insert noble reason. \"  \nScreenshot the note and make it your background.  \n2. After you identify your reason why, it's time to get to work.  \nIn order to achieve your goals you need self control.  \nThere's two STUNNING ways to get self control and I recommend practicing both for MINIMUM 30 days.  \nMeditation for 10 minutes.  \nWorking out 3-4x per week.  \nHere's how to get started.  \nFor meditation look up on youtube: Hamza Meditation Guide.  \nEssentially it's this, every morning allocate 5 minutes to focus on your breath.  \nWhen your thoughts trail off, gently come back to your breath.  \nThis teaches your brain how to stop following impulses, allowing you to start sticking to goals.  \nThis will also build your sense of calm and confidence.  \nNext THE GYM HABIT.  \nWhen you start respecting your body and investing in it, you naturally start to feel a sense of pride, this will raise both your happiness &amp; your discipline.  \nHow to start at the gym.  \nPersonally I started with Hamza complete aesthetic body guide + Jessy Nippard technical videos.  \nTo start at the gym, just focus on building the habit of going for the first 45 days doing EXTREMELY easy exercises.  \nOnce you have the habit you can start increasing the intensity and actually building muscles.  \nIt took me 3 months to integrate the habit of going every other day.  \nThen at 6 months I would go Arm day, Leg day, rest day.  \nIt's been 2 years now and it's one of the best decisions I've ever made.  \nSTOP NOW DO THIS:  \nUpdate your phone note to say: \"You have only two goals to focus on for the next 90 days. Meditation and going to the gym every other day for 1hr. \"  \nFocus on this for 90 days and you'll have a basis for discipline, and personal pride.  \nI'll drop part 2 later, it's getting too much to write but start here boys.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m sure this sub gets a million of these posts but I\u2019m hoping for some outside perspective. \n\nBackground: 27M, based in California\n\nI\u2019m in tech sales which is usually fairly lucrative but right now I\u2019m stuck on an incredibly unfulfilling project, but as a result I now have some spare time to really find what I want to do in life/career/side hustles etc. Unfortunately, this is where I\u2019m struggling. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m not actively pushing myself forward. My friends and family tell me I should be happy with what I\u2019ve accomplished and that things take time (and I get that!), but to me, being too focused on what\u2019s happened is just being complacent about the future. \n\nI\u2019ve made some lists of things that make me happy, things that make me unhappy, and things that I know I want to do, but they\u2019re pretty abstract and don\u2019t offer a ton of insight into how to turn the words into action. \n\nI see friends and peers excelling and I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m falling behind. \n\nHas anyone had success with a particular method for analyzing your goals/wants/desires and actually formulating a plan for your future?\n\nI am eager to have something to work towards, right now all I see is a big mishmash of potential options and I feel like every day that I don\u2019t dedicate myself to setting and accomplishing goals, I\u2019m falling behind. \n\nPlease help, I\u2019m more lost than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. I don\u2019t want to get to 40,50,60 etc and look back on my life and feel like I\u2019ve failed or didn\u2019t take advantage of the time while I had it.",

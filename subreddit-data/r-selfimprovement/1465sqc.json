    "postText": "Hello everyone, I'm not even sure exactly what I need to work on, but I figured having some outside perspective may benefit me to some degree so here I am. I feel like I have done nothing since graduating high school 10 years ago, especially when compared to peers. This may be long and convoluted, as I chronologically recount my experiences, so bare with me. I appreciate any advice I get here!\n\nI did finish a science degree at a local university, which I regret in retrospect due to the lack of resources and lack of pushing me out of my boundaries. I had social anxiety that affected me functionally back then and also a few bad experiences, which resulted in a bad first year gpa-wise. This really shot me down and I struggled to raise my GPA to a competitive mark for vet school, which I was initially seeking. I started with signs of depression and feeling inadequate to my peers who seemed to be doing fine that year. I also had very little guidance in terms of university. My father tried to help, but his experiences were different from mine. The academic advisors at my university were also a 'revolving door' and so were often new and unfamiliar with the university and programs. Approaching graduation,  I really thought If I made it out with a degree, I'd have decent career opportunities, which didn't happen. I tried applying to multiple places, but I am in a bilingual city and am not bilingual, so all I could manage were minimum wage jobs, while many friends were bilingual and at least got into government jobs. I graduated with no student debt, but ultimately felt frustrated at being unable to obtain a career. Luckily I do have great parents who have been awesome supports and encouraged me on. \n\nI spent a gap year working and then went back into university under a different degree, hoping to raise my grades this time to apply to medical school. I obtained a scholarship that covered part of my tuition. I did actually do well, but then the pandemic hit- this combined with multiple projects and part-time jobs I was juggling spiraled me into burn out.  I also got into a new romantic relationship and although he was a great guy, he demanded more of me than I could give and I realized we wanted different things, so I broke it off.  Simultaneously, I dealt with a few situations that spiraled me into deeper depression. I cried nearly every other day for 3-4 months. I lost a few friends who I had realized were not good friends and pretty self-centered. However, that also meant I only had two friends left, who were not close by. Following the burn-out, I knew there was no way I could write the MCAT and go through the admissions process, so I applied to an accelerated nursing program and was accepted. I liked that nursing provided a definite opportunity for employment, as well as travel and flexibility in a shorter period of time. \n\nHere is where I am at now: \n\n I am half way through the program and nursing is not what I thought. I plan to continue the program as I think not having a career at this point is contributing to my depression and I hear nursing is different in real practice. We have unions for nurses here and it is a good career nevertheless. But I do feel a sense of loss for what I want to be and really struggle with retrospections, regretting previous choices. I want more for myself, but at this point, my depression has caused me to be constantly tired and worn out. I also feel that my memory has gotten bad. I feel as if I am a burden to my parents and wish I could do more for them. They have been so good to me and have worked so hard that I wish I could treat them instead of having them look out for me. I feel a sense of shame with having no career accomplishment nor significant other and this holds me back from connecting with peers, as I assume judgement or no commonality.\n\n I don't really have a social life anymore. The one friend whom I have been close with often compares our situation these days (as far as looking up a nurse's salary) and that really does hurt me. I don't think it comes from malicious intent, but it has kept me from reaching out to her and I'm finding myself slowly closing up from other potential friends. I struggle with romantic connection. I am not really sure why, but I am extremely cautious in romantic relations and struggle finding someone I am truly attracted too. I did start with romantic relationships later in life than many. \n\nMy 10 year HS reunion is coming up this summer and I am absolutely not going; however, this has just made me feel a pit of despair concerning my choices and current situation. At this point, I'm just a professional student and I can't believe 7 years of schooling has gone by seemingly so fast. My depression has just been spiraling the past 2-3 years and it is something I constantly fight. Therapy is unfortunately not an option, as I don't have the finances for it. I truly think that if I hadn't such kind, understanding, and supportive parents, I would have become suicidal. However, sometimes I feel I don't deserve their unconditional love because I have done nothing to be proud of. I have even avoided going to family events, as I fear comparison to my cousins, who I deem more successful than myself.\n\nI really do want to get better and strive for better. I have worked through my social anxiety, which no longer impedes me like it did in my early 20's. However, now it is feelings of despair and inadequacy that plagues my mind and causes me to be excessively tired with anhedonia on many days.",

            "comment": "Hey! \n\nI read your story and wanted to share with you my own because it\u2019s similar to yours and maybe it might give you some perspective. If you don\u2019t want to read the whole story, you can skip to the end below.\n\nIn my late 20\u2019s I worked in mining and really didn\u2019t enjoy it other than the people I worked with were some of the most amazing people you can find anywhere.\n\nA few years later I lost that job overnight due to a dam collapsing which shut the mine down. So I thought at the time it would be a great opportunity to go back to school and learn something completely different. I enrolled in a hybrid program that involved UI/UX design, marketing, and programming. \n\nAfter completing a 2 year program I enrolled in a year long program to study in the UK and finish my bachelors degree. So I did. I thought doing so would open so many more doors and companies would beg me to come work for them\u2026I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. \n\nI came home to my wife and I separating, having to sell all our assets ( home, cars, etc), lived in a friends den/closet for 8 months battling crippling depression and anxiety while still trying to kick start a new career in a field I had only academic experience in. I also burned though a big portion of my life savings doing so. \n\nAfter 3 years I had enough and decided I needed to move back with my parents 4 hours away from my friends and the city. Also keep in mind I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s now so the idea of this made me even more anxious and depressed. \n\nThen Covid hit\u2026\n\nAfter about a year my uncle reached out and I got a job as a labourer in the movie industry. It wasn\u2019t glamorous, but it got me back in the city and closer to where I wanted to be\u2026.Until I tore my distal bicep tendon and was out of a job again and on disability for 4 months. \n\nAfter healing, I had a couple of months with steady work until the end of the season for the show and then you have to find more work by putting your name on a list. But because I was so junior there was no chance of getting a call. So I was back to applying for work. \n\nI landed a job in legal marketing and almost immediately knew this was not for me. The lawyers didn\u2019t think they needed marketing and the ones that did didn\u2019t understand what I was trying to do for the firm so it was like wrangling kittens every. single. day. \n\nI was let go, believe it or not, TWICE from two different firms. So I was done. Btw this is not a reflection of skill, but a reflection of how cut throat that industry is. I cannot wait until ChatGPT replaces them \ud83d\ude02\n\n\nI had a few interviews, but all of them were very low paying and tbh you get to a point in life where titles and clout just is all bullshit\u2026 really.\n\nI applied to a mining company and I start at the end of the month. \n\n\ud83d\udc47\n\nBut this is the part I want you to understand. I did all of this and came out only where I started. But, I gained SO much more perspective, love, appreciation and knowledge then I ever would have if I had just given up or stopped chasing my dream\u2026which I still am chasing. \n\nNEVER be ashamed or embarrassed by how far you have come. It\u2019s your journey, you decide what\u2019s best for you. Don\u2019t give up and don\u2019t compare yourself to others because you are unique in your own way and I know eventually you will find a path that\u2019s right for you. \n\nOn a side note, if nursing is still something you want to pursue, maybe look into becoming a traveling nurse. I have a few friends who are and love the adventure of working and living in new cities. Plus as a bonus the company they work for pay for their accommodation\u2026like wtf lol \n\nFor anxiety try listening to Weightless by Macaroni Union before bed. It\u2019s engineered to lower your heart rate and allows you to focus on rest and mindfulness. Also cheaper than therapy. \n\nAlso, romantic connections will come. There is a lobster out there for everybody so don\u2019t think it\u2019s not going to happen, just give yourself time. \n\nYou got this. \ud83d\udcaa",

                    "comment": "Thank you for sharing your experience \ud83d\ude0a It\u2019s true. I\u2019m glad I applied for nursing and I actually already have a job lined up a year before graduation, which is promising. It might not be what I envisioned myself doing, which is what causes me so much emotional conflict; however, it will provide me experiences that I can perhaps build on for the future, so I intend to see it through. \n\nI think I really do need more for myself though and will need to figure that out with time, but financial security is first. I don\u2019t know if wanting more will lead into more education or starting side projects, but I guess I will have to see how I am feeling in nursing. \n\nFor romantic relationships, I worry because I haven\u2019t experienced genuine connection for any guy yet, including my ex. I actually felt quite smothered in my last relationship and I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call my ex overbearing. I really hope I\u2019ll meet that lobster some day, but I worry with my luck that day won\u2019t come.",

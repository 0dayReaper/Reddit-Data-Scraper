I\u2019m exhausted physically and emotionally, and I don\u2019t have friends to share with so that\u2019s why I\u2019m texting here. \nWell I think about to jump out of window everyday aahahha\u2026. \nI\u2019m always alone, in school, in the university, in the job and I\u2019m tired of it. Also I have never been in relationships because when people see me, I look arrogant and unsociable but it is not like that\u2026.\nWhat am I supposed to do?",

    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nAs my title says I\u2019ve been invited to my 10th year high school reunion but it makes me really anxious because these parts 10 years haven\u2019t been great. I\u2019ve dealt with mental health issues, recently gotten out of an abusive relationship, my finances are horrendous, I\u2019m only working a casual job and don\u2019t have a career, I coasted through most of the past 10 years and barely have anything to show for it. I know lots of people I went to school with are married, have kids, are working as doctors and lawyers, have travelled all around the world. High school wasn\u2019t particularly fun for me, I was a bit of an outcast.\n\nWhat could I do in the next 5 months to turn my life around and feel like I\u2019ve achieved something? Do I bother going at all?\n\nThank you",

What\u2019s the purpose of attending? If that purpose doesn\u2019t mean something to you, no need to even worry about it.\n\nYou can always set goals for yourself to align your life more closely with what you want it to be, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a for a high school reunion. Six months from now, you can look back and be proud of the goals you\u2019ve met so far, for yourself.",

You've faced challenges and disappointment and you're still here. You are valid merely for existing. If you decide to go, just have fun. Fuck what others think.",

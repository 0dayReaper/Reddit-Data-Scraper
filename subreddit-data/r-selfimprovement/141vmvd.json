            "comment": "The creative adult is the unforgotten child.\n\nFrom my perspective, the key is to live a life that is meaningful to you. Before you can do that you need to define what meaningful means to you. \n\nThere is no extrinsic meaning to life. There is no extrinsic purpose for life.\n\nSo meaning must be intrinsic and self-defined. \n\nIt sounds like you are a young person. It's likely that your adults, in good faith, have impressed upon you what it means to be good and what their expectations are. Certainly their actions have revealed their inner mind on this point.\n\nNow, let's assume that you are an adult, or near to being considered one, and so you must take it upon yourself to determine if your childhood examples are relevant for the world you find yourself in. \n\nIt's possible that you'll want to keep some of the lessons and let go of others. As an autonomous and self sovereign human you have the right to make those decisions. Those closest to you may or may not agree, but that's irrespective. It is your right to live your life in pursuit of your definition of meaning. \n\nIs growing up a trap? \n\nAn indoctrinated form of \"growing up\" may very well be a trap. You may like to observe people in their 30s, 40s and 50s who had been following a prescription of \"being grown\" and are now trying to shuck that off to discover their own definition. You'll find these people to be generally holding some regrets and struggling with letting go of hand-me-down doctrine. \n\nSo this form of unexamined growing up will trap an individual under the auspices of being good for society.\n\nIs self-improvement a trap?\n\nThe type of hard core influencer, points seeking, recursive self-improvement could be. It depends on why the acts are being practiced. \n\nIsn't it nice to get better? It certainly can be. The determining factor is in the why. \n\nIf one has a clear why then there is a clear understanding of why one wishes to engage in self-improvement.\n\nIf one is foggy on their definition of meaning then some self-improvement practices, even those practiced without conviction, can be healthy and help one get to a place of clarity, but it is possible to engage in a form of toxic self-improvement. \n\nAgain, is the activity being engaged because of an intrinsic desire or because of a form of societal pressure? \n\nWho do you want to be?\n\nWhat do you want out of life?\n\nWhat do you want from the world? \n\nWhat do you want to give to the world?\n\nWhat will these wants require? Explore widely. Talk to the old and examine the world you live in. \n\nWho and what would you like to emulate? \n\nExamine your life and the options before you. \n\nIf you want to be like everyone else, that is well. You can spend a life similar to the way everyone else spends a life.\n\nIf you want to be different then you must do things that very few people do. In some ways this will be the more difficult journey. In others, it will be the only journey you could abide because that would be the way that allows you to be true to your own self. \n\nAnd most importantly, you must be true to your own self. Because it is you who you will lay down every night and it is you who will talk to yourself every morning. And you must be able to abide the conflicts, struggles, failings, and victories of that person without losing yourself.\n\nListen, let go, then live.",

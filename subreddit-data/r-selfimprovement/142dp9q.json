Depending on your aim you might not even need to get a degree (if it\u2019s with tech you can often get a certification). \n\nFunny enough with languages people have this misconceptions about languages that it\u2019s best to learn as a kid but you as an adult can learn any language wayyyy better than any child. The only difference is children don\u2019t get dejected if they mess up. \n\nPeople get their degree in their 60s, why would you think they couldn\u2019t?",

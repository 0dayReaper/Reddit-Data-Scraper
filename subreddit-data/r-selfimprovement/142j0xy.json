    "postText": "I saw a post here a few days ago that got me really excited. \n\nThis guy dropped all his vices on weekdays and immersed himself in sales for 3 months straight.\n\nI love this because I just *know* that guy has experienced years of personal growth within that time period.\n\nBut a lot of people on this sub were against him. And it's not the first time I've seen that. So I wanted to take a minute and talk about why a person would go that hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the thing: I don't think the same way a lot of you do.\n\nI grew up in the 80's with ADHD. I'm highly empathic and sensitive to people.\n\nThat was a horrible combination and resulted in a horrible childhood. A lot of teachers didn't like me and I *felt* it. Kids didn't want to play with me. I was a loner for years at a time. I didn't touch sports, never achieved good grades, and had my first kiss at 19, well after almost every other guy my age was having sex.\n\nAll that led up to mock suicide attempts in my early 30's. I drove around with a hose in the back of my truck, just in case I decided this would be the day.\n\nAnd then one day, I decided, \"Fuck this. I *know* what I have to do. I'm going to do it and if it doesn't work, *then* I can check out.\"\n\nThat day, I started going way harder than I ever had before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you grow up in an environment where you're praying for a scrap to fall off the table, eventually you start to notice that other people don't have those problems.\n\nWhen you live in that kind of discomfort, you basically two choices: live a resigned life or fight back hard. \n\nThat's what David Goggins did. Wes Watson did the same thing. Will Smith has this worth ethic. \n\nThere is no question that for these men, it's worked out well. It's worked out well for me and I'm sure it's going to work out well for the guy ya'll were razzing on the weekend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoing hard is now my standard and I improve constantly. For me, it looks like this:\n\nIf I set a timer on the elliptical for 30 minutes, I *never* stop when the timer goes off.  \n\nWhen I'm doing yard work, I stop when the job is done - not when I'm tired. Sometimes that means my day starts at 6 AM and I finally turn on Zelda at 9 PM - or not at all.\n\nIf I'm studying, I crush my flashcards until I start recognizing the principles in daily life. Then I practice the shit out of them until they're second-nature.\n\nI do not fuck around, because I know things can get so bad that you'll start to believe your kids are better off without you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy childhood wasn't like a lot of yours.  I have no idea what it's like to grow up making friends, being able to talk to girls, or go to school without being bullied. Perhaps a lot of you really *can* achieve your goals with a toned down approach.\n\nI can't.\n\nMaybe I never learned the strategies you did. Maybe my ADHD really *does* block me from some approaches. Who knows, and more importantly, who cares? I don't worry anymore about what never was. I just look ahead to what skill I'm going to build next.\n\nThis approach is so ingrained in me that it even comes out in the way I talk. My identity-level belief is that I can crush any goal I choose to pursue. \n\nNothing stands in my way. \n\nNot enough energy? I still see fat on my stomach. Let's keep pushing. That's what it's there for.\n\nNot enough money? Drop something else to afford the $10 book and let's get started.\n\nNot enough time? Less time on the video games and more focus on efficiency.\n\nNot enough skill? Build the skills that support the skill I'm trying to build.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you go at that level, it starts to show on your body. I'm in good shape and I haven't lifted in two years.\n\nIt shows in your mind. Outside of life endangerment, you're fearless. You don't complain. You don't procrastinate. You just get down to business.\n\nIt shows in your body language. You're confident af, because you're constantly achieving a high standard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it's not for you, that's fine. It's a serious shift in priorities and values, but for guys like me, it's the most fulfilling life you can imagine.",

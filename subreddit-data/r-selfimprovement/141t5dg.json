    "postText": "I am the personality type where If I am not constantly trying to self improve or schedule my life, I fall into a deep dark pit of doing absolutely nothing, never moving forward, smoking, not working out, playing video games. \nI began scheduling out my days, waking up on time, having a routine, meditating, quitting smoking, working out daily, eating healthy, etc and I am 10x happier. Every 2-3 weeks I have a habit of going into what I like to call Degenerate Mode. Where I completely give up on my daily tasks and rot in bed for 2-3 days and falling into the same habits I try to change.\nI smoked for the first time in 4 months and I liked it. I considered completely abandoning my schedule for 2 - 3 days and going back to it afterwards, which is what I have been doing every 3 weeks basically. I seem to always end up in this pit even though I know long term I would be way better off if I stuck to my schedule and routine of self improvement. I always end up feeling guilty after me 3 day binge of degenerate mode. Any advice?",

            "comment": "You have adhd? This sounds a lot like me and the struggles I have faced. It sounds like you value you're autonomy. I used to have a coach who called me Ricky Bobby, \"because he likes to go fast\". I didn't realize until later that this was a perfect description of my nature. I like really really high intensity focused activities and seek heavy stimulation. When you can successfully channel this into productive things, it feels god damn amazing, and add weed its even better. But your body and mind crash and seek new stimulation. You probably can't do the same thing every day as it starts to feel monotonous.\n\nAll I can suggest is what I have done recently. Completely quit weed. I never anticipated that I would be suggesting that to anyone as I have loved it so much and have used pretty incessantly for the past decade. If anything, I think it will help you not fall into degenerate mode so violently. I'd stay up till 4 in the morning completely satisfying my every craving. Weed, porn, games, making music.\n\nI never properly weighed the cost of the weed because It made the things I like and do focus on so much better. I can't pretend I know how weed effects you. But for me I would be just absolutely charged up for the next couple hours. When I was put to my devices and was able to creatively export that energy how I wanted, things were great. But I always a loner so when   it came time to socializing and doing things where you must moderate your energetic output, things get squirelly. To me, anxiety was direct imbalance of wanting to poutput all my energy, then my conscious mind telling me \" wait, you cant just unload on people, you have to follow all these specific rules\" So it was essentially like trying to put cork in a high pressure tube. I just felt like I wanted to explode around people. Very uncomfortable.\n\nSince quitting weed my anxiety has gone way down. I'm actually in a place where I can talk to people without that rushy energetic feeling taking me over. I'm essentially just rambling now, but this sounded like me so much I thought I would just share my experience in hopes that you find it at least somewhat relatable and realize that theres small changes you can make to at least deter some of the more negative aspects you are feeling.\n\nI recommend replacing those hobbies( weed &amp; porn) with newer ones, and not just random ones. Hobbies that you think serve a VERY specific purpose. For example\n\nGardening - keeps you invested consistently in going outside  and moving around. It's good because you start to invest emotionally in your plants. If you don't go out and take care of them, they die. That means no more big pay off of nutritious food at the end of the season that you've spent weeks taking care of. Really enforces consistency in oneself. Th longer I do it, the more I realize how much there is to learn and grow from by upholding a little ecosystem.\n\nYoga - a lot of people sleep on this one I think due to stereotype and fear of what others will think. The shit is hard. Dont think so? Do hot yoga. I'll do an hour and 30 long session in my garage with the doors closed. I found this one really helped a lot with anxiety. Learning how to push yourself through pain and discomfort while keeping your mental and physical energies balanced rather than all chaotic and adrenaline driven like video games might do is a good direction to go in.\n\nArtistic endeavor - Doesn't really matter what you choose. Just be creative. Sit there and tell yourself\" What is something that doesn't exist that I would like to see exist\" Then rack your mind trying to figure out how you can bring the imaginary into reality. It's very hard problem solving type of work. The less you really on sources telling you exactly how to do said thing, the better. Developing a creative muscle will reward you in all areas of your life. Not just the creation of art itself. You'll learn a lot about yourself as well as you dig deep into yourself and realize whatever the fuck it is in you that makes you care about life in the first place. Well, at least for me it does that.\n\nSorry if this was sort of a generic and roundabout advice. I saw a lot of myself in your post and wanted to throw a few things your way that have been helping me. Good luck OP",

The problem with this is everybody has these difficulties / behaviors. What makes it ADHD is that they (some combination of symptoms, not all are present) are turned up to 11 and negatively impact our daily lives. \n\nThere are like 12 plus types of medication so even if you get diagnosed with it it's difficult to find the right medication especially if we can't keep on track with our appointments (super difficult for me) and I also have a hard time remembering my pills even when I can I get into the habit of taking them everyday for 2 weeks straight because \"working memory\" and inability to focus or not get distracted by things I see on my way to other places really hurts any kind of schedule I'm trying to keep. \n\nThere are lots of coping strategies you can try before medication though, and also with medication that make meds temporary while you're trying to incorporate coping strategies. Check out The YouTube videos \"30 essential ideas you should know about ADHD\" and the YouTube channel \"how to ADHD\" If you think you might have these symptoms. They are really really helpful!!!",

I thought I was the same, and I do indeed have a tendency to get seriously obsessed with certain hobbies / activities for several years at a time. As I started developing a cannabis habit in my mid twenties I knew I had to be conscientious of my use, or else I'd slip into obsession territory again. Now 5 years later through trial and error, I've seen that with other life things in check (social, financial, career, sleep, diet etc) - not neccesarily perfect but at least nothing severely lacking in quality - then I don't crave it as often, and don't need as much when I do use it to \"quench my craving\" as it were. However, it's worth mentioning that to me the cannabis is an important part of the equation to make me feel that life is full and compelling. So for me, quitting has proven itself to lead to binging episodes similar to the ones you've described.\n\nThis is all really anecdotal and specific of course, and you know yourself best. But I'd personally advice you to try to find a way to include your vices into your rituals, but conscientiously and in moderation, hopefully in a way that improves your overall life quality. (And eradicating the binging episodes seems like it would be an improvement).\n\nGood luck man",

For example, I know that if I sleep with my phone next to me I\u2019ll probably be up all night and not do anything productive the next day. So I won\u2019t negotiate with that. \n\nBut if it\u2019s 6pm, after a nap and some food, if I watch a show or YouTube in the lounge, or play some COD, I\u2019m more likely to get back to work after the time I set.\n\nIt takes practice and being willing to try again when you mess it up some days, but it gets better. \n\nLife feels more fun and fulfilling for me when I choose balance over perfection. Meditation also helps because it helps me recognize patterns of thought that usually lead to procrastination. (I did the \u201clabelling\u201d meditation course in the balance app and it gets easier to be in tune with my thoughts).\n\nLastly, when I find that I started of the day bad, I try not to say \u201cfuck it\u201d and recognize that I can still do some of the stuff I had wanted to do, even if I can no longer do everything. Like ending off the day with some exercise, or just a walk/stretch. Adding a meditation in and setting up for a good day tomorrow.\n\nAll this said I\u2019m not perfect and some weeks are better than others. Self compassion is key. I do feel overall that I\u2019ve ended up net positive without having as many of my \u201cself-sabotage\u201d days.",

I\u2019ve heard of people choosing a B day when they wake up feeling crappy and they just don\u2019t have the energy but they don\u2019t want to fall off the bandwagon and let themselves down, and some people schedule them in. Maybe consciously labelling those more chilled days as B days would help you categorise them in your head as just another part of your schedule so you don\u2019t feel as much guilt afterwards. You\u2019re not totally giving up on all your hard work, you\u2019re having designated downtime. Switching between the 2 can also be a novelty for someone who finds a strict routine really overwhelming and gets demotivated when they \u201cfail\u201d a day.",

That's rough.\r  \n\r  \nI totally respect therapy and props to anyone who gets help from a pro. But I believe, deep down, every one of us has the power to shake off our blues without popping pills from big pharma. Yeah, some folks might have an easier fight than others, but that doesn't mean you wave the white flag.\r  \n\r  \nIf you're spending days on end in bed, cut off from the world, it sounds like you're wrestling with more than just being a couch potato. Just remember: take it one day at a time. Keep a record. You might take a few weeks to chain together two or three good days. But if you hit a bad day, just restart the count. You'll get to double digits, then a whole month. Never let life keep you down, get back up and find your passion.\r  \n\r  \nFind something that lights you up, something that you can mold into your life's work. Something that keeps you awake with ideas and possibilities. Picture what success looks like for you and work out a game plan to get there. Stay focused and determined to reach that goal, no matter what gets thrown at you. Trust me, if you don't quit, the sky's the limit.\r  \n\r  \nMe? I'm at a point where I don't give a shit about anything that isn't moving me forward. I'm so deep in my obsession that it's keeping me up for days.

I go through very similar cycles and I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s because of drastic hormonal changes with my uterus cycle. If you are a person with a uterus try seeing if you can pinpoint behaviors with different phases of cycle so you can adjust your schedule accordingly. Theres lots of info out there about ideal things to get done during certain phases of the uterus cycle.\n\nIf you are a person sans uterus I think hormonal fluctuations would still apply. You might just have some other subtle factors that could be throwing it off (like a cheat meal every two weeks if you\u2019re on a restrictive diet or maybe you meet up with friends every two weeks and that throws you off).\n\nUnrelated to hormones it could also be that you\u2019re putting too many daily tasks on yourself and you\u2019re burning out. (I also do this a lot and have to remind myself that progress and life is a journey not a race.)\n\nFor immediate \u201cpit feeling\u201d relief, try doing just one or two things that have been on the back of your mind and you might start naturally falling back into your happy healthy routine!",

They overcompensate for what they'd normally eat with a very strict diet (every meal planned out to the gram of weight of every food). That leads to cravings, massive cravings. The smartest ones obv plan just enough restriction to not crave food luke that, but everyone else is stuck with either planned cheat days or even worse unplanned cheat days.\n\nIt's really easy to just eat what you want. The same way it's really easy to just do nothing.\n\nI'd advise you to find balance. Add days to your restrictive plans where you just don't plan anything, on purpose. No wake up time, no breakfast, no gym, no reading, no becoming a better person. It will not work long term, but it will give you time to figure out how to adjust your whole method to allow your mind to not desire the easy way out.\n\nThat's my opinion, maybe it's wrong if you have some specific mental condition, but I'm not qualified to diagnose you or give you professional advice with that.",

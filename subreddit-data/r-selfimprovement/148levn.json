    "postText": "I'm nearly in my second year of sixth form. All my life I have been bullied, and not by a singular person, either. It seemed the whole school loved to make fun of me. Worst of all, I decided to join the \"weird\" kids. I had a couple close friends but I recently lost one due to our built up tension. We were both at fault, I must admit.   \n\n\nI have one friend but she never goes out. She's allowed to but she decides to hide in her house all day and never come out. In our 3-4 years of friendship, she's only gone out of her house during the worst part of covid (except for school, of course). Plus, for someone who never goes out, she isn't active online either. I love her but she feels like an online friend.   \n\n\nThis ties to my chronic loneliness. It's a constant feeling of dread. I'm an extrovert and in the few times I've actually gone out and do things, they were the times of my life. However, I'm not social anymore. I feel like it's my fault. Surprisingly, nobody in my life has been committed to keep in touch with me. I try so hard to make online friends but I'm the always the one who has to message them first. It feels one sided and they never work. is it because I'm so dislikeable??  \n\n\nI'm full of self hatred and anxiety. It's the fucking worst. I need to have some advice. I can't deal with this anymore. I can't even focus on my studies so I'm living for nothing at the moment. It feels like there's no solutions. Discord always makes me feel like an outcast and that nobody wants to talk to me. I have no social clubs around where I live. Even if there were any, my social status is too low to create new friends. My only hope is university. How do I feel some temporary relief from the worst feeling ever. It's unending and I just need anybody who feels like a genuine friend.   \n\n\n  \nTL;DR I need advice on chronic loneliness as someone with poor social status and poor social circle",

            "comment": "Ok so first thing you should try to remember is that even if you have people around you its still possible to feel lonely. You need the right people around you. Remember your never on your own in life. Others feel the same or have been through the same stuff as you. \n\n1. Your still growing and your life is not set yet. Things will change and so will you. I am not the same person I was at 18, 21 or even 24. Heck I like myself a lot now and a lot of people do. Something I could never have seen happening in the past.\n\n2. You need to be confident. Trust me. When I was not confident people saw me as awkward and an easy target to make fun of. You sort of make yourself a target unfortunately. Pick something you can dedicate yourself to and you will start to believe in yourself. I couldnt even lift the barbell and now I look back and laugh at my progress. People comment on how ive changed and it feels good. \n\n3. Dont be upset and think everyone outside is the same as in your school. Be nice friendly and smile. Try to make small talk and take interest in others. People love to talk about themselves. Trust me ive made so many genuine connections just talking to people. You can reinvent yourself anyday anytime. Just stick to it.\n\n4. I never used to look after myself because i never thought i was worth it. When I look back its stupid. I always wanted to get my ear pierced but never had the confidence. Im going to do it because I want to and I dont care what people think or say. This is the most empowering feeling. I dress how I want to dress and I feel so good about myself.\n\nIf you ever need to vent you can message. Trust me venting helps.",

    "postText": "I'm a teenager and to be honest, I'm scared of life. Especially adulthood. Adulthood just seems like stress, bad experiences, and sadness. I don't really hear anyone having fun when it comes to adulthood. My teen life is already kinda rough so adulthood just sounds like it'll be hell. \n\nI don't really have a clue what I want to do. All I know is that it needs to make money. But every job just looks stressful and hard, so I feel like I'm stuck. I know some people say \"You have tons of time to figure that out\" but that's just not true. People expect you to do amazing things, and it only has gotten worse with social media where 2 years olds are graduating college. ( sarcasm but I think you understand ). I know people talk about freedom with adulthood, but that doesn't reallt excite or interests me ( hell, more freedom sounds worse because I wouldn't know what to do with it anyway )\n\nNothing about growing up sounds fun or interesting. I'm starting to wonder if I'm even capable of it, to the point where I've thought of suicide on multiple occasions. My parents expect me to do all these great things, but I just don't think I can...\n\nI just feel like I'm going to turn out a disappointment to everyone, which would destroy my already low self esteem.",

            "comment": "Life is scary. That doesn't mean it can't be great or meaningful. The challenges can actually give it meaning. If you were faced with decades of comfortable living you'd probably become obsessed with finding something challenging and scary to do.\n\nOther people's expectations and disappointing them will quickly become arbitrary when you have your own desires and life going. You'll be more concerned about disappointing yourself. As an adult if someone told me I disappointed them I'd say \"that must be hard for you, do you wanna talk about it?\"",

            "comment": "Of course adulthood comes with a ton of responsibility and there is nothing one can do about it. I'm sorry but that's the truth.\n\nI don't know your circumstances but for a job I suggest you to become an entrepreneur. Then it's only up to you and you're your own boss. It comes with a lot of work but you have lots of advantages compared to regular jobs.\n\nTo boost your self-esteem you have to do something you're genuenly proud of. For example you can build an aesthetic physique, be very good at a certain sport, get an unique style, learn social skills etc.\n\nAlso I suggest you watch some videos of Hamza on youtube (especially his mental health guide) and to join some self-improvement community in your area or worldwide.\n\nDon't ever give up come on you got this. Turn your life around rn",

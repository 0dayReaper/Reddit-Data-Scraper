    "postText": "Everyone daydreams or cooks up imaginary scenarios in their mind, right? I do too. It's just that, when I do, I sometimes blurt out random things inaudibly, like people won't even understand I'm speaking or something. I sometimes do say things out loud, but that's only 1-2 times and when I'm alone. I do it (blurting things inaudibly) a LOT, I mean A LOOOT. Probably more than 20 times a day. My mother on the other hand, does it only 1-2 times a day. One of my friends does it a lot too. My mom says I'm not normal. I had this habit from a very young age. I'm stressed and confused. Please guide me.",

I get irritated when my younger sister (she's literally 6 and I'm 15) disturbs me or pokes her nose into what I'm doing, I quickly lose patience and hit her hard in places I shouldn't (head, chest). My mother tells me not to do that but I just can't control my anger when that situation arises. What should I do",

    "postText": "I'm a little lost with myself right now so I'm sorry if I don't express myself in the best way possible.\n\nI (22F) recently got broken up with, it was a long relationship that we started in highschool and since this happened I've realized how I still live as if I were a 16yo. I don't mean it in a childish way but mostly as in a don't know anything about life kinda way. It's just now that I've noticed how I don't know the basics of being an adult and everyone keeps telling me that at the very least I know how being in a committed relationship is and that I have emotional intelligence. That's all, I mean being a supportive girlfriend didn't get me anywhere, I was dumped either way for another girl (sorry this last one got me ranting)\n\nIt's been a few months since I started trying to become a better version of myself but I really don't know what to do and I don't think I've gotten anywhere since then.\n\nI feel basically like a parasite, I've never had a job and it's so hard to get one when you have no experience, no connections, no family connections or anything to help you get started and the fact that my country is in one of its worst economic crises ever isn't helping. I'm not trying to sound like I'm too picky but I can't work for 150 dolars (at most) a month by spending from monday to saturday all day long in a place where I would get that only by commissions. I need time to study and go to class, I study engineering and classes are LONG. I've just recently been diagnosed with ADHD and I also need time to go to therapy and sich.\n\nMost of these things are something most learn when they're 18-19 and I'm so behind, my friends all have had multiple jobs and are finding their paths but I just lost mine and I want to get back on track.",

            "comment": "I feel like you're selling yourself short here. There's a few things that are really positive about your situation. One of them is that you're studying engineering. Once you finish that degree a huge amount of employment opportunities will open up to you- so it's really important that you focus on studying and doing as well as you can in that area.   \nSecondly, 3 years behind is actually not that long. You could be 30 and in this position (which, btw, is still fine). You have plenty of time to find a job, and as long as you are trying your best there is really nothing else you can do. So don't stress about it. \n\nIn terms of 'the basics of being an adult', what sorts of skills do you feel like you're lacking in?",

It's a joke around my house that we should all have some basic skill to survive the zombies (lol), so I learned how to cook pretty much anything, sew and knit, fix most stuff around the house, I know how to drive and basic med care. It's not so much as skills, maybe it's just the mentality, I was told I care too much and it sounds as if I was a child. I've noticed that since my break up I feel like a 15yo again, maybe it's because I feel lonely and out of place everywhere, or maybe it's just that my uni has a high school in the same building and I have to go through there everyday. It's just weird seeing most people my age moving out with their partners or graduating too. There's lots of things that make me feel like a failure now that I think about it, it feels like everyone is getting better and I'm just stuck in the same place I've been since 2019.",

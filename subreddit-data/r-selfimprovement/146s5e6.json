    "postText": "Since I was a young child I was constantly compared to others by my family and parents, im terms of behaviours, academics, achievements. I always felt like the failure I was potrayed as so I accepted and embraced it. \n\nFast forward now, im 27 M and really started focusing on self improvement in every aspect, I have come such a long way but subconsciously in the back of my mind I compare myself to others constantly and it holds me back. I compare my height to others (im relatively short (172cm)  in an averagly tall country), my looks, my social abilities, my education, my confidence, my communication skills.. the list goes on and on. But ultimately I project these insecurities on how others feel about me, mainly my girlfriend.. im sure she loves me for more than these things as I love her but this projection is always there which leads me to my core belief that I am not good enough.\n\nI understand social comparison is normal but my case is extreme and affects my self worth. How have others worked on this aspect of their life?",

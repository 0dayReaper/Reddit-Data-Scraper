    "postText": "Hello, everyone! \n\nI have recently started talking to a guy which is the opposite of the men that attract me on the emotional level. I did therapy in the past, but it seems that I\u2019m still into men who are avoidant and cold and hard to impress and get affection from.\n\nThis guy on the other hand, is very sweet and makes time for me, which sadly, makes me cringe. The thing that turned me off completely was when he said he doesn\u2019t want to watch a tv series he loves because he wanted to talk to me until i fell asleep. I felt as if someone is obsessing over me and suffocated. It\u2019s weird, because I always thought I was an anxious lover since I was always afraid of being alone and was craving affection from my partners, but never truly received it. Now, I find myself being on the avoidant/disorganized attachment style and I don\u2019t know how to navigate this. \n\nIs giving such attention normal or is it a red flag? I feel like I don\u2019t know what is normal anymore and I feel like totally closing myself, but I also want to grow and heal my emotional wounds so I haven\u2019t stopped talking to him.. .\n\nDid anyone go through something similar? Is it like a wall you have to break in order to reach real intimacy? \n\nThank you!",

When you see that externally, the same thing happens internally but for you, to you.  \n\nThis is why \u201cthey can only love you as much as they love themselves\u201d \n\nWhat are you hiding from yourself in the shadows? What is brought to the surface when someone shows you real attention and affection? \n\nMost likely it will be your own feeling of unworthiness for that love. \n\nHe might be your externalized \u201cunworthiness\u201d of love. \n\nIt\u2019s important to know that you are worthy of love and attention, and what the \u201ccringe\u201d really is is the discomfort that comes with admitting that to yourself, thus changing your identity.",

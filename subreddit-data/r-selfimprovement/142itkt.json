I used to be incredibly smart and quick minded growing up. But I also was raised by a mother who questioned everything so I have so much doubt posted in my mind mainly about myself and my appearance and intelligence. \n\nBut I constantly call myself stupid of dumb either if I dont get something right or when I make something more difficult than it needs to be. \n\nI constantly have so much trouble with this so how do I stop being do hard on myself?",

You are going to have to be patient with yourself.  Your bad habit was not formed overnight, so it will take time to replace it with a good habit.  You will forget to do this at times, so expect that to happen and don't beat yourself up about it.  \n\nFor inspiration, look for a copy of *Atomic Habits* by James Clear.",

It is doing way more harm than good and at this point I cry to myself wondering why I am always so seemingly oblivious.\n\nI am currently working on how I respond to things and how to not take everything to heart. When people tell me there is an easier way to do a certain thing I get so into my head because I feel I look so stupid. I have even been berated because I \"don't use \\[my\\] brain\"",

            "comment": "I've definitely had struggles with this! Perhaps most people on the planet are taught that in order to persuade or motivate yourself, you have to always use disparaging generalized character conclusions and labels. Sometimes we grow up in environments where we are not taught complex thinking and analysis of a scenario and instead of saying I have learned in the future I will do XYZ, I agonize with shame over how horrific and disgusting I l must be. A lot of religious influence contributes to this mindset Even if you didn't grow up in a religious environment, it still has seeped into popular culture. we are taught to angrily berate ourselves so that other people don't do it to us.  Other times we are taught that we have to be around people who villainize us so we might as well choose for ourselves the type of evil we will embody and express.\n\nI have mostly solved what used to be a dominating factor in my life, berating and demonizing myself, by removing myself from the presence of people who talk down to me. I realized I was talking down on myself as a way of expressing respect and affinity from the people I was around. The negative things they said about me, I would repeat to gain their acceptance, I thought I was impervious to internalizing it but over time I did internalize it. And it's taking a lot of time and effort to get out of it. The other part of disparaging myself, I solved by watching a lot of drag queen stuff and remembering the absurd humor in dramatically harping on about my flaws. \n\nAnd another thing that helped me was reminding myself that I tend to demonize myself when I am highly stressed, and for me a response to high stress is to get super in my mind and analytical to try to problem solve and predict and choose my behaviors, so since I'm super in my mind I forget an objective perspective where I recognize these are just thoughts I'm having and not realities. and so when this starts to happen I can just say oh hey this is a sign I am stressed and It's time to practice box breathing, or listening to music, or just changing up my surroundings and props and tasks and posture in some way that helps my mind realize that I am going into a different experience where a different mindset, mood, tone and expectations is possible. And I can do something that releases me from the endless feedback loop of reacting to my own reactions to thoughts that aren't even mine, but a reflection of things I have seen and heard.\n\nThat reminds me that It also helped me to learn a little bit about pure OCD. Sometimes persistence of negative thoughts can have an OCD component. Best wishes with your journey towards managing these negative thoughts. It's entirely possible, just be patient with your self and keep reminding yourself. You're doing the best you can given all of the resources and experiences you've had access to during your entire lifetime\n\n\nWe can't scapegoat and demonize ourselves because we are a product of our environments, and there are so many factors beyond our control that shape us into who and how we are. The things we do regret, we can learn from it and do better in the future. I think being dramatic with self-disparagement removes accountability because we are just going overboard on exaggeration instead of being very accurate, specific, sustainable, actionable changes that can be made. \n\nAnd it is also unproductive or even dangerous because it blurs the lines between what we should actually take accountability for, and what is not ours to shoulder, and this can mean it is easier for other people to use coercive means to persuade us to do things that might not actually be in our best interest.",

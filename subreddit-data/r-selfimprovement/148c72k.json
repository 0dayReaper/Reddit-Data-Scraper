Like I\u2019m barely passing at everything in life. I\u2019m not handsome, but not ugly. I\u2019m not smart, or dumb. I just feel like there\u2019s nothing unique or special about me in any way. Like I\u2019m a cheap knock off that just kinda alright. I feel bad at my job,my studies, I can\u2019t really make friends, I\u2019m not good with women or anything. I try really hard to better myself. I joined the military, I take college classes, I work out, I read (not as much as I should) philosophy books. At the end of the day I\u2019m lonely. There\u2019s no overarching narrative to my life. The more I go on the more I realize just how pointless it is. I\u2019m filled with insecurities because I know there\u2019s nothing I\u2019m good at. Does that make sense?",

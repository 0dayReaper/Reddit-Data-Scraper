Took me a long time to realize that my perspective was flawed and as lame as it sounds changing your mindset and the internal will do much more good than always chasing after the outer and feeling like the grass is greener on the other side.",

There is nuisance in every situation, and extreme ways of thinking tend to hurt those around you and yourself. \n\nIt might be worth moving to a new place if you can afford it because it is an opportunity to get a fresh new perspective to see if it is really your community is the problem. \n\n&gt; I'd have to depend on myself in every situation, But somehow I feel like I'd be happy going through adversities as long as it's just me. \n\nIt is hard to say for sure if you will really be happy if you go solo or if it is just a part of your coping strategy of blaming the world. You might want to test yourself first by trying to manage some sort of project all by yourself before you do a radical change, like moving out. \n\n&gt; will moving out really help or am I just immature and full of hate like my mother says?\n\nIf your family is actually holding you down, then it can be a game of back and forth blame, and moving out will definitely give you a better outside perspective on what is really happening.",

Yes, issues will follow you if they are internal, but putting yourself in an environment that you will thrive in and taking yourself out of one that is bad for you is not a stupid or na\u00efve idea.\n \nEdit: If you miss home or realize that you didn't *need* to leave, eventually, you can just go back. Sometimes you need perspective. Doesn't always work for everyone but oftentimes people will stay in a situation that's bad for them, nothing ever changes, and they have themselves to blame for never acting on it.",

After I moved out, my roommate was a terrible slob, even left the apartment, because \"I couldn't stand the mess when you weren't here to clean it up!\" After living with her we were no longer friends. \n\nI share that to say- if you are miserable where you are, a change in scenery might help. You will find that when you get there, (unless you have a roommate, and even if you do have a roommate) you will have to do whatever gets done. As to mindset, that's also up to you. You might actually have time to think about things differently and change things you don't like. \n\nIt will give you a chance to get some clarity. It may also help you appreciate peace and quiet without people telling you what to do. Good luck.",

You'll spend a lot of time and money moving far away, and then realize your life is basically the same and your current problems persist. You have to fix your inner situation to improve your exterior situation.\n\nMoving to a new city will always yield new opportunities and new relationships though, so I wouldn't say rule it out. Just be prepared to do the inner work on yourself first and foremost. Don't rely on a new environment to get you there.",

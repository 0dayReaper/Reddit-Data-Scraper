    "postText": "Hello guys!\n\nThis is a bit of a different post than normal.\nI work in a very small and competitive industry.\nEverybody speaks and so.\n\nRecently I had to spend an entire full week, 10+ hours with a very important client of mine, which is a very old school, guilt tripper and manipulator.\n\nI feel guilt and disappointed in myself because I felt manipulated to say stuff that is not me or what I sayed was adultered to sound worse and more dramatic that what really was.\n\nIt was a very extunating week, where I had to control everything I said.\n\nAs a young professional (under 30) and in general a people's pleaser, I find this somewhat recurring with people that are older, and only look at you as resource and try to manipulate you.\n\nAny tips on how to avoid getting manipulated so easily or to avoid commenting on topic that make me unconfortable.\n\nThank you",

            "comment": "Here are a few ideas:\n\n&gt; 1. **Set Boundaries**: This is crucial in any professional relationship. Determine what kind of behavior you're comfortable with and what crosses the line. Once you've established these boundaries, communicate them clearly when necessary.\n\n&gt; 2. **Practice Assertiveness**: Learning to assertively communicate your needs, thoughts, and feelings can help prevent manipulation. It involves expressing yourself effectively and standing up for your point of view, while also respecting the rights and beliefs of others.\n\n&gt; 3. **Rehearse Responses**: If there are common situations or comments where you feel manipulated, prepare and rehearse responses beforehand. This could be as simple as saying, \"I'd rather not discuss that,\" or, \"Let's focus on the task at hand.\"\n\n&gt; 4. **Delay Responses**: If someone is trying to manipulate you into a quick decision or statement, it's okay to say, \"I need some time to think about this,\" or, \"I'll get back to you on that.\" This gives you time to consider your response without pressure.\n\n&gt; 5. **Seek Support**: If you feel comfortable doing so, confide in a trusted colleague, mentor, or professional coach. They can offer advice, perspective, and strategies to handle manipulation.\n\n&gt; 6. **Understand It's Not Personal**: Often, manipulative people behave this way because of their own insecurities or issues, not because of anything you've done. Don't take their actions personally.\n\n&gt; 7. **Stay Calm**: Keeping your cool can help you stay clear-headed and focused. If you feel yourself getting upset or flustered, take a few deep breaths and refocus.",

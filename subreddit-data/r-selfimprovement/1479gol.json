    "postText": "Hello, hope u guys are having a good day\n\nI'm 16, and I've been hearing my whole life that I'm kind of emotionless. Nobody has ever told me that I was rude or mean, but everyone tells me things like, \"Are you okay? You look sad,\" all the time, even my parents and close friends. Several people have asked me if I'm autistic, if I have depression or anxiety, and things like that. In my head, I'm a very expressive person, but people tell me I'm as emotional as a tree trunk\n\nI've already tried to act more emotional and expressive, and it just makes me feel miserable and uncomfortable. But being myself also makes me feel miserable. I always have the feeling that I'm being rude and cold to everyone. How can I please people without forcing myself to have a different personality? I really don't know what im doing wrong to sound so cold to people\n\nThanks for listening to me, and sorry if there are any mistakes in my text. hope u have a good day",

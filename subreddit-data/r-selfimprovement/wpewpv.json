    "postText": "Due to the nature of this community, we get suicidal posts near daily. \n\nOur userbase has been extremely kind and gracious to these users, and I do think the kindness of this community has saved some lives. \n\nHowever, I've been dealing with suicidal users for about six years on this site, and it's gotten to the point that I feel like we need some guidelines for these threads. I'm going to start with a few things I've learned from experience, but I welcome feedback and anything the community can think of that can also become a guideline. \n\n1) There is no one-size-fits-all solution to suicide. If anything, robotic answers and a cookie cutter plan would convince a suicidal person that you don't actually care. \n\n\n2) You aren't going to logic someone out of a mindset they didn't logic themselves into. Suicide is inherently idiosyncratic and if you ask \"why\" or try to argue with them on the specifics, they're just going to repeat and reinforce the things that make them suicidal in the first place. You, hearing about this for the first time, cannot compete with them having repeated these things and thought about them every day for months. They will have an answer for every question, every bit of logic, almost anything you can say.  The answers won't necessarily be logically sound, but they will be very real to the person at the center of it all. It's like a court case, you're the defense and they're the prosecution, and you didn't even know you were a lawyer. There IS a defense (I've never run into any suicidal person that actually deserved to die, or had such a bad life as to give up on it) but you are not as prepared to find it as they are to argue against it. TL;DR, don't engage with them in an adversarial fashion. \n\n3) People are coming to the internet *because* they are nervous about talking about this in real life. Telling them to find real life resources is a good idea in some situations, but in others telling them to find a trusted friend, adult, doctor, teacher, therapist, etc, will backfire because they cannot bring themselves to talk face to face with someone.  However, in these cases, finding them resources to licensed professionals they can deal with, through a phone call or chat line, is something they'd be interested in, as long as it has no chance of intersecting with their real lives. \n\n4) This is considerably darker than the other ones, but if the person does fall into deeper despair and takes their own life, it is not your fault.  The metaphor I like to use is: there is someone who got into a car accident and ended up stuck in a car on a railroad crossing, and you see a train coming from half a mile away. You rush to the car and try to get the person, who is hurt and finds it hard to move, out of the car before the train hits it. If you get them out of the car and to safety, you still need to let professionals see the wounds, you're not going to solve the entire problem, just the one super dangerous part. If you *don't* get to the car in time and they get hit, it's not your fault, it's not their fault, it's not the train driver's fault.  I've seen several Reddit mods, over the years, develop their own serious mental health problems because of the suicidal users we have to deal with.  Just keep in mind that we're brave, kindly bystanders trying to help, we are not responsible for the whole situation. \n\n\nI also would like to compile a list of suicide help and chat/phone call resources that we could send to people (if the situation is appropriate).  I would like as many as you can find for the US, but also Reddit is becoming more and more international and I am very very short on international resources, or country specific resources. \n\nI also need a list of things I should exclude from the automod filters filtering out links. \n\n988 - US national suicide hotline number - note, this number is potentially going to cause a police and EMT response, which might be traumatic for someone who lives with family or otherwise would be traumatized. Think carefully, it's an amazing resource but it might also cause problems. \n\nConversely, 988 is not exclusive to suicidal people themselves, it is also a resource for people who want help with friends or family.  You do not have to be the suicidal person yourself to call.\n\n988lifeline.org - website for the same, with more resources\n\nhttps://blog.opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines/ - up to date suicide hotlines internationally\n\nhttps://bridgestonetires.com.ph/list-of-organizations-offering-free-counseling-online/ - Bizarre Bridgestone Tires list of mental health resources in the Philippines, which has helped me several times but I'm still amazed that the tire company is running this. I did buy Bridgestone the last time I got tires.",

            "comment": "As a recently retired psychologist who also identifies as a recovering suicidal (43 plus years suicide free), thank you for posting your well-constructed and articulated points. \n\nIn my professional and personal experience non-suicidals, though well-intentioned, may inadvertently do more harm than good as they prematurely attempt to explore the \u201cwhy\u201d (or \u201cwhys\u201d) that led a person to seriously contemplate suicide in their own attempt to \u201csolve\u201d the suicidal\u2019s problem(s). In my own experience and what I have found with those I\u2019ve worked with, people contemplate and attempt suicide simply because it seems the best solution at the moment with the information that is available at that time. Non-suicidals can often have significant struggles with this reality.\n\nEach and every time I contemplated and/or attempted it, I was convinced that it was the best solution to my situation. I am not convinced that such a process was (or is) \u201cirrational\u201d as you call it though this is not the forum for such a discussion. I would, however strongly suggest that it might be more adaptive to consider substituting the term \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d to describe that process and its arrived at solution. \n\nI have also read some reports that a 988 call may result in the suicidal becoming even more traumatized as calling this number (as I understand) can lead to the police and EMTs being summoned to the call\u2019s point of origin. When I was actively suicidal such a response would have been too overwhelming for me.",

They didn\u2019t need to pep talk me, just listened if I had something to say. They borrowed my insurance card called a mental hospital a couple hours away and registered me. They made dinner, picked up the apartment, stayed the night, made breakfast, and packed my suitcase. They wrote an email to the people in my life that needed to know I was going away. They became my emergency contact and answered any call or email for me. I was a wreck and pretty frozen and would never have made it to the hospital without their help.\n\nI was in the hospital for two weeks. Similar program. Everything taken care of (except more strict and less comfortable). There I started medications, participated in group therapy several times a day, started learning about mindfulness, DBT therapy, meditation, etc. at the end of my visit, the hospital helped set up outpatient care and a psychiatrist.\n\nI would say to anyone on the edge and having strong suicidal ideations to call a close friend or family member. Ask them to come over and help take care of you. Anyone who loves you will do this in a heartbeat. They don\u2019t want to lose you. Ask them to help in every way possible so you can focus on lowering your depression/anxiety. And if you think you need medical attention, ask your friend/family member to help as making these types of calls can be stressful.\n\nIf someone you know is suicidal and reaches out for help, this is the type of help that\u2019s most useful. Just take care of them. And listen if they want to talk. It\u2019s not about having the correct words of wisdom. It\u2019s triage and you\u2019re there just to keep them alive, not solve their long term issues.",

Otherwise, they *are* the resource you can talk to, they're much better than a phone line because they have the same training but know you better. I guarantee you they will not Baker Act you or anything solely on you saying you're having some suicidal thoughts. They know just as much as you do how much of a disruption that would be. I'm trying to remember where I saw this, but I think there are guidelines on this published by the CDC and NiH. \n\nThey're trained how to handle these situations, and much like anything else, it's better to tell the medical professional so they can catch it early and work on it. \n\nThe short term plan I usually talk with people about is usually how to get them to a therapist with minimal disruption to their lives.\n\n&gt; On the therapy services website it says if you're having thoughts of suicide to call 911 or a hotline. \n\nThis is actually a kind of interesting and scary mental phenomenon where people having panic attacks or other distress kind of lose higher mental processing.  They know they need help, so they call/look up the people who help them with their mental problems, because that's where their mind goes.  They literally forget they can call 911 because it's not really intuitive to most people to call 911 on themselves.  Also sometimes they'll call/look at the website and then shut down and give up on that because of panic.  So mental health services and phone lines *very* clearly make sure to remind these people, first thing they see, that they can call 911 if needed. \n\nThat line is incredibly important to have on the website but it definitely isn't directed at you. Much like the stuff above, it's for people in distress at that exact moment, not people like you who are having problems, but trying to work on them over time.",

People always say think of what it does to family blah blah blah. But think of the police, landlords, neighbors, etc. that respond to it. Is that fair? Would you want a dead body on your property?

While none of these points are new to me because I have been trained to handle such problems, I must say this post is completely true. \n\nAlso, what I remind myself of often is that when you yourself are going through tough times, don't try to help others because you can get emotionally burnt and might start feeling worse or begin hating life. And on good days, when you have the time, try to be a non-judgmental, good listener. Many people often say that they wish someone would at least be there for them to talk to, for them to feel heard and understood.",

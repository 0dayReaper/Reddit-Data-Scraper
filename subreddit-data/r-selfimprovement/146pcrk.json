    "postText": "Hi, fellow Redditors!\n\nAs I grow older, I've come to appreciate the significance of prioritising my mental health, particularly when life gets more eventful and stressful. I'm reaching out to all of you to find out what your daily mental health routines look like and how you've managed to stick to them. I'm hoping to gather some insights and suggestions to help me overcome the challenges I'm currently facing.\n\nPersonally, I struggle with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), which makes it difficult for me to commit to a routine and follow through with it. I tend to have an \"all or nothing\" mindset and a perfectionist streak that often gets in the way. Lately, I've found myself in a bit of a rut, feeling like I lack any hobbies or interests. The search for the \"perfect\" routine or hobby has consumed me for the past couple of years if I\u2019m being honest.\n\nUnfortunately, this obsession has caused some negative consequences in my life. I've gained weight, become addicted to my phone as I endlessly research and gather knowledge before making decisions. Sometimes, this process can last for weeks or even months, especially when it comes to deciding on things as I just procrastinate. I desperately need help in creating a routine that keeps me engaged and fulfilled, but also that suits my two different work shift patterns as well as my day off on Mondays when I find myself feeling lost and purposeless. \n\nI work from 08:00 - 17:00 on most days and from 11:00 - 20:00 on some days. The challenge I face is maintaining consistency and structure in my daily life, given the variation in my work hours. It becomes even more complicated when I have a day off on Mondays, where I often feel adrift without a clear purpose. I want to make the most of my time, improve my mental well-being, and engage in activities that bring me fulfillment.\n\nCurrently, during the week and on my days off, I find myself just going through the motions, particularly on the days when my partner is at work and I'm alone. I end up spending my time engaging in pointless activities that feed into my OCPD, such as excessive researching, obsessing, and constantly thinking about doing things without actually taking action.\nBefore I know it, the morning has slipped away, and it's already lunchtime. This is the same in the evening when I just get home from work and scroll on my phone all evening. \n\nSo, dear Redditors, I would greatly appreciate any advice, suggestions, or personal experiences you can share regarding your own mental health routines. How do you create a routine that you can stick to? How do you overcome the challenges of perfectionism or an \"all or nothing\" mindset? Have you successfully navigated similar situations and found ways to engage in meaningful activities? I'm open to any tips or recommendations, whether they involve mindfulness exercises, hobbies, self-care practices, or anything else that has helped you improve your mental well-being.\n\nThank you in advance for your support and insights.",

            "comment": "Create a schedule for the day the night before and stick to it. I used to just wing my day and would not end up getting anything done for the day, but with a schedule I got a clear vision of what I need to get done for the day and usually am able to finish a lot of things. When I have an upcoming busy week, I try to plan my whole week a week beforehand and follow the schedule I make.\n\nMental health wise, I try to stay away from my phone or computer, when I take breaks in-between my study hours/work hours and instead I spend time with family, take the dogs out for a walk, go to the gym, but if there really isn't anything to do I play video games for a short while. But honestly, just do anything you think is fun but try to take breaks where you're able to go outside or socialize with people.",

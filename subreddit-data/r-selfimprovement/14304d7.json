    "postText": "I'm 30f and have been isolated the past couple years. I've made a lot of progress towards getting my life stable and on track for a hopeful future. But I also have a long way to go compared to my goals. \n\nThe most crucial missing component is lack of friendships and mutually supportive relationships. I want to make friends with similar interests who I can talk about business or supportive mindset related subjects with and go to the gym with and learn about their interests. I love to learn and I'm a great listener. But I don't know how to find people. In the past I have made all of my friends because they were roommates, landlords, or co-workers and that doesn't fit into my current circumstances. I also haven't bought clothes for years and I feel very awkward because of my lack of clothes. I am having trouble deciding my identity and what clothes will let me accurately communicate to people who I am and my aspirations. I want to feel healthier and more confident by going to the gym, but I need to find an experienced friend for me to go with. I'm very tired from my unfortunate job delivering Amazon packages full-time and on my days off I just want to study (I'm a student) and rest watching TV. I'm working on getting a new job hopefully in the next few months. But I need to bring things into my life that increase my confidence in order to feel like I can present my best self towards potential employers. I want friends that can help me learn how to be more professional and become accustomed with professional culture. \n\nWhat do you recommend I do? It's great that I have goals and insight into my circumstance. I'm just overwhelmed and don't know where to start.",

The initial confidence may not be based on anything concrete and that\u2019s okay. \n\nHave you tried online communities related to your interests? Sometimes the ease of access provided in, say, a discord group for business is enough to give you that initial boost.",

So in my mind's eye I can picture myself as a sure and intentional person when I am trying intimidating new things. Thank you very much for your supportive and kind words.\n\nI haven't tried online communities except just for random occasional Reddit reading and posting. I do have a discord account but I haven't learned how to really use it. Are all discords invite only?",

It sounds like you\u2019ve identified some of the things you want to do, hobbies, interests, and that is a GREAT start. Now start doing them. First step for me has always been to put daily tasks on a white board to hold yourself accountable. \n\nI\u2019ve been growing myself out of a hole for maybe a decade now. It doesn\u2019t just pop on like a lightbulb one day but I can trace a line from where I was to where I am now. It\u2019s always two steps forward, one step back\u2026 sometimes two or three back but as long as you find your way once or twice you can do it again.\n\nFor me, my biggest struggle has been growing up bipolar. Once I \u201cfigured out\u201d how to be bipolar, and manage my moods (and the depression) life has been much easier. It\u2019s gotten me to be very regimented sometimes about how I take care of myself but that\u2019s okay. When I start to feel down I go back to the basics (like you\u2019re talking about), diet, sleep, exercise, hobbies, school\u2026 all things that help me stay grounded. THEN, friends will come. \n\nRemember, people love talking about themselves (I\u2019ve done it a bit here even), and if you can find a way to be GENUINELY interested in other people both people in the conversation will have their needs being met. And that\u2019s how my best friendships have formed.",

I actually got 2 whiteboards hoping to do something similar, but I end up writing more like essential reminders about bills and appointments and groceries and things like that, rather than tasks related to self-improvement.\n\nThank you for confirming that it is possible to get yourself out of the hole with consistent efforts. I love that idea that once you can figure the way to handle something once or twice then that knowledge is yours for life and it becomes easier.\n\nI'm glad people like yourself are examples of having successfully built yourself up and out of a hole. and you have a lot of insights. Sometimes things seem so irreversible but then I get in little moods where it's like. I see a window into a whole other way to filter my world, so thanks for being a finger pointing to that window if that makes any sense!",

Therapy is for all that. You can\u2019t focus on that type of stuff on a daily basis. It\u2019ll wear you out. Make notes on a google doc or in a journal relating to that big, meta stuff",

You are spot on that I'm at a point where all the work I've done is giving me a perspective of what new wants and new needs I have. I want so badly to keep becoming a person. I thought I would never be capable of becoming, I want to surprise myself and remind myself that life is not so predictable as I've thought.  Yes indeed.. I have overcome, but it definitely time to level up so that my dreams become accessible. That is a good point. Not to overthink, to keep it simple and enjoy the process and not get caught up in details. Thank you for the reminder to zoom out and see things simply. Thank you for taking the time to share your encouragement for me.",

Food, oxygen, house\n\nHowever, my own thoughts corrupt my quality of life and wellbeing. I think too much, often out of doing stuff that are important and meaningful to live a good life. Such as self-doubt, which inhibits me from doing work.\n\nI suppose, with age, as you get older, you are more exposed to the turmoils of life, accounting a more developed brain and greater responsibilities, which may be perceived as a burden. This is where you are required to become more independent and less reliant on someone else, depending on your state.\n\nAs a child, you focus more on the present because you are free from the worries of the future and pain of the past, but as an adult, your life is oriented a lot on the future and past, due to caring about stuff a lot more and the stuff we care, such as money, is the focus. And since we are aware that this is within our responsibility and we control how much, how quick we get these things, we feel more burdened. Whereas, as a child or when your younger, you dont have much of these responsibilities, so you focus on the present more.\n\nHowever, by balancing ones life, we can maintain this focus on the present.",

I constantly hear voices in my head telling me and making me feel like I did something wrong and I constantly look back on things I\u2019ve viewed in the past on my laptop to ensure I did nothing wrong and I constantly have dreams about social issues murder, rape, cancer, drowning, sexual predators, money etc.",

I don't know your history but I know what you're describing and it sounds like something the internet can't provide help for. \n\nI will say this much though, reaching out does take courage and if you're willing to put your faith in strangers online then you can put faith in yourself to talk with someone in person to work through everything. One thing that always helps me is if a loved one was going through what I am, what I would I tell that person? And then do that.",

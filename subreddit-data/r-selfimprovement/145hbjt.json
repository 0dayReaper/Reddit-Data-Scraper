    "postText": "Not so long ago I was studying really hard at school, up early to go to the gym 3 days a week and go kickboxing to other two. I was making some extra money on the side selling clothes, and eating good and i felt great. over the last few weeks I stopped trying to sell clothes, stopped getting up early. I go to the gym once or twice a week if it all now, and i still go to my kickboxing but with a different attitude than before. My meals are few and far between now and often just whatever I can afford. i haven\u2019t sold anything for weeks and my studying is pretty patchy to say the least. Now i feel like shit, and it\u2019s not the first time. before this I was in a similar situation: i was working hard as a gardener and tutor on the weekends, and I was doing really well at school. I was in the gym 3 times a week and kickboxing once a week and then it just all fell away and i was back to where I am now. I\u2019ve been through this more than twice and every time it all just falls apart and i\u2019m back to sitting around my house as soon as I get home or all weekend scrolling through my phone doing nothing useful and feeling like shit but for some reason it\u2019s when i\u2019m here that I cant seem to get myself up. I feel absolutely trapped in this negative feedback loop of as soon as things start going well i throw it all away.",

What\u2019s stopping you from maintaining it? \n\nIs it because you\u2019re doing too much? Maybe instead of balls to the walls, you do one less day of gym? I\u2019m not sure what the answer is - only you know. \n\nBut you need to look deeper and find the reason. \n\nOne thing, you should feel extremely positive about the fact that you even could enforce such rich and healthy lifestyles at all. So you know you\u2019re capable. \n\n- \n\nFor me personally, what really helped was figuring out that it\u2019s the challenge that is the rewarding part. Like you said, lazing around makes you feel like shit - so which do you prefer? \n\nIt\u2019s hard to get up and gym, to kickbox and to sell clothes - but it\u2019s even harder to realise you just fucked around all day. It\u2019ll be harder in 20 years when you look back. \n\nSo my advice - dig deeper and find why you\u2019re stopping. Then, try to enjoy the process. Lifestyles, like diets, don\u2019t work in spurts. It has to be maintainable. \n\nIt\u2019s a journey - and you\u2019re killing it thus far. Think of these down times as teachers for you - showing you what happens if you don\u2019t do what\u2019s best for you. You\u2019ve got this. \n\nHope it helps, \n\n\u2014 eren",

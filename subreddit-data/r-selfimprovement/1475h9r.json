Does anyone have any way I can stop myself from constantly thinking about this? It's been years and I don't want to be haunted forever.",

Every time you have one of these thoughts, try to firmly tell yourself \u201cthe reason I\u2019m having these thoughts is because I would not act like that now.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s hard to feel like someone out there may think badly of you, but it seems like the punishment is coming from inward, I.e you. If it was so bad to them, the punishment would more likely come from them.",

The fact that it is haunting you is great, it means you realize you did something wrong, and its even better that you have changed and are no longer the person who said those things. That said, your not going to forget overnight, but over time it will start to bother you less and less, and then one day you will realize it hasn't bothered you in forever.",

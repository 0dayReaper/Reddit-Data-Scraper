Have you been able to sit down and ask where this yearning and this magnetic pull comes from? Even if it\u2019s painful? It\u2019s hard to resolve a problem with the thinking that creates it, know? I think you need to tune into your heart and acknowledge yourself because there\u2019s so much more there. Like, \u201cwho would I be if I wasn\u2019t run by this behaviour?\u201d \u201cWho would I be if instead of chastising myself for these reactions (because that\u2019s what they are) what if I acknowledged that they are parts of me looking for attention, love?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s reframe the title here. You are actually already managing your habits! That\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re doing, know? But who would you be if you were no longer managing and you were free? What does that person feel like, how do they think, what do they need? \n\nTake it from a much worse (prior) addict than yourself. You\u2019ve motherfucking got this.",

            "comment": "It sounds like maybe anxiety is causing you to put off preparing for this important exam, which is a normal and understandable occurrence. A lot of people fall into procrastination for this reason. You absolutely can change your habits. Perhaps you just haven't found the right approach that works for you yet.\n\nSome things you could try:\n\n\\-Set a timer for 10-20 minutes (or however long or short you want to make this -- find your sweet spot) to work on preparing for your exam. After those 10 minutes, take a break for another 10 minutes (or however long you choose) to allow yourself to do things you want to do. After those 10 minutes, come back to study for another 10-20 minutes.\n\nThis can prevent the task from becoming overwhelming. It also gives you something to look forward to if you break it down into more manageable slices of time. Plus the more you see how much you are able to accomplish in just the 10-20 minutes, it will motivate you to accomplish more and perhaps cause you to increase the timer. You can readjust the times accordingly as you see fit. This is just a method that might help you get started.\n\n\\-To calm down your anxiety, try meditation. It's helpful to slow down your mind and get you in the right headspace that you need to focus on studying. Being in the right energy makes all the difference when it comes to accomplishing what we set out to do.",

It's our desires that leads us to create an opportunity we can grow from. For example, I like social media, I enjoy video games, I enjoy watching Tv, but I also enjoy learning, and volunteering, and spending time with my friends. \n\nSo, I balance my life to be able to do it all. Each and every day I live a balance life. So here is an example of my daily routine to show you create a habit. Habits take about 60 days to form. First, I wake up and read, do my class studies, then I eat breakfast, then I take a shower. My new habit that I am forming right now is taking a 3-minute cold shower after bathing.  Why am I doing this to push myself to grow, and it has health benefits. Then I go to work, I put my shift in, I go home and make dinner, then watch tv, or look at social media, or play video games. Then I go to bed. \n\nI do this 6 days a week there is 1 day that I just wake up and go about my day. I volunteer in the season with the same program I have been involved with for 6 years now. I keep learning and teaching lessons when that season starts. I take walks and get over 10000 steps in every day. So, the truth is how do you manage your time is by choosing what is most important to you. Then manage your time so you can enjoy all of it.",

And they're not very expensive, because they're not medical professionals, they're just professional organizers and accountability partners, which ain't rocket science, but they will add some serious value to getting you back in the saddle and on schedule for that entrance exam.  And obviously doing it all by yourself isn't working, and no book about habits is going to help if you don't have that weekly or bi-weekly accountability meeting.  And considering your obvious desperation to get out of this slump you're in what could you possibly have to lose by meeting with one for a consultation and seeing if it feels right for you, which it will, because they tend to be very nice and understanding people who find joy in the success of the people they help,so they're not taskmasters , they're your partner in success.  And if you want me to be your accountability partner to help you find one and make sure you follow through on that first consultation just PM me and I will be glad to help and I will do it for free and hang in there with you until we get the job done.",

    "postText": "You've been on self improvement for months, maybe even years. You want to get better but nothing ever works.  \nHere's why.  \nSelf improvement is an engine with 4 gears. Read, Practice, Reflect, Repeat.  \nIf you miss any of the gears, self improvement engine does not run.  \nMost of y'all only use one gear, you just read. You just watch a video. You just listen to a podcast.  \nBut you NEVER apply, you NEVER practice, you NEVER act.  \n\"I keep reading books on weight loss but I'm exactly the same weight!\"  \nPick one goal.  \nPick one book, one video, one podcast on the goal.  \nPick ONE thing to APPLY, then go DO that thing.  \nReflect on how it went.  \nReapply again but better now, or continue learning.\n\n  \nThis is how you actually self improve.",

I'll often reread parts of the book within this period.\n\nAfter 2-3 weeks of flashcards and review, the principles I read about will start bubbling up in day-to-day life - often in the exact moment that they're applicable.\n\nThen I start practicing. And after about 3 months, I start noticing the change. Those changes can keep happening for years after I read a book.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReading a book without an action follow-up is simply reading for entertainment. It won't change anything.",

If you don\u2019t associate with what you are reading or even recognize yourself in it, you might be missing whole teachings and practices that could be potentially life changing. \n\nBecome aware of limiting beliefs, and then take action to challenging them. \n\nYour advice is solid, I just wanted to note this too.",

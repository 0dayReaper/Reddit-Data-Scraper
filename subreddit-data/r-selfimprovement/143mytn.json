    "postText": "I having been using the pododmoro technique to boost up my productivity. But I lose track with my 5 min break activities, which i would require your suggestions.\n\nI often lose track of time doing my 5 min break activities which spiral into 15min to a couple of hours. I am trying to find activities which are only 5 min. \n\nI tried reading but an academic book would not give me the break I need and a novel i cannot read for just 5 mins if it gets intresting. Mobile browsing is even worse. Read internet telling me to make tea and clean. There is soo much tea you can drink and room you can clean\n \nIn my longer break i have tried watching just an episode of a series, which sometimes spirals to a few episodes. \n\nWhat do you people do for your 5min and 10min break activities and what would you suggest ?",

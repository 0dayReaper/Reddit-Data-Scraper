He\u2019s been going through significant health issues. I know that I have the strength of active listening. So, I make the choice to use this strength in this new commitment. That\u2019s self-discovery. It\u2019s a meaning to fulfill.\n\nIt may be like discovering a hidden gem within myself. At first, I may not have realized its worth or even known it existed. However, once I uncovered it, I saw how valuable and precious it was. I decided to polish and refine this gem, committing myself to learning and growing in this area. It was a meaningful choice, like investing in a treasure that had been hidden away for a long time. As I developed this strength, I found a meaning to fulfill and fulfilled it. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udcaa",

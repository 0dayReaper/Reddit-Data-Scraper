    "postText": "I\u2019ve been working in overcoming things like depression, anxiety, OCD for about 15 years now. In that time I\u2019ve learned the difficult lesson that some people are just not good for me and must be cut out in order for me to be able to live a mentally healthy life. Fortunately these people have been few and far between, but I have some friends &amp; family that are incredibly unhealthy people. For instance, I get my anxiety largely from my mom and we\u2019ve had discussions about unhealthy behaviors, but she always has an excuse of why she can\u2019t go to therapy or why she can\u2019t change her life.\n\nI know I don\u2019t have the power to make people do anything; they have to make the choice to change, but I\u2019m at a point where I really don\u2019t think I can keep these people in my life without that change. I don\u2019t want to get rid of every family member with a wayward political opinion, or a tiny carry-on of emotional baggage, but I feel like my mind is rotting when I\u2019m around these people. I love my family, but the more I overcome, the more I realize they\u2019re the problem.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this? If so, how so you handle it? And is there a way to encourage these family members to take initiative in sorting their own lives out?",

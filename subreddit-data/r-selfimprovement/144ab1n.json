    "postText": "\"Negative thinking? I thought that negative thoughts and feeling held no purpose, that they are just a glitch in our nature\" hear me out, in order to make optimal decisions, we need to take into account both the positive and negative. The duality of positive and negative is necessary. \n\nboredom is meant to motivate creativity.\r  \nanger is meant to motivate prevention.\r  \nanxiety is meant to motivate preparation.\r  \nsadness is meant to motivate reflection.\r  \nshame is meant to motivate introspection.\n\nThere exists short-term pain which leads to long-term happiness, in the same way there exist short-term pleasure that leads to long term suffering. A desire for distraction mostly arise from the fear of boredom. \n\nThe desire for distraction is also protected whenever you decide to ignore all the negative aspects of distraction and only focus on the short-term positive feelings you get. This is the danger in ignoring the negative and only thinking positive, you end up not taking the negative into consideration when making a decision, in that timeframe, you look at distraction as a good thing which is why you decide to do it.\n\nYou might think \"but I don't think that distraction is good for me!\" that might be true to some extent, but you are actively suppressing that knowledge whenever you are deciding to ignore \"negative thoughts and emotions.\n\nThe best way to stop desiring something negative such as distraction, is to look at it as what it is, a disgusting waste of time. This is why we should not suppress and ignore negative emotions, because they are meant to inform us of the negative aspects regarding a certain thing.",

This induces stress and leads to even more procrastination, in some kind of flight forward.\n\nNegative emotions should be tackled rather than ignored, yes. But I wouldn\u2019t recommend feeling them: people who need them already do, and it\u2019s one of the causes for which they burry their head in the sand.",

The problem is not the emotion itself but our own attempt to cope with it and deem it purposeless. \n\nThere are people who need these negative emotions so that they can deal with it before it becomes a storm and just because someone needs it doesn't mean they will feel it. This has to do with habitual coping mechanisms.\n\nSo I don't understand what you mean when you say \"But I wouldn't recommend feeling them\" because the main problem itself is that there are people who are suppressing and ignoring these emotions when you need to operate with these warning signs in mind. \n\nWe need to stop blaming emotions and rather see that the problem is our reaction and beliefs surrounding it.",

Have you considered meeting with an academic advisor or talking to your primary care doctor about what you\u2019re experiencing? There might be some helpful organizational strategies to keep track of tasks (such as using a checklist so you don\u2019t miss things), but if you\u2019re noticing this in lots of areas of your life, there might be something going on in the background. For example, things like ADHD or anxiety/depression can also mess with someone\u2019s concentration and ability to focus. Just a thought!",

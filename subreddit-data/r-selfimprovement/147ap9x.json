    "postText": "23 female. I cannot stop bursting into tears as of recently because of high-stress. I keep trying to read self improvement books but none really seem to hit the mark. I've been diagnosed with honestly everything under the sun and I don't really agree with any diagnosis. Within the last year I have been going through hell. My doctor told me I either have Lupus or Rheumatoid Arthritis and I have to wait to see, and I have been doing my final year of college. Since finding out about my health issues I felt like my adittude towards life has done a 180. I keep forgetting things, my anxiety has manifested into physical symptoms (chest and lung pain), I feel a lack of joy and have no motivation. I feel constantly overwhelmed despite not really having much going on, I feel empty, I feel numb and when I have a good day it is usually quickly soured by something as simple as dropping the remote. I will quickly burst into tears and cry for about 2 hours.  I'm quickly ruining all my relationships because I'm just so sensitive and miserable. I have tried mindfulness, i have tried postive thinking, i keep going through the motions, but at the slightest bit of inconvience or pain i well up with tears. I am functioning okay, but im not sure how to help my emotional state in this high stress time. I don't wanna loose my boyfriend or my friends. What do I so? Any advice?",

            "comment": "This sounds like you should perhaps look into mind body therapy which is a more holistic approach than traditional therapy. It\u2019s likely a lot of this originates from the mind, which if dealt with at the source can help the flow on effects down to the body (your pain and emotions). I recommend the book Don\u2019t Believe Everything You Think by Joseph Nguyen for a start. Then seeking mind body therapists in your area can help you get in touch with the deeper unconscious parts of yourself that are constantly trying to get your attention. It\u2019s a complex topic but since you\u2019re young these kinds of deeper changes can happen quicker than if you were eg 60. You may need to create a temporarily less stressful life so you can work on yourself for a bit then get back out there.",

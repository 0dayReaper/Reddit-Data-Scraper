I like seeing when other people are happy and appreciative when receiving it.\n\nBut for some odd reason, I don't appreciate it when gifts are given to me. Sometimes I put it aside and forget to even bring it with me as I go, and I sometimes even lose it, which of course hurts the gifter.\n\nI don't do it intentionally, I don't actively despise getting gifts, I just don't seem to respond much when I get them. I don't get particularly excited when getting them, however thoughtful they may be.\n\nI don't really know what could be wrong, but I would like to be appreciative and excited when I get things.",

            "comment": "I assume, getting gifts is not your love language. Sounds corny, I know, but there maybe something else you really need, and gifts won't make it up for the lack of it. \n\nAn example: a parent, that misses all your footy games, not  there for you, and then they would show up with a gift \u2013\u00a0of course, it is nice and thoughtful, but you already have enough of resentment at that point. And even if there's no resentment involved, you could benefit from better understanding, how you want to be loved.   \n\n\nAnyway, start of doing a love language test (it's free), and then let people in your life know that you better respond to supportive words, or quality time together than to gifts.",

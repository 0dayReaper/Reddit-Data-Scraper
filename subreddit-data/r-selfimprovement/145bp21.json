    "postText": "This has been my approach for the past 7-8 years now.\n\nI don't know how rock-bottom my confidence was vs other people, but it sure felt low.\n\nNow I'm confident all the time.\n\nHere's the recipe:\n\n1. Get good at learning.\n\nHere is the only learning technique I use: flash cards.\n\nI use an iPad. I split the screen between Kindle and Anki (flash card app). \n\nIf I see a piece of information that's worth knowing, I use the mic to create a flashcard. Goes fast af.\n\nThen I drill those cards. If you get the card right, you see it less often. If it's wrong, you see it more often.\n\nThis an excellent study practice, shamelessly stolen from learning experts. \n\n2. Get good at practice.\n\nYour attitude in practice matters a lot, so I'll cut to the chase:\n\nThe sole reason you practice is to create connections in your brain.\n\nThat means your job is to perform the task, observe the outcome, reflect, and repeat. \n\nIt doesn't matter if you fuck up 19/20 attempts. All that is is a reflection of where your neural connections currently are. Keep going.\n\n3. Start building competence in things that matter.\n\nTake note of where you struggle with confidence. Then take this practice and build counter-balancing skills. \n\nI struggled socially. \n\nApplying this technique to emotional intelligence gave me social ease - confidence in social situations.\n\nNow I'm learning social intelligence, so I can aquire rapport-building skills - the ability to effectively influence a social situation.\n\nMy success is an inevitable outcome of applying these techniques, because if you stimulate the brain to learn, it can't just *not* learn.\n\n\nThis will work for you, too, because we all work with more/less the same hardware. \n\nIf you can read this post, you have all the learning tools you need. You just gotta use them the right way.",

            "comment": "It's kinda ironic but there are studies that say the most confident people are incompetent. They don't know what they can do and can not do because of their incompetence and rather assume \"it's going to be easy\" compared of a professional. This leads to them likely bullshiting their way through society, and not rarely ending in a leader position because of that overly confident behaviour.",

You'll become more friendly and outgoing.\n\nYou might start picking up on 'challenger' vibes from men and flirtatious vibes from women. \n\nThat's kinda the first half of learning the social game - awareness.\n\nThe second half is learning to influence the interactions. That's what I'm into now.\n\nI only started the journey 1.5 years ago and I slept on Social Intelligence since the winter time. I kept meaning to study it and just got around to it lately.\n\nSo it could go a lot faster. Just follow the path I describe.",

Being very aware of all the little social things happening in someone you're interacting with is irritating as all fuck, and it puts the focus on them and what they like/perceive about you if you go too far. Learning social skills is still valuable but I dread the idea of analysing people even more than I already do",

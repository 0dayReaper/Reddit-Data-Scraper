Ever since covid, I have found myself being less fearful and being stronger than I was in previous years. Not that any of this had to do with covid affecting or changing my life....I just saw the time as a reflection of who I've been and what I need to change. \n\nIn regards to visiting your pen pal crush - \n\n&gt;He recommended I go visit my pen pal crush in another country. Imagine a shy guy with no relationship experience doing that? But I did it.\n\nMay I ask how long you knew her for, and how long you guys kept in touch before you finally met? I am currently in a similar situation....I, too, have a crush on a guy halfway around the world. We have been in contact for a few months. Not that I plan to meet him soon but I've started to think about it. He's a really nice guy and maybe just having a chance to meet him would be nice enough.\n\n*Edit to say Thanks if you decide to reply \ud83d\ude0a",

    "postText": "My confidence is pretty low at the moment because all my friends and co-workers go on dates with people. \n\nI do feel envious of them, however I\u2019m working towards to making myself more attractive as I look pretty hideous at the moment. Like I\u2019m going to the gym regularly and I\u2019ll be getting a hair transplant in a couple days here in turkey. A year later, I\u2019ll look much better and will probably use tinder and hinge to find dates.\n\nHowever, the point of this post is I have no dating experience. By that time I\u2019ll be 25 and it worries me that everyone by the age of 25 will have a lot of dating experience and will be entering a phase where they\u2019ll be dating for husbands and wives.\n\nWith my major lack of dating experience, will it be too late to enter the dating scene and  call it quits or not?",

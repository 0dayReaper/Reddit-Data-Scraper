You're more powerful than you'll ever know, so let go of the future, and fear, and focus on the needs of the present. One task at a time. Only. And you'll suddenly find you're finished. And above all, be kind to yourself and to others. Your words matter.",

Again at 17 mins. At 24 mins, I'm like, 'Damn... time's almost up!'.\n\nBut when that 30 mins hit, I let the clock keep running. I could quit at any time but I choose to keep going. Every single time. \n\nSame for yard work, studying, reading, whatever. I always go a little farther than intended.\n\nThat makes you tough, because what you often find is that you can go way farther than you thought. Bank enough of those experiences and you don't give up easy anymore.",

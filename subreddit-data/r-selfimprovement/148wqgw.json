    "postText": "I'm trying to improve my mind and for that I require lots of solitude. So I put myself in solitude a lot because it's so peaceful. No opinions of others, nothing polluting my mind with negativity, no expectations need to be met. Just me and my own thoughts.\n\nIve been studying my mind while I'm in solitude because  I never understood how I learn or how to learn when I was in academics.  My goal in life at the moment is mastering my mind! To where studying is basically a hobby I enjoy doing. So I can learn easily.\n\n I may be sacrificing my social life but it's too late now I have to keep going on with what I've been doing and that's mastering my mind. Having a family of my own, reproducing doesn't matter to me I just want to master my mind and hopefully when I know my mind well enough it won't be too late to go back and start a family.\n\nOf course on this journey to mastering the mind I had to understand the most important thing the mind or brain needs and that's an excellent fuel source. So I cooked and learned about diet and took care of my body to nourish my brain. I looked into stimulants and vitamins. The stimulants I use are caffeine, nicotine and those work great and make my mind feel fluid along with a simple clean cut diet of course. \n\nPeople don't understand the journey I'm on and I'm judged because I don't meet societies expectations of a successful 'man' is. It's somewhat of a journey to enlightenment type of deal.",

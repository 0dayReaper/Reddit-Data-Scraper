    "postText": "Every time I talk I just feel like I\u2019m being brushed over and no one cares about when I\u2019m speaking, even tho I do hang around with good people who probably do listen to me but why do I just always feel like I\u2019m not good enough for someone to listen to me. I\u2019ve never always felt it my whole life but I think that was because I was always the centre of attention it was something I loved and I was good at untill I\u2019d say 1-2 years ago. idk what happened but something just changed in me, I lost most of my friends, they just said I was turning weird then I started hanging around with others. I felt like I couldn\u2019t fit in I started changing up my personality to fit other people (I do that a lot with different people without even realising) but still I didn\u2019t feel good enough so I was just forcing and forcing upon it untill I just got sick of everything and stayed inside my house for a while only leaving to go to school. after a while I started to feel better I had gotten a hair cut from having really long hair and i guess it just made me feel new so for a few days, I finally felt like I know who I am, I didn\u2019t switch up for people and If someone had bad views of me I didn\u2019t care. even started talking to a girl who I\u2019m still talking to now. about 2 weeks ago I fucked up I took Xanax because I\u2019m just a fucking idiot and fucked everything up the one time I feel good I have to fuck it up every time and then it just reset like a loop I\u2019m feeling shittier then ever idk how to talk to this girl anymore. We still do talk and we are pretty much together but I just don\u2019t know how to act like myself and I\u2019m just sitting there not saying anything and I\u2019m just boring now. like I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m worthy to talk to her anymore i honestly can\u2019t talk to most without it feeling like just weird. when I talk to her my mind just goes blank and I\u2019d always say something stupid and makes me even worse. the fear of rejection and not getting peoples validity just takes over and I can\u2019t deal with it the worst part is that no one understands and I don\u2019t know how to explain it nor do I want to everything just goes to shit",

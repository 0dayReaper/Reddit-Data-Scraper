I feel good like I\u2019m taking a step in the right direction\u2026 fast forward and I just feel incredibly guilty. Like I overreacted or I could have handled situations differently. \n\nAny advice or words from people that have felt like that before?",

Give it time.  \n\nIt's OK to question if you could have handled something better, that's always part of the process.  But you'll get used to standing up for yourself if you do it consistently, and after a while you won't feel like you're being selfish or whatever.",

            "comment": "It sounds like maybe you feel guilty because you feel like you could have set your boundaries in a more calm and graceful way rather than becoming emotionally reactive. \n\nI think this is something that is normal when you're first learning to set boundaries. It takes time to find the right balance - to keep your calm and remain assertive and not aggressive when someone steps on one of your boundaries. \n\nFrom the other person's perspective, they may have not realize it was a boundary before you told them, and they may feel genuinely sorry and want to respect your boundaries. Every situation is so unique and different.",

But it\u2019s about what you need, and doing what you need for yourself, not someone else. \n\nAll I can say is it is difficult, and feeling guilty doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ve done anything wrong. It means you care &lt;3",

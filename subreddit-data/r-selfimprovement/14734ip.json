    "postText": "When I was 21 years old, I was a fit dude. In high school, one of my friends urged me to join the wrestling team. I was the fittest, most upbeat dude ever. I was very skinny, I had long  blonde hair, glasses very young looking, and since I was so young I could literally do anything with my life. \n\nYet, I was really confused. The moment I graduated high school, my brother went straight to university and majored in mechanical engineering. I was just fucking alone with my mom. I was so sad that my brother left me. In high school we were becoming besties. I didn't know what the hell I wanted in life. I would always go on social media and see all of my high school friends having fun. That's what I truly wanted in life was to just be that college frat boy. Or that dude that hangs out with his colleagues and stuff. \n\nI had no career or life guidance. My mom was studying her ass off to become a nurse and paid very little attention to me. I had to make myself food and whatnot. If I even said hi to her she would scream at me because she had to study. I took all of the education classes in community college. English, history, science, etc. My mom told me to take it slow, only take 3 classes at a time. I basically just took wrestling and swimming because I wanted to explore my hobbies. Then, I took the basic classes. \n\nThe thing was is at the time, I loved video games too much and I hardly ever studied. Skyrim was such a hit back then. I barely passed some of my classes mainly because I kept talking to this one girl on the phone from high school and such.\n\nI just remember how much potential I could have had with a family that could have motivated me to be something in life. I never had that. No one ever really cared. I just wish I had that small nudge of bit guidance somewhere. Because when I was 21 I was a good fit looking dude with a great personality. \n\nIf I can just talk to my younger self, I would've told him to work at Trader Joe's. I love working at TJs currently but being nearly 30 years of age makes me self conscious. With enough effort at 21 years of age, I easily could've got my first job there. I would've made some friends and got that work experience at a young age. Those were the things I actually valued at the time in my life. I remember constantly watching that Linkin Park music video numb. That was how I felt at the time. Working at Trader Joe's would've filled that gap and I would make friends who had these suggestions for what they did in college.\n\nInstead I wasted so many years in college. I studied programming (computer science), dropped out because I couldn't pass calculus 2, then studied psychology. Considering over the pandemic I was so isolated, I just feel like there have been so many wasted years.  A psychology degree won't get you anywhere in life I fear.",

Having goals for the future will help, but even focusing purely on the future will prevent you from taking advantage of the present moment. I promise that the more good you do for yourself in the present moment, the better your future will be. If you love wrestling and have the money, go to a wrestling/mma gym. Start taking little steps to get into better shape, whether that be running, weight lifting, or even just walking. Whatever you do, push yourself to improve every week or every month. Start putting money aside for a financial goal that you'd like. Try learning something new, and stick with it even though it's hard. In addition to this, don't be so hard on yourself. You've been fighting and moving forward, so you know you can do difficult things. Be proud of that! You will be okay.",

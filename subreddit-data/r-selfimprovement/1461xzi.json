    "postText": "I rarely used to leave the house, from childhood through college, outside of seeing my few friends and the occasional events family members hosted. As a former athlete and recent college graduate, I used to over-discipline myself to stay focused and avoid trouble. Throw social anxiety into the mix and you can see why I really never went outside my comfort zone much. \n\nBut now I\u2019m living in a new state all alone. It\u2019s still hard going out, but most weekends I force myself to do *something* that\u2019s not sitting in my bedroom or living room. It\u2019s helping me learn a lot about myself. I\u2019ve always liked fun activities but I never had the time or mindset to indulge in them. It\u2019s as if I\u2019ve been waiting on something the my whole life time, and now I\u2019m done waiting. Idk it just feels good to be active in life for the first time",

I went through a similar experience with you, and I found a big part of that is momentum functioning like a snowball down a hill. It feels great and keeps getting better, but if something stops that momentum abruptly you\u2019ll wish you knew how to get the ball rolling again. Social anxiety is a similar struggle for me, and the part I\u2019m constantly working on, but it\u2019s a skill to be learned. Socializing is a skill that takes practice, and the majority of the time you\u2019ll never see a lot of the people you interact with ever again, so what\u2019s the worry? (That\u2019s what I try to tell myself anyway). In stoicism there\u2019s also this idea that how bad you THINK something might be is usually dramatically different then how bad it actually is. If you try walking up and talking to someone new and it\u2019s a completely awkward and clunky interaction, you probably think it would be much more terrible than it actually would be. It\u2019s all practice and learning. Congrats on the momentum, sounds like you\u2019re discovering a new version of yourself, which is a great time.",

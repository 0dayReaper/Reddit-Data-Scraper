    "postText": "My dad could give me a very good idea related to my college work, and I'll be INTERNALLY (I don't act on any of these thoughts) like \"how can he have such an idea about 'my' work, which I couldn't even think of!! I'm useless.\"\n\nMy friend could say \"why do you slur your 'S's\" (I don't) and I would be in a breakdown testing my speech for hours and hours together to check if my speech is defective. \n\nAnyone could literally do something randomly and my feeling that I'm useless might be triggered. The horrible-est thing is I don't know when I'll be triggered. One thing for sure is I'm triggered more when I'm myself feeling low -\\_-. All this started mostly after certain incidents last year which made me feel very very inferior. \n\nDAE even relate!? What should I even do about this?",

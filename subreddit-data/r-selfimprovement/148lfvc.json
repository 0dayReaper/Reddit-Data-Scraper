She told me that she can no longer tolerate him being around her (even at work) as she increasingly finds him obnoxious and uncomfortable to be around. I am not sure what to do in this situation or whether I should do anything at all as I want to avoid judging her friend or giving bad advice.",

Homophobia, transphobia etc has led to inequality. \n\nAs a result of these beliefs, our rights are constantly in question. There are hundreds of anti LGBTQ laws waiting to be potentially be passed across the US. \n\nYes, anyone is allowed to be homophobic. However, you cannot be anti LGBTQ without being oppressive, or infringing upon the personal freedoms of others. You are harming others by having this belief. They aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.\n\nThe \u201chypocrisy\u201d is not equal when it is actually harmful to a marginalized group. \n\nIt will never be the same.\n\nEdit \n\nDo you feel like being pro LGBTQ is being forced upon people?",

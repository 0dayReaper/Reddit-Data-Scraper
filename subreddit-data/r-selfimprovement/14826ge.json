    "postText": "I\u2019m a 13 year old boy who was born with an undescended testicle. My left one descended correctly, however the right one had to be placed into the scrotum surgically when I was 3. I have noticed that the left one is rapidly growing while my right one has barely increased in size. My growth does not seem to be affected, as I have developed hair in those places, however I am not able to get a testosterone test and I really want to know if the rest of my life, gains in the gym and my ambition in life will be hindered from low testosterone.",

A lot of people don\u2019t realize how important developing properly through puberty is. Btw (something that may not be so obvious) but one testicle tends to hang lower in the scrotum than the other one.",

    "postText": "I'm in high school and there is this guy in my class, let's call him Guy. I wouldn't call Guy a bully he is more like an internet troll that thrives off negative interactions. So pretty much any interaction I have with Guy, he finds a way to be passive aggressive or laugh at me for the most normal things to make me feel bad.\n\nIf I react to this by insulting him or telling him shut the fuck up because he's a loser he sees that I'm \"mad\" and he continues because he feels like he won.\n\nBut if I don't react to it and just take it or I even react with kindness, he will think that I'm letting him walk over me. I know his kind, if someone let's him walk over them, he will keep walking over them.\n\nI've met countless people like this and I never knew how to deal with them because I can only react in these two ways. \n\nHow do I deal with people that act like this? And don't tell me to just never interact with them, that's not a solution, that's giving up. I don't believe that there are people you just can't have normal interactions with, there has to be a way.",

A friend taught me to respond to someone insulting me (or being passive-aggressive) with asking them \"Is everything okay? How are you really feeling today?\" they'll be taken aback and maybe (just maybe) will tell you a secret as to why they're the way they are...\n\nIf someone makes insulting jokes (or even racist/sexist ones) I like to ask them to explain to me why they think its funny, but not as in \"Why would you think thats funny, you dipshit?!\" but more like I just don't get it logically. Watch and enjoy, while they'll realize their mistake.\n\nIgnoring or distancing works, too. But that won't stop them from doing it to others.",

            "comment": "Well\u2026\n\nOk.  The right way to deal with it is by \u201cgrey rocking\u201d him.  You can google that, that\u2019s the advice I\u2019d offer.  It\u2019s a easy psychological approach to dealing with toxic people that really works long term and keeps you above it.\n\nBut if you feel compelled to throw caution to the wind and go toe to toe with a toxic person, here\u2019s my guide from years of experience!\n\nSo the thing about toxic people is they\u2019re very predictable.  That is the single good thing.  HOW they\u2019re toxic can be unpredictable and infuriating.  Some of them are just gifted at being shitty people.  But the pragmatic fact that they are toxic, and they will do toxic things, is what we\u2019re looking at first and foremost.  So step 1 is\u2026\n\n1.  Accept that you cannot change them.  All you can change is their desire to be toxic towards YOU specifically.\n\nAnd now the burning question\u2026 how do you do that?  It varies based on who the person is, who they like to target, and how/when they go about it.  There is no universal answer to this question\u2026. how to change their targeting of you.  But think on our single good thing.\n\nToxic people are predictable.  They LIKE to fuck with people.  Not just you, but anyone that they can get their little toxic jollies off on.  \n\nSo here\u2019s what you do.  This is a chess match now.  Grey rock them for awhile.  Not as a solution mind you, but as a strategy.  Eventually they will get bored and start fucking with someone else.  They can\u2019t help it, they\u2019re fucking toxic after all.  But you\u2019re not being weak, you\u2019re setting them up.  \n\nSo step 2:  grey rock and remove yourself.\n\nWhen they start fucking with someone else, befriend that person they\u2019re messing with.  Make a group of friends out of the people this person is fucking with, one by one.  Get a few on your side, and just wait for this idiot to fuck up.  Eventually they will go too far and get in trouble.  You\u2019re playing right into their hands by accepting their shit without going to an authority on it\u2026 eventually they will fuck with the wrong person and it will blow up in their face.  Sometimes this can take months\u2026 with one guy I had to wait YEARS.  \n\nAnd then, when they fuck up and they\u2019re fighting some battle with somebody else, or if you\u2019re lucky and they\u2019re in the hot seat for being shitty to someone, THATS when you hit them.  Hit them fucking hard.  Give them every goddamn ounce of the shit they gave you right back.  Yell and scream, threaten to fight them, or go fucking crazy and do whatever you\u2019d like.  Once I just slammed a bully\u2019s head into a brick wall.  In front of 25 classmates.  Not a single one backed his ass up, because by then they all fucking knew.\n\nSo step 3:  You wait until you have the advantage.  Once they\u2019re weak\u2026 once they went too far and they\u2019re in deep shit for something unrelated to you\u2026 once they have proven to every person possible that THEY are the problem\u2026 then it\u2019s check mate.  Take your shot and fucking end it.  Nobody will back that piece of shit up.\n\nCongrats!  You\u2019ve now wasted your energy on a toxic person, but can feel some semblance of self esteem.  I guess step 4 would be recognizing the futility in going toe to toe with a toxic piece of shit so you never waste your energy again, but fuck.  I\u2019m still working on that one.",

Now pick up your instrument and play a song you know by heart and do your best to concentrate on playing the song you have decided to play whilst the other song is playing in the background. As you get better at that, increase the volume of the other sound source. \n\nDont play an instrument? Try reading a book while playing loud ass WWE commentary in the background. You get the idea. \n\nThere's a muscle you are developing while doing this. You want your sense of focus on what YOU want to be focusing on to drown out the noise of whatever else is trying to grab your attention. \n\nI hope the analogy here is palpable. But really this is what you are doing when trying to avoid negativity in your life. Developing a sense of calm in the storm is the name of the game my friend.",

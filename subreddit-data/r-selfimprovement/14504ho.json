When you realize the other person can\u2019t hear you, that\u2019s when you walk away, or change the topic to something that is approached with more reciprocity. It\u2019s important to highlight similarities with others to increase rapport if you\u2019d like to change their perspective of you, which in turn would make them more open to actually hearing your opinion.",

From my understanding you can always engage when you decide to, so you\u2019re never not part of it. \n\nI doubt you talk 100% of the day, listening is part of being active in your own life, else what are you respond to. And again, talking is only one way to respond, \u201cactions are louder than words\u201d. \n\nSpeaking, like anything else, isn\u2019t inherently good or bad, and it can make your life better or worse. Learning *when* to speak and how are more important than just speaking. \n\nThink about the life lessons you\u2019ve learned, you\u2019re probably not quoting yourself. It\u2019s actually very rare we learn something new from hearing ourselves talk and that\u2019s only happening as a consequence of being out somewhere new by listening. \n\nI understand what you\u2019re saying in just trying to broaden it.",

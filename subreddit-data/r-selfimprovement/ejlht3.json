I'm talking about not showering for days and not remembering the last time I changed my clothes. I barely remember to eat and sleep and just generally dont take very good care of myself. My new years resolution was to do completely turn myself around and put in effort everyday to do something to present myself as a functioning adult. Today marks the third straight day in a row where I have brushed my teeth and I couldn't be more proud of myself!! There is only room for growth and I have nowhere to go but up. Cant wait to tackle 2020!",

Morning and evening habits are obvious.  I have a 'when I get to the office' and an 'when I get home' routine as well.  After that, add in 'easy simple goals', 'consistancy', and 'personal desire'  into it.",

Once I started forcing myself to do it at night for 5 nights, on the 6th night I couldn\u2019t go to sleep without it bc my mouth suddenly felt gross and now even when I get into bed without brushing, I have to get up every time bc my mouth just feels too gross to fall asleep.

But I made a checklist of little good habits I wanted to or needed to start up again. Brushing, flossing, and making my bed were the top three. I never saw the point of making my bed before because why bother? It's gonna get messed up again that night. But man has it helped. That and brushing/flossing in the morning, and I have three things checked off already. I've also found that by making my bed, it makes me want to tidy up other parts of my room too. It's also great because if I have a bad morning, I can still go back any time that day and make my bed or brush my teeth.\n\nI fucking love checklists. I try to make a list of ten things, half are daily things and half are based on that day. I aim for 8 most days. I feel you on the spiraling stuff. I need some sort of routine to keep it together, and this checklist has really helped me. They're just little things but they add up and it keeps me accountable to some extent.\n\nIf it helps, you can get a white board or just a piece of paper taped to the wall, and keep tally marks of how many times you've brushed your teeth that week/month/season",

The logic behind it is the following : in the evening, you don\u2019t want food residue to sit in your mouth for 10 hours or so (counting the time from your last meal in the evening until breakfast) so you always brush your teeth ; in the morning, especially if you have coffee, its better to brush your teeth immediately afterwards",

It praises you for entering your mood and activities every day, and if you forget and lose your steal, you can go back and enter the previous day's mood. That's really important for me because breaking a streak always results in \"what's the point\" kind of thinking. Of course, if you don't go the habit, you can't do it retroactively...\n\nThe paid version is well worth it. With any of these methods, I strongly suggest you only track 1-2 habits at once.",

It says to use it for 30 minutes but I always do a full hour. I wish I would've taken 'before' pictures but I was too excited to try them. On a typical teeth color scale I was always a 9-10 but im at a 4-5 now. I seriously never thought I would see the day i was confident in my teeth, but now I smile more and smile longer just to feel the sence of pride in my teeth. I know this sounds like something out of a commercial but I seriously cant give it enough praise. I think it's like $25-30 for 20 sets.",

With me it is getting up means take meds, meds means drink them with water, after drinking water brush teeth. And the water glass is right next to the sink where I brush my teeth. I go from my bed to where my meds are and take them with me into the bathroom. It's good to make things easier and combine them like that! I have to go the exact way anyway to go to the toilet because I have to pee anyway when I get up. You could even combine going to the toilet and brushing teeth, meaning you do your business while brushing. You sit there anyway.",

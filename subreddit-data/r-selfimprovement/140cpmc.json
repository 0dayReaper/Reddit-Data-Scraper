    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm not sure where to exactly post this so i'm posting here, hopefully I'll be able to get some good advice from others who were once in a simular postion to myself. For starters, i'm a 24 year old guy who has never properly been to the gym before. I've come up with the idea of buying a membership at my local gym and also booking some sessions with a PT so I can come up with a plan and to show me how to use the equipment. In terms of my build, i'm on the shorter side (5ft6) and i weigh roughly around 63.5 kilograms. I also have a fast metabolism and have always burnt weight off pretty quick. I've always been pretty self conscious about my build which has led to years of insecurities and social awkwardness. Now that i'm 24 and have the means to support myself, why not start today?\n\nIf anyone can offer advice for me that would be great. Feel free to ask questions too. \n\nThanks",

Find a routine you enjoy and stick with it for months. Muscle gain is slow, so don't be put off if you don't see results after a few weeks or months, just keep at it.\nSet a goal, like by your 25th birthday you want to start seeing some extra shape, or be able to lift X amount. But put the goal a fair time away.",

Just focus on progress and feeling good in your own skin.\r  \n\r  \nAs for advice, I'd suggest starting with realistic goals and staying consistent. Mix up your workouts to keep things interesting, and don't forget to fuel your body with nutritious food. And hey, if you want some extra motivation, check out the Forfeit app. It's this cool app where you gotta complete tasks and provide evidence, or else you lose money. You got this, my friend!",

A few years ago, this goal may of seemed a bit unrealistic as I didn't have the means of following it through, but now I got no more excuses so might as well give it a shot.",

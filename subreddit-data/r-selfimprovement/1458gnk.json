    "postText": "I have to go to therapy soon because my father suggested it. I struggle with severe anxiety and depression and suicidal thoughts, but I wasn't really too keen on the idea, to be honest. My father thought I should have some help because I was distracted and struggling to study at home. So, I moved out and began living on my own. Today, my father slapped me really hard and said, \"son, skip school this year, and When we meet next year, you should be better.\" \n\nI am skipping school because I need to focus on my mental health for a while. I will work out, go to therapy, and read novels, and I will ignore all the abusive teachers and principals who have hurt me in the past. When I'm ready, I'll go back to school, and it will be better because I will be stronger and will have more confidence in myself.",

            "comment": "This view is overly simplistic. If you remove yourself from people essentially, the vast majority of people get *worse* as a consequence. \n\nIt seems to make logical sense that if I\u2019m not well I recover then go back, but part of the recovery is going back, being in the environment we wish to get used to. \n\nNot only that but since your mental health is essential how you feel, it\u2019s going to be volatile and is not necessarily a dependable metric. \n\nI don\u2019t know your life but it could be the case that your views of seeing others as \u201cabusive\u201d might not be accurate because it seems to broad. For some people \u201cabusive\u201d is just a term for people they dislike. I\u2019m not asking you to qualify your views but we are biased and having a party trained in this is a helpful resource. \n\nDo you want competence or confidence? Competency is gained by doing the activity, confidence will fluctuate regardless of your activity. \n\nHow are you measuring \u201cstronger\u201d because it also seems undefined. We have a lot of words where we have a foggy idea of what it is but without metrics we often keep moving the goal post. \n\nI don\u2019t condone hitting people, it\u2019s not inherently conducive to listening but the sentiment that action is better then ill-suited preparation, especially when both can be done at the same time, might be a fair point. \n\nYou might be in this for the long haul, don\u2019t put your life on pause. You can communicate, if it\u2019s getting hard let your teachers know, they can help. Accommodations exist, extending exams, office hours, etc.",

                    "comment": "-It sounds to me like that's another way of saying you need to be exposed to difficult situations to overcome it because it gets easier every time. That does make sense. I think I can understand where you're coming from with that.\n\n\n-You shouldn't give up on trying and putting yourself out there to others and your studies.\n\n-But My teachers and principal throw countless insults at me. All day, every day, they slap me with their thick, black sticks. They abuse me in front of the whole school, mocking and making fun of my poor communication skills. I am terrified and I don't know what to do. I try to talk to them but it's like talking to a wall. I feel so helpless and it's driving me crazy. I just want the pain to stop. I am so tired of all this abuse.  Why do they keep doing this to me?\n\n-Everyone at school just acts so nice until they drive you to freaking kill yourself\n\n-I understand that my mental health is affecting my studies, and my father has suggested that I take a break from school and seek help through therapy. This does not mean that I will not study for the entire year; I will continue to study at home during a particular time.\n\n\nI will also continue to interact with others while I am attending therapy. The therapist can help me with social skills and provide me with resources to interact with others in a positive way. In addition to therapy, I will be going to the gym and interacting with others there, as this may also help me improve my social skills.\n\n\nWhile it may be challenging to do both at the same time, I believe that giving my mental health more priority is an important step towards my recovery. If I am able to recover quickly, I can return to school this year, and I will continue to make progress. I appreciate your insight and the perspective you have provided. Your advice is thoughtful and focused on my greater good. =)",

                            "comment": "Well given the context, which I didn\u2019t have before, sounds like a school with corporal punishment. Some schools still allow it even though other states have banned it entirely. Schools like that made my grandpa drop out. One day a woman was going to stick him and he caught the ruler and walked out. \n\nIn schools like that physically abuse is used as a way to \u201ccorrect\u201d behavior but it doesn\u2019t help the person learn the lesson or understanding what exactly to fix or how. \n\nI will say, most people aren\u2019t just \u201cacting nice\u201d, they probably are nice. It might be the case they just don\u2019t know that well, what to do in those situations, or you might be giving the impression that you don\u2019t want to be talked to. \n\nIt might be possible to find online programs or, if the school is that bad, transferring, or even trying to get a GED (it seems like you\u2019re in HS). \n\nI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve communicated this to your family, but given their physical response it seems they think it conducive to learning which is a shame. \n\nMany people think it builds character which is a poor assessment of what character is. At least with my assessment the use of violence is an admission that one can\u2019t communicate through something and is a sign of immaturity. Character in this case, as my grandpa had done, is drawing the boundary of how people are allowed to treat us. The other part of character is not desiring to retaliate to dish out what has been given. \n\nMost people see revenge as Justice when it isn\u2019t, if the same action is taken with the same intention, to cause harm, then there is no difference between them. If Justice and injustice are different then either the action must be different or the intention. We know we can take the same action and it can be just (self defense) so the actual difference is the intention, to preserve rather than harm. \n\nHowever backwards it seems these people think they\u2019re doing the right thing. That doesn\u2019t mean they are but that also means we don\u2019t need to hold animosity towards them. That also doesn\u2019t mean we allow it to occur. \n\nAs mentioned a change of schools might be a priority.",

    "postText": "I am 18 and my ex girlfriend is 18. We dated for about a year. We were both 17 at the time so we had a lot of growth in the time that we were together. It was our senior year, everything was going great until it wasn't. Towards the end of our relationship, I would make myself the victim without realizing it. I know now, and have reflected on what I can do better since then. We ended on relatively mutual terms however, I was really immature and have a lot of guilt and regret. I want to be able to move on from her but I find myself thinking about her more than I think I should.",

You\u2019re 18, you have an amazing life in front of you and you live and learn. See this past relationship as a lesson and find out what went wrong and try to make a change it in the future. You can\u2019t change the past so reminiscing about what could\u2019ve or should\u2019ve been is useless.",

One year of your life seems *so* significant right now doesn\u2019t it? Guess what? After you live a couple decades that one year becomes an instant of your life relative to its entirety. Don\u2019t waste your time. Go learn something. Try to make money. Learn an instrument. The list is endless. **Persevere through the frustration that is life and it will become clear to you.** That\u2019s how you find peace.",

Now she left, and that space is empty. You must fill it with yourself, fill it with your passion of work and improvement. What did she fulfill for you? Fulfill that for yourself. \n\nStop externalizing your desire and needs, do not wait for anyone or any external thing to fulfill what you feel within YOU. \n\nMost ppl that respond to this have not overcome it themselves. I have had to move on from relationships that meant the world to me, only to realize it\u2019s all just a story, and I am entirely whole by myself, without anyone to fulfill what I think I need.",

And all of you are right, a year is just a year. I have decades ahead of me and how I deal with this will help me better in the future. I cant waste any more time reminiscing about it as it will lead to nothing.",

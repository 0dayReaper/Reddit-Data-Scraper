When i was eating like shit, playing video games for 12 hours a day, fat, unemployed, and had a self-depricating/nihilistic personality no one said anything and it was fine. \n\nNow that I am going to the gym, doing BJJ, trying to eat high protein everyday, and practicing stoicism i am seen and looked at as if I am childish by others.  \n\nFor example, I've never drank alchohol, done any drugs, or go to clubs/parties (and never will) and people tell me that i eventually will or that i should \"grow up\" (whatever that means)\n\nAlso sometimes people even tell me that I'm rude or disrespectful simply because i don't react the way they expect me to (when I am just controlling my actions and reactions)\n\nI am genuinely curious as to why I'm looked at like i'm some sort of weirdo/alien and why self-improvement is synonymous with being childish.",

As a Canadian, I've been legal drinking age for 8 years here and only been drunk a few times. I think I've only been to one party in my life.\n\nPeople will never understand it but the important thing is that you're doing what makes you comfortable and I think it's honourable to be focusing on your health in this way when so many people at this age don't.",

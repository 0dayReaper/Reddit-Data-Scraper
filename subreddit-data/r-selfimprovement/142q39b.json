    "postText": "Procrastination is a common problem for many people, and it can be a difficult habit to break. Despite my best efforts, I find myself falling into this trap time and time again. I've tried all sorts of methods to try and overcome my procrastination, from setting deadlines to using productivity apps, but nothing seems to work. It's frustrating and disheartening, as I really want to improve myself, but somehow I always end up procrastinating so much that I lose myself. I'm reaching out to those who have dealt with or overcome this issue, as I'm tired of hearing the old adage \"just do it\". If you have any tips or strategies that have helped you beat procrastination, I would love to hear them.\r  \n\r  \nI feel like I have a clear understanding of what I want to improve in my life and I've set achievable goals for myself. However, I can't seem to shake off this feeling of being stuck and unmotivated. I've made plans that are simple and doable, but I can't help but wonder if my lack of progress is due to intrinsic laziness or some underlying fear that I haven't quite identified yet. It's frustrating not knowing the root cause of my behavior, but I know that I need to keep pushing and trying my best, even if progress is slow.\r  \n\r  \nI'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and could really use some assistance. I know that I can't solve every problem on my own, so any help that is offered is greatly appreciated. Whether it's a shoulder to lean on or some practical advice, I welcome any support that can help me move forward. So, I'm grateful to anyone who is willing to lend a hand and guide me through this challenging time. Thank you in advance for your support.",

            "comment": "The way I just related to this is insane. I used to be heavy into procrastinating, but I have some ways to get around it that might help you out. So here goes\u2026\n\nFirst, I\u2019m a Dopamine minimalist. Which means I don\u2019t do things that cause a lot of dopamine release like watching TV, playing the game, scrolling on my phone\u2014 stuff like that. I basically pretend like it\u2019s the 1800s and only do stuff people Did back then lmao\n\nMore Dopamine = more motivation = less procrastination\n\nNext I have clear rewards that I actually want, but can\u2019t do until I finish like 90 minutes of work\n\nSo I\u2019m a foodie and I LOVEE breakfast food. I love French toast, eggs, bacon.. ughh so much. I wake up excited to eat it BUT I don\u2019t let myself.\n\nThe work has to get done first. When I tell you, I be ON MY SHITS tryna get my stuff done so I can have breakfast, it\u2019s crazy. And I do this for everything\n\nThe only reason I work out is because I can\u2019t shower until I do.\n\nThe only reason I get back to work after breakfast is because I can\u2019t read my favorite books until I do.\n\nYou get the idea\n\nI can\u2019t think of anything else on the spot but if I do, I\u2019ll come back to This\n\nHope it helps",

            "comment": "Procrastination can be tough to overcome, here are a few strategies that might help:\r  \n\r\\- Break tasks into smaller, manageable steps: Sometimes, the sheer size of a task can be overwhelming and lead to procrastination. Break it down into smaller, actionable steps to make it feel more achievable.\r  \n\r\\- Use the \"two-minute rule\": If a task takes less than two minutes to complete, do it right away. It's a small commitment that can help you build momentum and overcome the initial hurdle of getting started.\r  \n\r\\- Find your optimal working environment: Experiment with different settings to see where you feel most focused and productive. It could be a quiet corner of your home, a local caf\u00e9, or a library\u2014wherever helps you minimize distractions and stay motivated.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, everyone's journey is unique, and it may take time to find what works best for you. And if you need an extra push to stay accountable, you can check out the Forfeit app. It's a cool tool that adds a bit of motivation by attaching a small monetary forfeit to tasks you want to complete.",

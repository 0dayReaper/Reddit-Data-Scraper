It angers me to know that she\u2019s having sex with this guy. Also, it makes me feel very sad that I wasted the last 6 years of my life. I could have improved myself to be an attractive man. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever find love being 24 years old rn. I feel absolutely crushed and hopeless to the point where I don\u2019t even want to wake up tomorrow",

I've found that I enjoy the process more than the rewards it accrues so I'm not longer working out to get hot.  I'm working out because I enjoy it. I'm not reading because I want to be well read but because I enjoy trying to break down literature.  I'm not getting certificates in AI and Full stack dev.  I just enjoy coding. \n\nStop doing everything for what someone else what's you to do.",

            "comment": "Start small. Work on making yourself feel better and be better today. Don't worry about where it all leads or make it this big thing. Do a few push ups or sit ups, go on a walk in nature, whatever you consider the bare minimum of fitness for yourself, just do that, then still do the walk in nature and just think about your problems, why they feel so big and if they are in fact that big. Take a nice hot shower and really clean up, hit all the crevices and wash your face. Eat something tasty but healthy, like a grilled chicken wrap, the new one from wendys is great, still get the fries if you want, it doesnt have to be all healthy. Do something you like just for you. \n\nJust doing those simple things will make you feel better TODAY. Right now. Don't make it this big self improvement journey. No its just trying to make yourself feel good today. Then if it goes well maybe we can try tomorrow",

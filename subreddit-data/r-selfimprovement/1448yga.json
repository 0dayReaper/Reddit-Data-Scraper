This isn\u2019t voluntary but if I don\u2019t have a plan for a plan, for a plan, for a plan, I feel immense anxiety.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to deal with life\u2019s blows other than trying to predict them and teaching myself how to handle them accordingly. I\u2019m fried. I\u2019m burnt out. \n\nMaybe this has to do with being neglected as a child but like, I\u2019m in therapy and taking medication. The medication has helped suicidality and I\u2019m not feeling as emotional any more, but I\u2019m still so overwhelmed. I just want to let all the baggage go and chill out. \n\nI just want to feel safe.",

            "comment": "The only safety you'll ever get in life comes from knowing that you can rely on yourself and your ability to deal with anything that comes up. Which is part learning to deal with any situation, and part your mentality. Naturally assuming that you can deal with anything that comes up.\n\nIt doesn't mean that you can handle anything perfectly. Nobody can. But you can deal with everything in a proper way. Even if it might cost you your life. If you can't prevent it, why fret over it? Will that help you in any way?\n\nWhat you need to realize is that this anxiety you're creating for yourself is killing you faster than most other things in life could. Most thing that could go wrong won't have nearly as much of an impact on you as what you are doing to yourself with this overthinking. So recognize how self destructive this behavior is and then choose to stop doing it. Learn to consciously decide what to focus on at all times. To remain in this state you're in would be insane and would mean that you enjoy suffering. And there's really no reason for it as all suffering is self generated. Through the way you interpret things.",

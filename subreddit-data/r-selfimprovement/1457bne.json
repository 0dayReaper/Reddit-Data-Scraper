    "postText": "Hello everyone if you got a few minutes please read my story, I\u2019ll appreciate it. Before we start a little about myself you would probably like to know, i am 18 years old i have been training martial arts and fitness for past few years,i have ocd, never drunk or smoked, healthy lifestyle fan. So let me stop wasting your time and let\u2019s get into the story: The last few months I was watching a lot of \u201cself improvement\u201d youtubers, millionaires etc.. and I\u2019ve been applying their methods in my life such as eating healthy working out 4-5 times per week reading more books, getting more sleep, which all worked great and for sure improved the quality of my life. But one day I came across this \u201cdopamine detox\u201d trend which I must say didn\u2019t work so well for me. As the days and weeks passed by I got into this trend and decided to delete mostly of my social media, very low to no screen time, just training and reading and reading and gaining knowledge, it has also inspired me to become a \u201cghost\u201d which these self improvement gurus say it\u2019s a crucial step for every masculine man to take in his life. So I stopped hanging out with friends completely(besides school), absolutely no communication with other people, to sum it up with few words, basically I took it so serious i gave my life to self improvement that led me nearly to a mental breakdown yesterday and 1 day after, here I am writing in panic, burning stomach, feeling like my whole body is shaking and shivers and that has been going on for a day now and i can not stop it no matter what I do. I\u2019m scared I will never be the way I was before. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so nervous for no reason before. If you came all the way through here i must say thank you for taking your time and reading my story\u2764\ufe0f",

Self improvement means meet new people, eat healthy, socialize more, buld strong connections, meet 1-2 times your acquaintances, love nature.\n\nWE HUMANS ARE SOCIAL ANIMALS.",

Try to breathe through it. They will pass, and you will regain your balance again. This experience has the potential to move you into a better place. It will teach your discernment.\n\nYou should never allow an influencer to replace your own inner guidance system. Always go inward to check if something resonates or not first. This is your power. Even feel free to discard anything I'm saying here if all of it or parts of it don't resonate with you.",

We\u2019re all different and different things work for us all. \n\nI\u2019m 26, but when I was 18 - I experienced many of these confusing moments. My advice to you is to zoom out a little bit. Your life will be fine - probably great. You\u2019re disciplined enough to be fit and healthy, you obviously have a desire to improve. In my 3rd person view - you\u2019re way ahead of where you \u2018should\u2019 be at that age. \n\nYou got this brother. \n\n- eren",

Before you were obsessed with self improvement, what did you like to do? Did you enjoy watching a movie? Playing a game? Try doing something you used to enjoy, let yourself unwind and don\u2019t allow yourself to feel guilty for it. We have dopamine receptors for a reason, to allow us to enjoy things, dopamine is not bad for you unless you turn something fun into an addiction and start to neglect other aspects of life for it. \n\nI wish I could be of more help, but please remember that self improvement is a small aspect of your life, don\u2019t let it be the be all and end all and it shouldn\u2019t eclipse the things you enjoy at a healthy level.",

You definitely started on the right track, but if you\u2019re taking advice from these crazy internet weirdos who are telling you to cut off all social media and human contact (when they literally make all their money on SM), you\u2019re doing it wrong. \n\nHumans are social creatures, and we all need hobbies and downtime. Any advice that tells you to dedicate yourself 100% to work and completing joyless tasks is wrong. Real self improvement will mean finding balance. Yes, doing more work, eating better, challenging your mind more, but it also means relaxing more and taking more time for self care, finding hobbies you love and that bring you joy, and cultivating relationships with people you care about by spending quality time with your friends and family. Any advice that isn\u2019t telling you how to make all of these things a healthy part of your life is just bad advice. Self-improvement isn\u2019t living like a monk, and anyone who\u2019d try to tell you it is is a grifter. \n\nI hope you take your time to heal and come back from this, and learn to find more reputable sources of life advice in the future!",

What are you going to do about it now?  \n\n\nThere's a character in a show called Twin Peaks called Dale Cooper. He says once every day give yourself a present. Don't plan on it, don't expect it. Just let it happen. It doesn't have to be something bad or harmful or glamorous. Just treat yourself with love.  \n\n\nEverything we do is in service of ourselves, our tribe, or our beliefs. If something doesn't serve you; abandon it. Self discipline serves you when it makes you better, but if you chastise yourself to the point of breaking it's no good.  \n\n\nIf you've been poisoned by toxic ideology what part of the ideology was the bad part? Identify it. Once you've recognized the pattern of toxic traits you can avoid spotting them again in the future. Find new beliefs that serve you better.  \n\n\nThe fact is you will never be the way you were before, you can never get back what you've lost. You can gain new things though. You haven't hit your physical or mental prime yet, and even when you do and start going downhill you can still learn new things and change yourself.",

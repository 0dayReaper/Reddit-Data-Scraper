Find activities that genuinely interest you, like learning a new skill, exploring a hobby, or setting personal goals.\r To stay motivated and accountable, try using the Forfeit app. It's this cool app where you risk losing some money if you don't complete a task and provide evidence. It adds a bit of fun and consequences to keep you on track.\r Remember, you don't need others to validate your interests. Embrace being your own person and enjoy the freedom to pursue what makes you happy and helps you improve. So go out there, rock your solo adventures, and become the best version of yourself!",

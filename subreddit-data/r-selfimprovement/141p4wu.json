    "postText": "Whatever the opposite of charisma is, I have it. I\u2019ve been treated like I was disgusting my whole life, and it was always so hard to make friends. Today, I don\u2019t get actively picked on, and people aren\u2019t nasty anymore, they just avoid acknowledging me unless they ABSOLUTELY have to.  Making friends is too rare and difficult to be worth the effort right now. \n\nOnly problem is, I can\u2019t improve my social anxiety or social skills if no one ever wants to talk to me in the first place. Most people don\u2019t seem to relate as they can walk into most rooms and instantly find people to talk to. I can count on one hand the amount of times this has happened. If that makes me a loser, so be it. \n\nAll I know is it\u2019s not a personality issue because I never get the chance to talk to them. I\u2019m not intimidating, plenty of intimidating people have no trouble making friends, and if I\u2019m really ugly, I guess I can\u2019t see it, so I have no clue what to improve on. \n\nY\u2019all are just gonna have to take me at my word that I\u2019m not some lazy neckbeard who sits on his ass, not doing anything with his life. I do everything right but people feel disgust when they see me.",

So I would instead call yourself \"unapproachable\" instead. Being \"ugly\" shouldn't make you unapproachable. Most people who aren't looking to date probably enjoy talking to a bunch of people.\n\nSo what happens when you approach someone and start talking to them? Do they recoil and run away? What are you saying to them? In what situation?",

For example lets say you struggle more then your peers at getting into a right sized job but your Autistic so statistics themselves are the cause of your issue and there is literally nothing you can do about that or ever will be able to do about that but hey at least you know the root of the issue. In contrast not knowing what the issue is may actually be far less demoralizing even if it ends up being the same root cause of the issue.  \n\nFor context I have alexithymia and it undermines 100% of my success both based on my experience and statistics so I know fixing that fixes my issue. Turns out theoretically the best I can do is lesson the influence of the alexithymia I can never fully remove it so I can never fully solve my issues In my case I was far more optimistic before I learned what the issue was so this is something worth considering.\n\nI am a strong advocate towards unrestricted access to information but I am also an advocate of picking ones battles carefully so the real question is whether or not this is a question you really want answered because there is about a 50% likelihood it is something you can do nothing about as that is typically the case with perceptual shortcomings.",

If I\u2019m watching tv at home, while driving or just talking to someone at work. This is energy draining for some people. A few find it funny but I think most people get tired of it.

Although its probably your body language: closed body language, resting b face, hunched over etc. \n\nAn easy way to practice your social skills is whenever you go to a shop or restaurant, just being nice to the employees, asking how they are, making jokes if you see an opportunity. Think about \"what can I do for others?\" instead of how people can like YOU. That'll make you more generally positive so you won't really need any specific 'tricks' to make other enjoy your company.",

This is because you and anyone who's trying to have a conversation with a complete stranger, is going \"out of your way\" to talk with someone. The only way to improve social skills is by socializing. Not a single human born on this planet who is considered good at talking with other people was born with this skill. No one is born with communication skills. Even singers, and they're the ones who are considered to be born with the gift of their voice, when they have to go out and practice. I think what you're struggling with is understanding non verbal cues. You need to understand who wants to be approached and who doesn't. Talk to cashiers, they are usually paid to be nice to people. Also, keep in mind that in order for people to like you and remember you, you have to make them feel special about themselves. If you make them feel great about themselves, they will naturally like you back. Just make sure to do it authentically.",

            "comment": "I think there is something physical that is potentially offputting. My bet is either a) smell b) something about your sense of style c) posture. I used to struggle with the same thing in high school. I've noticed that now that my style &amp; fitness is pretty decent and garners compliments, I have a self-fulfilling cycle of people giving me compliments which is helping with my posture as well.\n\nFor smell, try to make sure you're showering as much as is healthy. Find some nice perfumes/colognes as well -  Zara is amazing for this. Change out of your nice clothes as soon as you get home so you can mitigate how much you have to wash them, but wash them if you need to.\n\nFollow a few good fashion influencers for your gender. If they look like you, even better. This does not have to be expensive (but it can be). Emphasize nice shoes/jackets/coats/ belts - you can save on jeans and tees/ button ups to a certain degree. Find out what colors look good on your coloring. If you live in a big city, consignment stores for designer clothing can be helpful. Zara has made their business off of making current styling easy for both genders. (I know I sound like a Zara shill, but it is a good place to go for some pieces/things considering how I don't know your budget).\n\nA combo of yoga, walking and light weight lifting/pilates helped me with fitness, but I'm not my fittest. I get a lot more compliments being somewhat fit + very stylish versus my fittest + medium stylish.  This has impacted my confidence significantly. If you have time, try the 75 hard program.\n\nDress as well as you can without significantly overdressing for the occasion. I wore a black tank with dramatic organza sleeves and a pair of wide leg linen palazzo pants to run random errands in my mid-sized southeast town - I got infinite compliments and I'm a woman of color. It's ok to overdress a little, as long as you don't look like you are trying to get robbed. It helps you walk taller and feel good.\n\nIts easier to improve from the outside in versus the inside out. It is also better to make a few small improvements in all these areas (start walking or yoga, get a nice pair of sneakers, get a nice perfume), than to do one specific area overhaul and become obsessed with fitness or fashion or notes of perfume. I'm ADHD so I am prone to overhauling one specific area of my life to the point I'm obsessed with it, but its honestly better to make small improvements in all areas and see the benefits accrue slowly. \n\nEdit: moisturize! Neutrogena hydroboost is fire.\n\nAlso, try to make eye contact with people and smile at them before approaching. Wait to see if smiles are returned warmly and people look like they want to talk. If you don't get enthusiastic smiles, keep it moving.",

If it is, maybe that's your first problem - How do I become a more confident person.\n\nSecondly, please stop with the self-pity. It's a toxic cycle and I suspect that influences the body language that you put out to the world. If you have a sense of self and appreciation, your body language will show an element of confidence and you will be a better version of yourself than yesterday.\n\n&gt;Y\u2019all are just gonna have to take me at my word that I\u2019m not some lazy neckbeard who sits on his ass, not doing anything with his life.

Why do you people owe you a conversation in the first place? What value are you bringing in their lives? \n\nHalf this post reeks of entitlement and the expectation that people should come to you to help your social skills. Unfortunately, most people are not that generous with their time as you probably can tell. So, you will need to be a go getter and force your social skills to happen.

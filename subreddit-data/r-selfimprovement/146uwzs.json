I never compared myself to other peoples lives, never cared what other people are doing with their lives, I just lived in my own little bubble and focused on MY life, my family + friends. It\u2019s really nice not having social media, no one knows what you\u2019re doing and honestly I love that feeling lol. However I want to start being a content creator.. I already have a YouTube channel and have uploaded a couple videos but took a 5 year break but now I want to start uploading again and making videos but I feel like I need IG to make content and promote it as well. How do I deal with this? I don\u2019t want to have social media but I need it lol.",

I have social media but don't use it and or give it out usually...\n\nI think an option would be to make social media pages that exist for your channel and the content on them tailored to the channel. If you're going to try to be a content creator it's going to be tough if you only exist in one place.",

Then, break it, and you free yourself completely.\n\nWhat to do instead of going back to instant gratification:\n\nWhenever you feel any unpleasant sensation within you (e.g., you are disappointed by something or you feel anxious about everything on your to-do list), **RAIN**\n\n1. **Recognize** it (is it anxiety? is it stress? Where in your body do you feel it the most?)\n2. **Accept** it (the feeling is already within you; trying to distract yourself from it or trying to reject it is only going to make you suffer more---you don't have to keep doing this to yourself. Peace is *beneath* the pain within you. Peace is not outside of you)\n3. **Investigate. Listen** to it (ask it: \"What are you trying to tell me? What do you need the most right now?\"). Then *listen* as if you were listening for a top-secret message being whispered by a tiny kitten (listen with utmost care, attention, and Love for yourself)\n4. **Nurture** it (love yourself through the pain. Remind yourself of what you are capable of doing. Remind yourself that if you *don't* know what to do, you can always seek help. Just love yourself here, however feels most healing to you)\n\nHappy international month of peace! \u2764\ufe0f",

My suggestion: do what serves you and who you want to be, not what makes you feel good in the moment. We know something doesn't serve us if, after we do it, we feel bored, empty, or like we're lacking something.\n\nNeed to recharge? Want to meditate? Learn? Build a skill? Read? Practice? Study? Create? Brainstorm? Enjoy art? Meet new people? Enjoy the outdoors? Try new things? Breathing exercises? Journaling? Writing?\n\nIt all comes down to recognizing your options and choosing from there. Not sure where to start? Give something a chance for a couple weeks or even a month (it usually takes us a bit to get into the groove of things and figure out if we really enjoy that activity and if it serves us).\n\nHope that helps!",

Crazy times.\n\nHedge Funds tried to short it out of existence during the pandemic when nobody was going to the movies.   Retail investors (ie. average person investing in stock market) decided to fight back and purchased the stock, making it impossible for HF's to complete their kill.  We (retail investors) now own over 90% of all shares, making it impossible for HF's to cover.\n\nThis week the CEO of AMC just played 3-D chess after earning on 8/4/22 and is offering all retail investors with \"real shares\" a share of  a newly created \"Ape\" stock (only those with real shares can get the free Ape stock) for every share they already own of AMC.   (The community refers to itself as AMC Apes).   This should help in finally getting a true share count, likely exposing HF dark pool actiivty and could create the perfect storm for sending AMC shares thru the roof in the coming weeks.  (Not suggestion of making a buy, just watch this stock for a master class.)\n\nLot to share, but all very clearly learned by following AMCStock group.    This is where I learned everything about the stock market, and corruption at the hands of the \"money makers.\"   It's where I got my start and the community is super helpful.   Also look into CLOV (health care).\n\nNever a dull moment.\n\nP.S.- Never purchase a stock without understanding what you are doing and why you are doing it. Many great books on the subject.  Many great Twitter feeds that are super informative and helpful.  Best of luck!",

Trying to understand the stock market in a deeper way is a black hole of wasted effort, imo.",

Some pointers (I've been doing this on myself and coaching/guiding people through this for years now):\n\n* Identify the trigger to the best of your abilities. Is there something that consistently makes you feel anxious? What specifically triggers you to seek food for comfort? (For example: My trigger for watching porn was feeling intense loneliness whenever I was alone at night on the weekend)\n* What do you want to do instead of comforting yourself with food? (Again, be as specific as possible) (Same personal example: I wanted to build the habit of mindfulness and Self-power, so I chose to sit/breathe mindfully instead of indulging my cravings)\n* Lastly, what is your reason for wanting to replace this habit? This is your main motivator and will make it much easier to build this habit. (For me, it was wanting to remove the distraction---porn---so that I could solve the main problem: that I was deeply unhappy with myself)\n\nSomething to remember is that it typically takes 21-90 days to build a habit (depending on your Why). Everything I've shared with you here and in this post has helped me and many others to completely quit things like porn, weed, and comfort eating in just a few weeks.\n\nAnother piece of advice: Stick to at most two habits. Anything more and you're going to quickly burn yourself out and go back to your old ways (trust me on this one. Stubbornness is my Achilles' heel and I learned this the hard way)\n\nHope that helps!\n\nDM me if you feel stuck :)",

My homework was to barter myself down from instant gratification.\n\nFast food is a way for me to feel a quick glimpse of warmth and peace. I\u2019m trading that with porn right now. My therapist told me to get a vibrator. Mainly because porn is not my addiction, I could care less (I\u2019m a woman and porn is not meant to stimulate my brain) but it\u2019s a way to get a good dopamine rush without the calories. After porn, I\u2019ll deal myself down to a movie, which also releases dopamine, then down and down forth.",

Meditation helps you learn to slow down and use your body's own rhythms as a source of comfort. Therapy gives you a place to talk things out with a helpful human to really unearth root causes, and they can teach you (and guide your practice of) strategies like RAIN.

There are some common ones (crying, scrolling, alcohol) but it can be anything. Google pulled up some resources (I can't share links on this sub) including a nice one from \"choosing therapy.\"\n\nA related idea is a \"functional behavioral assessment\" this is something that usually happens in schools or other formal contexts. An observer will come in and observe the subjects \"antecedents, behavior, and consequences.\" This can reveal more complex avoidant behaviors. Not something you can do by yourself really but the idea of thinking about antecedents and consequences can be helpful.\n\nSkillful and unskillful behavior are definitely terms I learned from my therapist. I think that it's a term from Buddhist thought. We usually use it as \"unskillful behavior\" is old habits or strategies you developed as a child (so they might not work anymore, or work poorly). And unskillful behavior is reactionary instead of mindful. On the other hand, skillful behavior is something that you've learned to do as an adult, and usually involves a mindfulness component (or rather mindfulness is what helps you recognize and develop the skillful behavior). In simpler terms unskillful behaviors are things you're trying to stop and skillful behaviors are things you want to do more. I think Google will get you some further reading that is based on Buddhist thought.\n\nHope this is helpful!",

You cannot at once feel raging anger and warm joy. So if you feel anxious or tense (for example) you may do a relaxation technique such as deep breathing or think of a funny memory. \n\nDissolving an emotion means holding it in your awareness. Its labeling it. It's amazing how simply calling a negative emotion what it is - saying \"hello anger\" or \"hello anxiety\" - can make the intense emotion dissipate. \n\nHarnessing an emotion is using it intelligently. Let's say you're feeling depressed about your job (hypothetically). That could just be a useless negative emotion OR it could be useful information. Your body and subconscious are telling you you need to change. So harnessing is not unleashing a strong emotion or letting it control you, but rather investigating it and using it to motivate practical change.",

Saying it forces us to shift back into our conscious selves, snapping us out of whatever trance we might be in at the moment. \n\nIt's a lot like what happens when we read, \"Are you slouching?\" Immediately we become conscious of any slouching or straining of our neck forward/downward. Awareness/witnessing ourselves is enough to get us to want to do something to resolve it (just like awareness helps us to harness the emotion). What is best for us is done almost automatically when we shift into this state of mind.\n\nIt's all about shifting mental states like you said---it's all about shifting consciousness. It's all about shifting your perspective from being the emotion to being the *witness* of the emotion. What happens next is a conscious decision of what you're going to do with the emotion, how you choose to harness it, as you said.\n\nThank you again for sharing, you've genuinely helped me learn a lot.",

I don't really get a sense of gratification from games, I just have fun with it and have fun experiencing different stories. Usually what I do if I'm stressed is i think through it or talk to someone about it and then they usually make me feel better about it and I'm not that anxious or stressed anymore. And then after its all good I might listen to music or play video games or spend time with people I love. Thats why its really important having someone to talk to. Even if its a therapist or a family member irl or on facetime. Like I said I physically cant use video games to distract me from my anxiety because whenever i have in the past I get bored quickly and still feel shitty. So its best to talk through whatever youre going through and then once you feel better then go enjoy video games. If you cant talk to anyone I reccomend journaling. I know i know but it helps much more than you might think.\n\nAlso anyone who says that videogames are a waste of time. Literally everything else is a waste of time. We are on thia earth to just fuck around, you could spend all your time working at a factory being miserable and when you die nothing matters. Just enjoy life, however that is for you. I like to play games I like movies and tv. Am I a loser? I also like to go on walks with my friends and family and talk and spend time with them. I like to discuss things with them. They are so fucking important to me. Just because someone plays alot of video games doesnt mean its the only thing they do. I feel like its better to play games for 5 hours a day then to play it for 2 hours but using them as a mechanism to try and supress their feelings of stress and anxiety.",

What should I change?\nExercise, eat better, make friends. I do these things but I never feel a change. I always feel exhausted by myself and my inability to appreciate who I am.\nI really understand why people choose suicide when they feel consumed by these emotions and perspectives. While I  would appreciate ending this suffering for myself and others, I know I don't have the balls to follow through.\nI find myself yearning for validation and appreciation of others. I feel a desire to ask people for hugs and affection, often. I believe I was never taught as a child, how to navigate emotions and love myself. Instead my self-love was created through my interactions with others. \n\nHow do people break this cycle? How do people overcome the crippling lack of self love?",

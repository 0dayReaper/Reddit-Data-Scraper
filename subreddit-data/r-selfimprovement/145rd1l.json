            "comment": "Well, you don't have to be. That might be news to you but it's true. You can be however you want and you can think whatever you want. And your past traumas, while valid, do not need to define who you are in this moment. \n\nMy advice would be to try this. Whenever you have a very negative or pessimistic thought, follow it up with the exact opposite. An example: you might think to yourself \"the weather is absolute shit today, I hate when it rains.\" Follow that up with \"the weather is wonderful today, I love the rain because it makes everything green and helps the environment stay healthy.\" Just example, but this could help you change your mode of thinking from negative to positive and start to see the good in things.\n\nAs far as expectations go, you may be giving yourself too much credit for your psychic abilities. You don't know what's going to happen. Neither do I. Neither does anyone else. Anything could happen. So just... Let it happen. Your predictions will only serve to make you feel anxious and negative about things that haven't even taken place yet. That's needless. So you could try to drop your negative expectations. You don't necessarily need to replace them with positive expectations. It's okay to not have expectations and just go with the flow. It's the most honest approach to life really.\n\nSo yeah, just know that you can change and the first step is wanting to change which you obviously do. I wish you the best.",

            "comment": "I recommend making a daily gratification list. It can be things that happened today, yesterday or your oldest memories. It can be just one thing or a million. This has helped me a lot. In 2012 I lost my 2nd son the day he was born, he was full term, his only moments of life were him being unsuccessfully aggressively resuscitated. I already had a crib and nursery set up in my 2 and a half year old sons room who is my only child to this day. My 2nd son had trisomy 18 and never would\u2019ve seen his 1st birthday. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have to watch him suffer for a year, and also my oldest son who is autistic didn\u2019t have to share a room with a dying baby for a year. It was not easy to find something to be grateful about from that situation. My oldest just graduated middle school and is moving onto high school and is very socially out going. I think if he had experienced the traumatic death of a sibling as a toddler he would not be so well adjusted. Not everything horrible is as bad as it could\u2019ve been either. I recently heard some one say \u201crejection is just re-direction\u201d. Try to think of all the bad things that has happened as good from a different point of view. I know this is very difficult to do with some painful memories but I wish you luck in your healing process!",

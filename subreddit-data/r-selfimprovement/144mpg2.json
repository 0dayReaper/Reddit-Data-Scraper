    "postText": "Jim Fortin, a self-proclaimed subconscious transformation coach, and his associates James Wedmore and Kathrin Zenkina and how it all ties back to a Shaman. It has come to my attention that they are operating what appears to be an MLM marketing scheme under the guise of transformational coaching programs and podcasts.Jim Fortin, known as the host of the Jim Fortin Podcast and the creator of the Transformational Coaching Program (TCP), initially presents himself as a leader in subconscious reprogramming. However, it has become evident that a significant portion of his teachings and success stories are attributed to a shaman named DX, whom nobody in the program ever gets to meet, but he publicly mentions him ANY MINUTE. It took me 3 years to wake up and realize what was going on, I have been in this work for years until i had an epiphany. The programs and courses offered by Fortin, Wedmore, and Zenkina all seem to lead back to this mysterious figure, DX, or require participants to donate and tithe to DX.\n\nPlease go through each of these and listen carefully, this is what he just shares with the public, when you're in the program he literally talks about this shaman like he's a god.\n\nSource:\u00a0\n\nSource\n\nSource:\u00a0\n\nSource:\n\nSource:\n\n manifestation babes mention of this Shaman with Brandon Lucero ep #223 it's titled infusing spirituality into business done deep shamanic work from a male perspective Brandon Lucero\n\nIt's a wild story about his brother. I verified through Google for it to be true, but something about the story is VERY OFF. Listeners are too deep in the spiritual world to even question this.) In this transcript he goes by DON his names are DX - DON XAVIER, DX, but his real name is DON JAVIER. I also have records of all these videos in the program through Facebook that I can share)I was a member of Jim Fortin's TCP. Initially, the program appeared intriguing, promising subconscious insights derived from DX's teachings. However, it soon became apparent that the program was designed as a cycle of joining more programs and upsells. I eventually ended up joining a program director working with DX, but to my disappointment, it was Jim Fortin's sister, Mandy, who led the group. Don Javier, the elusive shaman, remained inaccessible, with Mandy reciting his teachings through video calls once a week. No pictures or videos are ever shown. We were told we would be more in contact with him if we did his program, not happening.\n\n Once you are in the KODEX group ( DX's program) What was initially presented as a transformative journey into expanded consciousness and connection with the Earth gradually revealed itself to be a cult-like environment. Students were indoctrinated with a set of rules and restrictions, such as the mandatory candle ceremony in your bedroom, purportedly to protect our energy and avoid attracting negative spirits. Restriction of travel to certain countries and participation in events with large crowds were also discouraged. Making sure to buy crystals and certain knick-knacks to protect your energy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe financial aspect of these programs is particularly alarming. The pricing for courses, consultations, and donations go up every year. Students are made to believe that the only way to grow and improve is by continuously engaging in these programs. The tactics employed to overcome objections during the sales process, known as \"slide-offs,\" further manipulate individuals into making financial commitments.Additionally, the leaders involved, including Jim Fortin, James Wedmore, and Kathrin Zenkina, create a narrative that positions DX as the appointed one, suggesting that any success experienced by participants is due to his energetic work behind the scenes. I can give you all the pricing information and receipts of this work. Another BIG RED FLAG with everything is the encouragement of something they called AYNI - \"what you have in prosperity is a reflection of your prosperity consciousness and your consciousness determines to what degree you serve others.\" Jim Fortin talks about this idea, then this leads to once you get to DX's program - he and his wife MANIPULATE YOU WITH AINI.   \n\n\nTHEN JIM KEEPS SAYING THIS SHAMAN IS SO HARD TO WORK WITH - doesn't have any social meida, or anything and has a contact wait of 2 years BUT THEN HAS A LINK TO WORK WITH HIM MYSTERIOUSLY IN HIS CONTACT PAGE. YOU CAN GET ON THAT LIST AND WAIT TWO YEARS BUT IF YOU USE AINI OR Tithing whatever you can give to DX, you get GET ONTop of what you pay to get into the membership!! Or if you want to work with DX -the shaman,image.png\n\n  \n.Then you can pay a donation to \"MOVE UP THE LIST\" i have sources where he said this.. This insinuation instills a belief that failure to adhere to the program or fall out of alignment with Fortin's teachings can bring havoc into one's life. Consequently, students like myself were manipulated into fully embracing this belief, surrendering our critical thinking and autonomy\n\n.Personally, I have invested a significant amount of money, approximately $15,000 to $20,000 in the past 3 years or so, in Jim's programs. While initially providing some benefits, it has become clear that the true purpose behind these teachings is to extract more money from vulnerable individuals. They tie you into a year-long program and use manipulation tactics to get you back or make sure you're healing or self-improvement isn't done. \n\nThere are reports of people spending even larger sums and becoming deeply entangled in this manipulation. \n\nWhat it comes down to - is they all get a cut off this, Katherine talks about DX and is almost like an affiliate for his work as she is for James, you can check the site and she promotes his Business by Design Program. Jim talks about DX and the goal is to get those super intrigued to be in this \"shaman's program\" after TCP and then he gets a cut, as well as James Wedmore. T**his is all leads back to DX, a guy you never hear, see, or know from, and that's the mystique and marketing behind it. You get to this deep rabbit hole and realize either Jim and all his associates are severely brainwashed by this man we never know of, or they are all in on it.**\n\nHope that by exposing this MLM marketing scheme and the manipulative tactics employed by Jim Fortin, James Wedmore, and Kathrin Zenkina, we can prevent others from falling victim to their deceptive practices. It is crucial to raise awareness about the exploitation of vulnerable individuals who seek personal growth and transformation.I have alot of data and videos AND LINKS to the sources i have in the body if you want to learn more or verify!

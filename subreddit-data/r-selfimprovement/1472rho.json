    "postText": "In the last few months, up to the end of 2021 to be honest, I had a rollercoster ride behind me.\nConnected with a girl while being in a relationship of 6 years, feeling the new spark, ending this relationship in a blitz.\n\nAfter the first shock for the both of us, we had the most special time for 2 weeks - each evening was talking, crying, talking, crying. It felt so deep. It WAS deep.\n\nThen we parted ways. Kept in touch for a few months but it ended in mid 2022. All the while I was with the new girl. Still am.\nChanged my job to a much better one - less stress. \nI can't stop wishing for my ex to be with me, to see the difference this job would have made to our relationship.\n\nNow I am moving in with the new girl. While having these thoughts in my mind and looking at old pictures of us fooling around at home. \n\nI realized... What I, what you, what we as people need is not more and more things (which I was aiming for for so long) - it's to have a connection. A real connection. \n\nDon't squander it like I did. Fight for it, live for it. Feel it.\n\nThe past is in the past now and I can never turn back the time - and I have to force myself to be open for this new relationship. It takes time to build depth.\n\nNever do a mistake like this. Don't break up because of a new spark you just discovered - take your time and talk with your partner. TALK, LISTEN, FEEL.\n\nI wish you a good evening. I certainly won't have one.",

I wish I had been more attentive to the thoughts and ideas of my woman instead of acting like a captain on a cruise boat and being more in touch with wanting to make sure she was completely happy. Now her new life has knocked me completely out the picture cause Im sure she's over me. We taught each other so much so I know she thinks of us every now and then. One day she might act on it.",

Im on a lifetime ban from my chance but I do pray and wish you the best on yours. .long as they are sexually attracted to you then your chances are high. My ex lost physical and sexual attraction to me long ago. Stand firm, and in the words of my 3yr old  hold your head up daddy and stop crying, it's coming. God said it. Lol. She is so amazing. But I say to you. If you really want it, it will happen on your end. The power of the universe will provide it.",

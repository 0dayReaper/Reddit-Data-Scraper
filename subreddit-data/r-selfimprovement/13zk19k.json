    "postText": "I was given an 11 months on a 10 year sentence for a drug accommodation charge 2 years ago. I\u2019m serving the remainder of my sentence on work release, meaning I leave the jail 6 days a week to go to work and then come back in the evening. It\u2019s becoming increasingly more difficult to stay motivated, not depressed, stay focused, get in a few workouts a week, have a decent diet, even practice regular hygiene honestly. \nI only have a few more months left but I feel like this has put such a halt to my progress that I\u2019ve made in my sobriety, health, fitness, financial health, I mean everything. I can\u2019t remember the last time I genuinely smiled without it feeling forced or rehearsed. \nAside from doing push-ups all day and reading books, what else could you do to improve this situation?\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that I have a lot of negativity surrounding me in the area I live when I get release. And that I have no option to relocate considering I don\u2019t have a degree or marketable skills to translate to another city.",

Just so you can get out of where you\u2019re staying.Now you\u2019re record might be a obstacle so you have to look around.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m currently 24M working as a Business Analyst and making $90k with bonuses. I think it\u2019s a decent amount but my parents are concerned I\u2019m not making enough and are urging me to quickly apply to grad school so I can make more money. The thing is, I have no idea what interests me enough to get a degree in and I\u2019m not sure how to find what my interests are. I\u2019m kinda liking what I\u2019m doing now and I like all the free time I have.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m very slow to make decisions and I feel like I\u2019m wasting my 20\u2019s not taking career risks, trying new things, going to grad school, etc and not sure how and where to start. \n\nMy work ethic is also horrible. I always finish things by the deadline and haven\u2019t gotten any complains about my work ethic or anything but on slower days, I have gone without doing a single bit of work and I feel horrible about it (fully remote btw). I just don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m wasting my youth being lazy and not living up to my potential. I know this is all over the place.\n\nOutside of work, I\u2019m pretty motivated and consistent in the things I enjoy doing (working out, art, volleyball, reading, social life). When I have a goal I\u2019m genuinely interested in, I keep at it consistently until I achieve it. For some reason, it\u2019s not translating to my career development. Not sure if anyone has any advice but anything would be greatly appreciated",

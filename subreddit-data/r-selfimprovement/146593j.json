    "postText": "Last years I\u2019ve been having more and more short temper. The only ones that used to experience it is my family because they used to be the only people I\u2019m extremely close to. And they tolerate it because they are all quite patient and love me, so I knew I\u2019m wrong but i was not willing to change. A year and three months ago I met my bf and ever since we started dating, I was much more calm next to him because we were going through the honeymoon phase. But now the honeymoon phase is over and I\u2019m more like myself-I mean I\u2019m more comfortable to show my toxic traits-. And I don\u2019t want to show him my short temper. For example when we are in the kitchen  together and he\u2019s not washing the dishes how I tell him or if he\u2019s doing it too slowly I get irritated. If I cook and drop something I tend to get sooo angry. And I don\u2019t want him to see that part of myself. He\u2019s so calm and patient. How can I improve? Do you have any actually useful tips?",

            "comment": "Your temper isn\u2019t the problem. It doesn\u2019t matter how short your temper is if your fuse is never lit. The main issue is your perceiving things as \u201cbad\u201d. Would you get mad if someone gave you 100k? No. If you change your judgment and values, which is the only long term solution, then you can see all these \u201cslights\u201d as life changing amounts of money. \n\nMost people value outcomes the most above everything else. \u201cThe dishes are being done \u201ctoo slow\u201d is outcome focused. If your aim wasn\u2019t to get the dishes done but you valued your own qualities higher then you\u2019d see it as an opportunity to be calm and patient, someone handing you the chance to be who you say you want to be. \n\nI think we also blame our emotions when they\u2019re just a consequence of these views we have. We get \u201cangry that we\u2019re angry\u201d because we accept the first impression we\u2019re given, that x is bad and we ought to change it. To try to manage emotions is like trying to grab water, all you can manage are the pipes, your views. If you\u2019re angry you\u2019ve been given an indication that your views are off the mark, that\u2019s what emotions are there for, to show you dysfunctional thought processes. \n\nThe solution is addressing the underlying judgment. If the dishes are going \u201ctoo slow\u201d, we might ask what that even means, and why do they have to be done quickly. Instead of communicating the anger we can address the actual point, you probably want to do something that else with them and those actual desires can be voiced.",

It\u2019s literally changing your value system.",

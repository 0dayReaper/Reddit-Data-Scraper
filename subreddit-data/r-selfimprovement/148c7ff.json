    "postText": "Have you ever started a project or goal with enthusiasm, only to lose motivation a few days or weeks later?\n\nYeah me too, but I figured out exactly why that is and how to combat it. I'll break it down into a few key points. \u2935\ufe0f\n\nLACK OF CLARITY:\n\nNow the first reason that people tend to lose motivation is due to lack of clarity, and that is a lack of clarity around what they are trying to achieve. Why do they need the motivation in the first place? \n\nTypically it is because they are working towards something in which the 'doing' of that thing is not necessarily what they want to do but they just want the end result.\n\nTherefore you need to be 100% clear on what you want as a result of doing the thing you don't want to and the end result will become much easier to obtain!\n\nBURNOUT:\n\nYou're not an operating system, unfortunately, you're a human being, therefore, you need to play to the strengths of your body and emotions. If it's clear you need to take a break then take it, some people try to push through this but they end up doing extremely low-effort work and therefore they are setting themselves back more than if they were to just take a small break and reset.\n\nHOW TO STAY MOTIVATED:\n\nThis is the formula for motivation: \n\nAction = Result = Motivation = More action = More Result.....\n\nTherefore you can't wait for motivation to occur, you have to take action to produce results that trigger more motivation to do it all over again!\n\nThis leads me to my final point which is Discipline&gt;Motivation.\n\nDiscipline should be the real reason that you do the action to achieve the result because motivation is volatile, it\u2019s inconsistent you can\u2019t be motivated 24/7.\n\nAnyways, one long breath later, that's how to increase motivation! \ud83c\udf33",

    "postText": "My brother and my close friend are out right now. But I struggle to leave the room and explore turkey because I\u2019m so depressed that I didn\u2019t \u201cglow - up\u201d like everyone else did. \n\nI\u2019m getting a hair hair transplant in couple days but I can\u2019t seem to be excited about it. As all I\u2019m doing right now is engaging in counterfactual thinking and regretting things I wish I had done and shouldn\u2019t have had  done. Everyone says \u201cyou\u2019re 24, you\u2019re so young you have time\u201d and etc but I don\u2019t feel that way at all. I feel so stuck I can\u2019t seem to get out of bed and be excited about anything",

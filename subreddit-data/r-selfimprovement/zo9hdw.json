    "postText": "I've read a lot about people who've jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge (one of the world's most frequent suicide locations) and one quote has stuck with me:\n\nKen Baldwin jumped from the bridge many years ago (a 220-foot fall that statistically results in death 97% of the time), but the moment he did so, he was hit by a horrifying realization while in mid-air: **\"I instantly realized that everything in my life that I had thought was unfixable was in fact totally fixable - except for having just jumped.\"**\n\nWith that sudden desire to live, Baldwin managed to change his body posture just before impact so that he hit the water feet-first rather than head-first (which would have meant certain death.) Even hitting feet-first, the only possible survivable posture, he still suffered numerous, severe injuries to his body. But he did survive, and went on to tell the tale and live a transformed life.\n\nIf you are ever suicidal, for whatever reason, please take Baldwin's words to heart - **whatever you may feel in your life is unfixable may in fact be totally fixable or something that can be lived with.** Don't wait until you're in mid-air after having leapt from a building or bridge to come to that realization.",

You are important even if you don't feel like it.",

Because he changed position to minimize his surface area entering the water, all of the force was concentrated on his feet/legs.\n\nIt may or not be perfectly true, but when I was training to be in the Navy, we had to do a jump off a 10m with that technique to ensure we could have a chance at surviving if falling overboard, especially from the deck of a carrier, which happens more often than you'd like to think. That was the analogy given.\n\nForgot to ask, the result might be similar if you landed feet first on concrete? Def break your ankles. Someone can correct me I'm not looking it up",

Yes, I am happy I'm still here, yes I'm devastated my loved ones aren't, but I understand why they did it, and I'm happy they aren't suffering anymore. \n\nThat being said, please seek help for suicidal ideation.

Good sleep hygiene, exercise, healthy eating, pursuing hobbies/passions, developing social connection, therapy/meds, etc. are pieces of the very complex puzzle that is positive mental health. It's hard work but well worth it. \n\nThat said, are you doing OK?",

There's no sugar coating it. So it comes down to this: is the hard work worth it? Do you want to at least give the hard work a shot before the final decision of suicide? I can tell you from personal experience I didn't think it could get better either, but in between my bouts of struggle with mental illness, I do experience happiness, contentment, and even excitement for the future. Ups and downs, that's the way of life.",

It is the realization that hard work is required for the entirety of our life, and that is an extremely tall order considering how overwhelming and chaotic life is. There aren't any simple answers, but we do have a hand in the narrative we tell ourselves. My life changed when I realized that it's not about making the joy outweigh the pain, but balancing the two.\n\nLife is about duality - there's always the opposite side of the coin. Good/bad, up/down, joy/pain. The crazy thing is the joy wouldn't be as beautiful without the pain, and the pain wouldn't hurt so much if we didn't know joy. I recommend existential therapy.",

I am of the generally unpopular opinion that suicide is a valid option IF AND ONLY IF you've tried everything else to improve the situation first. I believe bodily autonomy includes the right to choose when/how to end or lives, but I also know that even though life is really fucking hard, it's also amazing because two things can be true at the same time. The point is, you'll never know if life can get better if you don't try, and suicide is a permanent solution. \n\nPS I hope you're all right. Outside of terminal illness, most things can get better. Trauma can be healed, situations can be improved, and solutions are available. The hard part is being vulnerable enough to ask for help and then putting in the hard work to make things change.",

With that said, it takes really hard, often painful work to heal trauma, and some people won't/don't have the capacity to face it. \n\nHere's what I can tell you: it takes 100% honesty to heal trauma. The biggest lies we tell are to ourselves, and when we aren't honest with ourselves, we cannot be honest with those around us, including doctors and therapists, making true healing impossible. \n\nIf you truly want to heal, be honest, be brave, and be gentle with yourself. Healing isn't easy, and it isn't a linear process, but it is absolutely possible. You are absolutely capable.",

I think it finally stopped when he was 8. It tore the family apart when he got the courage to tell the truth, the cousin never faced consequences, etc. Anyway, he committed suicide on thanksgiving a couple years ago, at age 30. He just couldn\u2019t get through what happened to him, despite all the support in the world from his loving family and professionals. It affected so many aspects of his life. That\u2019s just one example, sadly I know many, but I\u2019m glad you asked the question. Trauma can not always be healed. And time certainly doesn\u2019t \u201cheal all wounds\u201d, as we\u2019ve all been told a billion times",

            "comment": "I've went through a similar way of thinking even without jumping. There were a few days and nights where I couldn't sleep anticipating how I'd plan my death in a few days, and then a few weeks, and then maybe in a few months and then maybe after a year or so.\n\nAnd what ended up happening? The more I plan, the more serious an attitudes I gave towards suicides, the more I subconsciously do things to avoid it. And I felt so weak for pussying out ON MY OWN DESIRE TO DIE. And the more research I do, the more inconvenient I felt planning all this. And I realized one day to myself: \"If I truly truly truly wanted to die, after 5 long years of neverending depression, when 2017 had suddenly became 2021. My highschool is over, I'm becoming a working adult tomorrow; and yet I could've made this decisions last year or when I was 14. But I didn't. I don't think I wanted to die, I just wanted my problems to end.\"\n\nSo I gave to the resolution that the truth is, I wanted a permanent way to run away from my life. But I could fix it. I didn't want to face it. But I could've always fixed it. It takes a big toll on my pride, my vulnerability, to be judged, and publicly make anxious and permanent social mistakes, and had fights with nasty people because of it. But I'm confident enough to say that:\n\nAs long as your alive, ofc your life can be fixed. Living is struggling to fix mistakes, and once you got everything together you'll still be fixing life obstacles. But that's the point of being alive.\n\nIf you ever think that life has nothing to offer, nothing could be worst, nothing good would come from it, remember that if you're gone, nothing would matter. If you think nothing in life matters, there's genuinely nothing in dying at all. You may imagine your \"enemies\" or uncaring parents to cry after your death, but there really won't be anything from you to feel or think or be petty about. Nothing at all.",

Like, you\u2019re in a very altered mental/physical state, and probably not triggering your body\u2019s physiological survival response the way that falling head-first would trigger.\n\n Obviously I don\u2019t want anybody to try bridge-jumping to prove me right/wrong, hah. I just mean that, just because you (or anyone else) haven\u2019t had that epiphanic experience with past attempts, doesn\u2019t mean that the original message doesn\u2019t apply to you. Like, it doesn\u2019t mean that youre the one person out there whose problems really can\u2019t be solved via non-lethal means. Idk if that makes sense\u2014to put it more clearly, im telling people to keep living. \n\nAnyway. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve been feeling better so far, and glad that your attempts have been unsuccessful. I hope things stay positive and continue to get better for you.",

Some people think of suicide *and smile.*  Some people wait patiently for years until their parents die for the moment to finally come.  It is relief.  It is going to sleep after insomnia. \n\nThere are two sides to this coin and I can't help but feel the \"please don't kill yourself, it can be fixed\" posts are an billboard eye-roll poetry I simply can't ingest.   \n\nIt does nothing to validate the feeling and pain of others.",

I am generally in favour of the \u201cit\u2019s fixable\u201d advice, because there are a lot of people whose situations are \u201cfixable\u201d (may not be easy or quickly or completely fixable, but still) but when people are in the midst of pain and agony, it is usually very hard for them to believe that. So I do think the \u201cit\u2019s fixable\u201d message is relevant and helpful to many people. But I do understand there are some situations where that is not the case. \n\nMy issue is with there that line gets drawn\u2014when it is \u201cacceptable\u201d to commit suicide and when it is not. Ultimately, I cannot and am not going to judge anybody who kills themselves, but for anyone considering it or  planning to attempt it, I would not condone the action unless I knew them and their situation extremely well, and knew that it was a decision being made from a place of rationality and certainty. \n\nI just fear that accepting suicide as an answer could too easily transform into enabling suicidal ideation in place of providing people with the support and resources they could otherwise use to get better, if that makes sense. Especially because, in Canada, this has already happened in a couple of cases. \n\nI think that \u201cit\u2019s fixable\u201d messaging does, overall, need to do a better job of acknowledging how difficult the process of \u201cfixing things\u201d can be\u2014how it can be long, hard, non-linear, and sometimes never-ending\u2014but the base premise is still incredibly important for people to hear.",

Sometimes people are too overwhelmed and don't want to face certain situations and who am I to go against their wishes? \nYes, suicide is devastating; in my opinion both for the family and the one who takes his/her life cause it takes a great amount of pain to drive someone to the edge. But sometimes I do believe people who do it Do rest, and maybe their families too. \nAgain, I'm not encouraging anything here, but I do think this post can harm people who are struggling",

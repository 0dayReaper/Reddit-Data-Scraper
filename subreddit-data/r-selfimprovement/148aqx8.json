    "postText": "Had anyone had this kind of conversations before and realised that so many people don\u2019t work hard at all, but still get so many things without putting in effort? \n\n1) me: how do you go for so many outings and parties all the time? \nA: I don\u2019t know, people just invite me? \n\n2) me: how do you make your friends remember your birthday and remember to buy you present? \n\nB: how can you \u201cmake\u201d people remember to buy you present? I don\u2019t! \n\nMe: then how come you can get so many? \n\nB: because they are my friends? Friends will remember birthday what! \n\n3) me: how do you make your boyfriend remember  to surprise you on your birthday and anniversary? \n\nC: I don\u2019t remind him or do anything, is he auto do. \n\n5) me: how do you get so many notes, cards and presents from everyone? Like so much??? \n\nD: Is people want to give me then they give lor. \n\nMe: I see that so many of the notes are so touching. You cried after reading them. How to feel so touched until you cry? (Pardon the bad phrasing) \n\nD: this kind of things cannot teach one. Is feeling. I from young is can one. How to teach you? \n\nMe: I also want to feel so touched that u cry but I don\u2019t know how it feels like. \n\nD: but I cannot teach you how to have feelings. You cannot then you cannot. \n\nEveryone is so innocent. I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t do anything. Having good things happens is just natural. I also don\u2019t know why god loves me so much and favours me. I really don\u2019t put in effort one. Wow. \n\nEver met such encounters? Is taking things for granted like very common here? \n\nWhat advice do you have?",

So they did quite a lot.\n\nYou need to learn how to socialise and make friends. You'll get out what you put in. So if you want people to make an effort to be your friend, then you need to put in the same effort to be their friend",

It's generally not a reflection on you, it's that everyone is different and everyone likes different kinds of people.\n\nIf they don't reciprocate the effort then they may not want to be your friend. So, yeah. Move on to the next person.\n\nThis is the struggle that we all face. This isn't just happening to you. What you're going through happens to literally everybody.",

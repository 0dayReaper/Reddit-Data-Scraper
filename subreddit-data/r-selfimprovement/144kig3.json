    "postText": "I have this problem since years that I am not drinking enough at all. I have my bottle next to me and it is literally a few cm in front of me but I keep forgetting to drink. I keep forgetting to drink until I almost collapse and even then I forget to drink.\n\nI tried to mark my water bottle in 200ml steps to drink slowly and motivate me to get the bottle emptys. I tried apps to help me drink more but it just doesn't work. I don't feel thirsty at all and I keep forgetting to drink.\n\nIt goes so far that I have constant headaches, collapse, and stomach issues. I am really trying but I just cannot get myself to drink enough at all no matter how much I try.",

            "comment": "Do you actually like water? Because I don't. Plain water tastes like ass. Personally, I drink heavily diluted orange juice, the occasional seltzer water and proteins shakes. All of which are like 95% water basically, just with some actual flavor.\n\nIf you don't drink anything and you never feel thirsty, that might be a legit medical issue. But if you have no trouble drinking other drinks, don't force yourself to drink water just because it might be 2% healthier or whatever.",

But like else I would sometimes drink juice purely but even then I forget to drink mostly or just dont feel that I need it.",

I use the app Waterllama combined with the Forfeit app to keep me drinking enough water. On waterllama i register all the water i drink during the day, and on forfeit i need to send an evidence that  i actually drank it, or i lose money. For me it works perfectly since i don\u00b4t really want to lose money for not doing something necessary like drinking water.",

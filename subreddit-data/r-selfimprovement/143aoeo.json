    "postText": "Music is a very interesting topic in the self-improvement genre; many people swear by it, whereas others are completely opposed to it. In the post, the Reformli team breaks down both sides of the argument for you to form your own opinion!\n\n**Number 1: Music as a motivator**\n\nMusic has the ability to influence our thought patterns and our spiritual fluidity. When we are in certain situations where extra motivation via a cognitive boost is required, music offers us this extra energy by detaching part of our mind from its current physical state and relocating it to a place where that music attends to it! For example, when we are competing in sports and many of us are in a situation where we can potentially lose, we listen to music that somewhat relates to success. This lets us envision the glory of victory prior to actually achieving it! Allowing us to push that one step further!The only issue here is that music can only act as a motivator in autonomous tasks where little attention to detail is required or in something that you are proficient in, for the following reasons: When we listen to music, we fundamentally become part of it, linking our soul and cognition to whatever the music is trying to portray, so it can strip you of your soul's personal identity, but this is not always the case for some people.\n\n**Number 2: Music as a force of stagnancy**\n\nI explained above how music can force us to become part of its essence and its proposed destination; therefore, if we attach our cognitive drivers to music designed to put us in our 'feels' or have us linger on the past, then we run the risk of staying there for too long or slowing our healing down! I understand that sometimes people can use these safe havens that the music creates as a potential respite from their current situation, as it allows them to essentially not be lonely, but please remember that your healing comes first!\n\nConclusion: There are both positives and negatives. Personally, I will only use music in low-level autonomous tasks like the gym, as I like my mind to be clear and unaltered from external influences, but like I said, what works for me may not work for you!\n\nThis is all for now!

I've always listened to music when I want to improve my mental health, and I try to avoid sad songs because you're right, all they do is keep you stuck in your feelings. The only problem is that, aside from music, I don't believe there is any other way to change your mindset, don't you?",

To suggest that our mindset is not changeable preludes to it being out of our control and autonomous, when this clearly not the case! your mindset is an extension of your internal drivers, belief systems and general aptitudes- In order to influence it,  target these 3 things I have mentioned above and you should be able to change it!",

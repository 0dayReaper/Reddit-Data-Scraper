    "postText": "I'm f17 and for the longest time I've wanted to join the police (or even military police) force. However, I am considered obese (5'9\", 197lbs). I wouldn't say I'm unfit, though. It's definitely all in my diet. Diet aside (I've started dieting already and it's going great), I am weak. I want to build up muscle mass and also burn calories. Where do I start? \nMy legs are strong, but my arms, shoulders and core are incredibly weak ever since I did hrt (for a genetic condition). My stamina is also poor, but it's gradually improving with me taking more walks.",

            "comment": "Start with the basics. Squats, Deadlifts, Bench Press, Rows. Strong lifts are 5x5 straight sets (same weight all sets). Even if you're not unfit, start out light and progress by 5-10 pounds every week, with a workout volume of 2-4 times a week. Take a rest week when you start to see stagnation. Good form, always. \n\nLight walking or jogging, nothing too crazy, just enough to get your heart rate up. If you feel pain jogging or running, stop and just go for a brisk walk.\n\nTo drop weight it's simply calories in calories out. Since you're just starting out you will be able to both build muscle and lose fat while eating at a calorie deficit.\n\nAlso, for law enforcement I recommend enrolling in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Some gyms offer discounts if you're training for or affiliated with law enforcement. You don't need to get in shape first to start grappling, you can certainly do both, and if you do, scrap the cardio for just taking walks. \n\nAlso, know your resources for tips, and advice. I like Jeff Nippard, Renaissance Periodization, Eric Helms, Knees Over Toes Guy and Juggernaut Training Systems. \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Stamina, stamina, stamina. That\u2019s the biggest and most important thing you can focus on. Your life will depend on it. Do HIIT and long distance running. If you can get a friend or brother or something to be a training aid. Run sprints and laps and stop and do a 3-4 minute intense grappling/wrestling session. Repeat. You need to be going intense though. You can\u2019t have your body and stamina give out if your wrestling on the ground for 5 minutes or more  waiting for backup. Also core strength, without that nothing else matters.\n\nEdit: It also would be very beneficial to take a bjj/grappling class or even a mixed martial arts where you get grappling and striking.",

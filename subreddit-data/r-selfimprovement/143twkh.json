If you think \u201cthe more I wait the more I\u2019ll enjoy it\u201d you will likely be shown otherwise. Emotions are not up to you. Have you expected something to be better than it actually was or to be mad at something only to be indifferent to it? A common story is when people hit a certain number in their bank account they might cry because they thought it would fix their problems or be a fundamentally different experience then it was. \n\nIf you want a good life goal, one you can never fail at, put your value in your effort, not the results of said effort.",

Of course that only works for so long, until eventually you'll come to realize that the day you've been waiting for might never come. And then you either have to come up with an even better story, and really believe in it as if your life depended on it. Or it's time to get serious and face reality: Nothing is going to change unless you make it happen. The girl of your dreams won't just come into your life if you only wait long enough. Those are just some fancy thoughts. The idea sounds nice but I think you know that there's no logic behind that. Life isn't a fairy tale. But if you see yourself as a victim, as someone who has no control over his life, then you'd rather keep telling yourself stories like that then to face reality.\n\nThe reality is that you decide how your life turns out. If you want something you have to work for it. If you keep sitting around at home you're not gonna meet any girls. So if you want to do that, then you'll have to go out and most likely approach girls actively. Don't expect them to come to you, no matter how you might look. That again just puts you into the victim mindset. Instead acknowledge that nothing is going to change until you start taking action. You need to make things happen. No one will do it for you. And if you keep sitting around and just wishing for things to happen, then you better be prepared for a lot of disappointment. And one day you'll grow old and will probably start to regret that you didn't take action sooner. And while it's never too late to make a change, it's always better to start now rather than after years of wasting your time and not getting anywhere.",

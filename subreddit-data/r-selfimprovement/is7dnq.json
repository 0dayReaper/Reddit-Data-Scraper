Mental and physical. \nMental selfharm is when you\u2019re for example convincing yourself that your not worthy and are a waste of time, space money. I believe suicide thoughts are a part of metal selfharm aswell. Basically ruining yourself mentally.\n\nPhysical selfharm is when you injure yourself purposely. You can do it because of many reasons but I believe one of the most common reasons to physical selfharm is to punish yourself.\n\nI still suffer with mental selfharm but it\u2019s gotten a lot better and I don\u2019t harm myself mentally most of the time. But I believe that\u2019lol last for the rest of my life, but who knows.\n\nWhat I mean with I\u2019m over 100 days clean from selfharm is that I haven\u2019t cut myself in over 100 days. Cutting is common type of physical selfharm where you cut yourself with razor blades, knives, scissors etc. I personally cut deep enough that it\u2019ll leave scars on my skin.",

I had a blackout a few months ago and I forgot a lot of things that were on my mind, unfortunately I forgot a lot of old memories but I\u2019d rather live in a good present than thinking back at old memories.\n\nIve also spent more time with people who care about me and who I like being around. It made me realize how unnecessary cutting is and how great people I have around me.\n\nBut it\u2019s not been easy, after I stopped selfharm by I had an eating disorder, became numb and lost all happiness and all emotions in general and went into a small depression. But I\u2019m recovering and life\u2019s going pretty well for me rn.\n\nI really hope your friend gets better. Stay safe",

But you wouldn\u2019t know that, you don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna take it seriously and start considering self harm again.\n\nSo please, for the future, don\u2019t joke about mental health because you have no idea how the other person might take it.",

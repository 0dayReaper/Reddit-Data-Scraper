Every moment not working on bettering my future was wasted, anything I did that turned out less than perfection was a failure.\n\nNow I've definitely grown from it. You can be ambitious, you can work hard, you can achieve your goals and you can do so without going through extreme pain. The only thing working yourself to the point of pain does is get you there a bit faster.\n\nIf you're okay with \"sacrificing part of your life\" only to receive saving time as your only prize, then fair enough. But you never know when you're gonna die, and if you're presented with a choice between getting by comfortably or painfully, life is too short to live any part of it in misery.",

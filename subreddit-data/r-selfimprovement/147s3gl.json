    "postText": "I just need to speak this into existence. Me (33m) and my fianc\u00e9 of 10 years split up just over a month ago. I\u2019ve never been good with my emotions, and was always extremely uncomfortable talking about what\u2019s going on in my life with others. Not sure if it was never wanting to be judged, or I don\u2019t want people in my business, or not wanting to hear advice on things I already know I should be doing. Despite the fact I\u2019ve found so much support from friends and family, it just feels easier speaking my feelings anonymously online to the masses. \n\nI am just so broken right now. A woman who I thought loved me has cheated on me multiple times with more than one person. Maybe it sounds weak compared to what others have overcome and gone through, but I\u2019m truly traumatized by it. It haunts me. Everything makes me think of it, of her, and what\u2019s happened. The first time was an affair where she had a relationship with somebody. I don\u2019t know that I really ever truly forgave her for that, and resentment on my end caused me to not treat her right. Maybe things should\u2019ve ended back then when I learned, but at the time I figured things would work out and we\u2019d move past it. \n\nThe second time was really the one that upended my life. She went on a trip, and cheated on me while out there. I saw a ton of evidence that I was cheated on, but I just chose to try to believe her. After all, what is a relationship without trust? For 8 months I was lied to and gaslit about how crazy I was for thinking I was cheated on. I did nasty stuff like search through her phone, and things you just shouldn\u2019t do, but deep down I wanted to know the truth. I hoped I\u2019d find something that backed up her story but never did. Ultimately, I called up a mutual friend and just cried about it and she let me know the truth.\n\nAgain, my dumb ass chose to try to work through it. Just 4 months after learning the truth, she said she plans to go in a girls trip again. I told her absolutely not. That was the hardline we both took. She moved out, took our kid with her. \n\nAs I sit here typing this, I know the advice I\u2019ll get, the things I should do, and it probably all lines up with what my brain tells me. \u201cMove on, nobody deserves to go through that. She has done it before, why wouldn\u2019t she do it again? Should have split up the first time.\u201d Despite it all, I\u2019m just so down and depressed and if she told me she\u2019d do all the right things I think I\u2019m weak enough to not be able to resist. I hate that I\u2019m too codependent and not emotionally or mentally strong enough to stand up for myself. \n\nI\u2019ve been working out, but I\u2019ve been drinking way too much. I\u2019ve downloaded all the dating apps but it\u2019s so hard to not compare the women I see on there to the one I just lost. I hate the thought of meeting a new woman. I want to be a guy who is cool going out and just finding a one night stand, or a hookup but at this point in my life, it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m about or what I want. I\u2019m starting therapy today, but\u2026 I\u2019m just broken right now so I wanted to share.",

            "comment": "\"It's so hard to not compare them to the women I've just lost\" - mate what have you lost? Someone who doesn't respect you? Someone that will fuck off with another bloke whenever you're not around? Someone who, after 10 years, will tear you down again and again and lie to you about it. \n\nYou've lost a liar and a cheat. Nothing else. \n\n The end of any relationship is tough, but it gets better because that's what time does. It heals. Push through this shit feeling and before you know it, you'll be living life through a different lens - a happier one, a more peaceful one. A life where you don't have to worry about your Mrs going out the front door cos who knows what she'll get up to? \n\nI'm not undermining what you built with your partner over the last 10 years, but she clearly didn't respect whatever it was enough to remain loyal. So, why should you waste another second beating yourself up about the fact she's hurt you. You deserve more than that. Everyone does. \n\nPut the drink down. Train harder. Work on yourself. Spend time with people you love. Do the things that make you smile, whether it's walking in the mountains or devouring a nice ol' Brisket. \n\nYou'll end up living a good life, getting through this with a smile on your face, and will be happy you stuck to your guns. If you do all of the above, this could end up being the best thing that ever happened to you. \n\nGood luck, and get in the gym tonight \ud83e\udd70",

You shouldn't try to go back to the way it was, and certainly not with her. Do not try to make that work again. Don't spend too much time looking back, either. You don't need to hate her, and shouldn't put energy into negative thoughts about her, or anyone else, but continue to focus on building up yourself, and being positive about the future. I know that's hard, and I know that you've turned to drinking more than you should to cope with it, but don't let that consume you. You've already made some good decisions, too; working out is a great thing for you to be doing. Might I recommend a community oriented activity as well? Look into to parks and rec teams in your town, or join a martial arts gym. Connect with people.\n\nGo easy on yourself. You were deceived, and the only one that reflects on is your ex. Now it's time to heal and grow.\n\nGood luck, brother, I believe in you.",

Don't worry about dating at the moment as you need to get over this hump and it has only been one month, so jumping into another relationship is not going to be very healthy. You live and you learn, your biggest mistake was to stay with her after she cheated on you on the first time. When a person betrays you the likelihood that they'll do it again is pretty high and as they always say a cheater will always be a cheater. She disrespected you by repeatedly cheating, you are going to be better off without this woman and you should consider yourself very fortunate even though it may be painful to admit. Just focus on yourself at the moment and keep working out, have fun with friends and enjoy the single life for a while, it'll take time but you'll definitely be better off in the end.",

This process will take time. \n\nYou may have some issues now with codependency, but those can be addressed with therapy and more positive coping mechanisms. Going on dates right now is not recommended. You're not in a good headspace, and even if you did get a ONS, it wouldn't change your feelings because the situation is like an emotional atomic bomb.

I am fairly certain the only reason it didn't turn physical was because his \"partner\" was across the country and he didn't have the money for plane tickets. Still. I found the sexts. And he did claim that me going through his phone to find out was \"just as bad\" as his sexting and when he told them all our relationship dirty laundry to laugh about together. It's been over a year since I found out about it, almost two at this point, and I still get anxious whenever he smiles at his phone, or he sends me a text that seems like it was intended for someone else. \n\nSo, I guess what I'm saying is, I'm sorry you had to go thru that, especially more than once. I know this is exactly the type of thing you don't want to hear right now, but the pain will lessen. It will hurt like hell for probably more than a few months, but there will be a day where you realize it stings a little less. It will become manageable, and while it may not disappear completely, you will get to a place where you stop thinking obsessively about it. \n\nMy advice is to let yourself break down a little bit. Whatever the hell you have to do to get through the worst of it is exactly what you should do. Whether that's going on dates, or staying in and playing games or watching movies or having a drink and just listen to some music. Ask a friend to stay with you for a bit and hang out. Go see your family, if you're close to them. Take any and all distractions for the time being until the pain seems a little bearable. \n\nJust be aware of yourself, and don't let it get too out of control. Don't wind up an addict because of some shitty person that never appreciated you to begin with. Lick your wounds, but don't forget to let them heal too.",

She had to work her way back up. She chose not to. You split.\n\nEnd of story. It's just an end of a one story, another is starting to unfold, the new pages are written. You are now more mature, you know better what woman do you want. She is there, I guarantee that. \n\nAlso, be with your kid. She cannot own your children. \nAnd tbh, fuck her. Its painful. You better make this pain hate than hope, it will.be easier. It will be a growing experience for you. You will become stronger and more independent than ever. \n\nIt will just hurt. A lot. For some time. Time will heal it. Its just a new chapter bro. So much to experience. I am happy for you. Take care.",

My past relationship likely cheated whilst I dont know for sure I had deep feelings as it was only a two year relationship compared it still took me over a year to heal. They say that it usually takes half the time. This is a lesson for you to learn to respect yourself and cheating to be a non negotiable. Make sure your future partner values and respects you and your boundaries. I wish you luck",

The cruel thing about breakups is that I immediately started remembering the good and forgot about all of the things that made the relationship terminally flawed. I fell in love with the way I thought it would be. The way that I wanted it to be. The reality was that it was never going to be great. \n\nFeel the suck but don't make the same mistakes. Learn from the flaws so that each of you are better positioned to find happiness. Loss is tough. It just is. Fast forward to my current relationship founded on trust and honesty. I've haven't been so optimistic in years. I'm 53 so the notion that I'd die alone seemed closer than when I was 33. Grow and learn from the suck. Improve yourself and good things will happen.",

Although it happened to me within two relationships, I know what its like to lose the one you truly love and what its like to be cheated on. I dont wish that upon anyone.\n\nBut if I can tell you one thing that helped me, it was relearning what it meant to love myself and respect myself again for the person I am. All the blame you put on yourself over the years will truly pull you to rock bottom and once you get there, you need to take every single step that it takes to get out again. One step at a time.\n\nYou can still be an amazing father and the person you want to be. You just gotta ask yourself who that is and start from there. On days where you feel absolutely shit, where you might drink etc, try to still change at least something, simply as much as you can. If you don't change, nothing will.\n\nIm a couple years younger than you, but mate - the thirties aint so bad I think. There is still lots of life to live. Working out has helped me a lot, I just went to the gym everyday to let it all out and made new friends and experiences through that, but anything will help, as long as you like doing it.\n\nYou should also really look for some books man. I read a bunch of clever books from people way smarter than me and it can really help speed up any process basically. They are also not difficult to find.\n\nAnyway man, it just felt like I could relate a bit, Still incredibly sorry for you mate. You gotta get through the pain first and foremost and try not to let it break you. But there are always better times coming, it cant get any worse now can it?",

The fact you mentioned this, which is good, means that its important to you, and might be where you subconsciously know where the problem is.\n\nI'm not a therapist, so you are doing the right thing by going to them and should take their advice first. Though maybe you can bring this up to them too. Maybe you might be trying to rationalize what happened and have considered it a link. Even if you know what to do, since your suggestions make sense and imply you are a smart person, hearing things from others (mainly professionals) can have a more convincing effect, especially if you don't currently trust yourself with that happened.\n\nThere aren't any shortcuts to recovery, just take your time and when you eventually recover enough, your experience becomes your wisdom. You will find that the journey to recovery had made you a better you than before.",

I can\u2019t compare the situations, but I think I get the feeling of THINKING you lost an awesome person.\n\nI also broke-up with my bf a fee months ago and was really envy on the women I thought he will meet and his life and everything..until I put it down on paper. I recommande you do a list of all the things she really sucks at such as having any moral values, being honest, being trustworthy, being kind(she gaslighted you and manipulated), etc. Every time the big feelings come, let them come. They seems scary as they bring pain, but most of the times is the fantasy we attach to them that is more painful (example: \u201cI miss her\u201d turns into \u201cI\u2019m never going to meet such a good-looking woman because I am unworthy\u201d and bang, you let yourself down again).  If you were to feel the pain, cry and remember why YOU wouldn\u2019t want someone like her, you gain the power back. Because you too, should choose! And who would choose such a person?\n\nIt is hard, but learn to navigate through this, go to therapy, cry when you feel like it. It will pass eventually, I promise you! And you will learn to be a better friend to yourself and that is something you will completely adore when you achieve. \n\nBut you know what won\u2019t pass tho? Her behaviour. She will do this again and again (since I don\u2019t see any willingness of her to change) and she will end up alone because sure, sex is cool, but nobody wants to have a relationship with an active cheater. She will have a nasty dating life, for sure. \n\nSo when you compare women on dating apps next time, put the \u201cmaybe she is not a cheater and has a good soul and is kind unlike my ex\u201d. \n\nHope you see the end of the tunnel soon!",

It\u2019s so easy to get lost in despair. But when a man is in despair, it means he still believes in something.\nI think it\u2019s great you\u2019ve been working out, but you have to cut back drinking. It is poison to you mentally and physically and you will feel so much better and stronger once you stop. \nGive dating apps a shot, although I personally vowed to never touch them again. I think a focus on reality is much more valuable. Dating apps honestly create a lot more negatives than positives. Same thing with watching porn. Just cut it out, you don\u2019t need it.\nI can\u2019t imagine the pain you must feel from 10 years, so I am really not so equipped to help you. I\u2019m feeling stuck in a two year relationship at the moment and this has put my trivial problems in perspective. But time heals, trust me.\nI think the best revenge is to not be like your enemy, ie embody every virtue your ex lacked. It\u2019s okay to be weak, so take your time to heal and recover, but it\u2019s not okay to stay weak. You\u2019ve got this in you, I know you do. Set yourself some goals. Work your ass off. Make her regret everything.\nStay strong man",

I'm pretty sure this is hell \ud83d\ude02 BUT it does get better, if you make it better. I hated when people would say that to me because it was like \"no it won't\" but it really does. I also started therapy and IT WAS A LIFE SAVER! It helped me get out of a victim mentality and have somewhere where I could share all of my feelings about my split in a non-judgmental setting with someone who didn't know  ex and was just there for me. All of my therapy sessions were spent crying over my ex. BUT IT HELPED. I needed it. I recommend setting small goals or activities to help you get your feet on the ground again. Having something to look forward to wether it's a walk with a friend, dinner with your friends or kids, going to a movie alone, etc just set a goal/event for each week. It'll keep you going when things get worse. You did dodge a bullet. I bet you feel so many feelings and so conflicted and therapy should help you sort through those. What matters now is what you want and building a life you're happy with. I agree don't do the dating apps right now, it's too soon and you'll just feel like crap. Don't rush, this process just started. It helped to read post about people who were a year or months into this process and to see their progress and how they also still missed their last partner (at least for me). Remember healing is non-linear and just because it feels like shit does not mean you're doing bad. You got this! I'm here if you need to vent. I recommend the podcasts \"now to get over your ex without it just taking time\" \"date yourself instead\" and on Instagram there's a woman called healingwithdarlene. These have been amazing for me. Also having a great support system where you could call them up and cry and yell and sort out your thoughts is 10000% necessary for me and might be good for you too. You got this. Don't rush this process. You spent 10 years with her, it won't go away. The goal isn't to hate her but to realize that you're someone worth losing too. You got this and you have so many Reddit communities who are here for you on this journey too. Lastly, everyone will have opinions on what you should do but they aren't you.",

Time heals all wounds. Give yourself grace and time to get over this relationship. This was a person who you thought you could spend your entire life, who you have a child with etc. it\u2019s not going to be easy for you to readjust your brain to the idea of a life partner that isn\u2019t her. You don\u2019t have to do that right now. You can do that when you\u2019re ready to and want to. \n\nFrom reading this post, it sounds like this has really put a damper on your self esteem. The best thing to look forward to right now is meeting a new version of you. Find understanding and love for yourself in the grace that you gave your partner. Many people wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive cheating, but you did try. That shows you\u2019re capable of so much love. Try to see the positive outlook on things instead of thinking so negatively. She\u2019s the one who did something wrong. Not you. You stayed with someone who you had been with for years and shared a life with. Don\u2019t hate yourself forever for that.\n\nGoing to the gym and therapy is very good. Maybe look into a hobby or goal you can pursue that keeps your mind totally off of this relationship. Like playing an instrument or hiking x amount of trails. Cooking good meals for yourself, getting into classical music, watching all of the movies of x director.

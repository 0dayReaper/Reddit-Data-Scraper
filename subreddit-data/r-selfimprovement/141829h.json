    "postText": " Choosing to live an authentic life is a harder path, paved with obstacles and solitude.\n\nNonconformist, unique individuals were always feared by the masses. With their authentic way of life, they trigger doubt in the minds of the crowd regarding the actual significance and validity of their social roles.\n\nRemember how we talked about how most people get their self-esteem from being \"a person of value\" in our ideological \"world of meaning\"? Well, imagine when that type of person sees someone trying to be a person of value by their own standards and in their own world of meaning. To a person who\u2019s been living an inauthentic life, the authentic person challenges the significance of their whole life.\n\nIt is no wonder then that the masses actively discourage and suppress the cultivation of character and try to stifle any attempt at uniqueness, considering that they are trying to preserve the value and significance of their very existence.\n\nThis is why those who decide to embark on the path of an authentic life are destined to be met with discouragement, ignorance, ridicule, rejection and at times even isolation from the society.\n\nBeing unique is difficult. In fact, according to Nietzsche, being unique is so difficult that it is not fear, but laziness that prevents so many of us from living authentically. He argues that our greatest fear is actually the fear of how much effort is required to persist in being a unique individual.",

Where do I even start?",

Get You Tube on your Television and look up \"upper body workouts\", \"lower body workouts\", resistance band workouts\", etc.. TONS of FREE FREE FREE 10-40 minute videos! Then, go for a 1-2 mile walk after you finish your video. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood Luck!!!",

And for the motivation issue, to keep you doing it (cause consistency is actually the most important point when starting to work out) you can try the forfeit app, which you need to send an evidence completing a task, or you lose money. So i set it to send a timelapse working out everyday for 20 min, or i lose $10, and it\u00b4s great to motivate me, you can do the same, it\u00b4s a great tool!",

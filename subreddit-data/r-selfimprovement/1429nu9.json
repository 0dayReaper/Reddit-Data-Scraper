    "postText": "We've all heard the saying 'You're the average of the 5 people you hang around' right? And that is more than true in every case but one thing that the majority of people don't consider is how what you consume affects you.\n\n  \nYou become what you consume, even from day one, the tv shows and movies you grew up on helped to form your perceptions of life because as humans we learn from example and from experience. Give it a try, and think back to the stuff you consumed as a child and how it impacted you and moulded you into who you are today.\n\n  \nBut it's not only our childhood that formed our perceptions, In a world of endless content and consumption if you're not consciously aware of what you consume then you're not better than a child.  \nPeople want these dream lives, nice houses, nice cars and everything in between however the content they consume couldn't be leading them in a direction further away from that.\n\nYou have to consume what you want your future reality to become. Once you truly understand that you can form your own future.  \nLet's take an example such as Tiktok, the average person spends 2-4 hours a day on it consuming roughly 21 pieces of content a minute! That's 1260 Tiktoks an hour! Which is anywhere from 2560 to 5000 PER DAY!\n\n  \nNow if you consume up to 5000 pieces of content a day no matter how long or short and the content you consume isn't morphing you into a better version of yourself then you are slowly committing suicide.\n\n***PS.

            "comment": "Humans are context creatures. You think of what you remember (recency bias) and that\u2019s what you have at hand to engage with in situations. \n\nThat being said when you have certain core beliefs *all consumption* is filtered through those beliefs and they\u2019re the basis for agreement and disagreement. If you\u2019ve ever had an essay in school it\u2019s way easier when you already have an opinion and this is no different. \n\nWhat we might find however, like philosophers of old, is that our core beliefs are a Frankenstein of what we\u2019ve heard and have no coherence when tested.\n\nIn actuality who or what content you\u2019re consuming is secondary to these core beliefs because it\u2019s the core beliefs that make all other media useful or not. Maybe advocating people get a coherent philosophy of life is far more important than trying to filter things with a crooked lens.",

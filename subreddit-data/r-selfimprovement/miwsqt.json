    "postText": " I came up with this little thinking exercise, which is also pretty fun! Think of your life as a second chance, thinking of the first life as a total failure, as a waste.\n\nYou can think that you got reincarnated and lost your memories or something. \n\nIt's a bit weird, but somehow it works for me, it motivates to make the best of my life thinking that I do not want to fail again.It makes you see things from a different perspective. Play with this thought idea, and see if it can help you. \n\nMaybe this can help someone else so I thought I might share.",

The problem is that either we miss that chance by remaining attached to a past failure, to a story without a happy ending, or because we consciously deny accepting that chance, condemning ourselves to a life of failure. As always, life is made up of choices, and our success depends on seizing the chances that life gives us.",

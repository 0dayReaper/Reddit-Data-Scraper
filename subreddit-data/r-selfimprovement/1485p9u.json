            "comment": "Sounds like you might either have goals that are too lofty or not enough goals. Aimlessly learning programming without an idea or an end in sight will burn you out. If there's a project or a thing you want to make specifically, it's way easier to work toward that then to just arbitrarily read and follow workshops/classes. Same goes for basically everything. Have a goalpost in mind when you start tackling something and bite off little pieces at a time instead of bullrushing the fucker.",

            "comment": "Starting strong and then losing motivation happens to many of us. One thing you can try is setting smaller, achievable goals for yourself instead of diving into a skill with overwhelming expectations. Break down the learning process into manageable steps and celebrate your progress along the way.\r To combat the lack of motivation, find ways to make it more enjoyable. You could also try using the Forfeit app, which adds an element of accountability by requiring you to send evidence of completing tasks or risking losing some money.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, it's okay to take breaks and rest, but try not to let the cycle of starting and stopping discourage you. Consistency is key, so even if you don't feel motivated every day, make an effort to practice or learn a little bit. Over time, you'll build momentum and see progress.",

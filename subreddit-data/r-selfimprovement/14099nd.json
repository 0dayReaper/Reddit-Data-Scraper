I usually blame these characteristics to how I was sheltered as a child\u2014teen. However, I am tired of blaming the system to how I was raised now that I am 23. \n\nI can now freely do (some) things on my own. Tho I am still very awkward and have anxiety and occasional panic attacks but I think I am now in control with my life (or so I think).\n\nAt this point, I am at fault if I fail my life for the next years. I must navigate now on my own or else I sink. LMAO.",

It sucks im getting to the point of being more social later in life than others, but the best time other than yesterday is today, and I can\u2019t change yesterday",

I truly believe it is one of the first two steps (the other being awareness and perceptions of problems) that everyone should take on a self-development journey.\n\nSo bravo for this insight! It is more powerful than you might think. Instead of hosting a victim mentality and attaching your problems to excuses, you can take control and choose where you go from here.\n\nIt's a difficult thing to come to terms with at first imo, but thoroughly liberating.",

Ask yourself, what does a \"failed\" life actually mean? Who's standards are you holding yourself up to? Instead of blame think of influence... As in... Instead of saying a blame my childhood on X, say X was influenced by my upbringing. It gives you more ability to still recognise and take ownership of your own actions that may have influenced a particular outcome, but it also allows you to take ownership of the beautiful and amazing outcomes in your life. \n\nRemember there's room for \"I need to take control and make better outcomes occur\" but whether we like it or not, we exist within a complex socio political environment and we exist through interactions with family, friends, community and systems. Try not to ask too much of yourself and find what does \"a good life\" actually look like to me.\n\nAll the best champion!",

I personally think having the understanding and insight of your upbringing and the effects that had on how you did things in some of your formative years is incredibly important and useful to keep in mind, but feeling like a victim and blaming everything on it for the rest of your life is not helpful at all. Use that insight to give yourself some self compassion, but push yourself to grow at the same time  :~)",

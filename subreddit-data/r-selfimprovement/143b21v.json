    "postText": "Good morning,\n\n I can't manage to give direction and meaning to my life.\n\n I left my country in 2018 to live in Thailand.  I worked as a bar and guesthouse manager, DJ and event planner for my ex-girlfriend for three and a half years.\n\n I left Thailand in June 2022 due to domestic abuse and visa issues.  I now live in Cambodia.  I work as a freelance in the field of writing, web marketing and community management.\n\n I worked for 2 and a half years for a friend who owns a web marketing agency but he replaced me with an apprentice who is cheaper and who lives in the same city as him.  My friend did not have the frankness to tell me if he was going without my services.\n\n I am now looking for freelance contracts.  I have just concluded a mission but it is difficult to find contracts, so I find myself in a period of professional inactivity.\n\n  I have been working for 2 years with my friend on a video game blog that I am trying to monetize but I am losing confidence and hope in the project.\n\n I feel tired, demoralized and unmotivated.  I no longer want to invest my time and energy in projects that do not bring me money.  My girlfriend supports me and I feel ashamed and helpless.",

I might not have enough information or background to make this conclusion but given the information I have now: I really think you are strong and have tried lots of things and the reason they did not work out might have nothing to do with you personality and inabilities but more with the circomstances. \n\nI think you should not give up and keep doing what you like to do. Your luck might turn around in 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 6 months or whatever \u2026 who knows ? \n\nFocus on the support of the people around you and don\u2019t stop believing in yourself. Keep improving, keep waking up, keep eating, keep being kind, \u2026 \n\nFinding some structure in your days might help to see the improvements you make and the impact they have. It also might improve your thoughts from spiraling. \n\nAnd please remember that at this moment just going out of bed or going for a walk might also be an improvement depending on your personal situation\u2026 \n\nSending you lots of love and courage!",

            "comment": "First of all, please don't be too hard on yourself. Life has its ups and downs, and it's okay to feel tired and overwhelmed at times. It's great that you have the support of your girlfriend during this challenging period. When it comes to finding freelance contracts, it can be a competitive field, but don't lose hope. Keep networking, reaching out to potential clients, and showcasing your skills and experience. Have you considered using the Forfeit app? It's an app that adds a bit of accountability to your goals. You commit to completing tasks and if you don't provide evidence, you lose some money. It might help you stay motivated and focused on finding new contracts. Additionally, take some time to reassess your video game blog project. If it's causing you more stress than joy, it's okay to reevaluate and maybe shift your focus to other projects that align better with your goals and bring in income. Remember to prioritize your well-being and mental health.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m not a teenager anymore (In my late 20s) but I still find myself comparing myself to other people which I absolutely hate but can\u2019t help doing.  \n\n\nThe other day I met this amazing girl who was the life of the party. She\u2019s smart, beautiful, kind, and just a bright light. Everybody there was drawn to her energy. She was like a magnet. I feel so jealous of her because I wish I could be like that, and now I\u2019m putting myself down and putting her up on a pedestal. I know my ego wants to desperately find something to \u201cone up her\u201d. Just something\u2014 like maybe I\u2019m a little smarter than her or more composed\u2026  \n\n\nI know this sounds ridiculous but I guess it\u2019s my mind\u2019s way of protecting me and making me still feel important to myself I guess??  \n\n\nI\u2019m not 15 in high school anymore but I\u2019m comparing myself and I hate it!  \nTL;DR- how do I stop comparing myself to others and how do I stop trying to \u201cone up\u201d those people in my mind to make me feel better about myself?",

I\u2019m so jealous that he\u2019s able to. Pisses me off more he\u2019s with my crush. I\u2019m learning to get out more. Walking everyday helps. I\u2019m gonna start sitting at the mall and read. I have no idea how to meet women outside of bars or the internet. But I\u2019m trying. And that\u2019s the best you can do is try. Try new things. If not re-learn old hobbies that you love and keep with them. Boost your confidence. There are many ways to. \n\nEdit to add: I\u2019m not that guy. I\u2019m someone completely different. I love music. From dancing to singing. Don\u2019t give a fuck who sees. That\u2019s me. Find you because you are not her. So no reason to compare.",

First thing for me was to channel that jealous feeling into something like admiration, because I feel like jealousy is an emotion that can be fairly malleable depending on what you choose to do with it. But on top of that, having someone like that around me inspires me to work on and become a better version of myself. So try not to see it as competition, but as inspiration.",

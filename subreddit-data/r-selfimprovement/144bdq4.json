    "postText": "I'm a musician and I also play games competitively. These are my main hobbies and I get the most enjoyment from tackling skill based challenges that force me to learn. The problem is that these experiences are very, very frustrating.\n\nI've been going to tournaments for a bit now, playing music longer than that. I practice as much as I can when I have the energy and time. Specifically, I try to make sure my practice is deliberate and meaningful, but it feels that no matter how much I practice it just isn't enough to make significant improvements. I still learn slower than a majority of my friends and lose to them for long periods of time before I can get even close. I fumble and make the same mistakes repeatedly - making basic errors that cost me games that I'm otherwise doing okay in. Sometimes I play people and feel like I'm on a completely different planet of skill from them; like nothing I can do would ever set me up with the ability needed to beat them. \n\nHow am I supposed to not be discouraged by this, or believe that my efforts are worth it? It often feels like it takes me twice as long to learn things as the people around me, and I get so frustrated so quickly. Even with all my practice and time I still cannot come close to people who may not even be putting in the same amount of effort as me (bad attitude, but it hurts when you play your friends who do not practice something anymore and they still slaughter you despite you practicing it often). The road feels pointless because I'm not getting good enough to hit my goals. This makes me not want to practice, so I have to force myself to. I'm always frustrated since I know rationally I *need* practice, but my constant bad results make it never worth it. \n\nI've considered whether or not my practice is productive, whether or not my mentality is good, etc but it feels like it leads back to this feeling of being almost marked to never be good enough to compete at a higher level. I try to specifically drill problems, ask questions of others, review my work, etc but it doesn't seem to prevent me from making the same mistakes over and over. This really fucking sucks and ruins the fun of my hobbies in the first place, because I don't want to do it anymore if I'll never be as good as I want to. \n\nI feel like I'll get an answer about just being satisfied with my own small improvements, but if those improvements are never big enough to change the result it just makes me feel stupid for being happy about them. I just want to enjoy my hobbies and believe that my work will pay off, but currently, all I feel is depressed when I try over and over and never get further than I already have.",

If you're not particularly talented at something then your only answer is to work harder than everyone else, no getting around it. Pursue it relentlessly and who knows what level you'll be at in 5 or so years. You may become world class, you also might not, but it's worth finding out, what else are you going to do.",

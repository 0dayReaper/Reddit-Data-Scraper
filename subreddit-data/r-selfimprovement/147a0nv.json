    "postText": "I have made a lot of improvement in my life over the years, but there has always been one thing that has held me back. I get sucked into internet wormholes, and have found it hard to engage in other activities. I've tried deleting apps and using website only versions of various social media and the like. I have restricted my use by time. I've unfollowed stressful accounts/subreddits. I think at this point I can accept that no matter what I do, I spend more time online in communities related to my hobbies than actually engaging in the hobbies. I think all that is left is to quit everything.  \n\n\nIt does help that I am nearly thirty and outgrowing some of this stuff (I couldn't be fucked about likes or follower counts or whatever), so I feel more ready than ever. What is holding me back is considering  whether or not I should just rip the bandaid off. \n\nThoughts?",

            "comment": "Gotta be honest, quitting social media/limiting reddit has been a very positive change for me personally. I blocked it on my phone and check it occasionally on computer but the default way we spend time ideally should give us a return for our investment. You could always take a 30 day hiatus and re-evaluate how you feel after.\n\nYou could also look up Digital Minimalism and see what free videos/content is available, there's a lot of people who have found this to be a great change.",

            "comment": "I can see how it seems like a good idea but what do you do during downtime, like when you are eating or in bathroom or taking breaks?  Just stare at the walls?  Seems like that would drive me crazy if I didn\u2019t have another plan.  Similarly, do you have alternative social interaction?  I\u2019ve definitely considered getting rid of social media but that means the only adult I would have personal contact with is my therapist most weeks.  Idk maybe that\u2019s enough but it\u2019s daunting enough to make it hard to pull the trigger.",

Luckily that social interaction is enough for me, and I am hoping to go out to more events in my spare time. I think for random moments of dead time I would ideally like to be comfortable with a bit of boredom, but can always try things like online chess or reading the news before I get there. I have a ton of books I want to read too, so I'm looking forward to getting through those. I guess I know I can always come back here if that all sucks lol so I don't feel too worried about it.",

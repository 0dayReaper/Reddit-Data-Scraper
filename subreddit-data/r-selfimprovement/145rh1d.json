    "postText": "Your lizard brain is dumb, and has no regard for your goals. It only cares about getting immediately-gratifying stimulation. But, it has infinitely more willpower than your logical brain.  \n\n\nAt most, your logical brain has 3-4 hours of concentrated willpower at its disposal. After that, it's depleted - and you won't be able to white-knuckle it through hardship any more. That's when the Lizard Brain takes over again, bringing you right back to instant gratification.\n\nRather than trying to out-willpower it, recruit it to your side. \n\nThis requires two big steps:\n\n1. Remove all access to quick dopamine releases. Trash it all. Anything that gives you quick dopamine hits must be put as far away from the lizard brain as possible. \n\n2. Offer up something else as an alternative for the Lizard Brain. Make it something productive, something that moves you towards your ideal life. Make it a process, not an outcome. Something you can gamify, and track your progress on.\n\nIf done successfully, you can replace old habits with better ones without having to rely on a finite source of willpower to do so.",

It\u2019s also helping me pay down the massive amounts of debt I have. So. I\u2019m leaning into it. Big time. Just got a second bartending gig and I plan on working 6-7 days a week for a while. I walk to both jobs so the commute is a piece of cake. It\u2019s not even a long walk. It\u2019s ten minutes and five minutes. Life is good atm",

Something like a test for exam is scary because we have logically evaluated it at some point as a threat. Logic isn\u2019t inherently rational, it\u2019s just internally consistent which is why we have maladaptive behaviors. \n\nDopamine is not the only brain chemical involved, there\u2019s serotonin, glutamate, canabanoids, that all influence these things. If you hear someone harping on one neurotransmitter there\u2019s probably a lot missing in the assessment. \n\nI\u2019d just mention that it was a fine addition to focus on the progress and not the outcome. Most of the habits we wish to implement are things we think are \u201cgood\u201d but we have objections to implementing them. Instead of addressing those objections as valid we often ignore them and try to force ourselves into doing things we actually don\u2019t see as viable. As you might imagine that\u2019s not necessarily sustainable.",

With many things, the strategy of just jumping in is favored, and while it could potentially work, your \"lizard brain\" is gonna freak and say \"Wut?! Fuck that, that's not pizza and Playstation at all.\" (Or whatever people do)\n\nSo make lists of what you'd like to accomplish while still giving yourself \"comfort time\", with the goal of pushing a little more and a little harder everytime it's time to get stuff accomplished. You won't freak out your \"lizard brain\" into thinking it's too much and keeping you unmotivated, because you still have that comfort time/zone. Plus some of the thins we like in our comfort zones are totally fine and normal, we're human, it's just a matter of not getting excessive and ignoring when it's time to shit done.",

There is no one \"right\" way to live a fulfilling life. \n\nMy goal in life is to travel as much as possible and have as much fun as I can while I still can. I have a degenerative nerve disease that eventually will kill me. Thats not negative, it's just a medical fact. That means that I live in a small apartment, drive an older car that's kinda ugly, and I'm pretty frugal in my day to day. To someone else, I may seem like an unsuccessful person because I don't have the newest IPhone, or a fancy car, etc.\n\n However, I don't give a single shit about those things if it means I get to go to a once in a lifetime experience. If I get to see beautiful places and beautiful people and culture, I really don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. Having lots of stuff or a certain job title or making a six figure income is nice for sure, but many people can be happy and fulfilled living without those.\n\nYou do you boo!",

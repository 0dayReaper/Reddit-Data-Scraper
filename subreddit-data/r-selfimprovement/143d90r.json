It can be overwhelming when there is a lot of options, so start with the small stuff like going for a walk, especially when you don't feel like doing it.  \n\n\nDoing simple things when you don't feel like doing them will teach your brain about discipline. The hardest part is to start, the rest is process.",

Break it down into small, actionable steps that you can tackle one at a time.\r To stay accountable and motivated, try using the Forfeit app. It's a cool tool that helps you stay on track by setting tasks and losing money if you don't complete them. For example, you could set a daily workout goal and commit to a small forfeit if you miss a session.\r Don't overwhelm yourself with too many changes at once. Focus on consistency and progress over perfection.",

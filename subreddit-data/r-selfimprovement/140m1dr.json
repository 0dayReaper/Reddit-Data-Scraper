    "postText": "**How did my week go (29/05 - 04/06)?**\n\nThe week started pretty decent; I was consistent with all my daily disciplines, made fine progress, and had a good mood. I've noticed my happiness increase since being consistent with gratitude journalling and meditation. Towards the latter half of the week, I started to get feelings of loneliness sneak in. Coupled with this were some urges that came all of a sudden. I've started to realise I am much more likely to get PMO urges when I feel most lonely, which makes a lot of sense.\n\nNone of this was negative, though! I've found that feelings of isolation are the best prompts for introspection and a true test of your character. Becoming comfortable with these feelings makes me feel more confident and in control of my emotions. Hell, I'd say that I'm starting to enjoy the feelings. I don't think I want to get too comfortable though, otherwise, I feel that would put me at risk of becoming permanently sequestered lol. I think it will take some more time to figure that out.\n\nI also started to get some feelings of self-doubt towards the end of the week. A few months ago this would have stirred up some major anxiety, but I am now able to shut it down quickly. Changing my perception of doubt and self-sabotage has exponentially increased my self-belief and how much I get done.\n\n**The Biggest things I did this week:**\n\n1. I had my 2nd Muay Thai class.\n2. I wrote my first article online.\n3. I started working out on my parallettes again.\n4. I was consistent with my daily disciplines.\n5. I did a few things I was resisting due to perfectionism.\n\nAlthough I have been reading every day, I want to read more. I feel I should be learning more, so this is something I will work on next week.\n\nOn one of the days I forgot to journal and play the guitar because of work and, well, life. I didn't miss any other days. I only count the discipline being broken if I miss 2 consecutive days. This way, I don't create unnecessary stress.\n\nI didn't overwhelm myself this week, which I am proud of. I also wrote my first article online. It is very similar to my post earlier in the week on Reddit. It's not much, but it's a start. And I don't plan on giving up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Most valuable things I learnt:**\n\n1. Learning people's names and having a genuine interest in who they are is an amazing conversation starter and an exceptional way to get to know people.\n2. There comes a point where you need to dedicate more of your time to remembering key information rather than learning more. Chances are that you know more than enough to get going.\n3. Motivation is a scam. The only thing that has changed as I have waited to feel more motivated is how old I am. Motivation is like masturbation - masturvation? Motibation? Hahah I  like that. I'll explain it in more depth later.\n\nI had a conscious aim this week to be more social. I thought a good experiment would be to learn people's names, try hard to remember them, and then say their names with a big smile when I next see them. Honestly, the results were kind of remarkable\n\nPeople who I have never even seen crack a smile before gave me the heartiest grins after I said their name with a smile and asked how their day was going. I showed genuine care for them and made them feel important in the process. It always made me happy when I did this. I'm going to do it more often.\n\nAfter reading some chapters of my book this week I came to realise just how much crucial information I had forgotten. I thought: why am I bothering to learn when I will simply forget so quickly? I have now redirected my efforts to remember more than I learn right now. I think this is for the best.\n\nOn the whole motivation/masturvation thing, I've come to see motivation as nothing more than mental masturbation. It makes you feel hella good for a little while. Then you go to sleep, and it's just... gone. It always feels like such a bruh moment. In the evening you can conquer the world, climb the highest mountains, and do anything you ever dreamed of! Then come the next morning and you feel overwhelmingly low.\n\nThis overwhelming low compared to the previous high, I feel, lowers your baseline ability to commit to work because you judge your current passion for your previous quasi-passion, which in turn makes you feel guilty, or that you're \"just not a motivated person\".\n\nI touched on motivation a little last week, saying how you don't deserve to feel motivated. And it's true. Why should some 5-minute bs video be able to give you all the courage you ever need? If that were the case then success would be common amongst everyone.\n\nMy **old habit** of following the scam of motivation used to go:\n\nfeel motivated -&gt; do the thing partially -&gt; feel demotivated -&gt; discontinue thing because I \"lost interest\" -&gt; feel incapable of sticking to something -&gt; don't bother starting again until motivated.\n\n**Instead**, now:\n\nnot particularly motivated -&gt; do the thing -&gt; complete the thing -&gt; get positive feedback about thing -&gt; think \"I'm pretty good at this\" -&gt; internally motivated a little to continue - &gt; do the thing again.\n\nWhat do you think has served me the best out of the two cycles?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What's currently holding me back?**\n\n1. Not being strict enough with my routine\n2. Being semi-addicted to daydreaming\n\nThere was certainly more I noticed this past week, but these were the biggies\n\nI have a routine that I probably stick to with a 40% success rate. This is better than 0%, but I need to work on it.\n\nWork makes it difficult to be rigid (especially since my shift timings are all over the place), but I need to put in more effort regardless. The only thing I'm truly strict with is sleep, meditation, and workout times.\n\nA also get too carried away in thoughts. I'd like to say that they are positive because they enhance my creativity and whatever tf bs excuse I come out with, but they're not. Lots of them distract me from my work, and the beauty of the present moment, and just makes me feel a lot worse some of the time.\n\nI've noticed:\n\n* having nice daydreams makes you less likely to want to come back to reality, so when you do it feels dull and it puts you down\n* having bad daydreams of nasty shit or whatever just makes you straight up feel worse lol.\n\nThe only time I've felt a positive outcome from the use of imagination is when I have intentionally used it to attach a positive emotion to a certain affirmation or belief.\n\nI'm a bit of a daydream addict if I'm being real. It's something I still need to work on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My plans for next week**\n\n1. Continue with daily disciplines\n2. Read and retain more of the information I consume\n3. Write 2 more articles and more Reddit posts\n4. Compliment 1 person every day (this one makes me feel anxious, I can't lie)\n\nBeing disciplined with my daily tasks is becoming easy now, which is great. Especially considering I could barely hold it together for a week when I kept trying before. It's now almost been an entire month.\n\nI'm enjoying this writing stuff. I feel demotivated and hesitant at times, but just do the shit anyways. When resistance or doubt creeps in, I automatically think: \"Who am I becoming?\", \"This is a test for me to complete to transcend\", \"this is nothing but self-sabotage at play\", \" Seize the day\", etc.\n\nHaving this arsenal to defend myself against... well, myself I suppose, is one of the most vital things that has allowed me to keep going thus far.\n\nI'm not the most socially adept person on Earth so complimenting people will be interesting. I look forward to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A quote for the week that I liked:**\n\n&gt;*The true man is revealed in difficult times - Epictetus*\n\nI'm still reading Discourses and Writing Tools (more so discourses) at the moment. The more I read it, the more I enjoy it. Some of it is initially quite difficult to grasp, so I'll reread it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Anything else?**\n\nMy writing speed is quite poor, so I have started to train my typing speed and I'm learning to touch-type (yes, I use my index fingers to type lmfao). This, I think, is a pretty good idea.\n\nSee you next week.",

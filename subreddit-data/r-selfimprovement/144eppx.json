Problem is idk where to find them...How can I find new friends as an adult? I'm 30.\n\nI thought abt joining communities but struggle to find communities that fit my interest, bcs now that I think abt it...I don't have that many interest sadly. I am interested in language learning though and I am currently obsessed with two languages. I did join a polyglot community facebook page but that's all...Will paying for a class be worth it? (I self study)\n\nI thought abt joining sports club too, I'm currently still looking for one near my area, so I guess that's one more thing I can try...\n\nThat's all I can think abt right now...Any advice? I am literally clueless..",

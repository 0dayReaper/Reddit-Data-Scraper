    "postText": "(15F)Not exactly sensitive in the way people online see sensitive, but I get sad by the smallest things(I don't really get angry, though). For some examples. Whenever things do not go perfect, I get sad and start thinking about how happy and perfect they could have been. When I was little, I always felt everything had feelings, even inanimate objects. This morning I ate 10 eggs of egg whites. My mom told me it was fine and my dad would make more tomorrow but later made a joke about somebody eating all of them and I felt really guilty. I'm especially sensitive to children and animals, and I feel really bad about showing anything but pure kindness to them because I feel like all of them are pure and innocent creatures who only want love and should be treated the best possible, even though I know kids need discipline. I feel really bad about missing out on things especially, because I'll miss out on one thing and suddenly think that thing would have been the most amazing precious perfect pure loving thing ever and I just wasted that time and then I hate myself because I'm not pure or precious. I get really upset when somebody doesn't like me and I always feel self conscious because even if people don't like me I want them to think very neutral thoughts about me. I'm pretty bad socially and it makes me come off rude sometimes and I hate that. I wish I could be pure and innocent and precious and stuff. I don't know, maybe this is unimportant and just a human thing or whatever but it makes me sad =(",

It will be very difficult to not see things happening in front of you. But you might have to change the way you look at things. Hope you get good help.",

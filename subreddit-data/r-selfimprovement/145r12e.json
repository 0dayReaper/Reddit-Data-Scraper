Another great habit is setting aside time for personal growth, like reading or listening to podcasts that inspire you. Don't forget to incorporate physical activity into your routine, even if it's just a short walk. Lastly, make sure to practice self-care and prioritize your well-being. Take breaks, do things you enjoy, and be kind to yourself.\n\nAnd if you ever feel unmotivated to do any of it, Check out this app called Forfeit. It's not an ad or anything, just a cool app that can help you stay accountable. Basically, you set a task or goal, and if you don't provide evidence of completing it, you lose some money.",

I think the best habit is making the mental habit of choosing habits most helpful to the current problems you have. \n\nIn general though, one habit I\u2019d reccomend everyone is getting your sleep schedule straight. That sets it all up.",

            "comment": "\u201cGood habits\u201d are situational. If you don\u2019t understand why to do something you won\u2019t know when to stop. \n\nYou might start with what is actually \u201cgood\u201d for you. I would say it\u2019s possessing certain qualities, a moral character. An interesting conceptualization, what\u2019s good for one is good for all people. \n\nProbably the most important skill is learning how to think and inspect your judgments, aka critical thinking. That comes with challenging your perspectives, either reading, writing, talking to others. Lots of ways to get to the same aim.",

It\u2019s given me a good physique, better sleep, motivated me to fix my diet, and even made some friends through the gym. I did weightlifting since I was skinny and wanted to put on muscle, but you can do anything you want. It can be playing sports, jogging, yoga, hiking. Exert yourself physically and your body will reward you. \n\n\u201cIf exercise could be packaged in a pill, it would be the single most widely prescribed and beneficial medicine in the nation.\u201d",

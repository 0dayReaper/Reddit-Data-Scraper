You\u2019ve done something completely remarkable for yourself and it\u2019s all because you believed in yourself. You kept going when you were weighed down by your mental health. Let me tell you as someone who has gone through major depression fighting through it is one of the most badass and empowering things you can ever do for yourself. Please never give up and remember  that you\u2019re always where you\u2019re supposed to be. Well done my friend.",

There are way more competent people out there for weight loss tips but i found that not sleeping most of everyday helps a ton when it comes to weight loss. Haha. Also, just start with little things. 10 minute walks on treadmills. I found a job im on my feet at. I am slowly chsnging my diet. Ill choose diet instead of soda or just water one day. Its small changes that make big ones. As for motivation, i found being grateful oncreased my mood which increased how i felt about myself which helped me want to feel even better.

I've read in some of your responses that it's mainly gratitude?\n\nPersonally, I've heard \"Just be confident.\" one too many times and I'm sick and tired of it. I never knew what it meant to be confident and how one could become confident. I was always labeled as the \"shy one\", the \"quiet one\", the \"cautious one\". Now I know that I can be different, but it's been a journey, and I still got a ways to go. But the biggest thing for me was growing up in a world where it seemed like you had to be confident to get somewhere, and that I couldn't be that. And I refuse to accept that there's no other way or that I can't change and find my own way, so now I'm exploring fear and confidence. And any time when it feels like it's getting too much I say to myself: \"I may be scared now, but I'll find a way. Somehow I'll get to where I want to be.\"",

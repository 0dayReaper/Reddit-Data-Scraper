    "postText": "I'm 21 and 1 thing changed my life this year  \nIt wasn't hitting a goal, it wasn't shifting my mindset, it wasn't Chat GPT  \nIt was making my bed  \nSounds stupid, right? But hear me out:  \nEver since I was young, I never understood the importance of making my bed.  \nI always thought I'm going to get back into it later why do I need to make it now?  \nI had the wrong idea  \nAfter reading Atomic Habits by James Clear  \nI learned that goals weren't holding me back but my habits were  \nThat's when I discovered the hidden power of making my bed \ud83d\ude02  \nThis simple change has helped me balance school, work, friends, and the beginning of my entrepreneurial journey with my AI productivity newsletter. The Edge   \nSince success isn't a one-time thing, why would you set a one-time goal?  \nThis approach completely changed my life and how I increased my productivity this year.  \nChanging habits can be a daunting task after all they are habits for a reason  \nSo I learned the best method is to start changing with something that you do daily, and everyone wakes up and gets out of bed.  \nThis allows you to build a foundation of change  \nThis made it easier to stack habits on top of your new habit  \nThis simple task has now allowed me to build the confidence I needed to tackle bigger habits or tasks.  \nThis simple change has helped me balance school, work, friends, and the beginning of my entrepreneurial journey with my AI productivity newsletter.  \nChange is a process, and in order to reach your goal you must change your habits to create a new system (A new you if you will)  \nSuccess is a continuous process of improvement.  \nIt doesn't have to be making your bed, it can be anything simple that is tied to something you already do.  \nMaybe every morning floss for an extra minute  \nOr after your coffee say a quick prayer for what you are thankful for  \nIt is up to you  \nI encourage anyone struggling with reaching goals or taking action to read Atomic Habits by James Clear to change your perspective and become a more productive version of you!",

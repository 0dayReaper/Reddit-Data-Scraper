    "postText": "I'm a 20 year-old-guy and I'm very far behind in life and I'm trying to catch up. I've started going to the gym, losing some weight, trying to be more social. But all my problems seem to stem from my mentality. All my friends tell me that I need to change how I think and what I believe, and I know and understand that better than anyone, but I can't get the changes to stick... Sure I can sit and feel positive and optimistic about something or the future, but it crumbles when something goes wrong and I revert back to my normal way of thinking about myself and life in general. I feel like I'm annoying and a burden asking my friends and talking to them about it, but I don't know who else to turn to, so I'm just putting this out here and seeing what happens. Any advice at all is appreciated and I'll answer any questions you have. Thanks.",

            "comment": "OP, changing from inside to outside is the biggest challenge. Leaving bad concepts, prejudice and biased perspectives behind is far from trivial.\n\nIt's easy to say _\"you need this, you need that\"_. But it's hard to understand that our current behavior or perspective is derived from a sum of factors, many of them completely out of our control\n\nThat being said, I'd suggest the following: one thing at a time. Pick one aspect of you that you would like to change and, then, work on it. It's not like in the movies, there's no cute song playing in the background, while a rich collage of images flow through your mind. There's only....work.\n\nThat's it: one thing at a time. Pick one, respect yourself and fight to become the change you need. Not for others",

All the time, we are being bombarded with negativity in ads, insta reels, the news, internet in general. Even some songs are about failure, sadness, failed love. Change the content you consume.",

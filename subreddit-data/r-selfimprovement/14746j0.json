So I\u2019ve always searched for meaning. And well sometimes I feel like I get answers. \n\nThis was just in a discord server and someone asked the question above. I\u2019m not one to usually put my thoughts out there, but this is all a part of my self improvement too I assume. He seemed to be appreciative of the message so maybe this might help others.\n\nLet\u2019s begin. \n\nThe important first step is recognizing your thought and desire to change and being appreciative of that fact. Thoughts are like waves and build off eachother fueling the thought after. But you are not your thoughts. You are the master behind them.\n\nYou control their fate.\n\nThe most important thought is your next one.\n\nBut you\u2019re gonna be on a self journey. Only you truly will be able to grasp your own meanings. And people like us are here to guide you to your own freedom. Your fullest potential, but we cannot give you the answer. Only the path. So don\u2019t ever expect someone to change your life it\u2019ll never happen. It starts with you and will always be you.\n\nSelf improvement is a calling some will never answer. It will never end as there is no beginning. You simply recognize that process and act out of love towards it.\n\nYou better learn to love the process or you\u2019ll be disappointed you never reach the end. Only you understand exactly what you were made for, and that\u2019s to rise time and time again. To the fullest of your ability. If you can do that you will forever leave an extraordinary impact on the world moving forward. Propelling all of us simultaneously.\n\nYou will uncover that truth on a deeper and deeper level time and time again. You\u2019ve already begun the first step. Congrats you got this I believe in you.",

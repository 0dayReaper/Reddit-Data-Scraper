    "postText": "Quit gaming and porn a long time already, now I\u2019m going to beat my YT addiction.\n\nI beat my gaming addiction by realizing games were pointless, since gaming was a novelty and playing by myself I viewed as sad. So I just stopped playing by filling my time and realizing games were boring.\n\nPorn was by just seeing the benefits of Nofap and also affirming I hated porn as it was a novelty, a farce.\n\nYoutube\u2019s harder to beat since I am reprogramming my views to see it as something boring but its also very useful for information too\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve gotten blockers, but I use it to fill less lonely and thats it.",

I've unsubbed to most useless  content creators, keeping the informative like Vsauce, Tom Scott and Veritasium and the occasional Lemmino video. Tho I still struggle with just using the search bar and getting quick dopamine that my brain is so addicted to. May I ask how you fill your time? I spend hours a day on YouTube and wouldn't know what else to do. It's programmed into me.",

So you can set it to send a screenshot of your screentime with YT time below 1 hour a day, for example, or you lose $10. For me it works even better than app blockers, so maybe you should try it out.",

Although the initial detox wasn\u2019t a breeze, I\u2019ve had much worse experiences in the many many detoxes that I now have under my belt. So I embraced this and continue to remind myself not to take it for granted. So day 2 of detox and I\u2019m down in the kitchen making my breakfast and ice coffee I get this very abstract and out of the blue thought that was completely unrelated to the goosebumps and hot flashes I was pondering on. It was literally just the words \u201cgive yourself 50 days of clean time and you\u2019ll find a reason to continue it within those 50 days. I\u2019ve quit before but I wasn\u2019t ready, but there will never be a perfect time, just more time elapsed until the next bag if I don\u2019t make a decision. I\u2019ve gradually been pushed upwards more and more. So I said I\u2019m gonna do it. Now on day 11 I woke up feeling too good. I told myself, this is too good to be this good. You\u2019re going to be tempted to get high today, I just knew it I\u2019ve been doing this shit for so long. And it happened, a random encounter with a friend who had some roxy30s probably fent pressed but let\u2019s be real Ive banged 3 drugs in the same shot before, I kinda lost morals a long time ago and eating a little blue pill that\u2019s gonna make me knod out once and not be high after I wake up, isn\u2019t really a threat to me. And also didn\u2019t sound appealing and I was able to deny respectfully and walk away since they had no idea of my mission and I wasn\u2019t exactly quiet about my addictions after awhile. Anyway sorry for the long ass comment. Love you, keep going, Jah Bless\u2764\ufe0f good luck",

So those of us that are lucky enough not to die whilst doing so have the responsibility to do great things with that opportunity. \n\nMany friends I knew are gone. I pass over their family on social media now and again and think about what my family would have experienced had I passed too.\n\nToday I wake up and spend every minute of my day dedicated to making a difference in the world for the better. Albeit, in my own way and with my own business. But that\u2019s the beauty of capitalism. Before years of dying inside I NEVER would have had the balls to start a business, let alone the persistence to push through and actually become successful.\n\nI have a moral obligation to those that died not to waste my life. It\u2019s so important to remember this fact, and keep that gratitude. And it also helped me to remember that we can\u2019t really live until we *know* that one day we\u2019re going to die.\n\nYeah, Tyler Durden.",

If you haven\u2019t heard about the \u201crat park\u201d in your treatment centers or wherever you got clean, look it up. It\u2019s about an experiment done with rats, showing that the primitive side of addiction can be beat. The gist of the lesson is that we don\u2019t use when we enjoy our lives. Focus now on creating a life you enjoy living (ie: a purpose). \n\nOh and contrary to what those hardcore nuts in AA and NA may say, that purpose does NOT have to be AA and NA. It can be anything that is productive for your future and you enjoy doing. Mine ended up being finishing my college degree, then starting a business.\nNot that the rooms don\u2019t help when you really need them, but for me, they did more harm them good after a while. They\u2019re not for everyone, but some sort of spiritual belief and a reason for living *is*, IMO.",

Depression is can be caused by factors outside of your control like being in lockdown for 2 years, cancer diagnosis, secondary to other disease; or it can flat out be that the brain isn\u2019t making enough of a neurotransmitter.

With my therapist I talk about my deep feelings, my subsconscious actions and things like that. With my RD I talk about my food and how to organize my meals. \nI always eat breakfast, am snack, lunch + dessert, pm snack, dinner + dessert. that way my body doesn't feel restricted, i don't feel the need to binge because i know i'll have a meal in a few hours, and i eat enough to get my period back. \nmy brain needs structure right now to recover from binge/restrictive cycle, and honestly it is working!!",

So, while I can partially agree with you, \"just don't eat\" is a terribly fragile and unnuanced advice that fails to account for dozens of obstacles that inevitably come up during the weight loss journey. \n\nI recommend the r/loseit subreddit, which is dedicated to fighting obesity in long-term and sustainable ways while avoiding a lot ot bullshit that comes from self-proclaimed fasting gurus. For examples of influencers that both successfully lost a lot of weight and vocally discourage the \"*braindead fasting for the sake of it*\" approach, there's also ObeseToBeast and Michelle McDaniel.",

I definitely *could not* control everything else. (Still can\u2019t, as it happens.)\n\nConsider this. If you find yourself constantly thinking about what to eat, or what you don\u2019t get to eat, or how much to eat, or when to eat, or tracking what you eat, are you really in control of food? \n\n[And for the people in the comments saying  \u201cControl \u2260 restriction\u201d I submit to you: orthorexia. Which was my first stage of serious recovery, as is the case for many anorexics. So you\u2019re getting enough calories, sure. But what are you eating? Not much! Gluten free, dairy free, no fried food, no artificial or added sweeteners, limited oil and only extra virgin, no pastries, no fast food, low carbs/no carbs/carb cycling, calorie moderation in proportion to physical activity, no pasta, no pizza, no potatoes, no fruit\u2026 It restriction in a different way. It transfers the obsession into the quality over the quantity. It keeps you alive. But you\u2019re still a slave to thoughts of food.]\n\nBe honest with yourself now. Do you even really *want* to devote a significant part of your finite time in this life to thinking about, of all things in the vast universe, the next thing you\u2019re going to chew and eventually shit out? \n\nAnd, if not, how can you be in control of *everything* when you\u2019re not even in control of your mind?\n\nThe only thing food-control taught me is now to ignore my own pain and exhaustion. Which is not the point of pain\u2014or life. Your body tells you when you\u2019re in discomfort so you can address it via changing the circumstances that are causing the pain. We evolved to be able to do that. And now we are trying to convince ourselves that peak human performance is ignoring the same impulses that have taken our bodies this far. Pain can be physical, emotional, or mental. And until you root that out and heal it, everything else is, at best, a bandaid, or, at worst, self-flagellation to no end and with no point. \n\nTeaching yourself to suffer is believing that you should.",

I only spiral from there, becoming more acutely aware of everything else that's out of control in my life.\n\nso yes, while having a handle on your diet boosts self-discipline and gives you a stronger sense of trust in yourself.  I wouldn't say it's the most healthy way to gauge your self-discipline.  try making your bed, cleaning your room, having a consistent workout, going to bed early/waking up at dawn.  implementing these good micro habits contribute the most toward having a balanced, controlled life, where you no longer fall victim to your fleeting emotions and whims, rather have reign over them.\n\na restrictive diet can contribute to that, but it's not very sustainable.  and when you fail to reach that standard (which at times, you will)  you'll feel as if everything is crumbling.  try implementing  healthy consistent habits, not restrictive ones.  otherwise, ironically, you'll end up feeling enslaved by them, rather than freed.   still, to each is own :)  like I said, even if it's not the healthiest, I still do it, I just wouldn't recommend it for others.",

I think the evolutionary perspective on food is not only to diversify the source of foods (to eat a rich and diverse diet), but also to appreciate the evolutionary role of feasts and prolonged possible famines.\n\nIn our evolutionary past, human beings could go long periods without food, then have to gorge on a quick source (pg. 89). Because each farming season can yield more or less food, some cultures have learned to feast in years of excess as to prioritize extra food going to the community and NOT to new babies, to avoid the risk of more children going hungry on famine years (pg. 87). Our biology is also designed to store energy in fat for later use.\n\nBasically, now that 24/7 grocery store food is no longer scarce, in modernity, many are no longer accustomed to fasting rituals (excepting religious rituals like Ramadan). So maybe there is something to seeking out periods of hunger to build endurance or maybe spiritual appreciation for abundance",

I did loose a lot of weight, now I\u2019m going back because of personal issues, gained 50lns and now getting back on track. 90% is eating, 10% is just simple workouts. I do 15min of jogging not too intensive and weights 5 times a week but 30 min and I focus on major and  compound muscles  and very very slow reps to feel the burn for most effectiveness but not too much , but enough to have a bit of sweat, same with jogging, just a bit of sweat. I wouldn\u2019t go crazy on working out too much for general health and weight loss and normal Body transformation. We focus so much on working so hard and then we feel guilty if we eat something or over eat. Fasting helps, but I use fasting more like spreading my meals a few times a day and try to spread fasting between 3-4 hours in between instead of just fasting straight 8-16 hours a day or something, it depends how heavy you ate the day before and if your still hungry the next day. Usually I eat evenings late andfast until next day around 2-3 pm and break my fast. It depends on your lifestyle, I usually like to focus on mental work in day like reading and professional work and evenings for working out at gym and eating and sleeping. If your a night shift worker, maybe gym and sleeping and eating in day is better for you and fast at night while working. I rather have my fat being burned  or muscles burning calories for me while im sitting in day doing mental work, casue it\u2019s easier. I watch videos on exercise and they say to do weight lifting and then cardio for  30min-1hour right after, to burn more fat, it doesn\u2019t matter, we all know in the end it\u2019s calories in and calories out, of there is a slight difference in burning more calories in one way then another, do we really need to work extra effort to do that ? Naaaah, keep it simple, just like brushing teeth, don\u2019t start with the hardest part of teeth like in back, start with front and move your way to back, simple. Hope this helps.",

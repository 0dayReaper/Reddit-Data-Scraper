It doesn't have to even be productive, just something to get you up.\n\nExample: \"wake up at 7AM and go for a 15 minute walk then eat breakfast\"\n\nMake that non-negotiable! If you want to go back to sleep after, allow yourself however, there's a good chance that could help you kick start your day. :)",

Plus giving myself an additional 30 minutes to brush my teeth and get ready i need roughly an hour to poop. So 2.5 hours would mean I would have to be on the toilet by 5:30. In that case I\u2019ll set my alarm for 5:00, 5:30, 5:45. The time differences for me are enough so that if I hit snooze, even though it\u2019s a bad habit I know i should stop doing; I\u2019m still giving myself enough time to be there on time and if I get there early that\u2019s even better.",

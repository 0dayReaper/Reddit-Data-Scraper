    "postText": "Hey reddit,\n\nI am sick of being so lazy. I've been watching self improvement videos and read a couple of books passively over the last year, but it seems like nothing has been put into motion and my laziness is stronger than it's ever been.\n\nI want to go back to school to pursue becoming a teacher (before anyone says it, I live in Canada and it is paid pretty well). I need to complete some highschool university level credits before I apply for school in the fall to go to school in the fall of 2024. To be more specific, I need to complete 6 credits via an online highschool that is \"work at your own pace\" in 5-6 months. I know this is possible, but it is literally impossible if I keep procrastinating and being lazy.\n\nI especially don't want this habit to continue into university and I am ready to get fucking rid of this.. I'm sick of being lazy and unproductive. \n\nI wake up every morning and say to myself \"I should start doing this\" then follow it up with \"I can do it later\" and then I don't really get much of anything done. When I'm actually doing it, it's fine. Depending on the subject I'm doing, I actually enjoy some of it. I can't seem to stick to it. I couldn't imagine doing it every day for months either. I just don't think I'm capable of it, despite wanting to so bad.\n\nI'm lost. Does anyone have any advice for me? I'd appreciate it so much. ",

This will make your goals more tangible and easier to tackle.\r To add an extra layer of accountability, you could try using the Forfeit app. It's an app where you set tasks and attach a monetary forfeit. If you don't complete the task and provide evidence, you lose the money. It can help motivate you to stick to your schedule and overcome procrastination.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, it's okay to have off days or setbacks, but the key is to keep going. Stay focused on the bigger picture and remind yourself of the benefits that achieving your goals will bring. You have the desire to change and that's a great starting point.",

    "postText": "For a long time I've been stuck on this question and I've yet to find an answer that consistently encourages/motivates me to take action. Why do I want those goals or any goals?\n\nOften times I find asking myself \"why?\" I'm doing something has been terribly demotivating because it made me aware of the pointlessness of it by not having an actual answer to why I was doing it and the highly unlikely chance that it would ever occur.\n\nAlso much of the time the reason why can often boil down to \"because I like it\" but enjoyment is really inconsistent in my experience. One day I could be looking forward to something and the next day totally dreading it.\n\nE.g I was exercising regularly and not particularly enjoying it that day and I just tried to think of why I was bothering and it made me realize that I didn't really care about it. The original goal didn't particularly interest me anymore, I'm in generally good shape from my job, and it was just time wasted that I could spend doing other things so I just stopped and haven't exercised since.\n\nHow do you get around this issue of \"why\"? I don't really feel like I care about or enjoy anything consistently enough to find this a source of motivation or self discipline.",

Untill you understand that purpose that tought won't fade away. At least from my expirience and few others I know.",

From my expirience I can say that there is a small man operating in your brain, we call him Excuse governer and his only job is to keep you comfortable and safe. As soon as you start to strugle he tries to stop you any way he can. And it's okay if you haven't found your purpose, sometimes it can take 10, 20 40 years or whole life. Don't stress about it too much \ud83d\ude09",

You should be able to get an idea as to why you want to.\n\nDiscipline usually helps too with moments likes these",

    "postText": "I rarely have good looks, have no plan outside of the military and lack confidence. I thought that acting was my calling, but now it's too late and think I am not able to reach those heights anymore especially at my current age sadly. I am deeply in love with the art of films, but don't think I'll ever succeed in that category, so I'm just stuck existing with no purpose at all or ambitions to follow unfortunately as well.",

You \u201ccan\u2019t each those heights\u201d might not be true at all especially when your definition might be some kind of fame or economic result. \n\nIt seems you also have an \u201call or nothing\u201d view on this that either you have this specific fantasy come true or you can\u2019t do it at all. If someone likes music it be weird for them to stop because they didn\u2019t become a #1 artist because they want to play music. \n\nPlus, at least with acting, it be ridiculous to think they don\u2019t need roles of all ages, maybe that\u2019s just not the role you want to play and as an actor you have to realize that all roles in the ensemble are necessary for the project. If your focus is yourself and not the project why would anyone want to work with that kind of person in any field.",

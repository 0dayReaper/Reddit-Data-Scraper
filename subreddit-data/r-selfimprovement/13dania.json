Change the way you speak about yourself and you can change your life. What you're not changing, you're also choosing.\"\n\nI see a lot of people on here talking about how terrible they are and that they want to change. Try to stop talking about yourself that way and instead start communicating to yourself that you are the person you want to be and you will become it.",

It might not be for everybody, and at first it feels pretty silly to say things like \u201cI love myself, I\u2019m brilliant and confident\u201d but the way you speak is eventually the way you think. \n\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable with that just yet, try writing down 10 things you\u2019re grateful for each day. Maybe even try to focus on things about yourself (grateful for my kindness, my ability to see the best in people, my resilience, ambition, etc.). Once you start programming your brain to see the good instead of the bad, your mindset will change to one of abundance. \n\nOnce I started to default to \u201cI\u2019m pretty amazing\u201d instead of \u201cwow, I hate myself\u201d life just got a lot nicer. When something goes wrong, I know that I have the power to make it better, or at least to move on in peace. That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t have bad days, but I find it easier to come back to equilibrium since I\u2019ve improved my resilience.",

However, there is such power in words, and if we are constantly speaking curses over ourselves, it will indeed continue to be just as you say.  I think starting with being grateful - despite how bad things are - is the key.  Being grateful really gets the wheels going.  I started this practice about a month and a half ago, and i've seen such tremendous change!  Life is hard, but being grateful for all the little things in between can start to change things.",

    "postText": "I pretty much just finished a really good leg day session. Like close to passing out type of good. After I left the gym. I had this overwhelming sense of calm. And all of a sudden I felt like I was seeing things a lot clearer. \n\nLike alot of the things I stress about aren't really a big deal but with my thought process I turn them into big deals. \n\nAre there any ways to prolong this sense of calm and clarity? I've thought about meditation but I'm not sure. \n\nAny ideas?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the suggestions so far. It seems like meditation would be a good thing to start.\n\nEdit 2: I'm glad this helped a few people. Also thank you a lot for all the awards.",

The main gist of it is: taking examples from your life, understanding what your thoughts and feelings are, understanding why you are reacting that way, addressing the root cause, confronting that root cause. There is a bit more to it but I am not a professional, just someone who benefitted from it.",

            "comment": "Gym routines produce and regulate a set of neurotransmitters such as seratonin, and endorphins. Additionally weightlifting has a plethora of other benefits. Finally when finishing a hard workout you feel accomplished and particularly when fully pumped and exhausted but standing alive it's like the war is won for the day.\n\nFor meditation you will be fine with trying it out. Almost everyone recommends some form of mindfulness but the process for that is different than working out since mindfullness is about putting in directed effort but subtly to maintain focus/concentration/and sustain stable attention on a meditation object such as nostril breathing our mouth breathing. Of course the side effect of this is a relaxation on mind and body combined with the feeling of mental lightness as ones thoughts are observed like wispy strings. So the style is different then working out where working out is more about rae exertion. With that being said meditation is also in its own ways pretty exertion heavy and demanding but the long term benefit is relaxation, mental alertness, and positive sensations. \n\nGive it a shot.\n\n\nWhen doing meditation create a routine similar to working out. Do not force progression based on minutes of feelings of sensations. The goals should be that of a beginner so every 6-12 weeks you can change the regiment and style. For the beginner stages the only thing one should worry about I'd some consistency which is 3-5 times per week at a rate of max 30 mins spaced out throughout the day. After that one can develop longer sits and progression. Just use an app until 3-6 months and then ditch it for some textbooks or some skilled guides. The main thing is strive for effortlessness which means the session should not be filled with exertion. \n\nFinally I will say this. One caveat is that even though meditation does produce a calming sensation and cultivates various mind states don't try to cling to the feelings. Just focus on the process/practices.",

Any helpful textbook can do the trick. Do not recommend guided meditations unless one is skilled or advanced since imo it develops attachment to the person who is guiding.

The 1st few miles sucks (everything feels janky and sloppy and hurty).. but once I get into the \"flow state\" where everything is moving nicely (about Mile 3 or 4).. it just feels great. \n\nAfter a good long walk,.. getting a shower and a healthy meal into me (and a good 8 or 9 hours of sleep) just feels amazing.",

I wasn't a marathon runner or some \"pinnacle of fitness\".. but I wasn't some lazy couch potato either. (I'm looking back at my Apple Activity data from 2018 and 2019.. but it's kind of hard going day by day to get an idea of what my averages were at the time.. I'd probably have to pull API calls or export the data somehow to really get a better idea). \n\nThe doctors at the time honestly were a bit unsure why my case was so severe. Course this was back in late Feb/March of 2020.. so SARS-COV2 was pretty new at the time and the phrase \"there's a lot we still don't know\" was pretty true (even though that's something you really don't want to hear a Doctor say :)\n\nWhen I was in ICU.. I was not only battling Covid19.. but I also had an ecoli infection in my Bladder and septic through my entire blood stream. (later research would show that Covid19 is NOT primarily a respiratory infection.. but rather a \"entire circulatory system infection\", it infects the endothelial lining of blood-vessels).. so Doctors think I went into \"cytokine storm\" (immune system overdrive).. which kind of cascaded downwards and started harming all my bodies systems which is what made my ICU experience so near-deadly. (How I even pulled out of that to survive.. I still honestly don't know. My vitals were so poor and borderline unreadable at one point,. they were asking my family about \"removing life support\" and had already scheduled workplace-therapists to be on site Monday morning for my coworkers because they assumed I wouldn't make it through the weekend.) Thankfully I did. \n\nWhy all of that happened to me?.. still really don't know. I am Blood Type A+ (again.. research is showing Covid19 is more severe on A's.. and blood type O is \"more protective\"). It's also seemingly more severe on Males. While I'm not in any high risk age groups, I am older (near 50). If there's some underlying condition (or genetic factor) there,. I'm not aware of it. \n\nI do have my DNA up in 23&amp;Me.. so it would be interesting if they do find some genetic predisposition or marker.. I have my DNA sequence in TXT format I can search through to cross-reference. (although my 23&amp;Me scan was done quite a while ago on \"Gen3\" machines.. I think they're up to Gen5 or Gen6 now.. so I really need to do a re-sample. )",

Our survival instinct is incredibly strong and compelling...it's compelling because it's able to enlist the help of emotions.\n\nThe goal, for me, is to create space between the thought/emotion from hell and the story I proceed to tell myself right afterward. Stoicism, Buddhism, and even RET (precursor to CBT) doesn't ever claim that your life will be roses and you'll walk around the earth in a state of bliss. Not even the Buddha did this.\n\nIt is to stop focusing on the negativity of the matter at hand (no matter what it might be and no matter how terrible) and understand that *it's the story you tell about the thing* that is the problem. It's latching onto a thought and riding it until it grows into a gigantic flood of crap.\n\nAccept that you will feel like shit from time to time. But *practice* to put space there and find the moment to catch yourself before you spiral out of control. Eventually, you'll be able to let the thoughts and feelings pass. But it is really hard work. \n\nI think, again for me, my biggest problem is that I somehow have come to believe that I am god. That I know everything about everyone's thoughts and motives, that I can predict the future, and that I have a degree of control over people and nature itself.\n\nIn that space between thought/emotion and the next step of choice between continuing with the story or stopping it dead in its tracks...THAT is where you have to remind yourself that you don't know everything...and whatever you might be thinking about anything at all, is probably wrong or sensationalized or made into a catastrophe. \n\nThe stoics dwelled on death (including the death of one of their own children) in order to remind themselves that death is a thing. It sucks, and sometimes it sucks really hard, but we should never be surprised by it. That just shows the extremes to which they went to see that THE STORY\u2122 is what makes things shitty.\n\nFeelings will come and feelings will go...you can choose to stop making up a bed for them to stay for an extended visit.",

You might never become the Buddha, and even if you do, you\u2019ll experience everything you do now, but that story in your head will help you realize once again and progressively more frequently that hey, everything will be ok.

                    "comment": "Even if the thoughts collectively come to form a story it's the obsession with clinging to a particular set of outcomes that relate to a story that story is a vital part of the survival engine. One issue I've thought of relating to this is the stoics and the advanced buddhists contemplated emptiness and suffering or death constantly though philosophy and in depth meditation. The thing is most people in the world operate under trying to improve circumstances, live a good life, and improve their material conditions to increase their chance of success and happiness or at least conditions that satisfy happiness. The story we tell ourselves is partially narrative driven but that's also how we know where we are on the map of action and what to do next. Focusing on the present is hard if the future isn't so bright and the past is dark. If feelings came and went so fleeting how can one form any significant relationships, work together, or have the vision to start projects, make scientific advancements, make societal and structural changes that are necessary to make ones life or the order better. \n\nOn the part related to everything you know is probably wrong sensationalized or made into catastrophe. I mean how can you know that is the case and that certain outcomes are not catastrophe. For instance let's say you catch covid and you are immune compromised with a liver condition. Without the vaccine there is a massive risk since I'm in a risk group and people were foolish enough to not even wear masks in some states. That's a direct risk which I have to calculate for every time I make a call to go out and plan a lot. I can be mindful in my house where I maintain some degree of control but when going outside if somebody doesn't wear a mask and has covid spreading the virus that's gonna cause fear or panic if I follow the trail to it's conclusion. Person sneezes - might get covid - get covid -  complications-life is hard and blows. Fear is unintentionally risk calculation. It's why I don't choose to ride a motorcycle even though it's fun as hell. \n\n\nPeople say life is like a game but in games I get a badass character in a game ranked exactly at my difficulty with do overs, power ups, multiple weapons, and potentially an avatar that looks nothing like me where I have significantly more freedom and a very clear goal. In games we have a limited sense of control which is what makes it active and fun. Similarly in good shows typically the mc has to overcome some challenges which is why heroes journey stories are so popular and enticing since it follows the formula of progression. I love the idea of just watching thoughts to get a sense of distance and objectivity but being detached 24/7 is a bit difficult in interpersonal dynamics. \n\n\nIf you have come to view yourself as a god then you should be able to answer this question. Why not try to extend your life as much as possible. People say death is inevitable but why not work on anything related to ai, robotics, health, genetics research to skirt death. Seems like that's the natural conclusion if one realizes that our time here is finite then shoot for extending it so our conciousness last as long as we can. \n\n\nI recall once a long time ago I had a liver condition and went to the hospital almost dying. As I came back I was only focused on surviving till the next day and read some anime about heroes/anime characters and used that as fuel to continue living. That was enough even when I felt internally alonw. Sometimes I wonder as I got older what is it that I forgot.",

I am catholic myself, but feel that a lot of the basic principles align with my personal beliefs and I have a lot to gain from learning about Buddhism. Maybe just check it out and see what they're all about",

Even if the workout/run absolutely sucked and left me beat up, mentally I feel good and fresh.\n\nMy best advice would be to partition your time. When you\u2019re working dedicate yourself to it, but also when you\u2019re resting, commit fully to that as well.\n\nWhen you don\u2019t feel the need to share attention between work and rest, I find it helps you slow down and feel calmer overall.",

I am considering building an app to reinforce these behaviors, because it's different for everyone and I think journaling can help remind us of those good things so we can come back to it. Interestingly, meditation was not something that worked for me. Perfume, however, was, so I started a perfume brand for mental health and mindfulness.",

All the problems/thoughts that were weighing on me dissolve and I just feel complete contentment. \n\nI sometimes experience this as a result of getting up too fast haha, where there isn't enough blood in my brain or something to fuel my mind, and I become really aware of my body (having to stabilize myself on my feet) and sometimes the mind starts to rush back in and I feel intense fear - like it can't be that easy to feel that good, there must be a problem. I try to remain in that connection to my body for as long as possible, but the mind inevitably reasserts itself.\n\nAs mentioned by someone else here already the Wim Hof Method has a similar effect on me and can move me into these states of euphoria and contentment. Definitely worth checking out.\n\nThanks for the post! I hope this makes sense to those reading!",

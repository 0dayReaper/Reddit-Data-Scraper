To stay motivated, find activities you enjoy, set clear goals, and consider using the Forfeit app for some extra accountability. It\u00b4s an app which you need to send an evidence completing a habit, or you lose money. Remember, change takes time, so be kind to yourself and celebrate small wins along the way.",

I quit with chantex if anyone's desperate to quit, I recommend chantex as a side for therapy. I feel like I should pursue my dreams of just writing a few songs. I don't play nearly enough music. I rarely deliberately practice, mostly noodling. What I'm getting at here is, I replaced nicotine with my phone, and now I don't play music enough, I'm terrible.",

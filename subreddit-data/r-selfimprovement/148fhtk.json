Imagine if some other person, a stranger to you, had all of your characteristics, habits, quirks, behavior, etc. What would you say about them?\n\nI found, for instance, I had much less tolerance for my messiness when I imagined it as someone else's messy habits.",

What you've achieved is the same as millions of other men. If you want to be special, you're going to have to keep working hard.\n\nAnd if you're already working hard, you're going to have to work harder.\n\nYou know how to practice and you know how to learn. That's good.\n\nNow take those skills and target your insecurities.\n\nAnd if you're in Hustler University, drop that shit immediately because it's probably what's making you insecure. \n\nYou currently feel like you've made it. Hit the peak. \n\nShit doesn't last. Life is gonna change and you're not going to have the tools to deal with it. You have to learn them.\n\nAnd if your ego can't handle it, it's going to be very painful. A lot of people never get past it.\n\nIf you want to come in this sub with an ego that's like a balloon one breathe away from popping, you're gonna encounter a lot of needles.\n\nEither get better at balling or tone it down. \n\nI give a lot of advice on this sub, but I also learn a lot - even from people who think they're totally lost.\n\nThat's how you do self-improvement, not by periodically coming down from the mountain to preach the good word.",

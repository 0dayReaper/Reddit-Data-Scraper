    "postText": "Whether it\u2019s getting cheated on, or losing in a board game, that feeling of losing can be so intense and overwhelmingly crippling. Losing has always been something I\u2019ve aimed to avoid in life. I\u2019m so afraid of the feeling that comes with losing that I lived my life coping with anxious avoidant attachment issues. One of the earliest memories I have is sitting in my room after losing something (I can\u2019t even remember what) at 4 or so years old and thinking to myself how much I hated losing and how I wanted to win and brag to everyone about it.\n\nI\u2019ve grown out of my bragging ways but I type this now because I just lost to my friend in golf by a measly 2 strokes for a measly $10 wager. I\u2019m now distancing myself from my friends for the post golf festivities cause I\u2019m overwhelmed by this shameful feeling that comes with losing. I used the example of getting cheated on in my first sentence because that feeling of \u201closing\u201d in the relationship has haunted me for years now and this feeling from losing a basic hour and a half round of golf brings me similar feelings. \n\nWhile I\u2019ve always just lived with the fact that I hate losing, I\u2019m just now realizing that my hatred for losing seems to be on another, rather unhealthy level compared to the normal person. I\u2019m wondering if anyone out there has any relation, rebuttal, or advice in response to this post.\n\nTldr: Losing in any way crushes me to an unhealthy extent.",

            "comment": "Well, if you consider loss only in a material sense then yeah I can see this but what about another way. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how short your fuse is for losing if you think you won. All that needs to change is your perception and values on what counts as a loss.\n\nIf you saw it as a loss to brag, you\u2019d stop. Same thing if you saw it as a loss to complain. That doesn\u2019t make it healthy, far from it that\u2019s repressive, but it would get you to act the way you desire and still feel the same way. \n\nWhat can you gain in loss? You ever see people who praise good sportsmanship? Maybe if you value your character more then you don\u2019t see these \u201closses\u201d as inherently a bad thing but see them as opportunities to gain character. \n\nIn reality you\u2019re starting on the back foot because you\u2019re calling them \u201closses\u201d, you already have that view so sit to work out what you value more, 2$ and saying you won or being a calm person. \n\nYou got to remember, your answer will change in different contexts which is what you\u2019re experiencing now. You think about it as bad but in the moment you see it as the only option. You\u2019re limited only to the options that\u2019s show up in your mind but the more you study and focus on your values the more readily it will appear when you need it. It\u2019s like a test, you\u2019re not gonna remember the answer if you don\u2019t study it and it\u2019s way easier to remember something you understand than it is to remember something that has no meaning at all.",

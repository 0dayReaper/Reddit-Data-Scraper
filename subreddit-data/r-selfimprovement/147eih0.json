    "postText": "It\u2019s been a long time coming, but it had to happen eventually.\n\nOn April 3, 2021, I sent my final message to my now ex-FWB, who I never even met in person, because our relationship only lasted about 8.5 months total, and it was entirely online because of COVID and our long distance from each other.\n\nFor the next 2 years, I had quite the phobia for simply being in the area that she lived in, because I was afraid I might run into her. Even though the best way I can describe our relationship was a FWB situation, we never actually put a label on anything, and she had a boyfriend who I think she was actually trying to cheat on with me. She also tried to make me think she was interested in me and would try to keep up the facade until I got the upper hand and just got out of that toxic relationship for good.\n\nA few months ago, my best friend and I agreed to go to our local Six Flags, because it\u2019s something we used to do together up until a few years before COVID (I was a Season Pass holder up until the end of the 2019 season). Because it\u2019s located in the same area as my ex-FWB, I thought about it, but ultimately decided to go with him, because it would allow us to hang out like we used to and I would finally put my fears to rest about running into the ex. I had started listening to music again that I had stopped listening to when I cut off contact with the ex in order to mentally prepare myself.\n\nAnd that brings us to last weekend. On June 10, my stepsister got married in a state about 3 hours away from where I live. I attended her wedding, and it was really nice. There were some other things I wanted to do that were somewhat nearby, and I spent pretty much the entirety of June 11 doing them. On my way back home, I realized that it would be taking me through the COUNTY in which my ex lives. I was very nervous and tried looking for alternate routes but they would be much slower, so I decided to just accept that this would happen. I drove through the county, and it really wasn\u2019t that bad. I had thought that I would not have been able to handle it well in the slightest, but that couldn\u2019t be further from what actually happened. I was able to keep my composure and I was surprised that I had been avoiding something for so long because of 1 person that I don\u2019t even talk to anymore (for good reason).\n\nI feel proud of myself for finally conquering pretty much the final hurdle in getting over my ex: Actually driving through her area (although unplanned) after avoiding it heavily for the last 2 years and thinking about avoiding it too.",

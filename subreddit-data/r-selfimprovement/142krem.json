    "postText": "My life is supposed to be good. I have a nice job, a place to stay, a lot of money saved up, and recently, an amazing relationship. \nI'm very grateful for this, but I'm very unhappy with my weight and my lifestyle.\nI've been trying to lose weight for a long time, but I failed all the time because it's very hard to do something consistent. I travel very often, I get out with friends, so I drink and eat out a lot. \nI've tried a personal trainer at gym, but I went for 3 weeks and then I stopped because I went on another vacation. \n\nMy question is: Is there any way to have some results without having to \"pause\" my life for years ? I could stay home and avoid any party for the next 2 years, but I just don't want to.",

Alcohol and soda do lead to weight gain, if you hang out 8 times in a month then consume alcohol at a small amount twice that month, then slowly stop and look for a much more healthy drink to consume. \nYou can still live a Normal life just reduce the ration, consume more fruits. Take a walk everyday if you don\u2019t want to exercise.",

            "comment": "Small improvements add up overtime, and it sounds like taking small steps may be the most accommodating to how busy your life is. I wonder if any of these may help for building up basic habits:\n- choosing more vegetables and protein over carb heavy options, for all meals of the day (including your groceries)\n- choosing water over any drink\n- if you need to drink alcohol, choose drinks with less carbs like plain rum, whiskey, vodka, etc. on the rocks\n- 30 minute body weight exercises at home that are challenging enough, done 3 days per week, on days of your choice as long as you hit 3. For example, I\u2019ve done 10 sets of: 10 push-ups and 10 jumping squats, so total of 100 each within 30 minutes. I\u2019ve tried doing just 50 burpees with breaks in between because I find them hard af lol. Life\u2019s been super hectic lately and I\u2019ve been doing a whole year of just 30 minute exercises 3-5 days a week, and it still makes a difference. Exercising doesn\u2019t have to be at a gym with equipment for 1+ hours. It could be at home (or hotel if travelling), using your own body weight, and for as little as half an hour.\n- remembering that consistency is key, and results take time. Even with small steps you will see results eventually. We are talking months. On days that you feel like you should give up your new habits because you think you\u2019re not seeing results, shake yourself out of it or else you\u2019ll be back to square one. Take before and after pictures if you have to.\n\nDuring times where you find more stability in your schedule, then up your game by actually going to the gym, being creative with your healthy meals, and researching or trying other habits to pick up for a healthy lifestyle. Or even researching more efficient at-home workouts that you can incorporate on your next busy bout. But whenever chaotic life ensues, revert back to operating on just your basics (such as the above points). Best of luck!!",

Go work out with friends, or make new friends who can help you learn exercises at the gym, or find someone to go on hikes or runs with, and then you will not have to choose between fitness and friends and you will both be mutually supporting each other. This is what I'm trying to do, especially since I can't afford a personal trainer! Best wishes It's great that you know what direction you want for your life",

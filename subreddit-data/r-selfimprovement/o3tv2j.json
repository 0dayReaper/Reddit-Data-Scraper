I was the only person running drive thru, taking inshop, and making sandwiches at Jimmy John's today. Today I got 2 orders wrong in a row and one of them was really angry, causing my manager to get mad at me and I lost my shit.. Not in front of the customers tho. It had to do with my managers attitude, but reflecting back, she's only 18 and probably having a hard time dealing with the stress also. I was about to walk out the door and breathe for a few but instead she told me to clock out and go home for the day. The people who are taking your order.. It may be day 6 of a 12-14 hour shift. Please understand and be kind and humble. It's a stressful time right now for everybody. Thanks.",

Sorry, we only know that salt is aisle 8, we don\u2019t know if we have this very specific brand of salt. Also, the person stocking the shelf does NOT determine what we sell. He\u2019s given a box and told where to stack the items that are inside.",

At one point, someone dropped an entire jug of grape juice (why, God?) and I had to mop it up. I instantly had a crowd of pissed customers berate me for not doing my job. It\u2019s unbelievable how pitiful some people are. Go the fuck outside and find yourself a cart. I\u2019m doing everything I can.",

Welcome to \\[restaurant\\], how may I help you?\"  She starts screaming at me about how she called 3 times and no one answered the phone.  I tried to explain to her that we were on the phone with another customer ordering catering, but she didn't want to hear it.  She literally just wanted to order curbside, which she could do so online...\n\nI don't get people like that personally.

The blame lies on the companies who aren\u2019t paying livable wages. Also, minimum wage doesn\u2019t increase overnight. It would be a slow scale up to whatever amount is agreed upon. So there isn\u2019t going to be an influx of EMT\u2019s quitting their jobs to go work fast food. There will be pushback by market pressures to raise EMT wages to accurately reflect the value of the work.",

None of this even is *new* human behavior; groups of people have always had things that they'll generally accept and not accept.\n\nIs that mob mentality? Potentially, or it's just an inevitable consequence of human society. Right or wrong, it's certainly not a question of \"the hive mind\" stifling conversation - it's just humans socializing.\n\nAnyway, plenty of people are still seeing the comment in question, I still saw it at -88 votes, so arguably it's still part of the conversation. People just don't think it's a statement that warrants much further discussion here, which is what the downvote button functionally does - folds the discussion, because it's potentially going to get off-track (or combative, etc). So it's working as intended.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with being a contrarian, until you start getting offended that people don't take your unpopular statements more seriously... Then you're starting to cross over into \"angry weirdo who turns everything into a free speech issue\" territory.",

Like sure I can see a ticket that says \"one pepperoni pizza, 3 sandwiches, and a salad\" and say \"hey, this bag only has like 2 sandwiches, something is missing or there was a mix up somewhere.\"  However, if a thing says \"one pepperoni pizza and a sandwich\" and the bag has one pizza and a sandwich, I can only assume that order is correct.  If I ask the people in the kitchen, they'll just say \"this order is correct.\"  I can't do much else, but the customer will take it out on you because you're the 'face' so to speak.\n\nAnother thing is that the customer will call like a million times, come in, see the shop is fairly empty, and yell at us for being lazy and not answering the phone.  Which from their POV is justified.  Except...  We couldn't answer the phone because the manager was on the restaurant phone taking a large catering order from someone, so no one could answer the phone.  She didn't see that, so she made assumptions.",

We're currently short staffed every day and hear the phone rings non stop from customers who didn't get this or that, some complain about our dry biscuits for some reason or they just play the card Ohhhhh I DiDn'T GeT My ChICkEN...Clearly we can tell the liars a mile away. We have one cook to feed over 1 thousand customers each day. It take 15 mins to prep and place chicken in the fryers. Our customers all think chicken just magically takes 1 minute to cook somehow. Our employees show up late or high, No Call No Show every week. I work 10 hr shifts 56+ hours a week. All day I hear grown customers act like toddlers. We are busy from 10am to 10 pm no break periods. I cover others shifts, work at two different locations. I will straight up thunder punch someone by 9 hours in. My employees get harrased constantly. Most my employees get a break when we can but some can't get a break being understaffed because apparently it's so difficult to feed your family at home. Popeyes is dang good I will admit it but people need to value family's health and family more than wasting money in fast food. The matter is that our society is really irresponsible with money and lazy. We're rude and understaffed and underpaid. Hope that clears it up, maybe tip your cashiers and watch them perk up or just a compliment goes a long ways. I'm a very positive person. Friendly and would gladly take care of my respectful and loyal customers. Sometimes we just have a bad long day and bare with us. I treat my employees with lots of respect and try to rid of any toxic behavior or drama. I encourage them to be better and to do better for themselves and applaud them every day I work.\n\nTLDR\n\nUNDERPAID \n\nCRAPPY CUSTOMERS.\n\nCHICKEN DOESN'T COME UP IN ONE MINUTE.\n\nRAW CHIKEN COOKS FOR 12 MINUTES .\n\nTENDERS AND NUGGETS TAKE 3 MINUTES TO COOK.\n\nCUSTOMERS ARE THE REASON WE ARE RUDE.\n\nSHORT STAFFED.",

The amount of complaints is equal to the amount of competence of it's workers 95% of the time. Good teams only got the complaints from the Karen's wanting free shit. While shit teams got the wrath of every time dick and Harry on the planet. \n\n I receive more tips than all my coworkers. And the reason is because I try my best to make sure the customer gets the best food possible. Ever get a 40$ tip on a 15$ pizza? I have.\n\nEver get a 5$ tip on a 15 minutes late pizza? I did because the customer saw I was unwilling to send out a terrible pizza and argued with a coworkers on it. \n\nWhen I worked McDonald's I would get phone numbers and tips for because I would make sure the food got made even if I had to leave my window to do it. And I was also nickednamed SpongeBob for my work ethic on said grill. I was trash on the table though. \n\nFact is the work you put in is the work you get out. Most the people who were lazy wound up hating the job more than the people with work ethic. \n\nBecause I know the pain of working fast food and retail. I tip based on the performance of who serves me. Once tipped a waitress at steak and shake 70$ because cleaned up the 12 tables before I even got my food.",

They see it as some kind of 'low-status' job so they view them that way and look down on them.\n\nYesterday, I was ordering from McDonalds and some of the orders took pretty long, including mine. I was hanging out with my friends and was one of the last few people to eat because of how long the order took. One of the orders were missing though, but instead of scolding or getting angry, I just decided to point it out clearly.\n\nBesides that, there were only 2 people working at that store, so they were probably struggling a lot working for long hours. Not saying they shouldn't listen to the orders or they don't need to get it right because they do need to, but because of the lack of staff it'd make sense that it would take a little more time than usual. \n\nSo sorry this happened to you. Everyone is stressed right now, and this brings so much more stress into this situation. I appreciate service workers for their hard work and dedication.",

I always try to treat them with respect and kindness even if i have to wait 20minutes for my order cause I can put myself in their shoes. I think fast food workers need to make more otherwise like why do it. I make consistently 20/hr just driving around fast food orders lol. why work at the actual place and suffer for less money",

    "postText": "It's now summer and above 20c in Sweden every day.   \nI've never been one to spend time in the sun. Compared to the rest of my family. I've always been getting questioned for not wanting to lay in the sun, going for a walk or generally \"enjoy the sun while it's here\". Everytime we are on vacation in a hot country I've always enjoyed sitting under a parasol with a sketchbook, my tablet or just listening to music. Again, compared to my family who tries their best getting a tan.   \n\n\nI am now at my parents for the summer, it's really hot outside, amazing weather. I am sitting inside by my computer with my window opened widely, letting in cool breezes and natural sunlight.  \nMy brother is hear, using our parents porch to sunbathe. And as usual he questions why I am not outside.  \n\n\nMy family are great at making me feel weird about who I am. Making me doubt myself for behaving the way I do. This goes for my whole family, not just parents and siblings.   \nI enjoy summer days the most when I am inside, letting the natueal sunlight and light breezes hit me.  \nBut for real, am I that odd? Should be wanting to be outside more? Cause I am starting to feel shit about myself... ",

    "postText": "Hey, so I (21M, UK) am in a predicament!  \nFor context, I have a full time job in which I make about $50,000/\u00a340,000 annually. I'm an apprentice and work in the construction industry, (I work most Saturdays and sometimes Sunday too, hence why the income is high for my experience). I'm completing two apprenticeships, so in 2 years I'll be a qualified electrician and building engineer. I take care of my physical health (gym 6X per week and sometimes Muay Thai), I invest my money, meditate, utilise cold exposure, read books, spend a lot of time learning about personal development and property/business/finance (I still have good friends and spend time socialising too). I'm a bit like a living self-development meme loooool.  \nI know it's trendy to say this, however I mean it when I say I don't want to settle for an average life, I want to live a fulfilling life, I want to be the best version of myself I can be. I have a burning desire to be successful, to be in the best shape, to retire my parents, create financial freedom for myself and the people I love, be a great parent and husband in the future. I take massive inspiration from the likes of Andrew Huberman, Jordan Peterson &amp; Chris Williamson.\n\n  \nI'm no where near perfect and do make mistakes/have bad habits but I suppose I'm doing the right things? Despite this, I have this constant feeling that I NEED to do more, the biggest frustration is not knowing how best to utilise my time in order to better myself at the highest ROI.  \nHave you got any advice for someone like me? I lack life experience I suppose so it would be great to have someone who is more wise than myself help me out! I love life and I just want to make it the best it can be!  \nAlso for context I got my heart broken 8 months ago, so this has fuelled me massively lol",

            "comment": "Is there anything you are interested in where you could volunteer like a few hours a month (or more)?  You sound really well-rounded in what you do but also have a big heart to give.\n\nJust thinking of where you are in UK has programs for underserved kids who need a big brother type thing, or asst sports coach, or anything that suits you.  Volunteering is not only incredibly satisfying but it usually funded by donors who are great connections to make.\n\nIf not with kids, do you guys have habitat for humanity or other non-profits where they need skilled labor to build housing for lower income families? Or if you like hiking, maybe trail clean-up?",

    "postText": "Like I swear she liked me I asked if she wanted my number she smiled n blushed and said yeah texted me right there to confirm or something on Sunday I waited a day to not seem to eager but I hit her up at 5 and just no response. I get it might not even be rejection yet but idk it\u2019s driving me crazy. I get I just need to get on dating apps but I don\u2019t trust it I like seeing energy, aura their vibe whatever you wanna call it I think it\u2019s an in person thing but damn and fuck if I\u2019m going crazy waiting for one text if I have multiple people I\u2019m waiting on the stress might literally blow me up. I know I\u2019m painfully insecure and I need to work on that but that\u2019s hard when you\u2019ve been single for a while and it\u2019s hard to get a relationship because I\u2019m insecure if anyones ever been in this cycle how\u2019d you get out?",

If a person rejects you, ghosts you, wastes your time, etc.then they are clearly not the one for you.\n\nIt always better to be with someone who wants to be with you rather than someone who you want to be with. They'll treat you much better.",

But also mid typing that I got a sigh of relief because I know it\u2019s dumb but if I don\u2019t talk about it I won\u2019t acknowledge that I\u2019m just being stupid. Thanks again",

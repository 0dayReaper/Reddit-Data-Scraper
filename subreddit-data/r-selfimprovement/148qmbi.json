            "comment": "Hmm something that helped me was to learn the difference between instrumental values and terminal values. Terminal values are like the big picture life goals you have for yourself. And instrumental values are the tools you use to achieve your big picture goals. Each goal that leads you to your big picture goals can be broken down into steps or micro goals. Goals aren't linear and often we don't have enough information to even realize what we are missing. We have to go out there and have experiences that give us clues as to what we want and don't want. In my experience it takes a lot more patience and time to accumulate information and achieve goals than I thought it would. And sometimes we are ready to go for big goals just because we decide we are ready, and all the micro steps either aren't necessary, or have already been achieved, but we didn't realize we achieved it because it didn't look like what we expected it would.",

Humans aren't great at knowing what we want, what we want changes, and the media also tries very hard to steer us towards wanting things that aren't fulfilling.\n\nThe good news is you can try again. You learned things, probably met new people and grew while you were chasing the previous thing. That wasn't time wasted. Now you know what you don't want. Take some time to reflect on what means the most to you, what makes you happy, what you want to avoid and what needs the world has that you could satisfy. You can try as many times as you want, many people don't get this \"figured out\" until their 50's or later and that's okay. We just have to try again and show compassion for ourselves. Life is hard, but you only lose if you give up. I'm on attempt #7 or #8 and I'm not there yet, but I'm a lot closer than I used to be (just like you!). Wishing you all the best!",

    "postText": "When i first met her she made me the happiest i've ever been in my entire life. We traveled and went places we had always talked about and I thought this was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I should've noticed the red flags in the beginning instead of enabling the behavior that would later lead to constant verbal and physical abuse. After every outburst i always blamed myself and promised to make it better. I supported us when she quit her job for 2 months to attend therapy full time and took full financial responsibility yet nothing ever changed. Following every outburst my personal belongings were destroyed or thrown away and she threatened self harm if i left. It got to a point where i was mentally exhausted and she started hanging out with a new guy all hours of night. He took her out to dinner and took her places i wasn't allowed to know nor meet him. After almost a week of silence and no communication i decided to break up with her because it doesn't feel like the same person i fell in love with and proposed to. As i'm typing this I can't help but only think of the good times and miss her more then anything but know i shouldn't go back. I've never felt so alone and lost and not sure what my future holds. How do i move forward from someone i've lived the last three years of my life with every day. I loved her until the end and it's the worst feeling in the world.",

You deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, not manipulation and violence. It sounds like you did the right thing by breaking up with her, even though it hurts so much right now. I know you miss the good times, but you can\u2019t ignore the bad ones. They were real, and they were harmful to you.\r  \n\r  \nI can relate to your situation, because I also went through a bad breakup with someone I loved very much, but who was toxic for me. It was hard to let go, but I realized that I had to take care of myself first. I tried to use the experience as a way to learn more about myself, what I want and need in a relationship, and what kind of person I want to be with. I also tried to focus on the positive aspects of my life, like my friends, hobbies, goals, etc. It took time, but I eventually healed and moved on.\r  \n\r  \nMaybe one day, you and your ex will be in a better place and reconnect, who knows. But for now, the most important thing is to focus on yourself and your well-being. You are not alone, and you are not lost. You have a future ahead of you, full of possibilities and opportunities. You are strong, resilient, and worthy of love. Don\u2019t let this relationship define you or hold you back. You can move forward from this, and you will find happiness again. Take it one day at a time. I\u2019m rooting for you!",

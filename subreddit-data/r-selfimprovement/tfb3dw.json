I mean your very young, you have a lot to live and experience.\n\nThe average life expectancy is 80 and can go up depending on the persons life style, country, gender etc. So for someone in their 30s and 20s you have a lot of time on your hand. Go out enjoy your youth, stop being so fixated on what you could have achieved a few years ago. Go and achieve it now. Your young enjoy  live life\n\nEdit: Thank you for the likes and the awards everyone \ud83d\ude4f",

I\u2019m terrified about going to university, I never graduated high school and am finishing upgrading now but I\u2019ve been out of the game for 20 years. I have doubts if I\u2019m making the right choice, part of the reason I never pursued school is cause it\u2019s expensive and I didn\u2019t want to waste my time but I love horticulture and the excitement outweighs the fear. I think us humans are complex creatures that aren\u2019t defined by a singular feature. Your job, hobbies, sexual orientation are only a small part of who you are, not the whole picture. At this point the worse thing that can happen is maybe you don\u2019t pass. Doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t try again or reconsider your path but you\u2019ll still learn something from it. Your peers probably feel the same pressure but are maybe good at hiding it. Honestly I can\u2019t recommend talking to a counsellor enough, it did wonders for me at sorting out my anxiety and issues. I hope things get better for you, just keep moving forward even if it\u2019s tiny steps.",

Hate that feeling I sometimes have that I\u2019ve completely wasted my youth and what could\u2019ve been my most productive years. They were taken from me from my depression and anxiety, and that sucks. I feel like men in my position have a bit of an advantage, because they don\u2019t really have a clock ticking. For me, I\u2019m slowly coming to the realization that it\u2019ll probably be too late to have kids when it\u2019s all said and done (also have to go to school and/or get a career established, and even then I feel like I\u2019d ideally prefer to have a kid with a partner). But that\u2019s okay. Better to focus on what we can change, rather than what we can\u2019t. If I still want kids and it winds up being too late to have them naturally with limited risk, by the time I\u2019m ready, then there will always be the option of adoption/fostering. If you still want kids, you could have the privilege of giving an already existing child a loving home instead of having your own. Nothing wrong with that.",

By 45, fertility has declined so much that getting pregnant naturally is unlikely for most women. By age 40, the chance of getting pregnant in any monthly cycle is around 5%. And the risks of pregnancy complications increase as women age. And not to mention mens testosterone decreasing greatly these days, almost down 50% compared to their grandfathers, which also makes conceiving harder. And many many other reasons, but you get the point.\n\nTLDR: you shouldn't wait. There are many couples out there that struggle to conceive because they waited for too long.",

I feel like I only have 5-6 years to do all these things among others. I know it's probably not a right way to go about it. I'll be working on that. But still it's easy to give advice or suggestions on social media, way harder to actually tackle societal expectations, expectations from parents and family. You'd have to do the hard job of choosing. So yes we know 30s is young. But we're not taught that, and what we were told since childhood - we've internalized",

However, I need to ask about this.  \n\n\nGenerally I would be optimistic for future, as barely any goals have a hard time limit, except for one reason : climate change and the pressures coming with it. I am a middle income person in a third world country, and quite unlikely to reach the high wealth to be safe from it. It worries me that I might have to migrate and leave when the crops fail, or the heatwaves are unbearable (40-45 C is common for years now, and expected to rise), and that kills my hope. I want to know how can I be hopeful.  \n\n\nApologies if this seems like a stingy comment, I am just troubled by this very often.",

It's the whole circle of influence thing \u2014 you don't have any control over climate change. You **do** have control over what you spend your time thinking and worrying about. And you **do** have control over your own actions.\n\nWhether or not you pursue your dreams, climate change will happen. That's a fact.\n\nNone of us can predict how climate change will happen exactly, and what the impacts will be. That's also a fact. Who knows what technological breakthroughs will make it easier to deal with. Who knows what opportunities you as a person will get to escape the effects of climate change (maybe a career opportunity in a colder country). None of us know, and none of us can do anything about it.\n\nSo why worry? Why let it stop you? It's time wasted.\n\nI know you probably think \"easy for you to say - you're in a cooler climate, and in a better financial position to cope with climate change\". And you're right. I don't know what it's like to be you. But I know that we're both human, and we both worry about things that are happening at a global/geopolitical scale that we have no control over. So I understand how you feel.\n\nThe book 'The Subtle Art of not Giving a Fuck' by Mark Manson helped me enormously in this area.",

I'm afraid to follow it, cause it might be worse for my general health. People before and with me didn't cared about threats like climate change, or more recent ones like covid or the war in Ukraine, and suffered directly because of it. \n\nI know 'not giving a fuck' is good for my mental health, I'm just unsure whether that'll make me too ignorant to notice an upcoming threat.\n\nThanks for the kind words.",

Anyway, he made the comment that he was sure there were other things I would rather be doing. I replied that I usually play piano on Tuesday night after work, and that I'd rather be doing that. He lamented that he always wanted to learn how to play the piano. I told him it's never too late to learn. You can achieve your goals at any age! (Keep in mind, I'm 42, so he's in his late 50's).

One of them being that I'm just tired and less able to dedicate time to certain things after 30.\n4) biological clock is a real thing if children are a part of your goals.

Ik I shouldn\u2019t compare myself to others but it gets really easy to do so when going about your day and you feel so behind in life it sucks.\n\nAnyone reading this right now just start working towards something you care about and don\u2019t give af about others opinions of what you should do or shouldn\u2019t do. They\u2019re not responsible for you happiness, only you are.\n\nThank you for my mini Ted takk",

    "postText": "I'm 20f, so I'm already an adult, but what I'm scared of comes after being in college. I'm afraid of being an independent adult who has a job. I'm afraid of having no freetime with a job, I'm afraid of all my friends becoming too busy to hang out/play games. all i can think about is when the last time i'll hang out with my friends will be. i dont want to be perceived as not being young anymore, that scares me and i dont know how to cope with the fact i'm getting older. I already miss so much from the past, things from just a year ago, and the way time moves so quick scares me. I can't imagine myself being 23+, the thought of that physically makes me sick, and the thought of me being in my 30s scares me. Yes, 30 is still young generally speaking, but I'm afraid of being an \"actual\" adult with a job and my own responsibilities.",

I quit school and started working when I was 16 and slowly I saw my friends going to different schools/studies and jobs. Lost a few friends but gained many more.\n\nLife doesn't stop here believe me it's just starting. There are going to be moment where you'll hate everyone and everything, but there'll be plenty of love and laughs to go around!",

You'll have tons of free time!\n\nThen you can decide if you like being cold, hungry and unsafe.\n\nWhen that becomes the alternative, you'll be so excited to earn a paycheck and do laundry.\n\nHell, even the 110-120 hours a week you're not working a full-time job will even seem like a perfectly reasonable amount of free time!",

I am still perceived as a young adult because that's what I am. Still so much to learn but growing up means learning new skills which include time management. You find a way.",

    "postText": "The sunk cost fallacy is a cognitive bias that leads individuals to make irrational decisions based on past investments, even when those investments are no longer recoverable or relevant to the current situation.\n\n  \nTo put that into perspective it\u2019s like someone going to university for a four-year course, going for one year and hating it. Hating every day, feeling like you have no future potential with that course yet your reason for continuing is that you don\u2019t want your last year to be a waste.\n\n  \nOr like being in a 5-year relationship and you\u2019re miserable, you argue yet your reason for not ending what should be ended is that you\u2019ve been together for 5 years.\n\n  \nThere are several reasons why people fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy. Firstly, people often tend to have a strong aversion to loss. They feel that if they abandon a project or decision, they will lose not only the resources already invested but also the potential gains they anticipated. This fear of loss can cloud judgment and lead to continued investment in future endeavours.\n\n  \nTo overcome the sunk cost fallacy you can do a few things:  \n1. Recognize sunk costs: Understand that past investments are irrelevant to future decision-making. Separate the emotional attachment to sunk costs from the current situation.  \n2. Evaluate alternatives objectively: Consider the current circumstances, prospects, and potential outcomes without being influenced by sunk costs. Analyze the situation as if no prior investment had been made.  \n3. Seek external perspectives: seek someone who can provide an unbiased viewpoint.\n\n**PS.

            "comment": "I think the idea of sunk costs, or thinking about how much you've invested into something, can also be helpful because in the midst of extremely challenging circumstances and emotion, it helps you remember that you have benefited from and cared about whatever the thing is, or at least some key component of it, and this sense of heartbreak or attachment may help motivate you to look for different solutions to whatever problem is being faced, or to not throw the baby out with the bath water and figure out what purpose this thing has been serving in your life, and the pros and cons. Sometimes the solution can only be found once you have labeled it as a sunk cost fallacy so that you can give yourself a mental break or spatial distance and have time to cool off and consider things",

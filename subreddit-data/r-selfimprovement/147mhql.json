Things like finding freedom in realising how insignificant you are, that others don't think of you that much, etc.\n\nHow do you concretely work towards a mindset that makes you care less about what others think? Do you need to consistently speak your thoughts? Is it good to actively try to do weird stuff to show yourself it doesn't matter? Is there a mindset or thought that you need to repeat?",

I'm sure after 1000 rejections something changes with the caring part of our brain\n\nFor my part, copious amounts of making a fool of myself falling while trying to learn balance stuff outdoors helped a lot. Copious amounts of smoking weed and existing in public has also raised the treshold for what I find uncomfortable\n\nOther than that idk. Psychedelics maybe. Why exactly do you care about others, or with regards to what parts of yourself?",

That usually boils down to hygiene and clean, fitting clothes.\n\nOtherwise, I just let people filter themselves out.\n\nI made a minor mistake and you're making a big deal out of it? Not worth my time.\n\nDon't like my hobbies? Not worth my time.\n\nClearly don't want me around for whatever reason? Bye Felecia!\n\nThere are FAR more people out there than I can possibly keep up with, so I just don't care. And honestly, I think most successful people have the same attitude.",

Even if it might be illogical and incorrect it\u2019s still their right. \nYou can\u2019t control that, what you can control is the action of being the opposite of what they think of you. And you start to care less as their thoughts are incorrect.\n\nAnother aspect is a lot of what we think others think of us are assumptions. Until you ask that person or they made it clear then don\u2019t think about it too much.\n\nThe abstract ideas you mentioned are actually powerful, you just have to apply it to your situation and go deep into thought.",

    "postText": "Right now, I'm 23 years old and I'm starting to get a sense of what I want out of life. To be honest, I'm leaning towards living a traditional life. My long term goals include:\n\n* Making $200k+ in my 30s(currently making $75k as a Business Analyst out of   \ncollege; aiming for $100k for my next job). I'm also ok with entrepreneurship if the opportunity ever presents itself.\n* Being healthy. I've gotten into the habit of regularly going to the Dr. for   \nphysicals, dental cleanings, eye exams, and just keeping on track of my health. I've also been eating more cleanly and exercising at least 3-5x/week so I can be active. I'm a little bit overweight so it wouldn't hurt for me to lose some weight.\n* Owning a house(NYC is too expensive to own a house so I might move either to the south or states south of NY)\n* Solid friend group that will be there as I get older\n* Getting married &amp; having kids.\n* Retire with a healthy 401k amount/savings/investments so I never have to work again\n\nHowever, a lot of people my age tell me that the traditional life is dead and that I should just be single and have friends, grind out a career/be an entrepreneur, live at the gym, and just survive with my   \nhobbies. I understand everyone follows their own path, but to me that seems like I'll still be missing things.\n\nAre my goals unrealistic now or should I set some better goals for myself?",

            "comment": "I think that the first thing that you should accept is that no matter what path you\u2019ll take, you\u2019ll end up missing out on things that are only possible if you took another path. If you have kids, you will have a very different life than someone who doesn\u2019t. If you prioritize saving money you will have a vastly different retirement than someone who didn\u2019t. If you live in the countryside you will have a very different experience than if you live in the city etc.\n\nUltimately you have to decide what is right for you, and what you are comfortable missing out on in order to make that dream a reality. It sounds like you are pretty sure that the \u201ctraditional\u201d life is what you want, so that\u2019s what you should be taking steps to make happen. There is a lot of pressure in social media to be a grinding hustler entrepreneur but that sort of lifestyle is not for everyone, nor will it lead to satisfaction if it is getting in the way of what you actually want out of life. I know it\u2019s corny and cliche but just follow your heart and live the life you actually want, not the one that influencers are trying to sell you.",

    "postText": "I'm 30 year old male. I've been feeling very down. I think my biggest fear is to be looked down on by other people. \n\nI get anxious and stressed out so much when I think \n\n1) I may sound weird to other people when I talk (I developed some complications after a dental surgery)\n\n2) I may look unattractive because I can't work out the same way as before because of my injured knee and also I started losing hair\n\n3) People may think I'm a failure if I can't make a certain amount of money or have a respectable job\n\n4) People may think I'm pathetic if I end up being alone without a beautiful partner when I'm over 40.\n\nOn the other hand I'm pretty good looking, date girls, like my job, and make okay money for now. i guess there are many things to be grateful for if I look at the right place. But I just can't stop worrying that things will eventually become worse and I start hating my life more.\n\nI'd appreciate some words of wisdom.",

            "comment": "A few quotes I enjoy from former football coach Vince Lombardi are:\n\n1. \u201cPerfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence.\u201d\n2. \"Winning is a habit. Watch your thoughts, they become your beliefs. Watch your beliefs, they become your words. Watch your words, they become your actions. Watch your actions, they become your habits. Watch your habits, they become your character.\u201d\n3.  \u201cObstacles are what you see when you take your eyes off of the goal.\u201d\n\nSo in my mind, while none of us will ever be perfect, if we stay focused on being and doing our best always, we will be better than we otherwise would have been.  I encourage you to not be concerned about what others may think and just be the best you can.  My knowing that  I am doing my best gives me a sense of self-worth and confidence.  Praying that you find a way that is best for you to do the same.",

            "comment": "I was largely in the same boat - doing OK but dissatisfied on the inside.\n\nMy strategy became to outwork everyone around me, with the idea that I'd eventually create recognizable value.\n\nIn the end, I DID create a lot of value in myself and that boosted my confidence. \n\nAnd if you're projecting confidence, people generally accept that you're confident.\n\nWhen you *know* you can kick biblical amounts of ass on demand, you don't worry about others looking down on you. You actually end up with challengers (which are awesome, cause they push you further) and haters (who are summarily ignored).\n\nI got hard about building the life I wanted in my early 30's. I'm 39 now and life is drastically different - especially in past 3-4 years.\n\nMy advice: pick a skill you feel would help you and become competent. Then pick another skill and using the previous skill you learned, become competent in that.\n\nMy list looks like this:\n\nLearning - I did what the top minds in the world say is the best way to learn.\n\nPractice - learned from top minds, have applied principles for thousands of hours now.\n\nProblem-solving - the book Bulletproof Problem Solving\n\nLearning from failure - the book Black Box Thinking \n\nMindset - Grit and Mindset by Carol Dweck\n\nEmotional Intelligence - book by Daniel Goleman\n\nThe Male Psyche -  the book King Warrior Magician Lover \n\nMath - The Art of Problem Solving - good for thinking strategies and helped me become an Excel wizard.\n\nI'm studying two things rn: mindset (with a focus on high-achieving men) and social intelligence \n\nYou can waste a looooot of time spinning your tires and feeling like you're getting somewhere. \n\nIf you minimize your focus and spend 1 hour a day building a valuable skill and then using that skill to learn the next one, success becomes inevitable.",

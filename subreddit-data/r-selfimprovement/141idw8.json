    "postText": "Ever since I was a child I began to be reserved and insecure. I loved the idea of having friends and internally was very social. Butts, because of fear of rejection and judgments I wasn't as outgoing as I could have been. \n\nThis type of lifestyle lasted between the ages of 7 and 22. But now I'm 23 and I've decided to unconsciously change that and try and become more social. Now whenever I go to social gatherings and parties, I just forge this sudden urge/courage to ask people that I'm relatively friendly with to take selfies and pictures\n\nNow the thing about this was I wasn't necessarily very close friends with some of these people but I got decent vibes from them and just went for it. I usually don't do things like this unless you and I are very close and even if me and the people were close, I wasn't really one to take much pictures, but this past year and a half I have decided to start taking a lot more pictures of myself and with others\n\nI did the same thing at a wedding last weekend. My mom noticed that I was asking different people that I knew and was friendly with for pictures/ selfies together. Some of the people I was a bit closer to than others but most of them I was very familiar with and had a friendly relationship with. I would never go to people that I don't really talk to or like to ask for selfies and pictures. \n\nMy mom told me that I shouldn't be going to so many people  asking for selfies and pictures because it makes me look desperate and that I should wait for them to come to me. I personally just wanted to market myself as more friendly and approachable because I feel like most of my life I've always come off as standoffish and reserved. I definitely understand where my mom is coming from and I've always had the mindset to not be way too desperate because I've had some people give me weird vibes when I try to be social with them. I even texted one of them that was at the wedding to meet me so we can take pictures but never got a response\n\nHow do I know whether to be friendly with people or not. When is it too much? I don't want rejection because I feel like if I keep doing this that fear might come back but at the same time I want to come off is very friendly and outgoing... Naturally of course and knots forcing it.",

After losing loved ones and falling out of touch with people, you'll find yourself thanking your past self for getting a picture with that person you lost or don't talk to much anymore. My mom was put on a ventilator in her final days, and one thing I regret more than anything was not getting a recording of her telling her grandbabies how much she loved them. I now send voice messages to everyone I care for just in case anything ever happens to me, they'll be able to hear my voice if they miss me! Not desperate at all, embrace the nerves and reject condescending judgment. If it means a lot to you then its worth it!",

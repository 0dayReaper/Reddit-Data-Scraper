    "postText": "Like even if I (24m) workout, my mom is just going to keep buying junk food that I like and that's easy to microwave and eat so I'm not gonna lose weight. I can learn how to cook but that means spending a whole bunch of money buying ingredients and tools that I don't feel compelled to buy and also time being spent learning cooking will be a lot so again I'd probably just default to warming up the junk and eating... \n\nAnd that's not even all. I don't have a completed drivers license or a job currently. Using public transport is already time consuming and annoying (cuz busses be late too often) and the lack of job makes me less likely to spend money on stuff until I start working again (because I'm running out after paying for a summer college course this summer out of pocket and buying a car last month).\n\nAny advice anyone can give for how to navigate this situation cuz I can literally feel my belly fat now and play with it and I hate it but idk what to do my mind just feels trapped in an endless loop",

If you want to make a lifestyle change and become more fit, tell yourself that, then do it.\n\nDon\u2019t sabotage yourself by starting out with, ugh, I have to workout!! Or ugh, I have to eat the junk food mom bought again!! Instead say this; I am choosing to workout!! And I am choosing this healthy meal over any junk.\n\nThe next thing you do, go for daily walks - instead of saying ugh, I have to walk 5 miles today; say this instead, let me just do a 2 mile walk. Your mind will think it won, since 2 miles is easier than 5. But when you get to that two mile mark, your body takes over and says I easily have  another 2-3 miles in me!! Boom, you just defeated your mind.\n\nJust remember, your mind is there to keep you from doing things that are uncomfortable, that is one of its primary jobs.\n\nNow get off of Reddit and make a choice to go for a walk.",

Context to why I feel \"trapped\" and no its not just my mental health issues. All I'll say is it has to do with family problems combined with my unfortunate mental state making me only want to pursue comfort over anything else for years. It's most definitely my fault for choosing comfort but also the fault of some things in my life that are out of my control.\n\nDriving is something I'm trying to learn among other things (like having an interest in cooking). Literally practiced today. It's why I bought the car. Something of my own that I can practice with. You might not see it this way but I see it as a part of me coming into my own person. Yes its happening at 24 and I already feel like shit about it. Thanks for making it worse lol.\n\nMy priority is self-improvement and developing myself. Working out and eating healthy is a part of that. I'm doing summer research work on campus this month. That's another part of it.",

This does not have to be all or nothing like you\u2019re making it. \n\nStop thinking of working out as a weight loss method, for starters. Start strength training and some gentle cardio because they will greatly improve your quality of life, even if the scale doesn\u2019t go down one single pound. \n\nStart super small. Start with 10 minutes 2-3x/week, and build on that when you\u2019re ready.\n\nOnce you\u2019re ready to tackle the food, pay attention to your hunger cues. If you change not a single thing about WHAT you eat, but stop over-eating, eating when you\u2019re not hungry, boredom/stress/comfort/emotional eating, that goes a long way. \n\nWhen you\u2019re in a position to address the content of what you eat you can always shift that gradually too.",

I can't cook at all, I buy pre-seasoned salmon and toss it into the air fryer. I also buy frozen vegetables which yes, they are fine for weight loss. Depending on what my mom buys or cooks, I just eat less of it or I just choose not to depending what it is. You also should let your mom know that you want to change your diet, tell her to not buy any of those junkfoods anymore, especially if she's specifically buying it for you. Go shopping with her if you need to. \n\nFor exercise, the comment with the daily walks is a good start, 30 minutes of brisk walking everyday is a good way to start. It's what I exactly did, I eventually would sometimes push to 40 minutes or an hour. If you keep at it, you can gradually go for longer, you might even be able to start jogging for a minute or more - currently I do mostly walking and some jogging intervals. Also, walking inclines is good too, definitely try to aim for some incline if you are walking around your neighbourhood. \n\nOn YouTube, there's some HIIT workouts but that might be hard to do at first since after all, HIIT stands for High-intensity interval training but don't do a certain exercise that you won't enjoy. I didn't enjoy it when I tried it, it was a bit intense for me, so I am just sticking to my normal walking + jogging along with weight training exercises.",

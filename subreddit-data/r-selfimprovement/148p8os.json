    "postText": "Hi,\n\nSo basically I want to reach high success in any area of my life. My grades in School are already great, but I want to have full points everywhere and become the best student.\n\nAt the same time, I want to become an excellent pianist, but I also want to go to the Gym and build muscles.\n\nMy problem is, I feel like I could get more of my time during the day, although I have school until 4PM everyday and Gym takes around 2h extra. When I have exams I also have to study a lot.\n\nSo are there any tips or \u201ctricks\u201c to just have more time (or to improve time management)?\n\n\nOr are my expectations not realistic?",

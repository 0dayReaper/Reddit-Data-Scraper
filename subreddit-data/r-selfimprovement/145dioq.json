    "postText": "(Ironic that I'm writing this on a social media platform lmao.)\n\nYou've probably heard this everywhere, that social media is bad for you and all. While yes, it's a great tool for creators and businesses, but for the average person, chances are it's not doing anything to improve your health. \n\nNowadays, most people consume so much media that they're brains are now addicted to social media. Most people I know can't sit still for 10 minutes without pulling out their phones. It's now so easy to get rid of your boredom by simply whipping out your phone and scrolling mindlessly through TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, etc.\n\nIt's especially short form content. Like TikTok, Insta reels, YT Shorts, etc, these are the absolute worst attention killers. 99.9% of the content you consume there does not contribute to anything worthwhile. You will forget almost all of the media you consume from those platforms. I've talked about this before, but this kind of content is one of the worst ways to use social media.\n\nRecently, I've been trying to cut down on my social media usage by a lot. I used to be the type that would scroll mindlessly for literal hours on Instagram reels, consuming worthless content and wasting so much time. Not only did this cause me to procrastinate on my schoolwork, it made my attention span absolutely garbage, and I became extremely impatient. I couldn't even wait like 10 minutes for anything without my phone. \n\nCompare that to me now. I use my phone for less than 15 minutes every day, and most of that time isn't even used on social media, it's mostly for the essential pre-installed apps, like the notes app, or the clock app, etc. I use my computer to check my socials instead, and I immediately close the tab the moment I finish doing exactly what I need to do. I haven't touched short video content in weeks or months even. \n\nAnd guess what? Everything is better now. While yes, there are many other factors that could contribute to this, I think one of the main factors that was taking away from my time was social media. Now, I don't even feel bored anymore. I'm able to sit in a room in silence, doing absolutely nothing, and I would be completely fine for like 15 minutes (after that I'd just end up falling asleep lmao). I have no urges to take out my phone or check the internet. I'm able to study for longer periods of time and be more focused during these periods. I'm able to have a good sleep schedule now. In general, I'm a lot more self-disciplined and my head feels so much clearer.\n\nI'm not saying you should quit social media entirely. There's a lot of good content out there. YouTube has many helpful videos. This subreddit has good tips. Talking with friends that live far away is nice. But nowadays so many people are dependent and addicted to social media. When used correctly and in moderation, it's a powerful tool that connects people. When used irresponsibly, it only leads to worse mental health.\n\n(I'm aware I'm not the most qualified to give advice for this. I'm speaking entirely from my own experiences. Other people's experiences will differ. But I think most people who have drastically reduced social media or cut it out entirely would agree with me. For example, I know one of my friends who has done this has felt significant improvements, and so have I.)",

Next time you\u2019re at a restaurant, look around and you\u2019ll see the issue. Families on their phones. Babies with iPads like they\u2019re pacifiers. \n\nGood on you for spreading your success story - we need more of them. You\u2019ve inspired me to cut down even more.",

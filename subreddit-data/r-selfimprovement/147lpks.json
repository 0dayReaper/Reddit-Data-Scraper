I've built up a proper daily routine that I'm sticking to, going to NA meetings everyday, watching what I eat/eating at the same times every day and I've cut down on drinking fizzy drinks, I was drinking 2L of pepsi per day now I'm down to one 330ml can. Quitting smoking messed with my head big time but I think I'm through the worst of it now I feel somewhat normal again with minimal cravings.",

I\u2019ve been to jail, so many times, caught like 8 violations of a court order to abstain from drugs and alcohol in the last year. Went to rehab, had everuthing dismissed, came home and drank, bought $800 worth of adderall, Xanax and booze and was\nBack in jail 4 days later\u2026.. then my fianc\u00e9 dumped me because I guess while I was blacked out I kicked her out at 3am\u2026\u2026 that\u2019s about when it all clicked. I\u2019ve got a bit over 2 weeks without alcohol and while im doing some shit most people think is way worse, I can tell you alcohol is the only thing that\u2019s been so hard to quit, left me clinically dead for 20min, caused 6 seizurses from withdrawals and ruined my relationship with the girl I was so sure I\u2019d marry.

By the 4th and 5th day is when I feel the real battle comes. I don't wish addiction on anybody. Maybe my enemies yes lol. It's a horrible thing to go through. Keep it up man your awesome.",

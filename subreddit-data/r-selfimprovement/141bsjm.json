It's best to prioritize sleep first. \n\nCurrently mine looks like: \n\n5 am wake up\n\n6 gym \n\n7ish breakfast\n\nThen shower, shave, get dressed \n\nYou can always substitute gym time for meditation or reading or Journaling but it's really gonna depend on what time frame you are looking at..",

It has some default routines that are worth trying but you can always create your own and personalized one.\n\nI use it every day and have managed to follow a daily routine including yoga, journaling and a healthy breakfast.",

    "postText": "I know the title sounds harsh but I promise I mean it for good.\n\nI think social media has warped a lot of people's perceptions about how important we all are. It has boosted our egos in negative ways where we think the world is watching us. In the process, we have become slaves to people's thoughts and perceptions. \n\nIf that is something you struggle with, I encourage you to try this experiment - Get off social media for 1 month and don't announce that you are doing so. Just quietly log off or don't post anything. And don't check anything while you do so.\n\nThis might be uncomfortable at first as we are so wired to our phones. And it will only get worse. I bet a large number of you will find that very few, if any at all, will actually notice that you've been inactive. This has happened to me and to a large number of people and has served as a humbling experience.\n\n**Why do I suggest you try this? Well, if you are a slave to what people think, this can be a very liberating exercise in realizing that LITERALLY NO ONE CARES OR IS THINKING OF YOU. So what you post and what you do should not be dependent so much on others think. Just do you.**\n\nIf you are willing to embrace the discomfort, I think you will come out of it more humbled with a healthier self-perception and self-esteem in the process.",

I realize now though, that no one really was. We have much less of a significant impact on others in the social media realm than we think. It's ridiculous to think of the pressure people place on themselves to maintain an illusion.",

When you get rid of that you can focus on yourself and your close circle.\n\nMental clarity - there's only so much info the human brain can take on, and if you get rid of socials then you free up some mental capacity\n\nBetter sleep - no more checking socials before bed or first thing in the morning, so I slept better (as I wasn't staring at screens) and was more productive in the mornings",

Instead of just sitting in a chair staring at my phone I\u2019m going hiking, because I have the time all of a sudden. \n\nI\u2019m a lot more energized, because keeping up a social image and constantly tracking what\u2019s going on in other peoples lives is exhausting and stressful. \n\nI\u2019m less spacey, since I\u2019m not just sitting there scrolling I have to be engaged in the physical world around me instead of just mindlessly daydreaming or spacing out. \n\nI\u2019m much more positive than I used to be. Seeing the news (mostly negative) plastered everywhere really drained my mental health to the point where I was grumpy and bitter all the time. Not having that constantly shoved in the front of my mind from seeing people discuss it really helped. \n\nIn general I\u2019d say that getting rid of most of my online presence really allowed me to focus on the \u201chere and now\u201d of my life, instead of constantly wasting my time learning about other peoples lives and things going on in the world that don\u2019t affect me. I\u2019m just some dude living in a small town trying to make a living, and that\u2019s all I really need to worry about.\n\nEdit: There\u2019s tons of studies and articles about the benefits of being \u201cproactive\u201d instead of \u201creactive\u201d (being on social media is a reactive activity) and I\u2019m trying to be more of the former and less of the latter. \n\nSo lowering my consumption is definitely my number one priority. Not just with social media, but food/drink (less plastics used like bottles and containers), and entertainment (less time watching tv or YouTube or Netflix).",

It's powerful to overcome the urge to share, fix, opine, etc.\n\nThe irony is that this (my) post is pretty much a complete waste of time and headspace for me. I mean, right? Did my comment above add any value to your life? And even if it did make some fractional impact, should I really be prioritizing this response to the thing I'm doing right now with my life?\n\nGonna go make bacon so my wife can wake up to that smell.

I had built up a following of 30k followers over the years, deactivated my Instagram 6 months ago with no warning and literally not a single person has said anything about it. Not one, out of 30,000 followers lol. \n\nThe time I would be spending on Instagram I have been able to use more productively, and I am no longer sharing things for other people. Instead, I am enjoying my life for me. I don\u2019t have any anxieties about people I don\u2019t even know knowing everything about my day/life, and the small circle I do have has became stronger and more meaningful. I really do feel free, and blessed",

If you find yourself attaching your worth too much to their perceptions, it may be a good sign it might be time to do a social media detox like this.\n\nAt the end of the day, you come to realize that maybe a few will care about us but the vast majority of people don\u2019t.

It\u2019s a nice mental break that\u2019s turning into a major distraction. That said, I used to go weeks without checking Reddit as well. I keep one device not logged in, to catch some headlines.

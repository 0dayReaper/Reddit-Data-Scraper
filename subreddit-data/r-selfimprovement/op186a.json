But we know we\u2019re lying to ourselves. Everyone has time for things, it\u2019s just that we don\u2019t make it a priority. It might be we\u2019re avoiding it because we\u2019re scared of failure. \n\nAt some point we\u2019re going to need to go for it.

I read 3 or 4 other books about getting sober and none of them helped. This Naked Mind helped me reframe my thinking and made me *look forward* to being sober and the life it could bring. It made me see it as something I really wanted, rather than something that I *had* to do and dreaded.\n\nI also recommend the app \"Quit Drinking\" with the purple logo. It tracks your progress and gives you a timeline to several health goals that you will reach based on your quit date. For example, there's a 1 week countdown to when the withdrawal symptoms end, a 3 week countdown to when your neurons regenerate, a 1 month countdown to when your mental health improves, etc. I find this helps motivate me because I want to reach these goals!\n\nAlso, come join us over at r/stopdrinking \\- it's a very supportive community!",

I eventually learned on my own after much unnecessary pain how to manage most of them, but now I feel like a broken individual. \n\n\nWhat I struggle the most with these days is confidence, also one day when I was a kid I asked myself \"what even is the point?\" and never found a satisfactory answer. For this reason I have a deep seated lack of drive and motivation and can seldom begin and stick to new projects. Since I had to learn how to be my own therapist, so to say, I got stuck in a really bad case of paralysis analysis for more than a decade that left me with crippling social anxiety and a fractured self.\n\n\nI don't know why I'm telling all of this, I guess what I wanted to say is that my father would accuse me to just create excuses, but I simply can't pretend I don't have these problems and go on with my life. I know because I tried, more and more times. It always ended up in extreme failure and discomfort. You can't just pretend you don't have disabilities and make them go away.",

All failed to gain traction.\n\nLong story short, each failure gave me the chance to extract wisdom from the negative outcome and now I run a semi sucessfull small business (and have for 2.5 years)\n\nStill working on personal development, following through,  not procrastinating,  and kicking alcoholism and substance abuse.\n\nJust keep learning from each mistake, there is gold to be found in almost any negative outcome.\n\nLast year I burned myself out chasing tendies.  It was the first year of my life I made more then 35k (I actually surpassed 100k barely).\n\nI grew up lower middle class and managed to earn more solo then both my parents.\n\nI still have no tangible assets other then the business though.\n\nAlso sacrifice is key. I needed to either give up my apartment or my business in the first year. I gave up the apartment and moved into my shop. Been living there for 2 years now.\n\nLife is like a juggling act. The ball I drop is different every time. \n\nDidn't come here to humble brag. Just wanted to share my point of view and experience . But it was adversity and tragedy that made me capable of doing what I did. \n\nNow I'm planning on changing careers in a few years, so I'm preparing for that today. But still struggling with personal development.\n\nI started my business with only 3k (for first and last plus basic equipment)",

From my experience even when you are tired of your excuses, you won't be able to fix everything you get tired of, buuut you can improve one thing at a time and start building from there. \n\n\nIt also helps you gain some confidence and motivation to keep exploring yourself and your needs and weak points. It makes you see yourself differently and things start coming together naturally.",

I know that 90% of things in my life are my own fault and my behavior and choices in the past is what caused me to be the man I am today and I\u2019m incredibly miserable. When I realize that things are my fault, I keep on beating myself up and realize that I\u2019m just trash and a lost cause instead of letting that fuel me and work harder. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like I know what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s causing most of these negative thinking but I feel like I\u2019m too powerless to do anything about it and any effort I make to fight them, even giving it my best, it becomes not enough and it feels like I didn\u2019t do a thing.",

Sadly me and my ex experienced a miscarriage last month and we had a fallout about several things in the past which caused us to go our separate ways. So I really needed to hear  this to help me find myself because life is beautiful and I'll be damned if I leave it without enjoying it...",

It was not a consistent path, but eventually I kept trying and now I'm on a completely different trajectory.  I refuse to be angry, disappointed, offended or sad. Life is too precious and short to waste. Here I am now, in control of my mind where everything begins.",

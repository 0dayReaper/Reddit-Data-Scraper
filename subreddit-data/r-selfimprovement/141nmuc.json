    "postText": "I 20f have a lot of things I want to do but I keep putting off because I'm afraid of failing. I want to get into making music, and I make youtube videos, but I'm afraid to start/come up with ideas for my videos because I'm afraid I'd end up nowhere with them. I don't care about having millions of people watching me, and becoming famous, but I still want a decent audience. \n\nI tell myself I'm gonna come up with great videos and stuff like that, but then I think about the work I need to put in and the chance of failing, and I get overwhelmed so I tell myself to worry about it later, and the cycle repeats. I genuinely love making videos and I'm a great editor but I'm still afraid of the failure and I don't know how to overcome it.",

            "comment": "You have to redefine your definition of failure. Something is only a true failure if we fail to learn or enjoy anything in the process. You have to fall so in love with what you are doing that the external response you receive or don't receive for your effort is irrelevant. If your idea of success is dependent on the external, you are binding yourself to something that will never make you feel fulfilled, because it is conditional.\n\nSo I suggest you shift your focus to why you're making videos in the first place. Really immerse yourself in the feeling of love and joy you get from it. Those thoughts that make you doubt yourself and think it's pointless or a waste of time to do what you love aren't useful. If you love what you do, it will always be worth the effort. It's a subtle difference of placing more importance on enjoying the journey rather than some destination. \n\nIf things didn't go the way you thought they would, it is okay. At least you can tell yourself you had the courage to try and you enjoyed yourself in the process. The beautiful thing is you have an endless amount of tries and ways you can experiment. Don't limit yourself. When you love something, you don't give up on it.",

When no one is around practice the routine. My suggestion is don\u2019t let your first vids get too long so you don\u2019t get hung up on the editing.",

            "comment": "Well, I think you are afraid that you will get nowhere with your videos because that is the conclusion that comes after you are thinking that your videos are not good in some way. Maybe you are comparing them to videos that aren't a compatible style for what you want to do, or maybe there are some ways you can fine tune what you're doing so that you are proud of it, or maybe you just need to make your mind a safe place for yourself and say it's ok to be proud or entertained by what you are doing before getting positive feedback from other people. Or maybe it would help you to get positive feedback from people on whatever you're YouTube video is about to help you feel confident that this is something you succeed in.. Or maybe you are getting too caught up in the long-term expectations and intents which you actually have little control over, instead of making sure that you enjoy the process in the moment and in doing so, you use a carrot/ intrinsic reward as motivation, instead of a stick/ fear of failure as a motivation.\n\nIt may help to ask yourself what are you looking for out of a YouTube success, is it primarily financial stability, or an enjoyable creative lifestyle, is it the feeling of support and belonging with people, and what ways can you get these things that aren't YouTube success? Because even though you may very well achieve this, it probably won't be instant and in the meanwhile you still deserve it.",

It was a huge relief when I finally did it and now I'll just keep making it. I belive that in time people who would enjoy your content will find it. Everybody likes something so I'm sure there are people who will like your content as well. Try not to stress too much about it. Just think that in the future people will visit your old videos and enjoy seeing the way you were then. Life happens just once and is too short not to try our dreams. I want to know that if nothing else, I can smile because I tried",

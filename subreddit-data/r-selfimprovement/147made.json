I have anxiety and agoraphobia but I want to do this step. I want to have fun and try to be with myself and discover my strength. I know I will be anxious but I\u2019m sure it will worth it and I\u2019ll feel great after that and who knows I might stay longer.",

I work at a pet store and pretty much everyone has social anxiety except for me, it's a 10 person crew.  I'm a 40m, Leo, raised by good parents that are still married, I have 3 sisters and no brothers and I've moved around a bit.  I think these things factor into why I don't have social anxiety.  I've been working with my coworkers for about 4-5 years and they all still have social anxiety and the same triggers.  I talk to them about it a lot and I challenge them to get out of their comfort zone.  I don't know how a person overcomes their anxiety and the things that trigger their anxiety???  I believe that challenging yourself and trying to overcome your fears can help.  Then again my fear of heights has never gone away.  If someone has suggestions or ideas on how to overcome your anxiety then I'm all ears.",

What you said in the end goes for me too. No matter how many times I go somewhere (even every day) I still I\u2019m in the verge of having a panic attack. I\u2019m not sure if it will ever go away but lately I developed a mindset that goes as: \u201cit\u2019s there okay, let it be there I don\u2019t give a fuck anymore\u201d and it kinda helped",

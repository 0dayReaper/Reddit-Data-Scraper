            "comment": "The best analogy for grief I've heard is to imagine a box. Inside of the box is a button (symbolizes sadness), also inside the box is a ball that bounces around. When the grief is new, the ball is massive, and it'll keep hitting the button. But over time, the ball gets smaller. Every now and then, the ball will still hit the button, but it won't happen as often.\n\nGrief is a result of losing something you truly loved. That's nothing to be ashamed of. But dwelling on it is keeping you trapped. Over time, your scars will fade. They're just a facet of who you are, and make up your story.\n\nYou also need to keep in mind, you're in the midst of puberty, you've got hormones making you feel all sorts of crazy stuff right now. Try not to overthink it too much.\n\nAll this being said though, you need to move on. That may seem cold, but as time goes by, you'll have other experiences to have. This is just one of them.",

    "postText": "I've been red pilled all my life, mainly because of childhood, being insecure my whole life, never being attractive to girls etc. Thats why I fell into this in the first place. On youtube everyone sees to think red pill is right, like how to be attractive, how to get girls. Its soooo tempting for 21 yo guy to do this stuff and be attractive. But on reddit, discord, everyone seem to hate it. Red pill made me so lonely and scared to meet girls and desperate for relationship. But  I have no idea what to do without it.",

Here are a few books that are great for beginners:\r  \n\r  \n\"**7 Habits of Highly Effective People**\" by Stephen R. Covey - This book provides timeless wisdom on productivity, time management, and effectiveness.\r\n\n\"**How to Win Friends and Influence People**\" by Dale Carnegie - This is a classic book on understanding people and building relationships.\r\n\n\"**Mindset: The New Psychology of Success**\" by Carol S. Dweck - This book introduces the concept of 'fixed' and 'growth' mindsets, and how our beliefs about our abilities can impact our success.\r\n\n\"**Atomic Habits**\" by James Clear - My favorite one! This book offers practical strategies for forming good habits, breaking bad ones, and mastering the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.\r\n\n\"**The Power of Now**\" by Eckhart Tolle - A classic! This book explores the concept of mindfulness and living in the present moment.",

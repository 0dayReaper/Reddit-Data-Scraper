    "postText": "I've noticed that in my life, people who are the closest with me are the people I am most comfortable to be mean to. \nAs I have got older I have noticed this character flaw and have worked a lot towards being more careful of what I say or do to people. \nIf I'm being completely honest, I've actually become scared to create more in depth relationships because of the fear of losing people anyway. \nEven though I'm in a place in my life where I'm improving myself a lot and doing things to become a better person (while I understand that can be a lonely road) it's still lonely. \n\nHere's an example, I started to get into video games and have become very close with someone I met online.. at first I was never snippy or rude.. but the closer we got the more I noticed things about this person annoy me or tbings they say. And I hate that I am doing this! \n\nThis is what I do in relationships with men and I point out (or silently notice) their flaws or things I find I don't like.. and I want to fix myself from doing this. \n\nA little back story of my childhood is that I grew up in a very angry non loving home.. no affection, no I love you, no \"you can do it, I believe in you..\" \nso I wonder if I just subconsciously begin to hate because I associate that with love? \n\nI want to change but I find that when I get close to people, I become a bitch.. hence why most of my relationships never last :(. \n\nAdvice? P.s therapy has not helped.",

I don't know about you, but in his case it's a mix of perfectionism, pessimism, low self steem, fragile ego, overly self-critical (and, by extension, too judgemental of others), impatience, stuborness, unrealistic expectations and prejudiced beliefs.\n\nCan't answer more in depth right now, but if therapy isn't helping, you either didn't meet the right therapist/s or you didn't go in with the right mindset. I know my father would shrug off useful advice just because he's still in denial about so many of his issues, for example.",

            "comment": "Maybe try a different therapy modality like IFS if you feel like this issue goes back to the way you were raised.  \n\nA suggestion if therapy isn\u2019t helping like you hope is maybe get a therapy workbook and try journaling as you go through it and go to your actual therapist when you find questions you can\u2019t answer, or when you come to realization that you want to put into practice but aren\u2019t sure how.\n\nI think a lot of it is a combination of self awareness, deciding to take different actions, and then just practice and repetition until it states to feel less difficult or unnatural.\n\nLike if you have self awareness that maybe your impulses are based on false childhood beliefs that people who care about each other backbite and criticize, and you accept that that isn\u2019t how you want to live life, when you feel yourself thinking mean thoughts that might find their way to spoken words, take a quick break, remember that it\u2019s not appropriate and you don\u2019t want to live that way, and if possible, say something nice instead.  See how that goes and how you feel and either journal about it or discuss in therapy.",

            "comment": "I have the same problem. It has gotten worse as I've gotten older and it was real bad when I lived with my mom. I've done it to past gfs, family members and friends, but mostly people of the opposite sex. I think a big part of it is becoming complacent and instead of trying to grow in a relationship I get hung up on the things that annoy me or I feel like because they're my relative/partner I have I take them for granted and to some extent feel as though I judge them more harshly on what they say because I want them to align with my viewpoints. Yikes, typing it out makes me sound awful. I have gotten a lot better and feel badly on how I have behaved in the past, something that has helped a lot is using the THINK acronym before I speak up.",

            "comment": "I understand what you're going through, I've experienced similar patterns in my own life. \n\nFor instance, I noticed that I tended to distance myself emotionally from others to avoid potential harm, a defense mechanism rooted in the trauma from my early years. \n\nYou've already taken the important first step in recognizing this pattern in yourself, which shows an impressive level of self-awareness.\n\nWe often develop coping strategies early in life, depending on our upbringing, as was the case for me. I learned early on to suppress my feelings as a survival mechanism due to my father's harsh punishments. \n\nIt seems that in your case, you could be projecting past hurt onto present relationships, because it's what you've known from a young age. \n\nThe good news is that self-improvement is a journey, not a destination. We're always learning and growing. \n\nRecognizing the triggers that lead you to act out can help. With this awareness, you might be able to better manage your reactions. \n\nI'd suggest seeking a different form of therapy. If one form hasn't worked for you, that doesn't mean others won't either. I've found talk therapy and group support particularly helpful in my journey. \n\nYou're brave for wanting to make changes, and it's possible to shift these patterns over time.

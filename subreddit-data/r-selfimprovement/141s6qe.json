    "postText": "**(My opinion)** If you don't feel confident, its because you don't fully love yourself. In my younger life, I struggled with general confidence and major body dysmorphia. Through the years not much about me visually changed except for my perception of myself. I started loving the little things about myself such as my hair, my voice, and my body. I realized the beauty in uniqueness and as a result developed a large base of self confidence . Hope this message can reach my people!",

I was one of those people that thought I never needed therapy (ha) but my job was causing so much anxiety and stress. I left that toxic dump of a job and I\u2019ll thank those assholes one day. This experience helped me get my life back-the life I didn\u2019t even know I was missing. I\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do, but this past Saturday I looked at myself in the mirror while getting my hair done and for the first time in YEARS loved the person looking back at me! It was pretty wonderful.",

I\u2019ve heard stories about bad therapists and it takes so much courage to go..I can\u2019t imagine doing only to get a bad one. Thankfully I got a referral from someone I trust. I had no idea how life changing it would be! Our parents do their best, mine had some really messed up things happen to them and they did exactly as I did, packed it away and thought it would be fine. \n\nA therapist friend of mine (not my therapist) shared this a few weeks ago and it put the experience of getting into therapy into eloquent words-she nailed it!\n\n\u201cMuch of the reason we attend therapy is because our dysfunctional and now \"ill-fitting\" coping skills aren't working anymore and our strategically sculpted masks are starting to fall down. This causes great anxiety. Sometimes the expectation is that going to therapy will fix it. But a healthy therapeutic process involves the relinquishing of these old coping skills and providing a safe place to uncomfortably lay down the masks. The therapeutic space is a deep struggle to release what is old - what might have worked in childhood as a necessity for survival, but does not work in the realm of adulthood - and to find the new...or the original...of who one is now...or who they are meant to be...and to identify new tools and ways of being that don't involve fear, anxiety and pure childlike survival.\u201d",

I have been just coming out of self-loathing of my body and mind, but I thought at least my character; however, I was in a situation where it would be questioned, and I started to disassociate with myself more than ever before. I finally finished a book about radical self-acceptance, and it helped me so much to allow myself to compassionately feel those challenging emotions I avoided. The work is never done, but I know I have made more improvements than before. It's a practice, but I am becoming more myself and loving myself. I've been working on advocacy, cleaning/maintenance, and lil bit on my communications skills. I can slip up or not be 100%, but at least I start again and acknowledge that good enough is perfect. This helps me deal with procrastination or feeling paralyzed. In school, I remember my teacher telling us that in our field, you have to believe people can change. Is it easy? Not really, but it can adapt with time. So if I can believe it for other people, why can't I do that for myself? Today was a slip day, but I got back into doing the work again tonight, and tomorrow is a new day.",

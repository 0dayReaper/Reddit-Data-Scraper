            "comment": "Hey there! Aside from the usual stuff like working out and taking care of yourself, another great way to improve and control those feelings of physical insecurity is by challenging yourself to step out of your comfort zone. Try new things that push your boundaries and build your confidence. Whether it's taking a dance class, trying a new sport, or even joining a public speaking club, taking on these challenges can help you grow and gain a sense of accomplishment.\r There\u00b4s this cool app that adds a fun twist to self-improvement. You set goals for yourself, like trying a new activity or facing a fear, and if you don't complete the task and provide evidence within a certain timeframe, you lose a bit of money as a \"forfeit.\" It's like a friendly reminder to stay accountable and motivated.",

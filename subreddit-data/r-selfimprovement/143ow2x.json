    "postText": "Some people have mentioned i\u2019m excited and talk a lot about my trip next week. It made me really anxious that people think this about me. \nI\u2019m also going with newer people in my life and I\u2019m scared they are gonna find me annoying. I\u2019m scared they are going to have a negative image of me. I hate how close to my trip i\u2019m feeling so negative about it because i\u2019ve been wanting to go for so long. I\u2019m just so scared people won\u2019t like me when they get to know me more. I feel too much for people sometimes and I know that sometimes I am. I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to be myself around others and not care about their opinions. I think it\u2019s just really hard because I barely like myself as is.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips or advice?",

Im sure you get a rush of anxiety, your heart starts beating fast, shortness of breath? If you dwell on this when you are actually there with your friends it will effect your internal comfort levels &amp; play out exactly how you imagine it would.\n\nYou must consciously choose to imagine &amp; assume everything will play out ideally which will give you a lightness. It will free you up inside. Choose to accept that whatever happens, is happening, ideally for you.\n\nIf you find your mind tending to wander toward the negative, remember to control your breath, deepen it. Get present.\n\nA positive thought &amp; a negative thought cannot exist in the same place simultaneously.\n\nPositive thoughts are also far superior in power.\n\nYou've got this. Just breath. Relax. Surrender to the flow my friend!",

It is impossible to please everyone (and why should we really). Just know that while there might be people who find it annoying, there will also be people who will enjoy your company. You liven the atmosphere.  Just be yourself, whatever that means. However you\u2019re comfortable with. The right people will stay. And those who don\u2019t, don\u2019t matter.",

    "postText": "I don\u2019t think people realize how important it is to self analyze, asking yourself why and how behind every major decision and breaking yourself down in order to understand each piece of the puzzle.\n\n\nI\u2019m the type of person who sometimes can be motivated and sometimes be depressed. I\u2019m working on it but my point was I again failed some of my daily goals in order to get closer to my big goal.\n\n\nI just wanted somewhere I could say, it won\u2019t happen again. I don\u2019t have the luxury  of time or energy to deal with this. \n\nI realize that I\u2019m always lacking control and that\u2019s not gonna bring me anywhere, It doesn\u2019t matter if Im happy or if I\u2019m sad, I will only focus on my \ngoals.  \n\nEven if no one replies, I wanna thank you guys for giving me a place where I can vent. Because if I don\u2019t take control, who will.",

It's almost like they are putting us to school as a way of distraction! \n\nI come from a low socioeconomic family, my parents are poor academics and know nothing about making money. I just watched an interview with \"Robert T. Kiyosaki (who wrote Rich dad poor dad) and he says he didn't go to school, he got rich because he studied Money and knew how to play the system. I am sick of being poor living pay check by pay check. Where can I learn how to become rich?\n\nIs anyone here rich and can give me some advice please?",

The algorithm changes recently mean they're pushing much smaller channels forward at a faster rate. \n\nProblem is... Many many people get disheartened by the slow growth and give up. Good things come to those who earn it though.\n\nYou can't build a strong mind or muscular body any easier than a YouTube channel or any other business overnight. It takes consistent work and effort",

Most people who want to earn money don\u2019t know their cost of living, the cost of what they want, and see it like a figment of their imagination. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to have money, you want a certain quality of life, these are very different things and though they\u2019re linked they\u2019re no identical. I work 5 hours a week and that pays all my bills but I make less than 10,000 a year, or would you prefer to make 100,000 at 80 hours per week? It\u2019s things like this that help us see what we want. \n\n1$ is not a 1$. Here it buys you a water, maybe some bread but in another country it can get you far more. If you leverage things like this you can increase your quality of life with minor changes. It can really be as simple as getting a decent remote job in the US and then living abroad. \n\nMost people shout about making a business, which has its merits but so does working for someone else, mainly you don\u2019t have to build anything from scratch and you get to learn while you get paid. \n\nA certain economic quality of life doesn\u2019t guarantee and increase in satisfaction. It\u2019s only people who are satisfied with what they have, not those begging for more, that can actually enjoy it. For most people the more money stops beings the one \u201cbogeyman\u201d that would fix all our problems if we had it we realize that it was always our state of mind that makes life unpleasant. \n\nIf you really want advice, learn to be completely content with your life as it is and then see if you still have the desire to get rich and if so, by all means, go for it. Money isn\u2019t inherently good or bad but it depends who\u2019s getting it and for why. \n\nDon\u2019t let morals be for sale. Because no matter how much you get you can\u2019t pay off the debt you\u2019ve made to your soul with money because that\u2019s not it\u2019s currency, whatever error you make there you take with you for life, unlike money which, even with good investments, a great job, can be gone in a day.",

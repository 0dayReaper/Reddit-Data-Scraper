I used to face these same problems, I was really bad at decision-making, I was fat, broke, and not even taking care of myself. But since I 180'd my life by changing my way of thinking (the one they forced me to use in society I could lift myself up. That's why I created a free newsletter about men's mental health, Ik it's overlooked by most men, but it's actually the reason why everyone is sad and lack discipline.",

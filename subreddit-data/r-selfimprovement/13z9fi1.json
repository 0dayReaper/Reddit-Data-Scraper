In other words, because you didn\u2019t make a conscious decision to do these things, that you somehow lack the personality to make those decisions. And thinking about that lack of agency can certainly be depressing. \n\nFortunately, it doesn\u2019t work that way forever. And it\u2019s part of the reason why the trope of \u201cmy child went to college and COMPLETELY CHANGED! :( \u201c still exists.\n\ntl;dr you don\u2019t lack personality, you lack personhood.\n\nInstead of focusing on what has been decided for you in the past and leading up to this moment in your life, focus on the things _you_ want to do in life, and what specific steps you will need to take to get there. It may sound corny, but look up articles on writing a personal mission statement. Putting words to what *your* goals and values are will help you communicate what is important to you to others, and find those other people who share your goals and values.\n\nGood luck!",

If you haven\u2019t tried them yet, cognitive behavioral therapy and possibly medication might be a good idea.\n\nAnd before you think I\u2019m trying to pass this off as \u201ceasily fixed with talk and pills\u201d, you should know that I didn\u2019t start to think this critically about the circumstances around my life until I was 40, had been on various medications over the past couple of decades, and found a therapist and treatment that clicked with me.\n\nThere is nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with what you are thinking or how you are thinking it, except that you believe that it\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d. Or perhaps more accurately, because your brain shows it to you as wrong.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy was beneficial to me because the therapist doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t just sit there and listen and overlook all of the bullshit. CBT can\u2019t go back and change history, but it can shift the perspective your brain uses to show you those events.\n\nFor example; I got kicked out of an exclusive high school. When I would think about that time, I\u2019d focus on what a failure I felt like at the time, and all the people I felt I had let down, and all the mistakes I had made. CBT cut through the self-depreciating BS and introduced the thought that the high school had let me down by failing to teach me in a way that I could successfully learn from. It didn\u2019t invalidate all of the other things I thought, and certainly didn\u2019t wipe them from my memory, but it refused to let me continue using it as a source of blame and loathing that somehow I brought all of this failure upon myself.\n\nI think change is in your future. The only question is when.",

    "postText": "I used to think these complexities where only limited to social media. For example, every time I\u2019m on YouTube, I am bound to see an absurd podcast group talking vehemently about some obscure relationship standard. Even though I don\u2019t consume these types of videos and make a point to remove them from my recommendations, sometimes they still pop up. \n\nI tried having irl relationships but I found that a lot of people actually hold these same crazy standards that are being plastered all over social media. And it makes sense because if most people today are consumed by social media, they are bound to internalize what they see and hear. \n\nAny also realize that a lot of people who are on those podcast type of videos exhibit traits of mental illness? Specifically dark triad traits like narcissism, sociopathy, or even unhealthy attachment styles just to name a few? \n\nPeople hear advice/mindsets from them and are bound to imitate it in their own personal lives. It\u2019s so uncomfortable that other people hear these podcasters and think they are right. \n\nPresently, I am withdrawing from pursing relationships. I am sick of how complicated people make them. Does anybody else feel like this? I\u2019d rather just have none rather than make complicated something I feel shouldn\u2019t be. Love that is shown in relationships should not be complicated. It should be genuine. I shouldn\u2019t have to worry about so many nuances to try and scope if another human being is going to have my best interests at heart.",

Like it\u2019s probably something so wild. I know somebody who said that women are annoying when everything seems to be going nice when they are starting off dating/ getting to know each other but then they ruin it by telling them that they\u2019ve been traumatized from childhood sexual assault\u2026\n\nIn this one example, it seems some men (and women too) just want a perfect human being who doesn\u2019t have any problems whether it be small or big. \nBut no human being is like that. \n\nI think this is one reason why relationships and marriages fall apart when one party starts going through a big life problem. The other person was not in the relationship because of their genuine love for the other person but because of something fallible. So when it does happen, they start to \u201close\u201d the person who, in their mind, they were attracted to. \n\nLike maybe this is my biggest point: So many people want a (romantic) relationship based off of what the other person can give them, what they do.",

It also goes to show how copy and paste people are and even more so online. Like, how many of the same people are we going to see with zero facial expressions and zero intonation in their voice telling us some rigid belief system that runs more like a business than what you would experience when in a loving relationship? \n\nThere are so many pitfalls from the stigma of mental illness. One being that it\u2019s so misunderstood and the majority of people only really see it as depression and anxiety. They don\u2019t see the other kinds which are more revolve around manipulating other people. To be narcissistic, etc. is to be crowned as some sort of winner in society. So people like that will continue run things. No surprise most of the top careers are filled with dark triad types. Maybe it\u2019s just human nature right?",

                            "comment": "The second paragraph feels very similar to my last romantic relationship, but the gender roles reversed. We both had very similar values, upbringings so we could relate to each other, and goals in life. I knew it would be a good amount of work because we both had issues, myself being an eating disorder, but I was in the mindset of because of all these similarities, let\u2019s work on ourselves and help the other become the person they want to be, her, not so much. She would get stressed easily, and had some anger issues, nothing physical, just got heated easily. When she got stressed, I was there for her, but when I was, she said \u201cyou\u2019re stressing me out.\u201d It seemed like I had to be this perfect person all the time and not allowed to have any negative emotions. I got stressed too when she got stressed, at the time we were very close together often due to us being on the same research project for her thesis/my job, but I would allow her to have those feelings cuz people get frustrated. If she wanted someone to cuddle/hug, I was there, when she wanted some space to relax, I gave it to her. At first it seemed like she was very sympathetic to my condition, but when my ED affected things that directly involved her, she was very unsympathetic. I made many small mistakes making some graphs for our research project, at the time I had 0 energy, I was experiencing some post illness issues, and with my ED it was a big challenge. I was barely able to stay awake during work, couldn\u2019t focus, and would then sleep not long after I got home at 5:30. She knew all of this, but because I wasn\u2019t perfect on the graphs and it affected her, she exploded and yelled \u201care you fucking stupid!?!?\u201d She apologized later, but still wasn\u2019t sympathetic when I made some more little mistakes on the graphs. She was putting the figures together with the graphs and she said it took her a long time to redo it each time I made changes. I even asked her to show me how she did it at the very beginning so I could go in and make the next one or fix mistakes, she thought it was a waste of time cuz she assumed my work would be perfect. Later when I asked her to show me again how to do it, cuz she kept getting frustrated having to redo the figures, saying it took about an hour. She just said (with a very annoyed tone), \u201cno one had to show me how to do it.\u201d So she refused to help. So I went in on my own, and turns out the work she was redoing could\u2019ve been done in less than a minute cuz of a function she didn\u2019t know existed. I wanted to work closely together for the graph/figure making and writing of the manuscript cuz I knew we could help each other with little stuff like that and catch errors right away, she wanted her to do her part, me to do mine, and have both be perfect right away coming together. She even made it a \u201cboundary\u201d that I send work with less errors. And she got upset with me twice cuz I said I wasn\u2019t able to work on the project after work at all in my free time. She passive aggressively said something like \u201cI want to work with people who put in that effort.\u201d She knew I had 0 energy at the time, plus I wanted to enjoy life too even if I had the energy. There\u2019s more too but I\u2019ve already ranted a lot.\n\nTLDR, my ex also made me question having relationships due to expectations of perfection",

But it\u2019s good that you are no longer in that relationship which did not recognize your needs, neglected, and made you feel bad for them. \n\nIt just starts a cycle of people not being able to express themselves fully in relationships because of this expectation that they have to be perfect. In terms of men, they might feel that their lives are centered around the expectation to be a perfect man. They don\u2019t get to be a regular feel-y human.\n\nWhich, I think might have to do with why some men, like the one I mentioned, also have no regard or time for the real struggles of women. Since they aren\u2019t allowed to express their own emotions, they also want women to fit this ideal of a \u201cperfect princess\u201d in their relationship.\n\nOne of my insecurities has to do with my intelligence. I\u2019m really not so smart sometimes and my mind races a lot so I just have to many things going on at once. I have ADHD so sometimes when I speak it doesn\u2019t really make sense to everybody else. I will be really forgetful. Mix words and stutter when I talk. I also have dyscalculia which is like dyslexia but with numbers so I\u2019m bad at math and it takes me too long to do simple operations. So all of these things on the surface make me seem like I\u2019m dumb. \nI really don\u2019t want someone to think I\u2019m dumb. I went to school with a lot of smart borderline genius students. They really looked down on me and treated me badly because they saw me as dumb. \nEspecially in a relationship, it makes me uncomfortable and hurts that I will be the stereotypical pretty but dumb/slow girlfriend. People never take me seriously.",

It got to the point that it was super hard to communicate any of my needs with her.

Not that adults are always better\u2026 That really sounds like such a similar feeling, like \u201cI literally can\u2019t do this cuz of something completely out of my control that makes it harder, thanks for making me feel even more insecure and worthless cuz of it \ud83e\udd72\u201d. I\u2019m so sorry you didn\u2019t feel valued or taken seriously :(. I had lots of similar instances with my last.

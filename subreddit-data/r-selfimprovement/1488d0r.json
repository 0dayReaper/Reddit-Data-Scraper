But I\u2019ve seen their posts since freaking March (they\u2019ve prob been here for longer) and they are a broken record just repeating the same things. \n\nI\u2019m mainly frustrated because people repeatedly give them lengthy and well thought out advice and they just regurgitate the same absurd broken-record phrases. \n\nMods please do something? It\u2019s becoming more than annoying. \n\nUser is u/Refrigeratorkey1518 \n\nI can\u2019t be the only one completely fed up with their bs.",

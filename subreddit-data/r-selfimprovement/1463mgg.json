I know this is a problem with many men across the world . My ex wife wanted to control each and every portion of my life , but i didn't give in. I finally let go of the toxic relationship and I am now with a beautiful woman , who supports my every decision",

There is no shame in exploring different avenues in life. What you think is tying toh down, you have the choice to let it go. We all have the same problems , some of us choose to explore while some of us give excuses . How is your life going to change , if you don't put in the work to fuel your passions",

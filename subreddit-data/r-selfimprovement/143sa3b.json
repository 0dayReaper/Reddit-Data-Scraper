You know you don\u2019t like what happens when you\u2019re angry.\n\nIf you were really motivated enough, you\u2019d stop.\n\nI decided being responsible for my child, that I am done being an angry person, who I became because of my angry father.\n\nDoes anger completely serve you?\n\nWhat will? \n\nLet it go dude and be well to yourself.",

Once you can be aware you can start talking yourself down and lowering your anxiety, which in my case is what triggers my anger response. This is a long-term project. Don\u2019t expect it to work over one day or even one week. Just try to build that habit.",

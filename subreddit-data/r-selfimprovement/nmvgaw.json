If you were diagnosed with a physical illness and you needed time to recover from that, your friends wouldn't leave you. Then why should a good friend leave you when you're recovering from your mental health?\n\nBe wary of people who don't want you to get better. They're not good people to be around.",

Monopolizing conversations with your issues on an extended basis (we all need special attention from time to time, but if it\u2019s all the time, you\u2019re not treating them like a friend).\n\n3. Long-term refusal to actually work on your issues.\n\n4. Basically expecting a lot but not giving a lot. Lack of effort in the friendship. Dipping out on their milestone events, etc. \n\nEveryone has low points, but if one person is *always* caring for the other, that\u2019s not fair. The good news is that, even with mental illness, putting effort into relationships usually improves depressive or anxious symptoms.",

I tend to have a habit of not putting myself back out there when I am feeling better though. My closest friends are patient and understanding, which I am very grateful for and I feel most comfortable returning to them even if it\u2019s been some time since I last reached out. Sometimes though, when I think about other friendships I\u2019ve let fall away, I \u201cblame\u201d it on my mental health and let it slide, when in reality, I know that I haven\u2019t been in an episode the whole time, so really I just let it happen and excuse it with \u201ci have depression and just can\u2019t maintain friendships.\u201d The existence of my other friends prove this wrong. \n\nI think if I did a better job of returning to the people I wasn\u2019t as close with to begin with, those relationships could grow into stronger ones, but I don\u2019t always let myself because I know I\u2019m going to withdraw again. Many of those people probably view me as flaky or inconsistent or as a bad friend because I haven\u2019t maintained honesty or communication. I am working on transparency so as I make new relationships with people I care about/want to grow with, they can understand where I\u2019m coming from and hopefully be more patient, but ultimately it\u2019s a two way street so I have to do my part too.",

I finally sent her a long text because I was worried she'd react violently. She had recently had a physical fight with her brother and keyed a guys car because he commented negatively when she smashed the door into his car. Started talking non-sense about anti-masking and nut trusting the government, made disparaging comments about other women and trans people.... I have never felt lighter.

YOU are the only person responsible for your mental health, your friends and family can be there for you from time to time, that's nice of them, but you cannot expect them to do that. There are therapists and pills for curing depression, sadly they don't always work well but for most people they do. So 1) recognize that you have a problem 2) seek professional help for that 3) feel free to share your problem with your beloved people without expecting a therapy from them.

                            "comment": "I've been making youtube videos on a series called Resident Evil for over a decade now, and I meet a group of friends through it. We played games a lot together and talked about the series a lot together. Around 2017 I deleted my youtube channel as well as other things and destroyed some things in my house after reading a journal entry from my mom that pretty much says I'm a terrible son. I became self-destructive and destroyed all my hard work and went into a deep bout of depression and stagnation for 2 years. The group of friends I hung around was affected by my poor mood, nasty attitude, and unstable emotions for those 2 years and we always began having different opinions about the newer entries in the series starting with RE7, and didn't see eye to eye on a lot of things.\n\nOne of my \"best friends\" in the group is a self-proclaimed bigot and argues his opinions are facts and doesn't really listen when I argued why I liked and didn't like certain things in general. This was a new way of acting for him since he started college with film school, using how films are made, games are made, and other logical arguments to argue how you should and shouldn't feel about movies, games etc, so we began to drift apart over that. In late 2018 I began job searching and appearing less online on discord, steam, and other game consoles since I finally got out of my deep depression and wanted to get into the workforce since for decades I struggled with mental illness (paranoia schizophrenia) and my group friend knew this because I've explained in length that sometimes I'll do and say things that are confusing and not true and delusional.\n\nI never had any real jobs in my life and wanted one because relying on my mom was painful since she didn't really care about anyone in the house but she and it seems my ssi money wasn't being spent correctly and was always borderline starving for most of my life. (6'3 feet at 160 pounds for most of my life). My friends would buy me food every once and awhile. When I finally got my first job I had to deal with a lot of harassment because of my mental illness and doing weird things and looking flat all the time. I ended up quitting and getting another 2 jobs within a year with my longest one lasting a year and ending because of a combination of covid and mental health issues.\n\nMy bigot friend (ex friend) around late 2019 suddenly came out of nowhere saying I'm a horrible person. I flip flop on my opinions for years, I'm not a true Resident Evil fan because I had more criticism about newer RE games versus anything good, I lie about liking certain movies and games to make people feel good (related to flip-flopping), and that I'm running a cult in a way because I always got people to play games I wanted to play and didn't play games anyone else wanted me to play.  Other friends who were there backed me up to combat his crazy outburst. He said he's been keeping tabs on how I think and act for over 5 years.\n\nHalf of the things he said were confusing because of my mental illness so I just believed him for most of it and others like flip-flopping and game choices were bull. My old group of friends preferred Japanese Style RPG and campy games which I didn't but gave them a shot anyway and we played several games they recommended to me such as 7 days to die, Kingdom hearts, Devil may cry, Bayonetta, etc, so I was confused but then he finally let that go and went on about movies and game opinion flip-flopping. I said to him that sometimes when I watch movies I miss a lot and have to watch them over again to understand it more which changes my opinions and his knowledge of movies and what he catches onto and shares with me gives me new insights, and he claims that I'm wrong for changing my opinions and views on things\n\nEventually, we split and my mental health dropped. This seriously affected me at work since this person claimed to be my best friend and helped me for years with food and equipment, which ultimately led to me struggling with my most recent job before having to leave because of constant manic episodes coupled with dropped hours due to covid which added to more stress. I became an asshole to my friends and more withdrawn for the past couple of months and ranted about my friend he left me after spilling so much bs about me from a list of things he tracked for 5 yeears.\n\nAnother friend who was watching the stream somehow assumed I was talking specifically about him even though I was vague in who I was talking about. This guy cussed me out on discord before unfriending me so I took another hit to my mental. He was told he was misunderstanding my stream by my other friends who were still dealing with my madness but he didn't care and last thing he said is that I was always negatively affecting his life because he always thought about how bad my childhood was as a child when I showed up. I was always bullied as a kid because of my weirdness and being black back in the 90s and early 2000s and liking exclusively rock music on top of facing abuse mental and physical from my sister without my mom caring to do anything which I only shared with the whole group once during a night everyone was getting personal after we watched bates motel together.\n\nThis guy leaving split the group in two and with my mental health affecting how I was interacting with everyone, everyone slowly began to drift away from me in favor of the guy who misunderstood my stream and left to his own group. Everyone ban lying to me about being too busy to hang out with me which was confirmed when I went on dead by daylight and saw the group online and playing. That game has its own client so everyone was hiding offline on steam and discord for the most part. That was the final straw and I went off on my own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nForgot to mention that I also went on a month-long break which I announced because I was aware of how I was treating my friends and how bad things were for me since that incident in late 2019, but I came back early and started talking to one of my friends. Everyone vanished from my discord but appeared on various games talking and playing with each other. This made me feel really left out and no one seemed interested in hanging out with me and that's where the lies and stuff started because they wanted to avoid me and the eventual cut-off. They just preferred the other guy over me. I eventually got over my issues and currently going through vocational rehab, but everyone is gone so now I'm struggling with loneliness therefore suicidal thoughts.",

Friends that don't want you to get better, or just drop you as a friend because you didn't keep in constant contact, even if you're ill, they aren't real friends. I have several friends that I don't get to see often, and we don't text consistently. When we do, it's like nothing ever changed. People get busy or sick or struggle sometimes. Sometimes that means they can't keep contact with more than a couple people at a time. Sometimes they can't handle anyone. A true, real friend won't let the time that passes destroy the relationship.\n\nI actually figured out that I had a couple \"friends\" that were pretty much faking it. We texted and we met up and hung out. However when I started struggling and was unable to initiate conversation all the time, they didn't text me either. Not to check up on me, not to just chat, just no communication. I didn't burden them with my problems at all. That's when I realized that I was the only one invested in the relationships.",

I\u2019ve been dealing with severe depression and suicidal thoughts for a while, as well as harming myself to the point of bleeding before, with no professional help able to help me, and my dad throwing away all the medication I had. I was going through a rough time, but before that that rough time I was always there for my friends on discord, I talked with them, I played with them, I did everything with them basically and helped them with their problems, but when everything started to fall apart, they began to ignore me (They new I had problems), they wouldn\u2019t even greet me when I joined the server, they didn\u2019t invite me to play anything, and even went out together without me. Throughout this period I was feeling worst due to it, but still I kept initiating conversations and offering to play with them, and joining the server everyday and greeting them with no reply as well try to make plans to go out. Then one thought crossed my mind about them leaving me and I immediately started crying, so the next day I joined the server and asked calmly whether they would be there for me while I\u2019m in this situation, and they couldn\u2019t even give me and answer and just laughed at me even though I told them I was serious. Later on I found out from that same friend\u2019s cousin that he\u2019s been talking shit behind my back, saying he\u2019s had enough of me, while the other people thought I was faking for attention, but for some reason I couldn\u2019t believe it, it was like my mental health was on the line, so I talked to those same people and asked them again if they would simply just be here for me, they couldn\u2019t answer, but then they proceeded to say that they will give me advice as they know about my suicidal thoughts, one of them told me to go die and that he didn\u2019t really care, the other didn\u2019t even stop him from saying that and continued to say he\u2019s been helping me this entire time even though he clearly hasn\u2019t, and the other one just ignored it and only ever texted me to use me for something. During the whole time as a whole I do admit that at some point with one of them I tried to get him do some therapy for me (which was wrong to push my problems onto him so aggressively) but that\u2019s it, my mind is still in a weird state and even though it seems nearly clear that these individuals aren\u2019t very good people, I really need some verbal confirmation in order to solidify that fact in my head, so I can stop thinking back to them throughout my life so far and doubting whether they were bad or not. I need it.",

I've always poorly taken care of my teeth and felt insecure about my smile, so when a crown fell out after COVID started I was initially very insecure and upset. I wanted to start dating and was feeling confident about that for the first time, now I basically have no tooth right smack dab in the middle of my teeth.\n\nSo what got me to calm down about that was observing those negative thoughts that came in about it, without judgement (that thought is right, that thought is wrong, etc.) and that it was not **me** who decided to have that thought.\n\nOutside of that working on my self-confidence (I AM enough) so that if that thought came through, or even if someone said something about my missing tooth, that I would feel comfortable enough to make a joke about it - \"Yeah, I got in a fight, but you should see the other guy!\" or \"It's from my professional hockey days\" (I'm a skinny white dude).\n\nAt the end of the day, people who judge you on things like hair loss or things like that are people that you don't want to have in your life - so in a way, it's a positive to weed out negativity from your life in external circumstances.\n\nFeel free to DM me any time or if I can help in any other way! :)",

Only you give meaning to that loneliness, no one else.\n\nTry this: everytime you catch yourself focusing on loneliness or anxiety, refocus your attention to whatever it is you're doing (reading, working. etc). It's gonna be hard at first (and your mind will want to come back to those bad thoughts because it's a habit), but doing it regularly will change your life. Look up mindfulness and meditation, it changed my life. I use the Headspace app, it has courses on both of these subjects. \n\nMeditating teaches you to focus one on thing at a time, and that's ultimately how you achieve freedom from nasty and anxious thoughts. Whenever you catch yourself thinking about them, just gently refocus your attention on the present (or whatever you're currently doing). You will notice that, in time, these anxious thoughts lose their power over you. \n\nCheers, and happy new year",

I have decided that for 2021 I am going to become stable. I know that trying to \u2018get better\u2019 in just a year is a huge thing and is a very stressful goal (not what I want) so I\u2019ve decided that if I can become stable, and can get to a point where I have no more than 2 off days a month for 4 months or more in a row I will count that as a successful year. \n\nAt the moment my mental state is so poor than I have at least 12-15 off days a month. Occasionally less. I don\u2019t want to live like this anymore so I am going to change.",

It was you at the base of the stairs, it was you resting midway, and it is you at the top.You existed in all those moments.  There wasn 't a bad you and a good you. There wasn't a failed version of you and a triumphant one.It was all you in various moments of doing, learning, being\u2026.  Each one brought you to a new vista where you could see choices and opportunities that you couldn 't see from where you stood before. It's you that 's making your way in the world. All of you.",

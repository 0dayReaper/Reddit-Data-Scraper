    "postText": "Don\u2019t think about you situation too much, you\u2019ll end up creating a problem that wasn\u2019t even there to begin with. \n\nThe mind is a very powerful tool. Everything begins and ends in your mind. What you give power to, has power over you, if you allow it. In retrospect, if you keep on thinking about a certain negative thing over and over again, it will control you mind, so far as it will be the first thing you\u2019ll think of when you wake up and the last thing before you sleep. Initially, it will completely take over 100% of your mind, a task that\u2019s very hard to get rid of. \n\nThe best way to live life is to stop thinking about the worst. Instead, think positively in a way that whatever happens happens and you\u2019ll learn from it, no matter the situation. A massive cause for people to panic, worry and become scared is overthinking. We are all guilty of this. Overthinking, quite frankly, ruins you. It will drain everything out of you, until there\u2019s nothing else left. Overthinking ruins the situation, twists and swirls everything around, makes you constantly worry in fear and makes everything worse, when in reality, there is no need for it. \n\nUnderstandably, saying \u201cturn your negative thoughts into positive\u201d isn\u2019t a walk in the park and doesn\u2019t just happen within thin air. It takes guts, time, patience and all your emotions to get through the darkest of days. As I said, time is crucial. It doesn\u2019t take a day, a week or even a month to get rid of negative thoughts inside of your head, it may take a few years, to ensure you\u2019re ready to let go of all the pain and torment your mind has gone through. But, believe you me, once you realise you\u2019re ready and you start to brighten up day by day, it will be the best feeling ever. :) \n\nYou don\u2019t get the same day twice in life. Today\u2019s date is September the 22nd 2020. Just a reminder, you\u2019re never going to see this day again, make the most of it!\n\nEdit: PM\u2019s are open for support. :)",

            "comment": "Ruminating is a killer. Therapy taught me some valuable tools to start to turn it around.\n\n- If you are stuck on a negative loop, instead of trying in vain to distract yourself, give the thoughts your full attention. But not all day long. Set a time. So at 6pm, I'd sit down without any distractions and think the thoughts. And you know what? It gets so boring really fast. Once you let your mind focus on them, it actually becomes easier to move on. \n\n- Don't just try to replace negative thoughts with overly positive thoughts that you don't actually believe. Instead, come up with some true, specific thoughts to counter the negative thoughts. So if you think \"no one likes me\" and you play out rejection scenarios in your head (guilty), don't replace that with \"people like me\" but instead have specific, true examples. \"My parents love and are proud of me\" or \"My friends Tom enjoys my company\" or \"my coworkers inquire about my life because they are interested in me as a person.\" Write them down. Carry them around. Do this with each thought.\n\n- Change the situations that usually lead to negative thoughts. I used to ruminate in bed a lot. So I had to learn to never lay in my bed if I wasn't sleeping. No lying awake in the morning. If I couldn't fall asleep at night, I would get up until I was tired then try again. \n\nEveryone is different, but Hopefully these tips might help someone. &lt;3",

She would actually get angry and argue with me when I would say positive things to try and help her with her outlook on things. It just blew my mind that anyone could wallow in such negativity. She is a miserable person that doesn\u2019t want to see things in a better light. She feeds off the negativity and tries to bring others down with her. So, sometimes you have to get rid of those relationships that only bring you down. We need to hold each other up and encourage each other.  Thank you for these posts!",

Especially with mental illnesses like depression and anxiety, you really see the world through a filter and you don't even realize it until the filter is lifted. It can actually be very frustrating to hear positive things in that state because it feels like someone is telling you that your reality is wrong but you're living it, so you know it's real to you, if that makes sense. \n\nI hope she gets better but you definitely have to prioritize your own mental health! No need to let someone else bring you down.",

I've heard about giving attention to the negative thoughts instead of trying to distract yourself, but if you don't mind me asking, what do you do when those thoughts come up at a time that isn't 6PM? Do you just keep reminding yourself that you'll think about it then? And what results did you have by doing this? I ask because I tried the same thing, but usually when I'm in the shower, the problem is that those thoughts still came up throughout the day, even with me giving realistic answers like your second point. \n\nThe situation thing is tough for me, because as a hobby I enjoy playing games, and unfortunately there's parts of playing games where your mind wanders, when things are slowed down etc. In fact, I feel like this with any hobby, eating, or even work. The problem with me is that I'm constantly thinking of things I should be doing.. and maybe that's a sign, that I should do more, idk. I just know that even when I was working hard, top employee, and even had talk of promotion, I had a mental breakdown and literally just quit. Other insecurities kicked in, like me not going out and having fun, or that I'm getting older, that there's so much I need to experience. This lead to desperation, which caused me to be awkward and even approached people in awkward times/ways which of course lead to rejection and more depression. Perhaps instead of chasing I should've worked out or done something productive, and then those things would've came to me- somehow I doubt it though.\n\nI'm really trying to reinforce my way of thinking, the happiest time of my life is when I got out of basic training lol. If only I could find a way to replicate that without starving myself from everything.",

It can help to know you'll have time later to dedicate to the thoughts, but the actual reduction in sudden thoughts is a slow process.\n\nI feel you about the video games. I used to with data entry where I just typed all afternoon and it was a place I'd often ruminate where I couldn't really do much about it. You can listen to podcasts and the like, but that's mostly just a distraction.\n\nI'm just a person who was treated, and only have the tools that worked for me. But I think you might get a lot out of a professional. Everything that worked for me was through cognitive behavioral therapy. They have so many strategies and know how to guide you through the process. Having a therapist can help you stick with it and they can point out small improvements that you don't see. It took me about 2 years to feel comfortable and content on the regular. But it's so worth it. And right now you can do tele-appointments which are usually cheaper and you don't have to go anywhere.\n\nI don't know your situation or if it's possible, but I do hope you find what works for you. I remember how hard it is to feel like your fighting your mind all the time.",

It allows you to stop relying on others for entertainment and fulfillment. \n\nI promise, there will be another woman for you. have patience and work on your own goals and aspirations and you will find that not only will you feel you need women less, but you'll probably have more of them interested.  \n\nAlso, take a look at what these cheating girlfriends have in common, personality/situation/attraction-wise, and see if you can nail down what makes these types of women attractive to you. Maybe change your \"type.\"\n\nNot everyone is a cheater. I'm sorry you're dealing with that.",

I'm not sure  if I'm afraid to be alone because I want to have a good marriage in the future and when I'm alone I just assume I'll never find a partner, or if it's because I'm just comfortable in a relationship vs being single. I'm 19 and I was in one relationship from 14-18 which was a really bad relationship and I got cheated on multiple times but I stayed in the relationship because I didn't want to be alone. After that ended, I was only on my own for about 2 months before this latest one began. Not having time to myself to cope with the pain of the last relationship really affected how I loved in the new one, because I couldn't love the girl as much as I wanted to. So I tried to break up with her, but I felt horrible for it and didn't want to lose her, so we stayed together. I was finally able to love her but she started talking to another guy, and that brought up issues from my past. I also was depressed because of things in my own life so it made it hard for me to want to \"fight\" over her love. That's what she wanted me to do, prove that I love her more than this dude liked her. But I wasn't about that, I remember thinking if shes going to do that she can just choose him because f*ck her for putting me in that position. And she did choose him, which I'm sure she'll regret later on because he is a loser, for lack of a better word. Anyway, not giving myself time to heal definitely wasn't a good thing, and since I haven't really been alone since I was 14, I think I really need this time to be comfortable with myself again. Also, there were definitely red flags in both relationships because they both had a boyfriend when I started talking to them and they didn't tell me, they broke up with them for me. So that's a big red flag, but I had feelings so I ignored it. Thank you for the advice and I will continue to better myself \u270c\ud83c\udffc",

The adult entertainment complex, regardless of the consumer, is globally changing people's relationships, self-esteem, integrity, and opinions of the opposite sex while encouraging sex trafficking in the process.  It is consumed at everyone's expense, but its influence on women is especially toxic. I know I sound like a prude, but I counsel people with sex and porn addiction and I've seen the fallout. \n\nThe goal of the porn industry is to addict as many people to it as possible and -- like the alcohol and tobacco industries -- it doesn't care who or what it ruins in the process. Don't let it take your self worth. \n\nCapitalism seeks to sell every female body type. Fat, thin, huge tits, small tits, blonde, brunette, short, tall, white, black, etc.... if it's a category of women, porn is absolutely commercializing it. Your boyfriend's \"taste\" in porn has **zero to do with you or your body** and everything to do with his chosen form of escapism and method of satisfying dopamine cravings. Each of these prompts, when over-used, can drive consumers to greater extremes of content, even things he's not really into. So don't confuse his use with your value, but do encourage him to investigate the harms of porn consumption with you. Then you can both better understand how it affects each of you.",

This has seemed to work for me, I hope someone else reading this may be able to benefit from it as well!",

I think like this often but if I don\u2019t hold tight the negative mindset can swoop back in like a landslide. It\u2019s kinda consumed me the last few years honestly aside from breaking barriers I never thought I could (quit drinking completely for 2 years strong now ,quit smoking cold turkey after 27 years of smoking for 3 years now) I\u2019m driven and wake up at 5am for years now and run 3 to 5 miles 5 days a week but all of this came from a common mindset that if I do better I will feel better. That is not the case. It is definitely all about the mindset of positive thinking and and the control of negative thoughts and scenario fantasizing. I needed to read this. Thank you. Best birthday gift ever",

I feel like I've gotten better at that, not stressing out as much aboyt current things, I still suck major balls but I'm at least a tiiny better. What I have no clue on how to improve upon, is that I have so many regrets, traumatic events that caused me to feel the way I do and missed opportunities, I could go on and on. I try not to dwell on them, but I end up doing it anyway and I just had this thought that kinda crushed me the other day.\n\n \"If I have so many regrets in life already, when I'm still so young, how can I ever hope to make up for all of them? It's time I'll never get back, countless options that I could have taken but didn't, my life could be so different right now. If I would have made the right choices, life would have gone my way. I could be blossoming with all of my potential on display. But no. Instead I chose this path. I ignorantly chose not to labour, pulled away at the slightest discomfort. I'm a loser and I have no value. This is all my fault. I hate myself for it. I don't want to aknowledge any of the things I accomplished or pushed through, because others have pushed through worse, remained funtional and determined and kind, so of course I'm inferior. I know I COULD have done things differently. I DID have the  strenght to push on and come out victorious. I'm just lazy and a loser.\"",

            "comment": "Might I suggest reading or finding audiobooks on the writings of the stoics and other philosophers. I've been taking in these writings the past week or so and it has given me a much better point of view and outlook on life. \n\nAnother thing I've been researching is emotional intelligence, something I wish I had learned about over a decade ago. This has helped me find that many of the problems in my recently ended relationship were due to me not being connected to my emotions and not expressing them in the correct way or not at all for the most part.\n\nI was left for another man a couple months ago and didn't actually find out until the week of my birthday last month. My job had become priority as I was trying to focus on that to get out of debt and secure a good future for our family. My connection to her was basically gone: lack of attraction, affection, intimacy, friendship, even, caused both of us to get further apart. Most of this year had been like this. I spent most of my home time playing video games and obsessing on social media scrolling I feel like to distract from her constant accusations that my late nights at work were just a lie and I was out cheating and the regular threat of how she will leave me soon if I don't change. Truth is I was using a certain dating app pretty regularly but all conversations dead-ended (even now that I'm single they do), I feel like I was just looking for some kind of gratification and didn't have the time or energy to actually follow through but if someone did want to go for it I doubt I would've said no and found a way to see them. Those accusations and threats just closed me up even more and I was so distant. She started talking to and hanging out with a coworker behind my back at the end of June and fell in love with him by the end of July. That started just 2 months after our baby boy was born so I'm wondering if it is just some tangent she is on from postpartum depression.\n\nOnce I found out almost 2 months after they started this, I felt so betrayed that I was working so hard for my family. I fell victim to anger and many arguments ensued that my rage could continue for days on end. Several times I would tell her if she is to be with someone else, that person will be who she lives with and not under my roof and a few times I took all her clothes outside but would bring them back in the next day when she saw and complained about me kicking her out. The last time I did that was the last straw for her and I regret ever taking it that far. She moved into a friend's garage and circumstances caused her bf to move out of his room and move in with her there. She convinced him to return his vehicle to the dealer and gave one of our cars to him. I feel like now that he moved in there, she will never be able to spend the night with our kids here. \n\nIt is true every time I over think about this crisis I get to a bad place. I get angry, slip up and act out without considering the outcome first, I just want what I feel to be imposed on her a thousand times fold when I go to that place. Every time I did this was during a time in which she was giving me a chance to turn things around. Jealously, anger, sadness and other negative emotions enveloped me instead of using them positively to revitalize the relationship. Every time I did it, it just pushed her more into her new relationship while I was under some fool's impression I was sabotaging it. I was only sabotaging myself and what I truly wanted. Don't do what I did unless you really want someone gone from your life.\n\nWe were together 12 years and that makes it all the more difficult to get past. If there even is getting past it. I feel like even though I've taken it so far, she still (maybe barely) holds on to giving me another chance even though it has become no simple task of falling out of love and making homeless her new bf if she were to choose me again. I have told her and we both agree that we at least need time apart before we can assess what our future may be. I need to actively change how I act before I commit to her again because if I can't emotionally connect with her, the same cycle will continue again. Those writings and researching emotional intelligence have helped drastically. My mind is already, in just over a week's time, feeling like it has more willpower to avoid running away to the negative. We haven't argued in over a week and it's like if I don't fan the flames the world doesn't burn down around me. I'm very proud of my ability to control my tongue now. I don't just want to hate her for what she's done, I understand it is just something out of my control. I can't blame myself for someone wanting to do what feels good for them.\n\nFarewell.",

I messed up forsure but I been constantly reassuring her plenty of times and now she believes no one has shown her shes worth the time and shes in a constant doubt shes a bother and feels bothered since I distanced myself I think I lost her trust but I want to help her she always states that I'm better off happy if she isnt in my life",

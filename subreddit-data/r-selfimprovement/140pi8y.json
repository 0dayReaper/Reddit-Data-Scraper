(The believe is I want to be a action taker.)\n\nI'm putting in systems to get stuff done, not using shit willpower.\n\nI need to stop watching twich now ugh problems in life I guess but I'll delete it from my bookmarks right now TBH, done it now nice. the believe I want is that I'm a action taker.\n\nI'm taking step to be charismatic which is nice to see in me.\n\nI'm rewording what I say that instead of saying \"I have to do this\" I say instead now \"I get to do this\" little change but the brain sees it completely differently.\n\nI have a big problem with spelling, and me posting these posts have helped out a lot with my spelling.\n\nI'm looking into my shadow I think its was shaped by toxic people and friends many at school and internet weirdly also ex-parters, my shadow is weird, I'm not sure how to put it into words.",

    "postText": "I am becoming very interested in the idea of being in balance and Taoist philosophy. That being said upon researching I\u2019ve come across some Chinese temples that look great \n\n* I have noticed that some look to be run by narcissistic masters that charge you double to experience their \u201ccharm\u201d. I dont want to deal with any masters, just with humble non self centered instructors. \n\nAny suggestions?",

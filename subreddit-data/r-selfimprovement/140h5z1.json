You decide to leave it be and head back to your tent to sleep, but the thought surely doesn't completely leave by then.\n\nIt seems like you have a good mindset that you focus on solving problems and mention them to others so they can be dealt with\n\nBut I think many people nowadays deal with a lot of problems in their head already. So while you mean well it could be overwhelming for some people\n\nI think it depends on what kind of problems they are. I would only mention problems that really have something to do with me or influence me, like when I live with someone and ask of them to help with the household.",

They don't want to hear it or face it.\n\nI am like you. I believe problem can be fixed. Everything is in the communication. Maybe try to turning your message the other way.",

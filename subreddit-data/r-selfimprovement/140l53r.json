    "postText": "I (21f) have always been a good student ever since i was a kid. I always got either the first or the second rank in the whole grade.i used to have lots of interests especially when it comes to learning about new things; i wouldn't really call them hobbies but i liked to read and be well informed about a different topic everyday.\n I thought this would continue in college, but omg i have not seen what's waiting for me . I'm currently  studying Medicine in university ( we study 7 years and I'm now on my 4th) and i basically keep failing. My grades almost never are anything higher than the passing grade . I can't study for long or even feel like I'm studying smartly like before. Back then i can remember what i studied and can revise it without even needing a textbook in front of me. But now i don't even feel like i studied anything after I finished the lecture. \nI noticed my attention span has became much much shorter, for i cannot physically sit down and read a book or an article anymore. \nFurthermore, the worst part of it is THE ABSENCE OF ANY SENSE OF URGENCY. It's literally driving me insane because i be literally having an exam after a few days but i sometimes find myself scrolling or sleeping. This is not me and it's driving me nuts and really really took a huge toll on my mental health and self-esteem.\nI know i have a lot of potential because i have seen it before, so i want it back, i want to be a good student, to learn new things and have some diversity in whatever knowledge i acquire.\nPlease anyone who's been here or know how i can get myself back together do not ignore. I'm in serious need of it. \nThank you in advance.\n(+ English is not my first language so don't roast me too much plz XD)",

            "comment": "I love this. Not cause it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s cause I\u2019m still fighting through the exact same thing right now. But please don\u2019t think you\u2019re failing. (Idk If you aren\u2019t already but) always treat your efforts/ trying your hardest at something as success, even without being able to see visible results, or improvement; you need to experience lows to reach highs. You said you loved learning new things and have the desire to be a good student, which are both things so many of us want, but not all of us will get, due to many lacking the mental strength it takes to get after it. But you seem like you want it hard enough, and that\u2019s good. Slowly but surely you\u2019ll find a way. It might take a long time, maybe a lot of grey hairs, but you\u2019ll get there if you keep at it. Apparently, procrastination and an absence of urgency happens as a result of subconscious doubt or fear, as a result of the potentially failing and what that could bring along with it. So try to explore what could be holding you back mentally through journaling. Writing stuff down really helps me clear my mind, helping me to understand how I actually feel towards certain things and why. Being such an extreme problem, it needs extreme solutions. Your focus is your only weapon. If unguarded, you\u2019ll so easily, lose track of the important things, and concern yourself with things that don\u2019t require your attention. My advice? Avoid shallow work tasks, like replying to Emails or making PowerPoints look pretty. Discard all social media, including YouTube. Make sure your using effective and active study techniques, like flashcards, blurting, the Feynman technique, or even learning with friends. Make sure your eating and living right (healthily)and getting enough sleep. Make sure your living space is clean. Make sure you have a clear cut routine, which limits your choice of activity or task when your supposed to be doing work. All of these suggestions will allow you to use less of your willpower when trying to take action towards your goals.  and despite it being hard sometimes, try to enjoy it. It seems horrible rn but you\u2019ll look back proud that you did your best\n\nI hope this helps.",

    "postText": "For context, i got out of a relationship that totally destroyed me, found out that i have BPD (which explains the unrealistic expectations and attachment i have for some people in my life) and its been over a year post breakup but i cant seem to be okay with myself. \nI\u2019m extremely insecured, i look fine on the outside but mostly empty on the inside, i cant trust others and i dont trust in myself either. If people i want to impress don\u2019t find me interesting it makes me feel like im useless. I hate everything about myself, no dreams, no hopes, just suicidal thoughts, tons of anxieties and self-hatred. I really want to be better, i tried to be better by changing my lifestyle but i always end up at where i was. Everyone around me is worried because im in my 20s but i\u2019m unemployed, mainly because my mental health has been really bad and the fact that i used to be someone that my parents were extremely proud of (doing excellent in school and all that) and now i cant even go out without feeling anxious is just nerve-wrecking.\nIf anyone has any advices that would mean a lot to me. I\u2019m sorry if i sound pathetic, i probably am but im trying my best :\u2019).",

Remember to take a breather and remind yourself that you are just enough. Sure there isn\u2019t anything atm in your life that\u2019s the end goal but you are not here to meet anyone\u2019s standard of accomplishment. Trust yourself with the small things first. Focus and perfect those and gradually give yourself more room to trust in your capabilities and tackle larger goals. Be careful not to become too comfortable with your coping mechanisms. It\u2019s always going to be easier to just stay home and not have to be anything to the world but it\u2019ll just become natural and soon you won\u2019t feel bad about being anything at all.  If you ever get that sudden burst to want to do something quickly just make yourself do any amount of it even if it\u2019s minuscule before eventually your brain tells you it\u2019s too much work. And lastly don\u2019t feel bad about feeling bad. You\u2019re not expected to be happy all the time nor suddenly feel better after a set amount of time. Cry often and cry loudly because you need to be able to release it from you. Thank you for opening up and I hope you get the peace you need.",

I guess life is too short to sit around and complain, sometimes when things are hard its unavoidable that we feel that way but when im doing a bit better i really dont want to live a wasteful life. I hope everything goes well in life for you!",

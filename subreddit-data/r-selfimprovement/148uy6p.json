    "postText": "I just can\u2019t believe my life right now. I want to go back some time to explain some of my relationships, financials, and physique\nRelationships\nWhen I was 16-18 I dated a girl and was heart broken over her for like 4 years. Like I didn\u2019t sleep with anyone or hook up or anything. Between low self esteem, no confidence in my looks, my social awkwardness, it just did not happen. That really broke my heart at the time that break up.\nAt 27 I dated a different girl. She was beautiful and we were together 5 years, 4 being really toxic. Like police called, cheating, constant verbal abuse, some physical abuse. Just bad stuff. But she fell in love with another dude way harder than she fell in love with me and I was so sad for like 8 months. Always thinking of her and her with the guy. It was torture.\n\nNow for my financials \nNever made decent money until I turned 21 and it was just delivering pizza. I was able to party more, never smart with it though. Didn\u2019t take trips or save up much or anything like that. At 25 money became easier because I started my career. But you get raises as the years go by and I didn\u2019t really start making good money until 30.\n\nPhysique\nI had a good body up until 27, then I drank a lot, ordered out a lot like pizza and burritos, and didn\u2019t exercise much. I hated that my face was fat and I had extra fat on my belly and stuff. Really messed with my self confidence and I never thought I looked good.\n\nSo now at 32 years old I made 130k last year and will be promoted within 2 years and make 150k base\nI slept with both of my exes with no feelings on my end, but they for sure want something with me. Idk why but it makes me feel good in a petty type of way because of how heart broken I was.\nAnd now I have the best body of my life. My face looks nice, cut and veiny arms, a box is forming around my core, I\u2019m fast and strong.\n\nThis was my day\nGot off work in the morning, smoked weed and surfing. It was a beautiful day at the beach, I saw like 12 dolphins. Then I smoked weed on the way back and fooled around with my ex from when I was 18. She made me bust 3 times in 2 hours. It was incredible. Then I smoked weed and skated.\nIf you ever told me at any point in my life that I would be feeling this great with relationships, money and my physique I never would\u2019ve believed it. I guess I\u2019m saying never give up but maybe you do have to go through some dark stuff to come out feeling like this and change your life ; but also you might go down another path. Don\u2019t. It\u2019s true what everyone says for life advice.\nEat fruit, veggies, good meat, grains, garbage food sometimes and you will feel great.\nLimit alcohol! Please please please, I used to drink probably 30 beers a week.\nEXERCISE, STICK TO IT! LOSING WEIGHT WONT MAKE SENSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOURE STARVING AND THE SCALE DOESNT MOVE BUT TRUST ME IT WILL!\nFind a workout you enjoy, not everyone has to be some crazy balls to the walls workout.\nBe a good person, that\u2019s all I got.",

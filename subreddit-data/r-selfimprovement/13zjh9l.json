    "postText": "i'm 24 and i haven't had a friend group since high school. i went through a major depression for 4 years. to this day, i haven't had a friend that i felt like myself with that cared as much as i did. i'll admit, i'm anxious and severely insecure. i made connections online that left me feeling empty due to me developing greater emotion and care than they do to me. i feel like at this point, i should be a loner. i tried bumble bff, lots of connection but after a couple days, things dwindled. i think the best option is meeting people in person. it feels like i'm dating for friends. i'd love to make deep meaningful friendships but how? i wonder if i do the things i enjoy doing, taking classes, going to the events and learning to feel comfortable and love myself that i'm going to attract friends, is that how it works?",

It's a hard thing to get but with consistency and seeing a person for lot of times, you will get one",

From what I understand, you're looking for strong and meaningful connections, but it takes time to make them.\n\nIn my opinion, having interests and hobbies in common is the basis for making real friends with whom you can really connect.",

    "postText": "Every single day I can\u2019t stay disciplined. I used to be that guy who would get up early to work, always wanting more. He\u2019s gone now.\n\nI think what started it is the very first time I missed a deadline on a project for work. I figured out I could just simply talk politely to the client to have it pushed back a day or two. Before then I was TERRIFIED of the consequences, until there were none.\n\nThis creeped into every aspect of my life. I would put off everything and make up a bullshit excuse to justify it. \u201cIt\u2019s Friday man, just chill, no need to do those extra reps, you\u2019ll make it up.\u201d \u201cI have to wash my car (I\u2019m a car hobbyist so this is also some bs) no need to do that important project\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a nightmare being self employed. Sometimes I wish I worked a trade job so I don\u2019t have a choice. So I don\u2019t have to worry about talking my self out of things because I literally can\u2019t. So I don\u2019t have to worry about watching my weight because it\u2019ll go down naturally doing hard labor. So everything will be simple and I won\u2019t have the weight of business management in my hands. \n\nIf you miss a day in my line of work you won\u2019t notice a thing, until it becomes a problem over months and it kills you down the line. If you don\u2019t show up at a real job you\u2019re fired immediately. Huge difference and it\u2019s ruining me because I don\u2019t see immediate consequences \n\nTLDR: I put stuff off because I don\u2019t see immediate consequences, fully knowing that I\u2019ll probably pay for it down the line, just telling myself that I don\u2019t know that for sure",

            "comment": "One way to address this is by creating your own system of accountability. Even if you don't see immediate consequences, you can set up personal consequences for yourself using a tool like the Forfeit app. By setting tasks and attaching consequences (like losing a small amount of money) for not completing them, you can create a sense of urgency and hold yourself accountable.\r  \n\r  \nAnother helpful strategy is breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. When you have a big project or goal, it can be overwhelming, leading to procrastination. By breaking it down into smaller tasks, you can focus on one step at a time and feel a sense of accomplishment along the way.\r Additionally, try to find intrinsic motivation by connecting with the deeper reasons why you want to be disciplined and productive. Reflect on the long-term impact and benefits of staying on track with your work and personal goals.",

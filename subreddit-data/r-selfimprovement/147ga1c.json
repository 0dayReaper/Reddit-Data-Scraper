    "postText": "So here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m intelligent, and attractive, but when I\u2019m talking to people my mind goes blank. I just can\u2019t start/hold conversations well, and feel like I have nothing to talk about. I feel like it\u2019s always the other person leading the conversation, and me just trying to keep up. Is there anything I can do to improve this? Are there some books I can read, or any exercises/training I can do? Lol. Sounds stupid maybe but I could use the help. I just need some advice, because I feel like I have a lot of unused potential, and I am an extroverted person who just can\u2019t be extroverted without being able to hold a conversation or especially lead the conversation. What can I do to strengthen this to the fullest degree?",

Additionally, participating in public speaking or improv classes can help boost your confidence and spontaneity in social interactions.",

The next step is reciprocating the energy or tone others bring to the conversation. \n\nAs for leading out the conversation, it might be overrated. I much prefer friends who can listen and bring a calming presence. Capybara friends are the absolute best.",

The internet is full of pictures where they are just chilling around (or on top of) capybaras. So it's just a friend with that kind of energy.",

Do you have any hobbies? How did you get into that hobby? Do you find it hard to maintain the hobby/set aside time for it? Do you meet many new people through your hobby? Etc and just keep asking questions, people love talking about themselves and they'll think you're a good listener and genuinely interested in what they have to say",

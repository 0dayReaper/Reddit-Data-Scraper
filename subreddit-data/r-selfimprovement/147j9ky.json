    "postText": "If you had to pick one time management technique that you find to be the most simple, helpful, and versatile, what would it be? \n\nFor me, it's **timeboxing**.\n\nI've always grappled with taking on too many tasks, distractions, and poor prioritization of tasks. Discovering and trying timeboxing was a relief. \n\nThe concept is simple: you block out a specific period in your calendar for a certain task. This \u2018timebox\u2019 is exclusively for that task, and once the timer is up, the task is done. It's like scheduling a meeting with your task and attending to nothing else during this period.\n\nThe benefits I experienced were amazing:\n\n* I began setting **mini-deadlines** that drove me into action (no procrastination!)\n* I started **focusing on one task at a time**, which drastically reduced errors in my work.\n* I began to **mindfully choose tasks** that fit into my time 'boxes' and said 'no\u2019 if I can't take up something.\n\nThe beauty of timeboxing lies in its **adaptability**. \n\nThere's 'hard timeboxing' where I finish an entire task, like assigning next month's blog posts to my team within a two-hour block. And there's 'soft timeboxing' where I complete a part of a larger project, such as dedicating an hour to competitor research, which is part of the broader task of creating a pitch deck.\n\nOne thing I've learned is that timeboxing is **not the same as time blocking**\u2014a common misunderstanding. Time blocking is a looser concept where you work on a part of a task without the intention to finish it within that block. In timeboxing, however, the goal is to wrap up the task within the set time.\n\nIf you want to try timeboxing, here's what worked for me:\n\n* I started by **manually allocating time blocks** for tasks in my calendar. It was a crude way to test the idea.\n* Later, **I tried Sunsama, a daily planner app** that allows you to schedule tasks, shows your realistic workload, and even features a \"Focus mode\" for distraction-free work.\n\nI'm curious\u2014what's your go-to time management technique? Has anyone else found timeboxing as helpful as I have?",

    "postText": "\"You are the average of your 5 closest friends.\"  \n\"Your friends should intimidate you slightly.\"\n\nI have friends who I grew up with but they moved 1000 miles away some years ago. They are smart, driven, motivate each other, entrepreneurs, gym goers, and have good Christian values. Absolutely one of kind people and changed my life! I still keep in touch with them.  I've now entered my 30s. I have a wife, house, family close by, a decent job... life is good and comfy. ...Too comfy. \n\nI need some friends that live closer to me, to push me, and make me better. Does anyone have any suggestions where I should begin looking within my community?  \nAre there places online that offer communities like this?",

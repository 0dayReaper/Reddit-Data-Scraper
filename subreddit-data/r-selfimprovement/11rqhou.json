All people want to be treated with dignity, no matter what they do for work, hobbies, their lifestyle, or what relationship type they have.\n\nThe issue is quite nuanced and needs a nuanced, intersectional take. The issues surround the criminal justice system, bodily autonomy, freedom of choice, slavery and trafficking, targeting of marginalized and underage people, worker exploitation and the need for workplace democracy, internalized misogyny, and how society is set up for and gives power to monogamy while often punishing non-monogamy.\n\nWhorephobia affects not just prostitutes or escorts, it affects strippers, burlesque performers, adult actors, workers at sex toy stores, erotica authors, drag queens, people in various forms of non-monogamous relationships, teens trying to navigate the Madonna/Whore dichotomy of societal double standard, the kink community, and sexual assault or harassment victims who are told they were \"asking for it\" because of how they look or act.\n\n \u2022 sorry this is late, my posts keep getting removed.\n\nEdit: not mad lol just come across that way sometimes because I'm very passionate and like to help out and educate people. \ud83d\udc95",

All people want to be treated with dignity, no matter what they do for work, hobbies, their lifestyle, or what relationship type they have.\n\nThe issue is quite nuanced and needs a nuanced, intersectional take. The issues surround the criminal justice system, bodily autonomy, freedom of choice, slavery and trafficking, targeting of marginalized and underage people, worker exploitation and the need for workplace democracy, internalized misogyny, and how society is set up for and gives power to monogamy while often punishing non-monogamy.\n\nWhorephobia affects not just prostitutes or escorts, it affects strippers, burlesque performers, adult actors, workers at sex toy stores, erotica authors, drag queens, people in various forms of non-monogamous relationships, teens trying to navigate the Madonna/Whore dichotomy of societal double standard, the kink community, and sexual assault or harassment victims who are told they were \"asking for it\" because of how they look or act.\n\n- sorry this is late, my posts keep getting removed.\n\nEdit: not mad lol just come across that way sometimes because I'm very passionate and like to help out and educate people. \ud83d\udc95",

A very big part of that is controlling anxiety so that one can regulate emotion properly. But these \"problems created by the mind/ 99% of our problems\"..they are not created out of anxiety and our inability to deal with it. \n\nIt does sound cool if we could just control our minds that  99% of these problems wouldn't be here.

Especially when you consider that worrying about the future / thinking about the past is such a common source of problem in our everyday lives.\n\nSay you're poor, and you're worried everyday about not being able to pay rent. It's something that is always on your mind and affects you very negatively. If you were able to not react yourself in such a way to not let the future affect your present so much, you could still perform the exact same actions you'd take normally, but 29 out of 30 days you'd be in peace. And then you either pay or don't pay rent. No need to increase our suffering everyday by worrying.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying I'm like that, but I have improved quite a lot in this aspect and I think it's the point OP is trying to make",

Hunting everyday is not a problem because it just is. Just like someone from the future saying \"how can you all sleep half your lives? Aren't you miserable\"? Well are you? No because it just is. Unhappiness comes from comparing and wanting different.\n\nEdit: what I'm saying is ignorance is bliss.

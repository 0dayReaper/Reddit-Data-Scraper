    "postText": "I\u2019m 22, and have a broad range of serious interests. Not hobbies, but genuine passions that I would like to dedicate at least 3-8 years of my life to. I\u2019m a studio art major right now, but I want to change it to something more applicable before I graduate. I just don\u2019t know what to choose! I\u2019m interested in studio art, general design, product design, engineering, writing, game design, music, physics, tech/AI ethics, philosophy, baking, biology(specifically GI science), sociology, homesteading/farming and wellness practices (which I believe will become more valuable as techies get more entrenched in their stressful careers lol). Some days I feel like I have way too many goals and I worry I\u2019ll spin out if I don\u2019t settle on something as my main focus. I just need some advice on how to choose a career that will be able to supplement the flexibility I need and still be highly lucrative (100k+ a year). \n\nIf it helps to know, my personal strengths are writing, creative planning, problem solving, design, people skills. I\u2019d say I\u2019m a very creative individual, but I have a STEM-type brain at times too if the project calls for it - I\u2019m just awful at math. I know I want to have multiple careers throughout my life (that\u2019s what living is all about - experience!!), and I plan to read all about the topics I end up not being able to study in a school setting, but I need a backup plan career that is broad and flexible enough that I can fall back on. I have financial security for now so I want to be careful about how I move forward with my studies and carefully choose a grad program as well. Any ideas..?",

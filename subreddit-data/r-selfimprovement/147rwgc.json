    "postText": "Thankfully this question is not asked because of any outburst or event etc. It's simply something I'd like some advice on from anyone that knows what works for them.\n\nI have gotten to the stage of awareness that I can identify where I know I'm in a bad mood, and can critically decide if it is justified or not (in previous fights with partner I have literally said \"I know my anger isn't justified, but I can't calm myself down\") this obviously gets me nowhere because I'm still angry. I can think about things critically in moments of calm, but obviously as I'm in an anger state, if I'm antagonised again while in that state, being angry is going to win.\n\nCan anyone give any tips of techniques they know to calm themselves while in a pressure situation?",

            "comment": "There's two ways I know of:\n\nDerail the thought train and hard exercise.\n\nFor hard exercise, I just do burpees.\n\nFor derailing the thought train, it's really a matter of being mindful and letting the angry thoughts just float on past. The moment you engage with it, you're building on it.\n\nIf you've been angry a lot in the past, it's possible your amygdala is hair-triggered.\n\nThe amygdala asks three questions:\n\n1. Do I hate this?\n2. Am I afraid of this?\n3. Will this hurt me?\n\nWith certain people, I get triggered easily by #1. I have literally gotten to the point with them where I hate certain behaviors and it puts me into fight mode (angry). By the time I figure it, I've already gotten aggressive with those around me.\n\nThe mindful technique I described above is what I'm practicing and it does help... but the problem isn't gone yet, either.\n\nI have no idea what the timeline is for solving it but I like to keep a metaphor in mind:\n\nRight now, I'm trying to escape the gravity of my own bullshit. I have no idea how much fuel I need, so the only option is to keep adding until I'm happily floating in orbit.\n\nMy options are keep going or crash back to Earth. How I feel about it doesn't matter, so I don't even entertain it.\n\nRather than focus solely on willpower, I have to become an expert in my outbursts - what was happening when the event occurred, what specifically triggered me, etc.\n\nOnce I have that awareness, I have to practice counter-balance skills - like mindfulness - until mindfulness is my default.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here's the irony: what I just wrote out is *not* something I'm consistently doing right now. I've been sucked back into the gravity of my bullshit, not because I'm incapable, but because I allowed the fuel supply to lapse.\n\nIME, if you have the path and you're still not doing it, it's because it's not as important to you as you think - at least not on an emotional level.\n\nSo another technique would be to 'visualize' how that aggression feels to the people who are on the receiving end. Bridge the empathy gap. Think about it even when it *is* painful. Put yourself in their shoes.\n\nThe only way out is through, brother. You've got this, and so I do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: one more tidbit:\n\nAnger is meant to get us in fighting mode. \n\nNow just imagine that this anger is actually a person who is actively trying to hurt your loved ones. That would make me very angry and want to fight.\n\nSo take all that amperage and use it as fuel to crush that opponent.\n\nAre you really going to let that guy take the wheel again? Are you going to let him walk away unscathed or *allow* him to maintain this level of power?\n\nMan, fuck that guy. Let's show him who's boss.",

Someone cuts you off in traffic (anger/normal).  You road rage them/break check/ get out of the car (reaction/ not normal)\n\nThis is easier to control if you think it out in advance (as emotions happen fast and the reason part of the brain jumps in the passenger seat)\n\nFigure out (when calm) what some (everyone is different) self soothing techniques you can use.  Deep breathing, counting, swearing, praying, talking \u2026 and be ready to do those things FIRST when you get angry.",

Something like that is very high-level spiritual work often only ascended masters are capable of properly pulling off\n\nThe universe smiles on those who are dedicating their lives to this and will actively help out",

            "comment": "Being aware is a big step and something you should be proud of.\n\nIf you have trouble not being baited into lashing out during an argument with your partner, the best thing you can do is walk away to focus on something else for at least 15 minutes that helps you both cool down and self-soothe. This can include things such as: walking, reading, listening to music etc.\n\nI say this because it's not physiologically possible to have a calm and productive conversation when we become emotionally flooded. Our body needs time to relax, so we can get back to that calm, observant wise mind and not feel so emotionally reactive about everything. Also, it's completely normal to feel that way. It happens to the best of us. It's easy for things to quickly go haywire when we keep trying to work out things in that sate.\n\nOnce you go back to talk with your partner after your body has had time to cool down, you'll be approaching the issue from a much calmer and clearer mind. You'll know the right things to say to de-escalate the situation. This has always worked for me. The trick is in sticking to it, because it can be tempting to not walk away when you really want to resolve things in the moment. But anything done from this approach will be counterproductive.\n\nIt's also important that you tell your partner before walking away that you need time to cool down and you'll return when you're in a better state to discuss it again. Most likely, they will understand.",

The brain will eventually realize the threat isn\u2019t real and the fight or flight feelings should calm down. Sometimes some 4 in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold breathing techniques can help further calm the feelings if you cannot think your way calmer",

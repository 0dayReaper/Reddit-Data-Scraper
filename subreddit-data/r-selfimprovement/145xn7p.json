    "postText": "Hello,\n\nCurrently experiencing a professional burnout at the age of 29, I have decided to pursue two passions that I have: Filmmaking and 2D animation. As I am just starting out in both fields, I know that it will take me years to reach a level where I can be paid for my work. The problem is, I don't want to choose one passion over the other, and I struggle to find a common foundation to practice daily in order to improve effectively in both areas. I feel a bit overwhelmed. How can I figure out which direction to take for my future work? How can I combine these two passions and make progress efficiently? Thank you.",

            "comment": "Since you're coming out of burnout, I'd encourage you to look at these passions through a lens of avoiding additional burnout in the future. Look up demand in both fields to see which one might be more secure/have more demand. Hyper competitive industries are more likely to ruin your passion because they grind you into dust. You could also look at the expected cost to enter both industries. Is one known to require tons of unpaid internship/expensive training/degree? Is one more friendly to an amateur portfolio to get your foot in the door? Do you have network contacts in either one which could lower the barrier to entry? Is one more geographically bound than the other, and are you already in (or do you want to move to) the place where jobs are?\n\nI'm not trying to overwhelm you, but a deep analysis like this might steer you towards a sustainable path with less of the pain you're feeling now. If there's no clear winner after this analysis, please feel comfortable with jumping into one at random and just put in the time and see how you feel. It's totally okay to change your mind later, but it there's no clear preference right now that means you need more data. Spending time on one or the other will give you that data and a clear decision will be easier. Trial and error is the only way to learn this sometimes, and that's okay. Wishing you all the best!",

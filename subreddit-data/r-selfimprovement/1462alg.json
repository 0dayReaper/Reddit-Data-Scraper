I can't afford real therapy currently because of financial reasons.\n\ni think i might be dealing with some kind of depression which makes me very lazy and have low self. it makes me experience severe jealousy problems especially about my girlfriend. i don't want to be that way anymore. also, i always overthink and stuff.\n\nso for those who have luck with self-help, how did you do it? do you have any recommendations?",

It's also okay to have some days off, the important thing is to be back as soon as possible.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the stress and anxiety comes from thinking about past experiences, where you relive the pain, or future that you start imagining even though there is a big chance it won't happen like you imagine. The best think against this is to try to focus on current moment. You can practice this by trying any type of meditation, and you can read more about this stuff like in book Awareness (this one opened my eyes completely).\n\nBecause you don't have the option to go to therapy, I would advise you to start journaling your emotional state day by day. This can be helpful to analyse your mood swings, and try to figure out what previous experience are causing them.\n\nOverall, if I were you, I would try investigating more about meditation and journaling, and I would try implementing them in my life.",

    "postText": "I (M18) am in a relationship (F18) and have been for almost a year. Throughout the relationship, I've been struggling accepting it for what it is. It's fulfilling and makes me happy on most days, but sometimes I am filled with emptiness and logning for the emotional highs a toxic relationship can give. I used to see this other girl (F17) who I absolutely fell for right from the start, something I have yet to feel for my girlfriend, who I love. I recently saw this other girl at a party and it triggered so many emotions. I feel so alone and empty. I know that being with her would not make me happy in the long run, as she has trouble committing and would ignore me for days at a time. Very manipulative. Being with my girlfriend is the complete opposite, totally respectfull and emotionally supportive. This is what I want, but it clearly isn't working. I have not reached the levels of happiness as I did before committing to that relationship, but I still love her and want to be happy with her. Should I just wait until something finally clicks in my brain or should I act? If so, what do I do?",

Break up, you aren\u2019t in a place where you can give her what she really needs if you are longing for something unhealthy. Break up and work on yourself and focus solely on your work and or studies for the future. As well as focus on whatever trauma you have try therapy. Please don\u2019t have her tag along wasting her time while you try to get yourself together.",

            "comment": "19M here. I feel you for this my man. Last year I left a very long, toxic relationship with a girl I met back in school. Me and her kept breaking up and getting back together over almost three years, and could not go two weeks without a huge fight. The extreme shifts of our overall moods were that of epic calibre. For example, one day we would start fighting about something very little that would degenerate into a day, sometimes week-long argument, full of tears, yelling and gaslighting on both parts. The fights would sometimes go on for so long that we would entirely shift from one topic of discussion into another without even noticing it. This entire mess would often lead to us becoming extremely tired, putting our differences aside, stop fighting and have the best make-up sex of our lives, rounds and rounds again in one night. The madness would continue on with a massive session of lazing around and consuming an enormous amount of dopamine together (vaping, more sex, overstimulating video games on one screen with another screen playing an overstimulating tv show, etc). Everything aforementioned plus the fact that we were each others first for everything has definitely completely fucked with my perception on the meaning of a relationship and how it should feel - I thought all of that was normal and something couples just do; its not.\n\n  \nLast year, when me and this girl finally broke up for good, I went on a massive period of \"whoring around\" (hooking up with different girls, lots of casual sex, etc) And although such kind of lifestyle suits some people and it sure is fun, I felt completely empty at the end of the day, I wanted something fulfilling and that just was not for me. So much so that I turned down probably the hottest chick I've ever seen in my life after a solid month of casual sex with her because she wasn't interested in committing, she just wanted to hook up every now and then. Everything felt confusing, I knew nothing, I didn't know right from wrong, I had forgotten who I was and my values.\n\n  \nI realised earlier this year that I had too many expectations to a relationship and I was basing it all off of previous relationships and casual hook ups. I somehow had allowed all the girls I was with before to mess with what I thought a good relationship was; so obviously nothing good could come from that, they were all either freaks, cheating on their boyfriends with me, yelling and shouting at me, taking their sadness out on me, Just a mess in general. After having this epiphany I realised I knew nothing at all, and I just hoped that which ever girl I hooked up with next knew something about something and could maybe guide me to and extent. (This could have ended terribly but I got lucky. Come to think of it I legit was asking for a girl to \"fix me\"). Anyway, it happened. I met this very cool girl and we started dating. We have not fought once and we really get along. We see each other all the time, and although its not as exhilarating as dating that one girl from before, or hoeing around at clubs going back to girls' house to fuck them and leave after a big night out, or having casual sex with Mrs-I-Forgot-Your-Last-Name, it is much more fulfilling. Think of it like this: If you were feeling sad about being lazy, you could go to the gym and you'd come home a little happier, sleep better and not feel as lazy tomorrow; or, you could have a couple of drinks and smoke some cigarettes to forget about why you are sad. Both will take your mind out of it, but one is more sustainable.\n\n  \nSo I understand where you are coming from. I have said enough so I'll sum it up here:\n\n  \n1. If you think your toxic relationship is all that you've know about love, do not base your expectations for relationships on it.   \n2. The manic cycle of the toxicity and degeneracy can be very fun, but end that cycle before it ends you.  \n3. If you are lucky enough to be with a girl that loves you and gets along with you and does not torment your life, let her take the wheel every-now-and-then. You do not have to always be in control.   \n4. Choose nurturing and sustainable habits and relations over short releases of dopamine. You will live better. \n\n  \nGood luck brother. I believe in you. Man to man.  \nP.S. Don't push the people who mean you well away from you.",

I know that this girl is good for me and means well, but I just can't get rid of thoughts of the toxic girl. Do you think I should be alone for a while and work on myself first? This girl I'm with is literally everything one could dream of, I'm afraid of regretting leaving her. But something has to change. Again, thank you and congratulations on all your progress.",

                            "comment": "What worked for me was that I simply went into the new relationship with no expectations and just did what felt right. To put it simple I tried not to think about all the craziness of the past and allowed myself to go with the flow. What really helped was that my current girlfriend guides me through a lot of things. Whenever I feel a little out of control and start having all those negative thoughts, reminiscing of the past, I would take myself out of the situation and let her kind of take care of me mentally. You should try it, who knows. Maybe your girl is better off mentally than you to begin with. Anyway, she totally understands that I can shut off sometimes and lose all social battery so she helps me out by giving me my space or just making me a coffee and sitting with me watching something on the telly. Just let her take care of you every now and then, that probably helps the most. I obviously also take care of her too as much as I can. Try it, let her look after you when you regress. \n\nBottom line is don't leave your current girlfriend; and whenever you get these thoughts about the toxic girl, try to open up about it to your current girlfriend. **Always let her help you**, that is very important. The 'change' you are looking for will not seem obvious and be so clear to you, but you can start by reflecting on how your life has changed since you met your current girlfriend; you and I are very lucky to be with our current girlfriends. Some people are still stuck in a toxic relationship and wish they had what we have now. \n\nBest of luck my friend this was honestly lovely to write, I almost needed to write it; its the first time I've put this particular experience into words.",

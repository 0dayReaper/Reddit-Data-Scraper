Meditating. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I learned what it actually did that I began to meditate consistently. \n\nI thought meditation was a completely bullshit fad hippies did that had no tangible benefits I cared about. \n\nMeditation is literally one of the first 3 things I do in the morning now. \n\nThe reason I hated it was because,\n\nA.I felt like I was bad at it. \nB. I never felt any results. \n\nHere\u2019s how I fixed those two and started living it. \n\n1. To be good at meditation, start with 2 minutes a day for 14 days. \n\nThis will help you get confident in your ability to focus for that long, then after that you can go up to 5 minutes where I personally started seeing benefits. \n\n2. How to start seeing benefits. \n\nThe #1 issue I had was I wasn\u2019t practicing it long enough for them to kick in. \n\nMeditation is like an antidepressant, you need to do it for 30 days before you start feeling it working. \n\nIt\u2019s main benefit? \n\nYou will get cravings for things you know undermine your goals. \nInstead of immediately folding to them though\u2026you\u2019ll acknowledge the desires. Ignore them. \n\nThen keep pursuing your goal. \n\nIf achieving all of your goals in life is worth 10 minutes of your time. \n\nTry meditating for 30 days, you won\u2019t regret it.\n\nHow I meditate:\n\nSet timer for 2 minutes. \n\nFocus on your breathing as long as possible. As you begin to follow thoughts come back to your breathing without yelling at yourself. \n\nEach time you follow one thought then return.\n\nIt\u2019s one rep mentally. \n\nDon\u2019t feel bad if you have trouble at first, as you get more reps you get better and better.\n\nOvertime you learn to view your thoughts but no longer follow them, giving you complete impulse control.",

You bring your mind back to just thinking about the one thing when your mind starts to wander, that is the exercise of controlling your thoughts so you can have a clearer mind and learn how to stop thinking about negative things for example.\n\nYou can focus on what your body is really feeling, what you're smelling or hearing, which is also called grounding. I believe grounding is a type of meditation and it especially helps with anxiety or stress.",

                            "comment": "I have to kindly disagree, focusing on one thing at a time is just what we do 24/7. (Mindfulness) meditation is more like being keenly aware of what you're focusing on, and doing exactly that but not more. Not grasping at what shows up in consciousness, just noticing it.\n\nAnd typically one would begin one's meditation sessions with deciding to focus on the breath, and then observe what happens every time we get distracted from that process. Typically, shortly our mind will start to wander, going \"damn that hair cut was expensive. What does it cost to run a hair salon anyway? Traffic was also bad today. I hate traffic. But man the music in the car was nice. Oh shit I'm thinking about stuff now. Stop thinking\" and then we're back to our breath.\n\nAnd this is a key moment. The mind wandered. But it took x seconds to notice it. Noticing it is the key part, and it's funnily enough where people get frustrated at themselves. It's the equivalent of holding a dumbell in your arm for a minute, then you're like \"oh shit I'm supposed to lift this thing! God damn it!\" Then you throw it away and cancel your gym membership.\n\nAfter a while of doing this, certain patterns begin to emerge. One will become intimately aware of the nature of their mind while meditating. We start noticing that when we're stressed out or angry, that focus is going to jump much more frequently to our inner voice, and it'll just be repeating the same stressed/angry thoughts again and again.\n\nAnd here again is a key moment. We're not to grasp at those angry thoughts, or push them away, but simply notice them, and return to the breath (or sound, or feeling of wind, or any sensory input we happen to notice). Our usual automatic state of mind however, would keep the angry inner monologue going for minutes, hours or even days. Not aware (mindful) of this infinite loop, we'd just agree that we have every right to be angry, and keep telling ourselves that.\n\nAfter some time of this pattern, one notices that their focus jumps less and less to the anger they had 5 minutes ago. Suddenly different thoughts emerge. Thoughts of compassion, relief, how we're going to apologize to the person we just insulted, and thoughts of how silly it was to react so explosively.\n\nThis is where the power of meditation lies, because we become aware of the fact that we don't decide what we're going to think next. Thoughts just emerge, seemingly randomly. We're just here to notice them, but until we begin to meditate we think we're the author. With mindfulness, we lose that relationship to thoughts, and begin to see that we're no more authors of our thoughts than we're the authors of what anyone else says. And if this sounds like voodoo hippie dippie bs, I encourage you to test this hypothesis by meditating.\n\nSo suddenly we have a tool for living in the presence, more fully. A tool to embrace, accept (and watch dissipate) negative mindsets like anger. We have a tool for relaxation, self acceptance, focus and discipline. A tool for being content with what we have and what we are. A tool for reacting to difficult situations in the world.\nAnd with the anger example, I can personally say that, hands down, reducing my anger to 10% of what it used be has been immensely valuable to improving my quality of life.\n\nBut all of this comes from actually practicing meditation frequently, so that this state of mindfulness become automatic and ingrained in our habits.\n\nMost of what I wrote I've learned from Sam Harris' many talks and using his app Waking Up. I'd highly recommend a free trial and checking out the introductory course where he teaches these methods and concepts in a ridiculously succinct manner for anyone interested. Good luck",

                    "comment": "&gt;Are there any guided meditations for beginners you recommend? If not, how do you suggest starting?\n\nThere are four major players in the meditation apps space: Calm, Headspace, Ten Percent Happier, and Waking Up.   \nI have personally used each of these to a significant degree. For those of you who haven\u2019t, here\u2019s a quick recap of each:  \nCalm - Calm is mainly positioned as a tool to help with reducing stress and optimizing sleep. Their main allure is the sheer amount of celebrity guided meditations they offer. Calm isn\u2019t strictly about meditating. It is oriented towards giving tools that help with stress (white noise, sleep stories, etc), and empowers the user to explore whichever tool resonates with them.   \nHeadspace - Headspace is a well known mindfulness and mediation app built by Andy Puddicombe who was inspired by his journey to the Himalayas to study meditation. The app has a very fun, coherent aesthetic and offers a wide variety of content. Curation and delivery of meditation is its strength. Diving deeper into the practice seems less emphasized, perhaps because the app is trying to appeal to everyone.    \nTen Percent Happier - Ten Percent Happier begins to scratch the surface on going beyond simple de-stressing. Dan Harris, the founder of Ten Percent Happier, started a meditation practice after having an on-air panic attack as a journalist in the early 2000s. The app promotes not only meditations and mindfulness activities, but also talks and videos that support the user\u2019s journey in reframing their perception of reality.   \nWaking Up - With Sam Harris\u2019 Waking Up there is certainly a deep emphasis on meditation, but its clear that selflessness and reshaping one\u2019s mind is also a core purpose of the app. In addition, there is a depth of quality talks that are above and beyond other value propositions. Finally, 10% of money Waking Up makes goes to charity. As far as I can tell, this is not something any of the other competitors do.    \nAccording to Sensor Tower, Waking Up is by far the best at retaining its users. Looking at Day 90 retention, which is the percentage of users who come back to the app 90 days after first trying it, we see that Calm retains nearly 2% of users, Headspace nearly 3% of users, and Ten Percent Happier nearly 3.5% of users. Meanwhile, Waking Up is at nearly 6%. This means that Waking Up retains users at a 2-3X rate of it\u2019s competitors. This is a huge delta. Retention is strong proxy for user satisfaction, as no one engages with a product that they do not enjoy nor get value from. Waking Up is doing something different.   \nWhy is Waking Up retaining better?  \nWaking Up appears to be the most powerful laser beam mindfulness learning tool on the market. Why is that? This is where we have to venture into subjective-land. A land of hypotheses rather than finite conclusions.   \nHere are a few hypotheses as to why Waking Up retains its users better than its competitors:   \nMore Depth, Less Repetitive - There\u2019s a sheer volume and variety of content that doesn\u2019t exist elsewhere. This includes talks, conversations, and exercises by Sam but also other great teachers, including over 100 from Alan Watts alone. There\u2019s various meditation and mindfulness styles to explore from a multitude of teachers.  \nSuperior Onboarding - The onboarding progressively teaches you different ways of thinking about yourself and the world. The first 30 days is basically a course, and I would say, subjectively, that it has immense value in and of itself. I\u2019ve repeated Waking Up\u2019s onboarding 3 times now.  \nCommunity Feeling - They do novel, engaging things to foster community. One example is Waking Up\u2019s \"100 days of giving\" where they commit to giving away a million dollars to charity and the way they're distributing it is by randomly selecting one user each day to choose a charity (from a pre-approved list) to receive $10,000. Having a sense of community is a strong driver of long term retention.   \nDeeper Spiritual &amp; Intellectual Tinge - Sam is promoting a different relationship with reality that has a more spiritual and intellectual bend. The other apps seem more about relaxing than about having a deeper experience. Waking Up is more concerned with guiding you toward the \"truth\" of experience. In a way, it treats the user much more like an adult seeking ongoing development. Additionally, I believe Sam\u2019s approach helps our intellectual minds wrap around the mechanics of meditating and mindfulness in a way that other apps don\u2019t. This can be key to establishing a meditation habit.   \nEastern Approach - Calm and Headspace align more with the western take on mindfulness as a tool for destressing and achieving a more peaceful less reactive mental state. Waking Up is a lot closer to the source of this practice which finds its roots in Eastern traditions, particularly some Buddhist schools of thought but not exclusively. It\u2019s more about self-inquiry and exploring the true nature of being. Waking up puts a lot more emphasis on the philosophy behind things, Sam is a big proponent that meditation isn't just a tool for stress relief of anxiety reduction but a means of deep insight.  \nMeditation is a very personal experience so it\u2019s hard to say which of these offerings will resonate with you. If you some of these thoughts and insights resonate with you, I would suggest trying Waking Up.\n\nNote: This is a snippet of an article I've been working on, catered to your question, in case anyone was interested.",

    "postText": "I ruined my 20s by actually thinking prioritizing school was the top priority and that eventually relationships could naturally follow if I tried. What an absolute mistake. \n\nI can\u2019t end it because my parents would be sad for a bit. The only possible bright spot in my life is that I graduated w my doctorate last month and I\u2019m starting a really cool work form home job next month. \n\nI ruined my life tho. I\u2019m a 25 M virgin who has weight struggles despite trying. I want to date more than anything and a chance to show a girl a good time. None of the dating apps work, cause looks come first on there and I\u2019m brown, fat and 5\u20197. I always am the one making plans w my friends too, and they always cancel last minute to spend time w other friends or their gfs.\n\nNOW: I just want a life reset. \n\nStarting next week, I wanna make a even harder gym routine and be strict about every calorie, if I can\u2019t count it I vomit it.\nI want to find new friends even though as a male after college and at a work from home job, it will be impossible, no clue where to start. I want to go to therapy and a dietician once I get paid. I want to get one girl\u2019s number before I die. \n\nAny help w any of my reset things is appreciated? It\u2019s this or suicide.\n\nEdit: wow this blew up thank you everyone I\u2019m still reading everything!\nEdit 2: I love you all so much, im still reading",

It sounds like you\u2019re putting a lot of pressure on yourself.  \n\nStarting a new job is going to be stressful - even if it\u2019s a great job, new jobs are stressy.  \n\nIf you\u2019re already going to the gym, you could think about adding some time there.  You can drink more water.  Eat more fresh food. \n\nBe kind to yourself. And I really applaud you for getting off to therapy. It\u2019s the best thing I ever did for myself.",

Your mental framework seems almost intentionally constructed to be self-sabotaging in its sheer negativity.\n\nThis, might, save you though.\n\nThat negativity that underlies your beliefs is not as invisible as you might think. People can see right through you to it, and it is not attractive. Gratitude for what you have (instead of a focus on what you want, don't have, and why you think that is) can de-fuse that negativity completely though. If you let it.\n\nI'm glad you have a PhD, because now I can properly yell at you for how unbelievably stupid it is to think you know the causes of your troubles without a sound, scientific basis for your beliefs. It is a very good thing that you are smart enough to potentially be able to understand the problematic nature of trying to do that.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, I'd like to remind you that everyone's goal is to find a good, successful mate that will help them achieve their own goals in life. Cutting some weight will absolutely help with this, as you'll appear to most people as more fun in bed, which is something many people want. But as you get older, you'll find your peers get wiser from their own life experience, and people will start to look for more and more complex packages in their dating partners. *This* is when the PhD and corresponding pay will start to pay serious dating dividends. You're almost there, you're out of the shallow 20somethings. Don't lose focus.\n\nCut that weight. Focus on gratitude. Smile more, even if you have to force it. (look up the latest literature on the potential benefits of that last one if you don't believe me) Make sure your own standards are not sky-high, and that a real life, flawed, human girl will be able to meet them.\n\nYou're not \"out\" yet, and life is long and complex. Good luck.",

It's unusual, but it'll stop being a black mark once people grow up a little bit and stop using the social norms of pop culture to determine their values, and start leaning a little more on their own experience and clear, rational deductions based from that experience.\n\nNot everyone will be rational of course, but the percentage of people that are will steadily increase from its current extremely low rate as everyone acquires more experience.\n\nIf it really, deeply bugs you, put your own rationality hat on, fly to Nevada and hire a clean, legal prostitute. You'd find you don't gain very much, and thus your current virginity was probably not costing you very much either, except in the confidence department. Which is, admittedly, very important.\n\nUp to you really. You could wait for a date to pop your cherry, but then you'll have to wait for that with this thing in the back of your mind nagging you the whole time and eroding your sense of self-value.",

Talking from experience \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It could be a positive attribute if you play it right, and might not be an issue if you choose not to bring it up. Main point is, the other person should like you in general so that they want to take things further with you.

About weight, with changing little and right things, you would feel a big change in some weeks. It would work.\n\nMake a vision board or a page you plan it on. Think about where you want to see yourself, what you want to achieve. Ask yourself: Where and how do I want to be in six months? A year? Envision, put healthy goals, make planning into a fun, hopeful process. Put in extra time for slip ups and failures. Everyone slips up, everyone fails from time to time. That way, your plan will be realistic, and it will have a big chance of working.",

You need to make incremental, reasonable, manageable changes. If you\u2019re fat, that\u2019s okay, you can change. But make the change gradually, you will have a much better shot at success.\n\nThe easiest way to lose weight, is to literally eat less. Intermittent fasting. You don\u2019t need to change what you eat, you don\u2019t need new recipes, you don\u2019t need any major plans. All you need to do, to start off is tell yourself that you will only consume food during a certain window throughout the day. Don\u2019t eat _more_ during that window than you would normally to compensate either. Also, stop drinking anything sugary. Just drink water.\n\nAs for working out. You can literally start with a Bodyweight routine at home or with a couple dumbbells. Remember to stretch lots and high intensity interval training (HIIT) can be done with no real equipment at home but it\u2019s quite effective, especially starting off.\n\nDoing HIIT and intermittent fasting will be very manageable starting off. You won\u2019t feel overwhelmed and you\u2019ll begin to gain a little confidence. You can make changes and do more as time goes on.\n\nListen brother. Nobody cares that you\u2019re a virgin. Nobody honestly gives a shit. You shouldn\u2019t determine your self worth based on whether or not you\u2019ve had sex. To be truly confident, you gotta dig deep for that. It sounds like a cliche but that comes from within. Every human has the potential to be something great and that potential isn\u2019t given to you from somebody else. I\u2019m telling you now, things will get better, you\u2019ll start looking better and you\u2019ll start feeling better. You\u2019ll realize that when you take pride in your body, it gives you a huge confidence boost and that will show in other aspects of your life. I\u2019ve felt the effects of working out, first hand. I\u2019ve been working out for years and I look back at old photos and I\u2019m so grateful I started all those years ago.\n\nChange takes time man. It takes a lot of time. Again, at the risk of sounding cliche: hard work and patience truly will pay off for you.\n\nMessage me if you have any questions or you need to talk, brother.",

Once I even liked a dude who was shorter than me. Just get rid of this victim mindset and start building confidence. Practice self grooming. Eat well. Set goals. Work to your goals. Have hobbies. Be an interesting person and the right people will look past any other flaws. You\u2019re doing yourself no favours by making this harder on yourself",

Well I haven\u2019t had sex. Or you can not say anything and dive right in and hope for the best. Ask her what she likes. Watch some instructional porn made by women to see what we actually like.

Work on losing weight to be healthy. And being a 25 year old virgin is not necessarily a turn off. However, if you focus on that instead of on getting to know a woman, it will become one. It is pretty easy to sense when a man just wants to get in your pants for his own sake than to actually build a relationship with you. So don\u2019t focus on being a virgin. Focus on getting to know people. Show interest in them. Listen. Be kind and considerate, to yourself as much as to others. If you can\u2019t be gentle with yourself, it is only a matter of time before you are unkind to others too. Give yourself time, and grace! You just did something amazing by completing a PhD. That proves you can do hard things. But you did not get that degree in a day, or even in a year. You can make changes, but you don\u2019t have to be at the end of all your goals to find happiness or a relationship. Being on the journey is good enough.",

Weight can easily become a serious compulsion. I have a son who is probably close to your age who has a similar drive to do well in school and it's easy to drive yourself crazy, focusing on perfection.\n\nI'm glad you recognize suicide isn't the way. I know how tempting it can be, but after my brother's, I always notice all the things he missed in life and the things he thought would never change actually DID change within a couple years of his death. \nEverything in life always FEELS so fixed, but that's just a feeling. Everything is always changing. \nYou've got a great attitude towards the future! It doesn't have to be a whole ass life reset, in my experience,  thinking like that set me up for failure. It's REALLY IMPORTANT to work towards small goals and recognize your successes along the way. Like, your whole educational success and career trajectory are something most people would be jealous of. You're killing it in life and you aren't even noticing.\n\nFind hobbies, go to classes and groups related to your hobbies. Just GO to places where other people will be. Volunteer. You really have to accept yourself as you are. \nI love that you are planning for therapy. There are a million things you can do today to help change your life, but they are all going to involve changing how you see yourself. You are at a GREAT starting off point in life.",

I'm going to be blunt, because this is something too many wannabe self improvement people do:\n\nyour problem, shown from before, is that you seem to lack moderation &amp; impulse control and just act in binary ways.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s this or suicide. &lt;-- (the lack of self awareness is crazy)\n\nstop going to extremes as you did before your early 20s only prioritizing schooling and putting 0% elsewhere. extremes that you can't sustain that do you no real good long term as you should have learned from both those early 20s and your weight issues. People love to hop on an extreme strict uneducated diet of chicken breast and veggies for 3 weeks then give up forever, meanwhile bodybuilders are eating whatever they want in moderation 24/7 and in precise control of their weight. There's also some guy in here who posts about purposefully having \"no fun\" for 3 months to fix his life - its stupid\n\nUse your head to actually learn about things like the gym &amp; weight loss rather than being a human magpie that just likes the shiny new extreme you found to hyper-fixate on for a while until you inevitably drop it continually repeating this cycle. Learn to moderate and manage the things you want for yourself like the gym and a diet, realize that these things are deadly easy if you just spend some time being dedicated to learning about it properly rather than just impulsively thinking youre super serious this time. If you can't do that you don't want it enough and you should stop. You need to dedicate some of your time and brain space to these things if you want it just like schooling.\n\nYou also need to moderate where you spend your time as well clearly for your goals but you seem like you're on the right track with that. Also green light for therapy, good idea\n\nalso \n\n&gt;I\u2019m brown\n\nI'm brown too, your point? I have a lot of success from dating apps, this is a really odd thing to say. Almost every time someone here posts something like this they unintentionally drop a crumb of why they might be unemployed/unsuccessful with women/fat/lazy etc. Maybe take a look at that while you're at it",

As a female East Asian, I obviously haven't had the same experiences as you or OP and location might play a factor as well (I'm in Canada), but I wonder if you might be giving too much credence to the idea that being brown is hindering your sex life.  I understand that Western media portrayals have not been kind to either of our races, but I also say this as someone whose first boyfriend was brown (Indian/African and Muslim) and who was \"teased\" for having so many crushes on brown guys in university. (\"Teased\" as in 'hey, let's go sit next/talk to your brown boys' - not in any disparaging/judgmental way.)\n\nYou're right that sex in the media is pervasive - it sells so easily that it seems \"normal\" to think \"everyone is having it so why not me?\" On the other hand, I think there are a ton of reasons why people might be virgins at whatever age you are (e.g. religion, values, being asexual, the current politics around abortion access in the US).  I'm not sure whether it's due to my gender/background/type of friends I have, but sex has essentially never come up as a topic of discussion other than maybe to answer the question of \"did or didn't you?\"... so I guess I don't really know what you mean by having to relate to other people when it comes to their sexual experiences.  That being said, if/when the topic comes up, maybe instead of trying to actively contribute to the conversation, you can try to shift your focus to just listening and learning from your friends' experiences (or being supportive, I suppose, if things have gone badly.)  I know you said you don't know anything about sex, but keep in mind that just because someone has had it doesn't mean that they know what they're doing or that they're doing it well :)\n\nI (obviously, again) don't know you or what kind of experience you want, but from your post it seems like you might be looking more for relationships rather than hook-ups.  If my assumption is correct, I would say that as lonely and as frustrating as it can be, it might be better to wait and be patient than to rush into experiences just for the sake of having them.  Most of my friends ended up marrying their first boyfriend/partner and I feel like the odd one out having had multiple relationships, and to be honest I Jumped into many of them because I was worried about being forever alone.  If I could though, I would have liked to erase everything in between my first and my current boyfriend, but I can't. Such is life :)\n\nAnyway, tl;dr: being brown =/= being undesirable; losing your v-card is not the end-all, be-all.",

You are so young and have much to live for. 20s is barely the beginning, forgive yourself. I also feel I wasted much of my time in my 20s, but it's also made me who I am today, who I like to think has improved. \n\nSex is not going to provide the deep connections many in this world seek, so I suggest avoid focusing on that. Also, do not blame race or height, I know many people in interracial relationships, you can find them on social media. Although I would suggest to focus more seeing others as people rather than visual appearance or culture. However, what is FAR more important is understanding who they are people. What are their values? How do they react in various situations? Is this someone YOU would enjoy being around? Do you make each other better? This applies to friends or romantic partners. \n\nFinding yourself can feel like a lonely process at times, but it will be worth it to live your life authentically. Start to follow positive role models on social media which will help you. Avoid toxic forums that make you feel worse. Find things you enjoy that fulfill you. By this, I mean, often things that take some work but give you a sense of purpose and are rewarding. It could be working out at the gym, making friends there and having a sense of community; or maybe it's doing something at your cool new job; maybe it's being aware of your friends and what they're going through, and being the person who asks if they're OK. You are clearly an intelligent person, who has much potential to live a great life, however you see fit. I hope you will do an update to this post one day and let us know how you are :)",

However, approaching self improvement in the fashion you are will do, if at all.\n\nIf you want to achieve these goals you HAVE to set yourself up to be able to consistently do this shit every single day, you gotta start small so you\u2019ll actually be able to do it daily. rome wasnt built in a day, no ripped guy with insane daily routines just started off that way, and neither will your dream future self. once you get used to each baby step, you can add another baby step, and build your dream that way. \n\nive been in your current mindset so many times in the past, and it never ever ever worked out because its just far too hard and straight up unrealistic to maintain. think of it like trying to climb a mountain by trying to scale the vertical cliff, instead of walking up the hill because it starts so much further away. yeah its true that distance wise, just scaling the cliff would seem the most efficient / best route to take, but its just short sighted because youll never make it that far before you lose your grip and fall.\n\nprogressive overload, baby steps, always. remember that, and trust in it.

            "comment": "Hey man, I can understand what you're going through. Congrats on your doctorate as well! This one will be a long answer, BTW. \n\nYour situation was something I was going through about 2-3 years ago, and I'm still trying to work through it with positive steps. I finished my Master's in 2020, and I had basically reverted back to my old self during that period. I made a good amount of friends pre-pandemic in 2019, and I really was optimistic about 2020. I was productive for the first 3 months and tried to follow a routine, but it became hard. I had multiple nervous breakdowns during that year because I was tired, overworked, and either underfed or overfed. I was 30 kgs heavier by the end of 2020, and I was miserable. It sucked, but I tried getting back to the gym around April 2021. I made good progress for 2 months, but it was a mix of personal tragedies, extended 4-month lockdowns, being unemployed, and social isolation that made me contemplate ending things. I used to have those thoughts every week for almost 3 months. \n\nI figured I had to sort it out myself, so I began talking to therapists, building a routine, cooking food at home, and getting some sort of exercise in. Most of my friends who were in relationships either broke up during the pandemic/lockdowns, or it became stronger (some of them are getting married soon). I figured I was ready to start dating once we were out of lockdown, so I went on the apps. There were hits and misses here and there, and it got annoying. But, I persisted. I realised that getting a girl's number or message really isn't the end goal. I was still working on casual jobs until the end of 2022. I only began working full time in my field in Jan 2023. \n\nI think once you start working full-time, you build up a good routine. You can structure your daily schedule around food, gym, and much more. For instance, I plan to resume bushwalking on the weekends pretty soon. I also plan to pick up pottery as a hobby or doing art gallery walks on the side. The fact that you're earning your own money and you're taking charge of your life, whether it's the good or bad things, gives you some self-confidence that really works. Once you start working on the problems in a healthy manner with moderation, you will start to see improvements. I have decided to cook more at home, hit the gym at least 4-5 times a week, and be active on the weekends. My current goal is to slim down by Diwali, which is in November. \n\nFinally, at the end of the day, looks will fade. I was recently in a 3-month relationship, and it was a good learning experience for me. I took the breakup in a mature manner and moved on. It really isn't about looks if the girl likes you and wants to continue putting in the time to see you. It's all about your personality and confidence. Even if you're a work in progress and you admit that to a girl who likes you, you will see more success in your dating life. Most girls, like a guy who is in touch with his emotions, put in the work to be a better person and shows them mutual respect.",

If you've never worked out before any kind of exercise will be new and more than what you did before, so it will cause muscle growth... as long as you eat on a maintenance or surplus. Which is gonna suck, since you want to lose weight and gain muscle at the same time, I know, I've been there. It's gonna be incredibly hard if not almost impossible to gain muscle and lose weight, pick either one and prioritize or you're not gonna get either one.\nWhat I did, was walking every day. Every other day I had  a long walk and every other day I worked out.\nMy numbers went up at the gym, I was getting stronger, but I wasn't gaining any muscle because I was losing so much weight.\n\nFor dietary advice, you need to start counting calories or learn how to eyeball things really well.\nWhat I did, was I figure out a meal that was around 400kcals, high in protein, I ate that 2-3 times a day and on top of that I allowed myself to eat one proper meal (one portion) of what ever. With one portion I mean no second plates.\nSo, figure out 1-3 really easy to make /prep meals which you're going to start eating every day from now on, always add some kind of green salad, tomatoes, cucumber and things like that to your meal. They add volume and don't have much calories in 'em.\nThis way you don't have to count the calories after the first time.\nEvery week you can allow yourself a cheat meal, you can eat what ever you want how ever much you want as long as it's all done on that one meal.\nDon't drink your calories, you'd be surprised how much calories are in soda, alcoholic beverages or even milk.\n\nSo let's say you lose 50lb's, what now? \nYou can start eating bit more now, keep an eye on your weight and take note at what point it starts to go up again, it's fine if you gain 10lb's back, you most likely will, but if you keep working out a lot of that will be muscle and even eating on a slight caloric surplus you can lose fat and gain muscle.\n\nLosing fat and gaining muscle is easier to do when you live alone, you have full control of what foods you got in the house etc.\nGet rid of all of your snacks at home so you don't get tempted.\n\nKeep a track of your weight, weight yourself every week, same day, same time.\nTake progress pics of yourself, weekly or monthly, so it's easier to see your progress.\nDon't compare yourself to others, you got those progress pics so compare yourself to only those older pics.\n\nLastly, you're trying to lose weight, not friends, so if you get invited to something, forget your diet for that day, you will eat a bit more for sure but it will set you back only a day or two in the grand scale, so it's not a big deal. If you feel bad about it, just think the party as a cheat meal for that week.",

No matter what you do, you won't reach your goals IF your sleep sucks.\nFix your sleep.\nLook into the issue more, talk to your doctor about it and make it a priority, you won't fix anything before you fix your sleep.\n\nWhen you're at home and feel tired, go to sleep, don't waste the opportunity. If it means going to sleep 6pm, then do it.\nMake up a routine that you do before you go to sleep and go to sleep around the same time every night.",

If you will try to do it from a place of failure, and self hate and strict rules, you\u2019re going to suffer and will be very hard to commit over time.\n\nI\u2019m 33 years old, I was fat, I was a foreign kid in new country, I have self esteem  issues and had no friends almost.\n\nNow I look pretty good, I have a business, I fucked so much to the point I\u2019m not dating anymore if it\u2019s not something special and focusing on my life. It\u2019s still a struggle sometimes, I still have anxiety sometimes, and feel like failure. I get it. \n\nNow I have new issues to worry about, and the things that 10 years ago made me sad are hilarious today.\n\nYou did the best thing you could, you how many years you have for dating?\n\nFirst thing first, start from writing goals, long term and short. In practice, start with a therapist and meditation maybe and basically practice self love.\n\nI\u2019m serious. Tell yourself each day you\u2019re beautiful and amazing as you are. Write 5 things you love, 5 things you did to progress towards your goal.\n\nTake baby steps. Celebrate every win, every small win.\n\nHug yourself when you fail, that\u2019s the point to fail and try again.  Everyone has problems, and everyone fails\n\nListen to podcasts about mindsets\u2026 Im rumbling im sorry, it\u2019s just there\u2019s so many tools out there but first thing first my man you have to train and practice your brain to see yourself in a better light.\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault. School is important, get yourself a good career, hobbies, have fun! \n\nIt\u2019s great you decided to improve things, but it hurts me to read as the language you\u2019re using is so hateful towards yourself. \n\nIt\u2019s just a small part of your life, there is no right or wrong. You didn\u2019t ruin anything, it\u2019s a not a character build in RPG that you mess up with skill points, you can always change and learn from the past\n\nOnce you improve the mental state, everything else will start to click. Not by magic, but you will focus on what\u2019s truly good for you and discover even new things that make you happy and priority shift\n\nDon\u2019t tie your self love and and feeling of accomplishment to specific things, it\u2019s dangerous. \nYou are amazing for trying, that\u2019s it. \n\nYeah discipline and actual do the work, but be your biggest fan also and not a boss in some clothing sweatshop in china\n\nSmall edit:\nWhat helps for me in tough times, is to focus on others. To the point that if I have a bad day, when I feel like I\u2019m in my past mindset and self loathing, I just try to give back the world the peace and support I want and if I helped some old lady with her bags or helped a colleague with a problem- that\u2019s enough for me for that day",

I just felt like I should mention that because laxative abuse has destroyed my body.\n\nIf you go on a calorie deficit, please first go to a doctor to talk about it. If you cannot talk to a doctor then dont go lower than 1500 calories a day. I'd suggest starting at a higher limit to let your body adjust.",

You\u2019ll eat healthier and exercise because you *want to be nice to yourself*. Not because you think that losing weight is going to solve all your problems. Go to therapy.

            "comment": "First off, congratulations bro. I\u2019d trade my virginity story for a Doctorate, in a heartbeat. You\u2019re a badass, in my eyes.\n\nFollowing that, no decent potential suitor will care if you\u2019re a virgin tbh. A decent person will see a person, not a virgin. Conversely, they will absolutely care about the underlying reasons based in self-sabotage.\n\nBe more kind to yourself buddy; we\u2019re all just treading water and some are more prepared for that before going into the deep end. Some of us just get dropped in the shit, and have to figure it out later. Both are fine, as long as your don\u2019t settle for drowning.\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about a \u201clife reset,\u201d nothing that came before that matters. The past is static. Instead, treat yourself inner voice like the mentor to a kid that seems a lot like you. Would you shit all over his esteem to try to help him, or would you be encouraging?\n\nLook for those moments where you\u2019re not mentoring yourself into better habits, and re-examine what your mentor SHOULD say instead. Then take a few breaths, because taking advice sucks sometimes, and approach the obstacle with fresh, reset eyes.\n\nRemember, what you think about your past \u201cfailures, roadblocks, inadequacies\u201d don\u2019t actually mean anything, unless you project them onto the future. As others have said, take it slow. If fitness is hard for you, don\u2019t change everything, start with 5 more gym minutes than last time. Keep iterating one thing at a time until you can barely remember where you started.\n\nYou got this buddy. Much love.",

It seems like finances and career is something you\u2019ve got on check, and that\u2019s most of the population struggles with so count your blessings and have gratitude for yourself and luck.\n\nNow let\u2019s move on to the other stuff. Immediately, the fat stuff is 100% under your control. That is inexcusable. Just getting to a healthy body weight you\u2019re going to feel much better, have better mental health, and it will most definitely make you more attractive. \n\nIs 5\u20197 the tallest guy in the room? Probably not. But you\u2019re also not the shortest guy out there. 5\u20197 is not short enough where it\u2019s a life ender, there\u2019s still a lot of girls who you would fit for, especially if you dress well and have a lean physique.\n\nControl, what you can control. You\u2019ve got one part of your life handled, but atleast give a shot on the other part.\n\nLose the weight, buy some clothes that fit well, take care of your hygiene and hairstyle, and then give dating a shot. To give up before you even try makes no sense.\n\nAnd by the way, pair that with a pHd and a good job and you\u2019ll definitely have a lot of interest. Girls dig smart dudes.",

I\u2019ve been listening to \u201c The code of the extraordinary mind\u201d by Vishen Lakhiani, it\u2019s been more of a mental growth and if you\u2019re open mindset it helped me actually understand some of the shittiest things I experienced in two chapters in a whole new perspective. I\u2019ve been working on my mind set and  it\u2019s made such a big difference, it makes it easier to do new habits and not feel a burn out as much. Not only that but the book made me question what I\u2019ve thought to be true and how much I learned from the people around me ( especially as a child) that actually led to beliefs I built that have kept me down most of my life. I\u2019ve been on a self improvement binge for 6 months now because I was going through post partum and having fights with my partner almost every day and the working on your mindset is really crucial, I\u2019ve slowly started losing weight too because I\u2019ve been mindful of what I eat and doesn\u2019t upset my stomach and by reading what really is in the food I eat. America goes hog wild on putting sugar into EVERYTHING, do you know how hard it is to go sugar free and natural flavor free? Anyways, I\u2019d recommend that book, it might help you think differently about the most random things, and help you understand more about yourself. You got this, it\u2019s been years since I was suicidal but you can change everything, just remember it takes time, I mean you can get good results fast, but do t beat yourself up for not being in shape in like 2 weeks. I\u2019ve seen some amazing transformations that only take a year. Look into an app called eat this much, comes up with super easy recipes to reach your goals with realistic time to get there, just need to know your bmi\u2026. Good luck",

Life\u2019s timeline is different for everyone. your life is meaningful and important and that doesn\u2019t change from not having had sex. you really matter. \n\nyour new job and work from home setup sounds amazing, maybe you could make a small project out of setting to your perfect work from home space. i personally get a lot of joy from curating my home work space! so i guess my tip is to try getting a couple houseplants and maybe some knickity knacks for your desk because having a space that makes you happy can make a difference in your day",

Vitamin D deficiency can cause all kinds of problems - depression, impulse control, irritability, basically a bunch of stuff that can make life suck.\n\nGood news, it's pretty easy to correct! You could get a bottle of gummies, I'd get at least 5000iu. You could talk to your doctor about adding more, too.",

Do fun shit bro. And then you\u2019ll naturally want to do something for yourself. Celebrate the wins! Today is a win, you made it through! Sleep is oh sooo good. Enjoy ya sleep and tomorrow is a new day. Show yourself the good time you would show a female. In these 2 weeks you have to agree to be patient with yourself, and after those 2 weeks you can go back to hating yourself if you like that better. Homie you got this!",

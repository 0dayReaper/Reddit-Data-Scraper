Unfortunately there are bad therapists who shouldn't be therapists. A therapist is not supposed to tell you how to think or feel. I think it's fine if they give you some different perspectives to consider but if you tell them what you want and how you feel they shouldn't try to convince you otherwise. There needs to be some trial and error and a bit of luck to find a good one and unfortunately happening upon a bad one can have negative consequences.\n\n&gt; I think my current therapist is better, but what do I know? I seem to think everyone is great until one day the blinders lift and I realize that I've been repeating unhealthy patterns.\n\nTrust your gut. I have tried a few different therapists over the years, a few were good, a few were questionable/not a good fit, and one was bad. With the unsuitable ones I felt bad after the session in a way that lingered and was different from the kind of \"vulneribility hangover\" that you can get if you choose to open up too much too soon with someone who hasn't shown that they have earned it and can be trusted. I would say that it is good to just observe yourself and see if you consistently feel heard and validated and respected by the person, or are there things they do that you find questionable but sweep under the rug? Do they respect your boundaries, or seem to try to cross over them? Do they teach you skills that help you create a long-term improvement in how you feel about yourself and your life if you practise them? The bad therapist I had essentially tried to convince me to do a bunch of shit that I didn't want to do and made me feel bad without listening to the concerns I expressed. I also had to jump through a lot of hoops to prove that I deserved to have therapy by her. Not good. My gut was always telling me that something was wrong but part of my problem was that I didn't trust it. But I can see in hindsight that the information was always there.\n\nI feel like I am rambling a bit but I hope some of my ramblings can be of benefit in some way.",

You might have to shop around a bit and try a few different therapists before you find one that clicks. A good therapist should validate you and that you are ok, not shame you, set clear boundaries and respect yours, not act superior to you or put you down, and be honest. The method of therapy does not necessarily matter that much as I understand it, a lot of what helps is the therapeutic relationship itself, since you get a safe space to talk and have the things you struggle with examined with someone who consistently show that they are on your side (and has some effective knowledge on what tools can improve your situation).",

So...just know that isolation for the sake of avoiding other humans is unhealthy. It can be very healthy when you need to detox from being around toxic people but even then you should be actively seeking (via internet, books, whatever media you choose or all of them) examples of positive or less dramafied groups and individuals. Also it would pay to remember even the best of us still have our days where we can\u2019t see the good bc whatever is in front of us is just too much or has temporarily beaten us down so don\u2019t give up on a good person(s) just because they\u2019re going through a rough patch. This is when they likely need you the most and one day you may need someone to listen to you or help you wade through some awful situation. Lastly, to help you sort through all those different personalities and such, take some time and do some research on energy vampires, manipulation tactics and dark psychology, how to spot manipulative people, and don\u2019t be afraid to seriously read up on codependency and or recurring codependent relationships and how things can spread from one generation to the next devastating once healthy families indefinitely. The last one may sting a bit if you realize that you are most likely attracting these people unconsciously even though consciously as you stated, you would like to avoid them. This will take some time to read enough books or watch enough credible YouTube videos or college course but I firmly believe the answers to your struggles or somewhere in those subjects mentioned above. Also I would say to seek out and take in as much positive stuff as you can daily or 24/7 just all the time be looking for the bright side. Write down things you are greatful for daily no matter what kind of day you\u2019re having. You don\u2019t even have to understand or memorize it all just allow yourself to be a sponge for positivity and I swear you\u2019ll begin to attract better people and will repel the others. This will take some time but trust me it\u2019s worth it.",

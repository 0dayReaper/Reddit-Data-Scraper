No worries - just keep riding it out. The key isn't to try to demand that the waves of life stop, or to try to control the weather - the key is to learn to surf the waves of life, the ups and the downs. Just keep getting back up on the board.\n\nSo, go easy on yourself. You have JUST started life. Allow yourself to enjoy things - I remember being 14, and I know what it's like to be much older now, and you'll have plenty of time for figuring out what you're going to do with your life later on. I did engineering, biology, and army careers between ages 20 and 30, and learned many valuable lessons from all of them, so don't worry about needing to know what you're going to do right away, it'll all make sense along the way.\n\nBut, the practices of mindfulness, meditation, and stoicism will serve you well into your teen years by giving you a practice to remain centered as other things in your life fluctuate and change.\n\nBiggest thing of all - just relax and have fun and soak up these years by finding ways to be as carefree as possible (seriously). Life is huge and exciting and there's lots to do, but that all comes later - for the next few years, try mostly to enjoy yourself and spend time with family and friends and pay attention in school.",

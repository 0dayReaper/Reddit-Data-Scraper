    "postText": "This is my first time posting here. I'm porbably gonna look insane by the end of this but I'd appreciate and advice or help. My apologies in advance for how long this is.\r  \n\r  \nI'm not having the kind of productive summer I hoped.\r  \n\r  \nI'm a university student who had plans this summer to get an internship, get a paying job, work hard on some personal creative projects, and make meaningful advances in the direction I wanted to go with my future career. Absolutely none of these things happened. The most I can say right now is that I'm taking summer classes to get ahead in my major. I'm often home alone by myself with no one around. I'm trying to logically analyze what factors are driving this pathetic mindset and position, and the following is the best I could come up with.\r  \n\r  \nComparison: I feel like I'm constantly surrounded by people who are in better positions in their life than me. I have two friends who I was talking with yesterday who said they each had some constructive projects they were both gonna work on today with each other (modifying cars, landscaping work, making tools, etc.) I was left sitting there thinking, \"Man, I really wish I had something like that to do or possessed any knowledge on how to do that in the first place.\" Before we went our separate ways, one said I could stop by tomorrow if I had anything like that to work on. I said no, and he promptly replied, \"Yeah, didn't think so.\" So that made me feel pretty worthless.\r  \n\r  \nI recently started dating a girl who I love dearly, but she has a lot going for her that I don't. She recently got connections to someone working for a big company out West (in the industry we both want to work in). They said they'll make a recommendation for her if she applies for an internship out there. She was also employed for a pretty significant paying job at the university, which she'll start working on next semester. She's studying three minors (I only have one). She's one of the heads of a co-ed fraternity with way more of a social life than I have. She made the dean's list despite taking a ton of challenging classes. Overall, she's way better than me, and I'm terrified of her eventually realizing that.\r  \n\r  \nMy parent's were expecting me to get a job which I can't do at the moment due to summer classes and certain obligations I've made (mostly girlfriend related). I have to go six states away several times at the end of this month and during next month directly after my classes are done. I know they're disappointed in me because of this and because my brother has a stable job right now.\r  \n\r  \nOn the whole, I feel like a fucking failure. I feel like I'm flooded with an overwhelming sense of imposter syndrome every time I think about these things and that I have no right to be hanging around these people.\r  \n\r  \nPleasure/No Discipline: I can't seem to keep myself focused on anything. I'm constantly indulging in pleasures and distractions at every turn. Video games, social media, YouTube, etc. It's actually abysmal how bad I've gotten. I've dealt with this issue before but can't seem to get around it this time, no matter what I do. I've gotten to the point where I'm loafing around the house 24/7; I'm pissed off at everything and get irritated by everyone. I'm still working out every day (thank god), and my healthy eating habits haven't completely fallen off. I feel like I'm doing nothing of substance every day and don't know what to do anymore.\r  \n\r  \nI have personal creative projects I want to work on. Still, I can never get around to actually working on them because they become way too intimidating. I should be breaking them down into small manageable pieces, but I can't get the drive to even do that.\r  \n\r  \nGeneral Anger/Depression/Doubt: This was probably made evident already, but I feel a deep loathing. Loathing towards myself, others (sometimes unprovoked), and an overwhelming sense of misery. I feel like a failure in every regard right now and like a waste. I know the things I WANT to do or want to have, but I always feel like my legs are chained down. It feels like something is physically in the way of me actually getting up and going to do it. For lack of a better word, my brain makes it feel WRONG to try and pursue these things even though I desperately want them. I don't know if this is depression getting in my way or doubt about my abilities, but it's so damn persistent at every turn.\r  \n\r  \nSorry for how pathetic this all sounds. ",

Make them smaller. One day at a time. \n\nAbout the problem with focus, check if you have ADHD. There are online tests you can take, to get a first hint. \n\nAnd what I do, I read self improvement books, watch self improvement videos. Every day. That makes me better every day.",

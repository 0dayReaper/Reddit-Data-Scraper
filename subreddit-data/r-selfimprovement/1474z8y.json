    "postText": "For some reason, everyday I have a moment where I am sitting in my bedroom contemplating how low my self esteem actually is. I feel I don't have any positive aspects, I hate how I look, I hate how I dress, I even hate my personality, who I am and I have a very poor vision of myself in everything. It's just that people don't have any reason to be friends with me. I'm not good at anything I do and my confidence in myself is simply non-existent. \n\nRecently, I have been trying to improve these things, I started doing calisthenic exercises a few weeks ago because I was pretty much sedentary before that, and I'm planning on joining a gym and doing martial arts. I've been trying to ignore the bad thoughts that come into my head every now and then, and I am here to ask for tips on how I can improve my self-esteem and my perception of myself.",

Will destroy your idea of self esteem entirely and give you a lot of things to think about\n2. Will help you achieve self love",

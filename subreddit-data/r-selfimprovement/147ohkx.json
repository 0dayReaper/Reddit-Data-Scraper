If you are a porn or TikTok user, don't talk to me about depression and concentration issues. Porn is nowadays widely known as being problematic. \n\nBut Tik tok, this platform is absolute garbage, you cannot possibly gather any useful information there, just because of the fact, that no one can tell you anything meaningful in 30 sec! \n\nAnd self improvement content can become an addiction too and then it's just a new dependency you created! \n\nYour intention should be, you needto go out there and face reality!",

Honestly, it just breaks my heart to see so many young people wasting their potential and being unhappy, just because of this online culture. It can estrange you so much from reality, although it often just a question of getting out of there for a few months, even weeks and people could change. But often they are stuck because of their mindset and their social peer group. The discrepancy between the possibility for change and the difficulty to reach it, is just hard to observe!",

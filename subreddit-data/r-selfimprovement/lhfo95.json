See, in your head, what is possible for an outgoing person is very clearly defined in your head. But also, what is NOT possible for a shy person is very clearly defined in your head.\n\nRemove the labels. \n\nYou're not a shy/awkward/boring person--\n\n--You're just a PERSON who maybe sometimes does shy/awkward/boring things. \n\nThat's it! No labels. \n\nOkay, I hope you can resonate with this. If you want to know what the next step is after this, let's have a conversation. If you're currently struggling with your social life, leave a comment, message me, tell me (or us) what you're going through and we can see if we can offer some guidance. \n\n*muah*",

In my case it was a bit worse than your run of the mill low self esteem. I got to the conclusion that I had no stable identity and hated my very existence so much, so there was long term depression and social anxiety induced isolation involved as well as a not very positive home life, I\u2019ve lived like that more or less since middle school until the beginning of college. It finally clicked in my head that I didn\u2019t have to be that person. I don\u2019t think I could have gone on being that person for much longer anyway. I wanted to find out if I could be different, if maybe there was something worth anything inside me. I decided I\u2019d try even if I look and feel ridiculous. I went from there. A lot of mental work was involved, constantly. Every day. I\u2019m still doing it, but I\u2019m much better now. I only occasionally have periods when those thoughts come back. But I manage them better. There are few things I could concretely list when it comes to what I did to help myself, as it was a long process and frankly I just fought myself and the world every day. As someone pointed out working on your appearance helps, but I think that works if you\u2019re at a baseline of a somewhat ok self-image. Tbh, I only made immense improvement in the last couple of years. Up until that point, it was a constant struggle. Now I\u2019m beginning to feel rather functional. Oddly enough, quarantine was a great time of personal improvement for me.",

I've read things here and there in time, I would always have questions pop up in my mind and would just write them on google (as you do) and I would do \"research\" from there and draw conclusions, I would just try out whatever felt right or whatever idea came to mind, it was just a constant grind in my mind. It took a long time to even become aware of what was happening to me. I only realized at the end of high school that I might actually have something like depression or some other disorder and this wasn't just me being odd intrinsically. I sort of... formed my own concepts and methods of coping in time. I've tried to \"deconstruct\" my mind basically, not in a neuropsychological way, of course, but understand the tendencies and proclivities for certain actions it has, and what their origin might be. And I would actively look for ways to look at things from other perspectives so that I could change my own beliefs, or imagine what a \"normal\" (as in healthy, well adjusted) person would feel like and how they would act, what would motivate them. What the differences between someone like that and someone like me would be. Unfortunately I don't have much concrete information to give to someone else atm since I was doing things in a stumbling-through-the-dark kind of way to help myself and didn't take the necessary time to register them somewhere in writing or formulate theories. I'm currently a 1st year psychology major and have found that some of the things I was doing are parts of existing theories. I've gained a lot of understanding and insight \"naturally\" by going through things by myself so I think that this \"feel\" I have for how things work will help me become a good therapist in the future.",

Someone you think is boring, shy, or awkward is someone I might find interesting, soft-spoken or unique. Now, there's a difference between being shy and being rude, for example. But someone who is shy or considers themselves 'boring' shouldn't try to change themselves to appease others.

While your point is great and valid I think I started calling my self shy/awkward when I felt insecure and not \"insert anything here\" enough. Some people called me boring but unlike shy and awkward I don't mind being boring. I struggle with social skills and the problem is that I used to be outgoing friendly child until a lot of bullshit happened which made me quieter than water. \n\nI wish I could smile more but I sometimes feel like smiling brings me bad people which is why I refused to smile. When I smiled two fat women pushed me where the cars were off the street and laughed at me. \n\nAnother time in 11th grade some weird ass drunk guy started talking to me and followed me around and I was just smiling to my self feeling happy cause the weather was nice. I am genienely afraid of smiling since I feel like bad shit like this is caused by my smile...because usually incidents don't happen unless I smile or say something positive. - \"Today is going to be a good day led to a lot of creepy incidents \" . But I do not want to be insecure since people take out their insecurities on me. Like this girl I used to have classes with, she tried to lose weight and since I was already thin she called me anorexic. I don't know what her problem was. I tried to tolerate her and befriend her but she only ended up hating me.\n\nI have seen guys do the same too, project their insecurities on me and I have no idea how to make them stop since they don't want to. I can understand a girl being jealous of me but guys are surely neither threatened nor jealous. They're just assholes. I don't know what the point of them talking to me is, since they waste my time by insulting me/harassing me. They just want a punching bag for their emotional shit and for whatever strange reason, many people pick the quiet(me). I wish I was not quiet and say something to make them shut up but don't know what since most of the comebacks I tried don't work and they don't respect me to listen.",

I was walking downtown San Antonio minding my business and a random guy in a truck yelled \"you fatass bitch, what you looking at nigga?\". Then the coward drove off. This isn't the first time strangers have harassed me. In 2019, a group of girls came up to me as I sat on a bench and jokingly said one of their friends liked me and she responded \"eww\". Both kind of made me feel ugly because that is how I was bullied in school. \n\nNow I'm seeing myself as attractive because I reassure myself that I can improve. I remember 10 years go losing weight and people finding me attractive. I just need to do that again.",

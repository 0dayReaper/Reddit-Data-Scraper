    "postText": "I recently turned 20 and I've been extremely anxious about the future these past 6 months. I'm afraid of getting older and my friends/i losing the time to play games with each other/hang out with each other. whenever we do hang out or something, all I can think is \"I wonder when the last time we'll ever hang out/play games will be\". I've played roblox and other games with my current friends since i was 14, and i keep thinking to myself how much longer this will last for, and it always gets my mood down.\r  \n\r  \nI've known one of these friends since he was 12 and he just graduated from high school, and the thought of that is so crazy to me, time just keeps moving fast and it overwhelms me. I'm afraid of him having no time to speak to me anymore either, same with my other friends. I just get anxious when I think about me being in my 30s, 40s, so on and having an \"adult\" job. It doesn't help that I don't feel my age, I feel like a teenager even though I only just now turned 20.\r  \n\r  \nI'm afraid of getting older and losing the freetime to do anything as well. the only thing that calms me down enough to sleep at night is imagining waking up in elementary/middle school again with all my memories intact. I'm also anxious about my future in general, I'm in a community college, but I don't know what I actually want to study and i constantly feel like I'm running out of time, I don't know how to stop worrying like this :(. somedays I'm fine and tell myself the future is far off for now, but then I spiral back to these thoughts and it's so exhausting. Sorry that this was so long and I know these problems are a bit silly but I need help because it brings my everyday mood down and I don't know how to stop them.",

Yeah it won't be good times forever, but the bad don't last.. we never fret over the stuff we can't change. It's wasted energy that could be spent on good stuff, so don't turn it into poison. Your time here is worth way more than that",

You might be plagued with what-if thinking. Flip the script and think so what if. It\u2019ll be all good. Nothing is as crucial as you think it is. Nature takes its time yet everything gets done. So it will be with life. Give less fucks.",

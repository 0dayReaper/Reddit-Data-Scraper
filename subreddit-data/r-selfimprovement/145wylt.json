    "postText": "Start making decisions with your future self as a priority.\n\n  \nSo many people live in the present and only in the present with tunnel vision on only what is happening NOW and they make every decision neglecting their future self which leaves them to pick up after them in a selfish way.\n\n  \nYou have to start doing things that benefit your future self and with every decision you make assess how it's going to affect you down the line.\n\n  \nFor example, if you eat rubbish food now are you going to hate yourself for it in a few hour's time and therefore ruin your mood and your self-confidence?\n\n  \nOr if you go to the gym now, you know it's not going to make you feel different straight away but you\u2019ll sit down in the evening feeling much better off for it.\n\n  \nRemember, this doesn't mean you can't enjoy the now.  \nIt's important to live in the present and do things to enjoy the current moment but with the majority of your decisions, prioritise your future well-being above everything else because that will become the present before you know it!\n\n  \nDon\u2019t however sacrifice your happiness now in order to be happy later down the line. This is a trap that countless people fall into when working towards their goals and it leaves them in a state of dissatisfaction and constantly chasing more, more, MORE!\n\n***PS.

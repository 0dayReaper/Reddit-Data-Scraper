    "postText": "# 5. \u201cToo late\u201d is not exists\n\nIn my early 20s I compared myself to others. I compared my achievements with people my age. And it has got me into a trap. I had the fear to start from the bottom.\n\nIf I\u2019ll start from scratch some \u201cBob\u201d will be 3 years ahead of me in life quality, finance and achievements.\n\nI couldn\u2019t let it happen so I stayed at a job that I hated. Just to not feel like I was behind someone.\n\nHow did I overcome it? **I stopped comparing myself to others**\n\n# 4. Don\u2019t rely on anyone but yourself\n\nJust remember that no one will save you.\n\nLuck won\u2019t save you.\n\nYour job won\u2019t save you.\n\nThe government won\u2019t save you.\n\n**Only you can change your life.**\n\nConsistent work and ambitions will get you to your goal.\n\n# 3. Don\u2019t afraid to ask\n\nI lost many opportunities in my life because I was afraid to ask.\n\nI was afraid to get rejected. I was afraid of others\u2019 opinions. I was afraid that people would look at me in the wrong way.\n\nI had a lack of courage.\n\nLife lesson that I learned:\n\n**If you don\u2019t ask, the answer is always no.**\n\n# 2. Happiness is inside\n\nIn the early 20s\u2019 I thought that to be happy you need to have a lot of money, a great car and a big house.\n\nI\u2019m literally laughing writing it right now.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned is you don\u2019t need to have any material things to be happy.\n\n**Happiness is in your head.**\n\nThe formula is simple:\n\nA deep sense that you on the right path + Be in the moment and do you best = Happiness\n\n# 1. Life is easy\n\nEveryone talks \u201cLife is difficult\u201d. But it\u2019s not.\n\nThe point is that if you think that life is difficult, it will be. If you think that life is simple, then it will be.\n\nWhen I have a weak mindset, my brain labels everything \u201chard\u201d. Success is \u201chard\u201d. Make money is \u201chard\u201d.\n\nBut when I\u2019ve created a superior mindset life becomes \u201ceasy\u201d. Magic.\n\nThe life lesson I learned: **Life is easy, you make it hard**",

You are your own person, but the opportunities and adventures in life are in part defined by who your friends are. Choose your friends carefully.\n\n3. There is addiction in your genes. Look out.\n\n4. Take care of yourself. Regular haircuts, decent clothes, and a tidy home might seem superficial, but they make a big difference.\n\n5. Be compassionate and patient with others. Listen to them. Acknowledge and cultivate relationships. People aren\u2019t there forever.\n\nEdit: glad some people found this useful. It\u2019s a little bit personal (especially 3), but it is hard for life advice for myself in my 20s to be impersonal.\n\nIf I were to add anything else:\n\n 6 It is okay to not be in a relationship.\n\n 7 If you are in a relationship and are thinking long term, figure out how well you two can handle disagreements and if your money management styles mesh. It\u2019s not romantic, but romance won\u2019t thrive with terrible arguments and drastically different approaches to debt.\n\n8 Your aunts and uncles and grandparents who want to show you some seemingly dull but practical skill (maybe Uncle Mark could get someone else to hold the light as he rewires the garage)? Learn it. You\u2019re going to need it more than the Team Fortress Classic or whatever you are going to play.",

This is a borderline cheat code to life that most people will never take advantage of. I'm not saying don't hangout with people your age, but if you can get closer to older people who are successful and happy you're essentially skyrocketing your chances of ending up successful and happy. Don't just sit around fire pits drinking beer with your similarly aged friends talking about how \"they're going to do this or that\" - chances are they won't and they don't know how.\n\nUnless you really truly look at your own parents as adequate guides for your future goals and ambitions, it's in your best interest to receive different takes on life from those who are on the tail ends of their careers. Craziest part is, this has become ridiculously easy due to social media.",

In other words, they can't listen to something and sit on it for a few days, they need their 2 cents to be heard that instant because they want to protect their opinions/outlook on life. These types of people could be good people at heart, but in terms of a larger life/in the eyes of successful people they are donezo. \n\nTo try to explain it better, let's call the person who has this type of poor mindset \"Jeff\" (PS - there are a lot of Jeff's in the world). \n\nYou - \"Hey, you see that Bob started his own business?\"\n\nJeff - \"I don't know why Bob did that, that industry is so saturated. I don't even think he even knows anything about it.\" \n\nYou - \"Well he seems to be working hard at it.\"\n\nJeff - \"I think he's wasting his time and money, he's not even good at it, businesses only work if you have this and that and know people.\"\n\n\\*2 years later, Bob is doing well\\*\n\nYou - \"Hey, Bob seems to be doing well for himself.\"\n\nJeff - \"Yeah, that's because he got lucky by meeting (insert whoever).\"\n\nYou - \"Yeah, he met him at a seminar, the guy showed him the ropes.\"\n\nJeff - \"Well that's the only thing business seminars are good for, he got lucky.\"\n\nYou - \"I'm happy for him.\"\n\nJeff - \"Why? Bob just walks around on the phone all day dealing with people. I wouldn't want to live like that.\"\n\nFuck Jeff, those guys SUCK and a lot of people act this way. The problem is that you don't know who is going to turn into someone like this when you're young because you're still ambitious for the future. Once people let themselves get pushed around they become a \"glazed over Jeff\" and get tossed in the bin with the rest of them. Successful people can literally pick up on who is a Jeff in a matter of minutes and they will stay far away from them.",

If my gas gauge is at half tank, I get the car filled, I don't debate whether I should. I do my best to pay bills when i receive them, instead of debating whether I should do it now or later.  My meals are simple, fruit and protein for breakfast, soup for lunch, and protein, vegetable and starch for dinner. I do this because it sucks being in a grocery store with an empty stomach and so many choices.  \n\nIt is as if my ADHD mind is a committee filled with incompetent people with differing agendas, and this idiot committee is hell-bent on paralyzing me into inaction.  I do my best to bypass them as much as possible.",

Maybe set up alarms for bills and alerts for eating because I forget to even do that some days lol",

NO amount of positive self talk makes a difference because I simply don\u2019t have the \u201cmaterials\u201d necessary in the appropriate amounts for my mind to function even somewhat \u201cnormally\u201d anymore. \n\nI\u2019m on an antidepressant (although I hate the idea of taking pills to deal with unhappiness), I see a therapist every two weeks, but in my head I don\u2019t care about ANYTHING. \n\nI\u2019m in my 30\u2019s, and Im so unhappy... I am unemployed, and can\u2019t help but feel that life is just passing me by. I SO desperately want to have a career, a relationship, and to travel, but I can\u2019t even get out of bed most days. My hormones are a mess (low levels across the board). No libido whatsoever.

But then I realize this anger, even tho very just in my opinion, takes away from my moments enjoying MY car. Just wish other ppl saw why I like my car more. Cuz I worked on it myself, understood it. Broke down in it, made it far, and made it look like a racecar compared to how I got it...but ya. I guess you really will never be able to tell some ppl that they are not doing things right and fun...best to just enjoy me car :)",

How should I view my life as easy? \n\nIt could be worse: I know that if I lived in the states I would also have huge debts because of said illnesses. But the fact that it could be worse doesn't exactly make my current life easy. \n\nThe same could be said about point 2: what if you're not on the right path because of circumstances outside of your power? At the moment I'm walking in circles because of the handicaps, and cannot get onto the right path by myself because I don't even know where the right path is at the moment. Yes, happiness is inside, but you cannot always make happiness appear in your head.\n\nSorry for the little rant, but to me the last 2 felt like the \"just be yourself\" kind of advise which is mostly unhelpful if you're struggeling with life.",

You can go outside, you start putting one leg in front of the other and you keep doing that at an increasing rate of speed until you are going faster than you may have ever gone in your life. \n\nThis is called running. After you have achieved running, you can start working on this amazing technique called stretching. Many people are very unhealthy because they never stretch out there muscles or their body and so years of condensed muscle abuse and inflammation atrophy them. There is also this crazy thing that you do called diet, it changes the way you eat, what you eat, when you eat, the types of things you do in your life as far as ingesting other substances, it also has to do with your mental state and mindset about things. A mental diet is just as important as a physical one.\n\nI\u2019m sorry no one has ever told you about this before, but you now have the chance to go out and research this all for yourself, to start applying it and then hopefully, you will have the body and life that you want!",

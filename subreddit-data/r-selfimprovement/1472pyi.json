    "postText": "Looking for guidance. \n\nDecember 30th had left knee surgery. It's 5 months recovery, per knee. Since my insurance has a hard cap on physical therapy visits, I couldn't complete the 5th month of therapy, because the facility suggested I save what appointments I had left for my upcoming right knee surgery.\n\nLost my job, unexpectedly on January 11th. Started collecting unemployment since I was let go days before starting physical therapy. May 10th, I flew to Pennsylvania to help with a family matter. I fell down a flight of stairs and broke 4 bones in my foot. I'm now in a boot for 2 months and not allowed to drive until August. \n\nJuly 13th I'll undergo surgery on my right knee and it's 5 months recovery, per knee. The facility and my hope is I'll be in a job soon to use the employer insurance to finish 40 full visits of physical therapy. Because I didn't get that opportunity with my left knee, the quadricep still isn't strong enough at this time. My unemployment runs out in 2 more weeks.\n\nI'm limited to a desk job since I'm still not released by the doctor to push, pull, lift weight, stoop, kneel, and I won't be released to drive until the 1st week of August. I have zero family for 1500 miles so I'm on my own as far as everything goes. The problem I'm running into is finding a job because no one will work around my physical therapy and the hours they are open. Most places I've applied to say it's required to be available for training 6-8 weeks Monday-Friday from 8 am - 5 pm, for example. I've been applying for remote work but was told Wi-Fi connection isn't allowed. I don't have a router in my apartment, as it's over at the landlord's and I use a WiFi extender they provided me with upon move in. They don't allow me to run an 80 ft cable to hard wire into the router. \n\nI'm starting to stress out because of bills. I'm not considered disabled so I can't temporarily get disability to help with bills. I make too much on employment to get food stamps (I get $2014 a month, after rent $1500 and car payment for a Fiat 500 $434, I don't even have enough left to pay utilities or car insurance. Yet, I make too much for temporary assistance. I don't qualify for food banks, they told me. I don't live beyond my means. I'm in a 500 sq foot apartment in the middle of nowhere. I can't move because I don't have stable proof of income without a job right now. I'm also up 3 flights of stairs which isn't helpful with all of these surgeries, but again, I can't move without having a job. \n\nAny suggestions or guidance would be appreciated. I'm at a loss at this point.",

Take a public bus to work (plan on x2 the time), Maybe it wasn't a good idea to start with-- \n\nwe own our cars and all the cars we bought were old and used. My wife's car we bought for $4000, we got a bank loan and pay like $100ish a month until it's paid off. \n\nOf course with used cars there are plenty and plenty of risks. \n\nWe did hours and hours of research before we bought and of course there were problems and things we needed to fix (Flex-taped the sun roof instead of paying $4000 for a new sun roof).",

I could let the car go but then I have no way to physical therapy for my knee surgery, which is twice a week for 5 months. There is no public transportation or bus in my area. I asked around and the closest bus system is 30 miles away. An Uber would cost me over $100 one way to get to my physical therapy so Ubers would end up costing double what my car payment is a month. I'd move closer to transportation but 1)I can't currently move due to no proof of income and have struggled getting anyone to hire me under my current condition and 2) I can't afford rent in Austin anyhow. There's $16,000 left on the Fiat.",

Water and sewer are both like less than $100/month here. You need a budget. Start cutting your subscriptions every week until you have positive cash flow. I use every dollar by Ramsy, but it's not free. There are plenty of free budgeting options you can even use a piece of paper. \n\nI suspect you're blowing money.\n\nAs far as food goes just because you don't qualify for food banks does not mean you can't go to soup kitchens to get a meal.",

That leaves me with $80 for my health insurance, car insurance, renters insurance and food. All of my utilities are included with rent, thankfully, including WiFi access. I don't have any subscriptions, streaming services, nothing like that, so there's nothing to cut out or cut back on, either, unfortunately. I don't buy anything from anywhere, I hate shopping and I am 42 and still wear a lot of the same clothes from high school because I just try to take good care of my stuff.\n\nYou're right. I could visit a soup kitchen for a meal but I'm under doctor's orders to not drive until August. With how heavy Austin traffic is, I'm definitely not chancing getting into a wreck because I'd get in major trouble driving before being released to do so. So I definitely can visit soup kitchens come August, thankfully.",

Staying at campgrounds for 3 seasons? It's going to depend on your circumstances and how desperate you are I think.  \n\nIf you get your plates run and they find out you don't have insurance you're going to be in trouble I think. I thought it's the law. \n\nRent is going to be the thig you'll want to pivot I think. \n\nYou can also find roomates to board in with, and only maybe owe hundreds.",

So finding a job has been my priority but in my original post, I cite out the current obstacles I'm dealing with. \n\nYou're right......the rent is ridiculous and my apartment is not much bigger than a tiny home on wheels. I was working with a realtor but she said I'd have to move 2-3 hours outside Austin to find lower rent. I'm currently just over an hour outside of Austin. I factored in the mileage and cost of gas to drive 2-3 hours one way to my knee surgery follow up appointments as my Marketplace insurance requires everything be completed through the same doctor that performed the surgery or they will not pay for the follow up appointments, apparently. But physical therapy could be moved to a different location, which is a nice option.\n\nI found some rooms for rent but people are wanting $1,000 plus utilities, which is absolutely ridiculous. At this point, I might have to wait until my first follow up appointment after my last surgery takes place and then just move 2-3 hours out even further for now. Places are requiring me to pay 12 months rent up front since I currently am unemployed and don't have \"stable proof of income\" or the other option I was given was pay 6 months up front and have a cosigner. Having a cosigner isn't an option, unfortunately. In order to afford 12 months rent up front and moving costs, it'd take me draining my entire 401k. Maybe I'll get lucky and find a room for rent for like $600 with utilities included but so far I haven't found anything for under $800 + utilities. My current landlord has the lease written to no more than (2) people can occupy this unit. If I found a roommate to move in with me, they'd only have room to bring their clothes, as there's no room for furniture or many personal items like musical equipment for example, because the apartment is that small. We'd either have to sleep together as roommates in the same bed or I'd have to get rid of my bed and get 2 twins but sleep in the same room. The bedroom now barely fits a queen mattress. Hopefully things start to look up, soon.",

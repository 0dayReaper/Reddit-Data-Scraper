    "postText": "How do you help your friend with self love? I feel she\u2019s quite harsh with herself and puts way too much pressure on herself. So much so that I think she wants to have kids but has huge expectations of what kind of mum she should be. Or not wanting to get married because she\u2019d feel uncomfortable being in the limelight. I don\u2019t care if she had kids/gets married but I\u2019ve known her for years and I don\u2019t want to feel like she\u2019s being held back. She did chat with a coach and wants to do something and has at times said she might want to chat to a therapist. She started a cleanse recently and while there\u2019s nothing wrong with prioritising health, I feel sometimes her behaviour is verging on otherexia. As women, I think it\u2019s easy to feel lost and look at controlling food, to feel more in control with your life. She has talked with a coach but I think she really needs to look into this. \n\nEven though I\u2019ve been into personal development/self love for years and have changed so much from my journey, I think I feel too close to the situation. \n\nApart from her getting 1:1 support, if she\u2019s open to that, I\u2019d there anything I can do? To support her as a friend. I feel like self love is a very personal thing &amp; it shouldn\u2019t matter when other people love on you bc while it\u2019s nice, it doesn\u2019t shift their perception of themselves",

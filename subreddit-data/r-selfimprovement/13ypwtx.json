    "postText": "I have an extremely fixed mindset and didn\u2019t realize before until maybe a few years ago. I have OCD and a lot of the negative and intrusive thoughts are just amplified and it feels like I can\u2019t do anything change or do but I can at the same time. Like I\u2019ll break out the cycle one day then not or some days just be confused on what to do. This really leads me to being extremely unproductive and not changing anything at all even though I was doing good the last few days before trying to improve myself then the negative thoughts come in when Im not productive or where Im supposed to be at even though Im aware it takes time.",

            "comment": "I had severe OCD when I was younger but I wasn't diagnosed back then and I didn't even know OCD was a thing, I just thought these symptoms were some weird \"habits\" that I had, at some point I got so sick of it (specifically the rituals symptom) that I decided to just stop it, the way it happened was that my mind would say (tap this chair 3 times or you'll die) or something along those lines, the way it would usually go is that I would feel soooo anxious and would give in and tap it 3 times (even though I 100% knew that I wasn't going to die if I didn't, but somehow doing it was a huge relief) what I decided to do is to literally stop giving in, so my mind would say these stuff and I just wouldn't give in and would stay with the anxiety for a while, eventually it completely went away, this is what I later discovered to be kinda similar to what they do in exposure therapy. I'm not sure if this would work for you but maybe give it a try? Just literally don't give in to your thoughts, you're having negative thoughts that are preventing you from being productive? Write them down and try to move on, I know how hard it is and I know that it might not work (it's different for everyone and what works for me might not work for you) but I think maybeee it's worth a try? Also, obviously these are just my own personal tried tips but that doesn't mean that I won't advise you to go to therapy",

However, a part of it however small is built around how you present yourself.\n\n\nBeing presentable not only shows that you care about how others see you it also serves as a confidence boost.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------.\n\n\n___A couple ways to improve your looks.___\n\n\n[Skin care] - Taking care of your skin can not only make you look younger it can also clear up acne, even out your skintone, and reduce your chances for skin cancer. (Basic Skincare: Cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen. For body: lotion and sunscreen.)\n\n[Wardrobe] - Unless your rich it's pretty hard to  just suddenly change your entire style. So I'll make this budget friendly for the sake of your wallet. First, you should decide what style your going for and what would fit best on you. (Youtube is a good resource for this). Next, put all your clothes in a pile and sort them based on the categories they fall in (fit's and dosen't fit is a basic pile organizer but you can use whatever). Then, check the remaining clothes to see whether you have/will ever wear these clothes. Finally, you should fill in the gaps. Try to slowly add new clothing you think would fit into your new style. To keep it cheap you can try thrifting or selling the clothes your getting rid of.\n\n\n[Exercise] - Even if it's just 5 mins a day working out consistantly can improve both your appearance and your confidence. Often when thinking of attractive people you imagine someone who is confident in both their personality and looks which makes them exude self-worth people dream of having.\n\n\n[Grooming] - Find a hairstyle that fits you head shape, use deodorant, take showers, and brush your teeth. All things you've heard before just make sure to implement them in your routine.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------.\n\n\nEnjoy your day:)\n\n\nPs. Always open to criticisms/recommendations",

    "postText": "I work a 9-5 office job and feel like every time I get home, Im just extremely exhausted to the point where my eyes are fighting to be open. During work, i\u2019ll be telling myself all the things I could be doing to improve myself such as learning a new skill or exercising but once I clock out I am TIRED. I\u2019m just laying in bed trying not to fall asleep because i dont wanna knock out so early and be up all night not being able to sleep for work but instead i\u2019m fighting my tiredness all day to where once I feel like i\u2019m okay, it\u2019s like 2:30am and I gotta get myself to sleep for work the next day and the cycle begins again. I thought it was lack of sleep but yesterday I went home around 7 and immediately knocked out and woke up 1 and went back to sleep for work the next day and it was the same thing. I also thought it could\u2019ve been the weed i\u2019ve smoking for years but I\u2019ve quit for about month now and in the beginning I felt more energy  but as the withdrawals kind of went away too I felt very tired like as when I would smoke right after work just feelin tired\u2026",

It was only once I weened myself off of it (switched to matcha, then green tea, and now nothing most days), I realized that it was causing a much sharper crash. \n\nExercising before work (I try to do at least 20 min of at home yoga, so nothing major) has really, really helped with this too.",

If I don\u2019t follow all the steps it feels like I\u2019ve got concrete blocks attached to my feet. When I was younger I just drank coffee/energy drinks. There are alot of adverse affects of not taking testosterone or not having enough such as energy level, sex drive being zero, depression, mood changes, severe exhaustion etc. so definitely get it checked out, most men over 35 have peaked with testosterone and start losing it around that age. I still drink a ton of caffeine because I\u2019m still tired after everything is said and done. It\u2019s just part of my life.",

I also felt this way at a mortgage company which put unrealistic expectations on their staff and often had to stay late just to meet the minimum commitments. \n\nWhen I worked from home at my next company, I never felt so exhausted again. I was no longer client facing and did most my communication by email. I had time to whip up breakfast and lunch and take breaks to hang out with my doggos. Even on the busiest days, I was not micromanaged and had the freedom to organize my own work so I never felt overwhelmed.\n\nAll future positions I look for will have to be remote. It opened up the world to me. I will also say a company that *trusts* you to be an adult and manage your own work is also crucial. If you're not getting this where you are, you are more than justified to look elsewhere. Even just trying to put in a few apps a day when you can manage it can actually make your current job more tolerable--there's this hypothetical light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nBest of luck to you.",

Actually, for the first time in several years its my only problem lol \n\nPretty sure it has to do with my poor emotional health plus not getting consistent enough with my sleep. I usually sleep 8 hours but I think I need more like 9. I dont drink too much caffeine but I was a lot for a while there, usually now just a coffee every couple days. \n\nI went through a lot the past few years and I'm finally in a place where things are just normal and stable. I was also very much in the grips of my anxiety disorder for several years up until about 6 months ago or so, have had no anxiety attacks since then except when I was at the ER due to a potentially life threatening health event that happened (hemorrhage after surgery). \n\nSo part of me thinks its just everything catching up to me that I spent a lot of time not dealing with properly. I also don't have enough fun/play/excitement going on. I am getting more comfortable at work but I just started a new thing and it has been a lot to take in, there is so much to learn and they even said it might be the position thats hardest to get started with there's so much happening and important decisions to make, which is the first time I've really been through such a thing like this. Although I do love it and its what I went to school to be able to do, just a lot of adjusting. \n\nI have been exercising a lot but that leaves me tired too. Trying to strike the right balance, also in the worst shape I've been in for a long long time. Still pretty fit though just also could lose 20-30 pounds. I'm working on that and all these things now, main thing I think is being consistent with my sleep and getting 8 hours at minimum, usually there's a lot of night where I get 7-7.5. I think what is right for me is more like 8.5-9. I think if I'm able to make myself do that for a week straight my fatigue will be finally gone. \n\nI guess another thing is I don't even know how to act without fatigue anymore, I'm just so used to not even being able to show up as a lively and energetic person. Its strange to think what will happen when this cloud is finally gone for good. I am getting closer and closer though to finally feeling like normal again after several years of major challenges",

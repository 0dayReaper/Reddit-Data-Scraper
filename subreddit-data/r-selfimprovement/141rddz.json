    "postText": "I'm a 20f and I'm a huge pessimist at times. I feel as though my future will be awful, I'll be a miserable adult, things like that. I'm afraid of getting older and stop playing games/hanging out with my friends. When we do hang out or something, all I can think is \"I wonder when the last time we'll hang out/play games will be\", and I start freaking out over the passage of time. There's a lot of things I want to do like making youtube videos, but I tell myself there's no point, it'll go nowhere, you'll be 30 before you know it, start focusing only on college and having an adult job you have no time for hobbies, stuff like that. \n\nWhenever I think about how fast time is passing, I feel so anxious and start panicking. One of my friends I've known since we were 12/14 graduated recently and I'm freaking out over that too, I miss a lot of my past, and it gets me crying a lot. I want to know how to stay hopeful and stop crying so easily. When I try to speak these thoughts out loud to my mom or therapist, I break down and cry. My throat feels dry and hurts, I feel my eyes swell up, I just cry so easily. I just want to know how to be mentally stronger, if I can even become stronger.",

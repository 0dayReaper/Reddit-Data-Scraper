I've only been in the markets since Dec. of 2020, and this is my first full cycle playing out. I felt STUPID AF for not executing on my original plan of selling off EOY '21 and had I done so, I could have legit bought a house.. \n\nBut anyways, that was obviously a hard lesson &amp; one of my biggest failures thus far in life. But without it, how would I know for the next bull cycle when to sell off? It's mistakes &amp; massive pain like this that sinks in so deeply, that you'll never make the same mistake twice. \n\nI was telling my friend the other day that if there was an app to truly Gamify my life, I'd pay GOOD money for it, if it were actually immersive &amp; effective. But maybe we just need to gamify it in our minds. I'm leveling the FUCK up this year. Let's gooo! +100xp for sure. Appreciate the share!",

And grow quickly as you learn much quicker what does not work. And quickly find out what does work.\n\nAs a example to learn any trade. You must try and find out what works. If you only try what does work. And not find the line what keeps working just before it does not. You wil not become great at anything. And you do that by failure on failure. To gain knowledge. And train your body how it feels. What works. What does not. Cause if you dont try and find that next level and not take risks. You won't improve.\n\nBut improvements you go with small steps. And small risks.\n\n\nJust like pokemon. If your level 5. And you take a level 60 problem on. You might not come back from that. And could fuck yea life up.\n\nAcceptable risks are the key to failing so learning how to seek failure is super important",

There are actually strategies in business and sports where people fail on purpose.\n\nYou can read about this in the book Brilliant Mistakes. The goal is to make low-cost mistakes that you can learn from.\n\nI do this regularly in axe throwing. I deviate from what I know works, just to see what happens.\n\nSometimes the axe bounces, other times I figure out something new.\n\nI also have a thought experiment that I like to use. Basically, I imagine doing it as horribly as possible. From there, I figure out which factors are actually making it horrible, and then optimize those factors.\n\nFor example, if I'm setting up a readerboard to advertise my business, doing it really badly would involve putting the sign in a high-spee, low traffic area with as many characters as I can fit.\n\nIt's going to be completely ineffective. Yet I regularly pass signs from my competitors that I can't even read.\n\nSo instead, I about potential locations, count cars for 5-10 minutes, and choose the highest traffic spot. Then I optimize my message to align with the goal of the sign (lure people into my store).\n\nIts a radical concept but it's served me well.\n\nIt all started with Black Box Thinking by Matthew Syed. Basically, the aviation industry is phenomenally safe because they've made fessing up to mistakes painless and built a proper learning system.\n\nHospitals, OTOH, are relatively dangerous, because that culture and system simply aren't there.",

If the latter then it's probably not the ideal solution. But if you're not giving them attention than you're doing the right thing.\n\n Having negative thoughts is normal and one can only overcome negative thoughts by not giving them heed. So if you're not giving them heed then you're doing right. Negative thoughts like any thoughts are just thoughts. That's it. So don't overthink by thinking that they're 'wrong' or 'unacceptable'. Just like there are good thoughts, there are also bad thoughts.",

You need to understand why you thought that thought, and actively challenge it, and it\u2019s hard work. \nBut in day to day life absolutely shutting down those thoughts can be helpful. They just need to have special time set aside to work on them aswell.",

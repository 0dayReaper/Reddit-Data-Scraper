Punishment doesn\u2019t necessarily help anyone no matter how much we think it will. \n\nRegret isn\u2019t a choice, it\u2019s a judgment. \n\nWe can forgive ourselves when we have humility and realize we actually didn\u2019t know any better because if we did we wouldn\u2019t have done it. The fact that you choose the \u201cwrong thing\u201d shows you didn\u2019t understand why something was the right choice and you only pieced it together after the fact. It\u2019s basically getting a hammer to fix what you didn\u2019t know but then hitting yourself with it. All regret is fundamentally irrational. \n\nJust because you did something or were someone doesn\u2019t mean you have to remain that person or continue being that way. \n\nMost people think the issue made things worse but in reality you already had this false understanding and the situation only brought awareness to an issue that was already present, it didn\u2019t create it. If this didn\u2019t happen you\u2019d still be making the same mistake but just unaware that you\u2019re doing it. \n\nJust know that regret is a form of pride and you have to admit you didn\u2019t know. Punishment doesn\u2019t change you, learning does, and that can be done. You can be different at this very moment.",

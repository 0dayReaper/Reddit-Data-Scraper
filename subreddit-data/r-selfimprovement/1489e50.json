But that's a problem.\n\nWhy?\n\nThat's because of the so-called \"power process of goals\". \n\nWhat is that you ask?\n\nIt's the main means of achieving a feeling of self-confidence, power, strength and the drive to do more.\n\nYou see, there's a need for human beings to have some sort of pride in themselves. This can't be achieved by easy tasks from category number 1 or impossible ones from category number 3.\n\nSo the main goal is to focus on category number 2 which are difficult goals.\n\nThe achievement of goals from this category results in an ego boost. This is good, cause it starts a positive feedback loop. \n\nThe more you achieve, the more you will strive for improvement.\n\nThis can however work the other way around as well. If you are deficient in achieving difficult goals from the 2nd category, you will develop a negative feedback loop.\n\nThe more you fail, the more you will lose your drive to get better.\n\nBut worry not, because there is a way to change all this.\n\nYou have to start small and develop the positive feedback loop from medium difficulty goals that u know u can do. After that you can SLOWLY add up onto that.\n\nThis will prevent you from overdoing something one day and stopping the next one cause it's too hard. \n\nIf you will not go slowly, you might also be more stressed which is really bad.\n\nRemember to NEVER EVER go down the route of defeatism and self-doubt.\n\nGoodluck!",

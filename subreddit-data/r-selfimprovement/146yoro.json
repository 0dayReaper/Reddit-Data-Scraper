            "comment": "It depends on how much you care about things like fat and sodium. It\u2019s extremely easy and affordable to bulk up on things like fast food and ice cream. That said, if you want foods that are low in fat &amp; sodium, but higher in protein and are relatively cheap, I would recommend foods like protein oatmeal, chicken breast, milk, quinoa, nuts (contains healthy fats), and Greek yogurt.",

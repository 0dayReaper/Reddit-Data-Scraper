    "postText": "I just finished my pure math exam and I am confident that I failed. I failed my Additional Math exam last year as well. Everyone, including my mother, was disappointed in me, as I am a straight A student. My year grades look amazing, but I always fail my exams. I feel like Im not smart enough. I feel like a fraud. I don\u2019t want to blame my life\u2019s difficulties, as that is no excuse. I don\u2019t think I have a future, as the only thing Im interested in is Computer Science and it is filled with difficult, heavy math courses. How am I going to survive? I just can\u2019t do it. All I want to do is cry rn. I feel like a waste.",

Maybe find strategies to cope with testing anxiety as it sounds like you may struggle with that.Computer Science is a big umbrella ,that some fields in it doesn\u2019t require as much math.You only fail when you have given up.  Keep at it, you got this op.",

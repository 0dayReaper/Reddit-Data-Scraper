    "postText": "To become highly likeable, you don't need to change your entire life. Just change these 3 things. \nThese are 3 habits of highly likeable people.  \n\nWhen others would attack, they give you praise: Give more compliments.  \n\nImagine you're playing basketball with your friends, you take a shot and you miss.  \n\nFriend A: \"Quit now you can't even make a lay up bro. \"  \nFriend B: \"Dude even Michael missed shots, your form was perfect, try again.\"  \n\nWho do you want to surround yourself with? People like those that lift us up.  \nTell people what they did right.\n\n  \nWhen others see what's wrong, they see whats right: Express your admiration.  \n\nAdmiration distinguishes itself from compliments as compliments put attention on an ACTION a person did, admiration puts attention on a TRAIT of a person.  \n\nFriend A: \"You're a pitiful athlete.\"  \n\nFriend B: \"You're tenacious, you don't let failure get to you.\"  \n\nTell people the traits you admire in them.  \n\nWhen others are disinterested, they're intrigued: Ask about their story.  \n\nLets change up the metaphor, you're at a party and the host introduces you to two strangers. \n \nHost: \"Hey this is OP he's a marine biologist!\"  \n\nStranger A: \"Oh... that sounds... interesting. Oops excuse me I gotta run to the bathroom.\"  \n\nStranger B: \"Marine biology! I've never met one of those. I'm curious, what made you choose that line of study? Why is it important to you? \"  \n\nPeople naturally like those who are curious about their lives, because they're curious about their own lives.  \nFind something to be curious about, then tell people. \"Hey I'm curious about... whats the story behind that? \"  \n\nPraise others actions.  \nPraise others character.  \nExpress your curiosity.  \nPut on your P-P-E to make yourself likeable.  \nWhat are your thoughts about this?",

So if you do want them to be 3 different habits I would look for better examples that differ more.\n\nThat said yeah they're awesome habits!",

    "postText": "Hello:). Ive recently started to journey on the path of self improvement. Im seeing changes and one of my main goals is to cut more of social media out of my life. Instagram and snapchat are a little easier for me to quit and use less. But, my main issue stems from dating apps like tinder and hinge. I would say im addicted to them, I let an app and someone elses feelings online get the best of me way more than I ever should. A part of keeps whispering into my brain just to slow down maybe just tale it a lil easier w/ the dating apps, but another part of me knows I need to cut it out entirely and focus on finding improvement of myself not through others but through my own hardwork. I know this might sound a little confusing but I just need ppl to tell me to get up and keep making a difference. Cutting a few months off dating apps is only going to help you and you aren\u2019t missing out on a lot is what I need to hear, I think?\n\nFAQ: I use tinder too much &amp; I need help cutting it out. I let it dictate my feelings and how Im feeling too much. Any advice or suggestions would be useful.",

A bite of a cookie? A jolly rancher? A sugar free drink? Watch the calories.\n\n\n\nIf you have an iPhone, you can have a friend be your parental control and block out the app.",

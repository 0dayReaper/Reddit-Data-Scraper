    "postText": "Stop watching that shit, it's killing your time, your energy, and even your own potential. You receive no good value or benefits by watching a girl you're attracted to getting railed by another guy who most probably has better looks and money. Oh, and to make it worse, it turns you on and you jerk off to it too? Can't you imagine how pathetic is that? Do you have any idea what you're doing to yourself? If that was your mom, sister, or even your daughter would you accept that? Take some time to think about this bro and how it's killing your potential to become the best version of yourself, like look at the time that you're wasting! You say you have big dreams, goals, and ambitions yet instead of working on them you'd rather waste your time and energy to this shit?!\n\nPorn is poison. Porn is toxic. Quit while you still can.",

Consider the depth and breadth. \n\nEmpathy and compassion are required. You sound like you are telling someone to turn off a light switch. Is it truly that easy? \n\nIf someone is in a pit of depression and you tell them to just stop being sad, you come off as tone deaf. This is similar to that.\n\nHow did you beat your addiction? \n\nShare your methods for defeating your demons, try not to scold.\n\nI truly hope you and anyone reading this will have success on your journey to self improvement.",

Deciding what you want to do about it and to what extent you want it to remain. Because it inherently as the OP portrayed isn't a monster that needs to be slayed, just another part of you that needs to be responsibly accepted.\n\nHere's to hoping I and whoever is on the same boat, reach a point of wherever they want to be.",

Not only that but you desensitise yourself not just to real partners but also to the joys of life in general. Since quitting porn I do find much more pleasure in regular daily activities and experiences. \n\nI think this whole 'you're pathetic watching a guy railing a girl' rhetoric is kind of immature - it's fine to enjoy that, lots of people do.

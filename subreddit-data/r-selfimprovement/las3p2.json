You can't just stop a thought, but they also provide an argument to help it. \"It's in the past, you have your future and the present\". A lot of times, people can get stuck in loops, feeling like they can't change anything because of xyz, but interrupting these thoughts and patterns starts you building healthier ones!\n\nAlso, saying something can't be applied to anyone ever is wrong. People are all so beautifully different, with different experiences and personalities, and different things work for different people.\n\nA way someone could take this advice and make it actionable is to look into meditation and mindfulness. It doesn't help everyone, but it helps some people.",

In fact, a lot of people suppress their trauma and it can be disabling for their whole life. It actually is a survival response to make us more vigilant in situations that seem dangerous to us. Like any other unmanaged body process, it can get the better of anyone.\n\nIt is true, some people do not experience much trauma and therefore have no clue what it is like to experience a trauma response. Perhaps they have experienced trauma but lived in an environment that was supportive and helpful, so they recovered. \n\nYet, most people unfortunately feel shame after trauma, do not have supportive environments and therefore develop PTSD or other anxiety related syndromes. Those who live in perpetually traumatic life situations without support are almost totally unaware of what is happening to them. They can\u2019t even comprehend they experienced trauma and therefore cannot work on it. This leads to unmanaged trauma recovery and usually a very poor quality of life.\n\nEdit: this was supposed to be a response to \u201cso what do you consider a trauma?\u201d But my device is not showing that.

Even if I had a hard time stopping thinking about what has happened to me, I could still look at my thoughts and recognize that that is what they were: thoughts. The ability to form a sort of clinical/objective detachment from my rumination didn't stop it in its tracks, but at least started the process of turning down the heat. Kind of like if you are having a panic attack - t helps to know objectively what is happening, because then there is part of you that recognizes it will eventually pass and that you aren't stuck in that state or dying.",

I didn't get to have a normal childhood, I never rebelled or went out to parties in highschool despite wanting to, I have had alopecia all my life and lost my hair in first grade still bald now at 21. Never kissed or dated anyone. Went on 2 dates my whole life, one was prom. I was heavily abused by my mom and grandfather, and my dad wasn't around for 4 years from 16-20 because he got with a woman who already had kids of her own, he got her pregnant twice, and now I have half siblings who have 3 sisters of their own who me and my other half sister barely know. Her daughters bullied my sister, and she called the cops on my dad, lying about him hitting her, I know my dad, he is stupid but the only real advice I remember him giving me when he was extremely relevant in my childhood is to always respect and never hurt women. Same woman used to go around and tell people I was a pedophile, despite me never ever being mean to her or even speaking to her, because she didn't want my father's family near her new daughters, one of whom was my Goddaughter. I have nothing to live for. The past is too fucked up, to the point where it heavily effects the present and the future. I wanted to date at least 5 or 6 women, get married by 26, and have my first kid by 28. Now it's impossible for that to happen without the marriage failing and the child hating me for raising it in a broken home and being a bad father. Plus most relationships don't last if you only date 1-2 years before marriage. Now I'm going to be an old parent, if a parent at all. I also have a lot of jealousy and resentment problems because of my mother's abuse causing me to never have the highschool or college experience I wanted, so when I see others living the life I wanted, and when I imagine my own children and family living that life, I develop a sense of hate, or a grudge, toward them. My life isn't worth living. I can't escape my past. It's literally impossible at this point. There is no reason for me to be here anymore. The only reason why I'm not dead yet is because I'm too afraid to kill myself. I'm too afraid of one of my parents finding me. I'm too afraid of how people will take it, probably laughing about it, pretending like they still cared, pretending we were closer then we were, using my death to send a message to others or to Jumpstart a career as a speaker against suicide, essentially using me as a martyr, and also the idea that oblivion happens after death, since my faith in God is dwindling.",

I find meditation or yoga (especially difficult yoga that makes my muscles ache!) are really good for rebooting my mind. From there, I try to journal and give myself perspective on my situation because my mind has calmed down. Part of letting go is not giving the power to let your trauma eat you. Talk therapy and meds have helped me. Whenever I feel my mind pulling towards that overthinking mindset, I literally go NOPE and focus what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s kind of like arguing with a toddler- it\u2019ll get you nowhere and you\u2019re just gonna end up exhausted and frustrated. Instead you just have to force the toddler to do what\u2019s best for them, because you know it is, even if they\u2019re screaming and kicking the whole time. I like to also think of it as temperance or healthy boundaries for yourself.",

Whenever I realize how my brain is thinking too much, I tend to go in a quit room, take in a deep breath, hold it for around 6-7 seconds and letting it out slowly for 8-9 seconds. Focus on breathing and clear your mind, completely blank. This will help freshen up your mind.\nHope this will help",

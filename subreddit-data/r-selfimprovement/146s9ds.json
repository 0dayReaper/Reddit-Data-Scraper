    "postText": "I have worked in the field of occupational therapy for over 10 years, largely with children (0-18) on the autism spectrum. I also have a younger brother on the spectrum and have always struggled myself with OCD (yes, I was the kid who felt like she hadn\u2019t apologized \u201cenough\u201d for doing something \u201cwrong\u201d if I didn\u2019t do it a certain number of times that sounded a certain way when I said it). \n\nI have found a little fun way to work through things that cause anxiety/perseveration and maybe it can help you, too. \n\nTake what you are concerned about. Say it\u2019s running into someone you know that you don\u2019t want to see. Now, think of all the worst scenarios you can think of. Out of  those, think about which are actually most likely. Now, out of the ones that are most likely, can you deal with those if they happen? \n\nWorking through these things in my mind has taught me that many of the things I worry about are actually within my limit to accomplish and overcome.",

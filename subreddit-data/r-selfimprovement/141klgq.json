    "postText": "Bad habits are a nightmare to get rid of. One thing I found helps me is actively giving them negative connotations.\n\nI've got an issue that I think many could relate to - when I wake up, instead of getting out of bed I'm spending anywhere between 30 minutes and 2 hours just scrolling on my phone. \n\nI've began actively calling this (and similar bad habits) \"basement dweller behavior\". You don't wanna be associated with basement dwellers, do you? Then stop that bad habit.\n\nJust something you can do yourself to give that much needed motivation boost to actually start improving yourself.",

That alone will give you great results.\n\nFor exaple, after work, avergae people watch TV or scroll thier phone/computer.  Go read a book, work on a project, etc.",

I also prepare my outfit for the next day the night before. Usually once I\u2019m out of bed to turn off my alarm, I\u2019ll find it much easier to just throw on the clothes that are sitting there since I\u2019m already up, and by then my mind is out of its morning daze, and I\u2019m ready to get started",

Another way to boost your motivation is by using the forfeit app. You need to send an evidence completing a task, or you lose money. The fear of losing money can really kick your butt into gear and help you ditch those unwanted habits.\r  \n\r  \nTo tackle your morning phone scrolling, try placing your phone far away from your bed. That way, you'll have to physically get up to turn off the alarm, making it harder to fall back into the scrolling trap. Plus, create a morning routine that excites you\u2014a little self-care, exercise, or a delicious breakfast can make getting out of bed more enticing.",

    "postText": "I have a future in mind, and have made major progression towards it in the past few years, but I don't feel confident on what steps to take to rearrange the moving parts I'm working with. I have great plans and ideas for my future, but I'm very much stumped on the mini steps of what to to do in the present, so that I can get the resources/circumstances/experiences/new beliefs that will empower the accessibility and effectiveness of the strategic plans that are essential to making my future goals coming true. I've gone through phases of being perfectionistic and basically using sheer willpower to force myself to do things. But I don't want to be in survival mode forcing myself, I want to naturally grow into supporting myself with the way I live so that it feels interesting and nurturing and not something I force myself to do out of survival. I want to be doing things because it feels like a great part of being in a mutually supportive community. However, I don't know how to get my lifestyle to accommodate any community. I'm depleted by my job. \n\n\nThis train of thoughts keeps repeating all day when I'm at work for the past few months: \n\n- I need a better job that doesn't let my mind wander and focus on horrible past experiences. \n\n\n- I need a better job to have the energy and time to make friends and do life enriching activities like go to the gym or hikes. \n\n\n- I need friends or someone who can either teach me or go on a simultaneous journey with me on how to develop a strong athletic muscled body so that I can be assured that I am not quiet and calm because I am weak and subservient as I've been told. I am quiet, calm, and empathetic because that is my personality that is led by my strong ethics and values. My values are strong because they have been shaped by suffering. (This is one of my major dreams,- to be physically strong so that I experience less physical and emotional discomfort and pain. Or at the very least so that I can know for myself how things change when I am physically strong)\n\n\n- I need better confidence in order to get a better job. My current job erodes my self respect. I don't know what I should be doing so that I have confidence in what I have to offer at a job.\n\n\n- I'm often trying to mentally prepare myself for future instances, for what I should do or say when I feel harmed by somebody or somebody feels harmed by me, and how we can have a conflict resolution in a way that doesn't villainize anybody and doesn't escalate and lead to hopelessness for anybody\n\n\n- I'm afraid to take risks because it is so ubiquitous to villanize and condemn and misunderstand people, and I am afraid of what happens if I speak and I offend somebody, or if I interpret somebody as aggressive and demeaning towards me. So I end up silencing myself and disappearing to be proactive and not set myself up for future regrets.\n\n\nSorry that was kind of a lot of writing. I'm interested to know what do you think from an objective perspective is happening and what I should do to gain control and traction, considering my obstacles. Thanks for taking the time.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nI'd love to hear if you have been through a confusing time of not having the right circumstances and resources to make your goals realities, and what you did to make things move forward?",

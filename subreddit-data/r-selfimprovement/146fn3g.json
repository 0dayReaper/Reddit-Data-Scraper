Any \u201ccontrol\u201d you have is using the things you have final say over on things you don\u2019t. \n\nThe Stoics start by saying \u201cis this up to me\u201d, and from there if it isn\u2019t they\u2019re dealing with their judgments.",

In all of these cases that extra line makes it easier to see what the next step is which is what you\u2019re mentioning. \n\nAs you might imagine, people *don\u2019t* know what is and isn\u2019t theirs, and even if they do (as also seen by the Stoic forum) they still need to look at their judgments.",

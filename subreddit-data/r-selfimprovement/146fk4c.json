    "postText": "I used to like this girl few months ago. Back then she told me she doesn't want a relationship. I genuinely accepted and moved on to focus on myself. Now after some 6 months she sent a friend to ask me if I still like her. I said no initially as I don't get good vibes from this one but on the other hand it is also kind of distracting me from my duties. What do y'all think guys? Let me know your pov.",

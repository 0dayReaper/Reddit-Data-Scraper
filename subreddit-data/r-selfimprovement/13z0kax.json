    "postText": "(Kind of a rant but it has a productive idea behind it)\nI\u2019m tired of always comparing myself to someone I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve always had big shoes that I thought and have been told I had to fill, and I always expected the most of myself. And because of that I\u2019ve felt this pressure that I\u2019m not able to do anything I want, that nothing works out for me. But I now know why, it\u2019s because I\u2019m too busy trying to do what people expect of me. Now obviously it\u2019s good to have some expectations set by people, but I have to ignore some of them so I can truly grow as a person. So here\u2019s my plan; 1. focus more on myself. This means spend more time doing what I enjoy and want to do, not go to every single events just to please 1 person. 2. Note down who I am and what I enjoy. I have to get to know myself better if I want change. 3. Get a job. Money doesn\u2019t buy happiness, but I can use it for hobbies and spending more time with friends. 4. Workout more. I used to workout to mainly impress this one girl, who I kinda still like, but I kinda stopped after a while. I have been working out for a few weeks now, but not as much as I used to. 5. Socialize more. I consider myself an introverted extrovert, so although I do enjoy talking with people, I don\u2019t show it and I act tired all the time (because I am). But I think that if I just try some more, I\u2019ll get used to it. I really want changes, so I\u2019m gonna stick to this. Hopefully this helps someone else who wants change.",

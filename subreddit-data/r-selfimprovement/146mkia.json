    "postText": "To preface, I don\u2019t believe I am ugly or anything of the sort. I am just aware of my physical traits and qualities. \n\n\nSo I\u2019m a pretty chubby girl. Round face, my teeth are pretty gapped, and I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m stereotypically \u201cattractive\u201d \n\nI believe my best features are my eyes, and my lips. \nBut body wise, I\u2019m a thick girl, actually no I\u2019m just fat, and that\u2019s ok. I\u2019m taking like 205 pounds 5\u20194. I suppose I hold it well. I have muscular legs, somewhat of a waist and dress relatively okay. \n\nso HOW and why do people come up to me and call me pretty constantly??? I am actually confused? I\u2019m saying women that are in impeccable shape, will come talk and flirt with ME! And I gotta look twice I\u2019m actually confused? Likewise with men, I get told I\u2019m beautiful, pretty, sexy. But how?? And where??, \n\nI see myself in windows and have to double check if people\u2019s eyes are actually okay?! \n\nI\u2019d love to see the insight on this.\nThank you in advance",

But I am the complete opposite of you in terms of body composition.\n\nAnd maybe this is eye opening in terms of the phrase \u201cbeauty is in the eye of the beholder\u201d\u2026there isn\u2019t one standard of beauty. Even though it might sound cliche, it\u2019s true that we are all beautiful in our own ways. The proof is in our experiences. Though we all look different we still experience instances where others find us attractive. \n\nI think the reason why I feel the way I do is because I was so heavily bullied growing up. I *knew* that I was not beautiful. And then suddenly one day people saw my beauty? I couldn\u2019t understand it. I still don\u2019t. \n\nBut to me, those years when I was being bullied, I trekked myself to find my own definition of beauty. \nIt confuses me when other people see my beauty. I know the same people who say that I\u2019m pretty can say that I am ugly with a small shift of societal standards. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this makes sense but presently, it does not matter if somebody calls me ugly or pretty. It means nothing to me equally. \n\nI guess, for me, i can\u2019t understand how people find me attractive when it was people who also didn\u2019t find me attractive. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m just rambling. This probably doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m still trying to piece it all together.",

Maybe you carry yourself in such a way that appeals to people. Maybe you are a kind person or have other attributes people like; but the way they compliment you is what they traditionally think is a good hearing compliment. Sometimes people will be afraid to say \"You are a very kind person, I like how you treat people\" because that might sound weird- but they might say \"You are a beautiful person\" instead.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI don't know if this platform is suitable for the question I have, but I'll will never know if I don't try.\n\nBefore my question I want to explain something about my situation. I am 25 years old and I have just ended a 4-year-long term relationship with a really sweet nice guy who I really love the way he is. I ended things because the relationship wasn't equal anymore and I got walked all over by him. I don't just want to blame him. I'm also blaming myself because I am struggling to have equal (love) relationships. I normally felt like things ''happen to me'', but I'm starting to realize it is because of my low self-esteem. I think it is due to my past. My mom is a very loving and caring woman and my dad was very dominant over her (he is a nice man, but has been through a lot what gave him narcissistic traits). They're divorced for 2 years now, my mom stood up for herself just like I finally did.\n\nAt this point I want something to change. I engage a lot of physical activities and I am reading books about self improvement for a better self-esteem. I am currently reading 'Breaking the habits of being yourself' of Dr. Joe Dispenza. I really like this book because of the (neuro)science behind self improvement techniques.\n\nFinally here is my question: I'm looking for people who can relate to my story and have been able to break this vicious cycle. What did you do to heal? Do you have any recommendations for me (books that align with my interests)? Feel free to share your story with me also (even if you didn't heal).\n\nThank you already.",

            "comment": "First off, great job standing up for yourself and working on yourself. The hardest part can be spending some time alone and investing in yourself (emotional intelligence, healing old pain, learning new skills, taking care of your body and mind) and it seems like you're doing that. I'd encourage you to stick with it and clarify your identity on your own because these things can get enmeshed during a long relationship and discovering exactly who you are helps you make the best choices down the road.\n\nA few other recommendations:\n\n* Therapy really is helpful for understanding relationships that went south, addressing our habits and baggage which contributed, and making better decisions next time. Even if it's just a few sessions I always find this helpful after a breakup.\n* Invest in social circle. It's really important to have a supportive network during these transitions, and it takes the pressure off of finding a new relationship since many of your needs are being met platonically. Trying out new meetups, getting to know coworkers better, re-igniting old friendships are all good options, so is volunteering.\n* General habits: Keeping a clean apartment, exercise, meditation, journaling, reading, and being in nature are all crucial for my mental health, and stabilize transition times significantly. It sounds like you're already doing most of that, but just a suggestion to make them as consistent as possible.\n* Books: Who Moved My Cheese is a book on dealing with change, and I found it especially helpful after a bad breakup. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius is stoicism, and it's so practical that reading a random page each morning will improve most days. Most of all I think I'd encourage you to read something you find fascinating. Fiction, science, history, whatever makes you curious and invested and keeps you turning pages. Self improvement is good to make us better, but it's a shame to endlessly look for defects to fix or gurus to learn from. Let yourself enjoy the process and take days off. We aren't preparing for a test, we're just living our lives.\n\nWishing you all the best!",

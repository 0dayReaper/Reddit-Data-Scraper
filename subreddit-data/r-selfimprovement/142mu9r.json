    "postText": "I'm 19 with two kids, an infant and a toddler. I'm living with my dad at his house along either my boyfriend. I am very grateful to be here even though I don't deserve to be here. \n\nI am a POS mother, partner and daughter. I don't want to go into details but I tend to be a hypocrite, take advantage of others for my own benefit and lie. I explode daily at my kids or my partner for things that can be easily fixed but are just annoying because I am the one that has to fix them.\n\nI am unheard and unseen by my partner, it feels. He engages in conversation with me but when it comes to serious matters he nods his head and doesn't follow through. All I want is to be better appreciated as a mother and treated more like a lover instead of a roommate and maid. This has lead to numerous screaming matches, me kicking him out twice and then begging him to come home, and I hit Jim a couple of times a long time ago. I know these are not healthy behaviors especially when wr have children. I would like to improve my relationship with him rather than break it off.\n\nMy kids are a handful and I know it's not their fault. I have been a horrible mother by disciplining my toddler the wrong way and trying to distract them throughout the day instead of engaging them. I just don't want to deal with it. I lay in bed and hope they will leave me alone and play.\n\nI smoke weed everyday and mooch some off my dad when I have none. I can't hold down a job, and suck in school when though the world was handed to me by foster care. I don't clean much and barely shower unless my boyfriend is. I look dirty, I'm nearly 180 pounds at 5 feet tall, nothing fits right on me anymore and I am just not the old me.\n\nI have therapy coming up on the 13th which I am excited about. I'm scared that things will improve inside my head but what about my external problems? My bf that Hates cleaning up after himself, is defensive when confronted about these issues instead of understanding which leads to arguments, my disdain and regret for being a mother and deciding to have my children, will it ever end? \n\nI have zero motivation. I want to be a good (eventual) wife and mother. Sometimes I'm wondering if these problems are all in my head and I have a perfect family and I'm the only one with an issue. I seem to be the only one nagging and unhappy about how my partner cleans and cares for the kids (as in he does it poorly). \n\nIf I could pack my bags and get the he'\nll out of here with no baggage on my back I would. I'm exhausted. I can't believe I did this to myself at such a young age. I want to get better.",

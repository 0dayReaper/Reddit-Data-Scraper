    "postText": "1. Make your bed first thing in the morning: It starts your day off in a positive note and gives you a sense of accomplishment.\t\n2. Before sleeping, put your phone in a different room and buy an alarm clock: Easiest way to not check your phone in the morning. If you do check your phone, you start your day being reactive rather than proactive. Preferably, no phone first hour of the day. \n3. No phone last hour of the day: You clear your mind to have a better sleep and you wake up much more refreshed.\r\n4. Turn off phone notifications: This lets your phone work as a tool rather than let it control you. You're on your phone when you want to. If people need something from you, they can call you. \r\n5. Drink Electrolytes first thing in the morning: Helps you stay properly hydrated throughout the day as it can help retain fluids. I personally use LMNT (not a sponsor).\r\n6. Caffeine after 90 minutes: Adenosine receptors (which promote sleep) are not very active when you wake up and Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors. If you wait for 90 minutes, caffeine is more effective at blocking the receptors to keep you alert and you won't experience afternoon crashes.\r\n7. Get sunlight (preferably outside) as soon as you wake up: Viewing light early in the day is the most powerful stimulus for wakefulness and it helps you fall and stay asleep at night (even if it is cloudy). The rule is 10 mins if cloudy, 5 mins if sunny, 20 mins if rainy. Last resort is to get near a window if you cannot get outside. Artificial lights do not work as well.\r\n8. Use dim lights or side lamps in the evening to help with sleep: Unlike in the morning, even a bit of Artificial light (like from your phone) can disrupt your sleep. \r\n9. Use sleep mask over your eyes: Any light will disturb your sleep.\r\n10. Lower your body temperature at night: You sleep better when your body is at a lower temperature (which is why heavy exercise, which raises body temperature, before sleep, makes it hard to fall asleep). I deliberately open the windows 2 hours before I fall asleep to create a cold climate. \r\n11. Actually sleep 8 hours a day: To get 8 hours of sleep, you need to be 9 hours in bed. On average, you are awake for 1h during the night (most of the time, you don\u2019t even notice it). \r\n12. If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it.\r\n13. Go to sleep same time every day and wake up same time (including weekends where 1h deviations are ok): Your body will start to wake up and sleep naturally. To stick to this, choose a realistic time. 4 AM is not realistic for me to stick to on weekends because I need to be in bed at around 8PM to get 7-8 hours of sleep. 7 AM works for me as I can be in bed at around 11PM every day including weekends. \r\n14. Don't eat at least 3 hours prior to bed: Helps you fall and stay asleep.\r\n15. Do hardest tasks first thing in the day: Give your energy to what matters most.\r\n16. Start and end your day with gratitude: Everyone has something to be grateful for. A partner, good health, close friends, interesting hobbies, etc. \r\n17. If you're overwhelmed, go for a walk.\r\n18. f you're still overwhelmed, put pen to paper: Thinking is unstructured and chaotic, while writing is more systematic and solution oriented.\r\n19. If you're still overwhelmed: Look at the challenges you currently face and compare them to the ones you thought you'd never get over.\r\n20. If you're still overwhelmed: Take 3 deep breaths and make the exhales longer than the inhales. This will reduce your heartrate. \r\n21. If you're STILL overwhelmed: This too shall pass.\r\n22. Track your spending: Easiest way to not overspend. You can't improve what you can't measure. \r\n23. Take the stairs instead of the lift\r\n24. Plan the next day before going to bed: To remove decision making fatigue.\r\n25. Prepare next day's clothes the night before: Also to remove decision making fatigue. \r\n26. Every day, set a 10 minute timer to clean whatever is around you: A clean environment reduces stress.\r\n27. Brush your tongue: Morning breath comes from your tongue not tooth. \r\n28. Don\u2019t skip flossing: Main causes of gum issues. \r\n29. During work, eat foods that are easily digestible: Your body spends a considerable amount of energy digesting food, which is why you feel sluggish after a big meal. Foods that are easily digestible (which make you hungry again really quickly) are things like fruits &amp; vegetables. \r\n30. Even better, do work when you're fasted for optimal productivity: While fasting, the energy you'd normally use to digest food is available to be used by the brain.\r\n31. Spend 30 minutes every day alone with your own thoughts: We're bombarded with too many distractions that it's rare nowadays to spend time alone. \r\n32. Never stay seated for more than an hour.\r\n33. Park as far away from work as possible to get your steps in.\r\n34. Be interested rather than interesting: Stop trying to impress others by talking about yourself, instead, be genuinely interested in others to build rapport. \r\n35. Avoid arguments, you will lose anyway: If you lost the argument, then you lost. If you win, then your opponent's ego takes a hit, so you lost anyway. \r\n36. Set a 10 minute timer now to unsubscribe from emails to help you clear your inbox. \r\n37. Leverage browser extension: YouTube, at least for me, can be my biggest distraction. \"Unhook\" browser extension has been a game changer to remove YouTube recommended videos and avoid me from getting into a rabbit hole. There is an equivalent to whatever Social Media App that distracts you the most. \r\n38. Tell someone how grateful you are for them: It will feel awkward when you start doing it, but it will become normal. Just put yourself in their shoes, how would you feel if a random friend just messaged you and told you how grateful they are for you? \r\n39. Ask questions that cause the other person to think: The best way to build rapport is to ask these kind of questions. We spend too much time having small talks.  \r\n40. Posture up: Your aura will be different and you will immediately feel more confident. \r\n41. 80/20 rule productivity rule: 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. Make sure to focus on that 20%. If you're a YouTuber, that 20% is making videos. If you're a coder, that 20% is coding. \r\n42. Control the people you are around and the content you consume: You are the product of the people you're around and the content you consume.\r\n43. Cold Showers work: Taking cold showers has been scientifically proven to increase your Dopamine baseline. The baseline indicates how \"motivated\" you are to do things. This is not just about doing things that are uncomfortable (although that's another valid reason).\r\n44. Take these supplements everyday: Vitamin D (During winter or if you don't get to see the sun a lot), Zinc (for immunity &amp; testosterone), Omega 3 Fish Oil (promotes brain function), Vitamin C (if you get sick a lot), Magnesium Biglycinate (before bed to calm you down and because most of us are magnesium deficient).\r\n45. Notice the color of people's eyes: Easiest way to train yourself to practice eye contact. \r\n46. Repeat the name out loud when you meet someone: Easiest way to train yourself to remember names.\r\n47. Every time you leave a room take something that doesn't belong there and put it away: When it becomes a habit, your house will stay tidy.\r\n48. Teach what you learn: It will force you to spot gaps in your learnings. \r\n49. Take up space: This will subconsciously increase your confidence. \r\n50. Admit when you're wrong: People will respect you.\r\n51. Start with Why: Not the How.\r\n52. Think from the other person's point of view.\r\n53. Listen more than you speak.\r\n54. Listen to hear, not to respond.\r\n55. Do not post anything online that you wouldn\u2019t' show to your parents, explain to your child, or have an employer find.\r\n56.  If you're sleepy: Take 3 deep breaths and make the inhales longer than the exhales. This will increase your heartrate and wake you up.\r\n57. Make decisions that the 5 year older version of yourself will be proud.\r\n58. Appreciate people the way they are, not the way you want them to be.\r\n59. Buy experiences not products.\r\n60. Follow your breath to bring you to the present moment.\r\n61. Smile: People smile when they are happy, but they also feel happier when they smile. \r\n62. Keep your working spaces clean and clear: Helps declutter your brain as well.\r\n63. Delayed Gratifications over instant gratifications.\r\n64. Help someone else: There is always something you can offer.\r\n65. How to stop caring what other people think of us: Realize that we don\u2019t care about what we think of other people. Nobody is thinking about you the way you are thinking about you. They're all thinking about themselves.\r\n66. Don\u2019t see yourself as a victim of what happens to you, but as someone who's given the opportunity to change and grow.\r\n67. Stop trying to get love, focus on giving love.\r\n68. Stand up for yourself, but without being defensive. \r\n69. Focus on what you can control.\r\n70. From time to time, spend 20 minutes writing why your partner means so much to you. It's easy to forget that.\r\n71. How to be instantly likable: Get the person to do you a favor. We like people not so much for the good they have done for us but for the good we do for them. Watch my stuff in a cafe is a perfect example. Works with small favors not big one.\r\n72. Make goals public to infer accountability.\r\n73. Eat more slowly to eat less as you allow your body time to digest the food.\r\n74. If you're stuck solving a problem, go for a walk, and try again.\r\n75. Write one important quality your partner has, and explain why it's important.\r\n76. For important decisions, trust your gut. For minor decisions, weigh the pros &amp; cons.\r\n77. Praise people (especially children) for their effort not their ability.\r\n78. Don\u2019t rush in giving advice. \r\n79. The One Thing: For maximum productivity, ask yourself: What is that one thing that if I accomplish today, will get me closer towards my goals?\r\n80. Deal with emails at the end of your day and use your prime hours to work on that One Thing.\r\n81. To reduce social media usage: If you buy a new phone, don't sell the old one. Keep social media, games, and all distracting apps there and make your new phone distraction free. Go out only with your new phone.\r\n82. Take long hot showers at night to help you sleep better and to give yourself time to think creatively. Shower thoughts are real.\r\n83. Don\u2019t shop your groceries when you're hungry.\r\n84. Spending time in nature makes you calmer.\r\n85. Leave your headphones at home: Give your brain room to think and be quiet. We're so used to consuming, not reflecting. Stop consuming other people's thoughts and start consuming your own.\r\n86. Tonality &amp; Body Language are key to charisma.\r\n87. Do more than what you're paid for: Assuming you want to progress your career.\r\n88. Take 3 deep breaths before an event that makes you anxious: Like talking to the opposite sex, an interview, etc. Exhales longer than an inhale. \r\n89. If you're nervous before an important event like a speech or an interview. Tell yourself that you're excited, not nervous. Excitement and Nervousness are psychologically the same. \r\n90. Practice saying no and prioritize yourself.\r\n91. When you take a break, do things that don\u2019t require a lot of thinking like walking, doing laundry, and don\u2019t stimulate yourself with pleasures (especially your phone). \r\n92. Make time (5 minutes) in the afternoon to reflect on how your day is going. A lot of times, we get too sucked in and zooming out in the middle of the day can be beneficial. \r\n93. Explore new things to enhance creativity: Try a different coffeeshop today, a different movie genre, etc.\r\n94. Don\u2019t hit the snooze button.\r\n95. Take care of your skin: For the majority of us; moisturizer twice a day (use different ones for AM &amp; PM), cleanser twice a day, and exfoliation 3 times a week. Pick any highly reviewed product from these categories.\r\n96. For those struggling to drink more water: Buy one of those water bottles with straws inside them. It makes the habit of drinking water more automatic as you don\u2019t have to lift your head up to drink water. \r\n97. Spend time with your family. Not everyone has that luxury.\r\n98. If you're anxious, ask yourself, what is the worst that can happen?\r\n99. Every night, ask yourself: What are the things you did well today and what are the things you can improve. \r\n100. Capture what you learn: Your brain can only hold so much information. If any of what I wrote resonated with you, note them down because otherwise, you'll most likely forget about them.

The idea being that if your body is in survival mode - it helps shut your brain off and turn off the anxiety - something something about studying people that would fall off boats into icy water...\n\nAnyway - I keep a face mask and a face roller in the freezer. When I feel like I'm panicking (like when I got the dreaded, \"let's chat\" meeting request from my boss randomly one day and thought I was getting laid off) - I will pull out the face roller and use it on my face. It does help me calm down. \n\nI did get laid-off that day lol...heh.",

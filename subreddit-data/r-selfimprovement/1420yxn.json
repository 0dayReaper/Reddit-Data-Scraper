Key to confidence is owning who you are it\u2019s not easy I suck at it but your probably better than me so you got this. \nFirst paragraph might\u2019ve missed but this one is it I swear.",

Easier said than done but doable maybe idk again I hate myself and am working on it so idk why I\u2019m trying to give advice. But also check out the book \u201cthe four agreements\u201d I started it today and got halfway through and I got brain damage so I\u2019m slow you could probably read it in a day but it had some cool concepts that I found were helpful just in understanding my self and my own self perception and I think it\u2019ll help with confidence soon but I read it today the shits not magic. But yeah just keep being you and if your \u201cfriends\u201d start to put doubt in your head try to pay attention to where the negativity is coming from a hating ass \u201cfriend\u201d will fuck ya up too. But sometimes you just need to have bad days so the next happy one is happier you\u2019ll get through it just keep your head up. (The head up thing is basic af but it\u2019s still real it\u2019s just about focusing on positivity)",

            "comment": "My friend, you're a baby. You're so young, this dilemma you're having will go away with time. Another thing is that you're in school which honestly sucks the life out of you. Once you're out in the real world, dealing with problems, you yourself will be tempted to build strong values/morals/beliefs. You will be forced to have hobbies, talk to people and give off any energy you want to because you will have the time and energy to focus on everything other than school.\n\n I am glad to hear you've an idea of the kind of person you want to become, it shows you're introspective. Keep holding onto that and keep working on it one day at a time. You will get there. For example, being confident is not something that happens over time it's a slow process. It starts with understanding yourself, forgiving yourself, appreciating yourself and loving yourself. So start small, don't give up and let time do its thing.",

It takes a lot of effort and practice to develop the virtuous side of our humanity but with great efforts come great rewards which are ultimately: peace of mind, self accomplishment and the discovery of your higher self.\n\nWield the power of choice to align your behavior in the right direction on the path of life, choice is a pivot to the balance of the opposites. By making the \u201cright\u201d choices on a daily basis, everything will align itself for you and the doubts will be casted away. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to fail, it will happen inevitably. Failure is the greatest teacher and a necessary component to the learning process that every human undergoes during our lifetime.\n\nHave faith in yourself, live in the moment and be sincere in your intentions to be a good person, things will work out for you.\n\nI have faith in you :)\n\n\u2665\ufe0f",

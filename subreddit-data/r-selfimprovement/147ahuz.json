Are there any other changes you\u2019ve made that have been simple/easy and have improved your life?\n\nFYI - im not trying to say that quitting alcohol is easy. Hope you get my point.",

Going to bed at the same time/getting up at the same time\n3. Exercise in morning before work so it happens daily\n4. Daily meditation\n5. Quitting weed\n\nWith exercise and meditation you can start with super simple short versions (10 pushups a day, 1 minute of deep breathing and done) then increase it over time. The point is start today and keep at it, make it as small as needed to accomplish that. Wishing you all the best!",

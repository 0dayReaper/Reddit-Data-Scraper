    "postText": "I really am trying to improve and take responsibility for myself and my life circumstances. But there are so many factors that are stacked against me with how my life is currently arranged. There are so many things I don't have an ability to affect, and I strangely go back and forth between what I think I am powerless over and I don't understand how my mind flip flops. \n\n\nMy job is exhausting and I receive negative messages that affect my subconscious beliefs about who I am and what I'm capable of. I'm not a sociopath unfortunately, I deeply care about other people's thoughts and feelings and so often internalizing everybody's messages around me. I'm remembering all the things people told me that's wrong with me and feeling like I don't know what is being abused and put under a microscope, and what things I should pay attention to. Even though maybe the way the message was delivered was unacceptable.\n\n\n I Don't believe that anybody intends to harm me, but people still end up having that effect, and I just silence myself because I don't have the leverage or emotional fortitude to deal with people's potential violent communication. This takes away my courage to try new things. \n\n\nI'm bored all day at  my job and so my bored subconscious keeps tossing up the most horrific memories..I assume so that I can reverse engineer what traumatic events caused me to to fall this low, and what of my personal flaws keep me stuck in this job. But it's not working and I don't want to be angry with myself, but I am very frustrated that my brain can't figure out a way to help myself myself suffer less, be safe, and being powered to better my living circumstances and the habits that affect my sense of personal power and leverage.\n\n\nOn my days off from work I am exhausted and want to just do the bare minimum of chores and studying and other than that sleep or watch TV. I got extremely frustrated listening to positive self-improvement type stuff when I'm in my horrible job and then realizing I'm just wasting my time in this job and unable to enact anything I'm hearing about. It's more like I'm fantasizing about other people's lives instead of doing things with my own life. And it is terrifying to acknowledge this is what's going on when I am listening to all this self-improvement stuff when I'm at work. ( I deliver Amazon packages full time).\n\n\nI want to be focused on my goals and positive ideas, but I also don't want to feel frustrated and helpless when I realize I'm just living in fantasyland. How do you strike that balance, and what in the world do you do when you are stuck in a god forsaken job that is not hospitable to all of the self-improvement type things you're trying to do? It's like I'm not improved yet to be eligible for another job, but I'm improved enough to be extremely dissatisfied with the type of life I'm currently able to have. And I just come back to being angry at myself and the world and individual people who I was harmed by and they never cared, and just existence in general. For even being this situation to start with, and feeling helpless and to depressed to take positive actions. \n\n\nSorry for this rant but I'm taking a break at work and just crying and overwhelmed with this predicament. If any of this sounds familiar to your own experiences, I really would benefit from your insights about what helped you get out of exhaustion of this mental cycle and circumstantial cycle.",

Your ability to take a situation, analyze it, and respond to it with such precision, to be so effective with your communication, gentle, selfless and caring, yet so powerful and influential. I know this isn't what you're looking for in this post, but I just had to expressed how blown away I am at how brilliant your mind works. \nYou have a talent for this. I'd love to know if you have a blog or if you've written any books. Reading your words inspire what has died in me years ago, reanimated the metaphorical pulse of a person who is practically dead inside.",

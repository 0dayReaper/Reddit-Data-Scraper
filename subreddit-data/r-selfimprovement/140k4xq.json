Life happens, failures are inevitable, relationships don\u2019t work, your diet falls apart, friendships go sideways, you fall short on goals, etc. \n\nOther than thinking what went wrong to learn your lessons, there\u2019s literally 0 benefit in living in the past\u2026It will only make you feel shame and anxiety about moving forward :) \n\nEspecially in today social-media-digital-era, it\u2019s really easy to get lost in online feeds and fall for the narrative of \u201cthese people are so perfect, I wish I had there life\u201d. When I\u2019m reality, most social media feeds are just highlight reels. Don\u2019t compare yourself to others, just work on yourself :) \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m still working on handling rejection better, because I\u2019m very share when it comes to hitting on woman. I\u2019m always worrying about what strangers might say / react before I say what\u2019s up \u2014 I guess that\u2019s just another thing I can work on! \n\nAlso, meditation, inner-work like journaling, and writing music (especially with lyrics, has helped me learn to love my self like my best-friend would, rather than judge my self heavily. \n\nWhat do you guys think? How have you learned to give yourself more grace and be less hard on yourself over the years? \n\nBe goal-oriented and strive to be better every day! But don\u2019t beat yourself up when life inevitably plays mean jokes on you\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",

I'm a creature of discipline at this point so far as my diet, strategizing, exercise and overall goal oriented habits go.  I think one of the most useful skills to continue consistency is to be okay with those things you mentioned happening even after you've experienced a meaningful period where you were \"on the ball\" and in that zone of virtually effortless productivity/positivity.  The important thing is that after being in that state, you now are aware of when you feel to be sliding back to the old personality, and can better monitor yourself and replace blame for accountability.  So that's what I do, replace blame for accountability and I find I can easily self correct .",

I just ended a 3 year relationship and have been kicking myself and regretting my choice even though it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about for a while. But your post made me realize what\u2019s done is done and I just need to stop kicking myself and having negative thoughts and regret. We all need to be kinder to ourselves and that can start from approaching our issues/low points/mistakes/etc. with a \u201chow can this help me level up so I can support my future self while loving my current self\u201d perspective. Sorry if this became a ramble but your post opened a new door in my head and made my lonely day a bit better. Thank you",

Now you feel terrible.\n\nLet's take the same thing, and instead of listening to your inner critical voice, use your inner hype man: \"Hey, you did your best! That's awesome! You didn't get the thing (or whatever) but you did your best. Next time you face this challenge, try xyz instead! You've got this!\"\n\nAnd so on. \n\nI am a survivor of child abuse. My parents are monsters. I'm 50, and until I was in my late 40s, I *constantly* heard my father's voice mocking me whenever I tried something new. It took a LOT of practice and mindfulness to recognize when that piece of shit is trying to speak inside my head, so I can stiff arm the voice away and listen to the hype man, *who has always been there for me*.\n\nI feel like this oversimplifies it, but I hope it's helpful.",

I really appreciate it, and honestly, I applied your advice the other day after hearing it. \n\nIt\u2019s almost like challenging your inner critique, and spinning the intent to motivate you rather than tear you down.

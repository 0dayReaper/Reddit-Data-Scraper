    "postText": "School and drivers ed ended for me last week. I was out doing stuff from like 7 am to 7 pm everyday. I have had a lot more free time recently and when I was busy I'd imagine myself being a lot more productive when being freed up. I go to work and the gym and that's really it. Other than that I'm just hanging out at home just doing stuff to pass the time until I go to the work or gym. I think I am so used to having a strict schedule handed to me of what to do that I can't create my own things to do. The simple answer I think is just to go out and have fun/explore what's nearby. Any advice is appreciated on what you think would be right to do.",

Maybe you would enjoy doing so with other people and not alone, and that is what is preventing you from doing it? Or maybe sometimes you want to be relaxed indoors and learning about whatever random things you don't have to force yourself to do because you just find it interesting, and it lets you connect to people. I admire that you have a strict schedule and make sure you get to the gym. That is something I want to do, but I am not motivated to do it alone.",

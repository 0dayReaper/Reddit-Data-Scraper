    "postText": "I don't even know how to phrase what I have to say and my thoughts/questions over here are going to be really messy so bear with me. \n\nI have been facing 2 probelms all my life and I think they are slowly making me lose myself and get depressed. I imagine myself hiding somewhere dark and small. Like even when I am alone, I want to hide. idek from what. It is to the point of imagining myself dying. (Passive suicide ideation).   \n\n\nFor context, I am a 23 year old female living in Asia.   \n\n\n*  I don't know what I am doing with my life. \n   * I am graduating soon with a bachelor's in engineering but I am not able to find a job. \n   * My days mostly consist of reading books or being on social media for hours on end. I am not doing anything productive or even learning anything new and it has been like that for a long time now. Its like I am just wasting time. \n   * And to top it off, I have a twin brother who is extremely smart and is always doing something productive or learning something new. Its like he has a goal in life and I don't. (which is true. right now i don't think i have a goal in life. )   \n\n* Body image / self-confidence and every issue related to self. \n   * I have been overweight my whole life. (89kgs when I was 17) And I did lose like 17kgs in 2019. But after that, I have been on a Yo-yo journey with my weight going up and down. I am back to 88kgs now. (I gained 12kgs in a year) \n   * All of this has been really overwhelming for me and now I have a problem of binge eating. And after I do that, I end up hating myself and wanting to kms. \n   * I don't feel comfy in my own body and always want to hide myself. When I go to sleep I imagine sinking into the bed and basically want to be under the bed (It is a bed box kind of thing. Like a small dark room)\n\nI really want to know what I can do to help myself with these things. People say be consistent/motivated but it is always so hard. What can I do to help me? How do I go about at least being comfortable and love at least one thing about myself?",

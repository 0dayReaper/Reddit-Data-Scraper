    "postText": "Or alternatively, how can I stop being such a little bitch?\n\nPeople keep calling me \u2018too nice\u2019, and even though that sounds like a compliment, most of the time people say it when I miss an opportunity/give an opportunity away, or suck up to others.\n\nFor example, one time I was with my friends friends and we were catching replacement buses back home (trains were not operating due to construction) and while everyone was pushing to get inside the bus (including my friends) I let some teenagers on before me. Anyway, that almost made me unable to get on the bus entirely because it was very packed at that point. Thank God my friends weren\u2019t too annoyed, but they kept telling me I needed to \u2018stop being nice\u2019.\n\nAnother example is at work, we had a very rude customer who was verbally abusive towards us. I just felt like I wanted to get away from the situation, so I just got her whatever she wanted and didn\u2019t argue or try to explain anything. She eventually calmed down and left, but then my coworkers said I was being too nice to her. \n\nI don\u2019t know :\u2019^(. I just hate conflict because obviously, it\u2019s uncomfortable. But I hate it even more that I\u2019ve never been able to stand up for myself and go silent every time I come across these kinds of situations. It\u2019s like I\u2019m programmed to never stand up for myself.\n\nAaaaaanyway - any advice? Thanks!",

Help yourself before you help others. \n\nDeep inside are you coming from the place of strength or from the place of weakness?\n\nAlso be you. Don\u2019t worry what the others are saying. Nothing wrong with being nice and thoughtful and make sure that younger people can catch the ride home. \n\nAlso nothing wrong with not arguing with toxic person at work. Why would you. You just should come from place where you know that you are doing the right thing because this is who you are and you don\u2019t have problem with that. \n\nBe comfortably you and make sure it comes from place of strength.",

    "postText": "I don't know why we fool ourselves into thinking everyone can, when some people will just fail. At life. Some of us are just human waste\n\nI do believe that as there many people out there with the possibility of turning their lives for good, there are equally people who are just doomed for life. I am one of them, who have struggle to accept this, and used to believe many things just like the ideas shared in this subreddit. I know that all my efforts are going to be in vain, why keep trying at all?. If time and time again, I keep failing, I better not bother with it anymore.\n\n Everyone tells you that you will reap what you sow,  but I have had goals that I wanted to meet but the benefits reaped weren't worth all of the effort you have to put in. One dissapointment after another should tell you something, to me it's to stop, While trying you realize what you are (loser, pathetic, weakling) your self-esteemed is destroyed in the process. What is the point when I will never be happy, all the techniques, habits, and strategies can't save everyone. \n\n\nsome of you may think that this mean I will waste my life away, but I am wasting my life away anyways, trying or not trying to be better, I am so much behind in life I prefer to just wait for my death. In the hypothetical situation that you knew that you had certain time left to live, you wouldn't be minding your habits, whether you exercised or read wouldn't be important. What would be different if that time was one week vs 3 month?. Nothing, it applies if it is 5 months, 5 years, or 50. Success is not guaranteed in life but death is, I will gladly accept her and stop being stubborn and resign myself as a lost cause. It is mean to happen, in the world there is healthy or unhealthy, rich and poor, intelligent and dumb, and successful and uncesuccessful people.\n\nThis isn't a vent, it is truth.",

When NASA told Elon Musk it's impossible to build a rocket that can be sent into space, return to earth, land and be used again, did he shrug his shoulders and think \"ah well\"? Nope\n\nHe went and figured out how to do it... Why?\n\nBecause he thought he could. You have to change your thoughts before anything else will change. What you think, you become. Buddhists have known this for 2600 years! Modern psychology only caught up to this in the last 60 years but it is true.\n\nThe whole \"I think so because I've seen it's true\" is a limiting belief that comes from you observing something without trying to change it.\n\nProve me wrong.",

So can I ask what goal do you think people are \u201cfailing\u201d in mass? \n\nIt seems like you\u2019re talking about a \u201cgood life\u201d but what does that even constitute? \n\nIf all you want are certain circumstances then no wonder, your goals aren\u2019t your to get for sure, but fear not because thats not the only reason to do stuff! \n\nIn reality it seems you have a crisis of values and you think your assessment is \u201ctruth\u201d. \n\nI have a question, would you walk up to someone and say that to their face? \u201cYou\u2019re just human waste\u201d. Could you really do that? If not to another then why yourself? \n\nYou have all these assumptions about where you\u2019re \u201csupposed to be\u201d that you can\u2019t really consider that you\u2019re hear because that\u2019s where your supposed to be based on everything you currently understand? \n\nIf a horse can\u2019t jump there\u2019s no way it\u2019s getting out of its fence and you being corralled in what \u201cmakes sense\u201d your just trapped in the same cage. What you lack is perspective because then you\u2019d see how easily it can be to strut out of this \u201cpen\u201d.\n\nIn reality you can learn a new view if you are humble enough to admit you don\u2019t know.",

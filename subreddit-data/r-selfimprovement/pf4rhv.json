I haven\u2019t heard (read, rather) any in so long\n\nDoing a push-up is hard for me since, well, I\u2019m well overweight\n\nSo for every upvote this gets, I\u2019ll do a push up.\n\nYes I know its \u201ccheap\u201d to do it like that, to ask for internet points to be motivated, but I can\u2019t go outside. I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to, not even a friend, so just seeing that little arrow that shows someone cares means the world to me.",

Used to only be able to do 2-4 pushups, basically took my whole body strength but couldn't increase the number of pushups.\nI accidentally came across a youtuber, and he suggested that instead of doing normal pushups, try improving your core strength first by doing easy to hard pushups. First try doing wall pushups, then inclined pushups, really inclined pushups, knee pushups and finally normal pushups.\nThis is of course after trying one type for a few days once you have mastered it. I'm sorry I'm not able to explain it properly. You can see Hybrid Calistenics 'How to do more pushups' video on YouTube. Very informative. Really helped me improve. This is not a promotion btw, I am just sharing a video which helped me at my hour of need. Peace!",

Work your way up every day until you reach about 50 reps per set. Lower the angle by using a table, work your way up, but to a smaller number, like 40 reps. Lower angle, repeat. Do knee push-ups (25 reps), and finally normal push-ups. Do them slow and watch your form. Better to do less and slow but with proper form, than fast and sloppy.\n\nIf you start by doing a lot right of the bat you're going to injure yourself and train inefficiently. You've got to give time for your body to recover. Each time you recover, your muscle gets built stronger.\n\nHowever, if you're overweight and want to get in shape, exercise alone won't do it. You can't outrun your fork. Have a look at calory counting and read about proper ways of doing it. You want to get proper nutrition.\n\nIt's a long process (we're talking months or years), so the hard part is to stay consistent. Rome wasn't built in a day. Good luck!",

Which I assume is what you're interested in.\n\nI've tried in the past to be more aggressive and structureless about the way I went about building strength, and the results were slower and didn't last long.\n\nTracking your progress in an app (something like FitNotes or Progression) can be really motivating, as you can see yourself slowly getting better. Make sure you're getting the right amount of nutrients for your height / age, and above all: be consistent and be patient.",

What you\u2019re doing and what you\u2019ve stated already shows you have the strength to peer around the hurdle, and that\u2019s the best start. Good luck to you!",

Time went by like seconds.\n\nNow you have nothing to do, nothing to strive.\n\nThis is against human nature.\n\nSet yourself a long term goal worth fighting for, no matter how \"realistic\" you think this is or not.\n\nRule of thumb: You can reach 99.999% of anything someone else managed to already archive and usually there is even much more things that you could reach just by believing in it.\n\nRead the following quote from Tony Robbins website about the **Bannister Effect**:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Consider Roger Bannister. For centuries, it was believed that running a 4-minute mile was physically impossible. But Roger Bannister shattered that myth. How did he do it?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Roger didn\u2019t just go out and physically practice, he made a mental shift as well. He practiced, over and over in his head. He envisioned himself breaking that 4-minute barrier. Because he knew that no matter how much he trained his body, if he was going to get the result he wanted, he had to change his mental state first. He conditioned himself to become so certain that he was capable of achieving this feat, that he believed he would do it with every fiber of his being.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After Roger Bannister ran that 4-minute mile, within just two years, 37 people also ran a 4-minute mile. And remember, no one in history had ever done that before.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is the power of imagery training \u2013 of visualizing the results over and over, as if it had already happened.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Tony Robbins =&gt; THE POWER OF MENTAL CONDITIONING\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou need a long term, worthy\u00b3 goal and the mindset of naively trusting that it's reachable, no matter what.\n\nNow you actually have something that interests you, what makes you excited and enjoy every day where you can research and find more about how to reach your goal(s).\n\nEvery day you do a tiny inch of progress and summing up every little inch, you eventually reach a mile and summing up that miles, without even noticing, you accidently surpassed your goal(s) and have to find even bigger ones!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u00b3 worthy **FOR YOU**. Not your Mom, Dad, Sister, Best friend, Relationship partner, your teacher, your boss, a random dude on the internet, your gang, whatever. It should be worthy for YOU. If you as a man think that being the most beautiful woman is a worthy goal.. then go for it! And don't ever dare to start with \"But this is not possible..\". As long as you haven't tried literally EVERY available options, you can't say if it's possible or not and also don't dare to start with \"I tried everything..\", no you 99.999% haven't tried everything. Don't give up, change your mindset and start using \"How\". \"How can I make this happen?\", \"How can I still reach my goals?\", \"How can I overcome XYZ?\"",

When I went through my episode, I felt like there was no end in sight, but there was even though it took time. The best advice I can give you, is telling you the two things that helped me. One was prayer and offering the depression to God. I never expected Him to take it from me, but I did anticipate Him sitting in the darkness with me. This gave me purpose, like my suffering was not in vain. The second thing that helped me was consistency. Somedays I could do more, but I committed myself to two tasks a day until I could handle more. You decide what they are for you, but health is all interconnected. If we don't sleep well, it affects appetite. Appetite affects mood and so forth. Maybe one of your goals is journaling out how you feel and making a gratitude list. Just know whatever you decide, you are strong and you can make it through this darkness.",

I did this amount yesterday and 1 more is NOTHING!\".\n\nAfter you're done with push-ups you have: squats, crunches, pull-ups (divide by 20) and so on.\n\nBonus points if you never go down a number, always maintain the same or increase.\n\nGood luck!",

You're basically Hansel and Greteling your way out of bed.\n\nIf you need to wake up for a class or something or you like early mornings etc. You can place the alarm clock just outside the reach from your bed.\n\nNext day or whenever you feel like it go for a cooling glass or water that wakes you up real good.\n\nThen I like to drink coffee on the couch till I feel like getting up and doing stuff even if it's just watching TV, solving jigsaw puzzles, sewing things and most importantly petting your pets if you have any. \n\nI was feeling down lately and will probably continue to do so until my thesis defence and thanks to your post I remembered that we're not alone in this hole alone no matter how much we feel like it and it's okay to acknowledge this and that gives us the next step of taking action. Thank you for reminding me what makes me feel good. By sharing these with you I get to see what I can do to get out of this pit. Hope we can catch up later feeling better. Cheers!",

And \"I am\" by William Hollis. \nAlso there is something called positive activation. It's when you make a commitment to do something using the theory that it takes 21 days to form a habit. Walking/exercise helps improve the symptoms and severity of depression. \nCommit to walking 5kns  or miles. But instead of starting at 5kms or miles just commit to putting on joggers an walking to the letterbox for the first week. Then make it it to end of the street. Then around the block. \nWrite down goals and how to achieve them. \nBreak them down into hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly. \nAnd if you think you need meds to help boost your mood go see a mental health specialist GP. \nNothing changes if nothing changes so make the changes you need to make your life better :)",

It\u2019s hard living with depression, I\u2019ve lived with it for years. I still live with it today. Some days are harder than others. But I keep trying\n\nI keep trying for the people I love. I keep trying because I want to enjoy my life. I keep trying because, like you said, I want to function as a normal human being. \n\nSo keep trying OP. Keep trying every day and understand that trying is the best we can do.\n\nAlso, forgive me for the unsolicited advice, but if push ups are hard, no one is going to mock you with starting off doing wall push ups or assisted push ups (girl push ups as they\u2019re commonly called but this implies women are weak, that isn\u2019t true) to begin until you get to doing full push ups\n\nI\u2019m rooting for you OP.

This is the thing that changed everything for me! I took a partnered dancing class, then kept going every week, I now know people there, I now have 3 new people I can talk weekly, from this class alone, then I took a theatre class, and then ice skating classes, then I started more classes, and im always on the hunt for more hobbies to do!, I do this not to take away from yourself, but to go people can change!\n\nIn highschool, I took theatre classes after school!, and I was also part of the chess club, I actually wish I took up way more hobbies, and even a sports team, there was stuff I wanted to do but I was too scared to do so, so please if you go you're scared to try something, then just do it anyways, and I know its so much easier said then done.\n\nI know personally I am not the most active in terms of messages, but if you do need someone so you can reach out to and say I want to try this hobby but I am scared, just let me know, I can defs spend the time telling you to try it! (I however cannot act as any sort of emotional support other then that, and I do apologise for that!)\n\nGood luck /u/CrowdedPianoBench",

Despite whatever differences in ideology we have, one thing in common we have is that both of us and everyone on this Earth is blessed with life from God and that\u2019s enough for me to Love you. Life can get real dark sometimes and smother you in sadness and grief, but Life is similar to a video game in the sense that nothing would be appreciated and satisfying if it were all given to you/placed in your lap, like a video game with all possible cheats installed. The process, the process of life, of failure, of trying, of re-evaluating, of success. Is what makes life a beautiful thing. God gave you free will to have the choice to choose him and live in line with the Truth. The Truth will set you free. The concept of love does not exist without free will. Frank Turek and askcliffe are sound resources to build a solid foundation in this world. A foundation that even depression nor tragedy can break through. Romans 5:3-5",

Find purpose absent of others.\n\nYou are suffering from depression. This isn\u2019t normal, (normal given your circumstances, abnormal in general) to fix this abnormality is extremely difficult. It is worth investing in a professional to help you help yourself to get out of the rut in your life.\n\n(Look up on YouTube \u201cbetter ideas how to get out of a rut\u201d great video)\n\nDon\u2019t expect to get out in one go mate. Make sure you compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to the avatars that you invent of others. If you are better then who you were yesterday, today was a good day. What did you do to make today a good day? If you are worse of then who you were yesterday, where did you go wrong and how can you fix it?\n\n(Those a re the words of Simon Sinek, my favourite life coach)\n\nGood luck\n\nRepost: had to remove links :/",

I\u2019m stress eating over a pack of chewing gum a day. However, I\u2019ve started going for hour long walks everyday. This is an ounce of discipline in my life and it\u2019s the first step.

Now get up and awaken that beast inside that you\u2019ve kept away for so long. Strive for your goals, look at it like this. Your already at the bottom, where do u go from here? Use your common logic if your already so down the only way is up. Work on your self take it one step at a time , can\u2019t take a step? Crawl. \n\nStart by fixing your sleep pattern since that contributes a lot, once you fix tbat you\u2019ll find your self having way much time, then u can use your head to figure what to do with that time with the little motivation and energy your getting from your good night sleep annnnddd that\u2019s how u get the ball morning my brother. \n\nAll the best brother, May Allah guide you.",

Hell, say it 5 times! and know that this is another person saying it. Now join in. Me AND you telling you that you\u2019re amazing. You might not believe that yet but I sure do! And I hope future you will begin to see what I see; a human with the strength to try. \nYou\u2019re someone I feel across this vast planet and I know that you are worth it, I believe in you and I want you to know that I care about you. \nThings have happened to you that have brought you to where you are, and that\u2019s ok because you\u2019re pushing to get better and that to me is someone with great strength. You are strong and I applaud you for pushing. And tomorrow you\u2019ll push yourself again knowing we care. And if tomorrow you need rest, you rest yourself knowing we care and that you\u2019ll be ready when rested. \nTake each day one at a time and thank yourself at the beginning and end, knowing that we love you, believe in you and know how much you\u2019re worth. \n\nPeople care about you and I hope that one day you will feel that same way too. \n\nI\u2019m still trying this myself, let\u2019s fight together. \n\nWish you all the best my friend and congratulations for committing to change. It takes an unworldly strength to make that effort, and that is some otherworldly superpower.",

I start university on 27th September, still got my enrolment to do and a big dissertation is waiting for me when I get back. Life is bleak but its encouraging to hear someone else going through a similiar mundane feeling situation. Also exercise, that's challenging when depressed so don't feel too hard on yourself, make small strives at a time.",

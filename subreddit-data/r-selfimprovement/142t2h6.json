    "postText": "Since I was a kid I have always been a high achiever for some reason I don\u2019t know why I had straight A, after school student in, \nCollege courses on weekends, and did band after school because I think I was a perfectionist (I guess I wanted to be great in other people eyes like my parents and didn\u2019t do the things I wanted for myself to make myself happy). Plus my dad and I\u2019m his side of the family seem like promoters of higher ed as there nurses and engineers and my dad suggest I get the masters in SLP because if the stable and money to survive \n\nIn college I had did the major speech therapy as I have a stutter myself and pursued it. But I also pursued it because it was a stable career and I would live comfortable with it. U have to get a masters to be a speech pathologist but I did not have e motivation to pursue it as I was not really interested in it to go full through and I didn\u2019t want to regret doing it plus loans and all that too much debt. \n\nFor some reason I\u2019m my life before I die god forbid I think I do want to pursue a master in general just to say I did it and accomplished something if the feat. \n\nBut I\u2019m not interested in speech therapy that\u2019s off the list, I looked into social work seems stressful and too much for me . I had saw art therapy which is really interesting as I love to sketch and paint plus I do like helping ppl to some extent.\n\nBut in this life time do I need/want to pursue a masters? I\u2019m on a journey to self discovery and I need to determine what success and happiness means to me. \n\nI had always wanted to be great pursue higher ed in someway because I had seen education as the best way to go a four life the rt way and u dint have to struggle.\n\nI\u2019m 24 I dint want to not regret getting my master s\u2026then I\u2019m 40 look back and say I didn\u2019t why I didn\u2019t get my masters when I\u2019m younger.\n\nI\u2019m such a indecisive person I guess wait it out for next couple of years and see what\u2019s best for me",

I went to a community college &amp; transferred to a university but i never finished bc my parents got divorced but i do want to go back. just do whatever makes you happy &amp; keep trying to find what works best. my major was social work, i love talking to people. right now i\u2019m working in production but i don\u2019t mind it. there are ppl that have got multiple degrees to find what is their true passion but you\u2019re right just wish college wasn\u2019t so expensive \ud83d\ude2d. at the end of the day you\u2019ll be ok!!",

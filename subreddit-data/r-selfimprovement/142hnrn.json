    "postText": "Previous year had went into serious Depression. This year also had some instances of the same. I have been going through loops that where should I invest my life in. With in the income of AI, am more confused on how to go about my life. Have lost interest in most things in life. Don't see if there i anything worthwhile to get up in the morning for. \n\nDon't know how to rebuild my life, as I have lost direction and will in life. Many times seems lost, but sometimes in volunteering I find myself. Rest is just delusions and thinking. I just have no idea how will I even operate in this life. I don't like meeting people as they see it as their waste of time as well. \n\nJust overwhelmed by events happening around the world don't know how to get things straight. How to form relationships, to take care of health, grow my skills. Life seems to be too complicated and I have messed up a lot. Also due the depression my memory seems not to be working as it is supposed to. Just don't know how to go about this as time is just running out and my will is very low.",

    "postText": "So I just moved into a new city for an internship and don't really know too many people here. I have been going around and doing a lot in the city by myself to get to know the city. However, I have a feeling that I want to talk about what I have been up to, to some other people. I did talk to my close friends(on the other side of the country) a few days ago and that made me feel better. Now that I've done more things here, I want to talk even more about what I did to them. This requirement to talk to other people and make connection is making my time in the city alone worse. What can I do to improve this? I have tried to make some friends here but that's a very gradual process.",

    "postText": "There\u2019s a lot of talk about how being \u201ceasy to work with\u201d is an underrated skill. However, one of the top tips for this category is to say \u201cyes\u201d to your co-workers/manager. \n\nThat\u2019s great and all, but how are we supposed to establish boundaries for work without being labeled \u201cdifficult to work with?\u201d \n\nThe instance prompting this post is scope creep. I\u2019m being continuously asked to do more than what my current scope is, after a retainer cut due to budget problems. I\u2019ve permitted a few smaller items to make their way through in an effort to be easy to work with. However, the manager asked me to take on a huge responsibility that would require a lot of work (and no additional pay or reduction of responsibilities elsewhere), which I declined and it\u2019s been cold waters ever since. \n\nWhile I suspect that the manager in question is toxic (there are other signs), I\u2019m interested in hearing more about the issue of balancing between boundaries and understanding your value vs being considered difficult to work with. \n\nI would love to hear your insights and thoughts! \n\nPS. I\u2019m in a male-dominated industry.",

            "comment": "Employers and employees are by definition in a tension of \"motivation to extract all free work possible.\" It can't be escaped, but some bosses remember that their employees are people too and push back on the organization when it asks too much. Your boss shouldn't take it personally that you stood up for yourself. It's good of you to set those boundaries because we are the only person who always has a chance to advocate for ourselves, and when we give in over and over again it creates regret and despondency. \n\nThis is your life, you can try to enjoy it or you can decide not to. You did the right thing.",

    "postText": "Hi, if anyone is willing to take the time to read this, I really appreciate it and any advice you can send my way.\n\nI\u2019m 20f, I recently had a pretty bad early-life crisis that resulted in a manic episode, dropping out of college (through academic disqualification), getting admitted to the hospital, and now the position I\u2019m at in life now.\n\nI don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license or prior work experience.  I don\u2019t have the money or means for reliable transportation to get a job.  I am living with my mother who is working full-time.\n\nMy current responsibilities consist of taking care of the house and our pets.\n\nLately I\u2019ve been really depressed, I\u2019m not suicidal at all, just genuinely having a hard time getting on my feet and I don\u2019t even know where to start.\n\nI\u2019m stuck in a limbo-like state of wanting a purpose in my life but not knowing where or how to start.\n\nI\u2019m interested in possibly doing an online program to get a BS in Psychology, maybe finding work through my mother\u2019s job (drug rehab).  However, I\u2019m really scared about furthering the debt I\u2019m in and I\u2019m worried my academic disqualification will prevent me from being eligible to enroll in any online programs.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in attending a campus anytime soon, the social aspect of it is a big part of why my first semester in college resulted in a major downfall.  I just can\u2019t stand being ostracized and forced into awkward group-projects anymore.\n\nI don\u2019t have any sort of routine, my days consist mostly of sitting around the house, taking care of the pets, and trying to keep myself occupied with playing video games, watching yt, and drawing/painting.\n\nI\u2019m out of shape, I\u2019m underweight, unproductive, tired all of the time.  I\u2019m really sick of living like this and need help climbing out of this rut I dug for myself.\n\nAgain, I really appreciate if anyone took the time to read this, and I\u2019m all ears for any suggestions and ideas being tossed my way.  Thank you. :)",

Try using the Forfeit app as a way to hold yourself accountable and stay motivated. It's a cool app where you set tasks and if you don't send an evidence completing them, you lose some money. It adds a bit of extra motivation to get things done!\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, consider exploring new hobbies or activities that interest you. It could be anything from painting to playing an instrument or even trying out a new sport. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to find the perfect purpose right away. Just try different things and see what brings you joy and fulfillment.",

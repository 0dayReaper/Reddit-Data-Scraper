Even when I know nothing is wrong I\u2019m constantly almost searching and expecting bad to happen ruining my entire day. Nothing I do is fun anymore and I don\u2019t feel like I love anything or anyone like I should. My greatest hobbies and goals and the most important people in my life feel horrible to me and saying that even out loud makes me feel like a horrible person.\n\nI\u2019m a constant ticking time bomb that doesn\u2019t know what to do or how to fix themselves and it hate it I really hate it and even with all the people in my life I feel alone\u2026 and sad\u2026 and miserable and just fucking angry.\n\nIf anyone could give me advice I would love that but I just don\u2019t know what can help at this point because I\u2019ve tried for literally years and nothing has helped and it\u2019s all getting worse",

It literally changed my life. I now do body building types of exercise and my OCD is still at bay. \n\nIt seems that using my body to show myself I have the power to progress, ie lift heavier or run faster shows me that I can be in control of my life, mentally and physically :-)\n\nMy advice would be to start small and do it with others. Even going once a week may boost your self esteem and mood. Also writing down how you feel after doing this sort of thing may help in recognising if it's a positive thing for you. Good Luck",

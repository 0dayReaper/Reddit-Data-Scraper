And he said that I was very lucky then to have her. I realized, yes I am so lucky and grateful to have had her in my life, and I think eventually that will be how I feel about her memory. \n\nRight now it\u2019s so painful and I miss her so much. But I know eventually it won\u2019t hurt so much. I think I have to remind myself that I was so lucky to have her in the first place. \n\nI do hope that she continues to look after me in some way like she did in life. I\u2019m trying not to cry so much because I don\u2019t want to feel the pain, so I\u2019m trying to keep myself busy. But I think at least some crying is inevitable. \n\nSorry for the long reply but thank you again for taking the time to make your kind response.",

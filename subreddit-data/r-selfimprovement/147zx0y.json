    "postText": "I honestly don't know where to start from and how to summarize this without jumping from topic to topic but I'll try dividing it into paragraphs or something.\n\nFirst off, college. After all these misserable years of education due to not fitting in or just being hated by everyone for no reason and having to listen through everything with an attention span so terrible I can't even explain it, I finally got to college. Have in mind, this is my second year but the first year I spent on a totally different college due to pressure from my parents. I'm really interested in the stuff that I'm learning and doing here and would love to continue with it but the problem is that due to all those awful years, and especially the one spent on a college I was tehnically forced to go to, I kind of completely lost the will to study and alongside my previously mentioned practically non existent attention span, I have extremely hard time studying. It's not even that there are courses that I don't like. I like all of them (some more than others) but no matter what I do, I can't concentrate. I've mentioned the attention span thing to my parents since it's a huge problem and doesn't only apply to college stuff (and previously schoolwork) but it extends to all parts of my life. It literally destroys me because I can't sit and concentrate on anything for longer than a minute. Already expecting some people to mention that it might be due to my usage of electronics but honestly, at the moment I'm using electronics the least that I've been using them in past 8 years probably and the attention span thing is at the worst.\n\nHaving said all that, you could have assumed I have really bad time passing my exams. It's taking a mental tall on me and my parents. They are also pressuring me and telling me that they'll stop funding my education of I don't pass. It's just really demotivating because essentially, they think it's a form of encouragement while I view it as them giving up on me even more. I believe they gave up on me a bit when I switched to the college I'm at now because they wanted me to go that other college.\n\nDuring that other college, at first I though well I could get through it. I didn't enjoy it but I thought I could probably do well. Then I started thinking about my future. I imagined myself doing the job I was preparing for and something just clicked and I lost all hope for myself. There's also a hole story behind it that I have to explain because it's the reason it made me so misserable. So mu dad went to this IT college and since I was always good at math, my mum always said that I should go there from when I was very young. Of course, I didn't understand any of it as a kid and I accepted it and understood it as a thing that I should do because I had no other option. Fast forward into high school (btw I'm from a smaller European country with a very stupid school system, just wanted to mention so that you don't get confused by some things), I started to realise that I'll have to go to IT and it didn't really have the best effect on me. The last year of high school here, we prepare for the tests at the end of the year (they're somewhat similar to British GCSEs) and after that you pick colleges you want to go to. Due to COVID, me not really getting along anymore with people I got along with before and some other stuff, I got really depressed. The whole year we were speaking about the colleges we wanted to go to and only then I realised that I can actually choose what I wanted to go to. I was so happy to realise it but of course my parents were disappointed that I wanted to go to something else. They asked what I was doing with my life and that I won't achieve anything. A sentance that I'll always remember is: \"you have to think about how you are going to feed your children.\" I was pressured into going to that college and it made me even more depressed than before. I did terribly on the tests. My parents were furious. I could still get into a college that similar to the one I wanted to go to but they didn't want to hear about it because again, they didn't want me to go there and it was in a different city. The problem was that I also didn't get into the college they wanted me to go to so instead, they paid large amounts of money for me to go to that college. I never asked them to not did I want to but they insisted on it. They were willing to pay so much money for me to go to college I knew I would be misserable at. Anyway, I went to it for a year and it was awful. I met some good friends but other than that, it was terrible. They were disappointed in me when I said that I wanted to switch and my mum was surprised that because she somehow taught that the IT college is where I wanted to go even though I have stated the opposite so many times. \nI also wanted to mention that after was pressured into going to the IT college, my mum kept telling people that my decision was such a beautiful change of heart and a revaletion above everything. In reality, I remember exactly what it was. We were going back from the city and for 40 minutes straight, she was talking sh*t about the field that interested me even though she knows less than nothing about it. It was mental torture that made me choose the IT college, not a beautiful revalation.\n\nAs I said, I found a group of friends while on the IT college. However, because I moved to a different college and all of them went in their different ways (but stayed in the same city) we don't really hang out anymore. I thought that at this new college I won't find many good friends, but in actuality, I probably hang out and talk to more people that I ever did in my entire life. I love it here and it seems like people are starting to enjoy my company. There is a problem though. Because of my previous experiences, I'm in a state of mind in which due to my previous experiences, I believe that they are all going to abandon me or that they are all acting like they enjoy spending time with me just out of decency. I feel like most of them don't like me at all even though they also approach me because it's just hardwired into my mind.\n\nAnd lastly I'll talk a bit about my mental state (yes, there's more). So as I said, I've had really bad problems with depression for a few years now. It was so bad I did self harm (I cut myself in places where people couldn't see the cuts due to clothes) and gained quite a bit of weight. I also started drinking excessively and getting wasted pretty badly. I've drank so much that people started telling me they're surprised I'm still alive or that I didn't go to the hospital for alcohol poisoning. I contemplated committing suicide and almost did it a few times. I ultimately decided not to because I got the idea that life is meaningless and if it is, so is everything that comes after it.\n\nI've also had really big problems with emotions. Not that I was too emotional but the exact opposite. I was always very emotionless. It was just the I was. And in recent years I started to not allow myself to feel anything. I have not allowed myself to be happy or sad or anything. It lead to me hurting a few people and not even realising it. I also realized that I don't really understand differences between good and bad. I believe it was due to isolation and all that.\n\nThat would be almost everything I guess. There's much more to it that what I mentioned but this is the most important stuff. It might seem pathetic for a 20-year-old to have problems like this. Also I just wanted to vent a bit. I'm not really asking any of you for help although it would be helpful if anyone said anything.\nAlso, I apologise for my english. As I said, I'm not a native speaker so I don't know if I worded this well.\nTake care.",

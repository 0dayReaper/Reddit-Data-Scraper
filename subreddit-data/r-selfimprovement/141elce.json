Maybe you will use whatever you learn about or enjoy on YouTube, Reddit the internet, etc as a way to connect with friends and then feel less lonely that way? Maybe it's not how long you're using YouTube, but rather whatever you are engaging with on YouTube in the internet. I use a lot of YouTube and in part it relieves anxiety of being alone and in part it is filling up my boredom and relieving my stress. So I see it as an excellent tool in the midst of shitty circumstances. It's definitely superior to using drugs, which is what people of the past would do. I used to have a lifestyle where I didn't have the impulse to use YouTube super often because I was enjoying my everyday life, It was super engaging and involved. problem solving and really using my brain",

So you can set it to send a screenshot of your screentime with Youtube on less than 2 hours per day, for example, or you lose $10. It works really well for me and i hope it can help you as well!",

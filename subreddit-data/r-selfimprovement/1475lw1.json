    "postText": "Since was a young child I was constantly compared to others by my family and parents, im terms of behaviours, academics, achievements. I always felt like the failure was potrayed as so accepted and embraced it. Fast forward now, im 27 M and really started focusing on self improvement in every aspect, I have come such a long way but subconsciously in the back of my mind compare myself to others constantly and it holds me back. I compare my height to others (im relatively short (172cm) in an averagly tall country), my looks, my social abilities, my education, my confidence, my communication skills.. the list goes on and on. But ultimately project these insecurities on how others feel about me, mainly my girlfriend. im sure she loves me for more than these things as love her but this projection is always there which leads me to my core belief that am not good enough. Iunderstand social comparison is normal but my case is extreme and affects my self worth. How have others worked on this aspect of their life?",

Definitely didn\u2019t solve the problem but have learned to be kinder to myself. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses and I feel like you just have to believe in yourself(your value as a person) and also accept that your present self is enough. \nOne thing that stuck with me from therapy, is when my therapist told me that I should love myself unconditionally, like a parent would love their child. Accepting their weaknesses as well as strengths. \nIt takes some time to break out of negative thought patterns but I feel like it\u2019s mainly about self love and being kind to yourself.",

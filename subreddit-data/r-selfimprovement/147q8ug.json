    "postText": "(F23 Not sure if this is the right thread to post on but)\nAs I\u2019m going through my healing journey I realized since the pandemic I\u2019ve using unhealthy mechanisms to cope. I would tend to avoid my real problems by Escaping at random times to hook up with someone who wouldn\u2019t even care if I died the next day, hanging out with so called \u201cfriends\u201d who weren\u2019t, and smoking (still do hard to let go). The beginning of the month I knew needed something new. First week of June I felt a mix of hurt, sad, angry, pain and frustration I just wanted be free from the emotion. I grabbed my sharpie and grabbed some dinner plates, on the plate wrote everything I felt. I basically wrote how I felt &amp; a message goodbye to those who I no longer want in my life. Once I was writing done writing on the plate w i just smashed it on the ground. It felt nice to just smash them, felt liberating and stress free feeling to let go. My goal moving forward is to be better at setting boundaries, self improvement &amp; respecting my body. Starting my celibate journey again after breaking it last year (was 2 yrs strong DON\u2019T recommend to break celibacy NOT WORTH IT) And actually enjoying peoples company because due to toxic situations I became toxic and I just want to feel happy and free again!",

    "postText": "So I (20M) recently broke up with my girlfriend before the college year ended, and now its summer and I want to connect myself with more people and perhaps find someone else while I'm still young. What should I do to prepare myself for going out to meet more people to improve my social circle? I'm not the party type of person, but now I'm thinking I should be in order to meet more people at my college next year.",

[physically fit &gt; out of shape] 100% of the time. \n\n- Do stuff/ pursue interests/ get a job: Dont allow yourself to just sit at home and do nothing. Be strict about this. Doing stuff gives you more stuff to talk about and makes you more interesting. It's also how you meet more people. \n\n- Be super open and nice to everyone, you never know who will end up being cool. Take chances on hanging out with new people and doing new things. Start conversations with people.",

BUT the reality of being a human is that being fit is an advantage and will make life more enjoyable. Most people will be nicer to you and are more willing to interact with you if you look good. It's been my experience anyway, and I don't think it means people are bad. I think it's just apart of human nature you have to accept. I believe this affects nearly 100% of humans on earth in some capacity.\n\nPersonally, I think being fit shows that someone has some level of discipline and respect for their bodies, which is a positive trait. It's also good for mood stability and cognitive function. Being fit has undeniable advantages. People shouldn't be 100% judged on fitness, but it's definitely an important part of the equation. \n\nThe least shallow person on earth would want a partner that is physically healthy. \n\nBeing fit will not subtract anything from your life, it will only be positive and add to your life experience. You can still choose to spend time with interesting people and shun shallow douchebags. \n\n(Disclaimer: out of shape people can definitely be awesome and have discipline.)",

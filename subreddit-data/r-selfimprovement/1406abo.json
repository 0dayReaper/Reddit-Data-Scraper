The best years of my life are gone. And before you tell me \"that's not true!!!!\" just admit it that's a cope because you feel the exact same way. There are many once-in-a-lifetime events and opportunities that happen in your teens and early-20's and have missed out on all of them due to being homeschooled, COVID, and then being too much of a pussy to be social in college when I was there.",

You won't know before your death which years were your best. You're very young. You have the possibility to change your life radically and to build something to make you happy. The only thing you seem to be lacking is the will to take matter into your own hands.",

So in my case (closing in on thirty) there are still plenty of things happening, that suck but I am WAY better at dealing with them than I was at 20. Something that would have knocked me out for months in my early twenties now only swings me out of the curve for a day. And with getting better at life it gets easier and more fun.  Even if you feel like you missed out on a lot (and in the end your opinion is the only one that matters, because everyone wants different things) - that can end now. In 10 years no one might notice a difference between you and someone who - by your standards - has not missed out on anything until they were 20.  \nIt's okay and healthy to mourn what you haven't had and would have deserved like everyone else, but try not to let it consume you.",

And trust me, it shows. \nYou don\u2019t have a girlfriend because your miserable negative and insecure outlook on life is primo woman repellent. \n\nI\u2019m going to tell you what you need to do. \n\nUp to you if you choose to do it or not. \n\n1. Stop complaining. Accept that you can\u2019t control anything that happens to you, but you can control your reaction to it. \n\n2. Stop predicting the worst. Yes I know the worst always happens blah fucking blah. Spare us. I don\u2019t want to hear another negative word out of your mouth. Ever. \n\n3. Exercise every single day. Just a walk around the block is fine. Eventually you will want to jog and then you will want to jog further. Start small do it every single day.\n\n4. Get the worst, shittiest, most basic job you can find. Grocery store, McDonalds, toilet cleaner. You will hate it. It doesn\u2019t matter. You won\u2019t be doing it forever. \n\n5. Read books. 1 book a month is fine. Don\u2019t care what book it is. Just read something.\n\n6. College is bullshit. Figure out what you\u2019re interested in and study it on YouTube. If it\u2019s a skill which requires equipment, save up money from your job and invest in the best you can afford. \n\n7. Get on every dating app available to you, match with everyone you can and start talking to people. Doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re unattractive. They don\u2019t want you anyway, trust me. Just make conversation. Challenge yourself to make every conversation with a new person one message longer than the one before. \n\n8. Talk to everyone you come in contact with at work- and when I say \u2018talk\u2019 I mean ask lots and lots of questions and listen really carefully. \n\n9. Be patient, if you do everything above RELIGIOUSLY, then you will see results. Guaranteed. But it will take many months of extremely hard work before you get any payoff. It doesn\u2019t matter. Look how awful your life is right now. What do you have to lose? Keep at it. Trust the process. You\u2019ll be ok. \n\n10. Learn to cook really well. You\u2019ll save money, women love it, and your quality of life will skyrocket.",

If his style of motivation works for you, that's great, but the degree to which he pushes himself past his limits easily falls in the category of self-harm.   \n\n\nWorld-class athletes don't run on torn muscles or broken bones for good reason. They absolutely could, but they acknowledge that it's just causing unnecessary harm to themselves. You don't have to cause yourself bodily harm to prove to those around you that you're \"hard\" or tough.\n\nTo be the best version of yourself you should learn to become highly attuned to exactly where your limits are, so you can get as close as possible to those limits without burning out or causing yourself unnecessary bodily harm.\n\nDavid Goggins markets weakness as a poison and strength as the only path, but in reality we all have seasons of accelerated growth and seasons of restraint and renewal. Learn to \"run\" at your own pace, rather than tearing your muscle tendons to shreds just to prove to yourself the strength of your will and ability to endure pain.",

When you grow up soft and weak (like I did) you feel like complete doormat. I was lucky enough to blame myself for my misery, which gave me a way out. When people blame others, that's when bitterness and hopelessness sets in. \n\nThere is power in \"I'd rather die than lose.\" I'm not saying everyone should be David Goggins. In fact, I think that would be a bad thing, lol. But he's an example of the kind of intensity that's possible. He proves that you can access things inside you that you didn't know where there. \n\nHe says things to himself that I would tell my son to never say. The demonic voice in his head (his father's voice) is utterly vicious. \n\nDiscernment is certainly warranted. But that savage energy, when channeled correctly, can make you mentally unbreakable. \n\nAt least, that's how I take it.",

The real strength in his story is the path to realizing the locus of control lies within you. That you decide. And that your mind will lie to you over and over until you hold it accountable and push beyond what you think you are capable of doing. I\u2019d never recommend someone exercise on injuries or run ultras without training, and frankly I don\u2019t think Goggins really does either. He repeatedly alludes that he did some dumb things and took stuff too far but that\u2019s not the point. The point was, he woke up, started being honest with himself, saw himself clearly and had the courage to say \u201cyou are weak, time to grow strong\u201d, and then took the daily steps to do that. Anyone starting from anywhere can do that. That\u2019s the power of his message. \n\nThere is a mantra (original to Joe Dispenza, I believe) that I hold to daily, and I think it\u2019s worth repeating: \n\nChange your thoughts\u2026To change your emotions\u2026To change your actions\u2026To change who you are\n\nEDIT: Formatting and spelling are hard.",

It wasn't until my fourth therapist that I was able to access the blocked memory of the originating event. I feel like I'm finally coming back to life...\n\n12. Get a neuropsych evaluation. They can be pricey, but well worth it in what you will learn about your brain. It will give your therapist much needed insight into how to help you heal. \n\n13. Get a good psychiatrist. The list above will be much easier to accomplish if you are on the right medications. Depending on what conditions you have, you might be able to wean off of them later.\n\nThere might be some challenges finding the right medication. I have a list of probably a dozen medications that don't work for me.\n\nHang in there. Try to find the things you are grateful for. Try to spend more time focusing on positive things instead of marinating in the negatives. I know this is easier said than done. The more you practice, the easier it gets. \n\nI'm sending lots of love your way. Take a deep breath and see if you can feel it!",

Women don't like to be infantilised. Calling adults \"girls\" or \"boys\" shows how you view them, which is as someone lesser, with unequal position to you. Which is a huge red flag for every adult I know. Another thing is that OP should stop considering relationships and experiences as personal achievements or milestones. It's not a race. Having friends or partner is not something people deserve, but something people create when they stop making everything about themselves. No one wants to be friends with someone who views them as an end goal or something to cross out of their achievement list for life. Relationships should be about making each other's lives better. Otherwise, they are toxic",

My take on OP\u2019s mentality is that he may very well be experiencing depression over his situation and that is a very difficult mindset to pull oneself out of without help and/or situational change. Some people do better than others in functioning during depression, others lose all motivational effort and fall into this pit of despair of that which weighs them down. \n\nOP needs a reason to know he is not alone and not in an irreparable situation. He needs to see a perspective that there are options out there to improve his situation and that maybe everything he is concerned about isn\u2019t all that worrisome afterall. OP may benefit from therapy, if that IS and option for him. Unfortunately, it is not a realistic option for many.",

The biggest problem is he doesn't have his life together at all because of his mental health issues. \n\n&gt;Stop complaining. Accept that you can\u2019t control anything that happens to you, but you can control your reaction to it.\n\nIts not healthy to bottle up your issues and its good to be open up about what is bothering us. \n\n&gt;Stop predicting the worst. Yes I know the worst always happens blah fucking blah. Spare us. I don\u2019t want to hear another negative word out of your mouth. Ever.\n\nThis is toxic positivity. There is a place for negativity because it helps point out things we don't like. He does this because he has poor mental health and negative emotions. So you didn't address the root of the problem. \n\n&gt;Exercise every single day. Just a walk around the block is fine. Eventually you will want to jog and then you will want to jog further. Start small do it every single day.\n\nGood advice but this is very hard to do if you have depression.\n\n&gt;Get the worst, shittiest, most basic job you can find. Grocery store, McDonalds, toilet cleaner. You will hate it. It doesn\u2019t matter. You won\u2019t be doing it forever.\n\nGood advice.\n\n&gt;Read books. 1 book a month is fine. Don\u2019t care what book it is. Just read something.\r  \n\r\n\nActually its better to take action. Reading can be a form of procrastination. For a lot of self-help books you can quickly read a book summary online that gives you 80% of the knowledge in a fraction of the time.\n\n&gt;College is bullshit. Figure out what you\u2019re interested in and study it on YouTube. If it\u2019s a skill which requires equipment, save up money from your job and invest in the best you can afford.\n\nMost high paying careers require a college degree. Horrible advice. Better advice is to figure out what career you want to do and then look into the educational requirements. \n\n&gt;Get on every dating app available to you, match with everyone you can and start talking to people. Doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re unattractive. They don\u2019t want you anyway, trust me. Just make conversation. Challenge yourself to make every conversation with a new person one message longer than the one before.\n\nBad advice again. Dating apps are really tough for men and will likely hurt his self-esteem. He has severe social and mental health challenges so he isn't ready to date yet.\n\n&gt;Talk to everyone you come in contact with at work- and when I say \u2018talk\u2019 I mean ask lots and lots of questions and listen really carefully.\r  \n\r\n\nGood advice but don't get too crazy with the questions or it can seem like an interrogation. He should also talk about himself as well.\n\n&gt;Be patient, if you do everything above RELIGIOUSLY, then you will see results. \n\nGood advice but he also needs evaluate whether its actually working so he isn't trying the same thing over and over again that isn't working. \n\n&gt;Learn to cook really well. You\u2019ll save money, women love it, and your quality of life will skyrocket.\n\nGood advice.",

I understand it can be irresponsible to suggest that all \"depression\" can be solved by pure willpower alone.\n\nBut, you can absolutely \u201cpositive attitude\u201d yourself out of depression. I know because I did it. Not to discount other factors. I was generally in a stable place, I had agency to make changes. But I was in a cycle of negativity that neither drugs or therapy could really fix, having tried both for years. I was stagnant for a while, until one day I just sat in my room for a week, just thinking and doing nothing but self introspection, until I basically decided I should just be happy.\n\nAnd then basically I just told myself to be happy, every single day. It felt fake, but after months and months my brain eventually started to believe it. And now it's not fake anymore. My positive attitude feels like a choice that I make every day. It wasn't easy at first, but now I do it without thinking.\n\nYou can retrain the way your brain works. Its hard, and some people need drugs or help from a therapist. But I didn't. Different things work for different people. But don't discount the benefit of a change of attitude. You can control how you feel. It's harder for some than others, but you can do it.",

Because until you are about 28-30 you still won\u2019t even have a full grasp on things let alone know who you truly are or who you would like to become. That\u2019s facts. I learned this way too late but I will lend a hand in the woman department. You know what women find sexy? Men who get shit done, handle their own, their own way, have self confidence, respectful, genuine, and Stand on their own square. How do you do this ? Stop looking outward. Seriously. That is unattractive to women, when you compare yourself to other dudes. Seriously, get selfish, positive selfish. You will not break going to the gym for nobody . Why? Bc your mind, body and health come before them. Period. You will not be derailed off of studying ? Why? Because it is your brain and you get to build it . Fuck what anybody else\u2019s idea is. Start getting your own. You will gain skills such as, cooking, basic maintenance on your car at least, learn to work with tools, iron your clothes, wash and fold your clothes, clean your fuckin car, mow a lawn, get steady employment , preferably in sales . Get uncomfortable . Sales will teach how money flows . You don\u2019t have to stay in sales but trust me, you will look at money differently after you do . Show that you can be dependable . Show up on time. Be punctual . Be trustworthy . Be someone somebody would call if their shit is hitting the fan. By default , women will want to know where you got your juice and how they can get some . You are respected by others, dependable, self motivated , self maintained, and you have the balls to stand on your own two feet. Don\u2019t listen to this new age BS . Trust me, women will want a taste of that shit. You will also know you are worth it , because you will know what you built . Go on a vacation alone . Yes it\u2019s awkward as fuck. What will happen? You will understand what you like and don\u2019t like better. You will have to navigate yourself and your surroundings . You will make sure you are taken care of. You are stronger than you think . You have never pushed yourself ever . I can tell by your language . You\u2019ve never ran past 2 miles without stopping, you\u2019ve never lifted weights til you couldn\u2019t lift anymore, you\u2019ve never worked a truly taxing job , you\u2019ve never thought of how money flows, you\u2019ve never thought to self reflect and get the honest truth. You stop at poor me I\u2019m a failure. You have two choices in this life . Roll over and take it ? Or get back up and ask for more. I can tell you now , there is no adventure in laying in the dirt waiting for life to kick you again. Get up , move around. You will fail here and there . Good , now you know what NOT to do. Get some more . Go live my friend. Be bold. Have an adventure . You are just getting started . Onwards and upwards.",

            "comment": "What I'm about to say is said with genuine goodwill, but you won't necessarily like it.\n\nYou ask people to give you a reason not to be severely depressed... The truth is, for anyone at any given time, there are reasons to be depressed. I say that because in general, negativity is quite prevalent - especially social media / media, in which more and more of us spend our time mentally engaged. This absolutely does have an effect on the mind and thoughts.\n\nAlso, life itself is ups-and-downs. Sometimes, seasons of each. It is quite easy to sink down into a terrible mindset - but it is SO hard to suffer the consequences of that, convincing ourselves that we can't change anything and not trying.  Alternately, it is quite hard to resist the negative thoughts and destructive habits of a terrible mindset; it is \\*work\\* and we must want it enough to try. In terms of suffering, life can be tough on its own - so we must face the part WE might be playing in our own suffering through habitual negativity.\n\nAnd about that TRY ... there is a phrase relevant here. A master has failed more times than a beginner has ever tried. You're GOING to fail sometimes, dude.... We ALL do.The key is that WHEN you do, don't beat yourself up and go right back down the tubes completely. Instead,  tell yourself it's ok that you missed  ... give yourself time to refocus/ rest ... and then get back UP and go into problem-solving thinking instead of self-bashing.\n\nUltimately, there are a lot of great tools for self-help out there - many of which are free of cost, but the real price is your own effort. You ultimately must help you.\n\nYou may feel depressed about things - it sucks, I know... But you can absolutely try to do even the smallest of things that are good for yourself/ that feed your goals/ growth as a person.That is where your power lies. if you want to overcome, you can.",

I sit and think about my situation and how I want to change it but don\u2019t feel like it. Like I know I should. But I feel like I would rather just give up and die. Only reason I havent killed myself is because im afraid of giving up I guess and hurting my parents. The solution I have come up with is doing what I know I should. Even though my feelings and mind tell me I dont want to. That logical side of my brain knows whats best. If I want to move out then I need to get a job for myself. Even though I know I will hate it. There is always a sacrifice for anything. I want a car, I need money. I want to run, I need anergy and strength. You get my point. So if I want to get better then the sacrifice is doing what I know is best for myself even though I dont FEEL like it. Even though I think about all of the bad possible outcomes. There will only be one guaranteed outcome unless \u201cI\u201d put in the effort and try. It is so easy to give up. Ive gotten so used to failing and then just quitting right after. But I know thats because im weak minded and fallen into the trap of giving up after failure instead of trying again and again. Everyone always asks me when am I gonna get a job or get my license or get a girl and I always brush it off and give them a answer like soon or I dont know so they get off my back about it. One of the biggest things ive noticed is you can\u2019t wait for a motivational moment to get started because I promise you that it will fade and you will return to your \u201cnormal\u201d self. It sucks ngl but I know that I have to just do it anyways. Self discipline is literally everything. Sorry for the Rant/Vent. Just seeing someone else in my situation makes me feel like I should offer my outlook on the situation. Even though Ive yet to heed my own warnings. Maybe it will help you.",

Commenting only because the part about missing opportunities and feeling like a wuss in college resonated. My parents kept me from having a lot of normal childhood experiences (ie driving, extracurriculars, socializing) and when I got to college I struggled with lacking the confidence to do the types of things I wanted to in high school. When I got to my mid twenties, I made a pretty big life change. It was really awkward and uncomfortable for a while, but it gave me so much confidence and really started turning things around for me. When I was 26, I went to South America alone for 3 months. If you had told me when I was 18 or 20 I would do something like that I never would have believed you. \n\nLean into feeling shitty, lean into feeling uncomfortable. That\u2019s the way to change and transformation. If you want it. And you have to decide you want it. You have to choose it , it isn\u2019t going to just happen to you. Look into Ryan Holiday\u2019s books and podcasts. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight. It\u2019s going to feel painful and awkward and you\u2019ll question it the whole way.\n\nI believe things will change for you if you want them to. Like me, sounds like you missed out on some things in that childhood-teenage years. You can keep focusing on that for the rest of your life and feeling like a victim, or you can start making up for it right now. Good luck.",

Went on medication, forced myself to talk to people, forced myself to go outside, forced myself to reconnect with old friends, forced myself to eat healthier, and most importantly I forced the ever living fuck out of myself to actually deal with my problems head on and stop finding excuses for my shitty attitude and mindset and I\u2019m the most confident and content with my life I\u2019ve ever been. You are actively destroying yourself by telling yourself your life is already over. You\u2019re only 20 your life just started. Get your head out of your ass and deal with your shit nobody is going to fix your life but yourself stop the pity party, if you think your life sucks it\u2019s gonna suck if you tell yourself you\u2019ll never find a girlfriend or have friends you never will you are crippling yourself by thinking like that. I know depression sucks trust me I\u2019ve had it since I was a literal child but at some point you have to take accountability and realize you have control over your life if you want to do something then do it no one but yourself is stopping you. Force yourself to talk to people or at least go in public places with people and be open to having conversations be open to receiving human connection, you will find people i promise you you will but you have to have enough confidence in yourself to let people get to know you and eventually love you and not having a license doesn\u2019t mean shit public transportation is better for the environment anyways look into getting a bus or train pass maybe even a bike until the day comes that your comfortable enough to drive you\u2019ll be okay just please try to make your life better for yourself.",

This is not f happening. My suggestion is to continue to waste your life because you are too afraid to socialise, you are to coward to stop playing your dick every single day instead of finding a partner do that. Also, hey why finding a job if you know that you gonna suck at it? I guess that not trying at all is a better options. Life is binary, continue be a loser if that\u2019s what you want. You will look back in 10 years from now and you will be WAY more depressed. Get the f out of Reddit and go meet a new person today just by introducing your pathetic self. They will consider you as a creep, that\u2019s for sure,  but guess what? They don\u2019t give a f as long as you don\u2019t harass them. You can do that a million times until you get better at it. That\u2019s all, probably you won\u2019t do shit, but I completed my good action for the day",

I know all the social media etc makes it seem like somebody has to be insanely social, insanely rich, insanely succesfull at age 18-20. But thats not reality. Sure there are people like that, but not everybody is lucky enough to be born into the perfect conditions. You have at least towards your mid thirties to start your perfect life. Dont give up.\n\nI wont tell you to be happy with what you have etc. I am gonna tell you to choose what you want do with your life and start doing it. Thats all. One thing that you want, one thing. Work for it and earn it. You dont have to have everything.\n\nFor job part, you can start small. Just find basic jobs for now until you land a job that satisfies you. This will also take care of your lack of friend problem.\n\nHit the gym, which you should, this is biggest advice i can give to you, it has so many benefits for your body, mental and sociality. You can find people to hangout with there. If you dont want to, just workout at home. Its good, never harmfull, just do something. It will improve all aspects of your life.\n\nAlso please stop complaining about not kissing or having sex with girls, if you really want just open those shitty dating apps and you will most likely find at least one chick to bang, if thats what you really want. Sex is extremely overrated and totally unnecessary unless you found that special person, trust me you arent missing out anything.\n\nTo solve your porn addiction, you have to just not do it. Thats on you. If you know you are addicted to it, just drop it. Make a limit to yourself, porn isnt evil as long as you limit yourself. If you are extremely horny, you can just follow my advice on dating apps.\n\nDrivers license? This doesnt even need explanation. Just apply my man, literally everyone has it, you can too.\n\nIf you were to make this post when you were 40, i would agree with you, but my man you havent even lived yet. You wont even start the real life until you are 25. You still have time to turn your life around. You got this. For whats its worth I believe in you.",

Your depression sounds circumstantial, not chemical. \n\nYou have all the power in the world to CHOOSE to change your life! Every good thing is possible for you if you move forward and make wise choices. \n\nAre you healthy and able bodied (meaning you're not disabled and burdened with an actual disease or physical limitations)? Do you live in the United States of other first world country? If so, you are already abundantly blessed. \n\nGet off the computer and stop playing video games. Time to grow up. Maybe you can find a mentor, an older man to help guide you. \n\nEveryone wants friends! Get a job, any job, have a good work ethic, be nice and friendly to others, be humble. Go to church. Go on a hike. We ALL have talents and gifts: you ARE good at things. What are they? Do you enjoy putting things together, working with your hands, solving problems, doing puzzles, helping people, helping animals, being outdoors? Do you like working with machines, on cars? Do you like sports and being active? \n\nDude you could go into the military and have an amazing career and opportunities. You could get into a trade school and become a mechanic, an electrician. You do not have to go to college to be successful. \n\nIf you want to do good in the world and you love animals, go volunteer at an animal shelter. Go check out your local cities and see who is hiring. My town is hiring police officers and dispatchers. They get paid VERY well and the city provides all the training you need to succeed. \n\nLife has meaning when you find PURPOSE. A college degree or a girlfriend or sex partners don't give you purpose. You need to find what you are passionate about and enjoy. There are a million things you can do out there. Please don't fall into this trap and lie that it's too late and you should just give up. \n\nMy experience is a woman in her mid 40s who was born with a severe disability. I've had too many surgeries to count and I'm in a ton of pain every day. I grew up pretty poor. I had to decide on my own what direction I took my life. I work hard and have a good attitude. I have a strong faith in God. I got married, had kids, and have a career I absolutely love. It was a lot of hard work. A LOT. But my life is good and I'm happy. YOU CAN DO THIS! \n\nAlso, yes I have struggled with depression too. I think most do at some point or another. You work through it, whether that's getting to see a doctor or talking to a counselor or working to change circumstances that are depressing you. It doesn't need to be a place you live in forever. it doesn't define you. \n\nYou have the power to change your life. Only you.",

Start getting up early and going to bed early too, without a pc or a phone or a tv in the room.

Instead of using these facts to beat yourself up and rationalize giving up, you can set goals around improving them. You need to develop and ruminate on a clear picture of what you want to start seeing the world for its opportunities, without that you\u2019ll default to only seeing it\u2019s threats.\n\nYour mood is regulated by the perception of moving on a positive trajectory between where you are and where you want to be, NOT just having everything you think you want. So being in a place you don\u2019t want to be is as good a starting point as any if you\u2019re willing to try to improve it. On the other hand if you acknowledge these suboptimal circumstances and allow yourself to believe you\u2019re not capable of changing them then things are just going to get worse.\n\nGood news is you have plenty of time; set some basic goals, give an honest effort, and don\u2019t beat yourself up over not attaining them immediately. It\u2019s a learning curve not line so it\u2019ll take a little while, but you\u2019ll benefit from positive momentum in the short term regardless.\n\nLife is difficult but if it wasn\u2019t it wouldn\u2019t have the potential to be meaningfully rewarding. Have you ever seen a good movie where the protagonist had a perfect life from start to finish? \n\nLastly, you\u2019re actions and beliefs are inextricable. If you act in a way congruent with the belief your life doesn\u2019t matter/can\u2019t be improved, how do you expect to feel differently? I believe this is why exercise has such positive mental health benefits. It\u2019s hard to put yourself through that physical discomfort while maintaining the belief you don\u2019t care about yourself/your future.\n\nJust about everybody has felt the way you\u2019ve felt at some point - we are in this together.

You are an adult now so you need to take accountability for yourself.   Stop FFS feeling sorry for yourself.  Stop the negative attitude.   Take accountability for yourself and make goals for yourself. Start small, very small with your goals. Celebrate each victory- no matter what it is.  Don\u2019t determine your worth by others.  Make a list of things you can control , and things you can\u2019t control.   Looks like there is a lot you can.  I\u2019m not so great at the friendship/dating sphere but the factors that I can control I work my hardest , and take accountability for my mistakes.

When you evaluate your life this way and hit this rock bottom-ish anger, one will sound as you do. That\u2019s fine for the start of this conversation.\n\nWhen I was 19 and 20 I had comparable feelings and a comparable life evaluation. That\u2019s why I\u2019m on this sub, I subscribed to it many years ago. \n\nI\u2019m 23 now and let me tell you, life is amazing now, and I worked towards that. It\u2019s all I cared about and the grand majority of seconds I spend contribute it to one way or another. \n\nI think the whole \u201c16-20\u201d is your prime years! Is some sort of hollywood bullshit. I feel just as good, healthy, and energetic as I did those years, actually I feel even better. Cause the handful of adult experience and growth I have now gives me more confidence and skill to have a better day-to-day life.\n\nIt also gives me the optimism I\u2019ll be like this through my 20s and even 30s, for which I can create a good or maybe even better life for myself.\n\nI live a life I could have never imagined then. Have a well-paying job that also has work life balance and I enjoy. Had success with woman, then got into a great committed relationship with someone beautiful whom I share chemistry. Made great friends. Live by myself in a great 1 bedroom apartment. Have spare money to do things I want, comfortably go to bars, etc.\n\nJust follow the advice, quit porn, and work for it. Do career research and strategizing. Go make friends. I would justify losing some study time for unique social opportunities and would constantly put myself outside of my comfort zone, take risk, and face rejection.\n\nYou have lots of time. Go build the life you want. It\u2019s the beginning of adulthood, it\u2019s time to start building. Yes, some people were instantly spoonfed the life they want, but that is a minority. Yes you may be starting from complete scratch but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t build a better life than the average one if you work extremely hard for it and are dedicated.\n\nGet building!",

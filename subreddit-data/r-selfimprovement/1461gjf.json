    "postText": "Me and my gf got together around September (both 22f) as we were going into our 4th year at university. She is at a different university and she stays at mine a lot. Everyone loves her and it's wonderful and exactly what she deserves. When we first started going to parties together everyone loved her and I'd find her talking to people I had never really talked to. It was wonderful. But recently I've noticed that although many people love her, they are still not talking to me. People who are acting like her besties won't even say hi to me in the corridor. I didn't really mind this all that much until it started happening with my close friends and housemates. People gush about her all the time, asking when she's coming back, asking me to tell her things. It's got to the point where I struggle to have a conversation with anyone without them bringing her up. My housemates have started messaging her plans instead of me and she's starting hanging out with my best friend alone because they are from the same town (which is completely fine, but added with everything else it's just chipping away at me).\n\nThis is really damaging my self worth. You could replace me at university with my gf and no one would notice - they'd probably even like it better. This also comes a week after I found out some of my home friends are still friends with my ex who they know didn't treat me well and is quite a traumatic point of my life. I just feel like a second choice. \n\nI have no personal self doubt in my own personality. It's been something I've been working hard on since my year abroad where I had an amazing group of friends that were so supportive. During this time I realised how wonderful things can be with the right people. I've been working on myself a lot, but this is knocking me down a lot. I'm not really all that bothered because I already know I'm not really clicking with people at uni - I've been working on myself to understand that they're just not for me, but it's so hard seeing my gf fit in so easily. It's almost like I don't even belong there anymore. It's like I'm visiting her at uni and it's not my own home. It's making me feel very worthless and just a second choice. I feel like all my self confidence that I've been working on over the years is just being torn down.\n\nI'm moving to a new city soon so I will get a fresh start like my year abroad and I can start building it back up, but I'm really struggling at the moment. I just wish someone, just one person, could pick me over her for once. I'm just getting very fed up with it.\n\n(This is no hate to my gf, she is wonderful and deserves all the love she gets)",

            "comment": "My wife and I\u2019ve been married over 14 years.  I am the lovable, outgoing charismatic one.   My wife has extreme social anxiety, the differences are probably more pronounced than with the two of you because she is they type to not go out and it\u2019s been very hard to live a life with someone when we are at such opposite ends of the spectrum.\n\nHere is my advice:  sit her down and have a talk about how you are feeling.  I had no idea, I am like a golden retriever, happy, fun, everyone is happy to see me and I\u2019m happiest in a crowd of people who are happy to see me and I was unaware that she was terrified in the corner.  I couldn\u2019t fathom that, I just thought everyone like being around people.  I was young and selfish and clueless. \n\nI\u2019m much older, mid 40\u2019s, and hopefully wiser and I know better but now when I meet her work friends I dial it down.  I don\u2019t talk as much and I am a 2 instead of a 8 or 9.  I let her have her friends without taking over and monopolizing the room.  Most of her friends are from work because that is where the interactions she has can happen in a way that she can tolerate and I actively try to stay away from interactions with her work stuff so she can have her place in the world without me being the focus.  She deserves friends and people who think she\u2019s great because she is, I don\u2019t want to step in that.\n\nIt\u2019s funny because she talks me up to her coworkers and they want to meet me, so I have but I\u2019m careful not to be my extra self.\n\nI have all my own work stuff to be extra and my own social group to bounce off the walls with.   She never joins me with those, she can\u2019t handle that sort of stimulation, it\u2019s too much.  \n\nI hope this helps.  Good luck to you both.  Let me know if you have any further questions.\n\nEdit: We are both women also and both the same age like you two.  I thought adding that little tidbit bit add some context.",

I have spoken to her about it a couple of times, but a few days ago I properly told her how much it upset me and she said she was aware of it (she also finds the situation a little strange) but wasn't aware of how bad it was and how much it was affecting me. I think now she's more aware of it, things will get better. For me right now, the priority is her and I've realised I just need to get through the end of this year and next year I can focus on finding some people that I click with more, but maybe I could suggest to her some of the things you've said to her. Thank you !",

IDK.\n\nSee??... you are much more than what you think you are!\nYou are confident and bubbly also! That's obviously a part of yourself too.\nI used to drink alcohol and smoke pot to lower the social anxiety and let the other part of my self appear. once in a While... so that it didn't become addictive. \nAnd yeah! Ofc That's a dangerous path! \n\nI felt normal and at ease when I was under the influence of alcohol or pot.\nSo... my therapist explained that although feeling more confident is normal, feeling \"normal\" ment that I had a lot of anxiety. And that I just couldn't be myself bc of the anxiety. \n(The cause of this was traumatic events on my past)\n\n\nI needed to heal my heart and my wounds. It wasn't easy... but I'm a better version of myself now. I'm me 2.0.\nI think you need to heal too and work on yourself.  Little by little your \"other self\" will start to shine! \n=)\n\n\nStart a journal of your thoughts and emotions.  And where you think you are in life. I know it sound like a little girl thing.  But it's really useful to clarify your thoughts and emotions.  Hide it well! \nAnd you could also use reddit to share your process. \n\n\nPs.A little bit of alcohol on social situations is ok. Don't abuse. (And obviously when you are not a driving).\n\nTake care kiddo!",

I can tell my partner at times has had jealousy over this and issues with this and has even acted immature because of it. My partner has social problems and used to take that insecurity about it out on me. It has almost ruined us at times in our 11 years together. But we\u2019ve gotten past it. All I can say is communicate maturely immediately how you feel and or what you\u2019ve noticed. Communication is key. But I\u2019ve also noticed there will always be a dominate / charismatic person in the relationship in every aspect. That\u2019s okay. But I will admit the fact your friends and roommates suddenly don\u2019t speak to you and instead her as well as the plans part is some weird shit. I honestly wouldn\u2019t know what advice to give ya on that other than once again communicate this and see their response. It will speak volumes.",

If you broke up today everyone would still like your gf more then you, but I doubt it's even true. People are more affectionate to women than men and it sucks, but remember. Quality over quantity. A lot of your gf's \"friends\" either talk about her behind her back or wanna get in her pants. Form a good bond with one or two people and continue to bond with your girlfriend. Good luck dude.\n\nEdit: I read the whole thing. Your best friend shouldn't be hanging with your girl. Your giving her to much leeway to go have fun without you. Remind her that your her boyfriend. If she's not willing to parade you around like you were the son of God she ain't for you.",

    "postText": "(19M) Picked up a weed habit a couple months ago and became a chronic user as of late. I don\u2019t feel like myself when I\u2019m off it so I\u2019d often consume during my work breaks to make it easier to talk to customers and ease my social anxiety.\n\nI decided enough is enough. This is my third day sober and the withdrawals are hitting hard. Irregular sleep patterns, irritability, depression, low energy. I know I need to push through the pain but I\u2019m worried it\u2019s only going to get worse from here.\n\nCurrently I\u2019m working out regularly (3 days weightlifting and 2 days hiking per week) and have a clean diet for the most part. Drinking only coffee, tea, and lots of water. My sleep schedule is all over the place but I attribute that to my inconsistent work schedule. \n\nWondering if anyone knows any other coping strategies or had similar experiences.",

            "comment": "First off, you\u2019ve made a great decision, and an especially hard one for someone so young at that.  There is a lot of really good news here and I will tell you why!\n\n1. You are on day 3! Day 3-5 is when the physical withdrawal symptoms peak, depending on the individual.  It\u2019s truly the first big hurdle when stopping chronic marijuana use.  \n\n2.  You are working out regularly even with the pain you are you feeling! This one is key to promoting your brain function to become regular again.  It\u2019s going to boost the re-stabilisation of your endo-cannabinoid system a lot faster, and you are going to become physically more fit because of it.\n\n3. You diet is clean and you drink mainly water!  I\u2019m assuming this means you aren\u2019t eating processed sugars, and that you getting a lot of nutrients from fruits and vegetables.  Again, all things that you need to for your body to re-calibrate.\n\n4.  You\u2019ve been using for a couple a months. It might seem long, but considering people successfully get through weed withdrawal after decades of chronic use, a couple months in perspective isn\u2019t that long.  This ain\u2019t going to make the short term withdrawal that you are feeling much easier, but it\u2019s going make the long term process a lot shorter.  \n\nA bit of what to expect moving forward.  Like I said 3-5 days is when the physical symptoms of marijuana withdrawal peak.  If you can push and make it to the end of week one, it\u2019ll feel night and day from where you are now.  After 3-5 days you are going to have some residual effect that can linger for some time, but this is to be expected.  \n\nYour body has what is called the endo-cannabinoid system.  It runs through out your entire body and it regulates everything from digestion, sleep cycles, body temperature, organ function etc.  Marijuana binds directly to this system and with enough use it can really destabilize your natural functions.  What you will experience once the physical symptoms wear off is a sign that you body and brain is going through the healing process.  It\u2019s not exactly fun, and you need to be patient and compassionate with yourself while this is happening.  Depending on your duration of use, quantity of use, and other individual factors, this timeline will vary.  But considering you said a couple months I don\u2019t imagine it will take more than a few weeks to a few months.  \n\nYou need to keep up your routine and the healthy habits during this whole process.  It will speed up the healing of your endo-cannabinoid system and generally lower the time it takes for you to feel better.\n\nI promise it will get easier.  Do not get discouraged with the length of time it takes for your body to heal.  Have compassion for yourself and understand that these feeling are not permanent.  Your body and brain need to heal, and they I will, I promise.\n\nStay strong through this and try not to cope with any unhealthy methods. I know the insomnia is rough but try not to run for over the counter solutions.  Your body will sleep when it needs too and the insomnia will eventually pass.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this my friend! \ud83d\udcaa",

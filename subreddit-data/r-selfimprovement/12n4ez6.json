    "postText": "Hey r/selfimprovement,\n\nI wanted to address an issue on this subreddit that seems to be affecting a lot of young people out there - attaching one's self-worth to whether or not you have a girlfriend/boyfriend/etc or have had sex.\n\nSociety often puts an immense amount of pressure on people to achieve these milestones as a measure of their worth, but it's essential to understand that your self-worth is about so much more than your relationship status or sexual history.\n\n1. **You are a complete person on your own:** It's essential to remember that you are a whole, unique, and valuable individual, regardless of whether you have a partner or not. Your worth is not determined by someone else's presence in your life. Embrace your individuality and work on building a strong, independent identity.\n2. **Focus on personal growth:** Instead of focusing on finding a partner or engaging in sexual activities, shift your focus to personal growth. Invest time in your education, career, hobbies, and personal interests. Work on becoming the best version of yourself, and you'll naturally attract people who appreciate you for who you are.\n3. **Develop healthy relationships:** Building and maintaining strong friendships is crucial for a fulfilling life. Establish meaningful connections with people who share your values and support your growth. Genuine friendships can provide emotional support and bring happiness to your life, regardless of your relationship status.\n4. **Mental and emotional well-being:** Attaching your self-worth to relationships and sex can lead to anxiety, stress, and low self-esteem. It's essential to recognize that your mental and emotional well-being is a priority. Practice self-care, engage in activities that bring you joy, and don't hesitate to seek professional help if needed.\n5. **Understand that relationships are not a solution:** It's a common misconception that having a girlfriend/boyfriend/etc or engaging in sexual activities will solve your problems or make you happy. However, relationships come with their own challenges, and it's crucial to recognize that happiness comes from within.\n6. **Patience and timing:** It's important to understand that everyone's journey is different. You may find a partner or engage in sexual activities at a different time than your peers, and that's okay. Life isn't a race, and you should focus on building a life you're proud of, rather than comparing yourself to others.\n7. **Embrace vulnerability and emotional intelligence:** One of the most attractive qualities a person can possess is emotional intelligence. Learn to express your emotions, be empathetic, and communicate effectively. Being vulnerable and emotionally intelligent will lead to deeper, more meaningful connections with others.\n\nIn conclusion, remember that your self-worth is about so much more than your relationship status or sexual history. Focus on personal growth, establish healthy relationships, and prioritize your mental and emotional well-being. By doing so, you'll create a fulfilling life and attract the right people into it.",

I have better guidance now on where I need to go to find the kind of people I want to be around. The thing is ever since I was a kid I have always had trauma surrounding my gender identity and I have always known I was this way, but I let the trauma of bullying from rural southern hell traumatize me into being something I am not and in return I couldn't even express myself. I'm still figuring it out. I will probably be getting therapy. But even then, I have never had someone be truly accepting of who I am, and it's still hard to find support groups in my area even though it has grown a lot since I was a kid. But I refuse to go back to conforming to what society views me as because that isn't how I want or ever have wanted to express myself. That's literally all I want. For most people, that isn't a lot to ask. I've been outcasted my whole life and then by trying to conform to fit in. I outcasted and got outcasted by the very people I should have held close this whole time. I can't blame myself too much, homophobia was rampant back then, and gender identity wasn't even a known concept in my area. Even now, I get dirty looks for wearing pink clothes.\n\nI ended up in a limbo of trying to fit in but never wanting the people I put my act on for, then scaring away the kind of people I did want to be around because of my act. I'm past that, but it's still haunting to be stuck like that for so long. I gave up at one point even, tried to take 'the easy way out'. But fuck that shit.\n\nI'm 28 btw not some child in case someone decides they want to throw that at me.",

We dated for two years. We also had sex. Yeah, sex is great\u2026at first. Eventually, it and other things drove us apart. I spent a miserable year after our break up which was my senior year in college.  \n\nA year later, I met the woman I would eventually marry. We dated for 5 years before we got married. We waited to have sex until we got married. Now, I regret having sex with my first girlfriend. My wife and I have been together for 20 years and while we have had ups and downs, it has been good. \n\nIt is hard in the process and it is hard to see that \u201cthis too shall pass,\u201d but it does.

Often times you have to experience a relationship to realize **it is hard**.  IMO the growth mindset comes from trying, failing, and persevering despite that. It's hard for someone who hasn't experienced a full relationship to feel like they can take this kind of advice to heart (we see the same responses and posts despite the sameness). Sometimes people come here for comfort on top of the advice and that's okay. While it's nice to see the advice compiled I think people will still continue posting because it's nice to hear you're doing okay and you'll get there one day.",

I never cared about relationships until people made comments; rude, sarcastic, hateful comments which made me feel worthless. Comments like your a loser, you have no game, you must be gay bro, you cant pull any girls, you cant keep any girl interested, you cant even be friends with a girl, or have you noticed how no girls come and talk to you at all etc ... Just some of the comments Ive had. \n\nI have never asked a girl out in my 27 years and you know what I dont think I ever will. \n\nIm actually ok with that. I dont care anymore, at the end of the day when people make their comments I will ignore them, carry on smiling and being myself. I have to shift the focus from others onto myself. And sure there will be people who laugh at you or you might crave a relationship or a girlfriend, but those feelings pass like all other feelings. \n\nFor those misogynists who blame women you can go to hell, because women owe you nothing, I will always treat women with respect because THEY OWE YOU NOTHING.  \n\nContinue improving yourself for yourself and no one else. Be kind respectful and courteous always.",

I killed my desire for a relationship and it flipped a switch in me. Of course it falters sometimes and I do think about what I could miss out but I feel massively changed because if I survived all these years, why cant I survive forever like this right? \n\nI actually love talking to people and smiling and being happy has changed things. I learnt to listen to people rather than talk and this has changed things a lot.\n\nI hope others can accept things as they are but in doing so not blame others for their life.

Self improvement is a means to make oneself more attractive as a partner, it just feels better for us to mask the real reason behind it. Like how we say that looks aren't that important, but all of our behaviour reflect how enormously important it really is.\nNot being desired by other people in various ways, specifically the sex of interest will lead to depression for most of us. \n\nI disagree with the post, I think it is human nature.",

Maybe you determine you\u2019d be fine without a partner, that doesn\u2019t change your desires. Some ppl desire a cake, but there\u2019s an objective way to get a cake, make one yourself or purchase one. The difference is ppl aren\u2019t cakes. There\u2019s no objective way to receive another person desire, love and affection. While I agree all those thing mentioned by op helps, even acknowledging those things, doesn\u2019t change what an individual may desire.",

This is due to my core value of compassion.  \n\n\nFunnily enough, family does not appear anywhere in my top 10 core values, however, friendship does.

Dating, relationship, and having sex is much more important when you're younger than when you're older.\n\nWhen you hit your 30s, not only does your sex drive become lower so you have less need for sex but you'll also probably find out that there are other aspects in life that are much more important and which in fact make you happier than any relationship could ever give you.\n\nLike pursuing your purpose and fulfilling your life task. I've been with plenty of women throughout my life, have had lots of sex with beautiful women, and although that has been all good and fun, I've never been more happy than when I self-actualized and was all by myself.\n\nBeing all by myself, saves all my energy and gives me both clarity and peace of mind which is undoubtably priceless in these times.\n\nThis is also why I don't want kids unless I'm 100% financially secured in life because I've seen people screw themselves one too many times to the point where they lose all their freedom and dignity to do what they want.\n\nAt 38 years old, I am glad I still have managed to doge that bullet, especially the horrible past years that has been taken place, where I actually have mainained my peace of mind and balance, and have made good investment decisions prior which has sustained me beautifully.\n\nSo again, I agree 100% with all of these points in terms of living a peaceful and happy life. Taking care of yourself, mentally, physically, and financially should ALWAYS be your number 1 priority, and you should never ever feel guilty or shameful about it.",

From my own experience, being told some of these things did not help, regardless of how true they were. My suffering could be rationalized away. It was only after I took concrete steps and became empowered to fulfill my needs that I started experiencing greater peace and inner well-being. It was from that point that the wisdom emerged naturally, for example, \"I am complete on my own\". I think some of the wisdom you shared is a side effect of being a fulfilled person who knows how to meet all their needs. I don't think that learning those things on an intellectual level does much to help. At least it didn't for me. So if someone here is like I was, feeling desolate and thinking \"I've found some widsom here, why am I not feeling better?\" Know that you're not crazy, you're not a failure. Yes, it's hard and it takes time. Others can, at best, help you as best they can, but you have to be the one to save yourself and care for yourself.\n\nThat said, I'd like to share two bits of wisdom on the subject. Sex can fulfill multiple different needs: warmth, connection, play, tension release. All those needs can be fulfilled through strategies other than sex. Don't confuse the strategies for the needs. That's something I learned from Nonviolent Communication. Also, our need is not so much for sexual activity as it is for sexual expression. I won't go into more detail about this one now except that I learned this from Betty Martin's Wheel of Consent. My greater point is, sex and romantic relationships can be good ways of fulfilling some essential needs, but let's not be too dogmatic with the ways to meet those needs, and let's aknowledge that those needs are indeed very important to us. I hope we can all learn to meet our needs in ways that suit us and our particular situations.",

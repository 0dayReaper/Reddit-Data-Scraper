    "postText": "I recently concluded that I am, in fact, a narcissist, and it has been killing me and the people around me. I want to change, and I think one of the biggest steps I can take is redirecting my most prominent character flaws into more positive attributes.\n\n these character flaws include;\n-wanting everyone to like me\n-wanting everything to be perfect\n-taking things too personally\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking long and hard about this, but I can\u2019t figure out what to turn these negative flaws into.\n\nAlso, I'm reading Laws of human nature great book\n\nTLDR; I am a narcissist struggling to convert my character flaws into strengths. Any advice would be very helpful.\n\nUpdate: my apologies for misusing the term narcissist I was in the heat of the moment writing this and it looks like I have low self-esteem.",

It sounds like you just have low self-esteem and perhaps you compensate for it in ways that make you feel like a bad person. Are there any other things you feel point towards you having a narcissistic personality?",

(This is coming from someone with the same tendencies, so don\u2019t take it as an insult lol) But the fact that you\u2019re self aware enough to consider you might be one, coupled with the fact you seem willing to make a change, tells me you aren\u2019t narcissistic.\n\nA narcissist can\u2019t see anything past themselves and how great they are in their own mind. They aren\u2019t willing to consider what another person\u2019s opinion of them might be, unless it benefits them in some way. They assume everyone automatically loves them because they love themselves so much. \n\nI think you could work on these negative character traits by realizing that no matter how hard you try to be likeable, someone out there will find a reason to be negative towards you just for the sake of it. Whether it stems from their own insecurity, or you have different interests, or maybe they just felt like being a dick; understand it\u2019s not your fault. Just like you don\u2019t like every single person you meet, not every single person you meet is going to like you. Life is imperfect, and it always will be. All we can do is try to be a better person than we were yesterday.",

I have a lot of narc traits, as do my parents.\n\nThe fact you want to change means that you are probably not a full blown narc.\n\nAside from low self esteem (I don\u2019t love that term, btw) it\u2019s possible you have some form of RSD. I have it pretty bad. It\u2019s an adhd trait, explore that and see if anything fits.",

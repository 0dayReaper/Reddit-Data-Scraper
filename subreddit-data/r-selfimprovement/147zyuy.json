What about a small step that you can repeat to lock it in to your life.\n\nTry r/self_sabotage soon they\u2019ll start posting some new material",

In the evening toward the end of the day, write down 1 or 2 or 3 of these situations - what happened, how you responded, what the circumstances were, why you responded the way you did, etc.  Then think about how you could respond differently next time, in a way that's better and not self-sabotaging.\n\nDo this exercise every day or every other day for a while, you're building up your ability to recognize these situations, and you're working through how to respond to them in a way that works for you.  You start off doing it after-the-fact, but then as you get more experience you will start to be able to recognize it and respond more appropriately in real time, as it happens.\n\nBe patient - it's a process.  But be persistent - it's important and you deserve a good life without all that self-defeating stuff.",

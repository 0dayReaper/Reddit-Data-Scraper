If you encounter any obstacles, instead of getting frustrated and giving up, try to look at the situation objectively and look for a way to deal with it. If you can get used to doing that, then you can achieve pretty much anything you want in life.\n\nThe most important thing though for achieving anything in life is to take control over your mind. If you don't you will always be swayed by it, doubting yourself and making yourself miserable, always looking for excuses, etc. So learn to recognize when you should listen to any thoughts that come up and when it's best to ignore them. And for the latter, the easiest way to ignore any useless thoughts is by focusing on something else.\n\nI also highly recommend learning about how our brain works. It will help you greatly with taking control over your mind and your life. And for that I recommend reading some good self development books, which should already provide you with all the knowledge you need, the stuff that is actually useful. The stuff they teach at universities is mostly just so you can talk about it rather than implementing it in your own life. And written in a very dry manner, like most study material in our education system. While self development books are about providing valuable information in an easy to understand manner, with plenty of examples of how to apply the things you've learned.",

Find your own purpose in life. Find something you find meaning in that validates your existence. Dont listen to what everybody else says or does. Dont be pressure by others.\n\nFor me, my mindset is taking life one day at a time and protecting my mental health as I struggle with ADHD depression and anxiety. Im actually good it just sucks sometimes.",

If you ask me, everyone is traumatized from living under capitalism, from living in a pandemic, &amp; as a woman you've been traumatized from living under patriarchy. Obviously if you're a WOC, you're traumatized from living under white supremacy. \n\nEstablish good habits-- eating healthy (focus on GBOMBS-- greens berries onions mushrooms beans and seeds), getting good rest, &amp; exercise (cardio, strength training, &amp; stretching to keep your mobility-- I like yoga cos it's strength training and stretching, at once, plus mindfulness!), meditation or at least mindfulness. \n\nGoogle how to do the values exercise, with a list of values. This is an underrated activity to help you guide your life! Relatedly, read Man's Search for Meaning &amp; ponder your own life's meaning &amp; purpose!\n\nCultivate community. Even though you're young &amp; your community might change many times over your life, it's a good practice to develop. Right now you probably rely on your parents for a lot, but as you get older you'll need your own network of people. The time to create community is not when you have a broken leg &amp; need help! You have to do it ahead of time. \n\nDefinitely don't prioritize dating! It's ok to get a babefriend, but don't be so serious about it all. You're young &amp; you're going to change a lot over the next decade, decade &amp; a half. Oh &amp; please don't date anyone much older than you!!! \n\nSource: I'm 44 lol",

I have always not felt ok but I have reached a NEW point where I felt dangerously not ok, like I was about to have a stroke or a seizure or something. I thought my body was going to stop working. The thing is that every day I would wake up and feel like shit, with no motivation to \u201cstart\u201d the journey. I would also wake up already comparing myself to others and thinking about what they were doing more than myself so I wasn\u2019t even thinking of myself!\n\nFor the past two weeks I have stopped drinking coffee, and I also got out of a very triggering and unhealthy environment that promoted comparison, and I feel so much better, I feel like I\u2019m ready to start this journey.\n\nMy sleep schedule is terrible\nAll I eat is sugar, carbs, or junk food\nI never exercise, not even going on walks\nI never spend time outside \nAll I do is lie in bed all day on my phone\nI never meditate or do anything of the sort\nI stopped showering, brushing my teeth, shaving, taking care of my skin, etc.\n\nNo wonder I feel like shit",

You don't need to make yourself miserable by stopping every single habit you've taken years to develop.  Just start adding new good things in and eventually there won't be enough room for all those old bad things.\n\nDo good and stay strong!",

Break down bigger tasks into smaller, more manageable steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\r Consider using the Forfeit app as a tool to keep yourself accountable. It's an app where you commit to completing tasks and provide evidence, or you lose some money. It can be a fun way to motivate yourself and stay on top of your goals.\r  \n\r  \nFind activities that you genuinely enjoy and that bring you happiness. Whether it's going for a walk, reading a book, or trying out a new hobby, doing things that you love can help improve your overall well-being.\r Remember to be kind to yourself and practice self-care. Take time to relax, engage in activities that help you unwind, and prioritize your mental and physical health.\r Surround yourself with supportive and positive people who uplift you and encourage your growth. Sharing your journey with others can provide a sense of community and make the process more enjoyable.",

It's amazing how much better you can feel in a week.\n\nDon't try to do everything all at once, you'll end up punishing yourself when you fail. Even if you start doing just one of those things above, you're doing better than you are currently.",

I know it's for the better, overall, but you could cut right from that line to the last, and it would describe my struggles if I took the same path.\n\nGlad to hear you're fighting the good fight.  The struggle to right that ship and get ahead.\n\nIt's good that you've taken a few essential preliminary steps.  But non-preliminary, ACTUAL steps that will help you full speed ahead will be going to that third paragraph, and making changes for the things you say after, \"All I eat,\" and, \"all I do.\"",

The days where I was held hostage by my own negative thoughts, locked in a cycle of self-destructive behaviors. \n\nJust as you have identified, the root of many of these problems was not caring enough about myself. It's hard to break free, but you're already on the path by recognizing your current situation. \n\nProgress isn't linear and it's okay to take small steps. Maybe today, it's just getting out of bed. Tomorrow, it might be a short walk outside. \n\nYou don't have to become someone else overnight, and comparing yourself to others is only a recipe for pain. \n\nYour journey is yours alone, and there's strength in the vulnerability of self-improvement. Good luck on this path - remember, you're not alone in this struggle.",

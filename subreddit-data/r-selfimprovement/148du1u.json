I don't mean to minimize what some of you might be going through but the amount of times I see this on this subreddit is baffling to me. \n\nI hate the \"I wish I was as young as you\" phrase from older folks just as much as the next guy but it's not completely wrong either lol. You can radically turn your life around in a year or two, you guys got so much time to learn and fail.",

Like a lot of kids I felt forced to decide \"what I want to do the rest of my life\" by the time I was eighteen. I gave up that at idea and at thirty I went back to school for something 18 year old me would never have imagined and got a high paying job a couple years later.\n\nSimilar story work my wife except she figured it out way earlier. We were working at a grocery store and she just decided to lean into it and climb the ranks. Work all those skills she eventually landed at a startup and is now a COO. It didn't matter where she was so much as that she kept moving and fighting.\n\nIt's really all about just going out and doing it, whatever it is.\n\nI really hate the quote \"do what got love and never work a day in your life.\" It's actually \"love what you do.\" Whatever you're doing, being your whole self to it. Be present and conscious and effective and you'll have a lot more fun, even if the job sucks.",

Video games were basically my drugs and I was hopelessly addicted.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was 26 and realized I needed to make a change or I was probably going to end up killing myself. \n\nWent back to school, learned how to socialize better, graduated, got a decent job, started dressing better, moved out, signed up for online dating, started going on dates, learned how to talk to women, got laid a few times, ended up getting a girlfriend (ex now), moved to another city where I got a way better paying job, now dating an awesome lady, and looking to buy my own place soon. \n\nAbove might sound like bragging, but it\u2019s really more just to show that if someone like me who felt like I was at the lowest of low can actually dig himself out, then anyone can. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it was a really fucking tough journey. I\u2019m definitely still a work in progress and I still have those really rough days, but it\u2019s way better than it was 10 years ago.",

For us 19-20 year olds who possess this sentiment of \u201cfeeling behind\u201d, it is also often associated with the thought that we are wasting our youth away.

Having kids also seemed like a nice idea at the time.\n\nThe past few years have really hammered in the truth for me \u2014 I won\u2019t be able to afford a house by the time I\u2019m 30, I probably won\u2019t be able to afford to have kids until that window has passed, and I generally feel like I\u2019m being handed a shit sandwich with how expensive food/cars/houses/everything has gotten relative to wage growth. I feel behind now, but only because I\u2019ve learned how the world really is.\n\nI\u2019m happy I got to spend my childhood in ignorance, but now I see things for how (I believe) they are, and it\u2019s a grim future for 95% of my generation.",

There is so much you don't see though that is beyobd only that one pic or a 30-second reel/tiktok. I call it the Instagram effect. It's the small snippet of a good thing that could have literally been surrounded by shit. \n\nThat's why I rarely post things anymore cause it's a highlight reel in most places except for Twitter, where I treat it like old school Facebook that I share random thoughts in a short character limit. \n\nI actually use a photo/video app that I snap random photos of the good days or the memorable moments I want to relive to see how far I have come. Some years I share it and others I may not. I started it when I was going through one of the hardest few years of my life so far. \n\nSometimes, I would be balling my eyes out in bed, unable to get up, and then I would see rainbow colors through the window on my wall. It would remind me that I am still breathing and able to witness something beautiful even in a place of dark brokeness. \n\nNow it's my own personal highlight reel to savor the little moments that make every day worth getting up for. One of the biggest and last things my grandmother said to me is that she was grateful to live in a time where we get to document things about life. Before she passed, she said she loved to always rewatch out home movies because it was her favorite show to see. It allowed her to relive some of the very small things and big things again. She said it was important to enjoy more of the little things because that's the stuff that sticks with you the most when you start losing your memory as move into your 80s and 90s. \n\nI have always loved home movies, and nowadays, that is all I have left of some of my family that I loved so dearly. I love putting myself in my grandpas or uncles perspective, knowing that was the person behind the camera. So, I translate all of this to my life today with the photo app. I have every year saved on a jump drive. One day, that's all somebody else may have left of me, but they also get to see how I lived life from my POV.",

Facebook will drown you in bad news while people only post the best parts of theirs lives giving the false impression of perfection. Snap chat has driven people into delusion with the invention of facial filters to where they view their natural complexion as ugly. And tik tok is where intelligence goes to die and has probably contributed more to stunting mental growth then watching tv ever has.

Then we graduate high school and go into college with 0 concept of what we want to do, get into crippling debt or even if parents paid have a huge feeling of guilt over it and are convinced we are just lazy, meanwhile the world is collapsing and the economy fucked to the point of seemingly having no hope. All this while life is changing so fast we cannot stop to take a breath and if or when you do you may realize it all amounted to nothing. Your degree means nothing and you are at square 0. Did I mention no one wants to hire people with experience of less than 5 years in any career field.\n\nAnything you could be interested in is taken or paid poverty wages, and any career worth anything is so time consuming and difficult to start that you either give up trying or resolve yourself to see It through no matter how much you despise it and yourself. Did I mention we have all been depressed since we were 10.\n\nI had resolved myself to suicide when I turned 18 due to a shit family life and a sense of utter worthlessness for the entirety of my existence.\n\nPart of the terror of going into the real world is the fact that school and parents teach you that failure isn't an option. So it's really easy for you all to say we have so much time left but we need money, freedom, and joy in our lives, none of which we have currently, hence the rush and feeling left behind.

I\u2019m in the top 90th percentile in terms of income for the age group and I have a good job, a masters degree in a good field, professional certification, solid career prospects, I\u2019m working on starting my own businesses, have good friends/family, and I can put a roof over my head and not worry about groceries or utilities. It is hard to ask for much more, but I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve \u201cmade it\u201d since social media has ruined our generation.\n\nYes, my life is fine. In fact it\u2019s great and I should be more grateful, but\u2026I have friends who make more than I do, work fewer hours, do more incredible things, travel more incredible and exotic places, have more incredible experiences, etc. Yes, yes, yes we should be grateful for what we have, but have you ever been around a rich person at 2:34pm on a Tuesday afternoon who says \u201clet\u2019s go wake surfing on my boat for a few hours because I\u2019m bored then jump on a plane to Puerto Rico for the rest of the week?\u201d all the while they made more money saying that sentence than I\u2019d make in a week with my good job. The level of comparison is insane. When you know that what people on social media show is a possibility for life, everything else feels shallow and meaningless. \n\nYou might say, \u201cyeah but social media isn\u2019t real.\u201d It still feels real and there\u2019s a modicum of truth to it while you sit there and think, \u201cwow I have a pretty nice 9-5, but why am I sitting in an office wasting away my life here when other people younger than me are making more money and doing whatever the hell they want?\u201d \u201cWhy date that person, there\u2019s people out there that are more attractive, wealthy, better personality, etc.\u201d \u201cthe next best thing is always around the corner.\u201d\n\nPandora\u2019s box can never be closed.

Right place, right time. But we are seeing the effects of this in young individuals' confidence. We're seeing the detriment in online dating/hookup culture and people having crazy expectations and standards, usually based off of social media, TV/film, and podcasts.\n\nAlso I think a big shift is how wide the gap is of someone in high school to \"adulthood\". With prices so high (housing, food, activities, college education) trying to start adulthood can be rough. I as a man approaching 30 do not envy them. They're trying to grow and date and live but the gap of what you need to make even to live bare minimum is getting really hard to do at entry level jobs. So it gives a feeling of \"why is this not working? What am i doing wrong?\" That coupled with constantly looking at people relatively your age living more luxurious styles can be very tough.",

I think a lot of it comes down to a few things: the uncertainty of a changing world, the cultural attitudes we have about ourselves and relations to others, and loneliness. We have perhaps never had more individualistic attitudes of ourselves than at any point in history. Even the idea of a nuclear family, one of the biggest cultural pillars of our parents generation, is considered optional. There are many upsides to this, but as there are no alternative social arrangements being focused on, this leaves many with nothing other than living for themselves. We are told that a career in and of itself is the highest ideal to aspire to, that someone is most valuable when they are able to put themselves into a role of complete self sufficiency. In other words, it says that we should exist entirely for ourselves. These attitudes on one hand alienate ourselves from others, and on the other hand, prone us to feeling inadequate based on comparisons to others. This works in tandem with the strong cultural idea in the west that says everyone is born roughly equal in all aspects of life, and that any deviation from the increasingly restrictive expectations of young people MUST be due to some kind of personal inadequacies, rather than due to external factures, such as socioeconomic factors, upbringing, genetics, etc. We leave very little ideological room for accepting any deviations from the idea of idealized version of a high status person. If you fail an exam, struggle making friends, don't have a lot of money, etc, not only is it your fault, but you should feel ashamed for it happening to you. It's almost taken my whole life to not think about myself in this way and accept myself for everything I am, good and bad. To recognize what I can change about myself, what I can't, and what changes are actually valuable to me. \n\nI think the biggest thing I could say to younger people is,  foster the good relationships to other people you have in your life, or work towards making new ones. For me, the biggest thing that has kept me out of the slump of negative thinking I described above is all the people in my life who have supported me. The people who were able to reassure me when I have given up, remind me that I have worth and am loved.",

That was my best decade, mentally, spiritually, and physically. \n\n\nThe envy that old people have for young people is often many different things. You can see it in the very different sayings that they use.\n\n\n\"The follies which a man regrets the most in his life are those which he didn't commit when he had the opportunity. Helen Rowland.\"\n\n\n\"I'd like to buy you for what you think you're worth and sell you for what you're really worth.\" -- Lewis Bostwick in his 70s\n\n\nRegret is often behind the envy the old have for the young. Take a lesson from that. I was lucky.\n\n\nI went to visit a high school buddy one afternoon. His mom opened the door, invited me in, then told me he wasn't there. She talked a bit, not really making a lot of sense. Mostly small talk, like 'how's school'. \n\n\nThen she started to cry. She wrapped me in a hug that felt defeated. \n\n\nWhen she settled down, she backed up and caught my eyes with hers, and said, \"Don't put off your dreams. If you put off your dreams for too long, the just won't mean the same if you finally do them.\"\n\n\nI never found out what her dreams were that she lost. But she inspired me. I went to a music master class in Italy as a raw beginner. Talked my way in with a lot of help from my music teacher. I traveled coast to coast in the US. I fished for crabs in the Bering Sea. I lived a winter in a cabin in the woods in Alaska. I moved to Idaho, then Tucson, AZ. Finished my time with music and refocused on martial arts for five years. Met some healers, which turned on a big light in my head. I followed that thread for five years. \n\n\nAnd then I got a career in IT during the Dot Com boom. I've been rejoicing in that career for 27 years, still working full time with no reason to quit work.\n\n\n19 year old me was a lost soul. I 'knew' there was some grand purpose for me being here, and that actually kept me frozen. My friend's mom broke that ice for me. Instead of seeking the right thing to do, I followed my gut and passion and just dove in. It turns out, it's not that disappointing when you quit some endeavor that you've fully invested yourself in for five years.\n\n\nIf this resonates with you, especially the bit about having more than one interest in life, please pick up a wonderful little book by Barbara Sher called, \"I could do anything if I just knew what it was!\" and her second book, \"Refuse to choose!\"\n\n\nThe first book is all about *how* to find what's next for you. It's so easy, it's embarrassing once you try it for real. It works wonderfully and the surprises are delightful. \n\n\nThe second book is about project management for those of us that have more than a single purpose this lifetime. It helped me anchor and manage my IT career so that it compliments everything else I want to try.\n\n\nCheers!",

Part of it is social media, but I think another major part is how difficult it can be to set realistic goals with such little life experience. The quality of life people used to earn by 20 we now earn at 30. And in those extra ten years life can be absolutely brutal and devastating. People who ran in to some bad luck in their 20s 30 years ago by losing a job, or divorce, or medical issues probably had a little money stored away. Now if anything bad happens before you\u2019re able to be self sufficient you\u2019re either in debt, homeless, living in group housing, or with parents. Any setback is amplified more than anytime before. \n\nMy issue is that we have mechanisms in public policy to help fix these issues, but can\u2019t make progress while the generation before pulls the ladder up behind them, and our society values image over prosperity. It\u2019s better to look successful than to actually be successful.",

I would compare myself to my coworkers who were all older and more established, and did so until I was the oldest person in the room. It was only after that I had the \u201coh shit! moment\u201d and realized that you\u2019re as young as you feel, and comparing your circumstance to anyone, irl or online, is the trap that makes you feel old. I\u2019m turning 31 in 2 weeks and I\u2019m almost 3 years in recovery, I met the love of my life, I beat one illness and am in good treatment of my alphabet of mental problems. I have a healthy, happy little pet at home and a decent job that gets most of the bills paid on time. Some of this stuff I thought may never happen, let alone happen \u201con schedule\u201d. Life is short but life is also long as hell. Do things in your own time and it\u2019ll be hard to feel old because you\u2019ll be busy living instead.\n\nI guess this started as an answer to your question of why, and turned into a little inspirational speech. Hopefully that\u2019s alright. \n\nAnyways, I think it is comparatives of any kind, not limited to social media. Even comparing yourself to your siblings can feel like too much. And recreational depressants like alcohol don\u2019t help either! Take this advice from someone deep in recovery: unless you are the top % of master mixologists in the world or the president of Budweiser, booze is NOT going to get you closer to your goals. And it\u2019ll make you feel like every step in the right direction is a drag. \n\nGood luck 20 somethings! There is a lot more time left, you\u2019re only in the first or second quarter of life and that first quarter of childhood is mostly supposed to be learning how the world *is*, not even how it *works*. You\u2019re all doing well no matter what stage, it\u2019s all going to be fine and if it\u2019s not we\u2019re all going to be dust soon anyways! Embrace it!",

I have friends who are 20 or 22 who are owners of houses or companies. Their path in life is definitely different but as a viewer it's difficult, especially if it's something coming from a middle class fam. I suffer from this so much everyday there's this moment where I feel like it's over and even after understanding the facts about my time shall be right and things will get better all of it, it's still so freaking difficult, can't help but feel like a lowlife at least once a day and worse I want to change it and I can't",

For me (for reference, I'm 27, and I struggle with this a but less now, but it was a big issue from like 18 to 23), it was seeing dozens of people that I knew, posting themselves at huge parties, or with groups of friends at fun events, basically like every day. I was never popular, and I spent a lot of my time alone, so I felt like absolute shit a lot of the time, knowing that most people around me were doing all these amazing things with their time, pretty much because of who they were friends with, and how popular they were.",

I don\u2019t compare myself to Mr Beats because he\u2019s different than me, different country even.

It leads to burnout and depression. We have a very sick society.\n\nOh by the way social media reminds them that they are not as beautiful and not as successful as other people every day. And they can\u2019t afford health insurance to actually deal with the depression. It\u2019s a bullshit system.",

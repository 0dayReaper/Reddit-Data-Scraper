    "postText": "A lot of people are constantly angry because of stuff they see or read on the internet.\n\nIt's important to remember that almost none of the stuff you get angry about on the internet affects you in real life.\n\nPeople are constantly outraged about all of these controversial figures like Elon Musk, Logan Paul, Andrew Tate, JK Rowling, Ben Shapiro, Alex Jones, Kanye West, or Jordan Peterson, but why?\n\nIn the case of JK Rowling, \"middle aged British lady who you will never meet in real life says controversial thing on Twitter\". Is that what you want to worry about? Are you going to spend your time on that?\n\n\"YouTuber scams audience with NFTs\" okay? Who cares. I don't do crypto stuff, so I couldn't care less about what's happening in that space.\n\nThere is a whole subreddit dedicated to hating Elon Musk with over 100K subscribers, where 100K people get together and get angry because some African guy said a stupid thing on Twitter. One of the most upvoted posts there this month is literally Musk talking about how he doesn't like Chess and prefers more complex games. In what way is that something to be angry about?\n\nWhen you're caught up in all these online spaces it seems really important but when you stop viewing that type of content you very quickly realise it actually doesn't matter.\n\nYou only have so many hours in your life, why spend them getting angry at some guy who said stupid things? On your deathbed you're not going to be like \"I wish I spend more time watching liberals getting owned by Ben Shapiro compilations\", you're never going to regret not wasting time.",

I used to stir up shit in comment sections constantly and all it did was made me obsess over \u201cthose idiots\u201d and getting myself angry. \n\nIt would put me in a bad mood and I would often be short tempered and get in stupid arguments with my wife. \n\nThat\u2019s still a problem I\u2019m working on (anger) but there\u2019s a huge difference now that I steer clear of that stuff. \n\nI was into it so badly that I would eventually specifically seek this stuff out. It has been a hard habit to break. I still slip sometimes but now when I see someone tweet about something stupid that irritates me I usually block or mute and move on.\n\nThe worst thing that came of this behavior is I pushed away people that I was friends with, sometimes for years, by jumping into their comments section and being smug and combative. \n\nNow I really don\u2019t have anyone I can consider a close friend. Not completely because of that behavior but it certainly was a major factor. \n\nBurned many bridges instead of just rolling my eyes at a post I thought was dumb and moving on, now I feel very lonely in life. One of my greatest regrets.",

In the 1990s, evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar published a study claiming that humans can cognitively handle up to 150 meaningful social relationships (which includes family and friends) at any point, colloquially known as Dunbar\u2019s Number.\n\nOnce you exceed the Dunbar number, all of your relationships tend to suffer.\n\nOr another way to look at it is the quality vs quantity challenge.\n\nI can care about one or two issues passionately and have an impact on those one or two issues, or I can care about 500 issues and have no impact on any of them.",

If looking at the news about some issue is triggering intense despair, you need to re-evaluate how to best engage with the issue. People know they can get away with bad behavior by encouraging apathy, but they can also get away with bad behavior by wearing other people down or getting them to care so much that they feel despair (which, itself, is a form of apathy, since you're giving up).\n\nFor me, I try to cultivate a sense of \"rational insanity\" and \"rolling with it.\" I let myself go a little \"insane\" in the sense of \"Nobody knows how bad it could get, so you might as well hang on.\" That helps me \"crowd out\" extremely negative emotions.",

                    "comment": "As an addendum to your comment, I see a lot of these thread headlines that aren't very helpful in their wording in this sub and other closely related self help subs. \"Stop consuming\" is a pretty controlling phrase. Something closer to \"You may want to try to consume less aggravating content, if you value your sanity\" would be healthier. And then go into the body of your assertion and explain why one may want to and leave it up to the reader. You can explain how strongly you feel about it being beneficial, but you can't command other people to do what you think is right, even if you are spot on.\n\nIn CBT there are several cognitive distortions that are outlined. One of them is \"should statements\". It's unhealthy to tell yourself I \"should\" do this. Often times these should statements can be hidden behind other wordage. Basically, you're your own boss, if you don't like wasting your time and getting angry, you probably would like to change your habits to doing it less or not at all. When you fail on something that you \"should\" have done (which is inevitable, lets be honest), you'll likely feel bad, tell yourself you're a failure, and cause yourself to get stuck in a loop. Especially around self help and therapeutic avenues, these kinds of thinking are really not helpful. If you want to do something, you'll do it, but it won't be very motivating because someone else told you you have to do it or you should do it. When you'll do it you'll do it because you decided to, not because someone else decided for you. Ideally with a good dose of optimism and understanding. Any good therapy works the same way.",

For sure, it doesn't do any good to consume a lot of content that you know will make you angry or depressed at the state of humanity.\nIt's important to think about why that kind of content makes us that mad to begin with. We are responsible of letting it trigger our hate and emotional response.\nThose are only opinions that we can decide to research on, dismiss or laugh at. \nI also think it's important to really understand opposite worldviews, even far-fetched ones, to build our own arguments and not demonize someone without solid reasons.\n\nI'd say the most dangerous thing is to over-watch empty content, the one that doesn't make you think and destroys your critical thinking abilities.",

Not trying to start a war on this thread, but you can't really argue with his \"personal responsibility\" message such as cleaning your room and getting your life in order.   \n\n\nThe people who are spending way too much time trying to debunk these individuals are meanwhile wasting valuable time in their lives that they can be using to reach their full potential. I get psychologically why people do this though.

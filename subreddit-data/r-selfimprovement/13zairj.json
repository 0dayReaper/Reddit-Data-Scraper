    "postText": "So I have this thing that went on since I'm 13 years old. I have my mantras which I say literally every second in my mind. The best way to explain it is by saying it's like a refresh rate that, for example a monitor has. I'm saying to myself every second \"stop overthinking, don't be shy, be confident\" for example, to refresh myself to the person I want to be. And for maybe one week these mantras function well but after that they stop functioning and I need to change them up. Is it because it's too exhausting for the brain to say the same things over and over again because I literally say them every second? Or is it because I try to be a person I'm not for too long? I mean it really sounds absurd when you speak it out. Literally I'm trying to base off my whole personality and life around these 3 sayings: \"stop overthinking, stop being shy, be confident\" If these mantras wouldn't wear of after like a week, I would still use them in 50 years. What I'm trying to achieve by using these mantras is consistency. For that week, before it wears off, they function really well and I'm really the person who I want to be, at that time. And I'm consistent in that one week. And after that week they start to wear off and I'm getting really sad because my mantras don't have the same effect anymore and I'm staying in my bed browsing for the next new perfect mantras I can use.\n\nI know this sounds really weird and nobody else probably does it like that but can someone relate? Is this a problem with perfectionism?\nShould I just drop the whole mantra thing and let my thoughts free?",

            "comment": "What is your mind like when you're not rehearsing mantras? Are there common fears, pains, regrets, anxieties? Are there root causes of that negativity which you could address somehow? Have you tried meditation and journaling?\n\nI don't think there's anything inherently wrong with mantras, and you seem to be using them for good reasons, but it is dangerous to sweep painful mental patterns under the rug for too long. Try to spend more time being present with your mind and see what thoughts bubble up. You can come back to the mantras, but even the mantras will work better if you first address the root cause of the feelings you're trying to bury. Wishing you all the best!",

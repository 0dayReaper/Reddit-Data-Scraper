I've never heard of that for nicotine use.\n\nOtherwise, you're correct. u/D0vacs, nicotine rewires the brain (extremely quickly, I might add). It's amazing the things your brain will tell you to convince you to get more nicotine. You've literally got to ignore it. You need to be able to remind yourself of why you're trying to quit, and you need to be able to outwit yourself, so that no matter what your brain is telling you when the craving hits, no matter how you *feel*, you recognize that it's the addiction talking and you ignore it.\n\nDo not wait to come up with a plan for what you're going to do when the craving strikes. Figure that out when you're in a sane state of mind, and then just execute on it when you get a craving. Again... No matter how bad that plan sounds when you get a craving. No matter how much easier it seems like it would be to just get one more refill.\n\nUnlike with alcohol, you will not die. You will be just fine. But you will suffer. Wanting to quit nicotine means wanting to suffer for two weeks for the sake of MUCH LESS ACTUAL SUFFERING in the long term. The feeling of being healthy for years makes the short stint of discomfort feel like a scraped knee long since forgotten\n\nHell, that could be a good mantra. When you get a craving, tell yourself that you scraped your knee. It sucks, but the only thing you can do to fix it is to wait for time to heal the wound.  \n\nIf I find another minute hear I'll dig up an old comment of mine from when I quit smoking cigarettes",

I don\u2019t think feeling guilty about vaping really helps my issues, if anything I just end up vaping more or doing something more harmful when I overthink it. I will stop when I want to stop, which will be whenever I have more negative than positive effects from it, or when it just isn\u2019t necessary anymore.\n\nI think people need to remember that sometimes stress is more harmful than a specific substance. Being determined to discontinue a coping behaviour rather abruptly, will result in you having to do something else to manage the consequence of that. If you do want to quit, you have a higher likelihood of success if you do it gradually. It is very similar to how you would wane off psych meds. \n\nJust a tip, do take note about whether you\u2019re addicted to the action or the actual nicotine content more when you consider how you\u2019re gonna quit.\n\nEdit: I guess my answer would be that we\u2019re kinda aware that we\u2019re doing it for a reason and it just doesn\u2019t seem necessary to put ourselves through the stressful process. Unless it\u2019s really messing us up, why stop? Idk if everyone thinks about that consciously, but I think they subconsciously know from experience.",

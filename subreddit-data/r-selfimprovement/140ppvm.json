    "postText": "I've come a long way with my self care journey and I can happily say that I do like the way I am and the way I look. While I still struggle with body dysmorphia, I'm able to look at myself in the mirror and like what I see.\n\nLately though, I feel like \"self-love\" can only go so far without validation from others. Not getting compliments or looks or matches triggers my anxiety and makes me feel like I'm being delusional about my appearance. Like I'm the only person that sees me this way and that I shouldn't be happy with my body and that I've fooled myself into loving myself.\n\nSo my question is, how do you learn to completely disregard others' opinions of you and just love yourself? How do I stop feeling like I need to be validated by everyone else?",

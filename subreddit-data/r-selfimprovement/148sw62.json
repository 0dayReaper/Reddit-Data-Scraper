    "postText": "I (29M) in Illinois have been depressed for years and a woman who I caught feelings for never saw me in a romantic way. For a while I have been self misguided and been in bed for years while broke and broken hearted with no promising future. I lamented that I couldn\u2019t leave town for my lack of pay, I saw myself as a nobody, I wasn\u2019t going to have anybody, and did some mental damage that took me a while to fix.\n\nI then came across Cyrano de Bergerac (1990) French version. Cyrano is a renowned poet, swordsman, witty, intelligent, a writer, and many more interests that commanded attention and respect in every room he walks in. What spoke to me about his character was his insecurity for his long nose, while I felt about my height (5\u20193\u201d) \n\nHis ability to find his strong elements and wield by command inspired me to change my narrative. I put down the social media for 2 whole years and disappeared from the public. I quit my old gym and switched to a kickboxing gym, I returned to college to get my minor degrees in music, and culinary. Took salsa dancing lessons, I am also taking French and Italian lessons. I subscribed to Audible and listened to a lot history and science books while driving to work or working out in a bag. I learned calligraphy and improved my writing with a quill. \nThen something clicked in my head. Exercising the brain, the body, and the heart made me more whole and gave me the affirmation I never knew I needed. I felt so happy with myself after being in the state of flow. I once thought having a girlfriend, getting married with a kid with a house would make me happy, but I was wrong. I needed to learn to have elements of grace while doing things and give grace to resolve my insecurities.\n\nSince I returned to my social media for a year now and posted new things that is worth sharing and reconnected with my family from other countries because I will be traveling soon, the lady I caught feelings for started initiating conversation and asks for a meet up after she was seeing my profiles in social medias. All of a sudden I am getting likes and comments from her, but I feel so disenchanted by her when she started reached out. She dated other men while I was working on myself for 2 years holding on to never feeling on being enough for people and I know I wasn\u2019t on top of her list at first. (It\u2019s not her fault for she knew I liked her when we first met and she can\u2019t read my mind how I will feel about her now) getting the girl shouldn\u2019t have been my goal, I am happy to know it was learning and growth that will give me grace to my troubles. I will find someone one day, but I am going to take the longer way and keep going to college then take courses about money that will help me get way off the poverty line. \n\nFinally I am giving it my best and I am happily surprised at the new rewards it brings, it feels amazing. It all started with learning different hobbies and interests that took up my interests and spoke to me.\n\nThe brain: The brain is where the logic takes place from mathematics, science, philosophy, languages, and history.\n\nThe body: take care of your body for you only have one so make home with it and understand some cards your are depth with, but improve what you can. Please get regular checks ups with doctors for insights to your health. Workout or take an MMA gym to keep in shape (stay away from fighting), learn to dance to make the body move, and always learn to eat healthy by taking proper cooking lessons.\n\nThe heart: Music, art, poetry, language arts, and writing is home to the heart.\n\nExercise those three you might say you\u2019re living life to your fullest potential and truly awaken your individuality. The mountains that couldn\u2019t be moved before will start to finally yield. Here\u2019s to becoming happy and ode to life. I hope you guys find your own remedies. We don\u2019t get things right the first time when we try, all you can do is your best, you got this \ud83e\udd18",

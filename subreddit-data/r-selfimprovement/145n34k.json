Trying to improve your mind, body, and bank account all at the same time is a lot to balance and will burn you out. \n\nContinue to focus on the gym and meditation until you\u2019ve developed a solid habit, then look into ways to increase your income. It\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. \n\nPlus, you\u2019re in school. Staying in school is the best way to increase your income in the long run, so you are already on the right path!",

    "postText": " I play a lot of video games. Not the kind that are extremely common, like GTA, Call of Duty, or any game basically involving a gun. I play a lot of games made by Nintendo, but I realize I get bored extremely fast. I\u2019m having a hard time finding something I\u2019m generally good at, although I\u2019ve tried many genre of games. The games that I actually like playing and are fun to me, I seem to lose a whole lot. For example, when I play Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, I play with a few friends but not very often. I try to play online but I lose almost every match. I can\u2019t enjoy it fully if it isn\u2019t a fair type of game. Pok\u00e9mon. I play Pok\u00e9mon a whole lot too. I want to be good at pvp, but I don\u2019t feel like putting in the effort is worth it, and I usually finish the games within two days. I\u2019ve tried playing Showdown but I just lose a lot. I think I\u2019m just dumb, but a lot of people tell me otherwise, as my iq is a little above average. I don\u2019t play shooting type games because I\u2019m not good at them whatsoever, except maybe the Splatoon series, but i have a hard time making it into A rank or even S like I want to. Sports games, I have never won a single match and I don\u2019t feel inclined to want to get better at it. I\u2019ve tried searching all over for games I\u2019m good at, even Roblox.  My problem is either I get bored easily, or I\u2019ve generally got no skill. I try playing strategy games as i\u2019m very good at math, but I have a hard time with those too. I\u2019ve asked people to teach me how to get better, and nothing has ever worked. I\u2019ve trained for hours on fighting games and I still aren\u2019t good at them, even though that\u2019s the genre I really want to play. I tried getting a different hobby. Art, I have very shaky hands and cannot draw very well. Writing, I have a hard time getting ideas flowing through my head. Card games, my luck is usually terrible and I can\u2019t think after four moves. I would very much like some advice but I\u2019ve tried Google searches, I even brought it up with some of my friends. I don\u2019t see how a therapist would help, as they are just payed a ton to lie to you. I have a brother with ADHD and no therapist has been able to help him with his behavior. I guess the problem is that I think about everything as I act, but if I don\u2019t think, i\u2019ll never be able to see what I am doing, and if I don\u2019t act, I can\u2019t get anything done. Please, I would like some advice if possible. Thanks!",

Instead of putting pressure on yourself to be an instant pro, focus on having fun and enjoying the journey.\r  \n\r  \nWhen it comes to gaming, try exploring different genres and don't be afraid to lose a few matches along the way. It's all part of the learning process. Maybe team up with friends for some cooperative gaming sessions or try out strategy games that can tap into your math skills.\r As for hobbies outside of gaming, keep experimenting! Shaky hands for art? Embrace it and create unique pieces. Writing block? Start with short bursts of writing and let the ideas flow naturally. And hey, luck in card games might not be on your side, but keep playing and honing your strategy.\r  \n\r  \nWhile therapists might not be everyone's cup of tea, they can offer valuable support and guidance in various aspects of life, including finding direction and building confidence. But remember, therapy is a personal choice, and if you feel it's not for you, that's totally okay too.\r And here's a cool idea: you can try using the Forfeit app as a fun way to challenge yourself and stay motivated. It adds a little extra incentive by making you complete tasks or lose a bit of money. It might give you that extra push to keep exploring new hobbies and games.",

Art, I have a very hard time drawing really anything because I can\u2019t really imagine things. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t have an imagination. This is the same problem with writing.",

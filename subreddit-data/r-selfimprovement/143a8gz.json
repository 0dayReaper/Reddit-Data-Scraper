There are things I want to take up and learn but I have no motivation to put much of an effort whatsoever. Days hardly differ from one another, it's all the same. Just another bleak day in which I have accomplished nothing. Apathy has fully engulfed me. How do I regain back my energy?",

            "comment": "First, start small. Pick one activity or interest that you used to enjoy or that you've been wanting to try, and commit to doing it for just a few minutes each day. It could be something as simple as going for a walk, trying out a new recipe, or reading a few pages of a book. The key is to build momentum gradually. Additionally, consider finding an accountability buddy or using a habit-tracking app like Forfeit to keep you motivated and make the process more engaging. Forfeit is an app where you commit to completing tasks and provide evidence; otherwise, you lose some money. \n\n Finally, take care of yourself physically and mentally. Prioritize self-care activities like getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and practicing mindfulness or meditation. Sometimes, simply focusing on your well-being can lead to a natural increase in energy and motivation. Remember, it's okay to have off days or moments of low energy, but with patience and persistence, you can regain your zest for life.",

Just relax and join these daysdays, try to aware of your bodily sensations, kind of make self-talk. Focus on the current moment of your life \ud83d\ude09\nPicking one of activities you used to enjoy was suggested to be the good option and I almost agree. But it would be a way off better, I think, to have a go at something completely new, something you've never tried before. Such activities are thought to increase your mood and give some energy.",

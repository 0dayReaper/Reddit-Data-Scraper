    "postText": "Hello. I posted on here a while ago for a similar predicament. \n\nI tend to shoot myself in the foot a lot. What I mean by that is any time I am given the opportunity to succeed, I mess up. \n\nI work in a field where great opportunities are few and far between where I live. Time and time again I screw up with emails, such as typos or putting the wrong name when addressing someone. Keep in mind, I try to triple check emails/projects for this. Also, someone tells me one thing when that isn\u2019t the truth, then I\u2019m the one who suffers and costs myself time and money because of these errors, leaving a person, or sometimes multiple people, upset with me. Grant it, I am new to this field but many of my peers strive with little to no instruction. I am someone who needs specifics, especially with direction, in order to strive.\n\nThis affects my social life, making me less confident in relationships, whether romantic or platonic, and makes people think I don\u2019t like them because I am too shut in. It is at the point where I can\u2019t be with people who are my friends and family for more than an hour because I get annoyed/bored. This is something that I recognize is my fault, but I am too busy worrying about what is going on with my job. Keep in mind, this is a job I am actually interested in and not a job I have to keep me in the wage cage.\n\nI also tend to word things weirdly, whether it be when I talk or in writing. This may also affect the way people see me. I think people believe I am dumber than I actually am. At the very least, people know I am inexperienced but aren\u2019t willing to train or be specific about what I need to do, which I understand why they feel that way because, once again, costing time and money. \n\nIn other cases, I think people think I don\u2019t care enough. I tend to not respond to text or emails the second I get them, but usually get back within 5 minutes to an hour max. This, in turn, makes me look like I don\u2019t care to people who do respond the second they get them. \n\nAs I kind of hinted at before, people will suggest ideas I know are dumb, but because I don\u2019t have confidence in myself, I think that I what you are supposed to do. In turn, I get punished for it. This also leads to burned bridges. People talk in my field, which leads to less recommendations.\n\nI don\u2019t like upsetting people and I am not confrontational. What can I do better to succeed? How can I be healthier in social settings due to this? My job does require I am timely, but how timely is too timely, and vice versa?",

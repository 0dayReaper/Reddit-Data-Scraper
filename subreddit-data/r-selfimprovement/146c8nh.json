I am going through a hard time and every time they say something I feel like it\u2019s attacking me like sneak dissing .. idk if I am being to sensitive or if it\u2019s them .. I recently lost my job and got into a car accident so I\u2019ve been a little depressed I try to remain positive but with no car or income it\u2019s hard .. idk what to think , feel or say \u2026",

    "postText": "At the age of 18, I was self admitted into a hospital. I believed at the time that my thoughts were being monitored and it drove me crazy. I got in trouble legally and suffered a brain injury before this.At the same time I thought was in love with a girl. And was overly persistent, out of character. This has lead to me not pursuing a relationship. I believe this incident was the beginning of schizophrenia developing. Now(7 years later). Have been to probably a half a dozen psychiatrists but none of them are able to have much of an impact as they just go by the book and I think somewhat abstractly. I live at home. Have some savings. Haven\u2019t worked in about 2 years due to stress and anxiety/paranoia, am on disability, don\u2019t have really any friends, just some online and a few family members I talk to. Some bad habits, gambling, drinking, vaping, too much video games\u2026. Was once into powerlifting but have faced injuries. Too anxious to go back to the gym. Never been in a real relationship\u2026feel stuck. I am intelligent, but have a very hard time finding motivation to pursue my ideas. I understand nutrition and exercise are important, understand finance well, but gambling has slightly hindered mine(not terribly) and the world well. But can\u2019t relay my thoughts into actions due to the severe anxiety and paranoia I have..Any advice would be appreciated!",

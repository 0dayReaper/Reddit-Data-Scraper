Okay, have you deleted it? Yes? Good. Your life has now improved by 2X. Now when you wake up, will you be scrolling endlessly knowing full well you\u2019re wasting hours of your life staring at a brick? No of course not, the apps are gone. Congrats! you have now got more time to focus on making sure you are the best version of yourself. \n\nNow what if you get social media cravings? Put your phone away.. Ask someone to hide your phone and don\u2019t get it back until that craving is gone. Do anything to ensure you don\u2019t reinstall and rejoin the endless cycle of staring at a screen and slowly rotting your life away. :)",

We tend to think of people as having long lifespans, and that\u2019s not a representation at all to the outlying events that can and do happen, that happened to your dad.\n\nMay I suggest, taking good care of your physical and mental through a good diet, sleep, setting time aside to relax, and time to relax further and further than current ideas of relaxing. Journaling, joining a support group, talking with a friend, and getting professional help. \n\nAll as a part of a strategy to take care of yourself.",

And either will keep you from living in the moment and that will make you miserable.\n\nYou can spend years on psycho therapy and not getting anywhere. Or you can learn to be present in this moment right now. And that will solve all your problems. Not for good. As soon as you go back into unconsciousness they will all come back to light again. So you need to work on being more conscious or self aware at all times. That is the only way. Otherwise your mind will take you over and will keep creating all kinds of thoughts, more and more of which might be harmful as things progress. They are usually useless, so why bother analysing them? See the for what they are, then if they seem harmful or like a waste of time, simply choose to focus on something else.",

You can spend years understanding the causes and all the intricacies of the problem. And talking about it with strangers online. But will that fix your problem?\n\nThe solution is usually very simple. But if you feel that you need to understand every nuance first, then you will need to spend a lot more time on that. Until you maybe one day come to the same realization: That none of that ultimately matters and that if you want to fix a problem, you need to deal with it directly.\n\nDon't confuse endlessly dwelling on things, maybe specifically so that you don't have to take action to do something about them, with rational thinking. Which means: Looking at a situation, figuring out what the problem is and what causes it and how to fix it. Then taking action on it. If you ignore that last step all you're gonna do is waste your time, and likely will make this problem a defining part of your life. Part of your identity. When the solution was probably always there. You just weren't willing to see it.",

(See how this stuff is fluid, not linear?)\n\nAnyway, to actually replace the fuel pump then is not impossible but requires X tools and Y steps. \n\nSo I think that \u201cjust fixing the problem\u201d is a little bit of an oversimplification but I think you are highlighting a distinction rather than saying there\u2019s not any X tools or Y steps. So I think we\u2019re fine there.\n\nI think overall, you\u2019re saying you have a method that works better than what I\u2019m saying, \n\nbut I think judging from your post history about your method 7 years ago about stopping your addictions that haven\u2019t fed to complete and total success in your own life,\n\nyou are also here to hone whatever methods you\u2019re experimenting with using discussion.",

Observe them and see them for what they are. And when you recognize that a thought doesn't serve you, actively choose to ignore them simply by focusing on something else.\n\nYour mind is the one that is creating those thoughts and that it keeps creating more and more negative, harmful ones shows that you are losing control. If you want to stop this then you need to take control back. This you can only do by bringing some awareness into your life. Try paying more attention to your thoughts and whatever's going through your mind. Then consciously decide which ones deserve your attention and which don't. Also seek out activities that require your full attention. They help get you out of your head and in that way should reduce your mind's tendency for overthinking as well. But taking control back is the key and it's something you can only do consciously.",

I'm not depressed I am very happy but I just want more excitement in life and I don't know what to do? \n\nI've done most travelling, gone to most exclusive parties, bought everything I always wanted, always with friends/bestfriends, work as a scientist etc.\n\nThe only thing is I've never fallen in love and patiently waiting for it to happen. In the meantime what else can I do to entertain myself?",

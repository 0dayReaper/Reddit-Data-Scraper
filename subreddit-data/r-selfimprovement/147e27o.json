    "postText": "Hello everybody. I stopped by because I am having a hard time staying productive when it comes to my writing hobby. What got me into writing is when I read tons of scripts and novels. I watch a lot of movies, indie short films, and shows. I love to write screenplays and novels. I tend to do it every day, but something is stopping me from writing. I\u2019m looking forward to starting my own independent online business in the future as either a novelist or a screenwriter. I won\u2019t be able to be a productive writer and have a business if I\u2019m going to keep procrastinating and not deal with writer\u2019s block. Is there anything that I can do so I can keep on writing? Any advice or suggestions? I need some help.",

I remember we would even try to be rappers.. one of our favorite songs was Roxanne since this is social media I won't use her name. But Roxanne Roxanne' was the name of the song lol so I would say anything that you have found that calms you and takes you to another level of ease.",

Can\u2019t take a nap, can\u2019t play video games, can\u2019t fap, can\u2019t go to the fridge. Just me and the computer screen.",

I use it to motivate me to go to the gym, but you can definitely use it to help you to get back on the writing habit as well. The premise is that you need to send an evidence completing a task, or you lose money. So you could set it to send in a timelapse writing for 30 min everyday, for example, or you lose $10.",

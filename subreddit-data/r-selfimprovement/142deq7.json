    "postText": "For the last five years (since 2018) I have had no friends. None. Before that, I did have some friends, but I became very ill (heart issues, eating disorder, psychosis) and my mental state deteriorated rapidly, so I cut them off. Since then, I have had another problem of addiction, but I have been able to overcome it (now 500+ days clean).\n\nIn a couple of months' time, I will be starting college, and I feel this could represent a \"new beginning\" (to use a clich\u00e9). But I have no friends, and my social skills are terrible. I also find it very difficult to eat in front of others, and eating is of course one of the main ways people socialise at college.\n\nHowever, there are several months until I start college, and during this time I feel like it would be a very good idea to improve on myself, to improve my mental state. Does anyone have any idea of how I could improve myself? What I could work on? And on the first day of college, what should I do? I am used to being alone in massive crowds, but it is always very awkward and leaves me with a feeling of self-loathing. Any tips? Thank yoy",

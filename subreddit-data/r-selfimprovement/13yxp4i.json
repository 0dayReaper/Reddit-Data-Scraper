    "postText": "I have this problem where I will be at my low point and want to self-improve, do well at improving for a while, then fall back into my old ways. I\u2019ve been in this cycle for 1-2 years now and I just want to stick to being better.\n\n\r  \nMy low points consist of sitting on reels for multiple hours per day, not exercising consistently (Or at all), eating unhealthy food/buying takeaway, watching porn, drinking, and doing drugs. Each one of these things will act as a catalyst to set off the others. Although drugs are the worst. It will often cause me to speedrun turning my life into shambles. I have risked my job that I really enjoy by going in high or with 0 sleep after being up all night, I become lazy, don\u2019t do my chores, and end up becoming anxious and depressed. Although when I\u2019m doing well I don\u2019t crave drugs or alcohol, I will usually just have an impulse to do it and then can\u2019t stop myself.\n\n\r  \nThen when I decide to improve myself, I go to the gym consistently, eat healthy, have a good sleep schedule, get up early and go for walks, do well at work, write in my journal, enjoy finishing chores and feel great and confident about myself. This will last for about a month then I revert. \n\n\r  \nIt\u2019s like I either get bored with self-improvement and have to self-sabotage, forget how bad my low point can be or lie to myself that I have beaten my bad habits and have the discipline to stop when really, I don\u2019t. I fell off again a few weeks ago all because I had finished a big project at work, I was very happy with my consistency and I walked past a liquor store and the little voice in the back of my head said, \u201cMaybe I should have a drink to celebrate\u201d. And once I get these thoughts, I can\u2019t convince myself not to do it. Well obviously, that thought has spiralled into a rough couple of weeks for me.\n\n\r  \nI\u2019m at the tail end of this low point right now and I\u2019m starting to get everything back in order. I\u2019ve noticed that the last few times I\u2019ve tried to fix my life, I\u2019ve been telling myself that I\u2019ll probably fail or do a lot of negative self-talk. This time I am going to do the opposite and not allow myself to think \u201cwell its going to happen so may as well just give in\u201d. I\u2019ve deleted Instagram off my phone and after one week I\u2019ve lost the cravings for reels. I also don\u2019t subconsciously open my phone and go straight to Instagram anymore. I\u2019m writing in my journal again and this time I\u2019m going to not just write in the journal but also refer back to the past few low point entries where I have described how I want to change and why.\n\n\r  \nHas anyone else experienced this and reached a point where you were able to stick to your better lifestyle? And if so, was there anything that helped you stay focused and not go back to your old ways?\r  \n\n\nThanks in advance, sorry for the noval!",

Once you've pin pointed that issue you can start to address it. And hopefully it'll work for you. As there's no one solution for all.",

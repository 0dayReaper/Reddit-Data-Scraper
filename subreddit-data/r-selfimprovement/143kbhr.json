It also feels like i have to pretend something big is happening like I'm being enlightened when that didnt happen. If theres like a basic version of meditation that anyone can recommend where I could feel less uncomfortable about it that would be helpful. Thanks for reading.",

Just be alone, take a little something to calm your nerves, whatever that means for you, listen to a little peaceful music, and be at peace knowing that your prior fears that it would be embarrassing were unfounded, because it turns out there's no audience to feel embarrassed for.",

A time to just clear your mind of all the chaos going on and to not think about anything for a while. It\u2019s really helpful for when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed. Take 5 minutes, play a calming song you like or find one on YouTube, close your eyes and let the outside world fade into the background. Any time a thought comes up, notice it, and then let it leave your mind again. If you\u2019re having trouble with your thoughts, I always recommend focusing on your breath or your heart beat. Hope this helps!",

A part of it is i still associate stereotypical meditation when I think of meditation, like i remembering seeing people say \"ommm\" whenever mediation was shown on tv and that\u2019s cringy. I know thats not how most people actually do it but that image is in my head. I get if you dont understand why it feels embarrassing but its just the way i feel and i know im not the only one.",

If you don't, don't. \n\nLet go of these concrete ideas, and drop all expectations. Shit, just sit and be. That's meditation. There really is no right or wrong way. It's what works for you.",

            "comment": "There is no one right way to meditate. If you are picturing meditation only being in a certain position such as sitting up, with your legs crossed Indian style while placing your hands in mudras, you do not have to do it this way. You can even lie down while meditating or sit on a couch normally.\n\nThink of meditation as falling asleep while you are awake because that is basically what happens during meditation. We enter a different state of consciousness. You don't think sleeping looks stupid, do you? Probably not, because it's a natural human activity. Meditation can be seen in the same way.\n\nThere are also many different kinds of meditation. You may prefer a guided meditation that gives your thoughts some direction. This is more of an active meditation than a passive one. You could also try starting with a moving meditation if that is more your speed, such as something like yoga or even walking.\n\nJust becoming mindful of your breath also definitely puts you in a more meditative state. It is about relaxing and feeling by going inward. Nothing grand need happen and doesn't mean you're doing it wrong. It is like going into a trance -- the same thing we do every night whenever we fall asleep and dream. We just see dreaming as normal, because we all do it.",

            "comment": "Meditation is not a quick fix for you. It takes time and practice to see tangible improvements. Don\u2019t start with long times, but start with 2-3 minutes a day. There are good guided meditations on YouTube if you need that, but really just focus on your breathing for the 2 minutes. Your mind will wander at first, but that\u2019s ok. Just when you start drifting off, focus back on your breathing. I like to do long inhalations through my nose and longer exhalations through my mouth. Over time, you\u2019ll notice that your mind doesn\u2019t wander as often. After a few weeks, up your time to 5 minutes. A few weeks later, go to 10 if you want.  Now, I do a quick meditation before bed to clear my mind, and if I\u2019m feeling stressed or anxious, I\u2019ll do the focused breathing meditation in the morning and throughout the day. It\u2019s very helpful for stress. I blow out all stress with each exhalation. It works for me. There\u2019s nothing to feel embarrassed about, just don\u2019t expect immediate results.",

The closest thing I have found that actually helps (me) is running a hot bath with Dr. Teals Epsom salt (I use the coconut oil one) I light a candle, turn off the light. I have to literally say to myself \"feel the salt with your toes\". I do that. Then I say feel the hot water surrounding your back. I focus and feel that. Then I say \"feel the coconut oil nourishing your skin. I try to feel that. By that time I'm relaxed and try to mix my focus between them. I usually last 20 min. Then my brain is back and running. Maybe this helps?",

    "postText": "I\u2019m 19 and all my interactions with people feel unfulfilling. I usually rely on the other person to bring up interesting topics to discuss, because no matter how hard i try i just cannot think of what to say beyond asking them about their day or simple small talk. I find it difficult to talk about myself and I have been called boring by my friends before. \n\nI feel it much more now with my boyfriend because he is a very curious person and always has so many interesting thoughts and things to say that I would have never been able to think of. I really enjoy listening to him and i do ask questions and engage, but I feel insufficient because I cannot contribute in the same way. I rely on him to start all our conversation. Even if we watch a movie together, he will have interesting thoughts about it, but I struggle to notice things beyond the surface level. \n\nI think this has always been a problem. I remember learning things at school but never having questions for teachers, and struggling to think of what to say to people. The root of this is that I\u2019m not curious enough and I probably don\u2019t do any intellectually stimulating activities besides school work and social media. I feel like I have no original opinions and when I try to contribute towards conversation with my boyfriend, it always feels like I\u2019m repeating other people\u2019s ideas. I cannot usually answer deeper follow up questions he has because I never thought to find out more in the first place. My head is usually empty and I feel like I barely think. I don\u2019t have shower thoughts, or deep thoughts in general, beyond the basic noting my environment. \n\nHow do I train myself to be more curious and think deeper thoughts?",

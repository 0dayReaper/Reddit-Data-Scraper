Still when I'm around women I cant help myself doing things that make me look cool guy.\nLike I'm straight about my relationship priorities. Still I want girls to be attracted towards me and pay attention when I'm around.\nIts sick! \nI'm a sorta above average guy who genuinely gets that too.. but I just hate my tendency for being liked and entertained wherever I go..\n\nTo counter that, sometimes I think of intentionally doing sth ackward that would make me feel that they now truly dont want me..but this comes at the cost of my own self esteem\n\n\nHow can I get away from this attention seeking pattern?",

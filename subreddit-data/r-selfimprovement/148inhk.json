What are some examples they are guiding you in life choices?\n\nNot short:\n\nI\u2019ve been doing one exercise at therapy last time, at some point I had to think about my values. \n\nIt was very hard for me to frame something as a value. I feel like I\u2019ve been doing things in life out of fear or trying to escape something, or be near some people - in short to follow the desires of my trauma. \n\nNow I\u2019m trying to figure out myself. And have been thinking about values for a while. Need help and direction.",

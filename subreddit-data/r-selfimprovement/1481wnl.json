    "postText": "I have been really hating and beating myself up when I let people especially close friends treat me unfairly and I can\u2019t stand up for myself. I usually apologize for other people\u2019s wrong doings, and I feel sick afterwards because I put myself in a position where I made the other person\u2019s actions feel valid.\n\nI am the type of person who avoids conflicts and dramas. Apologizing for things have been the way for me to avoid making issues any bigger. \n\nI have a hard time calling people out for their actions, especially when those actions have affected me mentally and physically. \n\nAnd when I have the courage to speak up, not call them out, but speak up about what I am going through (clearly lowkey crying for help or comfort). They either laugh about it, take offense to it or tell me I\u2019m living my life wrong.\n\nI care way too much about other people to a point where I have a hard time saying no and I let myself go through things that affects me physically and mentally. It\u2019s hard to call people out because I either don\u2019t want them to get in trouble, feel bad or I just don\u2019t want to lose them.\n\n\nAnyone else have been in this road before?",

How did you deal with the thoughts of them hating you or thinking of you in a negative way for cutting them off from your life? \n\nWhen I cut people off my life, I end it with kindness. Like I would send them a message and like \u201cIf you\u2019re ever having a bad day or need someone to talk to, I\u2019m always here\u201d or like take them for dinner, talk and tell each other that that there\u2019s a lot of learning and growing, without bringing up any negativity in the conversation. \n\nUnfortunately, somehow somewhat I feel dumb for not going all off, speaking up the truth and letting the other person aware of their actions. I can\u2019t go back and tell them about it, it\u2019s so hard to move on knowing I didn\u2019t stand up for myself. Now I want to learn how to do it without feeling bad or worried, so I know what to do in the future.",

They always made it where i was overreacting or they were the victim. And every time i believed them. And then one day with some help from my wife I just burned the bridges. I didn't tell them. I just cut ties. Blocked them on everything. Made new accounts. Got a new number. Yes every once a while they will find my new accounts and try to get a hold of me. It's been a year since I did it and every once a while my head will say maybe they are different now but then I think about how they made me feel and how I feel now. Sometimes you have to just stop talking to them because no words are going to change anything. Sometimes you just have to pour gas on the bridge and light the match.",

It was kind of fortunate that she pushed me to my breaking point I guess. At the ripe age of 20.\n\nLately, I've been learning how to be emotionally honest. That means being \"problematic\" and announcing when you disagree with shit or if it hurts your own feelings.\n\nTruth is, you're probably holding onto someone who just doesn't exist. They never did. Their goodness you see and the good times do not last because power is their prerogative. And every time you talk to them you'll have to remind yourself not to give them personal information.\n\nSpending your time where it is appreciated, respected, and needed is entirely underrated. But it's extremely uncomfortable building habits to get there.\n\nBut I will be honest, I didn't gain respect from anyone until I started learning to be selfish and learning to be an asshole to get points across. I had to do it wrong before I got it right, too. I had to cuss people out and simply refuse to acknowledge them. I had to demand that my pain be seen. That I was humiliated for most my life to put someone else up a peg or two. I still struggle a lot, but finding yourself means dropping the stepping stool version of you that others have forced you to be. You're not you like that.\n\nYou will literally grieve them and yourself.\n\nAnd ironically, people pleasing is emotionally untrustworthy. This'll bleed into your intimate life if you don't stop this cycle. Inevitably. And you will be broken to it.\n\nMy perspective comes from abuse, but it applies to any hierarchy of social power really. People just suck until they realize you're a person too.",

It may seem like healthier people may feel that we are unworthy because they are so worthy, but the opposite actually happens. \u201cWorthy\u201d people feel free to give compliments and affirm others. \n\nNot everyone has the ability to speak of themselves as honestly as you have.

Speaking up about how I feel and what I\u2019m going through without making the other person feel attacked is something that I have learned growing up, I used to fight fire with fire which makes me look as bad as they are. Sometimes I wish I had that fire so I could point out their flaws or wrong doings, but now I realized doing that only makes the situation worse. Not a lot of people like hearing their own flaws, so sometimes making them aware about how their actions affects other people is the only way for me to deal with people like that.\n\nI think now I just need to learn how to walk away without having the thoughts of \u201cI wish I could\u2019ve said that\u201d or \u201cHe still didn\u2019t get it, he\u2019s still not aware of what he did wrong, I need to say something\u201d.

The truth is that progress isn\u2019t really that perfectly linear(or exponential). It\u2019s two steps forward, one step back, maybe 5 steps foreword another day. \n\nThis applies in almost every aspect of life I\u2019d say. I trust the system to take care of me at work, at school, at the gym, at home, etc. if I honor the practice. Get the ball rolling, and the rest will take care of itself. And also, by honoring the practice today, it sets me up for more success tomorrow. That is why the curve is exponential. \n\nNo one lifts 37.8x more after going to the gym for a year, but my focus is doing my 1% at the gym today, not the rest of the year. And in 365 days I trust I\u2019ll be better than I was today, not because I worked out super hard once, but I showed up, I took the step, 365 times. I can\u2019t measure 1% but I can measure showing up, taking that step, and and smashing my days one day at a time.",

(Obviously you will run up against natural limits eventually!)\n\nYou can also get in positive feedback loops which aren't necessarily exponential but do pick up steam.  E.g. start losing weight which makes exercise more fun which helps you lose more weight which motivates you to eat even healthier which motivates you to learn how to cook which improves your social life etc.",

            "comment": "I love James clear's points about compounding. Almost all important aspects of life are affected by compounding. Relationships and knowledge are two excellent examples. If you work on building strong, quality relationships, those people in your network will refer you to other good people so the initial time you spend building a relationship helps you build your network in the future. Same idea with knowledge- the more you know about, the more you can connect new ideas together with knowledge you already have. Once you have a large knowledge base, learning about one new thing actually has more value than just the one new thing because you can see how it relates to other ideas which helps form new ideas. Compounding is talked about all the time in finance, but rarely in other areas even though it's such an important and helpful concept. You want to spend your time on things that compound rather than things that just give a set amount of pleasure or whatever else, because compounding things will pay bigger dividends down the road. Watching tv doesn't compound, you just get entertainment in exchange for time spent watching. Reading a book does compound because it increases your knowledge which impacts many factors of your life.",

Look at the performance of any athlete that can be measured objectively. The more additional effort you put in, as you improve, the less positive results you get.\n\nIf you run a mile in 15 minutes, and put a little effort, you can quickly get down to 10 minutes. If you already run a 7 minute mile, it takes a lot of work to get down to 6.\n\nIf you already run a five minute mile, it will take an insane amount of effort to get down to four minutes... And you probably never ever will. Worse, if you stop training, you will lose your ability to run a five minute mile. And if you keep training forever, you will still get slower as your age.\n\nIt's not just sports, it's everything. Countless studies show that humans, almost all of us, are terrible at retaining knowledge. If you take a class in.... statistics right now, get an A+ and then don't use that knowledge daily, in no time at all you will forget almost all of it.\n\nHabits don't compound, this is just mental masturbation for people who want to feel good without accomplishing anything of substance.",

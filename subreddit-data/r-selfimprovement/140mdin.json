    "postText": "I\u2019m way too nice to people, I have a hard time saying no, standing up and speaking up for myself. I always find myself being the first one to reach out and say \u201cHey I know we had a rough day today, wanna grab something to eat and talk about it?\u201d. I\u2019ve never seen my friend take the first step, especially since he\u2019s always at fault. \n\nI always find myself apologizing for things I don\u2019t need to apologize for. After being in this toxic friendship, I realized a lot about myself and how I let others take advantage of me. I have completely cut him off now because now I am aware of his mindset and how he treats other people. I wanted to tell him about his flaws, about how he lets his insecurities take over him and project that negativity towards other people. But knowing him and how he takes things the wrong way, I just didn\u2019t say anything and moved on with my life. \n\nI am beating myself up for not saying anything but part of me is glad I didn\u2019t, because he could\u2019ve used my own words and use it against me telling everybody that I\u2019m calling him insecure. So I am glad I didn\u2019t say anything. He was also trying to take credit for my self development for apologizing after an issue we had when he got mad at me for covering my nose when his athlete\u2019s foot was next to my face. I didn\u2019t say anything and continued doing my business on my iPad, he was the one who questioned me \u201cWhat? my feet stinks?\u201d and I replied \u201cYes but it\u2019s fine it\u2019s not that bad you just need to wash it\u201d. I\u2019m sorry but you wouldn\u2019t ask that to a stranger in the bus. Later he accused me of being upset with him saying \u201cyour feet f**king stinks\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve never smelled anything smell so f**king bad before\u201d\n\nI already cut him out of my life, it just sucks how he has affected my relationship with our friends, antagonized me and made me look like a bad guy. At this point, I just want to cut off everybody, focus on myself and find the right people to hangout with.",

Studying for 13 hours straight demands so much time, energy and effort that hardly any human being can do it, and certainly not for multiple days in a row, unless they're on some kind of hard core drug. \n\nRather aim to study for a limited period of time and put away your phone and any other distractions.",

I used to dick around most days but getting a good productive study day in is such a great feeling :)\n\nJust remember, take into consideration not only the quantity of study (how man hours), but the quality as well. I recommend reading or getting the audiobook of Cal Newport's \"Deep Work\" for more on this. 13 hours of on/off, distracted, or passive studying (reading, highlighting, watching lectures in the background) may not bring as good results as shorter sessions (I do 2-3 x 3 hours on weekdays) of deep work and active studying (writing notes and summaries, practice problems, spaced repetition flash cards, etc.). Or do whatever works best for you as long as you're hyper-focused and gaining a better understanding of the topic you're learning. \n\nDon't forget to set realistic study goals each day and give yourself a break when you feel like you've hit a wall. Good luck!",

And your mind and body need balance in order to be sustainable.\n\nHere's what I did in grad school, that was a game changer: I treated it like a 9-5 (well, 10-6). Monday to Friday, work for 8 hours with a lunch break and a couple coffee breaks. You'll be astounded by how much you get done (far more, it turns out, than my classmates who went hard for long hours sporadically), and you'll still have evenings and weekends to enjoy. Honestly, I didn't \\*need\\* all the time I had to study and write in a week, but planning it that way meant that if I knocked off early on Friday or went to the gym Tuesday morning, it easily accounted for it.\n\nYou've got this!",

    "postText": "Having a good sense of humour is touted to be one of the best tools ever - for making friends, attracting partners, and in general just getting by in life. It's kind of a miserable experience without it.\n\nAnd yet, some of us aren't really natural jokers, cannot conjure a good joke on command and/or just be funny.  \nMaybe it's because they were raised to take life seriously all the time, maybe they don't find many things funny or at least not the same as the majority of folks, maybe they're suffering from something else.  \nOr maybe they *really* want to, but it's out of their hands and their only hope is that they can *stumble* onto a funny moment and make it last!  \nI'm one of those people, sadly (the last one specifically).\n\nI've often been the serious one (others would say \"mature\", I disagree because maturity and being funny *can* coexist in the same person). I wouldn't really indulge in humour, trying to find the funny side of everything, or just laughing even for no other reason at all than the sake of it.\n\nBut I have recognised the importance and benefits of laughter, and I keep reading/being told that being funny really does a good number on your social life, let alone getting someone interested in you. The more I progress and continue on my journey to grow and improve as a person, the more I want to make this a part of me - like, I don't *need* to be funny all the time, but I *want* to be funny when I want to, especially when it's the best time for it.  \nAnd it's not like I can't be. Or people wouldn't find me funny at all. My friends do; strangers find me pleasant at least, but sometimes I push the right buttons and they find me incredibly amusing.\n\nI have often lived as a people pleaser. Still do sometimes. I'm trying to drop that habit. But I'm getting a huge kick out of making people laugh and have fun, and obviously being a funny, witty person makes it so much easier.\n\nI just can't do it on command!\n\nPerhaps some folks who are good at it, or have learned to, have anything to share?",

You can also find out what comedians make you laugh the most and what it is you like about their comedy. You mentioned wittiness, what does wittiness look like to you? Is there a pattern in the type of circumstance that makes you laugh the most? What would the subtext be?",

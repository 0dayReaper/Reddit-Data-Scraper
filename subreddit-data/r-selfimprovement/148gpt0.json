    "postText": "Just take the little effort of 30 seconds to read through these 4 points to change your life.\n\n**Practice Deep Breathing:** Deep breathing exercises can help activate the body's relaxation response and reduce anxiety. Take slow, deep breaths in through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat this several times whenever you feel anxious.\n\n**Challenge Negative Thoughts:** Challenge and reframe negative thoughts that contribute to anxiety. Replace them with more positive and realistic statements. For example, if you find yourself thinking, \"I can't handle this,\" reframe it as, \"I may feel overwhelmed, but I have overcome challenges before, and I can do it again.\"\n\n**Engage in Regular Exercise:** Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood boosters. Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine, whether it's going for a walk, practicing yoga, or engaging in a sport you enjoy. Exercise can help reduce anxiety and improve your overall well-being.\n\n**Practice Self-Care:** Prioritize self-care activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction. This can include taking a bath, practicing mindfulness or meditation, listening to calming music, reading a book, or spending time in nature. Taking care of yourself physically and emotionally can have a positive impact on reducing anxiety.\n\nRemember, everyone's journey with anxiety is unique, and it's important to find what works best for you. If your anxiety persists or becomes overwhelming, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor. They can provide additional guidance and support tailored to your specific needs.",

Even back then I remember there being contention over the concept of a biochemical model explaining away anxiety as a chemical imbalance. Could what you are talking about not just be a body over-responding to anxiety rather than it being quite literally no reason at all. \n\nFor example, one person might be having a relatively threat free day but are in the midst of an important semester in their schooling. While the individual experiencing the anxiety might not be consciously thinking about that. It's still something in the back of the mind. While someone else might be at a 1/10 anxiety level in the same scenario. The other type of person you are describing will be sitting at a 7/10 due to their over or under production of specific chemicals. In the end their is still an external factor involved. I'm just not so sure I can understand the concept of a reason-less anxiety response. \n\nI don't disagree that someone might have more aggressive biological responses to anxiety. What I'm more skeptical of is the supposed order and root of anxiety. \n\nI hope I'm not coming off as being contrarian for the sake of it. I myself have a clinical diagnosis and am genuinely curious about how our minds function in this regard. I've just always found that if I'm completely honest with myself, my anxiety is always rooted in something past/future related, more than it ever is just absolutely random.",

But like how the body can malfunction diabetes, heart issues, joint issues, respiratory and muscular issues, the brain is just as capable of having disorders that without certain hard set lifestyle choices and medications there is no resolving.\n\nI'm bipolar and without my medications I would be in a constant extreme states of fights or flight. However, most people that know me know me as the calm laid back guy. I get good sleep exercise regularly. I go to therapy,  journal, meditate, have good social networks and hobbies and relationships.\n\nBut my brain will always be a malfunctioning one and without medical intervention of medication, no level of healthy coping skills will ever bring it to a healthy baseline.\n\nJust like someone with diabetes can't change the way their body interacts with sugar, I can never change the way my brain interacts within itself, myself, and the world around me. \n\nSchizophrenics are the same way. Their brains will never run correctly without medicine. So to say that all brains will run well when you get the external factors has already been disproven medically with so many examples of mentally ill conditions.",

I've always naturally had enough autonomous wiggle room mentally to identify and differentiate my reactions from my choices.\n\nI guess I can never truly experience the uncontrollable and excessive top-down processing someone with schizophrenia might experience on a daily basis and the lack of thought autonomy that might come with that. The closest I've come to that feeling is a few psychedelic experiences where my conclusions on things seemed to vastly outrunning my ability to catch-up with and verify those conclusions. Clearly those 2 aren't the exact same thing. But I think there some aspects of schizophrenia that can be made somewhat understandable through a heavy dose of a psychedelic substance.\n\nAnyway, I appreciate you giving your honest opinion on the matter. It's given me things to reconsider. Peace!",

Most of us are hiding from our own fears and have many self-defense mechanisms protecting ourselves from the parts of us we don't want to face.\n\nIt's not something to be taken lightly. Anxiety in many cases is just inner friction between one side of ourselves trying to get to point b from a and the other part of us resisting because we can't handle the sight of where we truly stand. Instead we present ourselves with a version of ourselves that we can stomach even if means being in denial.\n\nBut don't let absence of anxiety fool you into thinking that it is absolutely healthy.  One can be quite delusional and experience very little anxiety. Ego is a very convenient tool in this regard. Lessening anxiety can be good if it is getting in the way of your forward momentum in life. But NO anxiety can be equally harmful. You shouldn't be trying to 'delete' anxiety. Anxiety is a normal part of life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: this sub really has an issue with the whole 'quick fix' mentality. Lot of fellas be watching too many of those silly Billy Mays infomercials throughout their lifetime. None of this stuff gets done over night. These are years long endeavors. You think psychiatric professionals who have been helping others for decades don't experience anxiety too? Come on. One of the better things people here can do is realize self-improvement is some of the hardest work you can do. If it were as easy as many are making it out to be, the world wouldn't be in the condition its in.",

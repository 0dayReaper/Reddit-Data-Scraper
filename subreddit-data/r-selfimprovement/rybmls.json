    "postText": "This applies to both men and women alike.\n\nInstead of chasing your dream guy or girl and falling short, do the exact opposite. Don't chase. At all.\n\nTake a step back and work on yourself. If you want to attract an attractive man or woman, you need to become attractive yourself.\n\nFocus on what you can control, not what you can't. And there is **SO MUCH** you can control, if you apply the proper discipline:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) **Fitness** \\- Eat clean and train mean. Work on your physical body and not only will you look better, you will feel better and feel more confident\n\n2) **Education** \\- It doesn't have to be just college. Keep learning. Read as much as possible. You can learn an entire life's worth of lessons (from numerous biographies) in a span of a few hours. That's a bargain. Take it and apply it.\n\n3) **Hobbies** \\- Can really be anything honestly. Find what you like and invest in it! You like to cook? Learn to cook better. Passionate about rock climbing. Then keep rock climbing! Are you a gamer? Game with others and build relationships as a result. It can be anything honestly. The important thing here is that you enjoy what you do because a true passion is super interesting no matter what it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBe your biggest advocate. Invest in yourself. I promise you that if you do the above, especially #1 and #2, you won't have to chase as much. People will chase you.\n\nStay hungry. Stay focused. You got this.",

It's night and day compared to last year. The issue is I feel like I'm only 55-60 percent done. \n\nIn fall I'd like to have lost another 20 pounds to put myself around 160, I would like to be a lot better at all of my hobbies, and I would like to have developed some more career skills (I graduated with a degree in stats and I want to learn some more programming skills). \n\nThat would put me at about 80-85 percent \"done\"\n\nI don't think I'll ever be at 100 percent because the ambition of chasing that is what keeps me going but I'll be happy with myself after I get to 90 percent. \n\nSorry that was very long I'm sure.

Chasing implies there's something to be gained that you wouldn't view as easy to get.\n\nWe have to eliminate that thinking. We aren't trying to chase or win a prize here. There isn't a competition. People don't have a difficulty setting, we need to learn how to live life. Make close connections.\n\nIf you are interested in someone, the only way you begin to chase is if you begin to think that you need to get them to like you. No. You need to find out if you like them and why that is, focus on having a good time and getting closer to that person. Express that to them and keep open and honest communication too. If they feel the same way, great. If not, great. We're on the same page at the end of the day and everyone is happy.",

When improving ourselves we try to increase our \"value\" in order to people outside to appreciate us somehow and try to be with us. There is something deeply flawed in this reasoning. We are not commodities and reading books or improving our looks for the ultimate goal of being connected to the rest of society is unfair and shalllow (not saying it is you.)\n\nI believe we should do things because we like them or because we consider valuable, end of the conversation. Not because of \"improving\" ourselves or becomming \"attractive\". If anything try to become attractive to yourself and thats it. Read out of curiosity, engage in sports clubs because you love the sport and do fitness to challenge your body and yourself nothing more. \n\nBeing attractive to people is a side bonus, never forget that people. Also, OP, maybe I said the same thing you said, sorry I am not good at explaining myself.",

I had to learn that skill too. I've never been in a relationship or done anything physical yet with a Women, but I can 100% say I am way better off now then I was when I had this realization. \n\nTalking to women isn't scary anymore and quiet easy, I just still have a lot to learn.\n\nAll I'm saying is, I really regret getting on that \"invest in yourself\" mindset and life style so early and for so long. There is more to life then your self, and it's OK to want a relationship. \n\nThe good thing about this lifestyle though, is that I know I can be OK by myself and with myself. If I ever do get the chance of being in a relationship and it fails, I now know ill be OK alone because I've done it for so long and have mastered this skill.",

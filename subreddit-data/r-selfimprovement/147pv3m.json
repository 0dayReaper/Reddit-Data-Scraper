    "postText": "When I say loser, I realize the first thing that comes to mind is to say \"stop calling yourself a loser.\" Objectively though,  I am pretty woefully behind in every year of my life. \n\n* I am 26 years old and live in a tiny low-income apartment with my mother.\n* I have difficulty holding a job, my current job is a boring government position that makes me depressed just talking about with someone else.\n* I have absolutely zero friends. In my entire life I've never gotten close to people. I have no social skills. When I try to have a conversation with someone in a bar, I just clam up.\n* Appearance wise, I am overweight (even more so since starting an office position), balding, ever since I reached my mid-twenties I've developed deep forehead wrinkles. I have no fashion sense. I would rate my overall attractiveness at about a 3 where I am right now.\n* I am constantly negative. This habit is so deeply ingrained in me that it's become an unfortunate part of my identity. I often dump about everything wrong in my life and all the regrets and guilt that have built up in me over the years, to the point that I drive people away that were otherwise interested in me.\n\nAt this late age, I feel like all these issues have built up to the point it will take years to reverse, if I am ever able to. I truly want to be someone who is desirable, who doesn't drive people away for being the way he is.",

So I am going to prioritize building that.\n- I am taking classes to change careers.\n- I no longer live with my parents, but I have 2 other roommates. \n- I also started balding, just buzzed my head. \n- Dressing better has also been a challenge. A button up shirt with jeans and sneakers makes me feel like a neck beard but that's just what I have been doing for casual days.\n- I have been going to the gym consistently in the last year. I am making decent progress, but I am a hard gainer so it's been slow.\n2) As my self confidence improves, I am going to start building my social skills. I do have a few good friends, but I have social anxiety which usually screws up my attempts at making new ones. It takes me too long to open up to people. \n- Therapy sessions have so far been pretty crappy. I am still trying to find a good therapist. \n- Journaling has been working in the meantime. Just sitting and writing things down that I think are important. \n\nMost of my friends are late bloomers also. I think I'm even further behind them, but I have goals that by 30 I'll feel better about who I am and where my life is going. Good luck man\ud83d\udc4d",

Learn how to learn - I used the book Make It Stick \n\n2. Learn how to practice - I used The Practicing Mind\n\n3. Learn how to learn from failure - I used Black Box Thinking\n\nIf you take the time and practice these skills, you'll build a mental model for how skill-building is done.\n\nAfter that, I would focus on foundational skills.\n\n1. Emotional Intelligence - how to become comfortable in social interaction.\n\n2. Social Intelligence - how to git gud at social interaction.\n\nFrom there, it's up to you to decide. \n\nI explored masculinity over the winter and emerged a more internally-congruent man. That's what was important to me.\n\nNow I'm working on honing my social skills and learning unrelated skills like scheduling (ADHD got me like -).\n\n\nI'm a born loser, man, and I know the pain. I also know it's hard to see it ever changing.\n\nWhen you walk down this path, you're going to encounter fog so thick that you can't see two steps in front of you. \n\nYou'll want to turn back. \n\nBut just know this: if you keep walking, eventually you will come out the other side.\n\nAnd if you are relentless, your success will be inevitable. Sometime between 26 and 30, you **will** transform. The brain will build on whatever input you keep giving it.\n\nThe magic of your mind is that it doesn't judge. If you tell it a bunch of negative thoughts about yourself, the mind is going to say, \"OK!\", and act accordingly.\n\nIf you tell it positive things, it's going to do the same thing. You just have to learn to interpret the world differently.\n\nThat takes time and practice. The mind would rather stay the same. It's invested a lot of energy into these neural connections and it wants to keep them going.\n\nYou basically have to build a parallel road that leads to better outcomes and the only way to do that is to literally do it.\n\nOvertime, the old ways fade.\n\nThe mind is an incredible tool and most of us let it run on its default settings.\n\nIf you choose to take charge and learn to apply it, you can achieve your wildest dreams.",

That's better than most.\n\nIncrease your DAILY activity level.   15 minutes of activity that you can talk during, but can't sing.   Walking a little faster, going up and down stairs.   1 month of that and you WILL feel better.   Escalate the activity a little more, 30-45 min at a gym.   (Don't start there, you need the 1 month conditioning-that's your heart, though at 25, you probably won't discern the difference.)\n\nOrder you A set of new clothes.   ONE set, you are going to be somebody different in 3 months---and they won't fit.  A workout set, a going out set and a work set.   Go to a cologne store and find a scent that you like and want to BE.   Shower everyday and after exertion, and apply.\n\nLook at your diet.  Get rid of sugar drinks.  Cold Turkey.  For me, it was sweet tea and soda.      Drink at least a gallon of water a day.  You will have headaches.  It will suck.  they go away after a few weeks.\n\nafter a few months you can try artificial zero calorie sweeteners.   All of them have side effects and a billion studies funded by big sugar.   None of the side effects are as bad as diabetes or the residual effects of obesity.   (Alzheimers, I'd advise not worrying too much about, if you get it, you won't know it.)  \n\nI lost 48 pounds in 5 months JUST from eliminating soda and sweet tea.(I was drinking 3-5k calories per day).  (I did increase my activity level by minimum 15-45 minutes per day---that translates to about 125 calories burned, at best---you CANNOT outrun a bad diet...and sweet drinks are the epitome of a bad diet.)",

Getting in shape, early stages of attraction/dating are superficial initially most of them time.  So you are out of the game almost immediately if you are out of shape. I lost 60lbs in the last two years, there\u2019s a significant difference in how people treat you guys and girls tbh. It may sound unfair but it\u2019s the world that we live in. Don\u2019t beupset by that, take advantage of it.  \nYou also have better energy levels and less stress when you exercise regularly. It checks so many boxes, and it\u2019s cheap to do. \n\n2. Fix your pattern of negative thoughts. Sounds like a form of anxiety. Maybe some therapy would help with that but no matter how desirable you maybe externally if your mental state is bad it will not matter \n\n3. Figuring out your path forward towards career/moving out.This is important you don\u2019t have to be making 6 figures but you need to have some sort of plan you are working towards and making progress on. Living at home with your Mom is going to be a huge barrier for you.",

Lets say you are operating at 10% of your potential. If could improve to 20% of your potential, that is a 100% increase. You don't need to reverse yourself COMPLETELY in order to become more attractive, charismatic, fit, etc. Just slight lifestyle changes will make a massive improvement.\n\nThe first thing you can do that requires no money is force yourself to interact with people. Make eye contact. Smile. Focus on them rather than yourself. Listen more than speak. The mindset always needs to be \"How can I bring value to this person's life?\" Try different methods. Fuck around with it. \n\nStop JUST working a job. Find a way to provide value with a product or service (I wash windows) and go do that on weekends until you are making enough money you can quit your job. Its more fulfilling.\n\nIgnore the pain of effort. Its the price you pay to be great. Stop letting pain be an excuse for laziness.\n\nStop thinking. Start doing.\n\nJoin some sort of sport or activity where the workout is the secondary objective, not the main objective. For example, I am a Muay Thai fighter. I fight for sport, and the workout is secondary to the fighting. So its still fun and exciting and not a mind-numbing activity.\n\nClean up your diet. If you don't want to cook, at least spend your money on better fast food like fresh foods, not deep fried, or something like that. Or hire someone to cook for you. Or only cook two times a week or whatever is manageable. Also, just eat incrementally less.\n\nUse google to find fashion trends. As your fitness gets better, clothes start looking better on you. Cut your hair, get hair implants or embrace the balding and shave 'er off. Oh, and keep yourself groomed and clean.\n\nStop being a loser. Losers lose, winners win. Start winning at little shit in your life and you will start winning at bigger things in life.\n\nLove yourself.",

So have a good look in the mirror, tell yourself you will no longer be holding yourself back from reaching your better self, tell yourself you\u2019re done not progressing forward, tell yourself that you\u2019re done daydreaming about a better version of you, its time, right now is the time, lets f*^king GO. the new you is waiting \ud83d\udd25, GET TO IT \ud83d\ude24",

Compare yourself to how you were yesterday and go from there. Make progress an intrinsic project rather than a game of comparison with others.\n\nThis is the most important realisation of my life, maybe it helps you too. Its about learning how to love yourself - and now you might think that is just a esotheric saying. But everything we do is based on habits. And being constantly negative like you said is a habit. It is so ingrained into your being because you have been doing it so consistently. The only logical way of dealing with a bad habit is by trying to replace it with a good one. But here is what most people dont get. You don't need to change your whole persona in a single day, in fact expecting yourself to do so is only setting yourself up for failure. Think about it like training a muscle in the gym.. you have to go and train **consistently** in order for anything to develop - it takes time and effort. That is for sure. So in order to gain a more positive outlook on things you need to put in some effort to THINK more positively too. There is always a bright side to things (well, not always but you know, the song and stuff) and if you are for example your own biggest critic, which I certainly am, then you also need to be your biggest cheerleader sometimes. The way you talk to yourself is very important for your \"default\" mindset. Understanding this and reading a bunch of book helped me to work on similar issues than you have right now. And it sucks and takes a lot of effort, but it is so fucking worth it you cant even imagine.\n\nNobody will do it for you, if you literally dont change a thing then nothing will ever change for the better. Nobody gives a shit about whether or not you change things. You need to give a shit. That is the whole point about it.\n\nHow to get there is up to you. Reading helped me, a lot of build up frustration I learned to channel into my workouts instead of dwelling on it and becoming more and more cynical and negative, focusing on my passions rather than expectations of others.n\n\nI could write a book about it, but it needs to click with you first before any of those can really fulfill their potential of really helping you.",

            "comment": "Sounds like you have deep depression, which is affecting your health. But I can tell you that things can and will get better.\n\nRather than focus on what you don't have, or can't do, look deeply at the things you can do, and may be things that you can aspire to do; things that are your own. In order to live your full life as a human being you have to build and live your life in your own way, and stop measuring yourself against others.\n\nHere are some things you can do:\n\n1. Take daily walks. Being alone and getting some form of exercise is important. If you have a little bit of money, invest in a nice pair of walking or hiking shoes. You can do this no matter where you live, in the city, or even in the woods. Get in touch with your senses, sight, sound, smell, touch. You will discover an appreciation of Mother Earth, animals and even people.\n2. Control your information diet. Stay away from negative social media, and news; things that make you jealous, envious, and angry, stay away from those.\n3. Become a member of your local library, if you can. Carry a book with you, and read a few pages, rather than scroll through social media. Books will slow down your racing mind, and calm you down.\n4. Practice small breathing exercises when you wake up and before you go to sleep, for a short time, 5 minutes or so. Focus on your breathing, and send yourself some love and gratitude.\n5. Being with your mother is a great thing, even now. You will look back at this time with her years down the line with great fondness. Try to let her know that you appreciate her from time to time. Trust me, your future mates and friends will respect that.\n6. Don't be in a hurry to make big changes overnight. Big changes come from small changes. As long as you keep making small changes to improve yourself, you will be fine in the greater ark of life.\n7. Lastly, be kind to yourself, even if you feel like you are failing. Slow down, and try agin, perhaps with a different approach.\n\nGood luck!",

Got a raise.   Got a promotion in that year. +1%+1%+1%)\n\nEaxh tiny step forward on its own means nothing but when they stack she is in a completely different lifestyle and beyond happy with her changes!! (down 100 lbs to date. 8 lbs of her goal of 150  for a breasts reduction which will help her back.\n\n\nYou can change one little thing today.  Pick any tiny little habit or choice.  And stick with it until it is second nature and can roll into another habit (you mentioned negative thoughts.  Maybe start with one of those?)\n\n\nYou won't notice the growth until you hit a point where everything takes off!!!!  But it does.   And now my ex wife is my inspiration to get my life on track.

You might want to force yourself to regularly be in a position where you HAVE to engage with people but you don\u2019t have to talk about yourself. \n\nDo you have any charitable organizations where you can volunteer your time?

This will work wonders for your mental health, energy and confidence. \n\nThis will also build discipline and transfer to other aspects of life, Like being able to not only hold a job but move up. You are more likely to be treated seriously if you take care of yourself and will have more opportunities to move up in life. \n\nStop talking negative to yourself, this has a massive impact on your mental health and this alone will keep you where you are. You need to treat yourself like the person you want to be. \n\nAnd finally get your money up, learn a useful skill if you don't have one. I suggest you get out of your comfort zone Get a job on a construction site where you are surrounded by other men. This will help you socialize and not be as awkward. (Not necessary but try to surround yourself with other men that are in a good place in their life.) But learning a trade is a sure fire way to get yourself out of being broke and can be done with little to no education most can be learned on the job.\n\nMake an effort to talk to people beyond what is needed no matter how awkward it may be. \n\nLike talking to the cashier at the grocery store, talk about the weather, how good the produce is there, how great the item you found on sale is. Literally anything. \n\nThere are numerous things you can do but this is a good starting point.\n\nGood Luck I wish you the best. I know how you feel and it will get better.",

Mindfulness is focusing only what is going on right at this moment with and ignoring you future and  your past. \n\n We all have a lot of feelings and it's hard to recognize them when you are worried about your past present and future.  Focusing on what's going on with you right at this minue. Helps you to recognize and cope with the emotions you have.right now.  It's too over whelming to try to deal with all your emotions past , present and future,  so focus instead of what your feeling right now. So start with just this very moment.\n\nI know Mindfulness is hard.  I work at it every day. myself. I'm a work in progress. From your post your disappointed in the way your life has been. You are very observent.  You don't like living with your Mom.  Have you applied for Section 8 Housing for yourself? Section 8 Housing is Low Income Housing that is even iin Guam and Hawaii.\n\nBaldness and wrinkles show you have Character. I call them Battle wounds, from living. There is nothing wrong with them You just have to remember not to compare yourself to other people and learn to appreciate and a ccept who you are, and what you are like. Acceptance rather than finding fault with yourself is really hard. Anything worthwhile is hard.\n\nYour overweight. I am too I have Diabetes. Again, I am practcing \"Mindfulness.\" I'm focusing on eating right one meal at a time. I may not succeed, but it's try try try again until I can succeed.\n\nSocialization too. Why do you clam up?  What have you learned about it? What can you do about it? Right in this moment. Acceptanc of yourself is very important. If your not happy with your ability to Socialize. Accept that feeling and do something aboout it. Read a book on it. Look on the net. Talk to your Mom about it. Learn as much as you can. Then go out and try again.\n\n  Howard Sternt the Radio Personality has written books. \"Miss America\" is my favorite because he really went all out to expressing himself. He opened up to people. He taught me how to. say things that I dare I wouldn't  He really helped me with Socailization.\n\n  How, interviews people. Try when your talking to people to do it like Howard interviewis  them. Your going to make mistakes. That's okay Making mistakes that to a perfectioist is the Kiss of Death, but if you keep trying and tryng and trying you will eventually become the person you want to be.  Thanks for posting.

The issue here is the loser mindset which is the whole point of not calling yourself a loser. \n\nWhat is a desirable man to you and why do you wish to become such? Do you want what actually comes out of being a desirable man or rather the social aesthetics of being one? Is this the only thing you want out of life? \n\nI highly recommend some mental help with that type of negative thinking. Even if not extreme, it is highly recommended as it indicates other underlining issues. They can also help sort out a way for you to move away to doing things you actually like rather than living in this type of misery. In said discussions with them or whichever way you get to answering this negativity, get to doing things you would actually like doing. After sorting out the negativity and starting to do things for yourself, you can then start to get involved in the social circles. \n\nWhen involved with the social circles, go for people who share the common interest or compatible interests. Most will come and go, but some may stick around. See about keeping those who stick around. Don't let any fear deter you from talking with other people. They have fears and other emotions no different from yourself. \n\nFor the weight, what exactly is your diet? Are you eating a lot of carb and sugar rich food? How often do you exercise? Consider changing your diet and definite start doing regular cardio. Do a run of at least a few miles a day and you will definitely lose weight even with a bad diet. If can't do the running right now, start walking more. \n\nFor balding, you can change your hair style to make the balding seem good as some people manage to do, wear a hat or something over it, cut all your hair off, or make investments to get products or hair implants to reverse the balding and more. You have a lot of options on that. \n\nProducts that deal with wrinkling exist and you can also work around having them being supplementary with your appearance. \n\nKeep your job for now and save up. Do you have educational background in anything? Consider what type of career you would like to have. There are numerous different options. You can do certain trade trainings with the right connections and do quite decently financially with many people enjoying what they do. You can go to college and go somewhere like law, medicine, engineering, computer science, medicine, and more. Often based on what it is you like to do. This also goes hand to hand in moving out of your current place as well, so focus mostly on this before you try to leave. Once moving out, ensure you have a good amount saved up for whatever down payment you would need to give a landlord to wherever you move to along with a stable income to pay for the said rent. Or you can also buy places and have low interest rates on your mortgage. A lot of options on moving out as well. \n\nI say get fashion sense once you are financially stable and go based on what you like. Don't just go for some type of fashion as it is what other guys wear or it is what the guys that get attention wear. For now, focus on your health before making other drastic changes.",

Work on becoming happy person. Someone who know his values and it\u2019s emotionally mature (read books). Learn to communicate. Have desire and goals. (Not to impress other but because you actually want it) \n\nIf you work on all that, your appearance will change your, energy will change. You will become attractive to the right eyes.\n\nMore importantly you will be satisfied and content with life. That\u2019s attractive in my opinion\n\nOff balance by Matthew is a good book",

Even a 86 y/o person can still be youthful.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s no problem with living with your mom if that\u2019s beneficial to both of you, or id there\u2019s no other option for the moment. That being a bad thing is an obsolete western social construct, getting your own home is hard in this economy.\n\n\u2022 Government jobs are cool! Again, it\u2019s what you make it. Besides, the best time looking for a job is when you don\u2019t need one. If possible, try to change. If not, be happy you have a job. Honestly there\u2019s people that have flipped burgers for 26 years and they\u2019re happy to do so because it brings them money!\n\n\u2022 This seems hard, friends are important. To me it\u2019s obvious that you have a low self esteem and that maybe you should become your own friend first. Be nice to yourself, choose good options for you even tho they\u2019re hard (eating healthy, going to the gym, standing up for yourself in a good way, talking nice about yourself etc). If you do this in the right and kind way, you\u2019ll understand how to communicate with others and how to let them communicate with you. Friends are only worth it if they\u2019re good. Being shy is totally okay, but be courageous and dare to be yourself to find some nice people to spend your time with.\n\n\u2022 Go to the gym, you\u2019re a man, you\u2019re young and i assume that you\u2019re healthy enough to go. Take it easy in the gym but goooo!! Balding is okay, maybe try a beard? Go on pinterest and look for some nice photos of outfits for men and try to combine the clothes that you have like that. Everything is fixable, do something nice for yourself and fix the fixables!!!\n\n\u2022 And yes, negativity. Man, we forget how lucky we are for our life. Change or accept is the motto. You could have the best life but if you have a negative mindset the quality of your life would still be bad. You could have the worst life but if you have a positive mindset your life could still be good. I know you have it in you, just believe in yourself. You got this! Being negative is so easy, it\u2019s comforting because you have always something or someone to blame. But let it go and face yourself, meet yourself even. \n\nSorry for the tough love, i only wrote all that because i\u2019m sure that you have it in you to change for the better. Go for it! You got this!!!",

            "comment": "There is plenty of hope. After all, 26 is honestly still pretty young. To lose the weight the biggest thing is diet, but you dont need to go overboard with this. Start small with cutting out highly processed foods or high fat foods and find healthier replacements for some of the things you already eat. Start going to the gym 2-3 days a week to build some muscle and start doing some sort of low impact cardio (walking, swimming, cycling, ect.) or join a sports league (also good for meeting people) to help burn fat. Despite what people say, lifting weights does not burn many calories, so don't skip cardio.\n\nIf you want to meet new friends you can do so by joining some sort of club or other activity, like the sports clubs i mentioned earlier. Just make an effort to talk to people as much as you can manage and over time your conversation skills will improve by leaps and bounds.\n\nThe employment issues are a bit harder to address, since we dont really know why you are struggling. If it is something like poor performance or lack of effort, then the best advice for that is to try your best to improve. But my guess is that it has more to do with your negative attitude and lack of confidence. In that case, you need to work on your confidence which in my experience is best done by improving yourself the best you can, and focusing on what you have achieved instead of what you dislike about yourself. You should also look at having alternate income streams to reduce the stress of if you lose your job, and potentially even to replace your need for a normal job in the future.\n\nFor fasion you should look up what a \"capsul wardrobe\" is, but the general idea is having a small selection of clothes that all go with any other piece of clothing in your wardrobe. Wrincles are not that big a deal and i probise you that you are focusing on them way more than other people are. The same is true with balding, there are lots of haircuts that look fine with less hair, and worst case scenario, bald can be beautiful.\n\nI know that it is hard, especially looking at all the work that needs to be done to improve. I was in a similar place to you not too long ago and am still on my way to being where I feel I need to be. It will take a long time to get to were you want to be, but keep in mind, you will see improvement long before then. This isn't something where all the rewards are at the end, even if you only get 10% of the ways to your goals, you will stiff feels noticably better and that will help motivate you to keep going.\n\ntl;dr, 26 is not old. You can still improve your life in many ways and it wont take nearly as long as you think to see results.\n\nedit: Spelling",

So, you\u2019re actually doing pretty good since you\u2019re seeing areas to improve, you\u2019re not homeless and have a job. You\u2019re likely going to be around a while since 26 is still very young, so no big deal if it takes until 28 to get to the point where you\u2019re happy. You can start today.\n\nHere\u2019s what helped me: Show yourself more grace and kindness but also don\u2019t cover up reality. Use it to think of ways to improve. I had to write out my goals, wanted improvements, make a schedule, and cut some bad habits. Healthy diet and exercise goes a long way, so I started there. Mental health is a big part of it too. There\u2019s CBT and some decent apps to start with if you don\u2019t want therapy yet, and hear meditation can help, though I just started that. Cleaning up and organizing my apartment made life better, and having a few plants to take care of has been beneficial. Joining some clubs and practice socializing helps a lot too. Hell, it started with playing games like D&amp;D with some people from a local game store and then branching out from there. A buddy recommended church social events, which I guess gives a community and sense of belonging with people who are trying to be better. I struggle with this one, but nice haircuts and decent fitting clothes can go a long way too. If you do these things, which will take some time to build up as good habits anyway, it will make life better, feels good, and helps build up your confidence. That negative talk/crap won\u2019t be true and will start to fade. You\u2019ll start feeling like a better person, which makes you less focused on things that often don\u2019t matter. Need to do this, but have heard volunteering and giving back to the community is beneficial. I\u2019m planning to do Habitat for Humanity since you can socialize, give back/help people, and learn some useful skills. I\u2019m writing a wall of text here, but that\u2019s a good start.

But I'd suggest you reframe health as medicine before you look at it as a way to 'un-ugly' (and I'm not calling you that).\n\n1) I wish people would stop hating on living with family. I make really good money, live with my family, and am older than you! I take care of myself, treat them often, and keep things clean. Anyone who hates on you for that is an idiot. \n\n2) At 26 I didn't even have a job. What did it for me was the flower exercise in a book called 'What Color is Your Parachute'. Take a week and do this and just sit with it for a month or two. This paved the way for my own career (did this exercise at like 32 lol). Ultimately, the process of self-discover is what will reveal your best career expression. Diary of ones desires, past times, and natural skillsets will aid in this greatly. Journal a paragraph a day. The more self-unaware, the more of what you're experiencing you will face. \n\n3) Save up to travel. People tend to unfurl when they're around complete strangers. Trust your gut for where you'd like to go next. At 36, I'm more drawn to the people I know from abroad than those where I grew up. (Hint: it's because I evolved at the times when I traveled). \n\nIf travel isn't really your thing then I'd spruce up the social media and just mingle online. I have a nice handful of friends on social media because I'm silly lol. \n\nIf THAT's not your thing, I did go back for my degree at 28. Met loads of people at uni. Uni gyms are a great place to get fit and become a familiar face to those around campus. \n\n4) Coming from someone who used to be VERY overweight and eventually became a personal trainer, I suggest you look to tried and tested diets that are known to be effective and contain the flavor profiles that you enjoy and THEN reduce calorie intake (track them calories!). You WILL see results. \n\nInstead of just 'hitting the gym', I suggest you look take a day and look up all forms of physical activity and choose the one that looks most fun to you. (The more capacity for high intensity the better!). \n\nAs far as fashion is concerned: worry about developing a physique first and develop your stylistic sensibilities by first going with staple items first: ie. a) well-fitting pair of levi's and a white tee and chucks/vans, etc. You don't need to be a fashion model to have friends or get a girl. Like...at ALL.\n\n5) Negativity: you'd be surprised at how much negativity can be caused by inflammatory foods, lack of sunlight, and being sedentary. \n\nBe well! Thrive!",

You need to change your mindset before anything else will change.\n\nMy view might sound pessimistic but its actually empowering and helped me in tough times. It boils down to this: we live in a universe that is absolutely indifferent to all our suffering and all our joy. Life is an endless struggle against entropy. You have no special destiny, and no one is coming to save you. Things usually don\u2019t just \u201cwork out\u201d.\n\n So realize - nothing will change unless you make it change. And it will be hard. Life is hard, but you are already here. So you have two options, work hard and create a life that is meaningful to you, or always seek comfort and multiply your suffering down the road three fold. I say this because you will certainly have the thought \u201cwhy should it have to be like this, why can\u2019t I just relax and enjoy myself.\u201d Thoughts like this are as useless as lamentations that you can\u2019t fly - its not the way the universe is, so its pointless to worry about.\n\nAll the problems you mentioned are solvable - you don\u2019t have an incurable disease. So fix them. \n\nOverweight? Count calories and exercise. Food scales are like $15 and walking is free. \n\nDead-end job? Go get a degree, taking night classes if you need to. Decide on the job you want and research how other people have gotten that job- use Linkedin and see what their steps were.\n\nAlways feeling negative? Talk to your doctor about antidepressants. They can be life changing, and shouldn\u2019t be thought of as a \u201clast resort.\u201d The fact that you can get by without it does not mean you don\u2019t need it. Your mindset is a function of biology. A feeling of being worthless is common when serotonin is low (not saying this is the only biological pathway) and SSRIs can literally make you feel more content and secure in who you are. Making friends and being productive is easier when you like yourself.\n\nAll these just require making a plan and sticking to it. And you already know this - thats why my advice is more about your mindset than practical steps. You don\u2019t need someone on the internet to tell you how to google resume tips - you are hoping someone can light a fire inside you. And no one can do that for you - you have to do it.",

In hindsight,  they were absolutely right. \n\nI decided to stop going after women and work on myself. I ended up realizing that I was a POS. I treated women as objects based on their attractiveness. Some were goddesses,  others were disgusting. \n\nOnce I learned that women were just my equals,  I instantly became more attractive to them. I no longer smelled desperate, and I met my wife a while afterwards. I have moved from being an incel to being a man who women actually go after, to my wife's displeasure, in less than a year. It's all in your attitude towards yourself and towards them \ud83d\ude43",

Then, join a gym, or if that\u2019s too much to take on right now, make a point of going walking every day for an hour, take the stairs at work, or if you work from home make sure you get up from your desk every hour to walk for 10 minutes.\n\nNext, figure out what your interests are. What do you enjoy doing? Watching? Talking about? What activities make you lose track of time? Find your tribe - join a community where you\u2019ll have these things in common. Even if your passion is online gaming, many people find life-long friends in these communities. I would recommend you do something that gets you out in nature. Search Meetup for local hiking groups or communities to relate to.\n\nAll these things will help build your self esteem, self image and self confidence.\n\nJournal about your days. How activities make you feel. What your dreams and aspirations are. Writing it down helps give clarity of thought.\n\nRecommended reading: Jay Shetty - Think Like a Monk, Jeff Goins - The Art Of Work, David Deida - the way of the superior man, James Clear - Atomic Habits, James Allen - As a man thinketh, Nathaniel Brandon - The six pillars of self esteem.\n\nLastly, come off all social media that\u2019s doesn\u2019t serve you. Often Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok can be useful but in the most part they can be seriously damaging to our self-esteem and alter our dopamine receptors. Instagram and Facebook are the worst for this - remember, people only post what they want you to see, their best selves - in truth, everyone has struggles and no life is perfect.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this, don\u2019t give up.",

I really wanted to improve my social skills the summer before going to collega since I would be going all by myself. Well this challenge changed my life!!!\n\nI kept a list in my notes app, so it could keep track of how far along I was. I started out easy, saying thank you at the register in the supermarket, or the train conductor. Talking to my parents, ... I got the 20 pretty soon this way, then I got really motivated and really went out of my way to complete my list. \n\nEventually I got to the point where I would compliment a stranger on their tshirt. This was something I had NEVER imagined myself doing. I completed my challenge in less than a month and now I find it way easier to talk to people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfor making friend tho, the advice I always hear is 'go to one place regularly' you'll see the same people over and over again and people will recognise you. I for instance go to this workout class a lot and I see the same people over and over again. eventually build up the courage and talk to someone! You are both there bc of common interest so talk about that, or talk about the weather or jokingly complain about the teacher, enough options.\n\n(btw in general you'll feel much more happy if you are active, so going to a sport class might be a good solution for a few of your 'problems')",

I would start by focusing on being kind to yourself by taking care of your health first but at the same time treat others with utmost kindness and do something nice for someone everyday without any expectation that the world has to give you something back. Helping others in any shape or form will make you feel like an important individual in this world and you will truly feel like you have a purpose. People will respect you because you respect yourself and you are a generous and kind human being. The rest of what you want will come after that.",

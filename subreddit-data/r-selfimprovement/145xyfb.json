    "postText": "I get it, I just turned 24, I have time. However at the same time it feels like I don\u2019t? I didn\u2019t start college until I was around 20, community college that is. I still have a few classes I need to take before I can transfer to a university which is hopefully next year\u2026..which I\u2019m having second thoughts about. \n\nThe college has the degree I want and I\u2019d be living in the mountains which I want so badly. However, of course wanting a career in wildlife means I probably won\u2019t get a great job right away and I might not finish university until I\u2019m maybe 28, possibly 30. \n\nOn top of that, I got fired at the beginning of this year because my job started messing with my mental health so much that I did things I shouldn\u2019t have done: time theft. That however led me to getting a state job which has left me with a lot of free time during the week, I\u2019m able to pay my bills but barely. I have to utilize food pantries. It\u2019s also a job I still don\u2019t like as it\u2019s just a cleaning job within a vet hospital.\nI\u2019m able to go to therapy and hopefully will be able to go on medication. However, this job has also helped me realize that I think I want to be a vet tech which I didn\u2019t think I wanted to do at my last job. The state would pay for my schooling, however it would be two years long. If I move to the mountains for university, I would lose this opportunity. I would also lose state benefits, would probably not be able to go to therapy again for a while and who knows when I\u2019d be able to take care of myself again.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want to continue to take forever to continue my degree. I want a well paying job that leaves life feeling comfortable. I want to go to a grocery store and not worry too much about how much I\u2019m paying for groceries. \n\nAlso, on top of this. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m 100% happy in my relationship either. My partner is amazing and I\u2019m glad I have him but I\u2019ve been questioning my bisexuality for way too long and I keep suppressing it and acting like everything is fine. How do I know if the only relationship I\u2019ve been in for 4 years is the one for me? Sometimes I don\u2019t want to deal with the hardships that come with being in a relationship. Sometimes I don\u2019t want to support someone else and at the same time I do. There\u2019s a part of me that wants time alone but then I\u2019d have nobody, literally.\n\n\nGonna go insane \ud83d\ude43",

Free education, your health will continue to improve because you have access to therapy and should you choose to move to go study later, you will have more of a financial buffer and a better paying part time job around uni.\n\nIt's two years, but it may take less time to spend those two years getting your mental and financial health better than trying uni now in a place where you have limited support and potentially needing time off or repeating.",

            "comment": "Hey there - first things first, take a deep breath and think about how far you've come already. We're always expecting things to come to us quickly and easily that in the tough times we forget how much we've already fought and achieved, and you should be proud of your progress in college, therapy, and dealing with your mental health and switching jobs. Seriously, that's a lot of energy to handle so well done. Next, I'm sure it must be both terrifying and frustrating to have a plan for your life then have everything change and doubts arise - but it's so natural! Many things in life are set to challenge, push and question us, and indicate whether we're on the right path or not, but here's the thing - maybe the slow path is the best, or maybe the path you think is the best isn't even the best at all! The reality is that you never truly know, but from the sounds of it, there are some things you need to figure out before you run off to the mountains (solid move btw, also my dream).\n\nYour degree might be taking a long time, but maybe that's a good thing! I've just finished 3 years of honours psychology (I hope) and of course, at the end I was so ready for all the stress to be over, but now it's done and I may never be in education again, or not for a good while at least, and in some ways that's nice, but in others I'm saying goodbye to a whole period of my life and having to move on to something else. My point is, are you just trying to get this part of your life over with and move onto the next? I don't recommend it, that's where the overwhelmed and lost feeling stems from. Sometimes trying to be a bit more present and connected to the moment can make all the difference, and give you that gratitude to appreciate where you are now. Considering your feelings about your relationship, mental health and university options, I'd honestly just tell you to slow down a bit! There's clearly a lot on your mind right now, and you don't want to rush into a decision when you haven't been thinking clearly enough, I'd even think about having a year off from school so you can hopefully get some more experience surrounding animal care so you can get a sure idea of what you want to do next. You don't want to choose something then 6 months later realise you'd prefer something else but never tried it out. This is all just advice of course, at the end of the day you make the decisions, but I urge you to really commit some time to weighing up your options first!\n\nAbout your relationship, well it's not an easy topic. I'd love to say that I've known people who have realised their sexuality but still stayed with the same partner and been happy, but I really don't know anyone from firsthand experience. Wanting to explore your sexuality is a completely valid reason for a breakup and it certainly doesn't make you look like a bad person, you just have to be honest and say you're not ready for a complete commitment right now because there are other things you need to experience first. If he's understanding he'll get it with no hard feelings - some couples I know that have broken up for this reason have remained great friends afterwards, or hell, if it's something you're both comfortable with you can stay together but talk about opening the relationship in some way. It's a very scary situation I'm sure, especially after knowing him for so long, but at this point I hope he wants what is truly best for you, regardless of how it affects him. \n\nOnce again, you've been going through a lot and even your decision to speak about it on here shows your dedication to figuring out what's best for you, and that's really admirable. Just remember that life has to be uncomfortable sometimes, and painful, but it shouldn't be all the time. Make sure you're giving yourself rest and time off to live in the moment doing what makes you happy. Your days will get brighter eventually, I know it. I hope this helps in some way and my DMs are always open if you need someone to talk to :)",

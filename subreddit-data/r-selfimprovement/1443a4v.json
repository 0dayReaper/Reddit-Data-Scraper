Have a try and give me your feedback \nThanks for reading",

And remember, if we make the clothes everything who are we without them. \n\nThere are so many stories about this, particularly Batman, where he realizes the cowl was his way to articulate who he actually was and when he doesn\u2019t have it he can still be that hero. \n\nIn many ways this view is the exact opposite of what you\u2019re implying it is. It can help us self express only in a specific context (which was because we gave that meaning to the clothes), you can\u2019t make other people see you how you want them too (else you wouldn\u2019t need a new attire), you\u2019re putting on these clothes to take a new role not removing them. \n\nThis could be a way to get someone to come to recognize the worth of their qualities instead of their appearance and how their seen but it seems the reason someone would do this is to feed their already unhealthy desire to be liked.",

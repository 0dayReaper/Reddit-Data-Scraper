            "comment": "I found it excellent for *being* a friend, but not so much for people being a friend to *me.* It makes a lot of assumptions. I think it was excellent for its time, but I find it outdated. Maybe it's confirmation bias, but I find the methods to be mostly successful with older people and folks with fewer worries. \n\nIt's still worth a read, and the advice \"become genuinely interested in other people\" is timeless. It's also meta. If I am to meet people where they're at, can't always rely on a book. I have to get to know them in a way that is as non-judgmental as possible/safe.\n\nSome of my not-so-fluffy favorites:\n\nCrucial Accountability by Kerry Patterson et al. \n\nIn Business As In Life, You Don't Get What You Deserve, You Get What You Negotiate by Chester Karrass \n\nPulling Your Own Strings by Wayne Dyer \n\nDialectical behavior therapy is awesome for everyone, regardless of whether they have a mental illness. \n\nThese are also older titles, but I find that they're even more applicable. Times are scary, and it feels like there is more and more bad actors. I NEEDED TO SET BOUNDARIES so that I could even BEGIN to act in good faith. \n\nOtherwise, the best advice I've ever received is to take one thing, get good at it, enjoy it, and make it your own. Give people easy ways to connect with you. \n\nThis leads me to How to Start Conversations and Make Friends by Don Gabor. It's also older, but it starts from the simplest of concepts. I don't personally subscribe to the dating part of it. Just treat your preferred gender like people, and that's that. \n\nI need to start watching more YouTube videos on the subject. Because reading is one thing, but I find it helpful to see people model their advice. I find that things sound wayyy different in my head, so some self-recording is also helpful (but can be triggering and demoralizing at first.. KEEP GOING!!)\n\nEdit: how could I forget? The Relationship Cure by John Gottman &amp; Joan DeClaire\n\nAwkward title, awkward cover, excellent advice. If you look at people's actions and words as bids for connection, you start seeing them everywhere, and then take your pick. That's why the books on boundaries are so important to me",

I don\u2019t think that counts as being manipulative.

You might just feel a little uncomfortable because people are bringing a lot of energy towards you an you don\u2019t know how to properly match it or respond so in return you feel a little weirded out or anxious an it makes for awkward exchanges, especially with strangers.",

I think the reason I\u2019ve been doing it is due to resentment and irritability toward something else and I take it out on peoples behavior that don\u2019t align with how I personally would handle things. So for me, addressing whatever is causing that resentment can help build more understanding and open mindedness for how other people behave and interact differently than I do.",

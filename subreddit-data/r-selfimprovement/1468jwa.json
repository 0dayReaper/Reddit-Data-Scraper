Certainly, the aesthetic value of weight loss was great but not carrying around the extra mass had added value. My back once ached constantly and my sciatic nerves would cause shooting pain in my legs. I was tired and had afternoon crashes. I got tired after a few pullups and forget running long distances. \n\nNow, I am happy with my body. I don't ache. I can run for miles and my children don't ask me why I have a \"fat tummy\" anymore.",

They were telling lies about me, they put me down constantly, they had something against my weightlifting-hobby, my new way of eating, my everything. They spread lies about me and spoke about me constantly without me being there. All of this since I started to improve myself and I changed, my mindset changed, my habits changed, and I and they were getting very different. So they hated me.\n\nBut I just went on. I went on without friends and naturally, without searching, I found new friends through my self-improvement, through my hobbies.\n\nYou\u2019ll find true friends, who are just like you, if you just go on being yourself.",

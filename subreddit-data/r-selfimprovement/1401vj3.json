    "postText": "I really struggle with self-confidence/ social anxiety and panic attacks. It definitely got worse during the pandemic and seems to have intensified. I see a therapist weekly, but this constant anxiety and self doubt are always there under the surface. \n\nI\u2019ve had a really stressful couple of years, mostly around work and the general financial concerns other millennials find themselves in, and now I\u2019m in a clinical depression. \n\nAny tips out there for how not to negative self-talk? Every interaction I have leaves me playing it over and over in my mind that everyone hates me or I messed up and leaves a general spiral. And not only is this not healthy, it feels selfish too. \n\nLooking for approaches maybe I haven\u2019t tried \ud83d\ude2c",

            "comment": "My method for quieting the negative self talk is just reminding myself that my brain is a liar.\n\nYour brain processes multiple thousands of thoughts every day. Many of them are bound to be wrong. \n\nI think things that aren't true all the time. Sometimes I meet another person and I think they're a certain way when they aren't. Sometimes I do a math problem and I get the wrong answer with full confidence. Sometimes I answer trivia questions and get them incorrect. My brain doesn't know the truth. My brain only knows what it thinks. Think of how many times you've listened to other people spout \"knowledge\" that they TRULY BELIEVE they possess, and it sounds completely ridiculous to you. Just because someone thinks something, does not make it true.\n\nSo why should I ever believe my brain when it says that everyone hates me? When it says that I'm a terrible person or that I'm not deserving of love? Who gave my brain the authority to decide that when it's been wrong about so many other things? \n\nI treat that negative voice in my head as a crazy conspiracy theorist spouting ridiculous refrains at every turn. \"Nobody wants you around!\" Okay, brain. \"You ruin everything!\" Whatever you say.\n\nThe thoughts don't go away, but they're definitely a lot easier to dismiss when you decide not to believe everything you think.",

    "postText": "**Distinguishing the key differences between Nice Guys and genuinely good men.**\n\nIn this world, there is a subset of men that believe women are only attracted to assholes.\n\nWhich is true, if you preface this belief with 'very few'.\n\nThe vast majority of women are attracted to good men.\n\nThe subset of men that believe otherwise are Nice Guys.\n\n## What's a Nice Guy?\n\n## Nice Guy: (noun)\n\nA man that displays overwhelming acts of kindness towards women, with a firm expectation of immediate romantic or sexual rewards.\n\nSome of the common traits of a Nice Guy include:\n\n## He puts women on a pedestal\n\nNice guys are prone to putting women on a pedestal. They do so to the point of making a woman uncomfortable, or worse, bored.\n\nThey will 'coincidentally' have all of the same hobbies and interests as her.\n\nThey will agree with all of her world views and personal opinions.\n\nThey refuse to say anything that could offend her (up until the point she rejects him, but we'll get to that in a moment).\n\nThey are at her beck and call whether or not she becks or calls for it.\u00a0\n\nThey constantly fawn over her.\n\nThey laugh too loudly at her throwaway jokes.\n\nThey drown her in unnecessary flattery.\n\n## He's dishonest\n\nNice Guy's are dishonest by nature.\n\nThey pretend to agree with everything a woman says.\n\nThey deceive women through the use of emotional manipulation.\n\nThey falsely big-note themselves to women.\n\nThey literally tell women: 'I'm a good guy'.\n\nNice Guys are dishonest.\n\n## Being a sore loser\n\nWhen a nice guy faces rejection from a woman, his response generally involves a two-step approach:\n\n## 1.\u00a0He initially ignores it.\n\nA Nice Guy will relentlessly continue his pursuit of a woman, despite any subtle, initial signals she gives off that she's not interested.\n\nAs such, women are eventually pushed to the point of forcefully spelling it out to him: 'I'M NOT INTERESTED, LEAVE ME ALONE'.\n\n## 2. He throws a tantrum\n\nOnce a Nice Guy realises defeat, he doesn't keep his cool and move on from the rejection with grace and civility.\n\nHe burns the bridge between him and her until there is nothing left but the charred remains of his bruised ego.\n\nHe calls her a prude or a slut (or sometimes both, unaware of the irony).\n\nHe makes nasty comments about her personal appearance.\n\nFinally,then he caps it off with something along the lines of: 'I'm out of your league anyway.'\n\nHere is an example of how this could play out in an online dating scenario:\n\nNice Guy: Hello Emily, you have beautiful eyes.I should tell you, I'm not like most guys.I know how to treat a girl right.\u00a0If you go out with me, I'll be the one in the kitchen making YOU a sandwich!\u00a0Hehe...\n\n**Emily: Hey, thanks for the compliment.**\n\n**Nice Guy: You're welcome.So, what sort of sandwich can I come over and make for you tonight?**\n\n**\\*15 minutes pass\\***\n\n**Nice Guy: Hello?**\n\n**Emily: Hey, sorry, I'm at work.I appreciate the offer, but I just got out of a relationship, and I'm not really ready to meet up with any guys just yet.** **Nice Guy: Well that's good, cos I'm not just any guy. Hehe.How about we take it slow then. Let me take you out for a coffee.**\n\n**Emily: As I said, I'm not ready for that yet.**\n\n**Nice Guy: Come on, I promise I'm a good guy.**\n\n**Emily: Look, I'm not interested, ok? Sorry.**\n\n**Nice Guy: Ok, fine. Jeez. Just trying to be nice.**\n\n**\\*15 minutes pass\\***\n\n**Nice Guy: I bet you'll end up dating some jobless loser who treats you like shit.**\u00a0\n\n**\\*1 hour passes\\***\n\nNice Guy: **No wonder your last boyfriend left you.Women only date asshole losers.\u00a0If you don't want to meet any guys, then why the fuck are you on this app in the first place?**\n\n**\\*1 hour passes\\***\n\n**Nice Guy: Fine, don't respond. Slut.**\n\nThis sort of interaction begs the question: If women are only attracted to assholes, why aren't they swooning over Nice Guys? Because they mostly don't.\n\n## He has no respect for women\n\nDeep down, Nice Guys have no respect for women.\u00a0\n\nThis is apparent when you witness the Jekyll to Hyde transformation a Nice Guy makes whenever a woman rejects him.\n\nIt is also apparent with the overwhelming approach Nice Guys take to their pursuit of a woman.\n\nMen who respect women don't check in on them every ten minutes, nor do they leave women banks of 4 unresponded text messages on the regular.\u00a0\n\nThis sort of behaviour is invasive, uncomfortable and ultimately, disrespectful.\n\n## He's completely unaware of himself\n\nNice Guys seldom accept fault when a woman rejects them.\n\nThey refuse to consider: 'If I keep sending women uncomfortably flattering messages and not a single one of them responds positively, maybe that's on me?'\n\nInstead, a Nice Guy carries on recycling the same tired, empty messages, growing more resentful with each rejection he receives in response.\n\nA Nice Guy's inability to self-reflect and self-improve condemns him to a life of bitter cynicism and exponentially painful rejection.\n\n## Are Nice Guys born Nice Guys, or do they become them?\n\nNow that you've read through some of the typical traits of a Nice Guy, you're probably wondering: 'are Nice Guys born Nice Guys, or do they become them?'\n\nWhile many Nice Guys have always been selfish, cynical pricks, not all of them were born this way. Some are newly Nice Guys.\n\n## What's a newly Nice Guy?\n\nNewly Nice Guys are those that began their dating life as insecure, misguided young men and devolved into Nice Guys over time.\n\nLet me show you an example of how this happens.\n\nIn this example, I'll call our pre-Nice Guy, Guy.\n\n***Guy starts speaking to a woman.***\n\n***He is overwhelmingly flattering in his approach.***\n\n***The woman feels uncomfortable, and eventually, Guy gets rejected.***\n\n***Guy is heartbroken by the rejection and confused as to why she rejected him. After all, he was so kind and friendly towards her.***\n\n***Eventually, he gets over the rejection and moves on in search of another.***\n\n***Guy starts speaking to a new woman.***\n\n***Just like last time, he is overwhelmingly flattering in his approach.***\n\n***The woman feels uncomfortable, and eventually, Guy gets rejected.***\n\n***Guy is heartbroken by the rejection and even more confused as to why it happened. After all, he was so kind and friendly towards her.***\n\n***Eventually, he gets over the rejection and moves on in search of another.***\n\nAs this pattern continues, Guy becomes a little more cynical and a little more frustrated each time.\n\nEver heard of the saying: The definition of madness is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result?\n\nWell, that's spot on in the case of how some men become newly Nice Guys, and how Nice Guys stay Nice Guys.\n\nThey continue the same lazy, ill-conceived attempts at seduction over and over, expecting someone will eventually take the bait.\n\nAs the rejections pile up, they develop a resentment towards women, become sore-losers and convince themselves into believing that the only reason women don't like them, is because women are only attracted to assholes.\n\n## Let's talk about good men\n\nNice Guys and good men are polar opposites.\n\nWhile a Nice Guy is disrespectful, insincere, overly agreeable and selfish, a good man is respectful, confident, honest and selfless.\n\nSome of the common traits of a good man include:\n\n## He carries out acts of kindness with no ulterior motive\n\nGood men don't hold the door open for women or compliment their smiles, as a way to get her into bed.\n\nA good man displays acts of kindness towards women because being kind and respectful is in his nature.\n\nWomen appreciate acts of kindness when they sense that it's being delivered in a sincere, ulterior free manner.\n\nSincere gestures from a man lower a woman's defences and increase his credibility in her eyes.\n\n## He treats women as individuals\n\nUnlike Nice Guys, (who let their negative experiences with a few women dictate their views on all women) a good man treats women on a case by case basis.\n\nThis is beneficial, regardless of the outcome of his past encounters with women.\n\nWhen a past encounter was negative, he doesn't project his baggage onto the next woman.\n\nWhen a past encounter was positive, he doesn't set unrealistically high expectations upon the next woman.\n\n## He's a good loser\n\nWhen a good man gets rejected by a girl, (yes, it does happen) no matter how painful it feels, he knows when to call it quits, accept the loss and move on.\n\nHe won't respond to her rejection message demanding she explains herself further.\n\nHe won't accuse her of disliking him because he treated her too well.\n\nHe won't send her insulting messages until she elicits an emotional response.\n\nHe's too busy getting back on his feet and finding somebody else.\n\n***Disclaimer:*** *The recovery time from a break-up is dependent on the length and nature of the relationship. I'm not suggesting good men move on from every rejection quickly and effortlessly.*\n\n## He doesn't dote on women\n\nGood men are rarely accused of appearing desperate in their pursuit of a woman.\u00a0 This is namely because a good man won't dote on a woman.\n\nBefore he compliments her, he senses that the situation calls for it.\n\nHe won't show strong affection towards a woman until he feels the relationship has developed to the point where his affection will be well received and reciprocated.\n\nHe doesn't treat women like poor, lost puppies, as he sees them as adults who are capable of looking after themselves.\n\n## He is always looking for ways to improve\n\nGood men are naturally self-reflective beings.\n\nWhen a good man realises his shortcomings or is faced with rejection, he makes a concerted effort to confront his shortcomings and improve himself.\n\nThis is vastly different from Nice Guys, who prefer to blame their problems on everyone else.\n\n## He challenges women\n\nGood men won't enthusiastically agree with everything a woman says and does. If he disagrees with something she's said, he will make it known, respectfully.\n\nGood men also aren't afraid to make fun of a woman (in a fun and playful way).\u00a0\n\nExamples of this include: 'I'd ask you to dance, but you couldn't handle my moves' or 'I don't think you and I are going to work out, we should call it quits now' (after she reveals she doesn't like Nando's)\n\n## He is self-assured\n\nGood men know their worth and remind themselves of it often.\n\nThey won't bend at the will of others or let 'haters' alter the views they have of themselves.\n\nThey hold strong to their values and express them with women in a mature are rational manner.\n\n## He respects women\n\nGood men view women as their peers.\n\nBy treating women as their peers (which, in fairness, all men rightfully should), good men reap 2 benefits:\n\n1. They don't run the risk of becoming subservient to a woman.\n2. They don't view women as inferior by expecting immediate gratification for their attempts at seduction (therefore their expectations aren't constantly crushed, leading them down a hateful emotional spiral ala Nice Guys.)\n\n## He owns his insecurities\n\nBeing a good man doesn't mean being free from insecurities.\n\nSure, the average good man has far fewer insecurities than the average Nice Guy, but still - he does have them.\n\nThe difference is, he's not afraid to admit them.\n\nWhere a Nice Guy will channel his insecurities into bullying others and bringing them down, a good man owns his insecurities and looks to address them in a healthy manner.\n\nThe way a good man owns his insecurities is by:\n\n\\- Being open about them and seeking counsel from friends on them\n\n\\- Considering ways he can alleviate his insecurities by improving himself\n\n\\- Developing strong empathy and understanding for the insecurities of others, based on those he sees in himself\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nWhile the traits listed above provide an underlying framework of what makes a Nice Guy vs. what makes a good man, the world is not so black and white.\n\nSome good guys have moments of weakness, just as some Nice Guys have moments of clarity and good.\n\nIf you are guilty of a few Nice Guy traits and you fear you could become a full blown Nice Guy, please know - there's still a chance for salvation.\n\nMy advice to you is to change your mindset and attitude towards women, but firstly - towards yourself.\n\nIf you don't,\u00a0 you are likely to live a life filled with romantic rejection and increasing bitterness towards yourself and others.\n\nNice Guys, start being good men.\n\nGood men, keep up the good work.",

It's an unpleasant truth but no one gets through life without causing someone pain (including yourself), whether deliberate or not. Process the shame, don't let it continue to eat you up inside. Mourn it, grieve it, whatever you need to do to let off some of the intensity. You could pursue growth as a way to distance yourself from shame.. and you can also grow because you are practicing advocating for yourself, because you are building love for yourself, because you know you want to (and deserve to be) in a headspace where you are so solidly grounded and self-aware that your interactions with the world and other people comes from genuine love, compassion, kindness and not out of entitlement and a need to fill an emptiness.",

Even after the main guy throws a tantrum, she could\u2019ve stopped talking to him and distanced herself from him right then and there, yet she goes back to him and continues to give him romantic signals. Yes, she makes it clear she doesn\u2019t want a relationship, yet she continues to indulge the protagonist\u2019s advances. Of course the protagonist is to blame as well, perhaps more so since his feelings/actions are in his control, but I don\u2019t think zoey\u2019s character is without blame either.\n\nI mean, if you look at all of her actions, it\u2019s clear that she doesn\u2019t give any thought toward the long term - everything from the way she interacts with the protagonist to the way she gets married on a whim at the end. She is an airhead who could\u2019ve stopped the situation from getting worse and definitely lead the protagonist on. His actions were far from perfect, but so were hers.",

It was clear he was seeing her as more than just a casual relationship and in return did she stop seeing him? Nope. She just kept being around him. \n\nHonestly, after leading him on like that, ghosting him, and then seeing her settling down with another man must have been a huge gut punch. I side with him because he never got offered an explanation as to why he wasn't good enough. \n\nI'm not saying that he isn't to blame as well (maybe stop begging her and just leave dude) but that sort of treatment is cruel. Honestly, having watched that movie and seeing everyone support the girl just makes me sick and wonder if people realize how horrified and traumatized the guy must be. \n\nI've seen the same thing happen in multiple real-life relationships as well where the current meta is to cut them off completely, and move on whilst rationalizing to themselves that it's for the best. No, it is not. That stuff is traumatizing to the other party and can derail their own self-worth. People deserve to be let down face-to-face.",

When Summer opens up to him, he just thinks about himself and never really listens.\n\nThis is very important, as I've had a guy who said he was in love with me and we became close friends, sometimes more but he always expected something more and just had this idea of me that wasn't me at all. He was very nice and I tried, but you can't really feel loved by guys like that, you can never feel seen by them. And the fact that they think they \"deserve\" your love and time just because they love you a lot and do nice things to you is such a huge pressure on someone. He should've been clear about what he wants \"I either want you as a girlfriend or I won't touch you\" etc. Like Dan did with Blair in Gossip Girl, that actually got him the girl. Or try to get to know her first before falling in love just because she likes the same couple of things as him (which is more about him and his ideals than who she really is) He didn't really love Summer because he never knew who she really is, never listened. And we never got to see the guy Summer married at the end, but I'm pretty sure he wasn't like Tom.\n\nHe believes meeting \"the one\" is the only way he can be happy and projects that onto Summer. But love is not about constantly being happy, it's not about what is good about the other person. It's about knowing everything horrible about them, their fears and traumas and wanting to be with them anyways. He even days \"I love how she makes me feel.\" Women can feel this, he doesn't love her he loves how he feels with her. It's all about himself. \n\nWhen she opens up to him and days \"I've never told anyone this before.\" his reaction is \"I guess I'm not just anybody.\" I mean, seriously? She opens up to him and all be can think about is still himself? I'm sorry but most women would not want to be with Tom. Even the screenwriter says \"He doesn't know anything about her. He just sees what he wants to see.\"\n\nI mean, when she says she doesn't want a boyfriend he just screams \"I say we're a couple, god damn it\" he feels like he deserves to be her boyfriend just because he took a punch that she didn't even ask for. Just accept she doesn't want a boyfriend and move on. He didn't have self confidence or self worth to begin with, it's not Summers fault if he has less after she leaves. It's not someone else's responsibility to make you respect yourself more.",

No one is perfect, and just like anything else, dating has a learning curve. Often times we see failure as something to be ashamed of but that simply shouldn\u2019t be the case. Failure is proof you tried, and more importantly, it shows that your eventual success is due to your ability to learn and grow. I think that\u2019s why people associate \u201cbad boys\u201d with getting girls. Because \u201cbad boys\u201d are normally far more confident in themselves and don\u2019t need gratification from another person. Being confident in yourself while also being able to show humility and grace is something that\u2019s much easier said then done.",

Ever heard someone say to a girl, \"if a boy pulls on your pigtails or is mean to you, it means he likes you\"? This is where that \"bad boy\" attraction ultimately comes from. If he's showing what are basically red flags even at a young age he's seen as more attractive. I should know, I had a crush on a \"bad boy\" in my teens simply for that reason and I know I'm not alone. That being said, it's not young boys' fault as society is telling them that the only way to show they \"like like\" someone is to be mean to them. But yes, you're right, generally people grow out of it as they mature and realise that isn't how the real world works. We just need to work on changing those deep rooted societal values too so that more men and women can have healthier relationships in the future.",

I also see those types of nice guys all the time at my family's pub, putting one friend who I got a job there bartending on a pedestal and simping like crazy over her. I mean yeah shes my friend but I didnt do a brake job on her truck for free, but I didnt charge her very much either, it was easy and was just happy to help save her some cash.   One night I was in there last week or so and this dude brings her dinner and she tried to pay him and he refused and said \"anything for you, you're my queen\". \n\nAll in all thanks for this OP, you actually made me feel a lot better than I have been lately. I recently got my heart broke and was thinkin I didnt handle it with her very well, when in actuality I did pretty close to what you say a good man should do. Maybe thats why she still talks to me like a human being now thats its been a few months and straight up said she I am a good man. \n\nSo thank you again for writing this, its definitely been a boost of confidence for the self improvement I have been doing the last couple years and gives me more confidence in my Life Coaches as well. \n\nHave a wonderful week OP.",

Now that term refers to manipulative, borderline toxic losers that abuse women when they reject them. Why couldn't we just call them what they are?",

If you've gotten to know their interests a little, you can play on that a bit. \n\nExample: I'm a big car guy, and I recently learned that an older friend liked a certain brand. Maserati, for those wondering. They're prone to issues, though. I was able to follow up later by showing her a posting of one of the models we both liked for only $8k($120k new in 2008). I just joked with her and said \"It's tempting, right? Don't do it though!\"\n\nI like otters, and she said that she didn't. That's okay! But she's going to get a text gif of an otter doing something cute someday.",

Everyone has baggage, and while no one is obligated to put up with it, real friends will help you unpack. But both parties have to be willing to work on each other and themselves.\n\nSo if you don't line up with the Good Man you want to be, keep working on it, and don't give up, and don't give up on finding the right person while you're on that journey. If you're both lucky, it'll be a lifelong journey of loving, cooperative self improvement.",

I've definitely been called a nice guy plenty of times in the past and I can now see how I might have projected some of the things you brought up.  Women tend to use it when they have nothing else nice to say about someone.  \n\nI like to think I eventually evolved into a good man though.  I'm far from perfect but I do try to improve yet I still accept my shortcomings.  I can't recall if anyone's ever called me a good man to my face, but I still know I am.

And this post gave me and a whole bunch of other dudes a new clarity on this subject, so thank you for putting in your time and effort into making this post. Really appreciate it!!!\n\nAnd oh boy oh boy, do I gotta share this with a bunch of my nice guy friends. Like I\u2019m talking about full on nice guy types.

I\u2019m not a dating expert at all, like far from it. Only dated 2 girls, and have been single for the last 2 years. Idk why he comes to me for advice lol, anyways getting off topic.

            "comment": "Nice and informative post. I \\[21/M\\] feel like i'm in a painful transition phase at the moment, I can confidently say that I have those good qualities, however I get frustrated that I barely get dates even though I want to be a in a long term relationship. I'm also frustrated that if I don't proactively pursue a girl, i will get nowhere and nothing will happen, whereas if I'm more active about it I will most likely face many more rejections (which is quite demoralizing as I've done and tried it before), that's being needy which the post goes against and will most likely get nowhere. I'd like to add that I'm not unattractive, I get a lot of gazes from women/girls but it hasn't amounted to anything. E.g) I was on a popular street in my city yesterday that has a lot of pubs/bars and got lots of heads turning, but that positive attention and ego trip conflicts with me because I don't know what the fuck to do? I recently dyed the top half of my hair half blonde to add a flair to my look which has helped. Ironically I have confidence, calm and can be a guy in charge in life threatening situations or when shit gets real as I've dealt with a lot of those growing up (abusive parents, running away from home twice at 17 and 19). I think my childhood and teenage years have shaped most of my maturity, which is a good thing, but at the cost of being a toxic overthinker and not being abel to relate to things with friends my age; hence i get along better with people that are a couple of years older than me.\n\nI know that women owe me nothing, and vice versa, but ashamedly at the back of my head it's still bitter that they get to pick and choose (and no I'm not talking about casual sex) while I go through constant heavy phases of loneliness, even after having a good day or a good time with friends. Ironically most of my friends are girls who have said I'm attractive but not their type (which is fine), I have guy friends as well, I take care of myself, dress well, gym, hobbies  and 2 jobs. Logically, I know that all of those things don't entitle me to dates or a relationship, but emotionally it can get pretty lonely because I have so ***many chips on my shoulders that need time to be broken down (having shit parents that I had to cut everything off from, so no positive biological family relationships make it worse as I'm healing from all that shit and there being no safety net, I've also had to cut off a toxic previous girlfriend recently where we were on and off for a few years, so i'm not inexperienced in a relationship/sexual context).*** Back to dating however, I'm working on framing my \"problems\" as something that I'm inexperienced in, so failure is inevitably part of the process, learned that one from Dr. K on youtube.\n\nThe best things I know to do is to shut the fuck up, stop overthinking and take a risk if a situation arises, get out of my comfort zone as much as possible when it comes to girls (but not to the point of ironically being needy), continue with therapy and the gym :')\n\nEdit: My coping mechanisms are currently just cycling through hip hop/rap songs (travis scott plug) especially at the gym that keep me in a good bumpy mood, trying to go the gym everyday, trying to find time to get back into gaming with my online friends too should also do me good.",

I think my argument applies in situations where two people are forced to spend time together, but it mainly applies in situations where a friendship develops first. In some cases, men hide their attraction to women and act like they want to be friends until one day they suddenly reveal their interest and end the friendship if their feelings aren\u2019t reciprocated. I imagine there are women who do this too. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to forge a friendship if you\u2019re secretly trying to merge it into a relationship. To your point though, if there was no illusion of friendship before expressing interest, there\u2019s certainly no obligation to keep putting effort in afterward.",

You define your level of comfortability and if that is where you are, then that's fine! I want only to offer a perspective that may or may not be helpful.\n\nI think there's a key difference between a good guy and a nice guy here. \n\nA good guy will respect your decision, and maintain a healthy relationship that avoids a few key things:\n\n1) Dwelling on those feelings. It is definitely possible to move on, sometimes it takes time or a shift in perspective.\n\n2) Reminding you of their past feelings.\n\n3) Harboring and outwardly displaying any misgivings they may have felt upon initial rejection.\n\nIf they aren't capable of these things, absolutely break contact. I don't know how old you are, but generally (at least in my experience) as men age they can  develop an \"off-switch\" towards  emotions.",

I only liked him as a friend and was clear about it. He handled it brilliantly, still wanted to be friends and was respectful about it but I could still sense his longing for me (I'm a pretty empathetic person that can read subtle social cues well) and it honestly was really sad. I didn't like how it hung over me and I started to feel guilty about it, and pity towards him. \n\nUltimately, I do think had I remained friends with him he would have eagerly taken any opportunity to be with me, and that rubbed me the wrong way. I felt too responsible for his feelings (and yes this is partly pressure I was putting in my own self, but it's just the kind of person I am).\n\nAlso because I am now in a relationship, I don't find it appropriate to maintain a friendship with someone who had feelings for me. But that's a whole different subject.",

But I guess if they want their nice guy title so badly I can get on board with calling them that under your definition.  Also nice to read this and just refocus on trying to be a good man rather than a nice guy.  Great post!",

Over time, I started to grow up, to mature both emotionally and intellectually. She did not, and now I realize that this girl who was once my world really only remained in that place for my own self validation.\n\nReading this feels to me like a signal from God, the universe, or some other almighty power that I\u2019m gonna be okay, and I will have no trouble finding the right person, because I can honestly say that, while I was off to a rough start years ago, all these things a good man needs to be I already have grown into being.\n\n...Or it could just be confirmation bias. I\u2019ll just chock one up for the home team and walk away with a victory.",

I still have trouble making a comment that could be considered \u201crude\u201d or \u201cinsulting\u201d but meaning that in a joking way and I still do nice things like hold the door open whenever I can.

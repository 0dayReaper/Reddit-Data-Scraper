    "postText": "I (21f) just bought my first car, a beater 2000 Toyota Corolla for $1500 paid off. In this economy I thought it was a great deal! It has some dents and paint is fading but I plan on getting it fixed &amp; painted. It runs great, and I finally got a car without having any help from my family. \n\nBut now, my family keeps making jokes about my car. We live in the suburbs so they keep laughing saying it\u2019s an eye sore, &amp; asking can I park different to hide the dent. However, this is the same family that has $700 car notes, &amp; gets cars for \u201clooks\u201d to keep up with \u201cJoneses\u201d when we barely can afford it. \n\nMy goal is to keep the car I just bought &amp; gradually save to pay off my credit cards.\nSo by the time I upgrade, my credit score is better, and I\u2019ll be able to get something better. Should I stick to my plan and ignore the naysayers?",

Here's the thing: your family isn't paying your bills, so it's none of their business how you spend. \n\nA car's a car's a car, just because you have a crappy one now doesn't mean you'll forever be there. Handle your business, get yourself investing, and before you know it you'll be able to buy any car you want.\n\nBonus hint: my investments would pay for any car I want if I wanted to do it. Instead I'm letting those investments compound so I can buy more investments.",

From the other end of this comes regret.  \n18 years ago, I purchased $22,000 BMW because I happened to have had the cash at the time. What I should have done is invested that money in a S&amp;P500 fund or something that returned well. Today I could have had $110,000 instead of that old depreciated car.  Use an investment calculator to see what might have been with compounding returns.  We never were taught investing in school.\n\nChoose wisely.",

When something breaks you'll hopefully have the funds to get it fixed, no questions asked. Sometimes it's annoying to have to get some things fixed, but once they're replaced you know they'll be fine for a good long while.

Hold your head high that in an age of debt, you got something you can call *your own*, without owing anyone anything for it. Remember to \"treat her right and she'll always bring you home\" (and save you alot in the process). Rooting for you (and your Corolla!)",

Might be fine until they retire and have to continue working to keep up with the bills or pass on the debt, go bankrupt etc. Interest will keep them paying more than they initially even spent. You, are the smart one here.\n\nI will say that I have family who has made millions. Paid off their cars and their favourite car is a toyota camry from 2009. It drives better than the Mercedes they had apparently! They have always said that cars are poor investments that depreciate and cost $$$ to get fixed. Better to get a nice driving car than an expensive one that is both frustrating and expensive to fix if something gets broken. They also don\u2019t go on many trips either. They are very savy about their investments and spending.\n\nConversely, I also have family that wants to keep up with the Joneses and are in debt. They have a big house, designer clothes, expensive shiny vehicles, go on trips all the time etc. The kicker is that they do make good money, they just spend it like crazy and unwisely. They are massively jealous of my other family members success and ability to pay things off without debt.",

I was financially in a position where all I wanted to do was cut costs, pay off debts and save. Why? I wanted to restart and wanted to reposition myself to go after goals. These new goals weren\u2019t achievable if I had a nice new car and new toy. Yeah in life it\u2019s great to compete, why do we buy luxury cars?? We want to compete, we want to show people we are successful or doing well. That\u2019s natural\u2026what\u2019s not natural is expecting everyone else to be on your level or plane.\n\nThe truth is friend, the people laughing at you\u2026they in their minds worked very hard and that nice car to them represent their journey. Some people are more selfish than others\u2026they forget their journey. Those are the people that laugh at you. Knowing that they shouldn\u2019t matter.\n\nWhat you should know is, people in your position do eventually drive nice cars. Actually in my experience the people who do what you are doing end up driving the nicest cars eventually.\n\nJust know this, when you\u2019re driving down that road in that car you purchased to save some bucks. There is a guy like me, driving by you, possibly in a very nice car. We know exactly what you\u2019re doing and where you come from. We\u2019re not laughing, we\u2019re actually driving by saying God Speed friend. I hope know you\u2019ll make it, this is such a pro move.\n\nNever change.\n\nAnyone laughing at you for making smart choices is a moron. Don\u2019t fight time, just keep making smart choices. They won\u2019t be laughing a decade from now.\n\nPS while you\u2019re at it, research IRA accounts and start saving for your retirement (even a dollar a day.) You should go learn about saving for retirement. A few things at your age worth learning is IRA accounts, 401k\u2019s and compound interest. \n\nGo get a realestate agents license, you\u2019ll learn about the housing market and equities easy. Should be 40-75 hours of class depending on your state. Definitely do that and buy a house with a first time home buyers mortgage by 25. At that point you\u2019ll have learned a bunch.\n\nYou are too young for credit card debit, get one card and lower your limit. Your credit card should only be used when you have that amount in cash in another account. Credit cards are for building credit at your age. Slow down on that.\n\nYou could be a millionaire in less than two decades. Just keep making smart choices and correct the credit card thing.\n\nIf you follow my words, I promise you that this whole experience will come around full circle in time. Life is a trip, never stop learning.",

Let them make their jokes and be smug. It sucks it's your family, they should be more supportive, they should see your example and want to make smarter financial decisions themselves. Hopefully over time they'll see it working and may want to follow suit.\n\nI'm almost 40, make plenty of money, walk everywhere, buy clothes at Goodwill, never eat out, save as much money as possible. And I think some people think I'm poor lol, I'm definitely not *rich* but I have no money-related stress, I want for nothing, and I'm debt free. My family is very proud and supportive though. It's a bummer yours wants to poke fun. Hopefully they come around when they see you're making progress towards financial independence and security. Keep up the good work!",

I put in some good audio system and now I\u2019m happy with it. You are doing the right choice by getting cheap car, u can get yourself something fancy when u get older and make better money. You are the winner they are losers, no offence to your family. \ud83d\ude05",

Well look no further.\n\nThe 1999 Toyota Corolla.\n\nLet's talk about features. Bluetooth: nope Sunroof: nope Fancy wheels: nope Rear view camera: nope...but it's got a transparent rear window and you have a fucking neck that can turn.\n\nLet me tell you a story. One day my Corolla started making a strange sound. I didn't give a shit and ignored it. It went away. The End.\n\nYou could take the engine out of this car, drop it off the Golden Gate Bridge, fish it out of the water a thousand years later, put it in the trunk of the car, fill the gas tank up with Nutella, turn the key, and this puppy would fucking start right up.\n\nThis car will outlive you, it will outlive your children.\n\nThings this car is old enough to do: Vote: yes Consent to sex: yes Rent a car: it IS a car\n\nThis car's got history. It's seen some shit. People have done straight things in this car. People have done gay things in this car. It's not going to judge you like a fucking Volkswagen would.\n\nInteresting facts: This car's exterior color is gray, but it's interior color is grey. In the owner's manual, oil is listed as \"optional.\" When this car was unveiled at the 1998 Detroit Auto Show, it caused all 2,000 attendees to spontaneously yawn. The resulting abrupt change in air pressure inside the building caused a partial collapse of the roof. Four people died. The event is chronicled in the documentary \"Bored to Death: The Story of the 1999 Toyota Corolla\"\n\nYou wanna know more? Great, I had my car fill out a Facebook survey. Favorite food: spaghetti Favorite tv show: Alf Favorite band: tie between Bush and the Gin Blossoms\n\nThis car is as practical as a Roth IRA. It's as middle-of-the-road as your grandpa during his last Silver Alert. It's as utilitarian as a member of a church whose scripture is based entirely on water bills.\n\nWhen I ran the CarFax for this car, I got back a single piece of paper that said, \"It's a Corolla. It's fine.\"\n\nLet's face the facts, this car isn't going to win any beauty contests, but neither are you. Stop lying to yourself and stop lying to your wife. This isn't the car you want, it's the car you deserve: The fucking 1999 Toyota Corolla.",

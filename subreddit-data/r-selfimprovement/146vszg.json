    "postText": "I can't talk to people my age, nor can I make friends. \n\nI started college last year and I tried talking to people but everyone seemed to have friends after 2 days and I was alone. I dropped out due to medical reasons but It's discouraging me from starting again.\n\nSometimes I think I might have autism because it's so hard for me.  When I'm in a social place im completely drained at the end of the day and when there is a social activity coming up I am stressed about it for months.\n\nNow I am 19, scared to go to college and I have no skills or friends. I start again in September and I'm already stressing myself out about it",

            "comment": "First and foremost, your problems are valid and these are issues many face and in that regard have tested solutions to. \n\nA few potential avenues we can go:\n\n1) You may simply just need the \u201cexercise\u201d of socializing in lower and gradually increasing doses and frequency/occasion to catch your social battery up. Much like a tendon or ligamental sprain or micro tear for a muscle that\u2019s not used to working out that then suddenly works out a lot. Your brain can experience a sprain from suddenly socializing a lot from whatever your previous baseline is (social fatigue). In this case you rest up until you feel ready again and begin doing simple things like practicing ordering at a coffee shop, saying \u201chi\u201d to neighbors in passing, speaking to a classmate. Remembering to take rest needed when you feel close to that limit, and not mentally punish yourself for being withdrawn/recharging.\n\n2) You can share these concerns with a doctor and get a referral to therapy. Social anxiety can also (and very commonly) is the byproduct of some type of conditioning or physiologic response where for a multitude of reasons both conditioned (subconsciously learned) and/or natural we produce more epinephrine (adrenaline) in certain social settings. Therapy can give you a guide to slowly retrain your brain to not release epinephrine. Moreover, therapy plus medication can be a great combo that can give your brain both the chemical nudge and social exercise (like physical therapy) needed to become comfortable \u201cexercising\u201d on your own.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s very frustrating and don\u2019t feel the need to catch up to others or push yourself far beyond your limit if your burnt out. Rest, relax, and pick the route you feel best when you\u2019re not thinking with burnout or anxiety. \n\nTLDR: Practice or practice with medical help.",

Insurances grip on healthcare is a shame in the US and I wish it wasn\u2019t so hard to obtain basic services.\n\nNot to impose the idea; however, you should check if your college offers any free psych counseling. It\u2019s not quite the same as therapy with a psychiatrist but it\u2019s pretty darn close. I\u2019ve found those resources helpful when I was doing undergrad. Moreover, it could be worth it to have a professional evaluate for depression, which can manifest as \u201canxious distress\u201d as well, as that could get you into therapy and hit both of your birds with one stone. Not saying you have that of course; however, it could open up the discussion for treatment.\n\nOther than that I wish you the best with your journey through this. It\u2019s challenging, but there are always people there to help.",

I am somebody who absolutely HATES reading books, and haven't read an entire book before this one, since probably 8th grade. Their are so many tips that legitimately helped so much in being able to talk to people. It is not some magical fix that once you read the book, your social anxiety is gone, but if you put effort into learning the things the author teaches, and trying your best to incorporate the tips into your daily life, you will 100% see improvements in your social anxiety. He explains everything very well, and gives examples for how each tip works. For example instead of just telling you \"make eye contact\", he delves deeper into it and uses personal examples to further explain why eye contact is important and how it changes how people will view and treat you.",

    "postText": "So the last 3 years have been a complete mess for me, I lost my grand parents and my fianc\u00e9 also dumped me. I have been really lost for a while but wanted to start to motivate myself so I am going to start a 90 day transformation but would also love to get feedback, for the moment I am planning to get in shape by practicing combat sports 3 times a week, trying to read a book a week and meditating 10 minutes daily. I also am planning to get a new source of income so I am also planning to include it into the 90 days challenge, my plan is to start tomorrow so if anyone has any advice or something extra that I should aim for daily I would really appreciate it. My plan is to also do a weekly update so I am also accountable in a way. I have been training combat sports for a month so I don\u2019t see how doing it 3 times (or more) a week like a problem. Also any advice in books to read or topics to learn that can help with the income objective would be appreciated.",

Last time i did it, i was planning to cut a lot of bad habits at once for like 2 months or something like that, and after a couple days i was doing like 15% of the things i said i would do, but one of this things were cutting out sugar of my diet and since then, i've been 100% sugar free. Looking back at the challenge itself it may look like it failed, but now i realize how hard just cutting the sugar actually was, and i'm proud of it. so if you can just take 1 good thing out of all the tasks you're planning, be grateful for it and keep challenging yourself till you can get all you want. good luck bro",

Adding combat sports, reading, meditating, and seeking a new source of income are great steps.\r For some extra daily goals, consider incorporating a healthy habit like drinking enough water, getting enough sleep, or trying a new skill or hobby that interests you. It can add some variety and keep things fresh during your transformation.\r  \n\r  \nAs for accountability, you can try using the Forfeit app, where you set tasks for yourself and need to provide evidence of completion or lose some money. It adds a fun and motivating twist to help you stay on track.\r Remember, progress takes time, so be patient and kind to yourself along the way.",

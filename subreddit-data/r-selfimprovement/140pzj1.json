    "postText": "A big part of my recovery has been focused on relationships and I\u2019ve been doing what my therapist calls \u2018relational therapy\u2019 for the better part of a year now.\n\nToday I turned down seeing my sister and my brother for my birthday. Recently I bailed on visiting my Mum. I am very cynical about relationships of all kinds - friendships, working, and it has affected my dating life too. I recently called it off with someone I really liked because I was insecure about whether or not they were really interested in me.\n\nIt\u2019s not an intense paranoia or anything, but it is a cynicism - it\u2019s having low expectations, not being surprised with being disappointed, expecting to be judged and hurt. \n\nOf course it comes from a huge place of insecurity, and it comes from a real need to self-preserve against everything. It\u2019s great building an independence, and I\u2019m living well, but I really am turning people away and against me because deep down I\u2019m scared of being hurt and not trusting people I like, and love, to be sincere in their care and interest in me. \n\nAt the same time, a lot of my work has been in developing boundaries and learning to actually care about myself.\n\nMy therapist and I have noted how sensitive, defensive and reactive I am. I would say I am an emotionally healthier person, but sometimes I make myself miserable with my own \u2018I\u2019ll do it myself, fuck everyone else\u2019 attitude. I\u2019m really very lonely to be honest, despite having a fairly active life.\n\nIt makes me really sad! I\u2019m really not sure how to approach it. Of course I\u2019m going to talk this through with my therapist, but I wanted some insights and opinions from people who have maybe learned a thing or two. Any thoughts on what\u2019s going on, or what I could try keep in mind?",

When we accept ourselves as we are and love ourselves, we feel like we don't need anything from anyone and have a lot to offer to such a degree that it's easier to dip our toe back in",

I think just writing this post alone is a good example of how it\u2019s going \ud83d\ude05\n\nIt is difficult when a lot of that self-criticism is so deeply embedded into a psyche. The big goal for me is to dig it out - and that means accepting myself and meeting myself I suppose :)",

    "postText": "I confronted my team about an issue that I noticed regarding how our team meeting was being run. I brought up the issue and asked for actionable items to resolve the mismanagement.\n\nCoincidentally, I had my one-on-one with my manager right after, where I used this as a topic as well. I told him how it was a difficult topic to bring up during the meeting which took me weeks of procrastination (I am a few years into my career and 8 months into the job). To which my manager said, \"I thought you were always like this. I didn't think you would have difficulty bringing this up. You run meetings very well, your communication is great, and you are doing great.\"\n\nI could not help but smile and laugh. This is something I struggled with so much for almost a decade, especially since I have a baby face, which has a different level of struggle. My communication, self-esteem, and confidence were sky-high. It's one thing to believe that you are improving. It's another thing to be complimented by others on something you have worked so hard to change. It's like all my efforts towards pushing my boundaries constantly are paying off.\n\nPrior to this, I started feeling a lot better about myself and feel that my confidence is growing with each and every interaction, and I am overcoming my anxiety as well.\n\nI hope everyone who is building themselves gets recognized!",

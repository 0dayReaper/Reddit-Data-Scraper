    "postText": " \n\nI\u2019ve been on a mission to cut back on screen time lately and came across phone detoxing. I\u2019ve already seen some improvement with what I\u2019ve been doing. So far I\u2019ve turned off my non-human notifications and forced myself to not sleep with my phone. I\u2019ve also downloaded this app called \u201cPresent: Limit Screen Time App\u201d and have loved being able to reduce my screen time along with my friends. I\u2019ve been able to significantly reduce my screen time with the app but I still want to do better.\n\nHas anyone done a phone detox before? I\u2019m interested in possibly trying it but want to see if anyone has had any success or wanted to share their experience with it.",

It takes some time to get used to it but when the benefits start rolling in it feels great! Personally i slept better, could focus better and my eyes were not so irritated all the time! Good luck!\n\nEDIT: Typos",

I\u2019m interested in possibly trying it but want to see if anyone has had any success or wanted to share their experience with it.\n\nI have had a Sailfish phone (linux smartphone, that can run some Android apps) for ages, but bought an iPhone for the LIDAR (I work in VR and needed to scan things in 3D). \n\nI ended up trying the iPhone as my main phone for a few weeks, it totally had me hooked after a week. I went from my normal phone useage (maybe an hour a day, mostly spotify and signal) to around 6 hours a day. So I moved back to the Sailfish phone. \n\nThen I moved to a Nokia 8110, and now have an AGM M7. The Nokia was great but no Signal or Spotify, the AGM has buttons and a tiny screen, but does run Signal/spotify (And bank ID stuff etc). So it's my perfect dumbphone. \n\nIt's 100% a recommendation, get on ebay, grab an old Nokia, move the SIM over and give it a month. It's nuts how big a difference it makes.",

IT AGAIN IS A TRAP AND A CYCLE PLEADE DONT ITS WHAT MADE QUITTING LAST SO LONG but yea if any platform that was useful to me was youtube ( has its addictive useless side as well esp if youre consuming swlf improvement content and not applying ) because people put years of experience and knowledge into a short 10 min video sometimes so yk it\u2019s very helpful and legit has so many things that can help you like workouts , meditations all for free yk something you alr know . but if you have FOMO like legit WHAT FEAR like fear of not being relatable or not being updated with what some celeb is doing NO WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH UR LIFE ? no tell me like legit have the fear of being AVERAGE ?!! ik tjis is kinda harsh but i\u2019m nit good at typing ut out but speaking of it \u2026 ever since I quit I started becoming happy , proud and started loving myself more and becoming a high achiever \u2026..",

I would say get out of the trap these apps are made for ur time and attention which are your most valuable things in life that can build you to whoever u desire to be where you put ur time in and sacrifices is what u value and what builds ur desired future . I hope the best mate good luck \u2026",

            "comment": "I think what helped me is the hammer-nail analogy. A hammer isn't innately bad just because we can use it to kill people. When you're trying to hit a nail, it's the tool for the job. Phones and screens are just tools but as a society we can very readily misuse them. Took a while to just remember what tasks I wanted to achieve and then use screen time to help me out in achieving them. Its like if you go into a shop knowing you need to get toilet paper Vs going in just for a browse and coming out with a trolley of random things that you never actually needed and a little more out of pocket.\n\nSo with my phone I use it mainly as a notepad to record my thoughts if I'm in a place where it's hard to write on paper, on my commutes it can help me sneak in a little extra time to learn French or Spanish, can have a few games of chess if I'm stuck waiting for a train that's delayed, I use it for hotspot when I'm working in places with no WiFi and music to get an extra rep in at the gym. Outside of that I'm not that fussed by it. Don't have any social media minus Reddit and then I tend to give myself only a little bit and then I go off again to focus on hobbies or work or family. I'm a bit of an outcast so Reddit is like having a whole pool of people to talk to on topics I enjoy and I don't really see it as a waste of time. Noone else would want to listen about my deadlift PRs or the impact of AI on philosophy or how my cherry tomatoes are doing. \n\nI've gone weeks without my phone as I lose it regularly. I'd recommend it definitely if you have a habit of whipping your phone out just to check notifications often. I've been phone free for so long now that I never touch it out of habit - only when I need it. \n\n But I've never gone without my laptop as I'm a computational scientist by trade. But screens have made learning so accessible for me though. I can learn languages in my own time. I can learn programming. I've watched YouTube videos on how to do DIY tasks. I set up a vegetable patch using YouTube videos and I got into sports biomechanics using podcasts, and online resources. \n\nI do make a habit of turning all tech off a long while before bed though just for sleep benefits and the interference of the light emission. I fall asleep faster during reading physical books so that's just a habit now that evening time I zone out of it unless I'm working overtime or watching a movie with my husband.\n\n\n\n\n..",

            "comment": "Oh yea and in this modern new world order, it's very needed. The problem to me isn't so much social media and the smart phones, but it's overusing it and not actually using it for benefits strictly. To be fair these apps are developed algorithmicly to be addictive so it's not all on the user. \n\nI use my phone for calculator alot and for timers and other real world scenarios along with occasional googling (I have since even cut down on that to get back some of the critical thinking I have lost over the years due to screen). The thing that helped me the most was literally uninstalling the apps. For some it may be hard still as even using the phone sets off a trigger moment for habits so it takes some rewiring. But you always take advantage of the routines and shortcuts to be able to make apps completely oscolete for a length of time so you can't use easily. \n\nIn the end, it's up to the person, if the person genuinely wants to quit or cut down, they can regardless of the method. It's sort of like your health, people take it for granted until it's in jeopardy. Some people only learn through massive trauma and health deterioration after the age of 25 bc habits can really be brainwashing.",

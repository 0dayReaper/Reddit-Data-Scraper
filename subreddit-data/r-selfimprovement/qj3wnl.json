I learned that you are a young teenager starting to learn more about yourself, doing the very brave thing of reaching out for help and facing the way you feel. That's admirable, I was definitely not ready for any of that at your age. I also noticed you made an effort to include a friend in a gaming squad, although I didn't read the post because it was about a game I don't know anyway. However that shows kindness and care. You seem like a great kid that's gonna grow up into a wonderful adult someday. Keep at it, you're doing great.",

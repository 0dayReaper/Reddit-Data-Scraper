    "postText": "I've discovered my most elusive unhealthy patterns\n\nHi everyone, i recently had a realization about my unhealthy patterns. I've always been a people pleaser, not in the strictest definition of it, but that's the easiest way to describe it.\n\nOn the other hand I've developed unhealthy, mildly manipulatory tactics in my day to day life. I'm coping since and trying to eliminate this tendency. Probably correlated to people pleasing and to the fact that i often find myself in leading positions in most of the social contexts I've been in, even if i never wanted it. This has led me to indulge in such behaviors to avoid useless conflicts and chaos in the groups of people I've been in. But it doesn't stop there.\nI akso tend to make people feel judged, and i hate it about myself, i just want to be a positive figure for others, i surely want to share what I've learned, but without making others feel lesser. These character defects are very detrimental to me and my perception of myself. I don't like them at all, and keep struggling to make them go away from my behavior.\n\nAt the same time, I've noticed that the only people that aren't built in this way are the ones that have felt acceptance, tolerance, and love since the beginning of their lives. A healthy space to grow let's say. I did not have it, at all, it was the exact opposite, I didn't lack food but was in constant fight of flight let's say, and the things that I've seen and lived i wouldn't wish them on nobody. This contributed heavily to my \"savior\" complex/people pleasing, but had a HUGE impact in the developement of my dark traits.\n\nThose judgemental subconscious processes are deeply ingrained into my mental patterns, because that's all I've ever seen and learned, starting from my family. Not considering the most obvious abuses, this way of behaving towards another being is very shitty and subtle and I've noticed only now, at 25 that I've never ever been comfortable around my family even when the most blatant abuses weren't happening because of this. I have so much anger.. \n\nSince i was little I've always been kind to everything and everyone, never mean, intentionally or not. And it's something that i really liked about me, but It started to become covered in layers of mud that the further i dig, the further i find something else.\n\nThe point is, I'm still growing and learning and i want to keep doing it, and had my successes; still, these things are so deeply rooted in my behavior that i need new tools to make significant change.\n\nI know where it all started, why i perceive things and people in this unhealthy way, but those behaviors bypass my conscious barriers and i still filter those thoughts very poorly. I'm judgemental, critical, analytical for everything due to that, it's not all bad, this led me to a good position and to achieve a High awareness about a lot of things till this point, but I don't want to be critical with people as i am with concepts.\n\nHow do i make others feel good about themselves and stop my constant judgement and mildly manipulatory behavior given that i have something missing in me and that these behaviors helped me to survive childhood?",

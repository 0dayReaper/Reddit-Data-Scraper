    "postText": "This is due to our personality and learned behavior. It is called self-compassion, and if you\u2019re this hard on yourself then it is something that you lack. This lacking can also cause a lack of confidence and self-esteem.\n\nThere are a few easy exercises to fix low self-compassion.  \nThe 1st, which personally worked for me is positive affirmations. This technique is when you take 5 minutes out of your day to stand in front of the mirror and say things such as \u2018I am beautiful\u2019 or \u2018I am confident\u2019. It will be uncomfortable at first, but you\u2019ll get used to it. And there is a high chance that it will remove your lack of self-compassion. But if this doesn\u2019t work then I recommend trying the 2nd exercise.  \nThe 2nd exercise is gratitude. This can be done in many different ways, but all it is is the appreciation of what you have in life. I personally do this through journalling, every morning I journal and label 5 things that I am grateful for today e.g. \u2018A warm bed\u2019 or \u2018Lots of kind friends\u2019. This will make you feel like your one bad thought is irrelevant compared to all of the amazing stuff that you have in your life.  \nIf you use either of these 2 tips every day consistently, for as little as 1 week you will feel the effects on your self-compassion and will stop being so hard on yourself.",

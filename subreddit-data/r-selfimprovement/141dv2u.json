    "postText": "At 16 or 17 I had a sexual encounter with a woman and at the time I knew nothing about sex love protection etc...well a few days later I noticed something didn't feel right. I didn't think much of it back then but now and over the last 10 years or so it is a constant on my mind. I can't seem to shake feeling like used goods. I feel dirty and this virus has taken a toll on my mental health certainly. The fact that its incurable is hard to deal with. I'm a decent tall pretty chill guy and I always imagined what life would be like without this virus. On a good note it caused me to do alot of soul searching and I have definitely learned alot about my self. But man this has had a huge effect on how I see myself in this world. Has anyone gone through this or something similar? It feels really debilitating and approaching 40 in a few years it still haunts me in very challenging ways.",

I got STD tested and by the glory of God everything came back negative now in the span of waiting for the test results I was researching and researching stuff about herpes bc in my mind I though I had it. So even when I got the nevgatice results I was like it could be a false negative. I literally was depressed on thanksgiving, Christmas. So I then kissed a boy a couple of pecks and then started freaking out again that I had herpes and then one day I said to myself \u201cI\u2019m still living I\u2019m still breathing and I\u2019m still healthy\u201d so even if I do have herpes from kissing this guy everything is going to be okay. I think your post said you\u2019re 40 so if you\u2019re 40 you\u2019ve had it for a while and look you\u2019ve made it this far you\u2019ve made it this far that\u2019s an accomplishment. From my research a lot of people have herpes and yes it\u2019s not curable but you\u2019re able to live with it. I even think my dad has it bc he got a cold sore. He\u2019s literally one of the happiest people I\u2019ve ever met. I know you feel damaged and stuff but you aren\u2019t. As long as you\u2019re honest with your partners and people I don\u2019t even think they\u2019ll make too much of a big deal about it. I\u2019ve read a lot on Reddit of people being born with it and just getting cold sores and that it\u2019s even medicine for it. Live your life and don\u2019t let the chance of possibly getting cold sores ruin it. I\u2019ve even seen people say that they have partners who have herpes but they don\u2019t.",

But, I'm glad that I still have the ability to walk to a park nearby and see people and to feel touch of the soil/ground on my bare feet",

The best I could say is try to make this unfortunate irreversible thing something that works for you. Like for example, the ways that you tell people that you have herpes could be ways to demonstrate your ethical character of transparency, having strong values because you know what you should have done in order to prevent this and you live by those values now. In general just try to let how you communicate about your virus illustrate your personal character and know it will help you match up with people who have also had hard experiences which taught them the importance of caution and in depth communication etc, and this will help connect you to people who have strong integrity and are trustworthy just as you are.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m so sorry to hear you are struggling with this for so long. I really think that Herpes needs to be destigmatized. It\u2019s estimated that 1 in 5 males and 1 in 4 women have it. Many people do not ever have breakouts and never know they have it. I found out through a blood test and have never had symptoms, I don\u2019t even know how long I had it. It\u2019s very manageable with meds, and it\u2019s not an evil or dirty thing, it\u2019s a skin condition. It\u2019s in the Sam family as chicken pox and shingles, and it\u2019s the virus that causes cold sores, so while it sucks when you experience a breakout, it\u2019s not uncommon and it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. I would encourage you to let go of your shame, work with a therapist is you need to. Don\u2019t let this take up much space in your head.",

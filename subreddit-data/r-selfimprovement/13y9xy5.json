    "postText": "1. Don't assume a 'no' for someone else. Let them make that choice.\r  \n2. Believe in serendipity, not coincidences.\r  \n3. For decision-making, resolve automatically by (1) setting a deadline, or (2) picking the less enjoyable option.\r  \n4. Utilize email reminders for important follow-ups on specified dates.\r  \n5. When in doubt, simply do what is right.\r  \n6. The expectation of progress is key for motivation. It's hard to be motivated if you don't know your next step or the end goal.\r  \n7. Clarity is key. E.g., \"AGI takeoff fast\" - define each term: \"AGI\", \"takeoff\", \"fast\".\r  \n8. Use one-hour timers for brainstorming in Google docs and three-minute timers to jot down immediate next steps.\r  \n9. Knowledge is a stepping stone. The more you know, the easier it is to plan your next steps.\r  \n10. Naps don't necessarily mean sleep. Your brain is never fully off; it's about resting your mind.\r  \n11. Without scheduled time for important goals, you can't really claim to have any.\r  \n12. Ask yourself, what is something you're avoiding out of fear? Be specific.\r  \n13. Consider, what are you hiding due to shame? Be honest.\r  \n14. Think, what infuriates you? Define it.\r  \n15. Every project has a preliminary and final version. The initial can often be done in just 10% of the time if you set a timer for 5-10-15 minutes.\r  \n16. Don't shy away from asking people \"What do you do?\" as your first question at social events.\r  \n17. Seek out the most unique individuals at gatherings.\r  \n18. Working on complex issues requires a significant amount of bravery. Embrace your fears.\r  \n19. Just because you feel strongly about something doesn't mean you're correct.\r  \n20. Even if your overarching intuition is correct, without concrete actions, your assumptions might be off.\r  \n21. Pursue the truth and test your assumptions. Don't settle for winning arguments.\r  \n22. Avoid postponing important beliefs. Always strive to think from the ground up, not based on someone else's beliefs or what's considered reasonable.\r  \n23. Be wary if you haven't experienced any awkwardness today.\r  \n24. Thinkers believe thinking is key; doers believe action is key. Find a balance.\r  \n25. If something is occupying your mind, jot it down. It'll help you focus on the task at hand.\r  \n26. If a task involves a sequence of actions you've done thrice, create a checklist.\r  \n27. If a thought disturbs you, remind yourself it's okay to let it go.\r  \n28. Use tools like Anki, snooze tabs, and Asana to manage your questions and ideas for later.\r  \n29. If a work location doesn't naturally suit you, switch places. Don't force it.\r  \n30. Treat everyone as a friend. Don't hesitate to send cold emails.\r  \n31. Keep a visible timer to ensure you're staying on track and not getting stuck.\r  \n32. Recall your shower thoughts. They're often insightful.\r  \n33. Low social status often hides untapped potential.\r  \n34. Living in areas with high standards, like the Bay area, can provide a significant boost in drive and insights.\r  \n35. It's natural to feel like you're lagging behind at times. It's part of the journey.\r  \n36. If you rarely experience a certain emotion, your brain might be suppressing it.\r  \n37. Prefer reading books over listening to them for better retention.\r  \n38. People often project their motivations onto others.\r  \n39. People often project their fears onto others as a form of self-protection.\r  \n40. You have control over what to pay",

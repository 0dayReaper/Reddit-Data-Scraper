    "postText": "I'm a first year undergraduate recently start my bachelors\nThe timetable starts early in the morning due to the huge \"vacation days\" like gap ruined my wake up times (ofc it's myself to blame)\n\nI am a deep sleeper and sleep late on random times, like just before midnight, few minutes or hours after midnight. But every weekday I have to wake up at 5.30am.\n\nAll these days I slept countless times on bus and almost missed my stop. All cuz of drowsing off. I tried to listen to fast pace music but it just became a nice good pillow. \n\nI think this also affects me when in lectures. No matter how interactive the session is I yawn multiple times. I want it to stop. \n\nI want to know ways to get an energetic wake up. Or how to properly rest to recharge in short time. Or a good and practical morning routine.\nPlease help",

    "postText": "ever since i started being active a few years ago, i\u2019ve been in pain and haven\u2019t been able to get fit.\n\ni developed tarsal tunnel syndrome after i started skateboarding and ive done a decent amount of PT, orthotics, and a numbing shot to my nerve, but the problem persists. on top of that i have neck, knee, and back pain, and i keep pulling muscles in my back, groin, and hamstrings when i stretch or exercise. i cant engage in my favorite activities (skateboarding, ice skating, biking, walking) more than 1 time a week without excessive pain. when i do my PT exercises at home, it feels like it\u2019s causing more pain and muscle pulls.  no matter what i do, i don\u2019t feel like my body ever gets stronger.\n\nam i doing something wrong? too much stretching not enough strengthening? doing it in the wrong order? i\u2019m only 26 and i feel like my body cannot handle exercise, but i\u2019m an athletic person and i want to get fit and be able to run. any advice?",

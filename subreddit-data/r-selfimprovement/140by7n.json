    "postText": "Not sure if others have experienced this, but lately everything I do I feel my inner child getting so excited for and feeling like we are finally one of the \u201ccool people\u201d I used to look up to as a child. I\u2019m almost 24f, and growing up my family was always very strict on me. Didn\u2019t have friends just always long-term boyfriends, never played sports or was in any school clubs, and always had a negative self image due to being chubby. Now that I\u2019m in my 20s I\u2019ve been dating women, getting really toned, surrounding myself with incredible friends and experiences (especially EDM festivals) and I constantly feel my inner child SCREAMING of joy whenever I get to do cool shit. Not sure if this is called something else or just finally growing up and realizing I have the power to create my own reality\u2026 and I\u2019m creating a really awesome one at that. At times I want to feel more in control and smooth with these new experiences, but I can\u2019t help but feel like a little kid that\u2019s going to Disney world every time things in my life appear exactly how I dreamed of. Does this happen to anyone???",

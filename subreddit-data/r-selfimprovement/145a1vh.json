I won\u2019t go into great detail as to why I feel the way that I do but I really feel as though I need a bigger change in my life. \n\nI\u2019m planning on taking a solo trip to the Philippines around my birthday in January for about a week. I\u2019ll try to visit a few more countries before I make my final decision. \n\nI\u2019ve thought about going back to school for a higher salary but I really don\u2019t want to take out any more loans. Saving up 20-30k wouldn\u2019t be too hard &amp; I would be able to work remotely. \n\nHas anybody done anything like this? How did you do it &amp; how has your life changed because of your decision?",

If there is something specific you dislike about the area you live in, you could always just try moving to a different city or state first. The US is huge and has something to offer just about anyone whether you're looking for the quiet life or big city living. If you're dealing with something that you don't know how to address and you think moving might help you reset, that's fine. But if you don't also try to address the thing that bothers you, you'll likely end up feeling the same way.\n\nI can share my own experience with moving. I've moved a lot in my life, including to different countries. Any personal issues I was dealing with would always follow me. The initial change might be a distraction at first but distracting myself from my issues didn't solve them. I had to deal with those issues directly.",

Although they\u2019re my problems to deal with, my environment has always played a huge role in triggering my extreme lows. I don\u2019t expect my internal state to change at the expense of changing my environment alone. Maybe I could build the life that I want just by moving to a different state or city but this is where I\u2019m at for now.  \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m blessed to live the way that I do here in the states. I\u2019ve traveled west, southern, eastern, rural &amp; big city. In my experience people are a-lot more friendly in other states (not always). Maybe it\u2019s just here in Ohio. Of course traveling before making a decision to relocate permanently would be best to find a place that I\u2019d feel comfortable living in but, the idea of such a drastic change sort of resonates with me.",

You certainly don't want to end up in a worse situation. Maybe make a pros/cons list for Ohio and for each potential destination to get all your thoughts organized.\n\nAlso look into the laws in that country. I know that in some asian countries they don't treat foreigners as well as they treat their own. Like they'll openly charge you more because they assume you're a tourist with money. You also might not be able to own land/property, only rent. Stuff like that. (source: am half asian) Just some examples of things to look out for when you're picking your destination.\r  \n\r  \nI actually lived in Ohio for about 10 years. It certainly wasn't perfect but overall it was fine for me. But that's just my own experience as your average white-ish male. You mentioned quite a few topics in your reasoning. I'm so sorry you've been experiencing all that, it sounds like you've had a rough time there.

But your life is a reflection of your habits. And if you move you\u2019ll just bring your habits with you.\n\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t move, but take some time to reflect first. Is your shit together? IMO this is when someone should move. Are you hitting the gym regularly? Have you worked on making friends? Advancing your career? Do you already live on your on and are financially independent? These are prerequisites to moving IMO.\n\nNow you can also consider moving to another state. That would be a LOT easier. The US is so much damn easier to live it\u2019s not even funny. Especially when it comes to travel, healthcare, finding work, etc. first world countries are probably a lot easier than third world countries but even those will be so much different. Like you\u2019ve gotta relearn everything.\n\nNot saying this to disuade you. I just discovered self improvement 3 years ago and am so happy I didn\u2019t move because deep down I was thinking success and happiness would fall into my lap this way and it was unrealistic. \n\nI am considering moving states though because I live in a super cold state and am tired of the fucking cold. \n\nAlso one more thought - before you move somewhere in another country try living if there for 3 months. That will be enough time to determine if it\u2019s worth it - I did that with the Virgin Islands and realized it wasn\u2019t where I wanted to be. I\u2019m glad i didn\u2019t cut home ties and sign a year lease there. \n\nGood luck.",

Even tried brazillian jui jitsu. Found a way to double my salary without a promotion, moved out of my mom\u2019s house, made a ton of friends, got my credit together, stopped drinking &amp; smoking, took in as much positive information as possible. I didn\u2019t even listen to music or watch tv other than videos on YouTube that aligned with my goals. Throughout this time period I made the most progress that I had ever made in my life. For whatever reason it also felt like one of the most depressing points in my life to be completely honest. I came to the conclusion that it was probably the company that I was keeping or just the environment that I kept finding myself in trying to hold onto old relationships, so I\u2019ve slowly been parting with the friends that I did have. Other than maybe one person, nobody else really wanted to live the lifestyle that I\u2019ve been working for. \n\nMy mental was pretty messed up after a while &amp; I fell into some old habits. I didn\u2019t keep up with everything, doubting that it was even worth it to \u201ctry so hard\u201d still not feeling fulfilled regardless of the accomplishments that I was clearing off of my list of goals. (Probably searching for validation &amp; not finding what I was looking for, dealing with self-doubt). \n\nLately I\u2019ve been doing everything I personally can to keep my mind clear &amp; stay focused. Healthier habits &amp; all in a \u201chealthy amount\u201d. I\u2019m a firm believer in the idea that happiness &amp; success is not the light at end of the tunnel, instead there is a fulfilled life &amp; that\u2019s when we\u2019re able to move on. \n\nI really have no other choice but to keep going, retaining my most desirable traits &amp; habits to get to the next stage in my life. Not to be morbid but we could go at anytime, so the idea was to do something \u201cbig\u201d to look back on &amp; say \u201cI\u2019m glad I made the decision to just go for it\u201d.\n\nRealistically, moving anywhere permanently (for the rest of my life) other than where my primary family is located is pretty aggressive, I must admit, however if that leap even lasted for a few years I feel I\u2019d be pretty satisfied. It\u2019s a pretty far mark to strike on at the moment so I\u2019ll see in due time. \n\nAgain, thank you for your input. I\u2019m really just trying to find a way to keep that lust &amp; passion for life going. Where I wake up every morning &amp; I thank God for the opportunity to experience another day being me.",

I was scrolling through this and i wanted to mention that i came to Paraguay for similar reasons (healthcare, taxes, extremely low lows) and i joined a humanitarian iniative so i could give myself a reason to keep going on with life( i wasnt suicidal but i had no purpose) and its helped me see who i am. I dont like who i am. They, the iniative, is trying to help me with this. My point is, from my experiences in life if your journey is calling you, always heed the call. You are living in harmony it reads like, so have the faith in your uncertainty and always make an informed decision. You are on the right path.",

She was telling me about how she was planning on leaving the country &amp; hopefully relocating permanently. \nMy cousin moved to Japan after she finished university &amp; she never had anything bad to say about the experience. \n\nMy concern isn\u2019t really \u201cwomen\u201d but just being able to live a happy &amp; healthy life that I enjoy. I know that\u2019s sort of broad but to say but, simply if I could leave everything behind to become a monk in Asia, I think it would do a lot more good for me than bad. (Not saying that I want to become a monk but hopefully you get the idea)\n\nMaybe I just need to get away from the city &amp; move somewhere with more of a natural landscape. I really resonate with the guys that I\u2019ve seen giving testimonies on YT about how they left the city to live at abroad with no social media, drugs, alcohol, etc. just a completely different environment &amp; lifestyle than what I\u2019ve grown up in. Yea I could live however I want here in the states but I\u2019ll always feel like I need to get away for some reason. I should probably go over that with my therapist lol. \n\nGranted I would like to start a family &amp; all that good stuff but the short answer is no. Not a blackpiller in search of a foreign woman.",

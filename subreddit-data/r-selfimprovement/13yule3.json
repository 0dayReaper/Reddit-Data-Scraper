    "postText": "After college graduation was taken over by the pandemic, I lost myself. I lost direction, confidence, and purpose. Like everyone\u2026I suppose. \n\nUp until now, nothing has changed. I try to make small strides to become an independent illustrative artist and content creator, as that is my dream, but I fall short every time. \n\nAfter being on antidepressants for a little over a year, I decided to stop them. During my time on them, I noticed my neurosis dim, and something else took over - constant exhaustion and no drive to do anything. Now, it feels like I\u2019m neurotic again with no energy to help myself manage that constant mental commotion. \n\nThe point of me writing this is to say that I\u2019m very, deeply sad. Im frustrated as well. I wonder when me trying and failing trying and failing will finally result in something that breathes life into me again. I\u2019ve always felt like a failure at everything, I just want to feel something better than that. I want to trust myself to follow through with tasks and goals to get to where I want to be. \n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with me? Why can\u2019t I show up for myself?",

Maybe experiment with new possibilities \n\nAlso do you think you might be really hard on yourself? You're only human, maybe your body and mind are telling you something. It sounds like your experiencing burn out. Maybe find things that relax you or bring you excitement, vacation? Nature? Family? Showing up for yourself doesnt just mean being productive! And beating yourself up for not being productive enough isnt going to bring back the feeling of purpose. \n\nMedical wise I'm no doctor, I dont understand your medical issues nearly enough to give you any advice, I hope your getting the care you need for those though!",

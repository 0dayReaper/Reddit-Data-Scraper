    "postText": "Hey,\n\nI just want to thank anyone who is reading. \n\nI'm a 30 year old that just finished a program for a new career. I turn 31 in a few months and I'm petrified. I just got out of a 4 year relationship, I feel so lost and confused. I know being single is the right choice for now, because I won't be able to maintain a healthy relationship until I love myself. All of my friends are getting married and having kids. I've been in the same state my entire life and I feel stuck. I feel like I've never taken a risk and I don't know who I am. I've been extremely depressed (got diagnosed with bipolar a couple months ago) and I drink pretty heavily to numb the pain. I just started to work out again and it's helping with a routine. However, being in the same state and doing the same things every single day are exhausting me. i understand I could just move, but i would have to save some finances first. I've tried journaling, \"making your bed\" all the cliche stuff people say. I just want advice from some everyday people on how to make life meaningful ad stop it from being so dull. Desperate at this point",

I might do 100 words each on my workout and diet for the day(physical), what I plan on learning(mental), what I want to create(spiritual), who I'd like to speak with(social), and where I plan on spending my money(financial).\n\nAt the end of the day, I'll do it all over again, figuring out what worked and what didn't. Maybe the workout is too strenuous, or I need to find an event to expand my social circle.",

            "comment": "Obviously it took a lot of practice over the years, but playing music and singing always helps me mitigate the depression and mundane daily tasks. Songs that resonate with me deeply, I learn and then play to let the emotions out.\n\nMy dog (siberian husky) also helps keep me out of my head. The daily walks and routine of that gets me out of bad thought patterns, though it can be a lot of work.\n\nHouse plants definitely changed my life a little bit. It brings me joy watering them &amp; speaking love &amp; appreciation to them. My little living air purifiers!\n\nFinally, you mentioned exercise, but have you tried yoga? I started hot yoga over 10 years ago, and I may not go consistently these days, but developing that practice has aided me in so many ways. Hot yoga just turns a pleasant meditative exercise, into a high intensity, low impact work out that benefits not just every major muscle group, but all vital organs as well. Highly recommend as one of the best things people could choose to do for their overall health.\n\nHope this helps! Best of luck friend. Keep your head up. It gets better. Coming from a 31 year old with plenty of shortcomings and successes. Life's a rollercoaster. Learn how to have fun/choose positivity even in the lows. More highs and loops and twists are coming.",

And my little brother died when I was 17.\n \nWhen you suffer a traumatic experience the stress/trauma/ experience is preserved in your body. It is not just about emotions.  It's about an instinctive state of anxiety/danger/numbness.\nA lot of people need to heal emotional and traumatic wounds. Some would say: well nothing traumatic happened to me...\nThey should Dig deep.Bc the experience of not being loved or being neglected or rejected is also powerfully painful.  And many don't count them as relevant. \nIf your heart &amp; your \"soul\" is sad. There's a reason why you feel that way. It's a symptom. \n\n-Go to a retreat ASAP. (It doesn't need to be religious. If you are religious go to a religious one. If you are  not theres retreats for people looking for their path in life and to conecct with themselves and with nature.). You need to break the routine.  Search for silence. Silence speaks to you.  The answers will come in the silence. \n(Don't do it alone.  It could be very painful. You need guidance)\n\n- friends,  friends, friends. Conecct with people. widen your social circle!!! \n\n- you need a father figure,  a coach... someone older... you can go for advise and support.  \n\n- therapy. \n\n\n Source: I was suicidal from 15 to twenty-something. It worked for me. \nI'm in my thirties now. My life change so much... that now is like. ... like I am a different person. In many ways. Difficult to describe. But it's the only way I can explain it. \nPs. Sorry for my poor English. \nBest wishes!",

            "comment": "Congratulation on finishing your program. You should be super proud of yourself for completing that! You\u2019re starting a new career. Count that as a fresh start. \n\nI also wanna congratulate on you on being newly single! Being single is a beautiful thing. There\u2019s sooooo many things you can learn about yourself moving forward. There\u2019s so much freedom as well. All the love you were giving to your partner you can give it all to yourself simply because you deserve it. \n\nFirst things first get into therapy. EVERYONE needs therapy. I had to go during the most depressing time of my life and it changed my life for the better. I never knew it could get so deep. It literally will allow you to pretty much untangle some knots you didn\u2019t even know existed. It allows you to be more mindful of your thought process. Bonus it\u2019s also great to have someone break down and teach you how to combat self inflicted negative thoughts. Think about it. It\u2019s a reason you never take risk. Therapy should help you unravel that and many other things.   \n\nTake the time to slow down and pay attention to yourself. Pay attention to your thoughts, your actions &amp; your habits. There\u2019s a reason you are where you are now. Hopefully this doesn\u2019t sound harsh but honestly that\u2019s what it comes down to. You are already in a great mindset to move forward because you recognized that you aren\u2019t satisfied with your life at the moment. That\u2019s your heart &amp; soul telling you that you\u2019re meant to do more. Embrace that. It\u2019s beautiful!\n\nOn the other hand, I would suggest challenging yourself to say YES to NEW things. Challenge yourself to try something new &amp; allow yourself to be HORRIBLE at it. Effort and enjoyment is all that matters. Example, if you\u2019re bored and decide to get some fresh air. Walk around town and tell yourself \u201c the first random shop/restaurant I see I\u2019m going to stop there and try it out no matter what.\u201d That would bring adventure in &amp; spontaneity. How fun! Create special events for yourself. \n(Taco Tuesday, Monday movie night, skincare Sunday, sight seeing Saturday). Gotta be creative! Bring back that child like mind that you have tucked away. Everybody has it. It\u2019s just as we get older &amp; life happens it kinda gets blurred out. Find it! Dust it off! \n\nOverall there\u2019s so much life to live. You just have to add a bit of color to your black and white page. \n\n\nOh &amp; read books! Cant for get about books LOL! \n\nLet me know if you need any suggestions. I got you! \n\nYou got this! Have fun!",

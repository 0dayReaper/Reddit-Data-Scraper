    "postText": "\\[sorry for possible English mistakes\\] \\[I posted also on r/Meditation\\]\n\nThrough therapy I've (28M) realized that one key element throughout my whole life is fear. Since I was a kid I had episodes of school phobia, a bit later deep fear of dinosaurs lol (I had a very vivid imagination as a kid and imagined they would come back to life), and since my teens and beginning of adulthood a very deep and paralyzing social phobia. I realized something wasn't right when I was eating lunch locked in the bathroom cubicle for the sixth time from my deep fear of lunch time at uni. I would spend parties locked in the bathroom and have panic attacks at uni, constant suicidal thoughts, and was very very afraid of going out with girls.\n\nI have overcome my social phobia to a great degree, but I know realize I have a deep fear of academic and professional evaluation and failure, to the point that I withdraw from opportunities before I could even be 'judged'. This has led to a very unfulfilling and disappointing professional and overall life. I feel time is ticking and I will regret my cowardliness (I already do).\n\nFor a reference, I am a 28M with bipolar type 2, so constant episodes of depression, and basal anxiety. Lately I've been a little suicidal again, no plan of acting on it. I do have now a happy relationship of 3+ years, and still live with my dad (mom passed away 10 years ago). I go to therapy and take the corresponding meds.",

            "comment": "Fear is there and it can feel strong but you are the one who actually makes decisions and controls your body. It doesn't need to be absent to live a full life. When you make a decision based on fear you avoid the consequences you were afraid of, which never come to pass. They possibly wouldn't have. What's the point of that? It's like being really hungry and letting that feeling of hunger influence you into not eating. Even though that strong feeling is there you are still capable of eating. Hunger is a more useful feeling though. Fear isn't reliable and isn't connected directly to reality. Let's say strong feelings of fear will always be present for you no matter what. Okay, that's just an aspect of life to navigate. Your desires and choices remain the same. Avoiding it won't stop it. Doing what you want possibly won't stop it. So you might as well operate as if it isn't a meaningful factor in your life (which it isn't really).",

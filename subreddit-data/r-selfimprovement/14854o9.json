His newer stuff is more iffy and from what I've seen radical but yes, if you follow his advice, you can definitely make improvements for yourself, even if you don't completely align with his alpha male style.",

There's only so much self improvement content possible to make, so once you have seen the fundamentals just implement them.\n\nHamza has approachable content, however I much prefer Natural Hypertrophy these days.",

    "postText": "I find that I am obsessed with doing things perfectly, but, that can lead to problems for my self improvement and general well-being.\n\nThe first problem would be in starting things. I've spent months and even years planning some things meticulously. Carefully accounting for every possibility and working on solutions to possible problems.\n\nThe second problem is my eventual failure. When I fail to achieve perfection I become depressed. When I don't come anywhere near perfection (much more often the case) my self hatred grows worse. I never feel I tried hard enough to achieve my goals. This is often right, which makes me feel even more anger towards myself.\n\nThis cycle of perpetual overplanning and failure leads to a constant anxiety and self hatred, which both ultimately contribute to me getting less accomplished. Which ultimately increases my self hatred and disdain.\n\nThe obvious solution here is to not strive for perfection. But, that is what is always in the back of my mind. I can \"turn it off\" but I'll always have the thoughts in the back of my mind saying, \"This is our actual goal. Here is actual perfection to aim for\".",

Some things are simply out of your hands and therefore flawed in your perception. However, letting these things get you down will only make things even more uncontrollable and flawed. It's a self-feeding pit I imagine. You can only perform your best, not perform perfectly. because that is just subjective to begin with. \n\nletting these things get in your way will simply degrade your mental cognizant and ultimately detriment your ability to perform at your peak. Take all this with a grain of salt. I don't know your past or if you have a diagnosed Condition. But don't be fooled into thinking you do. Sometimes it could a traumatic experience or a self defense mechanism. Hope this helps at least a little.",

            "comment": "I can empathize as I too am a perfectionist. It's taken me years to understand why I am this way and it has helped me relax the need to be perfect. For me it was due to being raised by a narcissistic mother. Nothing I really did seemed \"good enough\" to really please her and I was constantly walking on egg shells in order to not upset her. In order for me to get any kind of real praise I felt I needed to be the best of the best at whatever I was doing. When inevitably did not achieve perfection it caused much anxiety and depression.\n\nAnyway, this is a very precarious way to live life. I am in my late 30s now and can see how I was able to pull it off in my younger years but as I aged and did new things with new people it became untenable.\n\nThe key is to recognize when good enough is good enough and let things be a move on.\n\n\"The enemy of good is perfect\" -Voltaire",

A thing that I\u2019ve tried to harness that drive in myself is to remind myself early in the planning that I will get the dopamine sooner if I avoid letting perfect stand in the way of good especially during the planning part. Shorter easier to read and achieve steps from a helicopter view, and let the details come to you , rather than chase them out first.     -source: am a Manufacturing/Process Engineer.

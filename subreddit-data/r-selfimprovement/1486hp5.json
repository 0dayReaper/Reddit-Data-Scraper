    "postText": "I'm going to try my best to explain my situation. Im in my early twenties and suffered some intense trauma from 17-20. I live a high-stress life in an urban environment and my mind always races with ideas, tasks, thoughts... I'm never truly at peace. I am diagnosed ADHD , Anxiety , depression... and I take meds for depression (low dose) got prescribed adhd meds but never took them.   \nStudying Computer Science at University I do most of my work on the computer but my relationship with my computer is awful. It has become a source of enormous context switching, procrastination and terrible habits. Id estimate Im \"working\" 10% of the time I'm on this damn thing, and my focus is awful .   \nWorst of all over the past year or two I have developed this aversion to thinking deeply and solving problems (math, computer science) , etc... and ALWAYS look for the easy way out, and almost always succeed / get away with it. I am not proud of this and want to change this. Ive also noticed I now \"want to want things\" way too often, more specifically I \"want to want\" X task that is appealing in my mind / social environment.  \nI desperately want to change all this and get back to being my genuine, thoughtful self. This is a bad road I'm going down. ",

            "comment": "For one, ADHD isn't a bad thing. It is when it's not controlled of course but when harnessed it is a powerful tool. The meds to 'fix' it ultimately are a temporary fix and requires no SELF DISCIPLINE. same with anxiety and depression. Now, idk what your goals and aspiration are but ask yourself. Is this something I really want? Or is it something I think will fix my problems? If it's the latter, you're likely wrong. Everything you need to help yourself is already within you. And nothing out there will fix it. Not money, not a good job, not even a family will help you if cannot help yourself first. Hope this helps and doesn't sound like some generic response.  I've always avoided medication despite suffering from depression. It's a tough battle. But I want it to be tough. Not easy.",

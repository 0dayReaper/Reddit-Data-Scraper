Already forgot two of them since they were a few years ago.\n\nCurrently have another four books in the queue. A few days ago I ony had two books in the queue. I am afraid this will become 5 or 6 or 7 in a few weeks. \n\nI know its insanity but I cant seem to stop myself. I wonder if someone else has this issue too.\n\nHow do I stop \"Just one more\"?",

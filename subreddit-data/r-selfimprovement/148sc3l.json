    "postText": "Hey guys, I've been struggling with time management lately, finding that I often accomplish only a fraction of what I actually need to get done each day. Also, I have this bad habit of putting off tasks for MONTHS. I've been trying to discipline myself and I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights you have on mastering time management and making it a consistent part of my routine. Like making a habit out of it. And oh! I'm a freelance writer so I work from home.",

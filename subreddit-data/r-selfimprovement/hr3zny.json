I understand and appreciate that you want to get better but relying on random strangers online to do something is never going to work.\n\nThe only way to get something done and develop the discipline to do it comes from YOU. Stop asking for upvotes to help you. Help yourself. Get inspiration from others on the journey to self improvement. Stop relying on numbers to motivate you.",

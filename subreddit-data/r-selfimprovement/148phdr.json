    "postText": "A short summary- I experienced a lot of trauma and negativity in high school that affected me socially into adulthood (as I'm sure many have also experienced). I'm a 25 year old female and have a very difficult time connecting with people on a deeper level in person; I am friendly but have a very hard time letting my guard down. \n\nI'm just looking for someone genuine to talk to who may feel the same so I can can improve my conversation skills and form a friendship. If you're out there, doing it all on your own and need to get out of your own head, I feel like we could help each other shift into the next chapter. Thank you :)",

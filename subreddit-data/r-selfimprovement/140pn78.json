Lately I have not really been doing much. My daily routine consist of waking up around 10am, reading, tanning, watching tv, working out, reading again, then smoking some weed and finishing off the night with some 2k and going to bed at around 12-2. As you can see I am not really doing much throughout the day socially or physically, I am not sad nor upset with this lifestyle, I am quite happy and at peace. But I feel something is missing, and I feel like i\u2019m being a bum. I was wondering is there anything to help with this? or is there anything I can do to make me feel \nmore whole?",

It's all about finding what excites you and gives you a sense of purpose.\r  \n\r  \nOh, and if you want some extra motivation and accountability, you could give the Forfeit app a shot. It's not an ad or anything, just a suggestion. You set tasks for yourself and send evidence of completing them or lose money. It can help add some structure to your day and keep you on track.",

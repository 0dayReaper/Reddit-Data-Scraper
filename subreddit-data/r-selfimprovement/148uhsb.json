    "postText": "Today a good friend of mine told me that the biggest reason I have trouble with relationships is that I'm awkward. Now, before anyone says anything I *did* ask her what she thought was my biggest issue (other than physical things, those I'm working on what I can) when it comes to that.\n\nWe've basically known each other since we were kids so, I trust her judgement on this. She's also not the first person to say that so. As with everything I think is an issue, I'm gonna try to fix it but just don't really know where to start.",

Read How to Win Friends and influence People - there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s a classic.\n\nAlso, find your \u201ctribe\u201d, if you\u2019re passionate about something, surround yourself with others who are passionate about that same thing.  Growing up I was \u201cawkward\u201d, but then I found people who were into a lot of the same things I was and suddenly that same thing that made me awkward was my superpower",

Lots of ways to be awkward. \n\nBut as a baseline, a lot of what we are saying when we say something is awkward, is that it is imbalanced, or not clear and succinct in its representation of itself. \n\nI'm gonna assume that internally you might feel unsure of your role in more than one type of social instance. \n\nSome people are awkward around the opposite sex. \n\nSome people are completely cool around family, then they are awkward around everyone outside of their family.\n\n Some people are awkward around old people, but are totally cool with young people. \n\nIt all comes down to what social dynamics you have and haven't made peace with.\n\nThe only way to tell where you are being awkward is by feeling into yourself and noticing when you feel 'uncertain' in those contexts. \n\nLearn to find certainty and purpose in whichever areas you feel uncertain in and that will technically solve the issue. But it's not easy quick fix stuff. You are gonna be working on this 'not being awkward thing' your whole life. That's the fun in life. figuring out how to be more integrated in your life. \n\nNow get out there and have fun doing it. Like I said, this is a marathon, not a sprint.",

Then you will be in a better position on how to improve your situation.\n\nNo matter how awkward you think you are or were, you aren't.  No one is thinking about you very much at all... no one is probably thinking about you being awkward at all.  They are thinking about themselves, much like you are.  So, don't worry so much.\n\nLife is good... your life is good.",

So I try to express myself in my talents and interests as to get to know people and for people to try and get to know me. Mainly, for me, would be books and writing. Haven't attempted to make friends yet but I hope to find my group who understands me. I wish you luck too.",

    "postText": "I constantly have to be doing something. Listening to music, listening to a podcast, mindlessly scrolling through Twitter, watch a show or else I feel like I\u2019m going crazy. It has gotten even worse to the point that I now have to do two things at once or it\u2019s not enough stimulation. For example, mindlessly playing candy crush while watching TV. I can\u2019t sit down and read a book or write or even clean without feeling rushed bc I constantly feel like I need some sort of stimulation and if I don\u2019t I feel like I\u2019m going to start feeling out of control or something. Does anyone else experience this? Do you have any tips for combatting this bc it\u2019s started to reck havoc on my life.",

Probably not the answer everyone is most leanin too either. Staying active and challenging your body's muscles with challenges, when you do this.  It'll like calm your mind as well as body.",

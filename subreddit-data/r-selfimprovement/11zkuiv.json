    "postText": "I live with my parents but they hardly pay for food, clothes, or anything besides the apartment we will live in. I payed for my own car and have been working since i turned 16 but i still managed to save $22,000. When my first ever paycheck hit, I blew it in a few days, and had bad habits and wasted a lot of money, even if it was just a couple hundred dollars for my first few checks. I changed my spending and was able to put away almost all of my paychecks into savings minus food and gas and all that stuff. I can\u2019t tell anyone in my life like my parents who would try to make me pay even more, or my friends who either don\u2019t work or just spend their whole paycheck and would be jealous. I\u2019m just proud of myself and want other people to know what I have been able to accomplish without tearing me down for it.",

I've tried mint and nerdwallet but rocket is my favorite of the three. \n\nAs a 35yo, I'm impressed and happy to hear younger people being money conscience. Because it's true that when you get older, you'll have a few -i wish I listened to my parents- moments. (In general of course - the main point is  money management is so important to learn at that age). You'll both do well and whomever decides to be disciplined like this will too. Good luck!",

Like a $20 shirt doesn\u2019t seem like much but if it\u2019s not worth it to me to work for more than an hour of time for it, then I won\u2019t buy it. It helps me keep perspective and prevents buying things I don\u2019t actually need. \n\nFor saving, when I get my paycheck, I immediately put 30% into savings. Since my expenses are still limited at the moment, that works for me but any percentage works. After that, any time I spend money, I will take any change left in my account and move it to savings. Like if I buy something and the remaining balance in my checking account is $72.65, I will transfer the .65c to my savings for an even $72. That might be a little obsessive but I\u2019m constantly looking at my bank account throughout the day and it takes like 10 seconds on the app. To me it makes more sense to see an even balance to know how much I have, plus I\u2019m constantly adding to savings even when buying essential things, and it\u2019s not a strain to lose out on &lt;$1 per purchase.\n\nI might have gone to the opposite side of the spending scale and am now frugal and can hardly bring myself to spend money on things that aren\u2019t legitimate needs, and sometimes even that\u2019s hard. Now I\u2019m just trying to find a balance between being smart with my money and still being able to occasionally spend it on frivolous wants or fun things.",

They basically almost never spent a dime and was able to live off of their parents for everything and probably even had their parents pay for stuff outside of necessities. Appearently, though, they pay for every necessity on their own and pay their parents for some reason because they said they'll have to pay their parents \"even more.\" They're even paying for their car and groceries. Starting work at 16, which is a guess as most people don't, and even if they did the chances of full time are very slim, they basically saved up a whole year's worth of work in two years. Even at $15 a hour, which most 16 year olds won't make, that's around $27k after tax a year before spending a penny on anything. No one can live on their own and put away $22k in two years soley from their job unless they're making around $50k a year and being frugal. Especially when you calculate having to pay your own insurances, phone bill, possibly credit cards, rent, etc. A lot of early-mid 20 year olds aren't making that. Shit, quite a few 30 year olds aren't even making that. This really just seems like a fiction post, especially considering this account made like 8 comments and then went dormant for a year until they made this post.\n\nLegit, the only surefire good advice is to budget to your means and job hop as needed. It helps to have a valuable trade skill or a degree.",

Most people who start working at 16 won't even make $22k in 2 years, let alone save that much. \n\nIf you make minimum wage and work full time, 40 hours a week, you'd make $30k in 2 years, pre-tax. But doesn't this dude have school??\n\nMost student schedules are 5 hour shifts, 5 days a week. In fact, in many states, that's the maximum underage students are allowed to work. At least in my state, minors cannot work past 10pm. \n\nI want to say 25 hours a week but I'll be generous and say 30. At minimum wage, that's $11,000 per year. So this dude never spent a single penny in 2 years? He even outright says that's not true. So if he made minimum wage, it simply isn't possible for his numbers to be correct. \n\nIf he made $10/hr, his yearly salary is still less than $16k. So in this scenario, he pays for most of his living expenses, pays his parents, bought a car, but still only spent $9,000 in 2 years? \n\nIt sounds like straight bullshit unless someone hired a fucking 16 year old at $15-$20/hour",

You make contributions with pre-tax money from your paycheck. Unless your work offers Roth 401K then I\u2019d prefer that to maximize tax free withdrawals at retirement. \n\nI would focus less on contributing to 401K now unless you get an employer match. I\u2019d focus on growing a roth IRA until you get the match from an employer.",

                            "comment": "A 401k is an employer-sponsored retirement account, so unless your current employer offers 401Ks you probably wouldn\u2019t be starting one soon. If they do, yes, do that. It allows an employee to dedicate a percentage of their pre-tax salary to a retirement account. These funds are invested in a range of vehicles like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and cash. A set percentage the employee chooses is automatically taken out of each paycheck and invested in a 401k account. Financial experts recommend contributing the maximum amount each year, or as close to it as you can manage.\n\nMany employers offer to match employee contributions, either dollar for dollar or 50 cents to the dollar, up to a set limit. So, for example, say you make $100,000 a year and your employer offers a 401k matching of 50% up to the first 6% you elect to contribute. If you contribute 6% of your annual earnings ($6,000), your employer would contribute an additional 50% of that amount. So, 3,000 free dollars. 401Ks are also pre-tax accounts. This means the money is taken out before you pay taxes on it. You don\u2019t have to pay taxes on it until you use it in your retirement.\n\nIt's up to your employer to decide what percentage they will match, but many companies do offer a dollar-for-dollar match. If you are offered a job with a 401K and the employer does not match contributions... try to find a better job. An employer who doesn't match 401K contributions isn't a very good employer.\nMake sure you actually vest your 401K contributions. This means that you invest in stocks and bonds using the money in your 401K so it will grow. A lot of people put their money in a 401K, never vest it, and then it just sits there and grows 0% each year. We'll talk about smart ways to invest during the presentation on the stock market.\n \n**As for accounts you can start on your own**, you can either choose a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. \n\n**Traditional IRA**\n\nTraditional IRA contributions are tax-deductible on both state and federal tax returns for the year you make the contribution. That means you do not pay taxes as you add to the traditional IRA when you're working. Once you hit retirement, withdrawals, which are officially known as distributions, are taxed at your income tax rate. So, just like a 401K, you pay no taxes when you're building up your IRA, but instead pay taxes once you use it in retirement.\n\nContributions to traditional IRAs generally lower your taxable income in the contribution year. That lowers your adjusted gross income, possibly helping you qualify for other tax incentives you wouldn\u2019t otherwise get, such as the child tax credit or the student loan interest deduction.\n\nIf you withdraw money from a traditional IRA before age 591\u20442, you\u2019ll pay taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty. You can avoid the penalty (but not the taxes) in some specialized circumstances like when you use the money to pay for qualified first-time homebuyer expenses (up to $10,000) or qualified college expenses. Permanent medical disabilities and certain medical expenses may also be exempt from the penalty but you\u2019ll still pay taxes on the distribution.\nUnlike a 401K, employers do not match contributions to an IRA. Lots of people have both a 401K and an IRA. There are limits to how much you can contribute each year to them, so having both means you can build up a larger amount for your retirement.\n\n**Roth IRA**\n\nYou don\u2019t get a tax deduction when you make a contribution to a Roth IRA. This means it doesn't lower your AGI that year. But your withdrawals from your Roth IRA during retirement are tax-free. That's because you paid the tax bill upfront, so you don't owe anything on the back end.\n\nUnlike a traditional IRA, you do not have a minimum amount you have to withdraw in your retirement with a Roth IRA. Therefore, if you hit retirement and realize that you are totally set with just your 401K or pension, you can just let the money in your Roth IRA grow and then pass it on to your children or grandchildren once you die as an inheritance.\n\nOther than these two things, a Roth IRA is similar to a traditional IRA. Employers do not match contributions. Some of my teacher friends have Roth IRAs in addition to their pention so they can build up extra retirement.\n\n**One other thing** - if you have an HSA (health savings account), I recommend building that up, too. You can use it if you ever have a serious health concern you\u2019ll have money to cover it, and once you\u2019re retired you\u2019ll have money to cover major medical concerns. Lots of the elderly don\u2019t have any money set aside for health scares, but that\u2019s when we usually have the worst health and need to take care of ourselves the most!",

They used to say that you want 3 months\u2019 worth of expenses in your emergency fund but honestly, given what we all just went through with the pandemic and stuff I\u2019d recommend building it up to 6 months to a years\u2019 worth of salary so you have a solid cushion if you lose your job or something happens. \n\nI use Ally. Their savings account interest is 3.6%. You could also use a local credit union. You want a high interest rate so your savings earn money, but make sure it\u2019s a good bank lol. I\u2019ve had nothing but a good experience with Ally so far.",

But let's build on that! I know a lot about money and how money works. And I want to offer you some advice to go with a already good financial mind. Invest your money! Don't save any more then what you would need for three months worth of bills. Four months to be in the same side. I recommend investing into real estate over stocks or crypto and the reason for that is real estate is the only investment that has risen faster then inflation throughout history. \nThis might not be the best platform but I use Landa. And collect money passively every month. With your 22k in two years I'll bet you do just fine. Good luck to ya!",

You\u2019ll probably save like $10,000 a year depending where you live just by living with your parents.\nGood on you though. Invest a lot of it. Savings accounts interest are as high as they\u2019ve been in a really long time and CD\u2019s and stuff as well, so good timing for the safer investments",

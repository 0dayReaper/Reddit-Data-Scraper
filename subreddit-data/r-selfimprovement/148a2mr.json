    "postText": "So I just broke it off with my girlfriend because my insecurities got in the way and i couldn't be the person I wanted to be for her so I felt it was an idea (still don't know if it was a good one) to step away to fix my mental state before committing to anyone else. I was so Insecure that she would naturally fall in love with someone close to me and it broke me. (Not that she would cheat, she never gave any hint of that, but just slowly fall for someone close to me). I respect and hold my friends and family highly because they are all incredible people. I was always scared she would fall for someone who was funnier, smarter, etc. and I shut down. I told her these things not in an accusatory way but to be honest but I let it stir for months before I said anything and I let my self esteem tank in the process. Weirdly enough I think about it now and I have always had spurts of these feelings in friend groups before. This is messed up but I remember a friend of mine hanging with my brother instead of me and I felt terrible. I remember my brother being his funny unique self around my friends and seeing him in the forefront of attention and I got jealous. It passed but it was there. I love my brother to death and there's no animosity there but it's just an observation of a previous similar feeling. Also I had a massive punch in the gut to my career about a year ago, one I went to school for and now I'm kinda just lost not really sure what my future holds or what direction to go in professionally so that was also a massive blow to my self esteem which definitely doesn't help. I've always had these small bouts of jealousy before but with my ex girlfriend is where all this stuff compounded and I wrecked myself mentally. I'm seeing a therapist now working to get a better grasp on who I am and feel happy being me but damn I'm thinking maybe way more of my life has been based on some fragile foundation of needing acceptance from others.",

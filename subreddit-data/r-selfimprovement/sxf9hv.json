    "postText": "Hey there, thank you so much for clicking on the post. I just want to take 2 minutes out of your day so you can just read this post. I know how much of a bad day you\u2019re having, it\u2019s a normal day for you isn\u2019t it? You wake up in the morning and the first thing that comes to your mind is all the negative energy and thoughts from the night before. It\u2019s starting to turn into a routine, isn\u2019t it? \n\nI just want to remind you that we can all see how hard you\u2019re trying to battle this, how much you want to wake up in the morning and all of these thoughts could magically disappear, we can see it, we can sense it, we know, bud. I want to remind you that this is not how your life is going to pan out, you\u2019re not going to experience this feeling everyday, it will change, and it all starts with you. But, we know, you struggle to see the good in you, you truly believe that you\u2019re a terrible person and you don\u2019t deserve anything good to come to you, when in fact, it\u2019s the complete opposite. I fully believe that if someone goes out of their own way to try and improve on themselves, even when people are criticising or talking down to them, they deserve all the good in the world, and that\u2019s exactly what YOU deserve. In order to get to that position, don\u2019t allow the bad days overshadow you as a person, because deep down, you\u2019re incredibly strong, you\u2019re so motivated to do better, and be a better person. You don\u2019t need to look around you to see if anyone has seen a change in you, mentally and physically, because every single one of us here can. It\u2019s a scary feeling to admit that you need to change your life around, because at the end of the day, we all do, nobody is perfect and we all need help, no matter what shape or form. But, you, you\u2019ve come to the right place, because you\u2019re not going to see much better places than this particular place, why? Because we all have this 1 goal in life - to improve ourselves. You may want to improve yourself as a person, improve on your attitude, your judgements, your physique, mentally etc, you\u2019re in the right place, friend. \n\nWe support you. Every decision you make, we will be there for you. Yes, we will screw up in life, we will make terrible mistakes, we will do bad things, we will say the wrong things, but from where I stand, the reaction is more important than the mistake. Are you shamed? Afraid? Worried? Fearful? We are here for you, as long as we have a deal, you do good and improve yourself from everything you once done, and we will be there for you. Deal? \n\nDo good, help other people, support one another, this shouldn\u2019t be hard, it should be neural, we are all in the same place, let\u2019s build eachother up to greater things. We don\u2019t want you to suffer anymore, but it is easier said than done. If you feel as if you\u2019re having a weak moment, come here, share your thoughts, feelings and emotions and we\u2019ll be there for you, we will listen and turn in whenever you are ready. \n\nI just want to remind you that we are here for you, we care for you and we want the best for you, no matter the situation you\u2019re in. If you ever feel alone, give us a message, plead for some help, we will be there for you, bud, we will be there for you. \n\nNow that you\u2019ve taken your time to read this, I want to wish you a lovely day, wherever you are in the world, but that doesn\u2019t matter, we are all humans, we all have our troubles, and we are all there for eachother, day or night. You\u2019re trying to improve yourself everyday and I respect that so much from you, even though you feel as if you\u2019ve got a mountain to climb, you put yourself first and I appreciate that, I admire it. \n\nI respect you for being here, I respect you for doing good for others and for yourself. You and me, we are in this together, let\u2019s overcome the odds, let\u2019s improve ourselves, let the past in the past and let\u2019s strive for today, live in this moment. \n\nHave a great day, friend. And remember, you are so incredibly cared for.",

I spent most of the morning just wishing it wasn\u2019t this way and not understanding why I feel so often like I\u2019m trying so hard to make sure other people are okay and be their support when they can\u2019t support themselves. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a crutch way really where I\u2019m hindering them, but kinda the vibe of those posts that are like \u201cif you didn\u2019t get out of bed today and all you could do was exist, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re worth something still.\u201d Idk if that makes any sense, I just put what to me is a consistent, solid amount of effort fighting for other people not to fall in the hole. I really care about it and I\u2019m not looking for high praise or anything, but I wish anyone would listen to me or pay enough attention to notice that as I\u2019m doing my best to pull them up and away from falling into that hole, I\u2019m moving closer to my own behind me. I can\u2019t do it all. I really can\u2019t and I\u2019m very aware of the \u201cyou have to love yourself first\u201d stuff but if I\u2019m not there for some people I don\u2019t feel optimistic that they would stay here for long at all and if I can sacrifice part of myself to keep them around I have to try. \n\nI didn\u2019t mean for this to turn so dramatic, I feel like I sound like a wannabe anime main character meme acting like it\u2019s some heroic act to be there for people. But i so desperately want to feel seen. For someone to check on me because they can tell I could use help because they paid attention all on their own. I have work to do for sure and I expect I\u2019ll master it one day, I\u2019ve been way lower than this and I know I\u2019m not gonna ever give up and end shit or something. \n\nFucking hell. When I started typing all I wanted to say is I never feel anything with these types of posts because I know it\u2019s from a stranger who doesn\u2019t know I exist, but I actually felt this one a little and it helped me a little with feeling like someone cares. Even if it\u2019s a stranger talking to a group of strangers. Thank you for taking the time to type all that, this was the one good part of my day. I hope you also feel cared for and worthwhile.",

Thank you for making the world a little better and supporting others through hard times. \ud83d\udc96\n\nIt sounds like your feeling burnt out. Please listen to the signals from your body and mind that are telling you to take care of yourself. It's not selfish to take care of yourself. It's necessary. And I understand it's hard. I've also had times where I feel like I'm the only thing keeping someone I care about going. But you still gotta carve out time and space for yourself. You need and deserve self care and self love.\n\nFinally consider asking the people around you for a little support. I know, I know. It would feel sooooooooooooo much better if they just knew and helped without your asking. But they can't read your mind; you're probably projecting a lot of strength and solidity so how will anyone know you need help unless you let them know? And if you feel like they can't handle it? Remember that supporting others feels good. Give them a chance to support you back; it might be good for them too.\n\nMay you be happy. May you be well. May you find peace.\n\nEdit: corrected autocorrect.",

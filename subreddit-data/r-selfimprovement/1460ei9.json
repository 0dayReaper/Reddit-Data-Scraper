    "postText": " hi all,\n\n i\u2019m posting this here mostly to just lay out my journey. a month ago i broke up with my fianc\u00e9e and it hit me hard. i spiralled into a depression which saw me end up with suicidal tendencies. i decided one morning that i was either going to take my own life or i was going to try to get the help that i needed. i chose the latter. im not fixed and my mind still wanders in the direction of suicide but i have a support network, medication and therapy with 2 therapists who are focused on different areas of my path to healing. one is focused on CBT while the other is trauma focused and really getting into the finer points of my life, my childhood and the affects my upbringing had on who i am today. \n\nwhatever happened with my relationship, there was a time where i woke up and realised that this person made me see my downfalls and issues. she made me want to be a better person and i started the journey of bettering myself with my exes support. losing that was a huge knock on my not only my life but my motivation to go forward. but i am trying to go forward and i\u2019m trying to find it in myself to do so. she used to be proud of me for the changes i\u2019d make and even a friend of hers would comment on how open i was to accept my faults and build past them. so instead of relying on them for support, i\u2019m trying to remember those feelings and i\u2019m trying to build on it to use that to motivate me and so that i can maybe be proud of myself one day. \n\ni always wanted to run and so i\u2019ve started a C25K program which sees me on my 9th run today. that\u2019s one third of the way through the program and i\u2019m happy to be able to say i\u2019ve stuck with that this long. \n\ni\u2019m doing yoga with adriene on youtube. in many ways this is harder than the running i\u2019ve started - both mentally and physically, i was emotional after one session but i went back the next day. i also started a stretching program with anna mcnulty. to focus on more flexibility in my hips and legs - which is useful for the industry i\u2019m in. \n\nas well as those, i\u2019m working with resistance bands, workout programs for abs and to turn my asslessness into an ass. i\u2019m also meditating with the Balance app. \n\nif i make it to 5k, i want to run one in my kilt at some point and maybe try to raise money for a mental health charity. i\u2019ve thought about the possibility of doing this in england where i am just now, edinburgh (where i\u2019m from), ireland (where i spent most of my years), and germany so that i can create a memory of that area i broke up with my ex in that isn\u2019t one that breaks me. \n\ni\u2019m not happy with my life at all. i\u2019m not happy with where i am. i\u2019m not happy to see the future i dreamed of with my ex disappear. im tired of constantly having to restart my life from the ground up. i feel like i no longer have vision, plans or dreams, and i was always a dreamer. it\u2019s one day at a time and i struggle so much with that. i wake up to make it to bed again. the last few days have been horrid with those dark thoughts swimming around but i\u2019m trying to push through. \n\ni\u2019m trying to keep on going forward but i have so many ups and downs right now that it\u2019s hard. i\u2019ve made what can be called major life adjustments and that\u2019s what people tell me they are - it\u2019s just some days i feel as though those adjustments are just ways to avoid my thoughts. i sometimes wonder if i\u2019m doing it all for the right reasons. \n\neither way, in my future and since i started all of this physical activity, medication and therapy, i\u2019m being a better version of me and i want to one day be able to realise this and be proud of myself for making these changes. i want to be a better me so that one day i can be loved for being me and so that i can have someone hug me again because i miss that feeling the most of all. and on my down days it\u2019s the one thing i want more than anything. \n\ni don\u2019t want to feel down and numb forever so i\u2019m throwing all that i can at this to come out as a better version of me. i want to get through this.",

            "comment": "This is a period of reflection and development and from what I can tell from reading this, is that you have a lot of heart, and that is such a wonderful thing to hold onto. You won\u2019t be down and numb the rest of your life, because right now you are learning to love yourself. And that is where it all begins, it won\u2019t be an easy road, it wont, but the fact that everyday you realize that you have to keep going, is what makes you stronger, dare I say, resilient. Take your time, if you need to cry, let it out, it feels alot better to let out everything. You are in charge of your happiness and just know that you can definitely do it! I believe in you!!",

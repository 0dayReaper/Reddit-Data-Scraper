Staying in bed all day eating take outs and feeling sad because im wasting time but at the same time doing nothing about it.",

            "comment": "Unfortunately you're going to have to muster up the willpower and force yourself to do what you gotta do. Otherwise ask yourself if you are willing to accept the consequences of inaction. Not studying isn't just a conscious decision to not study, it is also consciously choosing the results of that action. Ask yourself if you are okay with making those choices and if you will be able to accept the person you'll become. Get angry at yourself and build up some fire in your belly to do what you should.",

Don't beat yourself up about it - we all go through rough patches. \rConsider using the Forfeit app as a way to hold yourself accountable. It's an app where you commit to completing tasks and risk losing a bit of money if you don't follow through. It can provide that extra incentive to get things done.\r Create a routine that includes self-care activities. Prioritize healthy habits like exercise, proper nutrition, and enough sleep. Taking care of yourself physically and mentally can improve your overall motivation and well-being.\r Remember, it's never too late to turn things around. Start small, stay consistent, and don't be too hard on yourself.",

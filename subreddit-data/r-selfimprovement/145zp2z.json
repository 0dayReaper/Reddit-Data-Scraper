    "postText": "Lately I\u2019ve been incredibly frustrated with myself. Just simple things like constantly being late for things because I try and leave far too late and then I\u2019m rushing, which ruins my state of mind. For example, if I have a train that leaves at 9am, I won\u2019t start panicking until 8:30 to get to the station, which is then far too late, or I\u2019ll be at a bus station on time, but literally miss the bus because I was looking at the wrong platform. This is starting to bleed into my work, where I make silly mistakes, forwarding emails to the wrong people, forgetting appointments, and generally missing deadlines, friends birthdays or important dates. It\u2019s getting really embarassing and hurtful for me, and I\u2019m really not sure where to start? In terms of trying to plan my day better, I\u2019m so shattered and tired by 10pm and the pain of planning consistently is so great that I just sleep, and the cycle repeats itself! Any advice would be so helpful!",

Keep in mind that you only have 16 hours a day (not including 8 hours of sleep). \n\nWhen planning your day, plan only the things you are 100% certain you can accomplish. And always keep in mind the time needed for traveling from one obligation to another.\n\nAt the beginning, I would say start small. Do a couple small obligations per day, that you know you can achieve without being late or unfocused. By that, you will start to build your confidence and self esteem. After you feel good, add one more obligation per day. And that's it, start small, build confidence, and keep upgrading until you are fully satisfied with yourself.",

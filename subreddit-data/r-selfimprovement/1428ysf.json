So I'm completely alone it's pretty crazy and scary but in the long run I'll find people who are on the same path as me. I hope and if any of you wanna be friends message me.",

If a friend is over competitive and flirts with everyone they see I\u2019ll hang out with them in settings where that won\u2019t be an issue.  \n\nMost people see friendships as transactional, like what do they do for me, but I\u2019d offer to only see people you want to help build up because of who they are. Friendship is about who we want to contribute to, not the other way around.",

It can be intimidating to be alone at first, but remember that this opens up opportunities to meet new people who align with your goals and values.\r  \n\r  \nTo find like-minded individuals, consider joining communities or groups centered around your interests or hobbies. This could be through local meetups, online forums, or social media groups. Engaging in activities you enjoy can also help you naturally connect with people who share similar passions.\n\nAnd an extra tip in case you lose the motivation is using the forfeit app. I started using it and it helps me a lot. I need to send an evidence completing a task, or i lose $10. I use it mainly to go to the gym but i can be used for everything.",

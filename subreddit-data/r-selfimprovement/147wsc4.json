            "comment": "First of all, CONGRATU-EFFIN-LATIONS!! Losing 650lbs seems unreal to me and the fact that you are now at a much healthier weight is amazing! I\u2019ve known a lot of people who had opted for gastric surgeries and still couldn\u2019t keep the weight off, what you managed to do is praise worthy and I am proud of you, OP! (But not as proud of you as your knees are now that they\u2019re not under as much stress, lol). If people don\u2019t see that as the amazing accomplishment that it really is, then there\u2019s something wrong with them.\n\nSecond, it sounds like the real problem was the people you\u2019re surrounded with all along. All I can say is that people are temporary. Throughout life, only the people that really matter tend to stick around, and that\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t know your situation but:\n\n-\tIf you\u2019re a kid, then trust me this is all so very temporary and I think planning a future in a different city/town would so you good.\n-\tIf you\u2019re an adult and you live in a small town, I would think about moving if you can afford it.\n-\tif you\u2019re an adult in a decent sized city, I would start looking into making some new friends and distancing myself from the morons in your life. It\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s doable in most cases. Hell, you can even think about moving if you can afford it.\n\nThe bottom line is that this problem isn\u2019t about your body, it\u2019s about the massive grade-A assholes that are surrounding you. And we do get a say in who we choose to let surround us.\n\nBut seriously, congratulations that\u2019s a massive achievement!",

You should be proud of yourself. Even having the surgery, it is still not that easy. I am sure you know this.  It's no magic wand for sure. I am a nurse who has worked with gastric bypass surgery patients and know their struggles. You still have to do some exercise like walking or mild weight lifting type exercises. You sometimes get cravings too, after you have the surgery. Having to fight cravings makes it hard too. You made the smart choice to lose weight surgically. Ignore those people-they are just jealous haters. Now you can make new friends-healthier friends. Aloha from Hawaii!",

Yeah pretty big achievement, but if you only managed that with surgery, you might not have the will to prevent regaining the weights. I don't know much about overweight things since i was a skinny person then and never been fat. But i can say, even if you don't have any diet, you probably should be doing exercises. If You spend less calories than you consume, you'll regain the weight. Same for me, if I'd stop working out, i would turn into the same skeleton guy in just 5 months. You don't have to be in diet. Just eat as much as you want but be sure you don't keep those calories in your body.

I\u2019m sure you have heard the phrase \u201cHaters are gonna hate.\u201d And this applies to you too. You may not believe this but I\u2019d like you to really think about it. This is not a you problem. This is a THEM problem. You are minding your own businesses, doing your own thing, taking care of yourself\u2026so why do they care? Why would anyone feel the need to just come in and shit on you? Envy. Something you have or have done they are comparing to their own failures. They are minimizing your work and effort in attempt to compartmentalize your accomplishments as \u201cless than\u201d their own failed efforts. And they are doing it to feel better about themselves. Next time someone makes a comment like that? Ask them why they\u2019re so interested in someone else\u2019s body. That it\u2019s creepy that they\u2019re SO invested and tell them you are gonna go ahead and just leave. And do it. Leave. Make them sit and think about the fact that you think they are some kind of weirdo. The other option is to cut them out completely. When I lost weight I was extremely hurt by the jokes and comments my \u201cfriends\u201d made. Some examples are: starving myself, don\u2019t ask her she stuck on some no sugar kick, I liked you better before\u2026I can\u2019t even remember them all\u2026all kinds of just funky comments. I ditched them and built stronger relationships with the people who didn\u2019t see any need to remark about my body at all. You have fought a long and had battle. Do not let people who sat on the sidelines ruin your victory for you. You matter, you are worthwhile, and you deserve to be happy. Put them in their place or ditch them.",

How do you feel after losing so much weight?\n\nSecond, I have to say that the people ridiculing you are a bunch of absolute idiots. I don't think that hard work would get you anywhere being that much overweight. On the contrary, I think that it would be very difficult if not dangerous. So in my opinion, the surgery was the way to go and it was perfectly fine to undergo it in your case.\n\nYou shouldn't feel bad about it. You had a severe health issue and in my country I'd rather have my health insurance contribution spent on helping an obese person than a smoker or a drunkard, for example.",

I def have seen this opinion out in the world, and its stupid because your stomach is smaller but the things that propell a person to become obese to the level of needing surgical intervention, that is not an issue with the size of the persons stomach. It's more a cognitive/psychological hurdle that still has to be overcome and powered over the only way possible. Discipline, persistence, dedication, and all those other traits I definitely dont possess, at least not to the degree you seem to undoubtedly have some badass qualities about you because that amount of weight loss is aspirational, inspiring and impressive even if you had someone controlling every bite you eat, had a machine that you could strap yourself into that did your workouts for you with little to no effort on your part, and got paid like $5 per pound lost. Like  my God, I'm excited about my weight loss (I am also on metformin which has made it easier to break harmful habits) but it pales in comparison to the obvious strength you have. Seriously, like how the hell?  I'm like.  .. \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f anything, in my mind, around the 50 pound mark is AMAZING and people should be SO PROUD of themselves.

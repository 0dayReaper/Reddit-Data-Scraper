    "postText": "\nMy father in-law has a few days until death, due to a severe cancer. My sister inlaw flew from across the country to see her father before death for a couple days, but left early because brother inlaw is unless and can\u2019t take care of his children by himself. \n\nAm I crazy to think the sister inlaw is selfish for not sticking around until he passes ? And the brother inlaw is a jerk for not seeing him at all? He hasn\u2019t seen him in 3 years. Never will again. Never made the effort to say goodbye. Is this normal?\n\nThe sister inlaw and brother inlaw were always looked upon as the gold standard.",

            "comment": "There are a lot of factors that I think would kind of determine whether or not what they did was selfish. For the sister-in-law, how needed was she to take care of the kids? If the brother-in-law was genuinely so incompetent that he quite literally couldn't take care of some kids so a few days, I wouldn't be so harsh on the sister-in-law. She still made the effort to come, but couldn't stay because her kids needed her. If that is the case I would definitely call the brother-in-law selfish. The fact that he never learned how to care for his own kids is pathetic, and I dare say somewhat selfish. And about coming down to see your father-in-law, there are some points you should take into consideration. Do they have enough money for him to fly over? Who would take care of the kids if he went? Would they come with them, and if so, where would they stay? And would they have enough money for all that? Try to look at the situation from their points of view as much as you can and try to figure out what their thought process for making those decisions might have been before you make rash judgments.",

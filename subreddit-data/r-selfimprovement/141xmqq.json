I hate myself for doing it to them, and I hate myself for not knowing how to fix it. My therapist told me the solution was to just text people, but I can\u2019t. I get in a depressed slump and I can\u2019t even bring myself to get out of bed, let alone communicate. I\u2019m working on the depression, but I still struggle texting people back on time. How can I fix this? I can\u2019t keep hurting them.",

Have you ever felt like a relationship was satisfying or are you perpetually feeling disappointment or rejection? Is your isolation a way for you to control the situation? \n\nNegativity breeds more negativity, so take a few moments each day to find ANYTHING to be grateful, even if doing this at first feels like a lie. Filling your cup up will allow your social battery to fill up. \n\nIf your experiencing social anxiety, take some time to find a podcast or simply test your fear by putting yourself into situations to get better at communicating your authentic expression.",

Look back into your childhood and see when these began, where did this first take place? With a parent that was highly judgment where you felt you could never please? Or an overly criticizing figure causing you to feel judged around others (a teammate, brother, uncle, dad, mom, sister). If you\u2019re feeling disappointment, take a few moments to ask yourself what situation might be causing it? Did they do something particular? Are you holding a grudge? \n\nJust good baselines for you to go by. The idea with developing your coping skill arsenal is to find magazine fits your machine best. It\u2019s not one size fits all, but you can find methods that are better than others. \n\nSelf isolation isn\u2019t bad especially if you don\u2019t actively feel safe in a relationship dynamic. Sometimes it happens that we experience insecure attachment with others where simply controlling the relationship by holding others at arms distance or feeling it would end you if the person left are all behaviors to notice. \n\nIn my opinion, Security happens when you feel safe with another, despite how they might feel or think, knowing that they are thinking about your best interests, alongside their own and you are in turn doing the same.",

That\u2019s not a helpful suggestion at all, definitely not any way to address the underlying cause, and it sounds like it probably makes you feel worse about it. I don\u2019t know your past treatments, but if you aren\u2019t currently, maybe look into CBT or DBT? It\u2019s helped me a lot with re-framing negative thoughts and feelings about depression and self worth. \n  For some, myself included, communication can be really exhausting sometimes. If I\u2019m already depressed or stressed out, I don\u2019t talk much, if at all. And that\u2019s okay! Your body and subconscious are telling you that you have a need that is not being met.\n   A friend I worked with struggled with this too, and she had a note saved in her phone to send to people when she couldn\u2019t find the emotional energy to communicate. It basically said she was sorry, but she\u2019s not in a good place right now, and it takes a lot for her to be present and communicate, but she needs to focus her energy on feeling better, she would reach out when she\u2019s feeling like herself again, and she loved you. \n  I really appreciated her just telling me what was up, and also setting that boundary so I knew how to respect her needs and I could tell her that I\u2019m here if she needed anything, and I\u2019d be holding space for her. That helped me a lot as a friend knowing she needed space, she wasn\u2019t ghosting me. If you want, I can write a short message for you if that would be helpful? \n  I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re not feeling like yourself right now.

            "comment": "I feel with you there. I mean, I personally tend to ghost people and not respond when I'm having trouble coming up with something to say or how to say it... and the longer I take to respond the harder it gets.\n\nI feel shit about it, but that only adds to the emotional baggage weighing me down when I even think about responding...\n\nTo your therapist's credit, sometimes there is no way but to go through and just rip the bandaid off. In the few instances I've managed so far, people have been far kinder than I'd ever thought to imagine.. but maaan, can it be hard to get to that point and getting into the right headspace to actually do it. When I had trouble applying for jobs and my therapist told me to just, apply, I too was like: \"No shit Sherlock, why do you think I'm here? If that's all I needed to hear to do it, literally any of the people around me who've told me this before would have sufficed.\"\n\nBut, just to spill my metaphorical bag of nuggets of wisdom I've collected on the table for you to sift through, in the hopes you'll find something that suits your needs or might help inspire a shift in perspective, here's what I've learned so far:\n\n(1) \"I care about this person more than I fear their potentially negative reaction to what I'm going to say.\"\n-&gt; Learned this one through Covid, whenever I had to inform people who'd I'd just seen the day before that I've been feeling sick the next day. I get very scared of people getting angry with me, and it helped me to find something that would be worth  exposing myself to that risk, that is more valuable than that to me. In this case, I cared more about the person's well-being then them potentially getting angry with me. \n\n\nAlso can help with setting boundaries \"Hey, this person overstepped a boundary here, and if I don't tell them, who knows if someone else will. And I would hate for them to overstep this boundary with so. else and getting shunned for in, while they are unaware of what they did wrong.\"\n\n\n(2) Personally, I find it to be easier to talk to a person in cases like this, whether it's over phone or in person. I play a lot of D&amp;D, so I've grown to become more comfortable in improv settings, and I like being able to work with the tone of my voice to convey what I might be unable to put into words. Also helps that you get more immediate feedback instead of having to wait for a response and being able to see the emotional reaction of the person as well instead of having to infer over text how they might have meant what they've written.\n\n\n(3) taking your time, maybe sit down and write some notes of what you want to say to them. It can help to break up the process of replying to make it less scary for yourself instead of trying to do it all at once. Just think about the next step you can go, the next thing you can write. And, I'd say it's generally more appropriate to write a longer message in these situations as well, as it shows that you've put quite a lot of thought into this, and are taking your time to reply and chosing your words carefully.\n\n\n(4) and if you do reply via text message, grab yourself a blanket, some stuffed animals, chocolate - whatever you need to sooth yourself - and prepare for the emotional backlash of hitting that 'Send' button. I personally tend to jump into bed and hide under my blanket and just freak out for a few moments and then try to distract myself until I get a reply ^^;\n\nThink that's all i cen think of for the moment, I hope there's something useful for you in there :)",

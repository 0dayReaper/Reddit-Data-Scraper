    "postText": "When we think of relationships, we usually think of other people: family, friends, partners, co-workers, that f\\*cker that keeps playing the organ at midnight next door, the dog, etc.\n\nRelationships are super duper important to living at least a somewhat decent life. I doubt many people will disagree.\n\nYet the most important relationship is the one that is commonly most overlooked:\n\nYour relationship with yourself!\n\n# Your relationship with yourself\n\nDon't worry, I'm not going to come out with some hoo-hah \"love yourself\" bullshit. I promise.\n\nNot long ago there was only one person I hated in life. One person that I thought was the most pathetic, weak, lacking, and bruh-inducing human that I knew. And who was that?\n\nMe!\n\nWas thinking this healthy? No. Did it benefit me in any way? No. Did it benefit others? No. Was it conducive to my goals? No. Did it make me feel any better? No.\n\nBut my past depressed self made this a reality. Whether it was true or not, I believed it, so it became true to me.\n\nMy past self rationalised this thought pattern. I made it appear reasonable to talk to myself like this - to have this I'm-such-a-loser-all-I-do-is-lose internal dialogue. Compared to so many people around me, I felt behind in life. *Really* behind.\n\nMy mental health was in a laughable state. I was physically as fit as my 70yr old neighbour (the one that plays that f\\*cking organ), lonely, depressed, hopeless, and didn't have much going for me. And to put the cherry on top, I habitually played the comparison game with people online.\n\nNow that *is* a loser's game.\n\nAfter a while, I'd had enough. I said, \"f\\*ck this, I'm sick of myself for hating myself, and I've got to do something about this\". I took the plunge into rekindling my relationship with myself.\n\n**Why Is This Important?**\n\nIf your goal is improvement, you must be someone that **wants** to improve.\n\nWhen I treated myself like a foe:\n\n* I kept regressing to old standards after a very short time.\n* I had no motivation to improve and achieve worthwhile goals.\n* I quickly gave up on anything that took effort.\n* I overindulged in vices and bad habits.\n* And I just didn't care much if I won or lost.\n\nAnd other people are going to notice this. It is reflected in everything: posture, work ethic, body language, etc. You will never be able to subconsciously rationalise improving someone you hate.\n\nAnd to add, not many people will want to be around you either.\n\nTo try to be a better person yet speak to yourself as a problem is counter-intuitive. Don't you think? It's bound to create a form of mental incongruence. And as long as your actions for yourself do not align with your thoughts about yourself, you will always feel a kind of dissonance. And this shit isn't what we want.\n\n**Oh wow, this is cool and all, but how tf do I start liking myself a little more?**\n\nFirstly, you've got to be aware of the problem. How do you speak to yourself regularly? Like you would to a friend? How about when you do something well or badly?\n\nStart to develop a perception of your thoughts about yourself more and assess them. This could be some of the most beneficial introspection you do. Take note of how much is positive and how much is negative. And don't just skip this shit - it's important.\n\nFor example, here were some of mine that used to be all too common: \"I'm pathetic\", \"I'm stupid\", \"I'm weak\", \"I'm a sorry excuse for a man\", \"Why would anyone ever like me?\", and \"Why should *I* bother?\"\n\nPretty rough, huh?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext, you have to *want* to become someone that you like.\n\nPerhaps you don't want to. Perhaps this seems a bit lovey-dovey.\n\nMake no mistake, I'm not saying you should love yourself all of a sudden. That obviously won't work. Not a single cringe \"love yourself\" affirmation or quote changed shit when I was a doomer.\n\nIf you're suffering right now, why should you love the person who's put you there? It's more about thinking positively and reshaping your identity so it aligns with your goals.\n\nYou should find a nice balance between loving and hating yourself - too much hate, and you'll never get shit done; too much love and you'll get too comfortable with where you currently are.\n\nYour beliefs should be as self-serving as possible. Ones that aren't will compound and weaken your mind. Because ultimately, your beliefs become your reality.\n\nHere are some next steps you can take:\n\n1. Only compare yourself to yourself. Easier said than done, I know. But it's a biggie. Deleting - or at least distancing - yourself from social media will help. All these \"successful\" nerds will make everything you do seem futile. Instead, compare your progress to where you were in the past.\n2. Look after yourself. But take it gradually, step by step. Overwhelming yourself will cause a reset, or prevent you from starting altogether. Do some simple things: take a shower, drink some water, meditate for 2 minutes, journal 1 thing you're grateful for, go for a walk, etc. Do these little things, let them compound, and see how you feel after a week or two.\n3. Envision the person you want to become - the dream version of yourself. How would they treat and speak to themselves? Really use your imagination and paint as vivid a picture as possible. The more detail, the more emotion you can tie to it, and the more powerful it will be. Now act and think in alignment with how they would.\n4. Intercept negative thoughts and replace them with positive ones. Unfortunately, emotions are addictive, so many people get stuck thinking negatively. This will take practice, but you can get there. One tip is to write a reminder on the wall to think good thoughts. The less tolerance you have for non-serving thoughts, the easier it will be.\n\n**The most important thing**\n\nThe one thing that gave me the most progress was changing my beliefs about myself. It seemed stupid to have beliefs about myself that made life harder.\n\nSo, I removed all tolerance for negative beliefs and replaced them with positive ones. I would constantly reaffirm these beliefs, no matter how arduous it seemed. This is some biohacking, neuroplasticity, and reprogramming your mind-type shit.\n\nI found results the most, however, when I **proved** these beliefs. That is the key. Because then you get a nice feedback loop and a positive memory to add credence to the belief.\n\nThe idea goes: Form a serving **belief** \\-&gt; **Act** in accordance -&gt; See the **Result** \\-&gt; Get mental **feedback**.\n\nThen the feedback either strengthens the belief or weakens it. It's these feedback loops that can be the difference between feeling on top of the world and like a fat sack of shit. This is why it's paramount that you understand this! These beliefs can make or break you.\n\nDon't worry if at first you don't act correctly or get the desired results. Remind yourself that you are evolving into the person who believes x about themselves, and with time it will come true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some concluding notes and stuff**\n\nSpeak to yourself like a friend. Behave how you would want your child to.\n\nThere is a lot more to cover on this topic, such as affirmations (which can help immensely but are almost always incorrectly done and misunderstood), identity and the ego, belief, victim mentality, feedback loops, etc. But I think these deserve their own posts.\n\nOne of the biggest determinants of success for most things in life is how much you believe in yourself. Be someone that you can believe in.\n\nLeave a comment and let me know what you think. Thx for reading.",

I've applied to over 60 jobs, and I've only got 3 interviews, all of which I was denied due to being overqualified. I can't apply to more qualified jobs, because there are none in my area. I can't afford to move because my job doesn't pay well, won't give me a raise, or promotion. Jobs out of state won't hire me, either.\n\nSimilarly, I'm a loser because women pay me no attention. I don't know where to meet women. I improve myself by going to the gym, joining Facebook groups, having hobbies, and going to events, but I still never meet anyone. So, then I just feel worse, because I'm taking the right steps, I'm a fit, attractive, intelligent man, but things still don't improve.",

Here are our not-so-secret steps.\r  \n\r  \n1.Master the Basics\r  \n\r  \nOn average, it takes about a year, plus another year of hands-on experience to nail the basic skills. After this, you might notice most basic courses start to sound like echoes. But this is where the fun part begins!\r  \n\r  \nWhere to get: Lectures, books, YouTube, podcasts, courses, articles, mentors, university - you name it.\r  \n\r  \n2. Diversify Your Study Field\r  \n\r  \nEver heard of cross-pollination in learning? You've got to venture beyond your specific study area. Get curious about related fields - it's a way to take your skills up a notch.\r  \n\r  \nWhere to get: Related topics + Colleagues\r  \n\r  \n3. Gain Insights From Other Fields\r  \n\r  \nThere's a sweet spot where observation turns into insight. It's like a knowledge goldmine. Look at works from fields related to, or even far from, yours. You'll be surprised at how this can spice up your professional toolkit.\r  \n\r  \nWhere to get: Other people's works from related fields. The farther the field, the more useful the knowledge.\r  \n\r  \n4. Your Work, Your Way\r  \n\r  \nNow, this is where you get to blend your personal passions with your work. Got an interest that's entirely separate from work? Why not bring that into play? It's a blank canvas for experimentation and might give you a unique spin on your skills.\r  \n\r  \nWhere to get: Hobbies, other areas of your interest.\r  \n\r  \n5. Try Mentorship\r  \n\r  \nIn the end, the best person who may tell about your skills is, well, you! Teaching others what you know is a way to deepen your understanding. It's like viewing your skills from a different lens. Plus, it's super rewarding!\r  \n\r  \nHow about you? How many hours per week do you dedicate to learning something new in your field? Let's share and learn together.",

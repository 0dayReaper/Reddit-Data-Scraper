Being single isn\u2019t bad. Chase your goals. Relationships will come when you\u2019re healthy mentally, physically, and financially. You\u2019re clearly not as of now. Bring that change. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight. It happens with small changes that keep in your day to day life. Pick up a book. Learn how to better your circumstances. Stop chasing pussy. \n\nI hear this saying a lot. \u201cIf you spend your time chasing butterflies they\u2019ll fly away. If you spend your time building a beautiful garden they\u2019ll come to you.\u201d",

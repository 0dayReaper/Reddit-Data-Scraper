    "postText": "I'm 25. May get downvoted but working full time and going to school just not to have loans is tough on me mentally. I had a few friends that basically took out student loans and partied, traveled, eat out every day, and somehow they were able to get good jobs and have a \"normal life\". My cousin became a camgirl and she has a home and a nice car by 27. When I was homeless my credit score went to shit anyway. The little bit of money I did save ended up being gone. I'm honestly not sure at this point what to do. I have a full time job, can not afford an apartment, I don't have time on the weekends to do another job to make more because I'm in school. I'm tired of being the \"responsible adult\" because it doesn't get you anywhere.",

            "comment": "This might not be what you want to hear, but the truth is that there is no such thing as a \"responsible adult\". If you were told that doing things \"right\" would guarantee success, you were sold a lie. \n\nSome people lie their way through their resume and never face consequences. Some people become sugar babies or marry rich. Some are born with the genetic lottery. There may be karma. Or maybe not. Sometimes bad people just live happy lives. \n\nNone of it is fair, but none of it will help you.\n\nNo one knows how the next few years will turn out, maybe she'll lose her house, or maybe she'll buy some stocks that'll 10x value. But all I know is that it will not affect YOUR life. \n\nFocus on your lane, make your choices about you.",

I spoke with a shitty lawyer to try to sue, but the lawyer gave me bad advice and I never pursued it further because I was too depressed. Meanwhile, I have 2 friends who literally live off lawsuit earnings. Lawsuits that are stupid, yet they've made hundreds of thousands of dollars. While my dad LITERALLY DIED on the job, and my family was left with nothing. \n\nI also have a girl friend who has never had a job in her life. At 32 she met a guy, now she's pregnant with her second kid and he provides for everything. He has his own law firm. She's set for life. \n\nAnd I have a guy friend who never had a job. His parents supported his lavish lifestyle. At 31 he randomly got a job to basically party with celebrities. It's bizarre. And he's able to live a really comfy life in a nice apartment in NYC. And he barely even \"works\". \n\nMeanwhile, I stare into a computer all day, trying to churn out work as quickly as possible,\nso that I don't get fired. And I earn shit money. \n\nIt's depressing AF, but some people just have it easy in life. Comparing will only drive you insane. Although I'm obviously guilty of it too.",

It helps to approach the case by telling the lawyer \"I know the chances of this going ahead are super slim, but I am approaching you on the understanding that you have so much expertise in the field that you'll find that exception in the case law and won't mind trying, jist to see if we can push the envelope.

There is always someone who has a vastly better life than you on the surface, so it's very detrimental to compare yourself with them. \n\nYou can compare yourself to peers and it is a very natural thing to do. But you need to have the right attitude about it, otherwise you will inevitably get jealous and sad. The right attitude is to find out if you can improve yourself based on what your peers are doing. And it's also important to be sympathetic to the other person when you compare.\n\nAn example is comparing your wage with a coworker. You might find out that you earn significantly less than them. Then it's so important that you don't get jealous, but instead you should realize that you have gained some valuable information about what your company is willing to pay. \n\nYou shouldn't immediately jump to the conclusion that you deserve to earn the same as them, because inevitably your coworker is different than you. But still you are more informed and can make a decision, whether it be staying at the company and asking your boss for a raise, looking elsewhere, or maybe just being content with what you earn.",

You're filling in the gaps with highlights. You're idealizing it. You have **no idea** what their internal worlds are like. You don't know what they struggle with, or why, or what keeps them up at night. \n\nI have a friend who makes a quarter of a million dollars a year managing girls for OnlyFans. Dude spends his days around beautiful, naked women and makes tons of money doing it. \n\nHe hates it. \n\nMost guys would dream of it but he says everyone is fake and he has no idea what anyone actually wants from him. He wants to find a girlfriend and settle down - we're rapidly approaching middle age - and every girl that talks to him is either a.) trying to get in on the hustle or b.) wants to separate themselves from him because of the hustle. \n\nMy ex grew up in one of the richest cities in the country. It was a gated community in a suburb of San Diego. The lowest homes were in the millions. They had one of the least expensive homes (say, 1-2M) and were seen as poor in the community (or at least that's how her father felt...though I could imagine it being true). \n\nLots of kids in that community grew up without struggle. The type that would get a Porsche for their 16th birthday, wrap it around a poll, and then get an Audi. These are the sorts of kids I used to envy, especially when I got a hand me down car that I whined about (like an ungrateful shit) because I compared myself to people like them growing up. \n\nThese kids are in their mid-to-late 20s now. A lot of them have been in and out of rehab. They've had lives devoid of struggle, absent of purpose. \n\nListen, I'm not glorifying the struggle nor am I attempting to glorify the opposite end of the spectrum (eg extreme poverty or an absence of opportunity/hope). But there is a happy middle. I'd much rather live the life I have now where I work my ass off for what I have - I've got some student loan and credit card debt, sure - but I also have and make more than most. I'm extremely grateful for that - and if I'm being honest, I want the Audi. I want the nice house and the nice vacations. I want the markers of success. But I want to *earn* them. \n\nIt gives me purpose and something to work for. Something to look forward to. \n\nTo bring it back to the original statement: \"you don't only get the lambo.\" You get everything. The whole kit and kaboodle. You get their struggles. And you can't possibly know what those are. Everyone, including the camgirls, have their struggles.  You're not going to get out of life without them. \n\nIf you're lucky, you get to choose what yours are. \n\nMany don't get to choose. \n\nToday, I'm grateful that I get to choose mine. \n\nI don't know if this was helpful, I hope it was. Truly. I know that feeling and it sucks. I've been there. Just know that it can better. You're young. 25 is so, so young. I know it doesn't feel like it...but it is. At the risk of sounding like...well, my Dad (bless his heart) and many other older folks, you couldn't possibly know how young 25 is. \n\nI'm 33 and gosh, I'm still realizing how remarkably young I am now. \n\nThings can get better. \n\nI won't hit you with some empty platitude like \"they will get better.\" That feels empty and hollow...and quite honestly, I don't really know. \n\nBut they can. Things can get *so much better* but you have to stay open to the possibility of that happening.",

I'm a 26 year old student living in a kind of run down, cheap place, with roommates, and I'm a highly disabled cancer survivor. That's not most people's definition of success\n\nHowever, they're my close friends, I have an internship with a leader in my industry, I make enough through wages and grants that I can splurge on toys and going out without worrying about it, have a large social circle, and I'm doing better and better health wise\n\nThat's enough for me\n\nI don't care that some onlyfans girl is working 2 hours a day and has never been seriously ill, yet is raking the cash in. That has zero to do with me\n\nIt's a great mindset because I don't care how good my fellow interns are doing, so I cheer them on and help them out however I can. Because their success doesn't affect me. Even if there was only one full time position after graduation and I didn't get that, I see that as me not having done good enough, not that I lost a competition. Plus I know I'd get a job at some other company\n\nSame with dating. Some other guy got the girl not because he was better than me, but because he was better for her than I was. So I'll just keep wandering around until I bump I to someone I'm better for",

That's all that matters: to build and grow your own life with with you have in hand. What a \"good life\" means is something deeply personal and can always change over time.",

Or rather, it removes nuance from what the \"right things\" are. \n\nMore or less, those 'right things' will generally lead to success, or a decent standard of living. But it's not as simple as a checklist, in the same way that you can't just put four walls and a roof together and have a house. Unless you do it correctly, and do it well, you'll just get a pile of rubble. And that's the same with those 'right things' - you still need to do them correctly, and do them well.",

The quicker you can do that the sooner you will be able to really start living your life according to the way YOU want to live it. \n\nWe live in the social media age, this shit just came out of nowhere and was not to be expected. Who would think that you could become a millionaire just by making stupid YouTube videos, or that becoming a porn actress would be a legitimate option for many women. Asi es la vida...\n\nThat is also no guarantee that these people are happy just because they have money. Don't idolize people with money.

You generally get out of life what you put in, but people are terrible at objectively assessing what they \"put in\". You'll have someone complain that they work so hard and get nowhere in life, and then realise they're doing the equivalent of digging holes and filling them back in - yeah that's hard work, but also of course they're getting nowhere.",

Do you know how many things can happen to a person on this planet, at any time of day, for any reason? Thats a looooot of things that you have no real control over. Arguably you've got it reversed, people have no control over the vast majority of the things that happen to them. Due to luck, personality, circumstance or other factors, it's definitely possible for humans to find ways to exploit the things that happen to them and come out with a better outcome. But that is in no way guaranteed. And certainly not to a point of having 99% control.\n\nI'm not sure if I envy people who view the world like that or not. On one hand, your life must have felt idk, not terrible to live if you've managed to feel like you're always in that much control. On the other hand, the reality is that you *aren't* in as much control as you think you are. Some people will have to accept that at some point in their lives and some people will never need to.",

Cam girls can make VERY good money relative to the amount of time and effort they have to spend making that money, that's just a fact. Rather than setting up op to take these resentments and turn them into smug superiorities in their mind, I would argue that it's better for op to accept the lesson that some people simply do not have to work as hard as others to achieve far more than others. Knowing and accepting this allows you to move on with the understanding that this is the way of the world, not some special punishment for op and reward for the sister. Op and their sister rolled the dice and their sister got a better roll.\n\nWe shouldn't pretend that life is some idk, manga or Netflix show where the underdog is actually special and better than everyone else.

Time needs to pass for 1) you to reach your goals, especially since it seems they\u2019re related to your goals, and for 2) your goals to change. \n\nI wonder if you\u2019re living with a goal that\u2019s not yours. If so, this might help. \n\nJohn Mayer has a lyric from a song (the song itself is sad, but there\u2019s hope in this line): \u201cStill have dreams/ They\u2019re not the same/ They don\u2019t fly as high as they used to.\u201d That doesn\u2019t have to be a BAD thing. Your \u201chigh dreams\u201d might not even be your own. That idea is subjective. Or, you might be going off something you wanted when you were five, which was probably somewhat unrealistic once you actually learn your wants and abilities as you get older. This idea can actually be freeing. It eventually was for me. \n\nEveryone in my immediate family is in business/ engineering. They\u2019re all business, math, and science people. When I majored in the humanities in college, I disappointed my older brother and my mom, because they knew how smart I was and thought I was \u201cwasting it.\u201d My IQ is high; my test scores were high. What the hell was I doing? Money is SO important to them, so I thought it had to be to me; they had that path chosen for me. Thing is - it\u2019s my life. I\u2019m the one that has to live it, not them. \n\nI tried to do that route after college, and I even remember when I was a VP, my boss told me I had the brains and drive to be a CEO, but I didn\u2019t have the stomach for it; my feelings would always get in the way. I had always known that, but I tried to push it away. When he pointed it out, it did something. So I said fuck it, and I went back to school when I was 28 and got my M. Ed so I could be a teacher. I always wanted to be, but this idea that I was \u201cslumming it\u201d when I had a brain \u201cthat could take me anywhere\u201d kept me from it. Comparisons between my brothers kept me from it. But it nagged at me, and no matter WHAT I did, I still didn\u2019t meet these insane expectations for my family that ultimately I had set for myself, based on what I \u201cshould\u201d do and not what I wanted to do. \n\nI gave up a much larger salary and a cushy job with prestige in a huge, vibrant city to become a high school teacher in a very poor part of Appalachia. To my brothers (and maybe society, or anyone objectively looking at my resume, since America is fucking obsessive with \u201chustle culture\u201d), it looked like a dive into mediocrity because \u201cthose who can\u2019t, teach.\u201d If I HAD to go the humanities route, I\u2019d at least be a successful writer\u2026right? I would never be something as \u201cuseless\u201d as a \u201cglorified babysitter\u201d (everything in quotes is what has been told to me by my family). My college friends were even confused that I, a liberal, could teach in such a conservative area and be so close with the people I see every day. I had followed this narrative everyone else had written for me, and now I wasn\u2019t anymore. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, though - I love my life. I love my classroom and my school, and I love achieving what I\u2019VE set for myself. If I ever leave the classroom, I\u2019m still not leaving education. Someone in our district asked what I wanted to do; I could be an admin, etc. I pointed at my desk chair and said I wanted to sit there for the next thirty years. I want my porch and my plants and my pets and my midwestern life. My two brothers live in Silicon Valley; they\u2019re both incredibly wealthy. They work from home, live close to the mountains and have this \u201cideal\u201d life everyone in my family has strived for. Good for them; I hope they\u2019re happy. Good for me; I\u2019m happy, too. And when they bash my community, or my choice in field, or say offensive things about the kids I teach and the class of the community, I silence that text thread. I don\u2019t share stories anymore. Nothing is going to make me feel bad about this because I don\u2019t, and I\u2019m done letting others rent room in my head. \n\nThis might be an internal conversation with yourself that you have to silence. Step away from the comparisons; they\u2019ll only derail you from what you want. It\u2019s your life. There is no \u201cright path.\u201d If there is, I sure as shit didn\u2019t take it. I spent my early twenties as an alcoholic with a LOT of issues. Many of those were based in the toxicity I grew up with, which included this constant berating. And guess what - I eventually found my way, and it actually led to more success and happiness once I defined what I wanted for myself. \n\nMaybe I\u2019ll write that best-selling book one day. Maybe this horrible view of public education will change. If I don\u2019t - meh. If it doesn\u2019t - meh. My priorities have changed to MY priorities. And I\u2019m happy; and when I\u2019m not, because of those around me or my own thoughts, I silence that text thread.",

When I was in school, I picked up one client, charged them $1K/month and only did 4-10 hours of work a month.\n\nI was in school full-time, with my classes condensed to two days a week, and I worked a full time job the other five days a week, and did my freelance work when I had any free time. When I graduated, I already had work experience, got a job right away, paid off my student debt, and used my freelance money to take evening classes. I spent $5K, on three programs and did all of them in one year, three nights a week. Those courses, in addition to my degree, doubled my salary to a six figure job. \n\nWhen I feel stuck, I commit myself to a hustle year. I force myself to commit to whatever I think will help me level up. For that year, I rarely go out, do anything fun, or shop, and because my schedule is so tight, I don't even have the emotional bandwidth to worry about much else. I think one hustle year = 3-5 years of acceleration.\n\nDW about what anyone else is doing. Just commit to one year of giving yourself a massive headstart. It isn't easy, but it's worth it. Deciding to do it for just one year, is so helpful, because you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. It's temporary suffering for permanent gain.",

You\u2019re grinding your ass off to make a better future for yourself? Have your cousins or friends really ever gone through something like that? You can take the easy route, sure, but clearly you weren\u2019t meant to. There\u2019s something much deeper inside of you asking to be seen. Use your moral compass to guide you. It seems it\u2019s time to step back and re-evaluate. The safe route of going to school just to get a 9-5 like our parents did doesn\u2019t cut it anymore.

I have a job, but I\u2019m smothered in student loans while some of my friends have good paying jobs simply for being pretty. It kills me to think that we make about the same or they make more money with more free time. Point is, you will always have these thoughts when you compare yourself to others. \n\nHere are a few things I think you should keep in mind:\n1. Everyone looks great in their 20s but looks are temporary. Being a cam girl now seems to be going well for her but what skills did she build for her resume? What is she going to tell future employers about her work history? Also, future employers will likely see she she was a cam girl (hard to erase the internet).\n2. When she meets someone she may potentially marry, what is she going to tell the parents she does for work? Also, and not to be offensive to your cousin, but what kind of quality guy/girl is she going to attract being a cam girl? Quality men/women usually want someone with more substance.\n3. When looks fade and it\u2019s time for a job that isn\u2019t about looks, she\u2019s going to have to start all over again when everyone else is already established in their careers. \n4. Assuming she wants kids, what does she tell them?\n\nYou\u2019re doing fine. Most people (including me) have very similar stories from their 20s. If anything, network and make connections in the career you\u2019re working for to leverage you\u2019re chances of getting hired later. \n\nOne piece of advice I was given awhile back that I dismissed until I got older was to enjoy the process. Life is tough and grueling but look for ways to enjoy what you\u2019re going through. I promise there will be times in the future where you will look back and miss certain aspects of you\u2019re life today.",

So often doing the \"right thing\", is the safest way in the long term. Safe from social, legal, health etc repercussions.\n\nAnother question is what do you want to get and how to deserve it. I have some relatives who worked their asses off by studying and working 100h weeks their entire youth, saved a lot of money, which got compounded via investmentes and interest, and got quite rich eventually. Did they also not enjoy their youth years much? Yes. Are they happy with their wealth? I don't know. Did they deserve it, More than others.

Not sure where you are located, but the cost of living in most places has skyrocketed and the housing market is stupidly high to the point most \"cheap\" apartments cost as much if not more than most people's mortgage payments.\n\nMost people I know who are in their early 20s could never move out on their own, hold a full time job and go to/pay for school. Most people in your situation would be either living with parents or relatives, or have a few roommates to split the cost of living with. You also don't have to do everything on your own, it sounds like you want to, but sometimes that's just not possible until later on down the road.\n\nIf you are not getting the pay or job you want, start putting in applications every where you can for a new job. If you like your current job but the pay sucks, talk to your manager or supervisor and see what it take to get a bump in your pay. Sometimes you need to be the one who takes the initiative to ask about your pay.\n\nAs for your cam girl cousin, that's great that she is making all that money now. What happens in a year... Month... Couple weeks.. when her fan base declines or moves on or cant afford to continue to see her and her sole source of income is cut down dramatically? In 5 years from now, she could be struggling where you are now and you'll be in a much better position with your career.

Now or later? \nWhat are the pros and cons of your current workplace? \n\nAlso, what does your budget look like? \nAre your priorities aligned in a way to support your long term goals? \nIs there a way to count down to the next big change? (I mean - I worked out my loans based on what I was paying and how many weeks it would take me to pay them off. It was incredibly relieving to see the number go down - may not work for you. But it made paying off my loans more bearable for me)",

            "comment": "Well first of all that's why they call it a work/life BALANCE. You have to learn to juggle hobbies and interests you find fulfilling and fun with the career that lets you do it. So for the people who went out and partied, they valued partying, and that's what they chose to do with their free time, but I doubt they were reading novels or making art, you understand? Plus, who even says they enjoyed it? Maybe they just went due to peer pressure/societal expectations from their clique on what people their age should be doing? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, survivorship bias: for every one \"partyboy\" successful student, 4 more dropped out. For every one rich millionaire camgirl, 3 more are destitute, careers and future prospects compromised due to internet exposure. Does that make sense? Sure, you played it safe, and yes, playing it safe is less fun... but there's less risk too! Also, ask yourself, do you even LIKE partying or clubbing? My friends go every weekend but I can't be bothered because I know I don't like it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright, since you're comparing let's talk pros and cons.  Your cousin: appears to be rich (might not be btw, could just be dust in the wind and social appearance), BUT, has probably had to do tons of degrading things that you don't know about (look up all the horrid things instagram influencers go to Dubai to do for money) and think about the things your cousin probably had to do. She probably had to sell her soul. Had to expose herself to degenerate strangers online (such as the gentlemen in the comments asking for the other guy's sister's name) and etc... I couldn't do that. Not for all the money or clout in the world. Ask yourself if you could. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo really, if your career isn't providing enough, look into changing jobs/locations/careers/lifestyle. I know everyone online is griping about \"unlivable\" wages in America but as someone who spent time homeless and is an immigrant in this country, there are absolutely ways you can flourish. It's just that the average American internet denizen lacks the imagination, creativity, drive or capability to flourish. If you don't make enough right now to afford an apartment in Midtown, NYC... don't live there! Lots of great opportunities in rural areas around the world. Those places also tend to have a slower pace of life, more peaceful, etc...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust remember. Life is what you make of it. You can be a responsible adult and then go to swinger parties/raves/orgies/beach parties in your spare time.... but you have to take the initiative to find like minded people, socialize and invest your time and energy (which you could be spending on other things) on those activities. I hike on the weekends. I'm finishing up my degree and I still make time to write novels and collect fountain pens and have a wonderful girlfriend and so many great things that others take for granted. You'd be surprised just how good you have it if you took the time to look around and appreciate things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing that changed my life was this: Don't wait for Gandalf to come knocking on your door offering you adventure. Be Gandalf.",

It has been a very difficult lesson, and it came from realizing that one of the reasons I dislike myself is that I consistently react without thinking about if that reactions further my goals. It takes a lot of goddamn time, because I have to notice all of the automatic little choices I make every day without realizing. So far, it has been worth it, and has helped more than any of the hundreds of ill-defined milestones and benchmarkers I've set for myself. \n\nIf you were to look back at yourself in 20 years, what's the best possible decision you could have made? It's usually the thing opposite to what our own anxieties or depression etc are telling us to do, so it's gonna be hard and you won't always achieve that marker because you can only control yourself. But you will create more opportunities, and you will become practiced in setting standards to your desires rather than \"right\" and \"wrong\" or what others think. \n\nThe real answer is her choices weren't wrong. Possibly wrong for someone else, but she sounds successful and it sounds like she loves and is good at what she does for a career. We should all hope to be so lucky. Figure out what that looks like for you, decide if it's based on your own values or society's, and start putting in elbow grease. You can do this, and I believe in you.",

            "comment": "Well, while your cousin is not the best rolemodel, she is in the regard that she has left the common path that most people are on. That path only leads to misery and a slow death. If you're sick of playing by the rules and not getting shit in return, then stop doing it. Look for other ways to make money. There's an endless amount of opportunities available today but you're not gonna find them in the education system and on the path that everyone else is on. If you want to have a better life, then you have to be willing to stop following the herd and to start looking for better options.\n\nJust trying to get a better job won't help you most likely. This system we're all living in is not designed to make people happy and fufilled. It's mainyl designed to provide the industry with what it needs: cheap labor and an endless amount of mindless consumers. People who do nothing but follow the rules of society and consume stuff all day long are easily controlled, so the government prefers to keep things that way as well. If you don't want to lead that kind of life, pretending that everything's okay and things are not that bad, while distracting yourself all day so you don't have to think about your life, then it's time to break out of it. I can't tell you what to do exactly because everyone needs to figure it out for themselves. But if you start looking for opportunities you might find plenty. Most of them might not appeal to you, like what your cousin is doing. But if you keep looking you might eventually find something that's the right fit for you. And if you don't, well, I'm sure you can imagine yourself where your current path would lead if you stayed on it.\n\nThe only person that could ever be happy by living life according to the rules of society is someone whose most important goal in life is to be a part of the herd. Everyone else might have some things they enjoy, while putting up with most other things like having to work a random job each day for 8 hours. There's pretty much no one who enjoys that but everyone has accepted it as inevitable. While those who dared to question the status quo, who are not okay with it and have started looking for better alternatives. Those are the ones that people tend to idolize. Because they're living the life that everyone else would like to live but most people are just to scared to even considered doing what their idols did. Leaving the herd and forging your own path in life.",

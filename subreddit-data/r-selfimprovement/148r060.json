    "postText": "I hope everyone has been making strides in their progress on whatever it is you all are doing.\n\nAfter I graduated from high school I briefly attended undergrad before switching to a culinary program. Upon completion I began my career in that field. (It was a blast, had a really good experience!) \n\nIn September of 2019 I started a small business catering with the intent to eventually teach a hands-on culinary experience. Obviously we know what happened in 2020.\n\nIn August of 2020 a very close friend asked if I wanted to work in film as a scenic painter. (I had worked a little bit prior to the pandemic just kind of helping out the true talent here and there while working on my business.) \n\nI leaned into the industry hard once I realized that a lot of the people on the crew were kind of just taking it easy and cruising through it. (It is a union gig so those who know...know.)\n\nI worked on some big movies, had some fun, made a little bit of money, but ultimately, the crew/friends I was working with have not really wanted to...grow for lack of better terms. \n\nWe work  long and demanding hours. In the event we get a weekend, we party, drink, smoke, etc. While it has been all fun and games as well as 'lucrative' I really just cant help feeling like I am doing nothing for anybody but myself. And for 'myself' just making money. \n\nIn addition, I have a pretty successful small business that has been growing and I can see the future is bright but at the same time. It's only for me.\n\nDoes it make money? YES.\n\nCan I see the future bringing me more success? YES.\n\nDoes it help others? Not really. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR:\n\nI want to be my best for others. I want to be apart of a larger effort. Be impactful. \n\nI had struggled with depression when I was young but really found who I was while grinding away in kitchens. Developing professionalism as well as a palate. \n\nI was happier while I was cooking at a higher level however, as I age, I see myself babysitting those who I made a point to separate myself from down the road. Some say that is what a 'chef' is yet all I see myself as is a 'kitchen manager.' \n\nI am getting clean (weed). Enlisting in the Navy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there anyone else who has done something like this here?\n\nLooking for insight. Am I crazed? Is this far-fetched?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your input and I hope yall continue to strive to be the best version of yourself!\n\n\\~Spoon Man\\~",

I'm asking these questions sincerely because I don't see you commenting a whole lot about how this all makes you feel because this is a lot man. This is a big change for you and I'm happy for you that's great.",

Recruiter was just like \"Soldiers don't have asthma son.\" So I was like damn, guess I got to figure something out. \n\nI also had no direction then. Went into culinary and fell in love. Just also fell out of love a bit too. I've 'been there, done that' so to speak. \n\nWorked for James Beard Winners. Michellin Star chefs. Just personally, I don't give a shit about the culinary accolades. I am no Jacques Pepin, Anthony Bourdain, or Guy Fieri (HAHAHA that is a joke. I have an afro.) for that matter.\n\n James Beard awards are partially bought to be completely honest. I remember my chef who actually taught me SO much said that he paid $5K just to get a nomination from the James Beard Foundation. THEN, had to fly his ass up to NY along with his gear to cook for the foundation. That kind of fucked the whole game up for me. I guess I wanted it to be based off merit and dedication. Which it is to a certain degree but not entirely. \n\nNow I have WAY more drive and focus as well as some higher education. \n\nI am trying to get into a Mass Communications career field. Be it photography, journalism, broadcasting, etc. I love to tell stories. Telling the story of the Navy and the people that make it would be pretty damn cool. I want to be on those massive ships, watching some of the most advanced technology be put to work learning skills. \n\nI also met a guy, 54, in Hawaii last year who said he joined at 33 and it was the best decision he had ever made. \n\nI also don't think I am old. lol. \n\nI am just trying to wear all the shoes/hats/shirts in this life. \n\n\"Life is short but it is the longest thing you will ever do.\"",

When it burns it burns hot and it drives you all the way. But sometimes it burns out and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that and It sounds like you're moving on in a healthy direction of growth. You also have a fallback plan if shit hits the fan. For your journaling passion, I think that's really cool and I encourage you to search in what ways you would like to further that passion for journaling. Maybe you could try working for a big outlet for mass media That would be a really cool job I'm sure you would get to see a lot. Navy is potentially really rewarding as well You would get to see so many places What is your passion though?",

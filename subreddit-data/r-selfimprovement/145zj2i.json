    "postText": "So I\u2019m m24 introvert/quiet/social anxiety(all 3) person from nyc and I\u2019ve been making\u2026slow but steady changes/improvements in my life the last handful of years.\n\nDoing the best I have been so far in college with a year left, been working out and starting to see the changes in my body(again nothing grand I went from skinny to skinny with slight muscle), started making a little money from an online part time job and just all around maturing.\n\nHowever, I feel like my last big hurdle is socially. Most my social interactions come from friends online and I know I need to meet and have friends in real life but this is hard to do for me. I\u2019ve tried joining a school club and that didn\u2019t work, or discord servers that are suppose to be local but that hasn\u2019t really worked either(I\u2019m not really active in them tbf, but it\u2019s hard to just randomly jump into a server and not no anyone) I\u2019ve thought about making my own discord server for people to meet but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019d work.\n\nAlso I don\u2019t want to make this post about dating and women, but I do want to get experience actually dating women. Having no romantic experience at this age regardless of what people say does weigh on me in a negative way. And yes I know women are human too but when you find yourself attracted to one it feels like a different game with different rules then just getting to know a woman platonically. I want to get experience with both (friendship and relationship) in terms of women. I tried bumble in the past for a month but got nothing out of it so I just deleted it.\n\nMy question is, how and where do I go to improve myself socially, especially in the summer. People are going to recommend events and such but has that actually been helpful to anyone? Do people in my age range actually do that stuff? From what I know a lot of people in my age range meet on social media, and atm my account if pretty dead.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in the early stages of figuring the same problem out. What I started doing is forcing myself to go out 3 days a week NO MATTER WHAT (unless I\u2019m sick). This is the best way to start. If nobody wants to go out with you, you just go alone. Go to a pool hall, bar, or other social venue. Give yourself permission to start slow. The first couple weeks all you have to do is show up. Side note, limit the drinking or don\u2019t drink at all. Our goal here is helping you become social and grow a social circle, not become an alcoholic. \n\nAfter a couple weeks of doing this, set a new goal. Try to talk to someone each night. Every week you can set a little higher goal within your comfort level.\n\nIf you ever connect with someone, ALWAYS get their phone number or Instagram and ALWAYS reach out to them another day to do X activity that you connected over. This is crucial to making friends. \n\nOther activities work for your social event, like sports leagues, trivia night, things like that. As long as the primary thing people are doing is socializing. Something like Jiu Jitsu Is fun but I realized it doesn\u2019t count as socializing because people aren\u2019t really concerned with talking at my gym that much. \n\nOh and make it a habit to talk with everyone everywhere you go. Man or woman. As your social life grows girls will naturally come into your life. But you don\u2019t want to start with focusing on getting girls because a social life and social circle is more of a prerequisite when you have no friends or social hobbies. You don\u2019t want to get into relationship and make that person responsible for meeting your social needs. Get a great social life first, then a women will be a compliment to your life and you also won\u2019t need her as much.",

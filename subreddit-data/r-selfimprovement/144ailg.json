    "postText": "I've been in and out of relationships for about 3 years now, after my recent breakup, where he ghosted me and got with someone else immediately, it made me realize how much my self esteem depended on him, and how I clearly had no self respect in the first place with all the things I've allowed him to do to me and get away with, I've only recently been noticing the red flags and was gonna leave him anyway so I suppose that makes it hurt a little less. But the thoughts like \"he left because she's better than you\" won't leave my head.\nThat's only relevant since it's what made me realize I should focus on myself in the first place.\n\nOther than that, I've never been a confident person, I've never been able to look in the mirror and like what i see, i hated myself and i still kinda do.\n\nI just need tips on how i could learn to love myself &amp; be by myself, I feel like it'd help me alot rn, because I feel alot better than i did some days ago, and i do get over things fairly quickly, but I'd love to speed up the process.\n\nI've also been working out consistently for the first time, which is a huge step for me honestly, but other ways to focus on myself would help alot.\n\nthis post is all over the place so i feel like I'm just venting, but replies &amp; opinions would be appreciated :)\n\n**UPDATE** I no longer feel like what happened is my fault, mostly because I found out that my ex is just a manipulator that has done the same thing to multiple other girls.",

            "comment": "First off, congratulations on working out consistently. I hope it makes you feel and look better.\n\nSecondly, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been in and out of relationships these last few years. Especially sorry how the last ended. However, you have been in and out of relationships the last few years. There are many out there who have not been, maybe even ever. The fact you can keep entering relationships tells me that you must be engaging and or attractive some how. Whether you\u2019re a great listener or have spectacular eyes that is already part of who you are. Acknowledge these things, be proud of these things.\n\nAlso, there has to be a time in your life you accomplished something, even something small, and thought \u201chey I did that\u201d. Whether a physical thing you built, a presentation you nailed, or even looking good in a coat etc, you accomplished something. You probably do it often, but your lack of self esteem has been hiding the fact from you. If you ever feel even a quantum of joy for anything you do, realize it is either something you are actually already good at or it\u2019s something you can build on. \n\nWhen you do something good, own it. Let it fill you up. Let your own pride and satisfaction being the driving factor for it. Sure it\u2019s nice when people compliment you for being smart, strong, attractive etc. But the most important opinion is your own. Don\u2019t be conceited mind you. But if you\u2019ve done something good and you\u2019re proud, other people being proud is just the cherry on top.\n\nTLDR; you\u2019re probably already awesome somehow. Own it, build on it, believe in yourself.",

That actually really helped since I'm not in the best mood as of right now, I really should try to appreciate the small things that I'm good at.\nI know self improvement will be a slow process but I'll try to keep motivated. Just because some people dont appreciate me doesn't mean I can't appreciate myself. :) Might end up coming back to this response i really appreciate it",

Maybe replace every \"your\" with \"my\" since I can only speak of my experience. Don't forsake what truly matters to you and don't let people tell you what matters to you is unimportant",

I mean I think you're pretty fucking cool. And your ex seems like at least a bit of a douchebag (actually he seems like more than a bit of one but I'm trying to be nice).\n\nYou should just try to focus on the stuff you like about yourself, and diminish the stuff you're not so happy about/are still working on. We all have flaws, like so what that you have some too, of course you do. You'll work on them and on the whole you're still pretty friggin dope. Actually, now that d-bag is out of the picture this opens up a whole world of exciting new possibilities for you. Things are about to get pretty cool and interesting!",

Feels good hearing that from someone I'm not friends with :) \nTo be honest this situation made me lose hope in relationships if they're gonna make me hurt this much, but i know that working on myself would help prevent me from ever feeling like this again and that gives me sm more hope.\nI want to work on myself for me, but every once in awhile I'm like \"i want to make him regret it, i want him to see me do better\" because I'm obviously mad at him and i feel really disrespected, but i shouldnt have to use him as my main motivation to do better or i won't actually get better.\nHearing something similar from everybody makes me feel sm better, and ik ill start doing better from now on :)) i appreciate it",

            "comment": "I'm sorry to hear that you've been struggling with self-worth and have had negative experiences in relationships. It's important to remember that your self-worth should not depend on someone else's opinion of you or your relationship status. Building self-love and confidence takes time, but here are some tips that can help:\n\n1. Practice self-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, just as you would a close friend. Be gentle with yourself and acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes and goes through difficult times.\n\n2. Challenge negative self-talk: Notice when you have self-deprecating thoughts and consciously replace them with positive and affirming ones. Focus on your strengths, achievements, and the things you appreciate about yourself.\n\n3. Set healthy boundaries: Learn to assert your needs and establish boundaries in your relationships. This will help you prioritize your well-being and prevent situations where you feel disrespected or taken advantage of.\n\n4. Engage in self-care activities: Dedicate time to activities that bring you joy and help you relax. This could include hobbies, pampering yourself, spending time in nature, reading, or listening to music. Find what resonates with you and makes you feel good.\n\n5. Surround yourself with positive influences: Spend time with people who uplift and support you. Seek out friends, family, or communities that are understanding, caring, and positive. Having a strong support system can greatly contribute to your self-esteem.\n\n6. Focus on personal growth: Invest in your personal development and pursue activities that allow you to learn and grow. This could be enrolling in a course, developing new skills, or pursuing goals that align with your passions. Accomplishing these goals can boost your confidence and give you a sense of purpose.\n\n7. Practice mindfulness and self-reflection: Take time to check in with yourself and reflect on your thoughts and emotions. Mindfulness exercises, such as meditation or journaling, can help you become more self-aware and cultivate a deeper understanding of yourself.\n\n8. Seek professional help if needed: Consider working with a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and support as you navigate through your self-worth journey. They can help you explore underlying issues, develop coping strategies, and provide valuable insights.\n\nRemember, self-love is a lifelong journey, and it's okay to have ups and downs along the way. Be patient and kind to yourself, and celebrate the progress you make, no matter how small it may seem. You deserve to love and appreciate yourself for who you are.",

This may not be useful to you but I think sometimes people end up choosing bad relationships because theyre not confident in themselves to begin with so they'll take anyone that treats them good. However that doesn't make you a bad partner. They're still bad people for manipulating you but maybe you need to figure out why you're picking bad partners and focus on improving that? Nobody can tell you what the reason may be you need to look within yourself and figure it out. Best of luck",

I started to see positive changes in my self-image when I made it an intention to practice this mindset and reflect on where I am/where I want to be . Personally, Superhuman meditations have been a major tool for adopting a mindset of self-worth. I\u2019ve now reached a deep level of self-acceptance, pride for who I am, massive boost in my confidence, and continuous practice of nurturing my positive self-image.

It\u2019s because maybe you eat junk food and you have a desk job that doesn\u2019t allow you to move a lot and yoy dont workout (1.2) then you can start eating healthier slowly and start exercising or moving more slowly (1.3)\n\nIf you follow all this my god u will love your self\n\n2) now maybe you dont like something thats not in your control like maybe your height \nWell here nothing much can be done all you have to do is think deeply for eg \u201c i am short and its not really my  fault i am short what can i do for that its out of my control people make fun of me but why should i care if its funny to them it should not hurt my feelings because they aren\u2019t necessarily making fun of me they are making fun of a fact and the fact is i am short and i will be forever till i die so i can just accept it \u201c\n3 change aspects that you dont hate for example you might hate yourself and you might be earning ok money now lets keep all the reeason for ur self hate same lets just increase your money now u will hate yoyr self less tryst me",

I would recommend Kelly-Ann Maddox.  She is a YouTuber who does a series every year called \"Self Love September\" and she has a ton of great tips and info to help you on your self love journey.  I would start at the beginning with the Self Love September 2014 playlist.\n\nLearning to love yourself is totally a journey.  It takes time and is a lot of work, but it is so worth it.  I started working on self love a few years ago, and the way I treat myself and feel about myself has really improved.  I am just so much happier and am kinder to myself now.  \n\nIt is a lifelong thing and you will have ups and downs, but \nI know you can do it! \ud83d\udc95",

Mine was I always had good intentions but most of the time good intentions are just that,,, good intentions. Losing the one I called my superwoman sent me into a stage of rage and hate. Even lying to people to set them up to be jacked or even worse. Leave that there in order not to incriminate myself. I  hate what I did to people who really thought they where meeting me but only to faced with a different situation. Hearing the prayers of a child can really fuck you up when you know they believe wholeheartedly that their prayers are heard and would be answered because people they trust tell them will give them anything they want just ask. Seeing the looking their face when you tell them to stop asking God for that because it's not going to happen is the most painful image any man can see. Other than seeing a woman he loves with every fiber in his body being screwed by multiple men who compares nothing to him nor has the love or intentions to want to give her the world by any means necessary. Im glad I witnessed what I witnessed what I witnessed cause it caused a change in me. I then knew why God stopped listening to me because I became this anger, vengeful person that took my pain out innocent people and it was morally wrong of me. Now here i am dead to her, free of having to portray a weird as character im definitely not and not responding to negative thoughts about me with negative reactions. Now I say up thanking God for the small blessings and the for giving me the courage to stay hopeful in a world of daily negative reflections, actions and words. I won't have sex again until it's with her so if Sept of 2021 was my last time experimenting intimacy then I guess God meant for it to be that way.",

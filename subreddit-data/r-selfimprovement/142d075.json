    "postText": "People around me always tell me that I am just so negative, I am obsessed with little things, I just don't try to be positive, I just choose to be like this. Holy shit I can't fucking wrap my head around how dumb these people are. I admit all my flaws and I work really really hard to fix it. But these people are the one who say those awful discouraging things to me and I have to be the one who have to endure this torture, fix my negative thoughts that root from these words, and struggle to improve myself. WHILE THEY JUST FUCKING TELL ME I DON'T EVEN TRY. THEY ARE LITERALLY THE ONE WHO TOLD ME THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS SUCH A PROBLEM. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, THEY DON'T EVEN FUCKING TRY. BUT THEY JUST PRETEND TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ME.\n\nYeah, I am back after a few minutes. I admit that I said some very angry things. But I just want to leave that to let some of you know that I really need help. I know it's not your job. I know I have no rights to force anyone to do something for me. But it would be appreciated if I could know how to overcome the feeling of being misunderstood and the crave for someone who understand me. \n\nI know it's not anyone's job to understand me and always care about my feelings. But I am just tired. I want at least someone who understand how much pain I am going through and how much I am trying to be better. I am just so tired.\n\nBut thank you so much for reading. And I am so sorry you have to read that.",

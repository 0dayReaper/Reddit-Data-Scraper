    "postText": "Hello everyone, i'm here cause i need your wisdom\n\nFIRST A BIT ABOUT ME: 8 months ago i broke up with my gf. She treated me like a doormat and i accepted it. She went for another man (then she came back and i refused her because i don't trust her) and this completely destroyed my confidence. I never had big self confidence but i was making progress before the break up. \n\n**in a few points:**\n\n1. I constantly attract attenction to feed my ego. Everything is about me, me me.\n2. I constantly need validation and i ASK people for that. \"was good the drink i made?\" or \"was i weird talking to them?\",\"i'm funny right?\"\n\ni realised a thing lately. This mechanisms are deeply rooted in my soul and being. I probably cannot a 100% erase them but i want to be able to manage them. Self improvement is work. you have got to be clear about your goal and the goal is to build a good personality, not a needy one\n\n**My biggest issues**\n\n1. university: i'm gonna get a degree at 27 as a doctor, 2 o 3 years later than my peers who shortly will start working. i'm so ashemed that i study at home everyday to avoid telling people my situation\n2. after the break up i was diagnosed with heart condition. I had a great body and now i'm scared to train cause it's a risk. the doctors weren't very clear: \"yeah, you can train but not so much\". Which doesn't mean anything for me\n\nMy girlfriend stopped being attracted to me because of my lack of confidence, my jealousy and neediness. It's not sexy and at almost 25 yo it's time to change that\n\n**How can i do it?**\n\n1. Get to work harder on university, really pouring my soul into it\n2. start to train again even lightly\n3. stop talking so much and ask for validation. i wil start to go out with friends and be silent. I wanna learn to listen and try not to be always at the center o attention. This is the hardest but i will really try it\n\nso, now you know my situation, i would really apprecciate your insight on this. Thank you for your time",

The way I\u2019m taking it now is to really shift my focus/energy on my goals and things that make me truly happy, it\u2019s a lot of soul searching.",

                    "comment": "i think that self confidence is the key. If i believe in myself, why would i need constant validation? so how to build it? \n\n* First of all, even if i don't have anything to show i have to deeply believe that i am already enough. This is key. I can do it!\n* Then set some goals, few and easy one at first and reach them. They have to be things that do not depend on others. \"i'm gonna get that girl!\" ok, you can try but it really doesn't depend only on you. So maybe start with something like running for 30 minutes today. It's an easy goal you can do it alone. As time goes on more ambitious goals can be set and slowly and steadly it can be reached some self confidence\n\nI haven't tried yet what i am preaching but i think it is something that i'll try from now on",

I have been working out for a few years now and have really locked in since the new year and made great progress BUT I find myself from time to time feeling like I\u2019m doing these things just to get girls versus for myself. It\u2019s a hard cycle to break personally.",

Everyone has their own path ..\n(I come from a family of renowned scientist.... so I get the pressure of showing results to other people)\nBut .... I crossed paths in life with people that were way less accomplished by society standards and at the same time they were much more self-confident and genuinely happy... than those really accomplished family members and myself.\n\n-The comparison game is absolutely stupid. Life will show you thath. \nA lot of People that I envied at 25 were lost by 30.  I recently crossed paths with a friend of highschool I wanted to be like him...good looking...extroverted... it seemed he didn't give a f*ck about anything...(on the surface).\nHe is fat an alcoholic now. I feel sad for him. \n\nTwo guys that were merried at 24 and 25, and that I also envied, divorced by 30.. see? it's stupid.\n\n- you have low self esteem.\n\nGo to your friends.  Tel them how you feel. Open an honest conversation channel. \nYou need true friends that value you exactly how you are. If you aren't yourself you will never feel appreciated for who you really are. \n\nI have had this kind of conversations with some of my friends...\n One time I ranted to a friend about how I thought everything in my life was f*cked up and how I felt lost. He responded by telling me all the ways I was valuable as a person and as a friend. \nThat BOOSTED my self worth permanently. \n\n- widen your social circle. Friends, friends, friends are the answer. And true friends.\n\n- find a father figure. Someone with more experience and wisdom you can trust and relay, and go for  answers. \n\n- be your f*kin self  I bet you are a wonderful human being you. You just haven't met yourself yet! \nYou don't don't need to prove your worth every hour of everyday.\n\nPs. Sorry for my English. Is not my mother tongue.",

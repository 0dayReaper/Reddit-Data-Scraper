    "postText": "I\u2019m one of those people that does not mesh well with social media. I\u2019ve always cared a little too much what people think. At least, online anyway. I also am horrible at not comparing myself to other people.\n\nWhen i get on social media i see all my friends, or people i went to school with, make their lives look so fun and interesting. While i am basically living a fairly simple life. It really gets me down. \n\nI work, go to the gym, work on motorcycles with my dad, read, date girls sometimes. But i don\u2019t travel much, i don\u2019t have loads of friends, just a couple close ones.\n\nI get anxiety posting, even if it\u2019s something as simple as a meme. In person i\u2019m very confident and funny, charming one might say. But social media makes me not feel like i have self worth sometimes, no matter how hard i try. Sometimes i will make a post and stress about it for days sometimes, wondering why i made such a dumb post (even though it\u2019s not really dumb)\n\nI am taking a break indefinitely. I want to focus on moving in silence this summer, make real progress in my life. Then, maybe, i can think about using social media again. I\u2019m not against social media per say, but i\u2019ve always been an overthinker, philosophical, one might say. Introspective.\n\nI\u2019ve been off of it for 2 weeks, i feel so much more present, grounded, and confident than i did with it in my life. I contact people i normally wouldn\u2019t contact. It\u2019s great.\n\nI do feel a little FOMO though, hopefully i can get over that part. \n\nI\u2019m trying to get off of a natural substance i\u2019ve been addicted to for years. I need the focus more than ever. I remember reading a book called relentless, it\u2019s about one of the guys who trained Micheal Jordan, the basketball player. He says what made him so great was the ability to shut everything out and just focus. So to get off this substance, i will try just that. \n\nI\u2019m hoping one day i will have the life i want.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve been considering a break as well-I consider myself to be a lot like you. I\u2019ve gone through a pretty amazing self discovery process since December, and sometimes I see friends online and think \u201coh I should be doing that\u201d or \u201cI want a new car too\u201d, but I really try and take a step back. Most of us curate what others see-and my brother had what most of us would consider a \u201cperfect\u201d life-amazing job, 200-300k salary, wife, kids, house, etc. he died at 37 from alcohol abuse. During his last few years he was a shell of the person I knew and loved. As my outlook has changed, I find myself wanting simpler things. A simpler life with a husband, a garden, my dogs, a place to relax when the weather is nice. In addition, stripping the behaviors I do bc it\u2019s what \u201ceveryone else\u201d wants vs what I want. I was listening to a podcast where the host said your \u201cI should do this\u2026\u201d thoughts are what society has conditioned us to want vs what we really want! I\u2019ve been keeping that at the front of my mind. I\u2019m still a work in progress but it\u2019s been really freeing. i commend you for working on being your best self! It isn\u2019t easy that\u2019s for sure. My husband has a saying that everyone is just as full of shit as the next person. Some of us just hide it better than others lol! My mantra through this growth is that I am now living the life I didn\u2019t even know I was missing. Sending good vibes on your journey!",

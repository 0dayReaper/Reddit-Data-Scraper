    "postText": " Little background: I have depression, ADHD, social anxiety, GAD and PTSD and ED. I have recently became unemployed. I am 24 now and I've been struggling since I  was eight or nine. \n\nSince I've left my job, I've just been staying at home chilling. It's been maybe two weeks and my sleep schedule during this time was, by SOME miracle, quite stable. I had a few instances of pulling all nighters, but then I slept for 12 hours the next night, and generally I tried to get at least six or seven hours. \n\nI can't sit still. I always have to do something, minimal brain fog,, I am planning stuff to do, some of my appetite came back, I cleaned my closet for the first time in six years for god's sake. I even understand better when people talk to me, which is something I always struggled with! I've been doing less mistakes in resumes, I've been feeling...hopeful? Happier? \n\nI tried to pinpoint why. No medication change, no other change in my life...I really thinks it all has happened because of sleep? I still don't quite believe that it has such a huge impact. \n\nI've been doing this since I was maybe nine - I've become afraid of going to sleep because that would mean another day would come. I preferred nights, and staying alone and awake prolonged them. I started pulling all nighters, slept three or four hours usually, starred to pump myself with a caffeine. Since then I started falling asleep in cars, at school, basically anywhere and I welcomed it - the day would pass faster. \n\nSince then till my adulthood it has been the same - I always tried to change my schedule, but the fear of waking up into the next day too quickly got to me and I never managed to stabilize my sleep pattern. For years I've been very miserable and I always say that I am just...tired of life. My therapists never understood why my serotonin levels didn't balance out even if I practiced DBT, CBT, quit drugs, I did everything they asked. \n\nIs it possible that it was really, really mostly just...being tired? Lack of sleep? \n\nI am not saying all of my issues are caused by this. But I've been managing to work on the other ones in therapy. The general dread, sadness, exhaustion and wanting to die are the only things I don't know how to deal with.\n\nWas I really just this fucking stupid to not realize and ignore such a basic thing?? I can't quite believe this...",

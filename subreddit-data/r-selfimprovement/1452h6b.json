( not just to work out, eat clean and journal ).  or other forms of therapy ?",

If you only focus on things that didn't go well, especially if those are the things you don't have any control over, that will cause you more stress and pain. That's why you should try to focus on finding brighter future. I'm sure there is a good fit for you somewhere, so focus only on that.",

Not everyone feels that way. \n\nI would say that notion is sort of a waste of time to explore\u2014 so far as it is not immediately helpful to you in this circumstance.\n\nWhat if you spent 5 minutes a day doing the immediately helpful? Not thinking, just doing?\n\nWhen you\u2019re relaxed or almost asleep, where would the sadness be?\n\nI use relaxation as leveraging my imagination to relax. I relax and let go further and further. At some point in the exercise, I don\u2019t think it leverages imagination anymore, it just is relaxation.",

I can only encourage you to try a differnt journaling method.\n\nOtherwise you might try to look for a coach, like systemic coaching. They are not therapists, but might help you navigate your current situation till you can get therapy.",

Two books that really helped me are \"Love your self like your life depends on it\" by Kamar Ravikant and \"Man's Search for Meaning\" by \u200eViktor Frankl. I would highly advise you to give one of them a try, even though I was not someone who was willing to read, these books kinda opened my eyes.",

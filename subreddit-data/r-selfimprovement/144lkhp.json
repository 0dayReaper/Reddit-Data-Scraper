Especially if they're in their 30s. I find it immature and on the edge of being qualified of mentally ill. You can be a mature man and still have fun when you want. My man is 33, has his life together and is doing very well, with a serious job. But we're on a holiday now and day-drink, play in the pool like kids, and enjoy doing silly things. However, he's def not a man-child and if he was, he would have gotten zero interest from me. \n\nYou have been too much on one extreme and think going all the way over is the solution but this sounds ridiculous. Just my opinion.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, this is my first post here so if I break any rules I apologise in advance.\n\nTherapists are a scam. \n\nI had a session today after a while because I wasn\u2019t feeling great the past few days and other therapists in the area definitely weren\u2019t much help. I reach the therapist and I tell her about how I once got robber by someone I considered a friend. \nShe insisted on dwelling on the fact that it was a lot of money. She kept talking about the money. Didn\u2019t shut up about it honestly. \nWhen I said I didn\u2019t like the way she kept talking about my stolen cash, she said it was important for personal growth. \n\nReally? Mentioning a robbery over and over again because it was a lot of money, helps in personal growth? I\u2019ve already taken steps so that it doesn\u2019t happen again yet when I insisted that we stop talking about it, she didn\u2019t listen. \n\nI stormed out soon after and told her to have a nice evening and to forget that this session ever happened. The organisation where she works offers the first session for free so I didn\u2019t pay for anything. Not that the service was so exemplary.  Well anyway this is my 7th disappointing therapy session in a row. And I just needed to rant. If I\u2019m wrong then please feel free to let me know because that might actually aid in personal growth.",

I've gone through eight or nine myself. \n\nThe nature of therapy is very difficult because its purpose is to address the things that are upsetting us. And it is hard to talk about those things with some people because , well they're upsetting to us. \n\nNothing wrong with dumping your current therapist and finding a new one.",

If you express you don't want to talk about a certain aspect of it, that's what they'll probably focus on. Keep in mind you don't know what their intention is or what their education says to focus on. People talk to therapists about all sorts of horrible things without storming out. You need to accept that during the session you aren't going to be comfortable the whole time or talk about what you think needs to be talked about.",

Unfortunately, like someone in the comments said already, therapists are human like us and not all of them are going to be good.\n\nIt can take a while to find the right therapist for you, but I wouldn't give up. Therapy, when done right, is not a scam. There are some amazing therapists out there that can make a world of a difference.\n\nA lot of therapists offer a free meeting session so maybe keep trying these free consultations until you find someone that seems like a better fit. If you're open to it, a lot of therapists go virtual now so you may be able to look at a greater range of people if you're open to doing virtual appointments out of a different city.",

I AM SO GLAD I DIDNT GIVE UP!! My therapist is absolutely amazing and it would be fair to say that she\u2019s been a huge catalyst in my healing. Amazing therapists are out there but it takes some legwork finding them. I encourage you to keep an open mind and keep seeking. I wish you well.",

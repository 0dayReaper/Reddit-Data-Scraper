    "postText": "Luckily he last said this to me over 3 years ago, but yes it still stings just as much if not more to this day. He\u2019s always had a huge knack for teasing me, but of course always with a little tinge of seriousness under the \u201cjokes\u201d. Actually not too long ago I showed him my car and he was like \u201cwow it\u2019s super clean inside, that\u2019s super surprising\u201d. Stuff like that. \n\nIt\u2019s just discouraging because it feels like, no matter how much I externally organize myself or whatever tf he thinks I should do, I keep wondering if maybe I\u2019ll always be a slight slob or something, just basically below most peoples\u2019 standards and maybe this friend is the only one with the balls to tell me.\n\nEDIT: For some context. Basically a while ago, like 7ish years ago, we got this \"mankini\" (from Borat) and I tried it on as a joke. It was funny and all, but then fast forward to 3 years ago, we were reminiscing about that and this friend told me how he didn't want to try it on after me because, well, see title. I honestly thought that was kinda funny, but then he immediately asserted that I STILL seemed that type of guy, which stung that time because by then I'd definitely come a long way in just understanding hygiene since the first time. Some people around were kinda thrown off by it though, and someone even sort of defended me, but then the conversation changed really quick.",

I think he genuinely just possesses a lot of common sense and also isn\u2019t super sensitive himself (as far as I know), so therefore he finds my general lack of common sense both unusual and amusing so therefore he teases me / calls me out for it, also because he just doesn\u2019t really get the whole \u201csensitive\u201d part. \nThe overall point of my post I guess was to see if anyone has had something like this happen to them. Dealing with this friend is one thing, I\u2019m more just concerned with how his comment and others have affected my self image at this point. Like I said, it\u2019s frustrating that he probably still sees me as quite \u201cbelow\u201d him in lots of ways and it\u2019s hard to just let that shit go, especially when I\u2019m always trying to improve myself these days.",

We know at the end of the day when shit gets real we got each other's backs. \n2.) He's actually insulting you. Seems a bit far fetched to me if yall have been friends for that long but anything's possible. \n\nFrom there you have a couple options:\n1.) Ask him. Say you don't like some of the jokes his made and would like him to ease off. Depending on his reaction you can decide whether you want to continue being friends with him. \n2.) Cut him off. I'd argue this is a bit stupid to ruin a friendship over a joke you didn't like before at least conversing with him over it but it's your life and your choice.\n3.) Do nothing and continue to whine about it. This accomplishes nothing.",

A big theme for me as I\u2019ve been in therapy over the past few months is basically, as you could\u2019ve guessed, reflecting on moments where friends made me feel small for calling me out or teasing me in different ways. Unfortunately I\u2019m the type of person who constantly makes stupid mistakes, come across as kinda air-headed, plus add an array of other insecurities and you get someone who only thinks about his \u201ccriticisms\u201d. I know, it sounds stupid and maybe even pathetic, but tbh I\u2019m just sick of *constantly* dwelling on some comment or series of comments, it can get very overwhelming at times. Hence why I come to subreddits like these days, basically just to vent about (insert some friend) making me feel angry &amp; under appreciated. \n\nI have brought up stuff like this to my friend\u2014I guess my problem isn\u2019t being afraid to bring this stuff up, it\u2019s that I have trouble simply accepting that he\u2019s said so much stuff like this to me in general. I can confront him about it all I want, but that doesn\u2019t change what he thinks about me. So yes, I do care WAY too much about what he thinks of me. And then what? I can acknowledge that all day long but it doesn\u2019t change the crazy obsessions I still have about comments like these. I understand that my way of thinking is faulty rn but that doesn\u2019t make everything better. Hence why I whine on places like these sometimes.",

That's your choice to make so make it and stand firm on your position.

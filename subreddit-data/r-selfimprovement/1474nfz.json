    "postText": "I'm 20 and there's a lot I regret. I recently took up hobbies that I constantly beat myself up for not starting sooner. All I really did as a kid/teenager was play games all day, and I regret it so much. I can't help but wonder what my life could've been like if I started everything sooner, and I constantly tell myself no matter how much I try, I'll never be as good as someone who started earlier than me.\n\n  \nI know it's better to start now than later, but I keep wishing I did start sooner. I constantly feel anxious about time passing and how I'm \"running out of time\". There's so much I want to do but I feel overwhelmed about not having enough time to do them.\n\n  \nI see kids/teenagers doing what I wish I had done at their age, and I feel a bit jealous honestly, knowing they have so much free time and much more time to accomplish what they want, stuff like that. It's stupid I know, but I can't shake these thoughts out of my head.",

Whenever you take a peak at the past contemplate why xyz happen, you always do so with the mind you have today, at that time with the mind you had and the state of the world an event took place, no matter how many times you repeat it it will always happen same way, now 10 years from now when you look at this point in time same paradox, past is like a fog nothing to see there just baggage it left you with.\n\nFocus on present as  true world currency is Time how you use it determines who you are, being trapped into a vicious cycle just eats more of your time and there simply isn't enough.",

The sooner you realize this, the sooner you will stop wasting mental energy.\n\n If you\u2019re thinking about the past, you should think about the future as well. What if you continue thinking like this, would you be in the same spot when you\u2019re 30, or worse potentially?\n\nAssuming you did start sooner on whatever you\u2019re currently doing, you either 1. Would\u2019ve compared with someone else in a better spot and feel bad about yourself, or 2. You would\u2019ve just quit doing it after a week or 2 when you\u2019re a kid, because kids are not consistent with anything they do.",

Embrace it, you are learning life lessons and how to navigate life. With every difficult thing you learn more. Just pay attention and work on being and doing better. Don\u2019t numb yourself, go through it. That is what life is about. Don\u2019t be afraid. Take care of business. Take care of your people. Love yourself and work towards happiness. You are on the right path, just work hard and do your best. Travel when you can. Enjoy the beauty of life and remember to look around at the small things. You are never a failure, you just need to change your approach to life at points. Don\u2019t be afraid, you can achieve what you seek if you set your mind to it and don\u2019t let others tell you otherwise. I wish you the best of luck",

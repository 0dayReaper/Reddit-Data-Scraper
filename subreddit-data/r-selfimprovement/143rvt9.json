To do exhausting and stressful things for 8 hours strait and then do more exhausting and stressful things everyday afterward everyday isnt sustainable or good for you. Self improvement is for your own well being, or it should be. But people seem to make it 'if you dont work all the time on specific things that you dont like in almost all ways then you're a loser.\" Thats just not true. Do what makes you secure and every other goid emotion as much as you can. Avoid the things that make your life worse. it's contradictory to suffer so you dont suffer too so be mindful if that.",

Here are a few tips:  \nSet small, achievable goals.  \nEngage in activities you enjoy outside of work.  \nRead books or listen to podcasts on personal development.  \nPractice mindfulness or meditation.  \nSeek out new learning opportunities.  \nTake breaks and ensure you get enough rest.",

A part of self-improvement can be to learn how to get a different type of job and be attractive to whatever type of employers or customers or sponsors you want, that way you can work towards a different job that is maybe less demanding or more flexible or has an aspect about it that is inherently self-improving to you. So your future employment/ source of earning can be a major part of your personal self-improvement goals. Like multitasking",

            "comment": "Sometimes, the job is the problem, and one of the most impactful self improvement decisions you can make is to find a job that is not toxic and doesn't completely exhaust you.\n\nWhat part of your job is exhausing and what kind of exhaustion is it? Is it physical, social, emotional, psychological or a combination? Perhaps the line of work you chose for your summer job just isn't a good fit for you. Maybe it's not a good culture fit. Maybe it's your boss. Maybe the commute is draining. \n\nAlso, sometimes jobs can start out good, then the role slowly changes and the culture changes as the staff turns over and you don't even realize why you're so miserable because the changes were so slow. This happened to me recently. The changes at my job were slow and I was a bit like the frog in the slowly boiling pot of water. Realized I just can't do it anymore.\n\nThe job it'self isn't exhausing, but the commute and dynamic with my boss became intolerable over time. It took me way too long to realize it, and now I'm looking for something else, Just the act of looking has me feeling better and more energized.\n\nThe good news is that it sounds like this is a temporary summer job, so you do have an end point to look forward to. It will be a good learning experience of what to avoid in the future when you do get a permanent career. If you just started, I wouldn't recommend quitting unless you are coming home crying every day (I've been there and had to quit something after 2 weeks once).",

Slowly but surely though I was able to adapt and accomplish more and more things after/before work. I think it\u2019s just a shock to our system when we go from having an unstructured day to a day where you\u2019re literally stuck in one place from 9 to 5. Like other people have said, just start with something small and slowly build up from there. The last thing you want to do is burn yourself out",

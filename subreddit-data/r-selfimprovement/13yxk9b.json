    "postText": "Pretty much as the title says, I make good money compared to men my age, think 3-4 times even though I live in a developing country.\n\n\nI got my career in order aswell as my fitness, but the problem with me, is I'm terrible in social settings, I'm very socially awkward and it's like a knife twisting in me.. I am afraid I'd never be able to get with a girl, as every interaction with one gets me anxious, especially the attractive girls but the thing for me is, I'm really not into sleeping around and being a player... Even though I like most men would like sex with many women, but it will feel just empty and meaningless for me..\n\nI wonder if anyone here have went through it, cause I really would dislike a hoe phase and I'm a religious guy, and I take it seriously, so and this would be shocking for many here I would imagine, but in my culture, the first time you lose your virginity is with your wife, and I plan to do that\n\n\nDo you guys have any idea on what to do? I feel like if I don't get my social skills in order, I'd live a lonely life of silent depression.\n\nAlso I have to note that, I'm a software engineer who's working remotely at the moment, so I have veryyyy little social interactions already.\n\nWould appreciate any help, thanks",

So you will interact with people, you'll learn something new and if you find an interesting girl you will both have already something in common. Maybe it's art, or meditation or some sport. And if you don't find someone at first don't worry, at least you can practice your social skills. I have found some good friends doing that.",

But since I saw this thread,\n\nAll I can say is to get rid of your social awkwardness try using a dating app .. it's not like you have to get someone from there but you can practice by having conversations with random strangers... I think that can help you well if you have a good conversation and a little experience with girls ..\n\nAlso, It's your que to listen to these song - \n* Cupid (twin ver)\n* Lonely (akon) \nEnjoy !",

Don't know if I'm saying it right but I think that as long as you are happy being yourself in a social environment, that's the connection that you seek. Unfortunately, we cannot connect with every single person we meet when everybody has unique depths of identity within themselves and interests. I am also struggling with this very much.\nBut whenever I have the greatest sense of self is when I am the happiest.",

All men need a group of \"Bros\" so you just need to make some lifr changes and you are going to be fine!\n\n2-Don't just enroll to a gym to do weights. Bc the thing about doing weights is that unless you alredy go with friends, you are on your own. Go to a class!!! Like crossfit! Or martial arts. (I did both by the way). For example, Go to a kickboxing class and tell the instructor you don't know nothing about it but you want to learn the basics to defend yourself. be honest. People are going to include you.\nThere's tons of activities and classes: paddle, tennis, crossfit, trekking groups, climbing, football, language conversation groups, etc etc etc..... a ton! Pro tip: there is more proportions of ladys on dance classes and theater classes.=p\n\n-You are going to suck at first! Don't worry we all been there. And you are not trying to compete or something...\n\n3- Don't expect to make instant friends! It's going to be a process. Especially if you are an introvert. Men sometimes make instant friends but this is not allways the case.\n\n4- There is absolutely another guy in your city in the same situation! Go to a facebook group of software engineers and post: hey! Unrelated topic .. I'm looking for someone to go to a gym with. 20 to 30 years old..In x city. Ask them to D M you! Go to the gym, talk to the people at the reception the instructor would take care of the rest. He/she is going to teach you to exercise. Also, if you go to the gym always go at the same hour and the same days. break the ice. Say hi to people. Eventually you end up knowing someone. And making a gym buddy.\n\n5- A lot of young guys think they are introverts when in fact they just didn't socialize enough to feel comfortable on social situations. So, push your limits. You are more than you think you are.\n\n6-Travel! (if you can) If you come to Argentina or Brazil there's no way you don't end up with new friends! =p When you travel you are going to meet new people.\n\nPs. Yeah....! I know, my english sucks!\n\nSincerely! A guy who used to be in your same situation!",

The more you do it, the easier it gets. \n\nYou mention you are religious, why not try to find a like minded girl with the same morals and values in your place of worship or something related to that. It\u2019s easier to meet people in congregation settings because others can introduce you to someone if you let them know you are looking. Hope that helps and good luck with everything :)",

Society often puts pressure on us to live a certain way. If we all have the same kind of life, how will we ever celebrate every person's uniqueness?\n\nComing to loneliness, i have been in the same boat. And now people get attracted to me as i worked on myself. \nThe thing is, the world is a mirror.\n\nA mirror of what exactly, you may ask?\nIt is a mirror of your thoughts, feelings and beliefs. The more anxious this makes you, you are more likely to attract the same situation. \n\nWhen you are around people, try shifting your focus. Currently you may be focusing on stuff like - what should I say next ? Am i sounding ok ? Did i say something stupid?\nEtc etc\n\nHere are few things you can start doing to shift your focus \n1. Focus on having a good time and enjoying\n2. Notice beauty around you. Example, can be a beautiful tree, a car, anything you like\nYou cannot be both, anxious and present in the moment at the same time\n3. Be comfortable with yourself. If you don't feel like talking to people and want to be quiet, so be it. As long as you are comfortable, people will sense that vibe\n4. Focus on what makes you special. Don't go by society's standards of what you should be\n\nAs you shift your focus and energy people will automatically sense the vibe and start feeling attracted to you\n\nTo know more about how to deal with anxiety and attain inner peace, do consider following the below insta page :\n\nyour_inner_growth_journey\n\nYou've got this! More power to you!",

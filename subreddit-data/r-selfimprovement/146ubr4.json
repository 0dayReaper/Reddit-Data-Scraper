    "postText": "I went through some pain these past few weeks and that pain made me lose all motivation and optimism. Because of that most days these past few weeks I have just been lying in bed and ruminating/ self pitying. I knew while I was in the moment that there would be a time when I would be out of the funk, and that I would be angry at myself for letting it get to me and affect me so much.\n\nWell now I am pretty much out of the funk and being productive again and I look back at myself and think how \u201cweak\u201d I was and how \u201ceasy\u201d it was to come out of that state.\n\nBecause I\u2019m better now I just think that it must have been always easy to climb out of that place in my mind and that I was just holding myself back. And I know it wasn\u2019t easy to, I know you can\u2019t control feelings and sometimes you have to let time heal you. \n\nBut how can I stop the other side of my brain from attacking myself and saying that I wasted so much time for something that was so \u201ceasy\u201d to jump out of? When the other rational half knows it\u2019s natural?",

When I get back, I have to study for a license test that I have around two years to complete. I want to grind the most down on that before September which is when my job starts.\n\nBasically, what I\u2019m saying is what are some quick and, potentially easy, ways to keep myself above $1,000, or even more, before entering the workforce three months from now while also not spending as much on food?",

    "postText": "Hello, my name is Mary and I'm 19. I stopped giving second chances to my toxic ex. I will be really happy, if my story helps or encourages someone to end their toxic relationship. \n\nIt all started when we were only in elementary school. I was a theater kid and participated in a lot of school plays. I was cleaning up the chairs after play, and then, suddenly, a girl came up to me. As a shy kid, I was really scared of talking to people face to face, but this girl seemed so nice... She asked if I wanted to be a friend with her, and I said yes. I gave her my phone number, and asked her if she wanted to meet tomorrow after school.\n\nThis was the biggest mistake I've made. \n\nAs the time went by, I started to notice, that she acted kind of weird when I was around. Almost like she was interested in me. But, as you probably guessed, I felt the same way. \n\nIn 2017, I finally asked her if she wanted to be with me. She said yes.\n\nWe were like one of those \"perfect\" couples. I loved her more than everything, and she did too. We were together 24/7 and never got tired of each other.\n\nBut couple of years ago it all changed.\n\nIt was almost the end of an another school year. Sun was shining, birds were singing, we were just casually texting each other. And then, suddenly she started complaining about her grades, parents, mental state. I started to worry about her, because she was suicidal. But when I asked her about the way she felt, she just said that everything is ok and she's just a bit tired. \n\nThen, she started regularly complaining about her life, and soon, our chat started to look like that:\n\nMon\n\nMe: Heyyy, is everything ok? You haven't texted me in the past two days\n\nHer: Yeah, I'm alright... Just wanted to take a break from the social media.\nI'm getting kinda depressed tho\n\nM: What do you mean you're alright? Being depressed is not ok in any way. \nDo you need any help?\n\nH: No.\n\nM: Alrighty then, see ya tomorrow.\nI love you\n\n\n\nTue\n\nH: Ugh, i can't take this anymore...\n\nM: What when why\n\nH: Got a B for a history test.\n\nM: YOU GOT A B? OMG IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!! THAT TEST WAS REALLY HARD\n\nH: I fucking hate myself for being so dumb.\n\nM: Wh... You aren't dumb. Why are you saying that?\n\nH: Why are you always trying to help me? Those are only my problems and I don't want to solve them.\n\nM: Okay. But then, please, stop complaining about them.\nThere's no point of complaining, when you do nothing to solve the problems.\n\nH: You don't want to hear about my problems?\nI knew that you don't care about me.\n\nM: What did you just said?\n\nH: You never thought of me.\n\nM: Why are you making me a guilty one?\nI'm always here to help you.\n\n\n\nWed\n\nM: Good morning, sweetheart\nHow's it going?\n\nH: Yk what?\n\nM: What?\n\nH: I don't really want to live after 30 y. o.\n\nM: Wait, what? Why are you always telling me that? I've said a lot of times that it really hurts to hear all this stuff from your close one.\n\nH: Oh, well... You don't care about the way I feel?\n\n\nAnd so on.\nEveryday.\nEvery morning, day and night, I felt an insane amount of guilt, shame and embarrassment. She always said that I didn't love her enough. From the person I loved the most, she turned into literal pain in the ass.\nBut the worst part of it is that I just couldn't stop it, because I loved her. \n\nAnd now, when I just had a breakdown on a breakdown, I finally decided to end it all. I texted her that I wanted to seriously talk to her. I've said all the stuff I wanted to say all these years. And, when she made me cry for a 3rd time while I was talking to her, I sent the message.\nI immediately felt relieved.\nBut, her respond was like a tap on back.\n\"Wanna go? Okay. You haven't loved me anyway. I knew it.\"\n\nI know, that this is just a manipulation, but that still hurts.\n\nAnd now, when I'll be done with this post, I will return all the gifts she gave me. I just want it to end as soon as possible. \n\n\nIt's never too late to get out of an abusive relationship.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m very sorry for what happened to you. My story was pretty similar. It was also with a girl called Mary and generally speaking we were also a perfect couple, exactly like you two were. But my story kind of mixes these to perspectives into one. After a few months of that relationship I became depressed(I don\u2019t think that it was because of her at all) our texts looked also at some point similar but like I never said that she doesn\u2019t love me etc. We both had some doubts if the other one loves them but I suppose it\u2019s pretty understandable because we were together for just a few months and we loved each other so much that we were each other\u2019s whole world. At some point she became completely uninterested in me etc. She got pretty mean, she started looking at me like at a stranger whom she hated etc. It was unimaginably painful and it was the hardest time of my life(depression + heartbreak) and one day I just said \u201cWe can\u2019t make sense together, bye, sorry\u201d. I know that I\u2019m not innocent in this story but I think that none of us is. There were many other things connected to it but I don\u2019t see the point in writing them here. Also if somehow she is reading this I just want to tell you that I\u2019m sorry and that I love you still a bit. If they are telling the truth you love him now and I don\u2019t have a problem with that(if you care about it) and that I just want you happy whether it is or isn\u2019t with me. Thank you for all you these beautiful times.",

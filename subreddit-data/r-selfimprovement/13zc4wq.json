    "postText": "So I quite recently had a breakup which happend a little over a month ago. The problem is that she's in the same student association as I am. I'd really like to join those parties, but the chance that she's there is almost guaranteed. Yesterday I was at a party of the association and she was there as well. Even worse, she was dating someone again and I saw them kiss. This kind of messed me up after some time, but I wonder if I should stop going to those parties if it hurts me. I want to go because I want to be there and I don't want to have to skip them purely because she is there, but at the same time it can cause me some distress. Would it be best to just skip it entirely or just keep going? Perhaps I learn to handle it better by facing it more, I dunno.",

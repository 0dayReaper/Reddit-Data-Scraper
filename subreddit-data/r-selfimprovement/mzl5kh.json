The key is to never lose the quitting mindset.  \n\nI had to try, fail, rinse repeat a few times before I finally quit.  \n\nIt is possible.",

The longest I\u2019ve ever gone without a single one. My mindset has shifted from \u201cI need to quit to save money\u201d to \u201cI need to quit so I can feel better\u201d and guess what? The extra money feels more like a reward for becoming a better version of myself than trying to save money from not smoking and having the health benefits be the reward. \n\nMy advice is track it with an app and replace that spent time on a hobby or something you can see growth in. Maybe buy a plant. \n\nDay 111, 2,225 cigarettes not smoked, $1,666 saved!\n\nYou got this :)",

Plain and simple. People will laugh and not take you seriously, but those are the people who do not want to see you succeed and will rather make you as miserable as they are. Just keep this attitude, accept it and live as if this thing will instantly kill you no matter what. Do we question the pains and urges that you we get after recovering from a surgery? Of course not, doctor told you that it will happen and it will pass, so we just keep waiting. That was my mindset for fasting (\"if I eat now, I'll die\" ) and it worked out great - in fact, I'm still doing it even without needing it. And remember: by doing this, you are BETTER. Better than other people? Hard to say, that's almost impossible to answer, but you are surely way better than your previous version! You're now completely on the right to look back and say \"God, what I was thinking!\". And BTW, the freedom! No more dependency, no more money wasted, no more health issues! That's so much space for improvement! Be proud of yourself and kick this addiction in the ass like the badass that you are!",

My best advice is to truly pause to take moments to see how your body is feeling, and how different it is!

Best thing to remember is that every time you push yourself and go a day without falling back into old habits, you've grown and you have to acknowledge that because that takes real fucking strength! Congratulate yourself for every day you push yourself and grow. Self love is the key to this game. Best of luck bro :)",

Super proud of you.\n\nI'm listening to an audio book called Atomic Habits right now that you may find helpful in your journey. \n\nOne of the points the author mentions is that there are two camps of folks adjusting their habits - - those who say \"no thanks, I'm trying to quit\" who still identify as smokers, and those who say \"no thanks, I'm not a smoker,\" incorporating their new, healthier identity into their life. You are no longer a smoker. You are a healthy person.\n\nAuthor suggests there's three layers of behavior change. On the outside is outcomes. Ultimately you want to not smoke. That is your outcome. \n\nThere is the middle layer, processes. It's how you achieve that. You've thrown your cigarettes out, maybe you've got a roommate to hold you accountable. \n\nThe innermost layer is identity. The best way to implement change in your life is to view it as a change in the group(s) you identify with. you are no longer a smoker. You are a healthy person. If you're ever questioning if you're on the right path, ask yourself what someone else with that identity would do. What would a healthy person do?\n\nEMBODY IT! CHECK OUT THE BOOK, IT'S AMAZING!",

I also went thru the same and the mind will play its worst tricks on you, the worst for me was imagining a future without ever having a cigarette, then I stopped looking at the future and focused as much as possible on right now, what matters is right now, the rest will follow. Good luck stay strong!!!",

I remember counting the days helped a lot in not relapsing especially when I got to day 50. Keep going and never give up on living a much more healthier lifestyle.

Make this a religious thing ( it needs a bit of practice) : when you have a strong urge don't let yourself act illogically for a short period for one time, not for a second. always have this debate : If I smile I'll create more bad feelings like this urge and I will go back to this same spot next time I try to quit + I do wanna smoke but I won't enjoy it and I will really down if I do (imagine yourself smoking using that memory) \n\nIt worked for me :)",

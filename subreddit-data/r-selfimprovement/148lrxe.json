    "postText": "i have little to no attention span unless i'm doing/watching something i'm very interested in. i am impulsive and, as a result, i sometimes behave in a way that's embarrassing to look back on.\n\n\nmy lack of an attention span is stopping me from catching up on missed education and learning. i lose stuff way too often, including what i need to teach myself things. i'm permanently skim reading which often leads me to miss questions out on exams or misunderstand the question because i can't slow down and actually read what i'm meant to.\n\n\nmy impulsiveness i feel is wrecking my social skills. if a thought enters my brain, i act on it. i can keep myself from doing stupid stuff with effort but if my guard slips or i forget about it, i act stupidly. i don't think about what i'm doing. sometimes i act before i even register how i'm supposed to respond. this makes it look like i've misread people, which sometimes leads to really uncomfortable situations lol, but really i just act without actually processing what i've been told until a second or two later. i feel too awkward to correct myself lmao. a lot of that could be bc im never fully focusing on ppl too ig\n\n\ni want to catch up on the years of education i've missed but i don't know how to get past this. i want to learn a bunch of stuff. i've tried meditation but i only manages to do that a few days before forgetting about it and feeling veryy reluctant to do it.",

            "comment": "Dude, I feel you with the lack of attention span and impulsiveness. It can be a challenge, but here's a tip: try using the Forfeit app. It's this cool app where you set goals for yourself, and if you don't complete them and provide evidence within a certain time, you lose a bit of cash.\" It adds a bit of accountability and motivation to stay on track with your tasks, like studying or getting stuff done.\r Also, find ways to make learning more engaging. Look for interactive resources, like online courses with quizzes and exercises, or watch educational videos that grab your attention. And break your learning into smaller chunks to make it more manageable. Don't stress too much, take it step by step, and the progress will come. Good luck!",

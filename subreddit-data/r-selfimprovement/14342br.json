    "postText": "I'm 20f and I care way too much about milestones and things like that. What age I am when I accomplish things, it makes me feel anxious like I'm running out of time. I feel as though the older you get, the less impressive accomplishments will be. I've never had a relationship which I also feel bad about. \n\nI have an age insecurity in general, I tend to see a celebrity/someone with success and look up how old they are and I feel bad when they're younger than me. I also just see people younger than me in relationships, or doing things I wish I had done at their age and I didn't pick up till I was 18+ (hobbies like guitar or working out) I don't know how to stop these anxiety and insecurities, it feels so draining.",

    "postText": "I've never been in any relationship, never been on a date (26M) I have been turned down in every way shape or form, Im short and not good looking my brother is the exact opposite and a constant reminder of how bad my situation is. I have tried every dating app possible I have never matched with anybody. My friends have all been in or are in relationships. I know they say you have to love yourself first before someone can love you, but I have loved myself for so long with nobody else loving me I can no longer love me, I hate myself now. And every where I go I see just how lonely I have always been.",

Apart from it I go to park and relax.  You will find that you don't need to compare yourself, and you will also experience the stuff you want to do just that it takes time and patience.  It's just that some people have it easy and some work very hard.  I have a friend who has a gf and both are very happy and whereas I am single. Just get busy with other stuff, and this will also come in your life.  I have developed friendships with people, and I am happy and hopefully will develop into gf. That's okay if it doesn't. TLDR: just get busy with stuff and keep trying.  Everything takes its time.",

Go out and party, go meet some people at a couple festivals. find something you love todo in a place that seems out of place for you and you'll be surprised how many people you'll find things in common with. Just put yourself out there in every way possible without having any expectations and it will come.",

Maybe some that might go over your head if you don't know the cues. I bartended for a long time and got a ton of hits from all kinds of girls even from some i definitely didn't want attention from. If you are behind the scenes it might be tough. i've washed dishes before and you really can't be seen as anything other than a worker because of social standards. try thinking situational when something funny or crazy happens on the floor and use that as a starting point for conversation or jokes. If you can make someone laugh that will definitely give you a huge advantage. if you can't do that it's going to make your life alot harder. Stop thinking about hating yourself over it and stop rushing yourself, you don't need to be completely in love with yourself to find someone but you can't be so pessimistic either as to where it's going to keep you in a rut.",

But you're right being pessimistic is not helping me, appreciate your advice!",

Ask for their number, what they're doing for the weekend/ next/ talk about some events you're interested and ask if they'd be interested in joining. Good luck!",

You have to remember you\u2019re loved, build a support system of friends who Rally behind you and people will tend to notice that. We all naturally gravitate towards positivity. So I know right now it\u2019s hard, but take your time, be active, and get involved in new things. All it takes is a new experience to find people who will recognize what you bring to the table, and they\u2019ll feel blessed to have you",

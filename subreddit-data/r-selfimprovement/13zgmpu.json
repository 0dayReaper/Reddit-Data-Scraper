    "postText": "\nI understand we all have to work and definitely can't rely on family. Im in my mid-20s but idk what's preventing me from doing anything. I want to get a job but due to anxiety and lack of social skills, having insecurities and shyness. Im avoiding myself from applying. I wish I can find remote jobs. I previously used to work at fast food and retail jobs but due to customer service, I just got really nervous and anxious. I thought I push myslef to work like those jobs in hopes to overcome shyness but negative experience is putting me in a bubble once again. I don't know how I will live life if I'm constantly in the zone of anxiety and overthinking. This is ruining my own life. I don't know how to overcome this barrier. It's preventing me from trying new things, working on my goals, overcoming fears. Sighs I'm so stuck and I can't blame nobody but me.",

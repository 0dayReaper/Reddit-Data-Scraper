    "postText": "I have been doing better. I now have a job which doesn't suck for me. Things have been better. I have been working out 4-5x a week in the gym. Been eating better. Gained some weight. Haven't smoked for 3 months now. But I still feel uneasy all the time. Like there's no rest. There is always this anxiety and something going on in my head which makes me feel heavy all the time. My mind and thoughts stay cloudy. I keep overthinking. I want to feel better and happy but everyday is the same. Does it always stay the same for some people or does it ever get better. It's been years but this won't change.",

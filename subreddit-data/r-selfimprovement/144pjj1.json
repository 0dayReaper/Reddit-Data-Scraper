    "postText": "I'm an 18 year old guy. I used to be a productive person about a year or two ago, but all that went away when I faced a problem in my life (not gonna talk about it here since I'm sure Reddit isn't gonna help with it), I'm doing better at dealing with it but I'm still struggling a little. \n\nThose one or two years that I spent with that problem have made me a lazy, non productive person who spends so, so much time on his phone and on the computer on useless stuff mostly. And my attention span is not doing too well. I want to change that.\n\nI have a list of things I want to do, such as read a few books I have in mind, workout, improve on my hobbies, fix my sleep schedule, and other things. I'll say that it seems incredibly difficult to do these things, but I want to do them all on a daily basis (except workout, every 2 days instead). What do I do? How do I get myself to work on myself more?\n\nFinally, 2 notes:\n\n1- That problem mentioned above is still present, and might affect my progress, but I'll try my best to deal with it and get rid of it.\n\n2- I don't want to completely get off social media, I still got people I want to text and not kick out of my life as we can only text right now.\n\nThanks for reading.",

I need to send an screenshot of my screen time with both these apps with less than 2 hours of usage combined per day, or i lose $20. It really keeps me on track since i don\u00b4t have enough money to lose right now lol",

It is a powerful motivator, yet a scary one. \n\nAlthough, good job on fighting your addiction! Hope you can continue to fight this addiction and win!",

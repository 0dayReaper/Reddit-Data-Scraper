    "postText": "I feel like one of the biggest pillars of self improvement is physical wellness. My diet is great, I don\u2019t drink or smoke, but I get viscerally frustrated, agitated, and irritated when I work out. I get really frustrated if I feel I am not doing something right, or preforming an exercise to the best of my ability. So much so that I\u2019d rather not workout and just sit there in my anger. It\u2019s been this way for years. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore, because I know I should workout. Any tips for me?",

You can restrict a show or podcast you enjoy to only when you are walking, on the treadmill, or working out. I only let myself watch gaming streams when I\u2019m exercising. I feel like if you\u2019re focusing on that show/podcast/whatever you already enjoy, you will focus less on the perfection of your workout, since it will be secondary.\n\nAlso, something I remind myself is that no matter how little or half-assed I workout, something is always better than nothing. When I\u2019m feeling especially tired or lazy I remember that I have never ever regretted a workout in my life and have always felt getter after getting through it.",

            "comment": "Stick to simple, easy-to-do exercise movements and only do exercises that you LIKE doing. Consistency is the most important thing when it comes to working out and especially bodybuilding. Also watch form videos on every exercise you\u2019re doing to ensure you are doing it correctly.  Watch those \u201c9 DO\u2019s AND DONT\u2019s OF DUMBBELL PRESSES\u201d and videos like that. They tend to have useful tips on form and just watch them on 2x speed to save time (DO THIS FOR ALL MOVEMENTS). Even if an exercise looks straight forward there may be something small to keep in mind to prevent injury. Like tucking your elbows in a bit, etc.\n\nThe time you spend researching this is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of time you will be doing the exercise. You should be sticking with the same workout routine for many months anyways. \n\nIf you just don\u2019t enjoy working out at all then I think it helps to envision your goal physique. Just imagine every rep/set as you laying down a brick to building your dream physique.\n\nGood luck.",

Your new goal should be to stay consistent for 30 days. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of free apps (I use dumbbells). Just get through the routine every day and consider completion your goal.\n\nYou can improve your form as you build your strength. You\u2019ll notice a physical change within that 30 days just by getting through the routines whether you\u2019re doing things perfect or not. Then you can look to improve from there.\n\nI\u2019d recommend supplementing with creatine too if you\u2019re open to that. It will help build strength and muscle faster.",

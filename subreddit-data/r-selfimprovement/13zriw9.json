    "postText": "I've been lavishing my niece and nephew with generous gifts for years: gaming consoles, iPhones, iPads, and fashionable clothes \u2014 the things their mother can't afford. As their mother is divorced and lacks support, I felt obligated to step in. Plus, as someone who grew up in poverty, I find joy in providing them the luxuries I didn't have.\r  \n\r  \nBut I've been disheartened recently. Their gratitude seems to be waning, particularly from the 13-year-old who has adopted a disrespectful attitude towards his mother, developed a smoking habit, and displays no interest in school. His belief that my success is merely the result of luck deeply troubles me. I want them to realize that life isn't a breeze; my escape from poverty and attainment of success are products of relentless effort, calculated risks, and a resolute mindset.\r  \n\r  \nThis summer, they'll be visiting me, and I hope to influence them positively and impart valuable life lessons. I'd like to strike a balance, mixing fun experiences like trips to Disneyland with more serious discussions that inspire a sense of self-reliance and a drive to push boundaries. I'm preparing a series of topics and conversations to this end and would value your help in fleshing these out and arranging them effectively. I'd also appreciate any impactful words or experiences you could share.\r  \n\r  \nHere are the topics I'd like to delve into:\r  \n\r  \nBalancing Fun and Responsibility: I want to underscore the importance of relishing life while recognizing the efforts that underpin it.\r  \n\r  \nPersonal Vision and Potential: I aim to instill in them the belief in their own capabilities, accentuating the unique strengths I observe in each.\r  \n\r  \nTransience of Good Times: I intend to make them understand that nothing lasts forever, and they should seize opportunities while they're available.\r  \n\r  \nStopping Gifts: I plan to discuss my decision to cease giving lavish gifts, and elucidate my reasons for it.\r  \n\r  \nGratitude and Appreciation: I wish to emphasize how lucky they are to have someone who cares about them and to express the importance of not taking it lightly.\r  \n\r  \nSetting Goals: I'll encourage them to set their own objectives, for example, getting certain grades at school to earn future vacations with me.\r  \n\r  \nMoreover, I need them to understand that if their disrespectful behavior towards their mother and my disappointment in them persist, I may decide to spend my time with my other nephews who value my efforts.\r  \n\r  \nPlease feel free to expand on these topics or propose others. Also, if you have any personal experiences of powerful words that have shaped your life, I'd be grateful if you could share them.",

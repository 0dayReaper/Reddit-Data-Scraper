    "postText": "  \nIsn\u2019t this so very well said?  \nI, like everyone else, have gone through a lot my whole life. But my reactions, my behaviour, my nature has remained almost the same in each of those situations, and hence the consequence too has been the same always \u2014 anger, anxiety, frustration, hatred and to be honest, this never actually led to a wise solution too.  \nAn year ago, if you ask me, the same situations I went through, and my anger, anxiety only worsened it, it never actually helped me gain any insight to any solution.  \nBut today, I can say, being conscious of my actions, my behaviour, my way of handling problems &amp; situations has totally changed. The way I look at problems has changed. And this has brought about so much freedom within, almost as if like NOW, I can say that I am in charge of my life.   \nToday, I read this below quote bySadguru:  \n\u201cEspecially if unpleasant things have happened in your life, you should become wise, not wounded.\u201d  \nAnd this led me to ponder \u2014 that this is so true!  \nThe situations should make us wise in some way, that if some similar situation is put before us, we should be able to handle it in a way that should lead us to a solution and not another problem.  \nWhat do you think?",

    "postText": "So I started using Bumble to start dating girls, and I found this really cute girl whom I vibed with a lot. After a few days we switched to Insta to talk more. She was busy most of the days so we couldn't find a free time to meet. \n\nAnyways I noticed after 2-3 weeks that whenever we used to chat on Insta, all she used to talk about is how stressful her work is, how rude her boss is, how she is managing most of the company's work etc etc.\nAnd I used to spend time consoling or listening to her and that's how most of the chats went. After she finished venting, she used to disappear (without saying goodbye). She didn't even read my last few msgs and then she comes up again 2-3 days later saying 'Hey watsup, how you doing' and then repeat cycle.\n\nIt got really frustrating after a point and when she came back again after 3 days saying 'Hey watsup!' ignoring my last msgs I was like 'Nope I am done' and I told her that I get it she is busy, but she shouldn't ignore my last msgs and disappear randomly without saying goodbye only to appear a few days later. And that I don't wish to talk to her anymore. She said 'I am busy and I have work etc etc but if you don't wish to talk it's fine'\n\nI kind of felt bad but I am a guy who has low self-worth who is building his self-esteem little by little and starting to establish what is right or wrong for me and this was a huge step in this direction. I may have appeared a bit of an asshole but I had to do it because I need to start putting myself and what I want, first.",

Some people are inherently pessimistic, and can complain and focus so narrowly on something in their own life that their negative energy can impact others emotionally as well. Hope you find someone a bit more positive and interested in an actual relationship/getting to know and meet you",

She\u2019d do this same sort of stuff, then tell me \u201cyour issues are too stressful for me to handle right now\u201d after weeks of nothing but her drama. Even after we broke up (more accurately she ditched my for a bigger dock and bigger paycheck, but told me she stilled expected me to be an emotional booty call for her) she kept trying this. Only got worse when my replacement eventually left when he couldn\u2019t handle her particular brand of crazy. But that\u2019s a whole different story. \n\nBest thing I ever did was cut her out every where possible. My mental health got so much better after that.",

Also, you seem to be basing your entire self worth on what women think and \"not getting sex\". I hope you realise those are not things that define who you are. There's so much more to a person than if the opposite sex finds them desirable.\n\n I saw that you're in college and go to therapy. That's good. You're trying to improve yourself. If the people around you are telling you things that enable your twisted way of thinking, then that's the next thing you have to change. \n\nGood luck, stranger! I sincerely hope you get better and find your way and get rid of all this anger.",

It\u2019s also a really dysfunctional way to have a conversation, so we set ourselves up to lose if we ONLY chat via text while getting to know the other person. Try this- start with a SHORT text convo and if it goes well after a few back and forths then bump up the stakes and ask for a zoom or face call. This does a few things: it weeds out the BSers, liars, and also the catfishes, then it bypasses the potential for misunderstandings that happens all the time over text, and it creates a slightly more intimate convo because now you can hear and see each other. It\u2019s a date minus the outing. But keep this short because this is just to see if you jive enough to go out in person. If after a five or ten minute call it seems to be going well, then ask her out. Then wait til the date to talk again- because you don\u2019t wanna over invest in them until you actually know you have chemistry, and you also wanna save some convo for the date!  But yeah, do not date via text. That has SO many ways to go wrong and it\u2019s a lot harder to vet people.",

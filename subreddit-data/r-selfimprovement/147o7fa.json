    "postText": "So I'm 41 years old and I've decided that it's time to finish my degree that I started back in 2009 - and never finished. I've been to college a handful of times and never finish. Now with the economy being as bad as it is, I need to make a change and secure my future. I've had lots of jobs and some supervisory positions which paid a bit more, but I've never really felt financially free or completely financially stable. It seems I'm always struggling. I can't wait to finish this degree finally. I can get an associates in about 16 months (due to credits transferring from past) and then my bachelor's. I will most likely stop at a bachelor's due to my age. \n\nIt's also a really good time to go to school right now because my day job MAKES ME BORED OUT OF MY SKULL. It doesn't stimulate my mind at all. I'm overqualified for it, but since I don't have that little piece of paper called a college degree, I can't move up within my organization. \n\nIt's time to take my life in my own hands and stop letting lack of education hold me back!",

Especially if work leaves you feeling under stimulated or isn\u2019t fulfilling. Bachelor\u2019s is a huge milestone and sets people up for success, however, if you enjoy what you study and money/time isn\u2019t an issue: consider your masters! I only have a BS but am strongly considering a law degree or MBA. Not sure which yet. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure it out and do great regardless.",

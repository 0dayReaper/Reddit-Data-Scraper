It's this app i use where you commit to completing a task or goal and if you don't provide evidence of completing it, you lose some money. It adds a bit of accountability and might give you that extra push to get things done.\r  \n\r  \nIn addition to that, it might be worth exploring some self-care activities that can help lift your spirits. Try incorporating small daily habits like going for a walk, listening to uplifting music, or practicing mindfulness. And remember, you don't have to face this alone. Sometimes just talking it out with someone who understands can make a world of difference.",

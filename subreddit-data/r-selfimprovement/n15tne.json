When we talk about something we would like to accomplish, we get an endorphin boost. \nThis causes us subconsciously to believe that we are closer to our goal, without any action. I've been losing a lot of weight recently, and knowing this has helped me a lot. \nI think people talk about their goals because they want encouragement or guidance, which is fine in itself, but detrimental if done too much. Grinding in silence is tough, but worthwhile. \nLet the results speak for themselves.",

Learn about \"interocepting\" and calmly investigating body cues without further panicking.\n\nResources over at r/ResponsibleRecovery are just fantastic. You can cope better with strategies and practice, you can empower yourself to overcome your childhood trauma.\n\nI had 2 emotional flashbacks today and miraculously pulled through by really accepting my immense pain and by allowing myself to re-experience it. You can reduce intensity and duration of symptoms by actively participating in re-engineering thought and feeling.

Other people just destroy your interests and ambitions.\n\nEveryone has an opinion on things and even if you think that you want to share your hobby or anything with friends and family stop and just don\u2018t do it.\nYou expect a reaction and some people are plain asshole thinking it\u2018s constructive to tell you that what you\u2018re doing is shit.\n\nKeep it to yourself and one day you may show it but until then just enjoy",

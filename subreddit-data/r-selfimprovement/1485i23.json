    "postText": "I am just not able to sleep properly and early even though I haven\u2019t slept properly the night before. Let me give an example- I slept around 3am on Sunday night , did not get a restful sleep and woke up at 7 am for my new yoga class. I didn\u2019t sleep afterwards. I also did some cardio, went to work, climbed 5 floors to my house for cardio, had an early dinner and tried to sleep at 10. But I just wasn\u2019t able to sleep. I suddenly had to get up at 12 and eat something coz I felt very hungry, even though I had eaten before sleeping. Then I kept wanting to wake up for my yoga class in the morning but I just felt so tired. \nThis is not the first time it has happened. I have been having sleep issues for years now and I don\u2019t know how to resolve them. I have tried melatonin tabs and other natural recipes but they just don\u2019t work. I also don\u2019t have any physical health issues which prevent me from sleep. \nPlease help me.",

The best method I see is just do something you like till you are exhausted.. I usually take up a novel to read till I feel exhausted and sleep automatically..some other times I just keep gaming till I won't be able to keep my eyes open anymore..if you can't sleep just do something else. Worrying about not getting enough sleep will only make it worse..act like you are normal and your body will get back to normal on its own.",

I noticed working out in the evenings is impacting the quality of sleep. So i changed my workout schedule to mornings and I get up irrespective of how late I went to bed.\n2. Finish your dinner early. Maintain a 3-4 gap between dinner and your time to bed. If you are hungry, have a glass of milk or plain oats in milk. My nutritionist advised me this, and it worked very well.\n3. The most obvious one is no screentime before bed. Its still a work in progress for me.\n4. Having a clear mind and not getting engulfed in too many thoughts. I know it's not easy and i am still fighting it. Reading a book before bed instead of screentime helped me.",

Don't worry about 'non-sleep', you'll fall asleep if your body needs rest. The reason why I can't sleep is because I keep thinking about one thing or another. Nsdr keeps my brain in line and stops it from thinking a lot, and then I just fall asleep generally. The video I use is 30 minute yoga nidra for deep rest by ally boothroud. Do give it a try, follow all instructions and just relax. Hope it works.",

    "postText": "firstly I've been trying to lose weight almost since 8th grade, I've been overweight since i was a kid. Got bullied and everything just the usual fat kid stuff.\nNow im 19 and i still keep failing to be consistent with the genre. I do alot of research about weight lose, like you could imagine since 8th grade... so like many years and not just that, self improvement too. I have no skill i have nothing, academically i get avg and forget all the subject after exam is done(im doing BBA) so like im just a dump on this earth. I have no beauty nor brains (although i do believe I've got lil brains ofc, and good personality) \nWith all the research i put it all together that i just lack self discipline and it's all habits habits everything issa habit. Ik what i need to do with the weight lose but it's just soo hard. I'm also depressed (not intense) i can fall back real quick and im sad most of the time. I barely get guys (I trained my brain to make peace w it but it still bothers me ofc, all my friends are in a v loving relationship, and me who never felt it)\nI keep waking up late and days ruined \n\nPlease suggest me which skills i need to improve that'd be useful as a business student\nand share your weight loss journeys \nand lemme know if you have any suggestions for me please :((\n\n(Im not the best verbally apologies)",

            "comment": "When it comes to weight loss (or anything, really) consistency is key. Instead of focusing on quick fixes, try developing healthy habits that you can sustain in the long run. Incorporate regular exercise, make nutritious food choices, and stay hydrated.\r To help with accountability, you can consider using the Forfeit app. It's an app where you set tasks for yourself and commit to completing them. If you fail to provide evidence of completing the task, you lose money. This can provide an extra incentive to stay on track and follow through with your goals.\r  \n\r  \nIn addition to weight loss, as a business student, it's beneficial to work on improving skills like communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking. These skills can greatly contribute to your success in the business world.\r Remember, change takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and stay motivated.",

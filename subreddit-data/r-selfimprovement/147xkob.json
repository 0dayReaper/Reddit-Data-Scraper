    "postText": "I have fear for anxiety, i am stuck in a toxic loop with my self. I don\u2019t work out but i drink. I don\u2019t walk but i smoke but i understand my brain and body needs a change of frequency and direction. I am too afraid to move forward and take on challenges. How can i move on without triggering too much of my anxiety? How can i risk it when i know its possible but don\u2019t feel confident enough.\n\nI apologise for my bad english grammar.",

A few months ago I was drinking almost every night and not working out or eating healthy. I thought that lifestyle was \u201ceasy\u201d, but after reading that quote I realized it was actually hard since I consantly felt guilty, sleep deprived, depressed and anxious. Over the past two months or so Ive changed that completey, I workout 6 days a week and eat healthy. If both options are \u201chard\u201d but one results in me being healthier physically, mentally and emotionally, the choice is easy.",

Anyone who says differently is selling something\".\n\nTo me, choosing your hard is consciously making the decision to be proactive or reactive...or not acting at all. I try to be a mostly proactive person, but there are times when I'm non-active...and these times are when I feel stuck, depressed, or fatalistic. We have a 15 yr old dog who is deaf, mostly blind, has developed dementia in the past 18 months, and has had 2 strokes. I know he won't be with us forever, but when he had his first stroke I was devastated. To the point I wasn't sleeping, moving, eating, nothing. Then I \"chose my hard\" by realizing he was going to pass regardless of my actions or non-actions. I can wallow in sadness or I can spend what time he has by ensuring he feels loved, safe, and secure.",

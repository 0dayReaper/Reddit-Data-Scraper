    "postText": "(F16)\n\nI was always considered to be extremely intelligent. I was always ahead of children my age - when I was 6, in kindergarten, I would be reading medical books instead of interacting with children and all adults (except for my parents) always praised me for my intelligence. Even in secondary school my physics teacher started rambling about how intelligent I am in the middle of the class because I got shy when she told me that my project was fantastic (it was absolutely embarrassing I wanted to disappear from the room), even though I had mediocre grades from this subject on that level (all B\u2019s).\n\n(Now, shortly: in my country, you get into highschool based on your points. Points = points from your final exams from secondary school added to your final grades from secondary school and eventual addictional activities/achievements. Classes in our highschools are strictly profiled: for example classes with extended biology-chemistry-maths or maths-physics-english etc.)\n\nI got into the best class in my region. Actually, I was supposed to be in a different class, but you can always write a document to a headmaster, asking whether there is a room for a new student in a different class and they will most likely transfer you and that\u2019s what I did.\n\nNonetheless, even if I didn\u2019t get into this class, I would still be at the best school in my region. I\u2019m in class with extended biology, chemistry and maths, with additional extended French (DELF course).\n\nBeing in here made me realize how insanely stupid I am. Dumb, empty and hopeless. Surrounded by all of these actually talented kids, being probably one of the worst students in the class.\n\n(No I\u2019m not failing anything. My grades are just mediocre. And mediocre is bad in my class, because the other kids have stunning performance)\n\nBecause I was smart. Intelligent, whatever. But not in general - I just was that compared to my other peers. And now when I\u2019m faced with the best people from around my region, it opened my eyes.\n\nIt makes me feel so bad. Intelligence was the only good thing about me, ever. Because I\u2019m ugly and not very social, and I would rather observe than be a part of something. Which is considered unattractive (in many meanings of that word) by an extremely big group of people.\n\nAnd yeah, I befriended someone. We clicked so fast, because we\u2019re so similar.\n\nThe difference between us, that we\u2019re not similar in?\n\nShe is so fucking intelligent and beautiful at the same time.\n\n(And guess who isn\u2019t)\n\nShe gets good grades without studying, whereas I could study and still get a bad grade.\n\nAnd far enough, I\u2019ve had undiagnosed ADHD and just got diagnosed and all, but still. So many people with ADHD have extremely good performances and I\u2019m just\u2026 there.\n\nI\u2019m glad that I got faced with this, because I was and always will be scared that I\u2019m living in my own bubble. And I did, with my intelligence. But it just hurts so bad. I also want to be smart, and pretty, and cool and I also want to have good grades and good social life.",

I couldn't tell you hot to carry X over Y into Z, but I can tell you how to change change a tire, install a bidet, change oil, repair a garage door, grout and tile a floor, install a ceiling fan and install a wall mount for a flat screen TV. Not the most impressive but I can do shit that people pay other people to do.   \n\n\nShe gets good grades without studying but who gives a shit kid? It's not just about studying but change your methords. Do the 25-5 method, study 25 minutes take a five minute break with a timer on and off. \n\nBuddy, you're still at the beginning of the game and you've got time. Nothing but time. Keep winning kid.",

            "comment": "Struggling in school doesn't make you dumb or unintelligent. First, I would recommend eliminating the words, stupid, dumb, unintelligent or anything else like that from your self talk vocabulary. It doesn't help you and it only serves to make you feel bad. It will also make it harder to study and do well in your classes. Also, comparing yourself to others doesn't help. It might seem like everyone is doing better than you from the surface, but you don't know what their individual and invisible struggles are. Do you have access to a school counselor or therapist? Can your parents help you get connected with a therapist? It might be helpful for you to talk with someone (in particular, someone who specializes in working with teens with academic/performance related pressures).\n\nIt also sounds like you've hit a learning plateau. Everyone hits them and everyone has different plateaus in different subjects. There are brilliant engineers that couldn't sing a song in tune to save their life. There are brilliant singers and composers with perfect pitch who just can't handle high level math. It doesn't make either of them stupid. They're still geniuses in different ways. \n\nI was much like you when I was a teenager. I built my whole identity around being the \"best\" in the class and in every class. It wasn't until high school that I encountered fellow students that were better in certain subjects than I was and it was a very rude awakening. It didn't make me dumb though. I'm still intelligent, it's just that certain subjects don't click with me like they do other people. I also had to learn to let go of being \"the\" best and instead try to be \"my\" best if that makes sense. My plateau in math was Calculus. It did not come naturally like it did to others and I really had to work hard to get through it. Same with US history. I literally failed most of the exams in the class but still eked out a B because I got a 5 (maximum score) on the AP exam and knew how to write a good essay. I remember one kid that got 100% on every single exam in that class and would always finish tests in half the time as everyone else. He was a savant and was also very passionate about history and politics, but him being a savant didn't make me stupid. I just learned to ignore what he was doing, be happy for him that he had his niche, and worked on doing the best I could do.\n\nIn school it's really easy to adopt the mentality that if you're the best at everything and get perfect grades that it's the ticket to success later in life. Trust me, it's not. I had a 4.2 in high school, got 5's on most of my AP exams (which are like university level exams that you take in High School in the US to get early university credit), had a 4.0 in junior college but then struggled immensely when it came time to actually pick a major and think about my career. It ended up taking me 8 years to finally get my Bachelor's degree. I was an excellent student. I had a 3.97 at the end of it all. The problem was, I had over-identified as a student, and shedding that identity to become a working adult was too painful for me. I would keep switching majors as soon as I got close to finishing one. (Eventually I just picked business because everything is a business at it's core, right?)\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, this is just a short part of your life to get you ready for what will be the majority of your life. Years from now, no one will care if you were the best in your class. Do your best to be successful, but do it for you, not to show everyone that you're the \"best\". \n\nBeing this way also severely stunted my social skills. I was so fixated on being the best and being right and had such a rigid mentality that I really rubbed people the wrong way when I first started working. I was completely unaware that I was doing this because it was so ingraned in me. I was the \"teacher's pet\" so to speak but struggled with social interactions with peers. At work, I was a perfectionist, would point out others mistakes, and wasn't really all that fun to be around. Somewhere along the line, I had an epiphany and realized that I just wanted to be a nicer, more fun, relaxed and easy going person. I was conscious about this, made conscious changes to my behaviour, and now get along with coworkers just fine.\n\nYou will get through this  and you are not stupid. Again, I strongly recommend talking with a counselor or therapist. It really can and does help.",

Ive fallen off of gaming and am uninterested and burnt out on making stuff i know at my deepest truth is not my passion. Im thinking of rebranding the antonsagony channel to jared smit and jared smit to antonsagony. I want to pursue this fitness further than ever. But im thinking of the cons, how will the algorithm treat this rebrand, how will this affect my subscriber base and their intrests, will this rebrand help with more impressions overall on what i want to do? Im not sure. What would you suggest brothers and sisters?",

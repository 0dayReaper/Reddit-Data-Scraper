Maybe it's because i subconsciously think i don't deserve it somehow, which consciously sounds stupid, but maybe that's how it works subconsciously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis feels awful, and it doesn't help at all with my social anxiety. How do i fix this?",

If you won't care for yourself, for your self-esteem then who will? I mean, just take a minute to reflect how all the cells of your body work day and night, without respite just so that you get to live, get to experience everything this world has to offer. Just like the planet earth, we're here despite all the odds and for a very short time. And I think we should make the most of it :)",

            "comment": "I understand I get this too. It is because deep down you do not feel like you deserve it you are right. Where does this belief come from? Well, for me it is a deep seated sense of shame, completely unjustified of course, I've made terrible mistakes but its human to do so, we are all flawed. Some of us however, have a harder time accepting this, as we learnt along the way that we had to be \"perfect\". As you have social anxiety too, I will assume it is this for you also, as SA is also related to a deep sense of shame. This shame can originate in childhood (parents, bullying etc), or from things you have done that you regret (much more likely events to occur if you have issues from childhood btw, it's a vicious cycle). I developed this issue more intensely after a period of drug abuse, from which its very hard to forgive yourself for, especially the terrible things it makes you do. And I wouldn't of abused drugs to begin with if there was not already shame and issues from childhood anyway. Look into searching terms such as \"toxic shame\" and \"the shame cycle\" to further understand the basis of such issues. And remember, you do deserve it, we all deserve love.",

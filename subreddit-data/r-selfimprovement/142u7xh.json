    "postText": "I (28M) grew up being the smart kid, I barely had to study for school to get by until university, in which I had to keep a scholarship, and resulted in me getting an excellence diploma in my degree. I was a mentor for other students even when I was in elementary school, I'd get paid to teach math or physics to other kids, and that became part of my scholarship service during university.\n\nThis plus the fact that my mom and dad has always told me and my brother we were smart as hell resulted in me having to prove I'm right cus otherwise I don't feel smart.\n\nWhen I was younger, like 17 or so Facebook was in its prime and I had a lot of arguments with random people all over the internet, and I even made social experiments with them to prove my points, I would bait certain behaviors, or poll some groups to gather evidence for an argument and prove my point. I even argue here in Reddit, and I also argue with my friends, and I want to stop doing it, it's not healthy for me, nor it's healthy for my friends.\n\n  \nI know it's dumb, but I always try to argue, and yeah I most of the time believe I'm right, and when I genuinely feel I'm wrong I'll stop arguing and accept I was wrong, what I want is to stop arguing even if I believe/know I'm right.\n\nI'm aware of the issue, which I think it's the first step to solving it, I don't know if this comes from low self-esteem (I don't think I'm that insecure, but maybe I'm too proud to accept that I am?) or if this counts as childhood trauma in a sort of way.\n\nHas anyone dealt with this or has some tips? I'd deeply appreciate it.",

It may seem counter to what we are use to, what a narcissistic society would demand of us... whipping ourselves in a frenzy of negative energy to push ourselves further.. \n\nthe wellness of our state of being depends more on our ability to be more careful about which energy sources we pull for the motivations that spur us to motion.. we can take more responsibility around this being more mindful and present... to be stalwart defenders of our internal state means being willing to, and developing skills involved in slowing way down",

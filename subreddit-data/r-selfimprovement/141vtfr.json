I don't want to miss out on the advantages a small, hyper-competitive community can provide. But everywhere I look, I can only find massive communities that accept everyone regardless of ability or drive, where everyone in it could care less about each other. \n\nI am a writer, and I want to compete with other writers. I am an aspiring entrepreneur, and I want to compete other future entrepreneurs! How can I find the communities I'm looking for!?\n\n**Please help me!**",

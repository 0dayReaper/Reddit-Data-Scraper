I like to listen to something inspiring on my headphones while I do it, but I also try to take a few minutes to listen to the sounds around me and appreciate nature. It\u2019s such a small practice but it has been such a positive thing for me.",

Now it's something I look forward to every day and I haven't missed getting at least 30 minutes of exercise daily in 135 days. When I don't get my daily exercise, I feel rather dumpy and my whole life spirals rather quickly. I'm in a worse mood. I eat less healthy foods. I stay up later and want to sleep in later. I fall behind in chores. I'm less productive and more likely to just waste time on the couch.",

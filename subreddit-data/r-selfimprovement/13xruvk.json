    "postText": "So back in the day, I took courses to become a hypnotherapist. I never started a practice, but I've used the tools extensively. Here's the one that changed my life in a big way.\n\nBasically, memories are encoded not just with the sights and sounds of the event, but with emotions.\n\nEvery time you re-experience a memory, your brain re-encodes it with updated emotions.\n\nSo if the memory comes up and you have a big emotional reaction to it, it will come with a bigger reaction next time.\n\nThe opposite is also true. If the memory comes up and you give a metaphorical shrug of your shoulders, the memory will lose the emotional attachment - effectively losing it's power.\n\nNow here's the beautiful thing: what I'm going to describe can be done in the privacy of your mind. No one has to know you're even doing it. And it's very easy.\n\nHere's how it's done:\n\nCall up a memory that doesn't serve you.\n\nChoose your perspective. You can experience it first-person, if you wish, or you can be like a fly on the wall. If the memory is too intense, you can literally back up - all the way into space if you need to.\n\nChoose your approach. I have a pair of visualizations that I use to defuse memories.\n\n1. If it's a childhood memory, which it is 90% of the time, I'll often show up as my adult self and support my childhood self. This could be in the form of a hug, positive words, whatever.\n2. I then imagine a beam of light, shining down through the clouds, that heals me and my younger self, and bleaches everything else.\n\nJust like that, I have re-encoded this memory. I can recall it the next day and the emotional pull is not nearly as big. I do this daily until the memory has no power or fades completely.\n\nYou can basically do whatever you want in those visualizations, but the point is to create comfort.\n\nIf you're hearing a lot of sound in your memory, have your current self show up with a beat-box, that you can turn down the volume.\n\nIf you're more of a touchy-feely person, have your current self provide the affection you craved in that moment.\n\nAs a visual person, draining the color from my memories is powerful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's how I'm using this technique now:\n\nIRL, I have a hard time socializing with women that I find even remotely attractive. Even on a totally social level, I feel like I'm beneath them and my inner world discombobulates.\n\nSo I started pulling the memory thread and found several childhood memories where I accidentally hurt girls on the playground/in gym class, and felt tremendous shame.\n\nI've been following the technique I described above and sure enough, it's already starting to shift. I can hold eye contact longer, without a flood of emotions ruining the party.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe same techniques washed away the fears from a lifetime of bullying. I used to be intimidated by nearly all men, now I don't feel intimidated by anyone. It's quite thrilling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yea, there's a technique you can use to change your life, from the privacy of your own mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: a couple people pointed out that this technique might be dangerous, especially if the memory can elicit extreme emotions. If that sounds familiar, I would save this technique until you have a professional alongside you.\n\nIf you liked this technique, check out Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman. You'll learn A LOT.\n\nDepending on the emotion that comes up, you can actually create competing states that make the 'bad' emotions go away.\n\nExamples:\n\nAnger is diffused through happiness, and happiness is (ironically) elicited through hard work. I like working hard at house chores, for a win-win.\n\nAnxiety is diffused through laughter. If you're feeling anxious, turn on some stand-up comedy, until the feeling goes away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's also a handful of emotions that I think create a lot of our limiting beliefs - fear, disgust, guilt, and shame.\n\nThose beliefs trigger you on a subconscious level. The thinking mind can only react to the feeling that pops up.\n\nYou can put those limiting beliefs on ice through the technique I described, but also reflecting in a journal, actively challenging yourself by seeking out the stimuli (if you know it's coming, your conscious mind has a better chance of holding the reigns), and simply building an understanding of what this emotion is trying to accomplish.\n\nEach emotion has a physiological response that shows up in our body and gets picked up unconsciously by other people. That's why it's so powerful to learn this stuff.\n\n**Cheat Sheet:**\n\nAnger - prepares us to fight\n\nHappiness - prepares us to work\n\nLove - prepares us to relax\n\nDisgust - prepares us to avoid\n\nFear - prepares us to run\n\nGuilt - prepares us to reconcile\n\nSadness - prepares us to stay close to home\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The only thing we do that you haven't noted is naming and feeling the emotion associated with those memories. Maybe not needed for all of them, but I find it helpful to revisit old painful memories and look analyse the whole situation from a new, adult lens that I didn't have back then.",

This technique is a combination of timeline and a couple other techniques.\n\nThat's interesting about naming what you're feeling. In my current example, I wrote down shame... but what I really felt in those moments was guilt. \n\nThat guilt was amplified by anxiety, and finally shame set in when the teachers got angry at me. \n\nThen I got angry at myself.\n\nNow imagine reliving those memories dozens or even hundreds of times, encoding even stronger emotions. Now that shame is toxic, and I'm on high alert for it, spilling into my social behavior. It becomes an identity-level belief that I just don't cut it.\n\nDescribing it like that makes it really unemotional, which is kinda awesome. Even if it's not 100% accurate, it's a useful story.\n\nThe road from there to here wasn't magic; it was biology.\n\nAnd choosing a new road is also a biological process. All I have to do is direct my day dreaming at the right things. \n\nNifty stuff!",

Perhaps I'll add a disclaimer.\n\nThe concept of moving back from the memory if it's too intense is meant to protect against that a bit.\n\nWith particularly painful memories, I've visualized myself as far back as Saturn, lol. Just staring out into space, feeling a pin-prick of emotion.\n\nAnd as that feeling subsided, I'd move a bit closer. Eventually the moon, then from the clouds, and finally third person.",

I have been dealing with such bad anxiety it turns into depersonalization where nothing feels real and I get really intense intrusive thoughts over and over. I have also been dealing with intense vivid nightmares and all of this results in terrible sleep/ sleep schedule which affects everything else and I\u2019m desperately trying to get a grip on reality. I think trying this will really help me. It may sound stupid but for some reason I get really paranoid about changing the direction of my thoughts as if changing things means I\u2019m correct and things aren\u2019t real- that we are in some dystopian nightmare/ simulation. \nBut I know I have dealt with so much trauma and this is probably just my body being in full fight or flight mode and reading this really made me feel like I can be there with all of my memories and not change them but work through them over and over so my body doesn\u2019t feel like this anymore.

If you're not yet able to even notice a negative thought spiral, this exercise could go downhill quickly. But it's great for people who have already cultivated that skill.",

I'm more targeting the recurring memories that no longer serve me.\n\nTo me, a lot of these brain mechanisms would've served us a lot better in the pre-modern world. These days, those responses tend to be over-blown, and if we never challenge them, we can be haunted forever.\n\nI've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to influence and even communicate with the unconscious mind.\n\nMy hypothesis is that all visuals, sounds, feelings, and even words that bubble up out of nowhere is the unconscious mind talking to us, or at least, bringing things to our attention.\n\nBut what's also interesting is that there's a lot of processing power in the unconscious mind.\n\nIf you work hard at a problem, fail to solve it, and later, the solution pops into your head, that's because the unconscious was working at it while your conscious mind moved on.\n\nIf I'm trying to solve problems, I'll make notes and see what thoughts bubble up. Then I'll explore the best thoughts, resulting in even better thoughts bubbling up. \n\nOften times, this ends up looking like a dialogue between two people. Conscious mind asks a question, unconscious mind presents answers and curiosities, on and on.\n\nThere's also such thing as two much. I was doing this style of journaling where I was exploring masculinity and drudging up loads of toxic crap - writing for up to 2-3 hours a day - and a depression followed, lol.\n\nNow it's paying off, but I definitely learned not to go that hard.",

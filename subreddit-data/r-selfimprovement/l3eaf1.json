Anyone who sticks around here for long is probably after that inspiration fix and not actual problem-solving. There's no such thing as \"self-improvement\" in a general sense. You either get closer or farther from the goals and standards you've set for yourself.\n\nOnce you set those goals and standards, you should be looking for relevant resources. Can't get out of bed in the morning? Go to r/getoutofbed. Want to be an artist? Go to r/artinstruction. Want someone to hold you accountable? Go to r/getmotivatedbuddies.\n\nSelf-improvement requires facing specific problems and removing specific obstacles. We can't do that when we're all coming here to get away from them.",

If we look at the example in this post: \"starting before you feel ready\" can be disastrous in certain fields. Meanwhile, preparing carefully can give you a great edge on other fields.\n\nThrowing a feel-good motivational line up in the air isn't helping people in their path to self-improvement.\n\n(I had to re-post this comment without the wikipedia link because the rules disallow any links at all.

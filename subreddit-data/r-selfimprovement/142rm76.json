I feel like I have the knowledge on how, read the books, listen to the podcasts. Maybe I stick to the new habits/routines for a few days and then gone again.\n\nWhat worked for you to finally stay on track long enough for it to become a habit you didn\u2019t have to think about? \n\nThanks x",

Following this I have learnt to enjoy my time in the gym, it helps that I have seen my quality of social life improve because of the results. On the rare day I don't want to train I stick to Marcus Aurelius words from Meditations - In the same way that the birds, the ants, the plants do their job as it is in their nature. You must also do your job as a human. \n\nHe didn't say exactly that but you can search on the internet for the full passage.",

I have to send an evidence completing a task, or i will lose a certain amount of money. It helped me a lot to study everyday and go to the gym, since i would lose $10 if i didn\u00b4t do it, so i would say it was bulletproof to help me to create consistency.",

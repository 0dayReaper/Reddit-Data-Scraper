    "postText": "Behind procrastination, there is negative affect (thoughts, feelings, moods) about a particular task or the outcome of that task.\n\nSometimes it is related to a fear of failure, low self-esteem, lack of confidence, feelings of incompetence, etc. These hidden anxieties paint the task in negativity and we end up delaying the task. We participate in aversive tasks which make us feel better in the short term to cope with the negative mood induced by the task.\n\n**The proposed solution is emotional regulation.**\n\n* Choose the task you procrastinate.\n* Bring aversive and negative emotions &amp; thoughts associated with the task into awareness.\n* Instruct yourself to tolerate those negative emotions such as boredom, fear of failure, fear of judgment, feelings of incompetence, etc.\n* Address those emotions by regulating your emotions in a structured manner. Begin with allowing those emotions to exist. Do not suppress them. Then tell yourself that you are strong, tough, and resilient. Finally, ascribe more emotional meaning to the task and emotionally commit to that task.\n\nSource in the comment section.",

            "comment": "It does work. This technique is also associated with mindful meditation, which is really effective to cope with negative emotions. Whenever you feel anger, frustration, or worry, first, accept the fact that this emotion exist; do not fight it. Then observe it non-judgmentally. Become aware of where it is in your belly, and how it feels. Do this for a couple of minutes. Not only will this make the negative emotion go away, but it will also prevent the myriad of negative thoughts that usually follow, which also bring negative emotions. It's all about breaking the cycle, nipping it in the bud before it grows too big.",

I try to acknowledge that I have a fear of failure, but my mind goes to the worst and I start to think how much of a failure I am and all the things I have already done wrong and would much rather not stockpile all the bad emotions and frustrations associated with it. Feelings of frustration and sadness leads to desolation and loneliness and depression and then I go back to my quick fix, which later disappears into a sadder loneliness and depression. I\u2019m sorry I just hate my actions, but I\u2019m too narcissistic to hate myself.",

Three modules are particularly applicable: Distress Tolerance, Mindfulness, and Emotion Regulation. Several workbooks are available, and r/dbtselfhelp has links to some resources. Also, be aware that *affect* regulation is different from *emotion* regulation (see Wikipedia; the former is external and behavioral; the latter is internal)--sometimes you have to do something even though your emotions object.\n\nFor procrastination specifically, a strategy based on this hypothesis is to divide tasks into small, specific actions that can be completed in a short amount of time, reducing their emotional weight. If you don't know what to do, make a list of what you don't know about doing the task and look for answers. Make a checklist for all the steps so that checking off each step is a small reward. Define very small steps to get started (\"(1) sit down at my desk; (2) open my book; (3) set a 5-minute timer; (4) read for 5 minutes\").",

I have an undergrad in Psych (though my Masters is in Computer Science) and I'm a huge proponent of mindfulness techniques and CBT -- having a decent understanding of clinical psych practices. \n\n    you can't list 4 things and assume everyone will find it helpful\n\nNo one is saying or assuming that **everyone** will find it helpful. That's fairly impossible. CBT, which is often touted for being the one of the most empirically supported forms of therapy, still only has about 68% efficacy, because of course.. \"you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink\". Responsibility lies with the beholder. The mere existence and knowledge of a technique does not automatically fix issues for the reader. It takes work.\n\nHere's the thing....\n\nNo one ever said that changing something you struggle with would be \"easy\"...because of course it's not easy. If it was, then everyone would be healthy and self-actualized.\n\nIf you (or anyone else) is looking for an \"easy\" solution, then you will be greatly frustrated and disillusioned. However, techniques that can simplify the process or break it down into steps are greatly helpful for **those who are willing to put in the effort**. \n\nMake no mistake, there is nothing in this world that will change someone who is not willing to put forth the effort to change. In Psych therapy, they break patients into a couple of different categories.\n\nOne of these is the \"complaint-ant\" category. I forget the exact technical term, but this signifies someone who wants help and who is there of their own volition, but wants the therapist to fix them without effort on their part. This type will bemoan their current state but resists any sort of call to action. If you feel the way you do about this sort of post, then it's likely you would fall into this category.\n\nThe goal is to move this type of patient into the direction of recognizing and owning their own mental health. These types of patients accept that change will involve discipline and effort. They are willing to work collaboratively with the therapist to their own betterment.\n\nEdit -- Also...My understanding isn't just academic. I have a neuropsychological syndrome and number of other comorbid diagnoses myself. Techniques like this have really helped me fend off depression and control the course of my own life. I started out thinking/feeling as you do. So...I get it. It's not \"that easy\" because it **never is**, but it's worth it.",

As an alcoholic diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD but with no further access to counseling of any sort, there's things I can't rationalize myself into. Like right now I want to get my teacher certification but I need $400 to enroll in the program but in my current living situation it's daunting to figure out how I can get a job to make the money. Im living with my grandma a 15 minute drive from a small town without a personal car. It's easy to slip into hopelessness when the solution isn't obvious.\n\nI have a degree in chemistry but I feel like the biggest idiot just trying and failing to get my life together.

That means you may not know today *how* or *when* you will raise the money, but just having a specific goal in mind puts you in a good position to achieve it. Sometimes the right opportunity is around the corner, just out of sight, but in the meantime you can work on putting yourself in a position to make the most of that opportunity when it arises.\n\nFirst things first - you will need to take care of yourself. You CAN get better without a therapist! There are a number of good self-help therapy books that can enable you to significantly improve your health on your own. I really like *Feeling Good* by Dr. David Burns, and you can pick up a used copy on a website like \u201cthrift books\u201d for really cheap. The other component of therapy - talking to someone - is really important, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a professional. It can be anyone that you trust. Journaling will also help you make sense of your thoughts and work through them on your own. Journaling about anything at all will help, but in addition I do gratitude journaling for my depression.\n\nI\u2019ve learned that my PTSD is simply a reduced ability to relax and feel safe, secure, and comfortable - but you CAN practice those feelings. If you are removed from the chaotic environment and are now living in a peaceful home then you can do the following exercise at home! Otherwise you will need to find a place that you (rationally) know is safe and quiet and set aside time to go there. Relax your body and mind, let go of your obligations and worries (you can deal with them later), and tell yourself that you are safe. If you have a frightening thought, notice it, observe it, but do not ruminate/dwell on it or dive into the anxiety/paranoia. At the same time, do not try to suppress the feeling (it will only make it worse or delay it). Instead, allow yourself to simply feel it and be mindful of it. Then, allow it to pass naturally and redirect your thoughts back to comfort and safety.\n\nAs you use these techniques to practice self-confidence, you will notice it is easier to stay sober. Throughout the process, your mind will continually try to trick you into drinking, because you are an addict. You must not listen to it. Do anything in your power to avoid drinking.\n\nBut, if you do relapse, forgive yourself. Do not allow yourself to believe that all hope is lost so you \u201cmight as well\u201d keep drinking - that is simply another trick. When you sober up, you will feel worse physically and mentally for some time, but as you work on your health you will return to feeling great in no time. Don\u2019t dwell on your losses, keep them in perspective by reminding yourself of your recent wins.\n\nThe right opportunity is just around the corner. Get ready for it.\n\nBy the way, maybe look into tutoring people online?",

It's a huge relief. And I have done books I've bought but never got around to reading, I think I'll definitely do that soon.\n\nAnd I've thought about tutoring - is bad timing with it being summer but at the worst I can tutor and substitute in a few months. I'm always looking for something to get my by in the shit term so maybe it's best I slow down and focus on the long term and actually establishing something. I've really always wanted to teach science. I think it'll make the happiest and let me build a good life to start over. And Texas is big so it could lend to me getting that change of scenery I desperately need.\n\nThis comment was good, thanks again. I need it today",

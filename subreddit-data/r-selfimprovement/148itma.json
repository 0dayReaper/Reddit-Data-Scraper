    "postText": "I started total lifestyle change and did crossfit + another training 4-6x a week with a good diet. My mood was very great and response to training transfered the overall look of my body much better. Also didn't watch any pornography at all. I have done this many times before and almost always end up meeting + dating a girl. For my unluck at some point the fresh romance dies off and i start party (drink alot) much what leads to no training, two days hungovers and binge eating + watching porn and that ends back to square one. \n\nNow the same shit happened but i have been on the binge under 2-weeks and really reflected this shit and decided to get back to the good things that led to my great mood and succes in a firstplace. \n\nAnyone else has been experiencing this? I mean when i write this shit up it sounds straight self destructing behavior, why the fuck i should drink and worry over some woman which will lead to even more frustation and unhappiness? I know a damn well if i get back on the grind that under a week my mood has been increased 100%. ",

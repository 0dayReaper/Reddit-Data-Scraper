    "postText": "I have a problem of having this idea that a relationship/marriage will be the solution in my life. And I get too attached to whoever I talk to/date. I just got out of a relationship where I was expecting too much out of someone who didn\u2019t even care. I always have this idea that whoever i\u2019m dating is in the same boat as me (for example our end goal is to marry and live happily together). But it seems I always attract people who don\u2019t want that. So I want to focus on myself and keep the idea that a relationship/marriage is a \u201cgoal\u201d in my life aside. I want to be content with myself and not wait and worry for the \u201cright person\u201d to come.",

I'm thinking maybe there is one person that thing might work out with but idk yet. I guess the solution would be to find someone you actually enjoy being around and doing stuff together. I think that by trying to be alone you aren't accepting something but rather forcing it to be the case.\n\nTry new things, make an effort with relationships when they start to get going but I don't think too hard about the end goal. If you're meant to be together you will just do that.",

            "comment": "The technique I have found to work wonders with a variety of things is to imagine the \"worst outcome\" I.e. you never fall in love and get married. Suppose you find out that this is actually how things will go and nothing you do will change that. What then? \n\nWhen we are young we aren't burdened by time, we have so much ahead of us so we don't worry about what will or won't be. As we get older, we become acutely aware of how quickly time can pass and how often things don't got our way. We become anxious and desperate. I find the best solution is to simply accept the reality of our situation. We may never fall in love or marry, we may never have that successful career etc. You shouldn't make your happiness RIGHT NOW conditional on what might happen in the future. It's simply beyond your control.\n\nSo, imagine that you already know things won't go as planned. What will you do now? Just go out and live your life as you are right now :) enjoy what you do have right now and accept you simply cannot control what will or won't happen. ... Usually, once you start living more positively for yourself in the present, genuine happiness follows \ud83d\udc96",

Instead, meditate on the idea of being alone. How would you cope? What else would bring you happiness?

If you keep attracting people who aren't suitable for you, then it's likely that you're inauthentic, probably not intentionally but because you lack the life experience required to know who you are, what you like, and what type of person you're most compatible with. \n\nYou should shift your primary focus from relationships to self-discovery. In addition to improving the basics (looks, money, etc), try as many new things that pique your interest, regularly introspect and document all of this through journaling. Good relationships and marriages happen organically when you understand your identity and present yourself genuinely.",

            "comment": "I think this inquiry is so important and avoided by many. So, first -- congrats on asking yourself a very hard question. I also struggle with this, having left behind a string of exes and failed relationships.\n\nNot to get too academic, but I do believe this stems back to childhood and how we saw \"love\" and relationships modeled to us. There's also society's lies, the \"you complete me\" stories and \"love at first sight\". \n\nI think the best thing you can do for yourself (and I'm here in this stage too) is focus on yourself. What makes you happy? What do you want your days to consist of? What kinds of activities do you like to do? Take yourself out, get out of your comfort zone, go on some solo trips.\n\nSociety's lies would have you believe that this isn't romantic, or fun, but truly, dating yourself is the most powerful and sexy thing you could ever do.\n\nLike I said, I'm doing the same right now, I don't think it's a quick fix. There will be lonely nights and mornings, but ultimately, it's about cultivating a loving relationship with yourself, where all the love that you have to give, you give to yourself instead of someone who doesn't deserve / appreciate or isn't ready for what you have to offer.\n\nThat's all I got -- hope that helps. Here's to putting yourself first. &lt;3",

Accidentally or on purpose, whatever.\n\nThat seems like the direction you may be headed.\n\nYou may likely want a partner for qualities you\u2019d like but don\u2019t like to work for.",

Then finding a friend that I ended up absolutely taking in love for and realizing that I'm happy just being friends with them,  because you don't need to be in a relationship with someone to truly love them, and have intimacy with them, for some that's really hard to differentiate. \n\n\nI just recommend building friendships over relationships, because we can tend to rely extremely on one person in a relationship, and with friends you can rely on multiple. As well as friends help with the lonely feeling. Making friends is also easier, there's not as much weight on the line, you can just hangout cause you wanna hangout and enjoy their company, a lot less stress there. \n\n\nJust give yourself time, and keep doing that introspection, and find out how you can make you happy, not how others can. Best of luck my dude.",

But you may not have many opportunities to, I don't know your situation, it's your life. But yeah make yourself happy, find a hobby you love and maybe that hobby will lead to new friends,  and I see it more as extrapolating what you want from a relationship from multiple friends, vs a distraction. Because most of us desire companionship and thats not a bad thing, the feeling you have a natural, is just understanding them the hard part.

Is your mindset that of:\n\n \u2018if i\u2019m fine with being alone, i\u2019ll be good as next time i meet a girl im interested in i\u2019ll be okay whether it works out or not. And the fact that i\u2019m so independent now, it\u2019s more likely to work out\u2026 hopefully\u2019?\n\nI\u2019ve tried this and for me it hasn\u2019t worked. The fact is being with someone you like/love is always going to be better than being alone, you cannot dispute that. As soon as you feel that feeling again, the lies you\u2019ve been telling yourself will unravel and you\u2019ll good back to your old ways - this has been the case for me.\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution?\n\n1) Focus on reality, not fantasy. Often times I convince myself things are going okay when they are not, or that they will magically work themselves out. Like, i\u2019m hoping the person will do the things or be the person I need. When in reality, my needs aren\u2019t being met and I\u2019m not actually having a good time being with them. \n\n2) Don\u2019t invest your well-being into the perception of another person. This is the tough one for me. Maybe you do the same. When I like someone, I kind of become a passenger. How my evening is will be dependant on their mood or how much affection they give me. How good my week is will be dependant on how we have been getting along. Since I like them, I become dependent on them to maintain the interest they have in me. It\u2019s a MASSIVE TURN OFF for girls.\n\nThe mindset which is better which i am trying to adopt is:\n\nI\u2019m going places, I like you, youre welcome to become part of my life given that you provide me with what I need. I will also do the same with you but I will always put my own interests first.",

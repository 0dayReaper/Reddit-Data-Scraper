    "postText": "I have a pretty non demanding job. However, every time I have a busy weekend I feel like I am taking an entire week to recover. I have difficulty getting back into my work routine, doing chores, and even engaging with my partner. I feel like my battery is empty and I cannot recharge it no matter how much sleep, yoga or meditation I do. \n\nI hate the way this makes me feel about myself and how much the fear of being drained contributes to me avoiding doing social things. \n\nAny tips?",

I heard that you can add salt to coffee to cut it's bitterness.\n\nThere are also wake up pills on amazon that you take right before bed, that are delayed release and kick in with a burst of caffine in the morning.\n\nOnce I did that for about 7 days straight and it synced my wake up time naturally. \n\nAlso, I started incorporating down time *first thing in the morning*. \n\nI take 1-2 hours to myself to do whatever I want before work. \n\nI look at a meditation opportunity to leverage your imagination to fulfill your wishes.\nSo for battery, try out just generating for yourself endless joy in something like the 2nd jhana. That you can soak in as long as you wish.",

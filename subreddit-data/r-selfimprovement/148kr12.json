    "postText": "i\u2019m starting my journey of self improvement for the millionth time. it has never stuck before. my biggest issue is that i hate the way i am. my executive disfunction is a mess (i have awful adhd), self care is a battle every day. i started by making a massive list of everything in my life i want to change. it is a lot, from brushing and flossing every day to budgeting better to working towards a career to having more friends, the list is long and expansive. i was doing some journalling about what it might look like if i didn\u2019t have an almost abusive inner narrative berating me every time i mess up or have a hard day, and it sounds really nice. like my life could be a lot better if i had self-acceptance and didn\u2019t hate the way i am. in theory, i feel like the first step to change is acceptance, but i feel like i have so much evidence going against why i shouldn\u2019t accept myself and why i should hate the way i am, because i feel like i just really suck at being a person. but maybe the reason this endeavor has never worked out is because i am full of self hatred and cannot accept myself as i am. what if i change everything on my list and still hate myself? so i think the first step is to accept where i am, how i am, and be okay with it but still keep doing what i\u2019m doing in small steps to change. but how does one get to that point of self acceptance? if anyone has gone through a similar thing, i would greatly appreciate your advice.",

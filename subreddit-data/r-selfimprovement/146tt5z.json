    "postText": "hi! i've been in a slump for almost a month now, after a very heavy semester of classes. I plan to start getting back up through a reset day that i'll be having tomorrow. for context, I live in a small town so there's really not much to do in our place. so far, all i have right now in my list is staying in a cafe to eat brunch and do some stuff on my laptop. i need more suggestions though (preferably stuff that can help make me love life agen). \n\nalso pls send ur tips and also,,, love :')). i've been going through a rough time recently. a lot of difficult conversations have to be made which will make me need a lot of emotional support. i really want to do this already but i just cant seem to find the strength.",

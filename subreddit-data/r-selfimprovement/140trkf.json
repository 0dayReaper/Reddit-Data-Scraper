    "postText": "Hello Friends, I am a 24 year old male and have found myself in a rut. I am in college though to be fair I have no idea what I wish to do with my career. To be frank I tend to struggle with indecisiveness, low self esteem, and low discipline in terms of time management or delaying dopamine. \nWith that said, I have no idea who I am anymore, I no longer feel like I am the man I was when I was 18, which is not bad, there are things I have improved upon. There are things however that still remain cloudy and uncomfortable to me. I find myself struggling with image and the people I used to love I often wonder if we are still as close as we were. It feels different, empty. In terms of a career I know im not as inclined to mathematics or logic, that said, I would struggle physically with trades or the patience for healthcare of people. As you can see I am at a bit of a loss on where I am in this crazy road of life. I hope that it is a bump and that I can recover and get a sense of \u201cpurpose\u201d or at least become more stable financially, mentally and physically. Any advice my friends would beneficial, have a great day.",

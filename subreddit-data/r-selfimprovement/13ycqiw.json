    "postText": "I\u2019ve experienced so much pain over the years from people criticizing or judging my lifestyle choices. I\u2019ve always felt the need to over explain why I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing\u2026 I use to fight people on my lifestyle choices but it\u2019s never gonna end. You can win some people over but then new people will enter your life to take over the battle of criticism. \n\nNowadays when people criticize my choices I just take what they say with a grain of salt and thank them to end the conversation, and not fight them,\nand still do what I want, anyway.",

And the ability to be muscular is one of the great gifts God gave man, and I used to be so swole the Jamaicans I knew from high school called me the Vanilla Gorilla, so if anyone who didn't approve of that was just envious.   And I know if I had told my old man that I was going to go search out fame and fortune in L.A. he probably would have disowned me, because he has an Ivy League law degree and worked at the same downtown Chicago firm his entire career, and he realized pretty early on that I was not going to follow in his footsteps so he basically wrote me off at that point so I might have gone to LA just to spite him.  And to your point about unhappy people , I think it was Thoreau who said \"Most men live lives of quiet desperation.\" so they're more likely to envy you and try to sabotage your confidence to bring you down to their level, and those guys become pretty easy to spot so I just ignore them altogether because they'r nothing but toxic.   But you're head's obviously on straight so thanks for responding, and best wishes for success in all your future endeavors.",

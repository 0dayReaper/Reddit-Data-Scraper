I spend way too much time on Instagram and Reddit.\n\nI\u2019ve tried using iPhone app limits, but they\u2019re easy to bypass so haven\u2019t found it very effective.\n\nI\u2019ve tried completely deleting them, but realized I don\u2019t want that because I follow pages with events happening in my city so it\u2019s been helpful to get out of the house and find things to do. \n\nIt\u2019s really the endless scrolling and the absent-minded picking up the phone and opening the app that are major time sinks.\n\nThanks for any advice",

So what i\u00b4ve done in the past was setting it to send a screenshot of my screentime with Instagram and Tiktok below 2 hours combined, or i would lose $20. It was bulletproof  and i hope it can help you!",

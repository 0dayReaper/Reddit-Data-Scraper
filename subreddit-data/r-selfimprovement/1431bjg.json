    "postText": "\nHello, I\u2019ve been kind of hesitant of writing this post, and honestly I don\u2019t even know if anyone will read this (it\u2019s going to be kind of long), I\u2019ve searched for similar posts but honestly no one seems to be in this sort of situation. I don\u2019t know if this is the right community to post it in so mods are welcome to take it down.\n\nHonestly I don\u2019t know where to start, I\u2019m 17 and have absolutely NO friends, I talk to no one at school and during lunch I just leave the school and walk around the vomit inducing repetitive suburbs for the whole hour just so I wouldn\u2019t need to bare the embarrassment of walking in loops around the school alone when everyone\u2019s sitting in a group and actually engaging socially. Needless to say my grades are shit (failing 2 classes, dropped one) and so is my attendance (60% at best) yesterday I had a physics quiz, I skipped, no biggie, right? \n\nWhat\u2019s funny is that it wasn\u2019t always like this. A year ago I moved from a whole different nation which basically changed everything for me. I used to have a huge friend group and basically knew everyone at my old school, I used to have good grades and actually enjoy my life. Nowadays all I do is f*p, watch YouTube and eat with a shitty sleep schedule. I tried to change more times than I can count, I tried talking to my guidance counselor atleast 4 times, I tried talking to classmates, tried getting a job(impossible), gym, diet, dopamine detox, nofap, water fasts, you name it. I tried it all, and what comes out the other end? Just the same old \u201cme\u201d, just a ghost, were it to disappear no one would even notice. I\u2019m actually so sick of trying to change, all to result in the same me, I hate this. Im literally just a spectator, constantly consuming, never contributing, constantly looking at others online, praising/criticizing people I actually don\u2019t give a single fuck about. Bad case of ADHD? Maybe. Lazy fuck? Definetly.\n\nThe last year has been absolute hell for me and I don\u2019t think I can do this much longer. I have no motivation, no self esteem, I literally BAIL ON PLANS without cancelling just because I\u2019m too scared to admit I\u2019m embarrassed and broke (I guess that also makes me an asshole). \n\nHell, my family fucking hates me too, it gets bad to an unnecessarily \u201cphysical\u201d point with both parents and siblings, I also caught unwillingly picking up their mannerisms which made me extremely ashamed and disgusted with myself (I smacked my dog on one occasion). With no job, no friends, no (real) family and no education. The only place I see myself in a year is either the street or the coffin. I\u2019d buy a car if the job market wasn\u2019t so shitty and impossible to get into.\n\nThe only thing keeping me somewhat down to earth is my friends from back home who I still talk to sometimes. I have a vague vision of where I want to be in the future, but I just, do not put the work into it. I tried to just \u201cput my head down and grind\u201d, and it doesn\u2019t work, maybe I didn\u2019t try hard enough. The reason I made this post is with some sort of hope that someone will suggest something that I never tried, someone will suggest something that will actually make me want to live again, someone that once was where I am right now and can look back and say \u201cI\u2019m glad I pushed through\u201d. Take this as a last call out for help lol. My life is a continuous stream of boredom, shame, and most of all, disappointment. Thanks for listening to my vent.",

            "comment": "Sup bro, first of all, I'm glad I could see your post and I want to tell you that I know what you're going through. Im 17 as well and during the pandemic I didn't have the best of times, literally had no energy to even get out of bed (some days I would need more than 20 minutes just to stare at the ceiling wondering what was the meaning of even living), I'd wish to die every single day, for more than 6 months and I hated myself that I didn't have the courage to actually end my life (I actually got to pick up the knife and point it to my neck but after that I just couldn't go on, thankfully), it got so bad that I actually went to a psychologist and she said that my brain had blocked most of my emotions so that I literally didn't go insane, so I think I have a bit of experience to talk about this topic lol.\n\nI'm not going to get into the topic of religion cuz even if it helped me a lot, I don't think that is what you want to hear (but if you want to just reply to this message and I'll tell you the things I learned that I find it would be real good if you knew).\n\nSecond of all, you need to know that change doesn't come when you make a decision, that is just the first step, it takes months, sometimes even years, so that you can be fully healed. That said, don't get frightened or try to give up, as the path is actually enjoyable.\n\nI will recommend you go back at doing an exercise, I'm going to the gym for 8 months now, for example. It DOES help you a TON, so you just gotta be patient and trust the process, you maybe won't see any difference while doing whatever, but if you stop you'll see that the time you used to exercise you will waste at porn or videogames and that you will be a lot less productive, and talking about porn, I'd recommend you stop that too, I know it's hard, I haven't stopped with this addiction as well but I'm trying, just so you know, we as humans have the urge to sleep, eat, have fun and have sex, the first two you can't stop doing, but when you waste the \"have fun\" with videogames and the \"have sex\" with fapping, your body thinks that you already have everything and so you won't crave for nothing, making you feel like you don't have energy to do nothing. Not saying that you should 100% stop with videogames or anything that could make you have fun, but keep that at just 1 and a half hours or 2 hours, use the rest of your day to do stuff you hate, like going at the gym or playing basketball (and that would count as exercise AND having fun if you like it, plus team sports would help you with social interactions too), studying and helping your parents with the dishes or vacuuming the house, personally I use that time to write my book, watch self improvement and mental health videos (Like Hamza, Stoicism, psychologist interviews/podcasts and since I'm religious, watching some preachings as well), take my dog out and in the close future will use it to study for my university admission test (I'm not from the US).\n\nThird of all (lol I don't know if I this exists) you gotta STOP saying things like \"I'm a failure, I suck, I don't do anything productive, etc.\" If you lie to yourself for a long period of time, your brain will start thinking those lies are the truth, and so you will live thinking that you are a horrible person when you just don't have the right mentality (and don't use that to say to yourself \"I suck, my mentality is ass\"). Also practice mindfulness, that's pretty simple, you just do whatever you are going to do but instead of thinking about other things while you are eating, for example, you just eat and think on the present moment, in this case, about the food and the ambient you're in, instead of thinking about the test you have and if you're going to skip it or not, just think if the food is cold or hot, tasty or bad, if you're in a nice place or not, those kinds of stuff.\n\nFourth of all, START JOURNALING, there are two types of journaling that I'm aware but you should search more info about it in the internet before starting: the gratitude and inspiration journaling and the \"put it all out\" journaling. The first one is very self explanatory, you get a piece of paper, maybe a notebook, and everyday by the same time (it's okay if some days you have to journal earlier or later but try to do it consistently at the same time) you write at least 3 things you are grateful about that day, even if they are silly like \"I'm grateful for using the toilet\", and write some inspirational quotes so that when you feel unmotivated you can read those and go right back to the grind. The second one is quite the opposite, you write everything that you feel uneasy and the things you're going through today, write your problems, things you don't like about yourself, put it all out, the objective of this type of journaling is that in a few weeks or months into the future you can go back and read the things you wrote in the past and see how you have changed, we don't notice it because we live with ourselves everyday, but when you look back and see everything you made, you'll notice that you change a lot in a few days.\n\nFifth of all (I promise it will be the last one), make a routine. Grab your phone or a piece of paper too and write down a routine you know you could follow where you can also be productive, you don't need to be THE machine of productivity, just separate a time for exercise, playing games, studying and journaling (not necessarily in this order) and follow it, you don't need to follow it 100% all the days as well because there are some days where stuff happens, like a birthday party or you need to go to the doctor, but on normal days, follow the routine as best as you can, maybe even don't think too much about it, just go and do it.\n\nThis comment is long as f*ck but I hope you read it all and remember to not pressure yourself too much, without the \"you\" of today, there won't be a \"you\" of tomorrow.",

I hated life at 17 also.\n\nBut teens and young adults tend to see more roadblocks and stop vs how to get around those roadblocks. You said you tried several things and nothing works, but it doesn't sound like you stick with things very long. It takes a solid few months to begin leveling out and feeling/seeing the benefits of habitual exercise. You can't do something for 2 weeks and expect it to magically fix everything.\n\nYou won't start to feel better until you learn to start forcing yourself to show up for your responsibilities and goals. Skipping class feels like you dodged a bullet in that moment, but you feel like shit for not handling your responsibilities in the long run. You wouldn't be posting on here if the culmination of your bad habits wasn't weighing on you.\n\nExercise, at least 30 minutes, at least 5 days per week. Everyday is better. make your diet healthy as possible. Garbage food makes you feel horrible. Google anything you don't know how to do, instead of not doing something because it takes too much effort and is hard because you aren't sure how to do it. Google simple healthy recipes, how to grocery shop healthy on a budget, etc. Go to class and do your work even when you don't want to. Apply for any jobs available. There's no fast food or any jobs at all? Any income is better than no income. Take what you can get and keep applying for better jobs. Pick a goal and work towards it. Life gets better and better overtime if you aim upwards and work towards goals that you specifically want for yourself. Things don't get better over night, it's a gradual shift from moving in the direction you want your life to go. Read self improvement books. \n\nI hated myself and life as a kid. I fumbled my way through my 20s drank too much. Didn't really start getting into fitness and self improvement until my mid 30s. 40 now and happier and in better shape than I've ever been in my life. Wish I knew then what I know now. Life is WORK with some fun and relaxation in between. But things won't get better until you strengthen your discipline and learn to face responsibility head on. Don't stop at roadblocks, look for detours and get there a different way than you thought, but keep going.",

At least I did. Personally, I knew what I needed to do to improve when I was 15. I just couldn't actually start doing it until I was 20.\n\nSchool forced me to get up at 7, so I was chronically tired for my whole adolescent life. As soon as I left school I got a job with a night shift, so now I can actually function during the day.\n\nI didn't have any friends until I was 22. I didn't make friends because I didn't want to be friends with kids. Kids are stupid and immature. I couldn't relate to kids or teenagers at all. I was also stupid and immature, but I was barely smart enough to know it. It was only until I could start meeting adults that I finally found people I could actually relate to.\n\nA lot of basic life maintenance, like going to the gym, buying clothes or doing meal prep, are only practical if you have a car. You can't get into a rhythm of good habits if you're at the mercy of other people's schedules for transportation. I mean theoretically you can do pushups and stuff at home, but I've always had trouble with that. I need the routine of actually *going* to the gym to keep me motivated.\n\nI'm not saying this stuff as a free pass to resolve yourself of responsibility. I still recommend working on the stuff you can control. But I used to feel a similar way, and I used to think I was broken because I couldn't function. My parents sent me to different therapy's since I was 11. Turns out, the way average teenage life is structured was just completely opposed to how I function that it made my life a living hell. As soon as I left school and finally had some freedom, I was able to structure my life in a way that made it a lot more tolerable.\n\nSchool sucks ass. I would rather kill myself than go back to school. Teenagers are dumb and being around them is insufferable. Anyone who willingly wakes up before 10am is a goddamn psycho. Vegetables taste objectively terrible. These all sound like red flags when you hear them from a kid, but its also all just fucking true. Now I'm a goddamn adult. I can choose my own hours, learn things by reading books, blend vegetables into a tolerable smoothie. Or if I really want I can do none of that, wake up at 1pm, drive down to the grocery store and buy an ice cream cake, then eat the whole cake in my car. And sometimes I *DO.* And its awesome.\n\nStay positive and give it some time. It could be that your best self just doesn't fit into the societal normative lifestyle, and once your break free from the structure you will be able to make changes a lot easier.",

    "postText": "There are so many things that I am struggling with, a lot seriously and I feels stuck. I have an untreated mental health issue which is neglected by my parents and a gaming addiction . I am still not financially independent and dependent on parents for so. I also suck at socializing ( also a bit of introvert myself) and can't continue a conversation. Like when I start a conversation, I cannot keep the spark of it and the opposite person gets bored easily .I am also bad at sharing my vulnerability  and it always feels like there is an invisible wall between me and my parents. I feel so unlovable at times and think that Maybe I am not fit for getting love at all. While i feel like something is wrong with me, but I can't figure it out. Any help?",

Take some paper. Be honest. Then organize what you\u2019d also like instead.\n\nSuggestion to work up a comprehensive strategy.",

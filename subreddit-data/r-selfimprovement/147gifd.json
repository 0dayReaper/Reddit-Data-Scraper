I\u2019ve just stopped giving attention to people that I don\u2019t feel a desire to connect to and being more truthful about how I feel in action, which has led to less (fake) connection. \n\nI\u2019ve started to feel like I\u2019m bad but I realize that I\u2019m not hurting people, I\u2019m just being more straightforward and honest and a bit blunt and less bubbly.  \n\nI think I\u2019ve got some pent up resentment for being a people pleaser that\u2019s coming out too as frustration or pettiness too which is contributing to the evil feeling. \n\nAnyone else?",

She invited me to her upcoming birthday, but this time I said no, without going further. I\u2019m tired of putting up with people who give me negative energy. Perhaps I\u2019m getting old.",

After a lifetime of worrying about everyone else's feelings over my own, I felt that way too, but soon it'll just feel like a massive burden has been lifted on you, and you'll be able to see that other people are responsible for their own happiness.",

    "postText": "Social media convinced these kids that they all need to be a jacked, millionaire, playboy, entrepreneur, with a smoking hot wife by the ripe old age of 25. This is why you see 15 year old kids blasting an entire pharmacy clinic worth of steroids up there asses, harassing people at Walmart for internet points and scamming people on the internet. Let me tell you something, you will NEVER be able to compete with the elite level douchebags you see online. Unless you are blessed with talent from God himself and get extremely lucky you cannot compete with nepotism babies and ruthless psychopaths of the world. Work hard towards your goals but stop comparing yourself to these douchebags.\n\n**Edit:** just kidding\u2026 *get money, fuck bitches*",

Yes, work hard for your goals but none of these have to be your goals and having/being any one of those 4 things by 25 is very uncommon. OP's right that SM makes us think that we're supposed to be extremely successful at a young age. Follow your own timeline and follow your own heart. Finally, marry someone that makes you laugh and not just someone that turns you on.",

When i was younger i used to think The Rock just *worked harder.* Then i grew up and realized these celebs are BLASTING hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of steroids up their asses to achieve these results. i just wanted to point out that if you\u2019re trying to emulate someone else\u2019s success you have to account for everything. Its not always just *hard work*. There\u2019s a lot of nepotism, sheer luck, and lies that we aren\u2019t seeing that goes on behind the scenes. The grindset is cool until you burn yourself out into a deep state of depression realizing you will never achieve the same results through hard work alone and that\u2019s ok. Doesn\u2019t mean *don\u2019t try* but just be real with your expectations.\n\n**Edit:** My post wasn\u2019t intended to deter anyone from being a jacked, millionaire with a hot wife, by all means, go for it. *In fact,* i think most guys should strive to dominate and excel while their young. My intentions were just to shed light on the reality of what it might take, what you\u2019re up against and hopefully bring some peoples expectations back down to reality. Theirs a lot of delusional people out there and especially young kids are pretty gullible.",

Something that needs to be understood is this type of attention seeking is pathological and not healthy or normal.\n\nSuccess is only an illusion if you are not in touch with your soul. Sit down and have a conversation with any older person with a stretched out cat face they have from facelifts because they can\u2019t accept the reality of getting older. Or an older person who is miserable with their super young partners they have nothing in common with. They have mutually disappointing relationships that are dependent on money. You will see they are miserable, terrified, insecure people. Because they never learned how to be happy with themselves in their soul. They have always depended on outer appearances to define them and everyone will reach a point where that shows. It\u2019s very sad.\n\nAt the very least, people who flaunt their \u201csuccess\u201d are all quite dishonest. They advertise themselves and their possessions in a way that is meant to cause envy at its core. This is really negative, low-vibrational behavior that will catch up with them eventually if it hasn\u2019t already.",

They are broke, work shitty jobs, save for a 2 week lavish vacation. They all band together so they can pool their money in and get the \"pent house.\" Looks like a great time but they come back and have nothing. \n\nThey take a gazillion photos and stunt like that's there 365/24/7. Same for some of the girls in the circle they have sugar daddies that pay the trip. Idk if they are bonning them or not but they act like that's theirs. In 10 years when they're \"old\" it'll end. \n\nIdk for me there is pride in obtaining it yourself and actually owning your lifestyle, pride on being honest and having people know the real me. You'll almost always notice these people are extremely insecure, and not fun to hang with. If there's no jetski it's misery, they can't enjoy life for what life is. \n\nFocus on yourself is all I can say align your goals. If you want the ferrari that's ok, but youll quickly learn what it really takes to get one and see there's a lot of BS. Just look at SBF and the Fyre Fest guy, prior to the scandal they seemed like top dogs.",

Also, different things make different ppl happy. I'm a ppl pleaser bc i love making life better for others. But will also be happy sitting home alone. \n\nI'm genuinely happy most of the time, then I get my depression mode, or my anxiety mode. My mom and dad, in my opinion,  are never happy. My dad is either working or drunk and mom is one of those ppl who is only happy pleasing others...but even then \"it's never enough\" for her. She bought me a purse for Christmas.  I love it. I already used it. But just found out bc I didnt do a big old hoopla when she gave it to me: she spent yesterday thinking she failed and wishes she bought something else. \n\nMy dad refuses to show \"sad\" or \"mad\" emotions and is always chasing the next thing that will make him happy.  My biggest example is my education.  Each time I got an A it was met with \"no A+?\" Or when I finished one chapter of school it was \"congratulations on your big accomplishment,  when are you starting the next level of education?\"",

Improvement comes from internal rather than external validation for the most part. If you\u2019re constantly surrounding yourself with people who judge and prod you rather than supporting you, it\u2019s time to go low-contact with those people. I wish you luck in education and your own personal goals! I also struggle with the same people pleasing you mentioned (probably because of my childhood in a narcissistic household) and sometimes stretch myself too thin. The difference is, the people I please now are thankful for what I do for them and give back instead of merely criticizing.",

I worked retail before the army and came from a middle class family. The problem is most of you rush it in your 20s when you have to buy on loan or credit and stay in a cycle.

Andrew Huberman, Chris Williamson, philosophies of life channel on YouTube, Bedros Keuillian - I am smart enough to understand that people like Tate are unique, and I will never be like them, and I don't even want to - I do know that I want a lot of money (so I can live easier and afford the best possible healthcare for my family), I do know that I want a great looking girl who will appreciate me for me, and I wouldn't mind a nice car if I can ever afford one down the road - but I do it MY way, and there are so many problems in life right now, that listening to your fucking idols everyday does NOTHING but waste time.\n\nIf you don't take action and close your fucking YouTube, nothing will ever happen for you. I don't understand why the youth and a lot of guys are so impressionable nowadays and so easily manipulated. What happened to people thinking for themselves ??? Tate is an entertainer!! And so are the other guys like him. STOP taking that shit literally.\n\nEnhance your health and fitness - learn some skills - and pave your own way. I'm 33 years old - and I hate my life so much that I'm finally desperate to put in work every single day to better myself. I love podcasts and books. But most of all I learned that action trumps everything. Not a single word or episode will save your life unless you TRY.\n\nLike Bruce Lee said - take what's good out of the practice, and discard the bad. Live your own life. Be your own self.",

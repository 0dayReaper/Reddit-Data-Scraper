Idk I like how it can make my anger sadness stress, and pain go away very quickly and I like that plus I don\u2019t drink so it\u2019s something to get fucked up a bit. But also it make me lazy, less social and dumber. Any advice is appreciated even if it\u2019s something I don\u2019t wanna hear",

So it is kinda tricky but that\u2019s probably just my fiend brain talking me into smoking to make this dumb headache go away",

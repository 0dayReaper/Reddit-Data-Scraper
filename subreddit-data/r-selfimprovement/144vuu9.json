    "postText": "So I\u2019ve been putting a lot of thought to it, and I think it\u2019s time I gave up a hobby of mine. You guys don\u2019t know but i animate with LEGO and used to upload videos to YouTube. I last posted a video around 2 months ago, and haven\u2019t posted anything yet. But I\u2019ve been considering dropping it, and just selling a lot of my stuff for money so I could focus on bigger things. I\u2019m only 16 but I\u2019m already starting to feel like I need to mature and prepare myself for adulthood. There\u2019s obviously still a lot of other hobbies I have, but animation doesn\u2019t really capture my attention anymore and I feel like it\u2019s childish. It\u2019s not really how I want to be remembered for, if I even am remembered. I guess I just want to leave a bigger impact, if I leave one at all, that\u2019s more mature. Idk, maybe I\u2019m overthinking this, but what do you guys think?",

What would you like to explore next.  \n\n\nAnd, this may not fit for you, but maybe it's not the animation you turn away from, but the stories you're telling using the medium...?   \n\n\nFinally, I woudn't worry about whether or not it's childish. I know many middle-aged adults who still collect and build LEGO ;)",

I did have a talk yesterday with a good friend who always seems to know what to say, and I\u2019m feeling a lot better thanks to them. I still want to mature, but maybe I won\u2019t leave animation",

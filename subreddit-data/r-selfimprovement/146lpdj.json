How do you **work on your self-improvement** in real life? *Feel free to mention apps, categories, tools, concepts here.*\n2. What's the hardest thing you find about this journey?\n3. Why is it important to you?\n4. Do you like seeking help in private (coach, mentor) or in communities? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis would help me realign and anchor my own life accordingly.\n\nThanks in advance buddies.",

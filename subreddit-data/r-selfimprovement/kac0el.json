The thing is that there really isn't that much quality control unless the therapist does something extreme like sleep with their client. .  And it's very difficult for anybody to tell if they are decent until it's too late. I've found that few of therapists can tell if they are actually helping their clients either. \n\nIt's more like gambling, except should you lose, you not only lose money but also get emotionally traumatized",

            "comment": "I don't doubt that a good relationship with a good therapist can be quite helpful, and would encourage anyone to seek it out if they think they coiod benefit from it (and can afford it).\n\nBut the vast majority of people in the world do not have access to/cannot afford a therapist, and it is ultimately not necessary. **All a therapist can truly help you to do is to become your own therapist** through self-awareness and mental and emotional control, and this is available to anyone, anywhere for free through honest, humble and compassionate reflection, meditation, various spiritual practices, or even just a decent friend, mentor, community or spiritual leader, etc... \n\nThe key, as I said, is in developing humility, honesty and compassion with yourself and the refusal to do so is why, I suspect, most therapy or other relationships fail - people are not yet ready to properly open up and confront their issues and shortcomings. I'd imagine, however, that a good therapist (or, again, friend, partner, priest, rabbi etc...) is able to help someone become more ready than they would otherwise be. \n\nI have improved myself considerably for 6 years without the help of anyone. Though that's not at all true - I've sought the insightful, wise, compassionate guidance of the wise people and traditions through history who have long since figured out this mess we call life. Philosophy is where it is at - literally the love of wisdom. Stoicism, Christianity, Buddhism, Nietzsche, Jung Yoga, Confucius, Taoism, etc... all have a tremendous amount of wonderful guidance for us all. Start dabbling. \n\nI recommend, above all, Joseph Campbell, who did a magnificent job distilling and equating the essence of all of the world's traditions into enjoyable, inspiring lessons and stories. Star Wars and many other movies and stories that we all love would literally not exist without his work. I can't recommend him highly enough, especially to those who (frankly, appropriately) roll their eyes at my suggestion for these various spiritual practices. The problem is not in the traditions, but in their followers who don't understand them and he helps to present and decode them in a way that is accessible and amenable to all. \n\nAs Nietzsche said, \"There has only ever been one Christian and he died on the cross\". All of the traditions are rich mythologies meant to be read metaphorically - if done so, they all have limitless power to guide our lives, because we're fundamentally all the same. Read the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius - a Roman emperor from 2000 years ago - and try to tell me it doesn't seem like some guy wrote it yesterday.\n\nI hope this is helpful to anyone, especially those who feel lost and don't know who or where to turn to. Know Thyself is the great dictum of Ancient Greece and it will always hold true - use them and whoever else piques your interest to help guide your path. It's all in your power.",

It'll be different for each of us, given different preferences, skills, opportunities, situations, etc... For many it is simply the survival of their children, as that's all they can handle. But as your material situation improves, we need to find things beyond our immediate family to focus on that contribute to the common good, be it other people's material suffering, the environment, or whatever. \n\nIf you can find something to focus on and become competent at, I'm confident that your self worth, confidence and speaking ability will improve naturally. You'll meet people who are aligned with your path and social interactions will improve as well. I suspect it'll help a lot with trauma as well, though that requires more reflection in order to understand and accept what has happened, but also to figure out how to avoid such things in the future - the anxiety etc comes from not yet having figured out the lesson. \n\nAnyway, here's a handful of books tjat I've found useful that you might like as well.\n\n* On the Shortness of Life - Seneca (my first foray into philosophy and I've reread it a dozen times. Short, powerful, timeless. Guaranteed to wake you up) \n* The Hero with A Thousand Faces - Joseph Campbell (and anything else you can find from him - talks, interviews etc... Will give you a wonderful guide to how to go through your own \"Hero's Journey\" by decoding/translating/opening the door to all of the world's great stories and traditions)\n* The Farther Reaches of Human Nature - Abraham Maslow (if you're familiar with him, you likely grossly misunderstand his ideas. This is his final book that goes well beyond what he is typically associated with and will show you how we sell ourselves short by being self centered on self actualization. Self transcendence is where it is at) \n* The Choice - Edith Eger (haven't actually read it yet, but I gather that it is very similar to Frankl and has been very helpful to people)  \n* Capabilities Approach - Martha Nussbaum (I don't particularly like her writing style, but she gives a good framework for how to look at the needs of the world) \n* Small is Beautiful - EF Schumacher (a beautiful vision for what sort of world we could have someday and some practical ideas on what to do about it) \n\nThere's plenty more of course. The most useful tool, however, is writing. Start journaling, and eventually cross examining your thoughts. You'll quickly realize how little you know on anything, but also be able to figure out where and why you've gone wrong (even if it is just how you've responded to things others have done).\n\nI hope this is helpful.",

My circle of friends and family prolly suffered for two to three years, and gradually it got better after three continuous years of counseling.\n\nSo, a lil bit of cray-cray and therapy/counselling do help ease the emotional burden in stressful periods of life. Afterall, seeking professional help/paying to get yourself heard by an impartial third party should never be considered as weak!\n\nKudos to everyone who've been there and keep striving!",

All of these things are distractions from the thoughts that plague your mind, and all of these things can suffer from tolerance build up until they no longer keep your painful thoughts away. \n\nI understand overcoming the struggle everyday of dealing with mental health. I promise I do. But there is ultimately no effective alternative to getting professional help. You would see a doctor for a critical injury, you can't just ignore that same advice for a dehabitating mindset. They mind is just as important and the body and requires treatment for ongoing injuries, that may have never even been treated once in your entire life.\n\nPlease take care of your mental health with real treatment.

Haha in case you\u2019re looking for inspiration in your lives, here are the dudes who give me internet therapy:\n1. Sadhguru - sweet lil old Indian yogi man, who is constantly cracking jokes &amp; when I watch him I literally can\u2019t stop smiling. Also, probably in the top 5% of wisest people on the planet. (Honestly, all 3 of these guys are)\n2. Phil Good - suuuuuper spiritually advanced leader in the young starseed spiritual community (if you don\u2019t know, prepare to have your mind blown)\n3. Vishen Lakhiani - author of a book that was #1 in the world for 5 days straight (Code of the Extraordinary Mind), and owner/founder of my opinion of the greatest personal development company in the world, MindValley \ud83d\ude0d been taking courses that are a part of that company for 10 years now! Can\u2019t stress how much all of those courses changed my life, MANY times over.\n\nAll 3 of these guys are easy to find on IG &amp; YouTube, as well as MindValley. I highly recommend going to check them out if you\u2019re going through some issues!",

There goes expensive 4 year degree, going homeless twice, running away from family, getting arrested for graffiti community service to now with a 40 hour work week, 401k benefits, apartment and car and I\u2019m still unhappy and just last week started therapy because art as my life as therapy got me this far and haven\u2019t made art is about a year. On the plus side I don\u2019t use social media besides Reddit now lol.",

Like it's already bad enough having to live it everyday but having taller people reminds you everyday how short you are is fucking hell bc there's not really nothing you can do about it. I'm 5\u20196, literally all my friends and cousins are 5\u201910 and taller which is such bullshit. They all have to make my height the subject of every joke and it be annoying as fuck. Even my grandma on my mom side is taller them me which is so depressing. And then don't even get me started on dating part that's a whole another post. But in conclusion, me having to deal with this for the rest of my life make me not even want to have kids bc I don't even want my potentially son to go this shit bc I fucking hate it.",

And just say \u201cf you\u201d to people who make fun of you for it. \n\nThere are women out there who don\u2019t care about height. There are also women who are shorter than you and would think your height is just fine. Plus, if you\u2019re in to it, there are even women who are taller than your height who wouldn\u2019t care about it as well. \n\nI\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d and I\u2019ve dated guys who were your height and even shorter. So trust me, don\u2019t lose hope. \n\nAlso! Don\u2019t have that mindset about having kids. Height doesn\u2019t work like that lol. It\u2019s kind of on a spectrum so to speak. It doesn\u2019t work like hair color, for example, where one gene will dominate another. So, two short people can give birth to a really tall child in comparison to their own height. And vice versa two tall people can give birth to a child way under their maximum heights.\nDon\u2019t let this thing of height impact you so much to make you thing less of having children. \nPeople will always pick something to bully others about.\n\nBest of luck.",

I assure you, its not the be all end all.\n\nSomeone here said dont let your height define you, and I agree 100% with that. Aint the size of the dog, its the size of the fight in the dog, and the ability to be measured about it.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not feeling awful about myself (which is an issue that is VERY MUCH NOT RELATED TO HEIGHT AT ALL) I have a big personality, I see women notice me, and if I\u2019m really feelin myself, I can straight up command the attention of a room in a charming way. Yeah, the 5\u20196\u201d dude just got everyone excited with their full attention just being a lil charmer, imagine that.\n\nNow if only I had the ability to do that on command lmaooooo\n\nMy point is: you\u2019re so much more than your height. Stick to your guns. Better to be short and know who you are, where youre going and what you want, than to be a tall jackass with a loud mouth. Or a woman who\u2019s counting inches silently in her mind who would scream at a man doing the same.\n(Dont you ever dare let that lead you into some woman hating bullshit though, that line of thinking will ruin your world and you in the process)\n\nYou may be short, but you can still be bigger than them in spirit and experience.",

I\u2019m a genuine girl, and I\u2019ve dated men shorter than me before (5\u20199) but honestly attraction is non-negotiable and there\u2019s something attractive about a man who is bigger and stronger than me who I know can protect me. I think it\u2019s part of human nature. But, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m in the top 1% of women based on height so there aren\u2019t many of me out there. \n\nOne of my husband\u2019s closest friends is 5\u20196 and his wife is beautiful, kind, smart, very talented in many areas and honestly just good at everything she does, and truly a phenomenal woman. Hang in there, OP. All is not lost! I agree that working on your physical appearance, being someone that people enjoy being around, and having a good job will all help you in the long run.",

Lean and muscular is attractive to the eye, but a lot of women like men who are on the fluffier side. I don\u2019t think physical size is the only indication of a protective man. My husband has a major RBF so people don\u2019t mess with him (probably moreso because of that than the fact that he also looks like he could beat most people in a physical fight anyways). Some men don\u2019t appear at first glance  to be aggressive or like they\u2019d be good protectors, but upon getting to know them we find this out. Take for example, my older brother. He\u2019s 6\u20196 and probably like 200lbs. He\u2019s a string bean. He\u2019s got soft eyes and a friendly smile but if you f*** with him or his family, all hell will break loose and he will not back down. So I don\u2019t necessarily think that men have to look mean or have aggressive body language to get a woman\u2019s attention. Just make her feel safe when you\u2019re around her and she will trust you to protect her. I hope that answered your questions!",

Tell you more about them than it does you.\n\nTo put someone down, especially something that they cannot control, shows a lack of humanity.\n\nYou could try a thing called a stepper.\n\n It will add an inch or two to people like Tom Cruise, and many of  the shorter people use it. \n\nYou gain another inch and a half or so.\n\nIt's 100% natural looking.\n\nThen again, if you do that, I'm sure these jackasses will still mock you and say take off the heels, even though they're not.\n\nI don't know the exact name, but there are some lifters.\n\nThere are only certain things you can change height is not one of them. \n\nIf you have good looks and a good personality, you go to the gym, but you don't have to overdo it because you don't want to get too big. \n\nAfter all, then it makes you look even shorter.\n\nYou're focusing on the one thing you can't fix. You didn't say anything about your great attributes; you're punishing yourself for something you can't change.\n\nOf course, women have this ideal man; no woman usually gets their perfect man.\n\nThere are some women indeed where height matters. These women love to wear heels; you may not even want to be around that type of woman.\n\nWhat if you just like casual you don't like someone who gets stressed unless it's a special event.\n\nBut these women do have preferences; if you're online and you see a profile it says no one is shorter than this, respect that and realize they're cutting themselves short of a person they don't know.\n\nI have a lot of Hispanic friends. Some are 5'5, 5 ft 6. They pull girls like it's nothing. Then again, it's the type of girl you're aiming for.\n\nBut you must accept that some people have preferences; that's not a knock on you; that's just what people want.\n\nThis thing is called deal breakers; what if a woman who smoked and you hate smoking doesn't make you a bad person, doesn't make her a wrong person to you? That might be a deal breaker, but it is no big deal. Many more people out there.\n\nIt just seems like you're letting your height Define you and your diminishing every good quality you have, and putting size as the most critical factor.\n\nI know your cousins and friends will say, \"You know I'm just kidding with you\" but believe me, those are douches; sorry to say, if it's always brought up, my advice would be to get new friends.\n\nOnce you let him know it hurts you, you might think hey. No, whenever they are pissed at you, they will put that dagger in you, knowing that it is a trigger for you.\n\nThere are many good women out there who don't care about height; they want a guy who treats them with respect, has a decent career, takes care of himself, and is good in bed, LOL.\n\nOh yeah must be a listener and have a sense of humor.\n\nPeople have given great advice here. \n\nThere's nothing else to say; work on the things you can change. \n\nThe other ones forget about it.\n\n Worrying and obsessing, thinking you're less of a person in the dating pool because of height, get that stuff out of your head!\n\nGood luck brother!",

They have caused this negative toxic thinking oattern for you and familys responsibility should always be to lift one another - you are all same blood. Tell them off, and either make them respect you or you dont respect them. Ofc be grateful that you have a family and you at least can be grateful that you notice WHO YOU DO NOT WANT TO END UP LIKE. Tell them youre fucking digusted of their behaviour of being losers. Remember that winners do not feel inadequacy or need to insult others that **might seem as an inferior trait**. They are mist likely insecure themselves and those kind of people feel the need to make someone else feel bad to uplift their own ego.\n\nSecondly, tell yourself the story in another perspective. For a long time I aswell thought it was a bad factor,but I can tell you from experience that height does not truly matter at all, when you dont give it power that it is a determining factor. Sure it's \"evolutionally\" a good trait to have, but remember in your case if youre clinging on to it youre only making it worse. Start developing the things you can control, stop clinging or stressing or reacting to things you cannot control and fully accept your height. Once I started not even thinking about that my height would matter, it did not. I was able to get girls every now and then if i trul wanted. Determine a belief that height DOES NOT MATTER and it DOES NOT affect your success to find girls or whatever.\n\nOnce you let go of the negative mentality and energy and start to be grateful for it, your whole game will change because you start giving off vibes to other people that you dont even recognize it would effect.\n\nIll give you one more scenario from 5 months ago. I found a girl who was into me and we started seeing eah other, I was about 170cm and the girl was perhaps 175cm. She asked \"does it bother you that Im taller than you?\" I instantly just said \"No, why would it?\" And that was it. Because I did not believe it matters shit, it doesnt, and she never asked that question again.\n\nYou got this bro. Come chat with me more if you feel the need for it, I'm here for u.",

I have similar problems because I am a 6ft tall cisgender woman, and I have had lots of problems throughout my life with developing feelings with men who are shorter than me, however never on my end. I have always been perfectly okay dating people who are shorter than me, but they (Men and Women) seemed to make a big deal about it. Even when I was dating my 5'11\" ex-boyfriend he was extremely insecure that I was just a *little* bit taller than him. I can't say that I understand the struggle of being short, but I hope you know that most women (especially if it is a small height difference) don't care if they are the same height as their boyfriend or a little bit taller than them. Besides, I wouldn't call 5'6\" short, especially because the female international height average is about 5'4\"",

I\u2019m engaged to the woman of my dreams who happens to stand at 5\u20198\u201d. It honestly isn\u2019t that bad being short as men and women make it out to be. Some women (usually shorter women) care, some really attractive women do not give a shit at all. Women usually find me much less threatening and we become friends quickly, which usually then makes for better hookups or relationships. \n\nRemember that if a women rejects you for something like height, just don\u2019t take it personally! Laugh it off, make friends with her and ask her to be a wingman for girls that do like \u201cshort kings.\u201d (By the way, where was the short king movement when I was dating!! \ud83d\ude02) I\u2019ve been in situations where a girl rejects me because of my height, I take it in stride and ask her to help me hookup with a friend, and then I hook up with her later. Not saying this to brag but rather show you that it\u2019s entirely on you how you want to process this!\n\nThere are so many gorgeous women, SO MANY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, that don\u2019t care at all if their partner is short. \n\nIn a lot of ways, being a short man is such a blessing. I also do Brazilian jiu jitsu and weightlift every day and I almost guarantee if I was 6\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t take these steps to do be the best me that I could be. \n\nLearn how to be charismatic, funny, confident, and self deprecating, and really good at sex.

I have a male friend that is shorter than that and damn that man was dating a different girl every 6 months or so. Very popular dude, very charismatic and never gave two damns about his height. Cheer up and learn to laugh with the jokes, or make good comebacks. The important thing is to detach from the negative emotions you get from this and look at all the good things you bring to the table as a person.   \n\n\nLife isn't as much about looks as social media makes it seems, looks, height, weight, money. Once you grow old and really pay attention to the real world you realize that real people don't care about any of this. (Real people as in, those who aren't walking around trying to live up to social media expectations.)   \n\n\nCheers.",

I shun people who make jokes about his height and we no longer speak. This includes family. You should tell them it\u2019s hurtful and if they don\u2019t knock it off you don\u2019t need to be around them. My closest friends and family would never do this to my husband.\n\nMy husband is also bald and slightly overweight and he is still very attractive to me and I love him dearly. His amazing confidence and sharp sense of style won me over more than his physique. Physicality is crap and we have no control over our bodies, when it comes right down to it.\n\nAlso you should get to a point where you are comfortable enough with yourself not to care. Denying yourself the miracle of raising kids because of your height is ludicrous. Kids will all get bullied and made fun of for one thing or another. You can\u2019t control that. \n\nAfter losing all of my hair to a medical condition, and hating my body for years because I have small breasts, I had to reconcile with the fact that I am not my physical body and anyone who tried to convince me that I was less than because of my body is an asshole. I am much happier now and much more secure in myself and my husband still loves me despite it all.\n\nNone of us truly has control over our bodies. Do what you can to feel confident and healthy. Confidence and health is everything. The rest is all smoke and mirrors. Cut out people who tease you because they are toxic and their priorities are shit. \n\nHang on to your ride or dies and live to the fullest. The rest is just noise and distraction.",

I would say there are a few options to consider. You could move to a place where people are naturally much shorter, such as Asia. \n\nYou can fully focus on building strength and being ripped AF. \n\nAnd most definitely: earn lots of money. It\u2019s sad but a girl who knows how you could potentially spoil her with richness could overlook your height. It\u2019s important to lose yourself in work in order to become a desirable person. Assuming you are straight. I have no clue if the gay community is picky in height as much as women do.\n\nGood luck bro. Don\u2019t lose courage or hope. \n\nAnd very important: attraction really is not on the surface, having a good sense of humor and being positive and charming is much more attractive than any surface level good looks. \n\nWoman who look for a long-term partner look for qualities within.

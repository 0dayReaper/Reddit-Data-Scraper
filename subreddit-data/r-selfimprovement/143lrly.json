Or it could just be that they were painting their fantasies of who they thought you were onto you, and they didn't match up with reality (surprise surprise). Or perhaps they were never planning on staying around and have done that to numerous others. \n\nUnless it's obviously your fault, I wouldn't worry about it. You should definitely try to always better yourself, but people leave, and that's okay.",

People call it \u201clove bombing\u201d. \n\nWhen someone likes you, it has nothing to do with you, just how they see you, that\u2019s the only reason we can even \u201ctalk people out of liking us\u201d, because they don\u2019t like us, they like the way we look or their idea of who we are. \n\nWith all this in mind maybe you find it really validating when people act this way and that makes you invest in a relationship or the prospect of seeing them more. As you can tell now, that not a smart way to see if someone likes you. \n\nIt makes sense to reflect \u201chow am I contributing\u201d but it might just be that your picking with a false understanding of how people work. If someone \u201calways thinks about you\u201d then you might ask \u201cwhat exactly are you thinking about\u201d, if it\u2019s only about how they feel about you, not qualities you actually possess or actions you\u2019ve done for them you are likely talking to a very impulsive person who (when their feelings change) will treat you differently. \n\nTLDR- you\u2019re probably picking people who obsess over you not realizing that their obsession has nothing to do with you, just what they think about you. You can spot the difference if you ask what exactly they\u2019re obsessing over.",

    "postText": "I always admire people who go out of their way to help others, and I've always wanted that for myself, but I can't get myself to care about others enough to do so. For example, when I donate money to the homeless, I don't feel good about it unless someone saw me in the act. It sucks to admit you're selfish, and it's not something I'm proud of but I don't know how to change. It feels like I'm instinctually wired to care about myself first.",

What about people that do go things and even get punished for it? If you want to be selfless then actually learn what about that quality appeals to you\n\nGiving money to homeless people isn\u2019t inherently a good or bad thing to do. In your case, the person your helping saw you, why is that not enough? \n\nI don\u2019t think what you\u2019ve said makes you selfish per say but you do value other peoples opinion of you. \n\nThe way you talked about it you haven\u2019t connected that being selfless is caring about yourself first because your putting intangible traits that no one can take away from you above something fundamental replaceable (money in this example). \n\nFor me personally I don\u2019t like giving money because I have the view that it can contribute towards their own bad habits, even giving food can seem like enabling their life style. It could be these concerns that are also at play.",

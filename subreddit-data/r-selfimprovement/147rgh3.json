    "postText": "Ever since 3rd grade I\u2019ve been friends with this one kid who I considered to be one of my \u201cclosest\u201d and \u201cbest friends\u201d. We still talk and hang out to this day, but I\u2019ve realized that he isn\u2019t that great of a friend. For example, I am always there to listen to his problems and help him out if he needs any assistance, and be there for him during hard times. On the other hand, he lacks serious empathy towards others and is never there for me when I need him. What\u2019s keeping me from just cutting ties from him is the fact that when we hang out, he\u2019s usually pretty nice. But when we hang out around others, he makes fun of me, invalidates what I have to say, and goes overboard with jokes about me. I feel like he doesn\u2019t respect me at all an I think it causes me to be angry and sometimes dictates how I feel. \n\nDo I just cut him off? Put my foot down and tell him I\u2019m sick of it? Im not sure what to do.",

    "postText": "I (17F) have recently lost a lot of people; family as well as friends. I am considering deleting social media but I'm just not sure it would help. I'm still in the same college and I'm still living with my family. I would still be existing near said people, I just wouldn't be seeing their posts if I deleted social media. I also have a close online friend who is the 1 out of 2 people I trust anymore. I don't know, I'm needing a second opinion.",

I had to send a screenshot of my screen time with Instagram and Tiktok below 2 hours combined everyday, or i would lose $10. It helped me a lot and now i still use these apps, but just a few minutes a day.",

If you spend the majority of your time on it scrolling your life away whilst judging yourself as you look at other people\u2019s lives, then yeah it\u2019s going to be beneficial to get rid of it and start living your own life. But kept to a minimum and not interfering with your life? Won\u2019t make much difference getting rid of it.",

    "postText": "When you are in depression or have anxiety, when everything feels impossible, bad and you lose your hope..what is something that keeps you going in life? What gives you motivation, courage. I am thinking about your thoughts and sentences.  It can be Bible verses, someone else's saying, a truth, a particular thought, whatever.\n\n\"Everything is temporary\" is something that personally helps me a lot in moments of great anxiety. \n\n\"Rest, don't quit\".",

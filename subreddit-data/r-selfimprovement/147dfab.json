    "postText": "I'm a 38 year old guy and I've been battling with procrastination for more than 15 years. Despite that, I have managed to achieve relative success in life. I'm doing well financially, have good health and have a beautiful wife.\n\nHowever, I don't feel fulfilled. My day to day life is extremely lazy. I'm self employed (digital marketer and programmer) so I don't have any boss or official working hours. I spend hours on my phone and on the computer, doing basically nothing, surfing the internet and just procrastinating with stupid stuff. I don't do exercise, I rarely visit my parents, and I don't pay enough attention to my wife.\n\nOn top of that, I've been struggling with porn addiction for 20+ years. My sex life is pretty dull, as I'm constantly draining myself with porn.I very rarely challenge myself in life and I'm always seeking comfort.\n\nAs you might imagine, this type of life does not lead to happiness. It's just a way of seeing life pass by in front of me. I would not be proud with myself if I were to die tomorrow.For this reason, I have decided to document my journey publicly. I know pretty well how I want my life to look like. \n\nLet me share it with you:\n\n\\- I would love to have mental clarity and spiritual growth. I want to be able to enjoy life as it is, staying present in most situations (conversations, walking around, doing house chores, etc). I need to put the phone down and develop mental focus and mindfulness.\n\n\\- I would love to have an amazing sex life with my life. We currently only have sex about twice a month. My porn addiction is the main reason behind this. Whenever I masturbate I just simply don't have any desire to have sex with my wife. The solution is quite simple: Quit porn and masturbation. Save my sexual energy for my wife only.\n\n\\- I would love to be super organized when it comes to my day to day life. Set up a schedule and respect it. Wake up early, do some yoga, take a cold shower, start working, get things done, have extreme focus. Then when it comes to leisure, completely disconnect from work and just have fun reading books, playing poker, going out with my wife, maybe even play some PS4.\n\n\\- I would love to be very strong physically. This I can accomplish with kettlebell training. I also love swimming, which I can do whenever I want as I have a swimming pool in my condo. Yoga, kettlebells and swimming. I can mix them up however I want. This will allow me to reach a later age with good health.\n\n\\- I would love to be able to cook for both myself and my wife. The food we eat is extremely important to our health.\n\n\\- Finally, I just want to have a life with values, incorporate good philosophies and grow up spiritually.This change is going to be uncomfortable. I'm going to need to learn how to embrace discomfort.\n\nTomorrow is going to be my first day. I will start with a very simple routine:\n\n\\- Wake up at 6am\n\n\\- Do some sun salutations\n\n\\- Work until noon\n\nThat's it, I'll keep it simple for now.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm going to delete Twitter and Instagram from my phone, as they are the biggest time wasters so far.",

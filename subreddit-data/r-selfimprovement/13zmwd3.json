    "postText": "When it comes to social skills, it seems every time I go out to socialize, a lot of other men, no matter if young or old, have this kind of unexplainable \"aura\" when talking to others, especially the opposite sex of course, and I can't quite figure out what it is about them. They aren't always the most attractive or muscular etc. Some of them don't even seem to have the \"rizz\" to be honest (fuck I hate that word. ) But they try anyway. to them the socializing, small talk and flirting seems to just come naturally, effortlessly and is fun. they always seem to have something interesting to say, do, or talk about..\n\nAm I just smoking shit is it all in my head or is it real but simply just about exposure and experience?\n\nIt's not just \"confidence\" either. I think there's more to it then that. \nAlso just being smooth and having \"the game\" is something different too, what I want to name doesn't just apply to flirting but social situations in general.",

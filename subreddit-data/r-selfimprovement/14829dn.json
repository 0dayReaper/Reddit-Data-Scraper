I wasted most of my teenage years (I'm 16) playing stupid video games with people who more or less subliminally made fun of me. And I don't know what to do because I'm going to a new school with two of these friends who aren't as bad, but still weird. And I don't know how to make new friends because I'm fucking fat and ugly and have no social skills and don't know how to talk or even express my feelings.",

Marching season will start in Aug. \n\nBand kids are very welcoming. They're not necessarily athletic. They're not necessarily cool.  But they are genuine and caring and creative and hard working.\n\nTake that trumpet or baritone or mellophone and practice your ass off so you don't let the band down.  \n\nYou're welcome. I'm serious. Do it.",

If you still say this at 25 then fair enough do something but atm all you can do is try be the best you while you go through the system",

Read self help books, try to stop bad habits, pick up new hobbies, exercise, work on social skills. You have a choice. Don\u2019t worry about big changes just do something a little bit everyday. Look at the direction of the progress instead of the total change. Keep working on it and I guarantee you will see changes in a year, two years. If you want real change it\u2019s going to take time. You are still soo young I wish I could\u2019ve started working on myself at 16 instead of 30.",

You are fat\n2. You do not know how to communicate and express your thoughts very well\n\nJust pick one, and ask yourself \"what is the root of the problem?\". Be pragmatical and very very honest. \"My diet is full of carb rich foods with low nutritional value\" for instance. Well, start opting for more fiber rich food, or low carb high protein food like chicken breast or oily fish. \n\nEvery day try to improve a little. And keep track of everything. Journaling is a huge help, make it a habit. Everything from what you felt that day in any situation to how you contributed to accomplishing your goals (or failed to), write it all down. \n\nAlso, be pragmatic with your goals. What can ypu realistically achieve? If you want to get ripped in 3 months, unless you start taking roids, or stick to an u heslthy diet for your age, it ain't gonna happen (I was there). Similarly, if you aim too low, you might feel you did not do as much as you could have in the future, so find a middle point and work hard to achieve it. SMART goals are a very easy to follow template to writing down goals.\n\nAnd lastly, cut yourself some slack. You are really young. Enjoy life, don't take it too seriously. And please do not overthink stuff. If you wanna approach a girl, just do it. If you want to workout, just hit the gym. The sooner you realize that peopled do not feed you and that they all have their own problems and issues to deal with, that they couldn't give more of a flying fuck about you, the better.\n\nYou can do it king. Just man up, it will take effort. It will take time, but as Miyamoto Musashi once said: \"It might be difficult, but everything is difficult at first.\"",

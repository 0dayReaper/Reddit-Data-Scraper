I was in a toxic, on again off again relationship for 3 years and I unintentionally dumped a bunch of relationships because of it. This relationship truly brought out the worst in me and I regret a lot of my actions from insecurities. It\u2019s been a year since I got out of this relationship and although things generally have been trending upwards and I\u2019ve worked on myself a lottt, i still can\u2019t help but feel completely unwanted/disliked. I moved to a city where a bunch of my college friends live, thinking I\u2019d have a better support system here, and all it\u2019s done is made me feel disliked by people I thought were lifelong friends. They all have group chats without me in them, I\u2019m constantly hearing about events they all went to together and I didn\u2019t get an invite, or I\u2019ll get invited to an event and then I get ghosted but see on social media that they still went. I\u2019m scared to reach out to people because I can\u2019t handle the rejection anymore. I know it\u2019s a huge mix of people being shitty to me and my own negativity ruining my behavior and I desperately want to break this cycle. At this point I just feel delusional trying to decipher if people dislike me or if it\u2019s all in my head. I had friends in high school that acted like my friends but then would absolutely trash talk me behind my back and I feel like since then I have a really hard time trusting that people actually want to spend time with me. \n\nSo, I guess my questions are; what are expectations I should have for adult friendships? How do I stop feeling so negative and closed off towards relationships? How can you tell if people don\u2019t actually like you vs it\u2019s in your head?\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated, I just want to feel loved by others and have fulfilling relationships and stop feeling so sorry and shitty for myself :/",

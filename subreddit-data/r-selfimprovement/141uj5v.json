No matter how much or hard I try something always gets fucked up and I can't focus on anything except my failure. That's all I am, one big failure. Somehow I managed to get married and have a child but I know it's only a matter of time until I fuck something up with my wife and son too. I don't want to but I know  it's gonna happen. I'm already so mad at myself for not being able to financially support them but I can't get the license for my trade because I can't pass the test. I've gone through 2 years of school for it, worked in the industry for 10+ years and I'm still an apprentice. The passing grade is 70 and I can't get above 69. Each attempt has been worse and worse and I hit the point where I'm done. I don't care.",

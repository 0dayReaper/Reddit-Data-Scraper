    "postText": "from the ages of 8 to 14 I was abused in ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) it really messed me up. I had depression anxiety and anger because of the abuse in ABA, I also had trust issues before going to UMSL and meeting some of the nicest people in the world people who understood me and felt bad for me. ever since I reached my teen years like 13 or 14 my dad starting paying less attention to me and had an affair with my former babysitter, my dad started ignoring me the more I got older and I felt neglected and left out. at the age of 19 my parents divorced. all I want is for a peaceful normal life where I can put my problems behind me.",

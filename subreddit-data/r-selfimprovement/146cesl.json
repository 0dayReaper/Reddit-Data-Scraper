Bernays' idea\r  \n\r  \nSubtle Fake New Articles for an advertisement company? Also Bernays' idea.\r  \n\r  \nStaging controversial events to draw attention? Nah that was actually BERNAYS' IDEA.\r  \n\r  \nAnd during the 1920s, Bernays' joined the tobacco industry and did the unthinkable.\r  \n\r  \nBecause while in it he didn't just explode its revenue and brand awareness all using his wacko strategies.\r  \n\r  \nBut he gained a bucket load of money and introduced a gateway of hope for the entire world to understand.\r  \n",

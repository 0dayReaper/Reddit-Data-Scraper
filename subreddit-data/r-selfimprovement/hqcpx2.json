    "postText": "This is not written by me, but **I HAD TO** share it with all of you, because **this is not some temporary trick** to achieve 30, 60, 90 days target. It is a **step by step** **guide** for the **complete reboot**, to completely change your approach towards quitting porn and tackle PMO in the right manner.\n\nI've shared it in a few other subs, because I want to reach as many people as possible.\n\nIt is extremely long, but trust me, **it will change your whole perspective of quitting this addiction**. Just read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWritten by - TheUnderdog\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Porn Addiction is Being Severely Underestimated\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do I know this?\n\nBecause most people in the community believe that in order to get rid of this addiction, all they have to do is keep trying over and over again, until eventually things will just 'click' and their brains will finally become rebooted.\n\nVery few are treating this as a\u00a0true\u00a0addiction. They just see it as a habit they want to break.\n\nThis is evidenced by the stubborness of many, relying purely on willpower for months, only to constantly reset their counters and beat themselves up for not making any progress.\n\nMost people don't realize how\u00a0incredibly difficult\u00a0it is to completely remove artificial stimulation (of any kind) for the rest of their lives. We're talking about years and years of brain conditioning here.\n\nWe're dealing with some powerful stuff here, but it is not treated seriously enough, probably because it's widely accepted by society and is not a substance like heroine or cocaine.\n\nI cringe when people relapse, reset their counters, and proclaim \"This is it, I've had enough, I'm going to do it this time\"...\n\nStop kidding yourself.\n\nThis is an addiction that has to be attacked from\u00a0many\u00a0different angles. You need a full arsenal of tools and strategies, as well as a proper mindset.\n\nWillpower alone won't do shit.\n\n**Abstinence is\u00a0NOT\u00a0Recovery**\n\nWhat people usually try to do is go as many days clean as they can.\n\nThat's all they do.\n\nThat's all their goal.\n\nThey achieve a certain amount of days, then for whatever reason they relapse, so they start over and repeat.\n\n**That is abstaining. That is not recovering.**\n\nIt is extremely common for people to achieve a certain milestone, such as 30, 90, or 100 days, relapse a few days later, and then find themselves unable to get momentum again. They go back to the beginning and they feel like they lost all their progress from their run.\n\nThere is a constant frustration for lack of progress. People are feeling overwhelmed and discouraged, trying the same thing over and over again without success.\n\nThis is because very few are addressing the real roots of their problems. Very few.\n\nEveryone is focused on how many days they have managed and if their symptoms are either present or gone. They judge their progress by measuring dick hardness, spontaneous erections and morning woods.\n\nThey are \"trying to quit porn\" so that they can \"get rid of their ED\".\n\nSo they abstain for as long as they can, hoping that this can cure their symptoms.\n\n**Completely wrong approach.**\n\nIf they don't see ED improvements, they get discouraged.\n\nIf they see ED improvements, then maybe a porn session or two won't hurt, right?\n\nIf there is no woman around, they justify watching a couple of times. After all, they are not having sex anytime soon, so whats the point?\n\nThey delay dating until their ED is cured or they have managed to go 100 days. But they never achieve this in the first place precisely because of this incorrect mentality.\n\nThe same applies to other symptoms such as social anxiety, energy levels, motivation, etc.\n\nThey try to quit porn, so that the symptoms can go away, and so they can finally live life.\n\nPeople are focusing on the wrong things.\n\nThey are not changing the way they think.\n\nThey are not changing the way they live.\n\nThey are not changing the way they view sex and women.\n\nThey are just trying not to masturbate, while everything else\u00a0remains the same.\n\nThat, my friends, is abstinence, not recovery.\n\nThe Foundation of a Proper Reboot\n\n**Porn addiction is not the cause of your shitty life.**\n\nRead that again.\n\nOf course, it's difficult to improve your life when you're having intense porn sessions every single day that drain your energy and make you a zombie. But porn is not the reason your life sucks.\n\nPlease, this is very important to understand, you have to stop blaming porn for your problems.\n\nThis mentality of *life awaits me after recovery* is\u00a0destructive.\n\nPorn is not the reason you're a procrastinator. Porn is not the reason you're depressed. Porn is not the reason you're lonely. Porn is not the reason you haven't been able to lose weight or gain muscle.\n\n**Porn is the symptom.**\n\nYou watch porn to escape reality. You watch porn to manage your emotions. You watch porn because you're bored, lonely, stressed, depressed, angry, isolated. You watch porn to feel good for a moment, to replace uncomfortable emotions and situations in your life.\n\nHere's how you get rid of this addiction:\n\nYou don't focus on quitting porn so you can finally get to live life after you're recovered.\n\nYou focus on learning how to live, how to manage your emotions, how to change the way you think and view the world.\n\nYou put all your energy into building the life you want.\n\nThis will naturally lead your mind away from porn.\n\nSuccess is not measured by how many clean days you've managed.\n\nIt's measured by how much your life has improved since you started rebooting.\n\nThis is what you need to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step #1: Write a life vision for yourself\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do you envision your life a few weeks, months, or years from now?\n\nSpend a whole day (or week) thinking about this.\n\nDon't say *I don't know what to do with my life*.\n\nAre you telling me you have\u00a0no clue\u00a0what you want in any of the following areas: study, work, family, friends, hobbies, health, etc.?\n\nEven if you're not sure, you need to give your life some\u00a0direction.\n\nThis is by far the most important part of recovering from pornography addiction.\n\nWrite like crazy. Write many pages if you want. Make the biggest post you've ever done in your journal talking about how you envision your future life.\n\nThis life vision will be the foundation of your reboot.\n\nThis is what you will focus on 100% from now on.\n\nClose your eyes. Visualize it. Write it down.\n\nIf you don't know what you want in life, then this is actually a more serious issue than porn addiction itself.\n\nLike I said, spend a whole week if you need to.\n\nBrainstorm.\n\nAsk for advice.\n\nTake a notebook and go to a park.\n\nInspire yourself.\n\nThis is the beginning of your recovery.\n\n**Take it seriously.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step #2: Give urgency to your life vision\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, now you know what you want in life. Even if you're still unsure in some areas, such as not knowing what to study, that's ok. At least you can give your life some direction for the moment. This is very important. You need to give your life direction. You need to move towards something.\n\nHere's the problem. Many of us know what we want, but we keep delaying it. We're experts at delaying goals. We wait until New Years, or the beginning of a month, or until circumstances get better.\n\nSo this is what you're going to do now:\n\nYou're going to give\u00a0urgency\u00a0to your life vision.\n\nWrite down why you ABSOLUTELY MUST start working on it right now.\n\nMake another huge post or journal entry about it.\n\nLet's suppose you're 27 and you have no job, no car, still live with your parents, and spend most of the day playing video games. Why in the world would you wait more time before starting to do something about it? This is urgent bro. You're fucking 27!\n\nOr maybe you've never had a girlfriend in your life before. Well, what are you waiting for? Go buy some nice clothes, start going out more frequently, make mistakes, get rejected, ask women on dates. Start getting some experience NOW.\n\nYou have back pain? Start working on it. Don't wait. The more you wait the worse it gets. Start doing yoga or swimming. Move your hips and back constantly every day.\n\nWrite down reasons why you must start pursuing your life vision right now.\n\nYou have to stop living like this.\n\nThis is urgent.\n\nThis is high priority.\n\nWe must convince ourselves that change is imminent.\n\nIt's very important.\n\nA life vision is no good if you have no urgency.\n\nYou'll just keep delaying it. Waiting for circumstances to improve. Waiting for motivation to arrive. Waiting for the beginning of new year.\n\n**Create urgency.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Step #3: Develop an indestructible belief in yourself\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the main reasons we quit goals is because deep inside we don't believe we're actually able to do it.\n\nWhen successful people like Arnold Schwarzenegger decide they want to achieve something, they become completely\u00a0obsessed\u00a0about it. They have an indestructible belief that they will achieve it.\n\nThey are not affected by circumstances. They create results in their head before they even get them.\n\nThis is what you have to do if you want to accomplish anything.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to learn how to play guitar. And you have the urgency to do it, because you know it takes time, so the sooner you start the better. You have to start now.\n\nHowever, after a few days of learning the basics, you start losing motivation and becoming discouraged. You realize that playing guitar is not easy at all. You feel overwhelmed by how much practice you need to put into it. You start doubting yourself and thinking \"There's no way I'll ever become a great guitar player and form my own band\". Friends tell you things like \"Dude, you should've started years ago. All great guitarists started when they were young\".\n\nSo you quit.\n\nThis is a result of a weak belief in yourself. You don't believe you have the potential to become a good guitarist. Which is obviously completely false. We as humans have unlimited potential.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger doesn't think like this.\n\nLook at what he said:\n\nHow many times have you heard 'You can't do this', 'You can't do that', 'It's never been done before'. I love it when someone says ' No one has ever done this before', because when I do it, that means I'm the first person that's ever done it!\n\nThis is how we should think when we set up to do anything in life.\n\nUncertainty is what kills people. Not knowing if they're able to achieve it.\n\nWe need to brainwash ourselves every day into believing that we\u00a0WILL\u00a0do it\u00a0NO MATTER WHAT.\n\nAll of these steps are equally important.\n\nDo not skip them.\n\nThey are the foundation of your reboot.\n\nThey make rebooting so much easier. Your mind will be completely focused on what you want in life. You will be fixing the root of all your problems.\n\nThe secret of change is to focus all your energy not fighting the old, but on building the new.\n\nStop making posts complaining about your shitty life. Stop making posts saying how you're sick of being addicted to porn. Stop talking about porn altogether.\n\nInstead, transform your journal into a self-improvement journal, focused 100% on moving towards the life you want.\n\n**\"Forget\" about porn.**\n\nThis is basic rebooting stuff, yet many people are constantly breaking this rule. They write about porn cravings, morning woods, spontaneous erections, what day they're on, how much they struggled to abstain, how they can't wait to reach 90 days, etc.\n\nWhen you consistently focus 100% on building the life you want, your mind will naturally move away from porn. You will also lessen the void left by quitting porn, which is very real.\n\nMany people quit porn only to find themselves in this life emptiness that is very hard to handle. Then they go back to porn precisely because this void is too much for them.\n\nFocusing on your life vision is a superior rebooting approach.\n\nRelapses aren't that discouraging if you're actually improving your life. Ironically, you will notice that the more you focus on what you want, the less frequently you will relapse.\n\nIt's important that you think in terms of life vision and pursuing your dreams, not in terms of \"I have to get busy and fill my life with activities so that I don't watch porn\". This is something you're doing for yourself.\n\nStop ranting about porn.\n\n**This journey is about your\u00a0LIFE.**\n\nFocus on that and the porn will go away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Managing Your Emotional Life\n\n# \n\nOk, let's keep going.\n\nPorn addiction is much more than just getting cravings and relapsing.\n\nOne of the reasons we become addicted is because of our inability to manage our emotional lives.\n\nYou have to remind yourself that quitting porn is about growing up and becoming a much more mature person.\n\nIt's much more than *I want to quit porn so I can cure ED and have plenty of sex with women!*.\n\nMuch more than that.\n\nWe've been using porn for years as a method of handling our emotions.\n\nWe need to stop hiding away from uncomfortable life situations. We need to stop using porn in order to escape from reality.\n\nWe must learn how to handle life and emotions without the need of porn.\n\nWe need to understand that one of the reasons we relapse is because\u00a0we're pussies that can't handle negative emotions.\n\nWe use porn as medication. We use porn to hide away from life. We use porn to temporarily relief anxiety, stress, loneliness, boredom, anger, etc.\n\nReadjusting Your Sexual Expectations\n\nThis is by far one of the most difficult things to do.\n\nWhen you quit porn, you're not just saying good bye to artificial stimulation.\n\nYou're leaving behind the world of \"never ending flow of hot chicks with big tits and round asses\".\n\nReal life is\u00a0nothing\u00a0like that.\n\nWe've been spoiled by porn. We believe that we should be out there having lots of sex with different women. We believe that this is the key to happiness and fulfillment.\n\nThe problem is that it is\u00a0incredibly difficult and unrealistic\u00a0to \"fuck hot chicks on a regular basis\".\n\nThere's nothing particularly wrong with having that goal, but you have to be willing to take some MASSIVE action. You have to go through hundreds of rejections. You need to have a lot of balls. **You must do what 99.9% of men are incredibly afraid to do.**\n\nHow many people here are doing what it takes to have the kind of sexual life we all dream about?\n\nVery few, if any. We see these super hot chicks on tight dresses and we hope that maybe\u00a0someday\u00a0we might be able to have sex with them. We read books about seduction. We visit PUA forums. We watch videos on YouTube of guys approaching girls. We make theories and discuss them online.\n\nBut we aren't doing shit about it.\n\nIt's all just a dream. An idea we have in our minds. Something we hope\u00a0someday\u00a0we will do.\n\nHere's how most people get laid in real life:\n\nA guy meets a girl he finds attractive, so he asks her out. They get to know each other. Then they continue to go out and form some sort of relationship. Then after some months the relationship either becomes serious or falls apart.\n\nThat's the real world.\n\nYou have to accept that, unless you're willing to take massive action, you won't fuck anywhere near as many women as you expect to.\n\n**Accepting this is very difficult, but it is necessary.**\n\nWe need to learn how to live without this world of endless hot chicks, otherwise we'll become extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with real life, which is nothing like porn.\n\nAnyone here is more than capable of getting a girlfriend. But our girlfriends most likely won't look like pornstars, nor they will act like them.\n\nThere's a very high probability the sex won't be pornographic in nature. There's going to be a lot of sensuality, caressing, and also clumsiness. Some days your girl will look sexy, other days not so much. Some days she'll be in the mood, other days she won't. Some days you'll struggle to keep it hard, other days you'll cum too fast. She might be able to achieve orgasms, or she might not. You might do it every other day, or maybe only 3-4 times per month.\n\nRemember, pornstars are paid thousands of dollars to do what they're told and fulfill all your fantasies.\n\n**You must stop living in dream land.**\n\nI know this is very difficult to accept,\u00a0but we have to give meaning to our lives outside fucking hot chicks.\n\nOur happiness cannot depend on that. Otherwise you'll keep coming back to porn every time you fail to get laid in real life. You will remain attached to \"sex with hot chicks\" for the rest of your life. You have to change the way you view sex and women, because I can assure you\u00a0it has been completely distorted by porn.\n\nBy the way, I don't believe there's anything wrong about pursuing casual sex instead of a relationship, just make sure you keep both feet on the ground.\n\nI would also like to add that relationships are about sharing your life with another person. I know many people here want a girlfriend so that they can finally start getting laid, but relationships go much more deeper than that.\n\nIf you've never had a girlfriend before you'll know once you get one.\n\nThinking About Sex is\u00a0USELESS\n\nWhat's the point of fantasizing?\n\nIt accomplishes nothing.\n\nIt slows down the reboot, increases the urge to masturbate, and reinforces neurological pathways related to porn.\n\nIt's a meaningless activity that should be eliminated.\n\nIt keeps your mind focused on sex, tits, asses, fucking, when it should be shifted towards other activities in life.\n\nIf you find yourself thinking about sex, you should mindfully and calmly redirect your attention to something else.\n\nYou want sex?\n\nGreat.\n\nThen do something to actually make it happen.\n\nFantasizing by itself serves no purpose at all.\n\nYou need to understand that if you want to abstain from orgasm and masturbation, you cannot be thinking about sex and women, because this will inevitably cause you to relapse. Trying to abstain while at the same time fantasizing or peeking at pictures of chicks will only lead to frustration.\n\nStay away from\u00a0any\u00a0kind of artificial stimulation. Don't take peeks. Don't browse pictures of girls online. Don't type pornstar names on Google image search. Don't read escort forums.\n\n**Do not arouse yourself.**\n\nBasically you have to adopt a philosophy of \"I'm either trying to get laid (approaching, texting girls, going out on dates, flirting with women, hanging out with friends, getting rejected) or doing something completely unrelated to sex (work, studying, exercise, fun, reading, playing an instrument, chores, housework, watching movies)\".\n\nThere is no grey area where you are alone thinking about sex or checking out girls online. This accomplishes nothing. It serves no real purpose. It will only increase urges, lead to relapse, and make you frustrated.\n\nAs soon as erotic thoughts pop up in your mind, you should calmly ignore them and refocus your attention to something else. You keep practicing this forever until you master it.\n\nYou have to attack this addiction right from the root. Trying to abstain from hardcore porn accomplishes nothing if you're still constantly fantasizing and peeking.\n\nIf you keep strengthening the mindset I talked about above, you will be making meaningful progress.\n\nThis used to be called \"Monk Mode\", but I don't like that name because it implies that you're going to become celibate.\n\nThis isn't about becoming celibate. This is about doing what it takes if you want to get laid, instead of wasting mental energy on sexual thoughts that will only improve the chances of relapsing.\n\nIf you ever want to achieve a long streak, you can't be checking out girls online, even if it's just some bikini pictures. You can't be fantasizing when you wake up in the morning. You can't be taking 5 second peeks at porn.\n\nAs soon as you do any of those things, this huge beast called porn addiction will take control over your prefrontal cortex and it's just a matter of time before you relapse.\n\nYou have to be extreme.\n\nBut don't worry, it's much easier than it sounds.\n\nIt's actually harder to stop yourself from relapsing once you're already thinking about sex, than it is to not think about sex in the first place.\n\nHow do you not think about sex?\n\nSimple.\n\n**Focus your mind 100% on your life vision.**\n\nEvery....single....day.\n\nDismissing erotic thoughts as soon as they arrive in your mind is the cornerstone for preventing relapses.\n\nThis is basic stuff guys.\n\nIt's Not Orgasm What You Crave\n\nMany people here believe that abstaining from orgasm is the most difficult part of rebooting.\n\n**WRONG.**\n\nWhen you get porn cravings, your brain is not asking for orgasm. As an addict, it is begging you for your hit. It misses the high, the tits, the asses, the novelty, the rush, the unrealistic sexual scenarios, the fantasies, the super hot chicks, the perfect camera shots, the feeling of letting go and indulging in pleasure, the fucking, the cumshots, the doggystyles, the boobs bouncing around, etc.\n\nIf lack of orgasm was the problem, then everyone would just fap without porn (or any other artificial stimulation). There would be no relapses and everyone would have 500+ day counters.\n\nThe urge to ejaculate only becomes a real problem once you start peeking, edging or fantasizing constantly. When you find yourself in a state of arousal then obviously you will want to cum.\n\nBut the initial urges are \"addiction urges\". They are mental. They are not a physical need for ejaculation.\n\nIf you feed these urges by peeking, even if it's just pictures of hot babes in bikini, then they will invade your mind and rob you of your ability to concentrate or remain calm. Eventually \"autopilot\" mode will be engaged and we all know what happens next.\n\n**You're not having urges to cum.**\n\n**You're having urges for a \"high\" and a \"rush\".**\n\nRemember that.\n\nThis is why porn urges don't go away when you get a girlfriend.\n\nIt is a\u00a0drug, and you need to learn how to live without it,\u00a0regardless of whether you have a girlfriend or not.\n\nWhen you abstain for several days or weeks, your sensitized pathways are anxiously waiting for any sexual cue, no matter how short or brief. This is why people mistakenly confuse real libido with porn cravings. They take a peek at porn after 15 days and they feel this intense rush and urge to cum, so they conclude that it is libido and that they must relieve pressure.\n\nThe problem was taking a peek in the first place. Had they just focused on more important things instead, they would've been able to finish the day clean without problem.\n\nIf you manage to completely abstain from fantasizing and checking out chicks online (in any form), then going a long time without orgasm won't be a problem.\n\nAnd don't even think about testing or caressing your dick.\n\n**Focus 100% on your life vision.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Counters vs Spreadsheets\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following advice is aimed particularly towards those members who are having trouble getting a good run. If you're already doing good, you can skip this section.\n\nOk, here's the thing:\n\nThere is a sickening obsession with long streaks on this forum.\n\nPeople like counters because supposedly they are helpful for tracking progress.\n\nWell, guess what? Spreadsheets do a much better job at that.\n\nThere's a reason why I'm so stubborn with this anti-counter thing.\n\nThey are dangerous, destructive, counterproductive.\n\nCounters reinforce the idea of being \"back to zero\" every time you relapse, making it way more justifiable to binge before starting over again. Not only that, but you completely lose track of how many times you're actually masturbating. They don't show the whole picture. There is absolutely no way to measure your progress at all. It's a never ending cycle of abstaining for a few days and then going back to zero.\n\nEvery time you reset your counter you become increasingly discouraged and unmotivated.\n\nThere's too much emphasis on what day you're on, no fap challenges (there are currently 7 no fap challenges running, it's ridiculous), 90 days, 100 days, etc.\n\nIf you're consistently unable to get past XX days and you're always in the low numbers,\u00a0then your counter has lost its purpose.\n\nCounters are only good when you've managed a good run, because this gives you a sense of accomplishment and provides sufficient accountability to actually prevent relapses sometimes.\n\nNow, let's talk about spreadsheets:\n\n\\-\u00a0They keep your addiction under control: By keeping track of how many times you're actually masturbating and having orgasms, you will be forced to keep it in the low numbers. If you relapse, the spreadsheet will discourage you to binge, especially when you're sharing it with the forum. A good rule of thumb is to try to keep your orgasm count to less than 5 per month.\n\n\\-\u00a0They allow you to see the full picture. In gameover's words: \"You don't realise how you forget over a month how many times you actually masturbate, peek, pmo or orgasm until you have it in front of you. I thought i was well under 3-4 orgasms a month but I have been up around 6-7 and this month was no better.\" You'll be surprised at how many times you're actually fapping.\n\n\\-\u00a0They completely eliminate the \"counting\" factor. All you have to do is keep it as clean as you can. Pretty cool eh? No more counting, no more 90 day goals, no more fap challenges. After all, we're trying to quit porn for life, not just 100 days or whatever.\n\n\\-\u00a0They will never discourage you. If you do relapse, you input it on the spreadsheet and move on. You don't make a new thread called \"Relapsed again\" or \"Not making any progress\". Trust me, if you went from fapping 25 times per month to 2-3 times per month, you're making huge progress, even if your counter only says \"6 days\".\n\nSpreadsheets are\u00a0NOT\u00a0a taper off approach, of course. The goal should always be to never watch porn, to be as clean as you can, to take it one day at a time.\n\nTapering off, as in \"I watched porn 20 times last month, so I'll watch it 15 times this month\", will never work. You should never think like this. You should never give yourself the green light to PMO.\n\nIdeally, you should\u00a0replace\u00a0your counter with a spreadsheet and completely forget about what day you're on. Then, if you do manage to get on a good run, you can put your counter back up for accountability and motivational purposes.\n\nHowever, I understand many people here are in love with their counters.\n\nThey look pretty.\n\nThey are fancy.\n\nI get it, I get it.\n\nSo this is what I propose:\n\n(Once again, this ONLY applies to people who are struggling. If you're already on day 70 or whatever then don't change anything, but consider using a spreadsheet if you do end up relapsing.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo sum it up, the typical rebooting advice of *Hey man, just do a 90 day reboot* is basically useless.\n\nThis is a very serious addiction and should be treated as such.\n\nWillpower alone won't do it.\n\nChange the way you live.\n\nChange the way you think.\n\nAnd please, stop making so many posts about porn, cravings, urges, relapsing, erections, 90 days, etc.\n\nInstead, **focus on the most important thing:**\n\n**Your life.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGotta clarify some things:\n\nI have never said that the reason we\u00a0started\u00a0watching porn was because of life problems. In fact, I would argue that is not the case for the majority of us.\n\nI didn't have any childhood issues or family problems when I was young. I just discovered porn on my own and liked it because it was very pleasurable. As kids and teenagers we are curious and horny.\n\nHowever, as years go by, we become dependent on it not only because of its extreme addictive nature and accessibility, but also because we start using it as a way to cope with life.\n\nThe reason we\u00a0start\u00a0using porn and the reason we\u00a0continue\u00a0to use porn once we're addicts\u00a0aren't necessarily the same.\n\nI also didn't mean to say that all porn addicts have shitty lives. Actually by shitty all I mean is being dissatisfied in one way or another. Maybe you constantly put off your goals. Or maybe you waste a lot of time online and want to change that. That doesn't mean your life is shit. It just means it could be better.\n\nI am completely aware there are exceptions. There is a guy who told me he had no problems getting instant makeouts and fucking chicks the same day he meets them. There are others who actually have incredibly busy lives and only watch porn to get some pleasure and relax.\n\nWhatever your situation is, the main point of my post still stands. You should focus on moving towards what you want, instead of constantly complaining and wasting lots of energy on staying away from porn.\n\n**Concentrate on building the life you dream about and this will help you tremendously on your quest to overcome your addiction to porn.**",

It is really an escape mechanism, I use it when I feel like I'm down in the dump but not in enough to hate myself,watch it and boom I go into self sabotage rampage. \n&gt;The same applies to other symptoms such as social anxiety, energy levels, motivation\n\nIt really baffles me how on other subs or yt videos people mention extreme life changes (I'm more focused, motivated, face glowing, filled with energy etc). I've never felt it, I'm probably more lazy and unmotivated compared to when i watched porn. \n\n\n&gt;Take a notebook and go to a park\n\nStaying indoors is something I noticed to increase my likelyhood of watching porn, coupled with the urge to not get off of the bed!\n\nOne question though, even with writing out goals, any effective approach to carrying them out? Subconsciously, I've always baited myself with \"a journey of a lifetime start with a step\" and I've taken a step by writing it out, and I'm forever stagnant. Anyone dealt with something like this before and how did you upgrade?  \nThank you.",

The usefulness of the counter for me is the fear of setback, which can be a great motivator.

Climate change + the end of human civilization in the near future does not help me get motivated in the slightest. I want perfection but can never achieve it, and reality will never ever be able to match the delusional fantasies I have in my head.\n\nI hate myself so much, and I hate my latent idealism even more, because all it's done is bring me pain upon the realization that this real world we're living in-- this horrible terrible planet full of monstrous humans lacking empathy, forethought, wisdom, or selflessness-- is as good as it gets.",

Although, you\u2019re 100% right about that it\u2019s not the time you spend not watching porn, but what you do with that time to fill that void.\n\nI\u2019ve also been drug free for many years, but the thoughts are so persistent sometimes when I\u2019m doing nothing or are around people who talk about drugs. This post made me question myself... what have I really done to help myself with my problems? The answer was abstain. I\u2019ve done nothing to improve my life as far as filling that void I have within from not using (porn or drugs)\n\nSo I thank you, for opening my eyes.\n\nCheers to everyone who are trying to better your life. I hope we all can succeed.",

Some days I won\u2019t do it, others I\u2019ll masturbate 3+ times a day. Reading this post has made me realize that I\u2019m still battling this addiction. I\u2019ve always thought that porn was THE problem, but that\u2019s just half of it. The masturbation is also a problem.  Even though I\u2019m not watching porn, I still fantasize about scenarios, past pornos, and past partners. I feel like this is unhealthy, and might be even why I get nervous and have performance anxiety when talking or trying to talk to an attractive woman. It\u2019s weird because I\u2019ve always seen myself as a fun guy with a good personality, yet when I\u2019m trying to hit on a girl that I\u2019m super attracted to, I stop being myself. And I hate this. \nAll I want to be is a confident and motivationally driven person, and I think the tips that were given in this post will help me get there. \nThanks for this.",

Please PLEASE dont expect porn to be the real thing even if you know that there is so much trash piled onto those websites . I use a few websites once and awhile but so much of it is cheesy, weird, gross, and meh. \n\nThe guy just thrusts away like some jack rabbit while some thirty year old chick with heavy makeup and wearing just high heels is faking it. Or foreplay is some guy basically acting like hes sanding down the girls gentiles and shes liking it?\n\nNot only are people addicted to it is I am also worried people think that's what sex is supposed to be.\n I've been with a few guys that seem to replicate it and it hurts and is a turn off.",

    "postText": "I(27F) am having problems in my current relationship. My partner does not feel listened to and says that the reason I can't critically think and answer his questions with logical answers is because I am \"hearing\" what he is saying but not listening. I think I may be too absorbed in my own thoughts and opinions to really take anyone else's words into account, especially when I am upset or have an answer in my head already. Any tips or sources for helping me relearn active listening from a fundamental level?",

However I've experienced this many times in my own dating life so I'm not saying that's the case or else I'd also be implying I am one. If this is just a \"healthy\" problem without underlying issues then here's my two cents:\n\nThis will tickle sensitive people the wrong way but generally speaking the form of \"not listening\" you are describing  is attributed to women over analyzing things. \n\nIf I knew the answer to how to fix it I would be a lot happier in general tbh. My most basic/simple advice for any one m or f that does this is to listen more literally. Imho in a healthy relationship you can still be nice and loving without having to sugar coat too much how you talk and shouldn't need to beat around the bush too much either.\n\nHear words more literally. Don't over analyze and/or put your own sauce of what you THINK they are saying.",

It\u2019s not just you, a lot of people struggle to not think about the next thing they want to say when arguing. Everyone is different but there are a few things you can try. \n\nAssertive communication - the idea is to build a foundation of both people being heard and needs being met. With both sides willing to compromise and the focus being on the issue and not a person. This also means taking turns some times with the use of a timer.\n\nGottman institute - there is so much good information on their website for building healthy relationships. They are one of the biggest names in couples counseling and the best part is most of the information is free through their blog posts.\n\nI don\u2019t know the ins and outs of your relationship so I can\u2019t tell you if any of this will work for you. However, I have used these two resources in my practice with positive results.",

Or is he the shy one, but just likes to talk to you a lot only, and you\u2019re having trouble listening because you find what he saying is boring and can\u2019t seem to listen?\n\nI\u2019m asking because you might not have a listening problem, it might be just you losing interest in the relationship.\n\nI find the question odd a female would have a listening problem in the relationship. The only reason I can think of is because you\u2019ve lost interest, but I don\u2019t want to assume things.",

She's a doctor, so super smart, &amp; speaks really fast. She expressed that she felt I wasn't listening to her, cause I wasn't engaging with what she was saying... I worked out that it was because she was talking too fast, so my brain couldn't keep up with what she was saying. My brain was trying to decipher  the meaning behind what she had previously said, while she had moved onto saying something else. I expressed this to her, &amp; to compromise, she makes an effort to talk slower... The problem was solved pretty much.",

I'm sure that sounds quite silly, but actors are trained in listening in order to be fully present in the moment.\n\nIn your conversations, accept that you won't always have the answers or replies immediately in a conversation. It takes vulnerability to admit to someone you need to take a pause to let what they've said wash over you. \"I hear what you're saying. Can you give me a moment to think about what you said?\"\n\nVulnerability is maturity. It sounds like you're on the right path since you're feeling vulnerable enough to ask for help.\n\nMeditation is a great way to slow down your thoughts and declutter your mind. I regularly give out Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind to friends.\n\n\nExamine your motivation for wanting to become a better listener. It sounds like this is coming from a genuine place of wanting to grow. Don't feel strong armed into improving for someone else's benefit.",

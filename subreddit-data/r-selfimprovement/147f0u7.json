            "comment": "Speaking from experience, it's crucial to understand that validation should come from within most of the time.   \n\n\nAs Maya Angelou once said, \"Success is liking yourself, liking what you do, and liking how you do it.\"   \n\n\nYou see, growing up in my own family, I was often left feeling unliked and unvalidated. It took me years of therapy and personal work to understand my own value independent of others' perceptions.   \n\n\nAlso, loneliness can indeed be tough, but it can also be a profound teacher because it compels you to confront yourself - fostering self-reflection, personal growth, and a deeper understanding of your own needs and desires.  \n\n\nMy advice is to try focusing on understanding and liking yourself, and then the right people who appreciate you will naturally find their way into your life. Small town or not, you are enough just as you are.",

I didn\u2019t want to move to this shit town and 2. I don\u2019t have to show \u201crespect\u201d to regular ass humans who think they\u2019re above others and then the security guard pulled me out to ALSO disrespect ME while also claiming I was the one being rude, going on to say \u201cI worked here for 12 years I don\u2019t care who you are blah blah blah\u201d in front of the other new guy and the girl and the two of them mainly minus the \u201cnew guy\u201d kept going at it, towards ME, and again, people may never EVER like you, even if you become rich, famous, chosen by God himself at the Second coming or if the Antichrist picks you to help him rule the world, some people will NEVER fuckin like you.\n\nYOU like YOU, I\u2019m still figuring it out, you\u2019re not alone.

We will all eventually die, and when we do, our physical bodies will decompose and our memories will be lost. This may seem like a depressing thought, but it can also be liberating.

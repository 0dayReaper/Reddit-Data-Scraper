    "postText": "I\u2019ve done so much work on myself so I won\u2019t hurt my SO. I come from very critical,mean,bigoted people and it\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of. I\u2019ve worked hard to try to erase any of the habits and mentality they may have implanted in my but I have caught myself backsliding in some aspects recently. I just had a sobbing breakdown over it. \n    \n  My partner deserves better than a fat phobic, judgmental asshole. I\u2019ve caught myself making comments about others more and more lately and I know it\u2019s directly tied to my unhappiness with my own body and the stresses of my everyday life. I don\u2019t want my partner to have to deal with any of this. They deserve better than what I\u2019ve been. I thought I had gotten over this but any time I start struggling, I feel like this disgusting sewer rat part of myself reappears. It feels like I\u2019ll never stop being that terrible person no matter how hard I work and how committed to changing I am.",

    "postText": "\nHello,\n\nCurrently, I find myself in a situation where I can't find a solution. To provide some context, I'm 29 years old, without a child or partner, and I have a permanent job in IT with a decent salary. However, the problem is that I don't find fulfillment at work, and I don't feel motivated to continuously learn and improve in this field.\n\nAfter work, I primarily have two passions: filmmaking (documenting my travels, adventures, and daily life), but I don't see myself working in this field in the medium to long term. I also have a passion for drawing and 2D animation, and pursuing a career in this field interests me more.\n\nHowever, these two passions that I want to practice daily become burdensome because they take up a lot of time. I've tried choosing just one, but quickly I feel a sense of sadness for not being able to pursue my other passion. Similarly, I feel the need to practice both of these passions every day and not alternate between them every two days.\n\nI would appreciate your help in figuring out how I could merge these two passions.\n\nThanks you",

What I do is try to at least doodle something every day, even just basic 3d shapes just to reinforce the fundamentals from that, and I keep track of it by using a habit tracker. I work a busy 9-5 and I also read, meditate, exercise and work on my projects every day, and I attribute that success to being able to physically see my progress by checking it every day\n\nHope this helps!",

            "comment": "To merge your love for filmmaking and drawing/animation, consider exploring animation within your filmmaking projects. Add animated elements like intros, transitions, or short sequences to give your videos a unique touch. And don't worry if you can't practice both every day\u2014set specific time blocks for each passion to maintain fulfillment. By dedicating focused periods, you can make progress in both areas.\r  \n\r  \nBy the way, have you heard of the Forfeit app? It's a cool tool that helps you stay accountable by adding a fun twist. You set tasks for yourself and if you don't complete them, you lose a little bit of money. It can provide an extra push to stick to your goals and overcome procrastination. Give it a try and see if it helps you stay motivated and on track with your filmmaking and animation endeavors!",

    "postText": "I\u2019m 19 from the UK. I\u2019m doing university online, I have no job, cut off all my high school friends I have literally no one to talk to about this.\n\nI\u2019ve been in this same fucking position since 2020 and I\u2019ve done nothing about it. Literally all my day consists of is waking up and sitting at my computer. THAT IS IT. I fucking hate myself for it and it\u2019s warranted in my opinion. \n\nHow the hell do I get to live in comfort for 3 years, have no responsibilities, have everyone do everything for me when people literally half my age are providing for their families in some parts of the world. It fucking disgusts me that I\u2019m this useless. Point I\u2019m trying to make is I know these are supposed \u201cfirst world problems\u201d and majority of people have it worse than I do in this world but I have feelings man I\u2019ve put up with this \u201cmen need to be strong\u201d bullshit for too long.\n\nI want to be clear on what I want to achieve with this post. I know most likely nobody will see this so I\u2019m putting this out there for at least my future self to come back and hopefully look at this and reassure me that these were my worst years living.\n\nTruth is, sitting in your home for 3 years STRAIGHT isn\u2019t as glorious as it seems. It\u2019s fucking draining to say the least. But what am I gonna do about it? Nothing. Just how I always am whenever I have these thoughts.\n\nIt\u2019s probably clear to anyone reading this I have Social Anxiety and Depression. I mean what can you really expect. One thing about me is that I\u2019m so fucking ambitious it\u2019s insane I know what I want in life  but I just CAN\u2019T do it. I care about what others think of me, what they say, how they look at me, I feel like a fucking outsider in this society. I have body dysmorphic disorder, I don\u2019t feel comfortable in my skin, how I look, how I act. I\u2019m a big guy and the biggest thing I fear is scaring people since I have that resting bitch face all the time. My body is literally unable to process what a smile is.\n\nBecause of these insecurities I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll never find someone who loves me or fuck that actually, just SOMEONE who appreciates me. All in all I just want a fucking girlfriend. I\u2019ve ALWAYS been told by my family that I am attractive (no shit they say that) but having BDD isn\u2019t about reassurance, I just don\u2019t feel comfortable with my body.\n\nNow to be fair being isolated for 3 years means I have literally no experience. So I may not have been accepted by any girls, but I haven\u2019t been rejected either. \n\nI\u2019ll try to list some good qualities. I\u2019m 6ft 2 and my family and old friends say I have a good personality and also empathetic. My opinion it\u2019s been worsened with isolation but I\u2019ll take it. That\u2019s it\ud83d\udc80\n\nThis whole post is such a mess I haven\u2019t thought this through at all. Sorry in advance if another person ends up reading this. I\u2019ll go way more in depth if someone replies and try to be more coherent.",

With social anxiety I thought, I won\u2019t be able to do this. Turns out if I just stuck with it I could do it and it was fine, and I met people and socialized and it was good for me. I would suggest doing something similar.\n\nAlso seeing a mental health professional would be a great idea. Therapy helped me greatly. \n\nIn terms of not being confident with your body image, I\u2019m sure you have heard this but working out is great for this. I\u2019d suggest a weightlifting routine 3 days a week, eat a good amount of protein, stick with it and you\u2019ll be more confident and receive all of the other benefits such as improved mood, better sleep, etc.",

I\u2019m such a perfectionist with things I commonly do so when I\u2019m presented something new if I\u2019m not the best at it in at least a few days I get so downbeat and have negative thoughts rolling through my head. \n\nBut if you were in the same place I am now in life your advice is literal gold to me. I\u2019ve started working out at home but it\u2019s obviously not as efficient as going to the gym. I just need to get over the anxiety factor (same with the job). \n\nCurrently booked a therapist appointment which is in a week or two. Thank you for your advice and for reading my post.",

Even if you volunteered for free for an hour a day it'll increase your mood, enable you to socialize and get out of the house.\nAsk an elderly neighbor or relatives if they need assistance with something, help around the house, errands, etc. These are little things that will help you break the cycle, stay positive and keep going forward.",

The more important thing is the action itself and the genuine behavior.\nDuring COVID a lot of people developed antisocial habits which sounds like what you are developing at the moment so it is going to take time but start with something small and build up from there, it sounds like you also have agoraphobia which is very common among people your age. The most basic first steps to initiate would be to talk to people via phone for example and then slowly develop an extrovert personality, this will take time though but do not give yourself pressure and have negative thoughts about people judging you or worrying about the negative outcome. Don't worry about the \"what if\" and just take action, the first steps are usually the most difficult.",

This isn\u2019t an easy task, but, like anything, with work this predicament can be removed.\n\nThere are other needs that can easily be fulfilled. Such as meeting the correct requirements in nutrition and sunlight exposure. Doing the right amount of exercise daily. Socializing with other humans in real life. Getting enough sleep. Relaxing and reflection. \n\nAll those things help cure the vicious cycle that the mind might put it self through.",

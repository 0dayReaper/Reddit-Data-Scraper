    "postText": "You are responsible for everything in your life. Good and bad. You have the key, you are the key. You have control over yourself. Over your thinking.\n\nSo talk back. Talk back...to the negative voices, the judement, the hyper-focus on what's going wrong. Talk back...to the tech giants who profit off your every waking moment by turning off notifications, removing all social apps from your phone (even email, yes it's possible! anything is). Talk back...to big pharma who wants to treat your, depression, ADHD, and obesity that they created, so they could take it all the way to the bank for the rest of your life. Talk back...to them by taking control of your own health, mental and physical. Talk back...to the self-help gurus profiting off your 'misery' and, instead, become the source of your own happiness and growth. Talk back...when you try to victimize yourself with what we have become so expert at doing in America, and realize that they want to keep us weak and self-pitying so they can get us to buy whatever it is they're selling to fill the bottomless hole they say we have.\n\nIt's all in your head. Woo hoo! That means: you have the power to change it...ALL.\n\nIt's a chemical imbalance, but even that can be changed (try psychedelics or yoga or meditation!! not medication. All of that can open neural pathways and rebalance the brain too. Try anything that doesn't involve you giving money to the beast that profits off imprisoning you). You have the key to your chains!\n\nWhat if...we are all here as a test? Those who can overcome this mad world unlock the next level, and those who don't have to suffer another round. Could be... \n\nWake up, throw all the shit away (stuff, people, meds, food) that causes you suffering and realize that it's you. YOU are holding the key, and you've had it all along.",

            "comment": "You are responsible for certain parts of your life. Morality is one of them because the only things that good and bad aren\u2019t circumstances but your own actions. You have final say over what you do. \n\nYour thinking is not up to you but how you respond to your thoughts is. You can assent (agree with) what your saying or you can be skeptical if it\u2019s true. \n\nPeople fixate on what \u201cmakes sense\u201d. One issue is that the logic we have doesn\u2019t reflect reality, that we believe things to be true that aren\u2019t and value certain things to an unhealthy degree. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to demonize tech, pharma, \u201cgurus\u201d and what not, but those things have their uses. Even a spoon can be dangerous if you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s for. Any tool can harm you, but it can benefit you too. \n\nWith respect to some of the points, you\u2019re unnecessarily villainizing things in order to spurred someone to empower themselves not realizing can contribute towards the \u201cvictimization\u201d you\u2019re saying to not give into. \n\nPeople have the capacity to change their lives, definitely, but it\u2019s not a matter of will, it\u2019s a matter of understanding and humility. If there was button to \u201cfix\u201d this they\u2019d hit the button, most people don\u2019t understand how to deal with the impressions they\u2019re presented with and think they \u201cknow\u201d what to do, hence a lot of the shame and regret. \n\nIt\u2019s a complex issue for sure.",

But, then again, we also don't. We can't stop thinking, no matter how hard we try... so then whose thoughts are they? I do 'think' that we can change our thoughts. I've gone through periods in life where they're primarily negative and then I did a lot of talking back to them, and now I look at the bright side more than not. \n\nDefinitely agree about the potential positive and negative side of all things, from pharma to spoons.\n\nI've seen a fair number of posts on here that are very deep in their self-pity and victimizing and that mindset is just going to generate more misery. I know from experience. \n\nThe 'fix' button I've found really is to talk back to 'my' thoughts and so many of the forces around that seem to be against us. It's done much more for me over the years than therapy and medication. Changing my very thoughts. \n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts!",

I split it up into things we have final say over and don\u2019t. \u201cControl\u201d is using what we have final say over one stuff we don\u2019t but our focus must always comes back to those things that are up to us. \n\nFor most people they don\u2019t have thoughts, thoughts show up and they agree or disagree. The issue is the identification with thoughts and not their assent. \n\nThoughts are contextual and over time the things we refer to in our mind can change but that comes as consequence of how we respond to what we\u2019re presented. \n\nTherapy is a trained person pointed out that here internal judgments and for people that can\u2019t spot their own self talk it\u2019s great. \n\nI mentioned the button in the context that people don\u2019t change from a lack of desire to, just a lack of understanding.",

Teaches you how to be more stoic and keep an air of strength and authority to you. Plus, it's a great thing being able to be someone's support, be the shoulder others cry on. Being strong when everyone else is crying allows you to support others and help others be strong themselves because you can be stoic when everyone else is crying.",

A real man can show kindness, empathy, compassion, doesn't mean you need to cry every time you feel like you need to.

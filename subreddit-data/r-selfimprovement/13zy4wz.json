    "postText": "I\u2019ve been divorced for probably about 4 years I don\u2019t even remember. Anyway I have 2 kids young 7/5. I have joint custody of them everything is 50/50 and I have them every single weekend. I do everything for them yet they don\u2019t call me when they are with their mother but when they with me they call their mother nonstop. It hurts me cause I didn\u2019t have a \u201ccomplete\u201d family. I don\u2019t know my father so that made me want to keep my family together so bad yet I got screwed over in court. Yes I pay child support. I started my own business and was doing well for a couple of years and I was on top of child support. I was over paying but then things started to slow down and I began to fall off and fell behind on child support and all my bills. I know that I\u2019m a male and people don\u2019t care about men problems we just have to keep pushing. So instead of me complaining about the system or situation I try to be strong. With me falling behind on child support they have suspended my license and now I can\u2019t work with me not working I\u2019ve lost my business cause I\u2019m a truck driver. I\u2019ve lost everything my car my trucks no money coming in so I can\u2019t provide. I\u2019ve taken care of my ex wife for 5-6 years with no help on 1 income. Not once has she tried to help with anything yet she\u2019s found a new guy but now she\u2019s working and helping out with bills. She\u2019s moved in with him with my kids. I\u2019ve become a weekend dad no job no car no money no business yet I still try to provide the best way I can. This is extremely difficult to do. I\u2019m 32 B/M. I\u2019m not suicidal but I\u2019m starting to push my kids away. I can\u2019t deal with them talking to me every single weekend about things that they are doing. The excitement in their voice cause they are moving into a new house etc\u2026I just want to disappear sometimes but I know it will hurt my kids so I put myself through the pain. I don\u2019t care that much about her anymore it don\u2019t bother me much anymore what she\u2019s doing who she\u2019s having sex with it\u2019s none of my business but jeez when will it end? I just go through so much pain and heartache so many ups and downs trying to get back on my feet. How do I get better? I must get better? This isn\u2019t how I pictured my life.",

    "postText": "I don't mean being \"easily distracted by social media\". What I mean is being easily distracted by sounds, smells, taste in my mouth, touch etc. Basically I can't filter my senses.\n\nI get so distracted, that I can't focus on anything, it's like they are \"disturbing my thoughts\", like someone constantly shouting into your ear while you try to do a task (like studying, playing chess or Dual N Back, etc).\n\nInterestingly enough, earplugs do not help me. They block sounds, but not my other senses. To be honest, white noise helps a little better, especially because I feel as \"if I'm getting a brain massage\". \n\nWhat are other ways to cope with that?",

I'd recommend trying out a few free apps like Headspace, Calm, or Balance. There's a few to choose from, and you can keep trying other ones till you find one you like. If you don't like guided meditations then you can just sit down somewhere really quiet, set a timer, and just focus on nothing but your breathing. If a thought comes, let it, and then just go back to focusing on breathing. Start by only doing 5-10 minutes a day. If you have questions you could check out r/meditation and they'll be able to give you some more tips",

He goes into insights you can get from meditation that may not come to you without being pointed out\n\nIt's a great way to build a strong foundation of skills you can use and build on all the time. Meditation isn't about sitting down to meditate. It's about being outside on your way to the grocery store or work and stopping sometimes and not thinking about the shit you gottta buy at the store, but just being, appreciating the current moment of reality, which is you sitting on this gigantic rock hurtling through space, falling forever towards a cosmic nuclear fussion engine blasting brilliant energy out into the cosmsos\n\nAnd im out here on this rock feeling that brilliance on my skin. Listening to the wind rustle in the trees, the trees which literally eat sunlight. And birds flying up onto those trees\n\nThen getting in the car and driving around to wherever you gotta go and look at some more birds and shit\n\nYou can get the app free by googling \"Waking up scholarship\"",

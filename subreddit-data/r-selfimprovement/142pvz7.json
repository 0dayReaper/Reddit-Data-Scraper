    "postText": "Every time I'm at a low in my life, where I feel lost empty or stuck I suddenly get this random burst of fire inside of me and I envision myself achieving all my goals.\n\nSo I do the same loop of making a big plan  while listening to the rocky soundtrack but when it's finally time to follow through I can only keep up for 2-3 weeks. This is so frustrating because I feel like I'll never be able to achieve anything special the way I am. What am I doing wrong that is causing to be like this\n\nMost of my ambitions are related to fitness and sport, I have all the knowledge I know exactly what I need to be doing but for some reason I cant stay consistent with it",

            "comment": "I totally get the frustration of losing motivation after those initial bursts of fire. Here's a tip: try breaking your fitness goals into smaller, more achievable tasks. It'll help you stay consistent and build momentum.\r Now, here's a nifty app you can check out called Forfeit. You set goals and attach a small monetary forfeit to them. If you don't complete the task and provide evidence, you lose a bit of money. It's like having a mini bet with yourself to keep you on track.\r Remember, consistency is key, but it's okay to have off days too. Just don't let them derail your progress.",

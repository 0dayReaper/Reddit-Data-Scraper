Think of it as a partial dopamine detox",

One thing that could help is using the Forfeit app. It's this cool app where you gotta send proof of completing a task or you lose money. So, you could set small goals like reducing screen time or trying out new activities, and if you don't follow through, you lose a bit of cash. It adds that extra motivation to stay on track and break free from the gaming and movie marathon.",

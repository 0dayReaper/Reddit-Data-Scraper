The transition that is probably more important is becoming your dad, the one creating these plans. \n\nWhat\u2019s the issue with trying stuff and it not working the way you intended? At least in your specific case it might make sense to do the \u201csub-optimal\u201d way so you develop that part of yourself of exploring.",

            "comment": "To develop a diet plan, start by understanding your caloric needs and the macronutrients (protein, carbs, fats) your body requires. I recommend you to consult with a nutritionist to determine your specific needs. Focus on incorporating lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables into your meals while moderating your calorie intake.\r  \n\r  \nWhen it comes to working out, it's important to have a well-rounded routine that includes both cardio exercises and strength training. Make sure you're targeting all muscle groups and gradually increasing the intensity of your workouts as you progress. \n\nI have a suggestion that might help you stay motivated and accountable: consider using the forfeit app.\r It\u00b4s an app that allows you to set daily goals and tasks for yourself. If you fail to complete a task or provide evidence of your progress, you lose a small amount of money.",

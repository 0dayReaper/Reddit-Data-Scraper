Russian forces in Zaporizhia Oblast are continuing to defend against Ukrainian attacks in accord with sound tactical defensive doctrine.  \n1. Russian milbloggers continue to highlight reported superior Russian electronic warfare (EW) capabilities as key to disrupting Ukrainian attacks.  \n1. Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces have tactical advantages in conducting assaults at night due to Western-provided equipment with superior night optics systems.  \n1. Russian sources continue to highlight the role of scarce military district-level Russian TOS-1A thermobaric artillery systems in defending against Ukrainian counteroffensive operations, though Ukrainian forces destroyed at least two of these key systems in recent days.  \n1. Ukrainian forces are currently attempting an extraordinarily difficult tactical operation \u2013 a frontal assault against prepared defensive positions, further complicated by a lack of air superiority \u2013 and these initial assaults should not be extrapolated to predict all Ukrainian operations.  \n1. Chechen Republic Head Ramzan Kadyrov established a clear rhetorical line between criticizing the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) and criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin.  \n1. Russian forces targeted a Ukrainian operational airfield during another missile and drone strike on Ukraine on the night of June 9 to 10.  \n1. Russian forces made marginal advances northeast of Kupyansk and continued ground attacks near Kreminna.  \n1. Russian and Ukrainian forces both continued ground attacks in the Bakhmut area.  \n1. Russian forces continued limited ground attacks along the Avdiivka-Donetsk City line.  \n1. Ukrainian forces continued limited ground attacks near the administrative border between Donetsk and Zaporizhia oblasts and have made marginal gains in the area as of June 10.  \n1. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced on June 10 that it plans to formalize the organization of volunteer formations.  \n1. Russia is further consolidating a centralized media apparatus in occupied areas.",

No, he does flag it in the post, and he has a good track record of flagging the same quality of content throughout the whole length of the war.

I'm one of the most anti-hype people in this live thread on most days, but I give DefMon high marks because he doesn't pass it off as true information. Sometimes people want to consume the rumors. It's fine as long as they understand that they are rumors. Information hygiene is less about ignoring or dismissing less-than-reliable information and more about accepting its limitations and remaining cautious.",

            "comment": "Igor Girkin, former \"Seperatist\" (Russian) commander and convicted war criminal continues to post his opinions on the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive. This is as of the previous few days and may not reflect information that is current \n\nIt is his opinion that Ukraine has not yet achieved wide success in the counteroffensive and also describes how Ukraine was unable to capitalize on what success it has. He predicts that the longer the initial phases of the attack go on, the less success they will have as Russia can commit more reserves to that area of the line. \n\nHe further predicts that if Ukraine cant achieve a breakthrough, they will reposition their forces to attack somewhere else, like towards Svatove. He believes it isn't impossible for Ukraine to break through, but its unlikely, and as he puts it \"depends simply on the supply of ammunition and equipment in the attacked area\", further he states that following this counteroffensive, Russia will not have the manpower or resources to conduct their own offensive.\n\nWhile this is just his prediction, it rings eerily similar to what actually occurred last year during Ukraine's Kherson and Kharkiv counteroffensives.\n\nIn Kherson at first Ukraine achieved no success in breaking the Russian lines, and the offensive stalled significantly.  Then on a weaker area of the front, Ukraine massively broke the Russian lines and exploited the advantage very effectively. It would take weeks more for Ukraine to finally liberate Kherson, and it was primarily because Ukraine was able to deny Russian soldiers resupply on the right bank of the Dnieper river  (By blowing up all the bridges/ferry crossings and pntoons)\n\nWith this information we could somewhat predict what may happen with the rest of the counteroffensive. In the next 3-7 days if Ukraine isn't able to achieve success in Zaporizhizia they will likely call off the counter offensive there, fall back and return to a status quo of longer range artillery duels to degrade Russian forces.\n\nAfter which those units will probably reposition to another area of the front and attempt a breakthrough that will likely be more successful, particularly in liberating smaller settlements and a wider area of land. This could be Bakhmut, It could be Svatove or even areas around Donetsk itself. Such an attack wont be as strategically significant as liberating Meltiopol or Mariupol, but is far more attainable with fewer losses.\n\nFollowing this, Ukraine would probably settle into a period where they attempt destroy to Russian logistics as best they possibly can. In the mean time, the offensive brigades would rearm and refit from whatever losses they had sustained. Then possibly attack in the same area they did in Zaporizhizia, this time with more success.\n\ntl;dr: this offensive may end up looking a lot like the offensive we saw last year, in good ways and bad ways. This depends upon similar factors like western arms shipments, and Russian logistical issues.",

No-one here knows anything about the offensive.  Period.  Wait a week or two.  Or 3 or 4 or 5.  Jesus, the people here are pathetic.",

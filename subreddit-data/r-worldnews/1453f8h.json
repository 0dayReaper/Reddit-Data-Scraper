(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; Poland was one of two countries to vote against new migration and asylum rules approved last night by EU member states.\n\n&gt; Four countries - Bulgaria, Malta, Lithuania and Slovakia - abstained from voting and only two opposed the plan - Poland and Hungary, which have long rejected the idea of relocating migrants and asylum seekers - reports Polish state broadcaster TVP. In 2020, they, along with the Czech Republic, were found by the European Court of Justice to have violated EU law by refusing to take in refugees under a previous quota system.\n\n&gt; Speaking yesterday to TVP, Polish deputy interior minister Bartosz Grodecki argued it was unfair that the EU had provided the equivalent of around &amp;euro;200 per Ukrainian refugee to countries hosting them but was now asking countries to pay &amp;euro;20,000 for each relocation they refuse.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1453jd3/poland_condemns_eu_migration_and_asylum_pact/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688316 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **country**^#1 **Poland**^#2 **refuse**^#3 **Polish**^#4 **state**^#5",

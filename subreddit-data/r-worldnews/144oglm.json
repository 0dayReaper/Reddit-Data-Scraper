The western media largely towed the pro Russian line of \"Ukrainians and russians are all the same anyway, there's probably a large portion of pro Kremlin Ukrainians in the east\". It largely swallowed assertions that there were no russian troops in Crimea until putin himself boasted about their key role in annexing it. The british and the post soviet block have been the leaders in confronting these assumptions and exposing the true nature of Russian actions in the region. Britain having had people poisoned by russians on home soil, the post soviet countries having suffered considerably at the hands of their former soviet occupation. The US's view (largely due to its own divisive domestic politics) hasn't even had an anti-russian president for a large chunk of that time. It's had to have its views informed by countries like those in the East of Europe who have had skin in the game.\n\nIf it wasn't for the vast amount of aid the US has provided, I'd would say it's involvement on the side of Ukraine has complicated things. Because it's allowed people like you to point the finger at a country for which many around the world already harbour a hatred and are ready to believe it has offended again. A country which has played no other part than to arm Ukraine against a neighbour that seeks to wipe it off the map. If you must blame someone other than Russia, at least get your story straight.\n\n\n&gt;Actually, ukraine violated the Minsk agreement and started shelling the Donbas.\n\nThe LPR (russian backed) and the DPR (also russian backed) never ceased hostilities in the Donbas in accordance with the Minsk Agreement. Activities to which Putin would have been intimately familiar. Putin then declared the Minsk Agreement null and void, an action that he should not have been able to unilaterally decide if Luhansk and Donetsk were truly independent states, before in invading the rest of Ukraine from those regions and from Belarus which is incidently where the Minsk Agreement was drawn up. See how disingenuous all of this is?",

The US didn't shape this conflict.\n\n\n&gt;Bush and Iraq, or because the Iraq\u2019s don\u2019t have blue eyes, their undeserving of sympathy and aid?\n\nBy all means, lay into bush. Dude should be tried as a war criminal. Iraq didn't knock over the world trade centre. The whole war on terror was ridiculous.\n\nUkrainians aren't a race of exclusively blue eyed people though. That is ridiculous. Nor does the US only ally itself with blue eyes or any other variety of eyes. If you've ever been to the US, you'd notice a variety of eye colours in the country itself. Including those from middle eastern countries. I'm not going to pretend the country doesn't have racism though. All countries do. It's a flaw with the way the human mind tries to find patterns in everything and slam everything into categories. It's just a cave man way of thinking that effects a certain portion of every country.\n\n&gt;All I know is, if America minded it\u2019s own business\n\nOut of the choice of possible superpowers in the last 100 years, which would you rather? Russia? The USSR? China? The USA? Or perhaps the UK? Not having one is not an option. The power vacuum *will* be filled.",

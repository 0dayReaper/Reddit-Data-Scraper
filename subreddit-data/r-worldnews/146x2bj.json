But that collaboration went about as far as dividing up the country in between them, whereafter they quickly turned on each other. Russia was basically buying time to prepare their troops, Germany was hard at work trying not to let Hitler\u2019s stupid ideology drag them into another war on two fronts. \n\nThere was no love lost between the communists and the nazi\u2019s. The only reason they didn\u2019t attack each other was because both preferred to buy some more time. \n\n&gt;\u201dThen got bailed out by the Allies!\u201d\n\nWhat are you even talking about, man? The battle for Stalingrad was the *first* battle the nazi\u2019s lost. The royal ass whooping dished out by the red army is considered *at least* as big a turning point as D-Day (which only happened about a year later). \n\nOf the 70-85 million lives lost during WW2 roughly 30 million were lost on the Eastern Front. The Russians didn\u2019t get \u201cbailed out\u201d at all. You might even argue they faced the worst odds of any nation during the war, and they beat \u2018em. \n\nLet me be clear: I\u2019m not at all on Russia\u2019s dick here. What they\u2019re doing at the moment is pointless and horrendous. However, you can\u2019t go around spouting your USA propaganda bullshit in which the war was won solely by Western nations. \n\nAlso: Russia was *part* of the Allies. Moron.",

Check this guy out.\n\nThe Russians and Nazi's traded military technology during a time when this was banned by the Treaty of Versaille, the Russians \"only divided the country between them\" and then committed mass crimes against humanity against the Polish people living there, had a plan to divide Europe taking out several sovereign nations, committed mass genocide in Ukraine, purged over 20 million of their own people, invaded Finland, and then the Nazi's stabbed them in the back. The only reason the Russians were on the ally side is that they distracted the Nazi's while the rest of the allies invaded from the West. Many times the Nazi's tried to team up with the allies and warned them about Stalin and multiple Allied generals even said they should have continued the war to take out Stalin with Paton going as far as essentially predicting the future of what Russian atrocities waited.\n\nYour post is a complete and utter joke and spin on reality. Serious, \"they only divided the country between them. Sounds like you support Russia taking out Ukraine because thats the same path and they used to same excuses to take out Poland. Also all of those 10's of millions of \"Soviet\" death came from Ukraine and Belarus. Stalingrad wasn't the first Nazi loss either. \n\nWho is this guy? Putin, is that you?",

I am sorry for you in regards to that but I guess ignorance really is bliss. You quoted me as saying '\"why are you buying oil for your people who are just trying to put food on the table and have a per-capita income of $2K compared to $60K in the west?\"' I'm not sure why you would attribute a quote to me that I never said. Honestly making a fake quote is a weird way to argue but it's ok, you do you. You had another quote after that and I never said that sentence either so I'm really confused but maybe not as confused as you. Are you arguing with someone else or are you making up things and saying I said them?\n\nIt's weird you think I only care about myself. Honestly if it was your people being invaded I'd take the same stand against the invaders. I don't know where you are from but let's say you are from India. If China invaded India I would say the world should come together against China. If during that war Sweden increased their trade with China and then held a conference and invited the leader of China but not the leader of your country, I would say people should boycott Sweden. Would you feel differently then? Or would you say \"you know what? I know China is raping and murdering my friends and family but I don't think the world should really make that big of a deal out of it because it's really not their problem.\" Is that what your position would be? If that's how you feel about a genocide then I'd hate to be a friend of yours.\n\nDo you feel like the world shouldn't have been worried about the Jewish genocide in WWII? Or the Genocides committed by the Japanese during WWII? Should the world have just said \"ya know, that's not really our problem. Nazis are good to do business with so it's ok if they kill people for no good reason\"",

I have no skin in that game only to say it makes sense if the intent of the original scripture leaned that way.

It's spread by people who want to follow the Bible but don't want to admit it says such an awful thing. Trying to say \"The Bible isn't really homophobic, guys!\" is an attempt to say we can still base our morality on the Bible.",

If the author intended to refer to catamites, he failed miserably. It also says to kill both participants, which implies it's not talking about some kind of sexual abuse. Leviticus was written a long time ago and there is no contemporary commentary on it, but at least by the first century it was definitely regarded as banning sex between adult men, as both Philo of Alexandria and Josephus ([source](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0216%3Abook%3D2%3Awhiston%20section%3D25)) talked about it that way. Progressive Jews and Christians don't want to admit their holy texts say something so awful, so they pretend it doesn't say what it plainly says.",

There is lots of revisionist nonsense out there trying to conform a 2,000+ year old text to 21st Century moral values but the reality is it is just that: revisionist nonsense.\n\nYou may however be thinking of the event in Matthew 8 and Luke 7 where Jesus heals a centurion's \"pais\". This term was sometimes used in Greek to refer to a catamite.",

            "comment": "&gt; PARIS, June 9 (Reuters) - French shoppers should pay less for their food from next month, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Friday, after he secured a pledge from 75 food companies including Unilever (ULVR.L) to cut prices on hundreds of products.\n\n&gt;The companies, which together make 80% of what the French eat, could face financial sanctions if they don't follow through, Le Maire said.\n\n&gt;The government is furious that supermarket prices have hit record levels in recent months even though the costs of many raw materials used by food producers have been declining.\n\n&gt;Improved harvest prospects have helped push the United Nations' index of world food commodity prices to a two-year low.\n\n&gt;France's finance minister has previously threatened to claw back what he described as \"undue\" profits from food companies with special taxes if they did not pass on their own lower costs to consumers already struggling with high energy bills.\n\n&gt;\"As soon as July, prices of certain products will go down,\" Le Maire told BFM TV on Friday, after meeting food industry representatives a day earlier.",

If a monopoly or similar is the only way to get economies of scale necessary to bring down costs to a reasonable level, then might as well nationalize and save the costs of paying the CEOs, shareholders, and the government apparatus necessary for adequate oversight thereof. But all industries tend towards monopoly or monopsony, absent regulations limited only by sources of friction like transportation and communication costs, and so just because an industry has coalesced into a small number of colluding firms does not mean that it should be nationalized. Breaking up large enterprises where there is adequate space for multiple competitors, as for example was done with AT&amp;T, can generate innovation and solve the monopoly problem without the need for nationalization.",

Plus they surround themelves with only like-minded indoctrinated people to get a sense of comfort and validation out of their shared beliefs, making it even harder to get them to question any of it. And even if by some miracle you manage it, as soon as they go back to their indoctrinated social circles they have their old beliefs validated and become even more entrenched than they were before. \n\nIt\u2019s a real conundrum and unfortunately I don\u2019t know any way to solve it.

I\u2019ve lived in Hertfordshire, Chiswick, Thames Ditton and Frome. All we\u2019re almost impossible to see a GP and had month long waits for scans etc. \n\nI waited like 6 months for a scan for a trapped nerve in my arm back when I lived near Bath. I was in agony. \n\nI\u2019m not saying France is perfect of course but my personal experience of living in the both the UK and France I was quite shocked how functional and efficient some services can be here. \n\nMy only complaint of France is the education system is very dated. They have a weird attitude of zero screen time for kids as they equate using a screen to entertainment and don\u2019t accept it can be educational and valuable too. I was surprised at how many of our friends with kids don\u2019t own a computer or a tv. Their computer is a smartphone!",

We had a home computer from 1991. We had three TVs at home so I always had a screen I could watch if I wanted. We had cable/satellite so I had dozens of kids channels. I'm all for limits on screen use. I have a 10 year old son and he has restrictions on how much Switch and PS5 he can play as unlimited anything is rarely a good thing. But *zero*? That is just weird to me personally. \n\nBut of course my views are biased compared to most. I am a software developer and my wife is a video game producer. Our jobs are 100% computer based and worse we work with video games! We've been playing video games with our son since he was young. He's been able to type on a keyboard for as long as he's been able to read and write. During the pandemic I taught him Python and C# so he could make things with Unity like his mum and me. He writes his own emails to his grandparents, etc. He can research subjects he is interested in. He writes stories and draws pictures on the computer. Recently he started keeping a daily journal which he loves to look back at and tell us stories of things from months ago. I don't consider any of these things bad use of screens. Quite the opposite tbh.\n\nBut who knows perhaps I am the wrong one but in my mind teaching a child how to productively use the tools in the world is important. I don't want him to turn 13 and suddenly have unlimited screen time (which is basically what the French guidelines are as there are no restrictions from 13!) with tablets, phones, computers, consoles, etc. I want him to know how to use them for both fun and serious work.\n\nAs I said I 100% agree with some limits and to teach children to use these tools properly. Using them to keep a kid quiet is lazy (although it is exactly what my parents did with me as a kid lol. If they were busy they would tell me to go play on my Game Gear!) but that isn't a problem with the screens but with the parents imho.",

Hard languages are Ubykh in the northwest Caucasus and San in Namibia. The most difficult living languages in Europe hands down are Polish - the grammar is phenomenally complicated and there are a lot of different sounds which are hard to keep apart at first, and most Poles do not use their own language properly -, Irish Gaelic - hard grammar, difficult spelling rules, and the co-existence of a bunch of dialects with sometimes widely varying grammar and vocabulary which you have to know to some degree in order to talk to anyone who does not sound like a lazy, improperly written textbook, plus a ridiculous standard language which was made by committee and has imposed spelling reforms which make understanding older documents harder - and Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian, and Basque, not because their grammars are super hard, in fact, they are pretty intuitive, but because they have their own words for everything, you are going to have to relearn the whole world. \"Police\" in Hungarian is rendorseg - sorry, I cannot type the umlauts and accents here. Icelandic and Faroese are somewhat easier.  \nThe most complex languages ever to arise in Europe, and possibly anywhere else in history, are Ancient and Classical Greek. They are the most difficult languages I have encountered, harder than Sanskrit, harder than Arabic by a long, long way. Chinese is hard only because of the writing system and the tones for speakers of non-tonal languages. Greek has an absolutely astounding verbal system, with categories many languages lack, a variety of dialects, and ridiculous degrees of nuance in the use of particles and grammatical forms, plus ambiguity in the use of nouns and adjectives. Greek makes Latin feel like a programming language in comparison.  \nFrench does have a ridiculous number of idiomatic expressions which are in use, so there will be that to deal with.",

When you go above like 50 people, what people are making vs what people want becomes untenable to just share because of labor value vs the liquidity of the goods. So money is invented, trading, markets. I know it will hurt to hear, but supermarkets are a good thing for food producers, because the producers (or the consumers) would otherwise have to do that themselves, which is the reason an organising entity like a supermarket exists.",

There\u2019s no real \u2018taking pride in food culture\u2019 \n\nNow, withthe general trend in the world\u2026it\u2019s getting ridiculous.\n\nTbf, Im Belgian, living here for 10 y. So, take that into account. But I seriously miss the pride taken in the food you prepare, and hate the hyper commercialism of food here. \n\nAll the effort goes to the convenience and money making og the company, instead of the experience of the customer.",

Britain got bombed to shit in WW2 but the country itself wasn't a war zone and wasn't occupied, and war rationing still outlasted the war by a decade. France took the brunt of it for the Allies in WW1, and were still bleeding when WW2 came about.",

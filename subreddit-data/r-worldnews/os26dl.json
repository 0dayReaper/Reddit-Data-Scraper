Our officials like to swallow public funds so a lot of thriving filipino athletes you see are either lucky/skilled enough to get a sponsor, or are part of thr upper middle class and above. \n\nI did 8 years of taekwondo and I don't think any of our athletes ever got state sponsorship even though they were really good. To think that mcdonalds and milo sponsor our athletes more than the government does... shameful \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21",

Ten years on, she has recurring dreams of these men, but can never remember if they're real, and what exactly happened right after she left the house - before she found herself safe at home in part 1. Then as she's preparing pancakes for her overly cute twin daughters and husband who's too late for work to eat them, the doorbell rings.\n\nIt's the child! Who is no longer a child, but a man, and he now speaks perfect English.",

Just because you beat the world record holder in A competition, does not mean you now have the world record. I have not looked into it but since the articles I've read specify she broke the Olympic Record, and not say she broke the World Record, I assume that the Silver medalist from this Olympics still holds the World Record.

All it did was mean that there was a strict curfew, people had fuck all to do in the evenings as you couldn\u2019t really go out anywhere due to said curfew and he seemed to crack down hard on prostitution by criminalising and stigmatising it.",

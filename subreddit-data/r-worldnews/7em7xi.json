You don't know however what it contains beforehand.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"The combination of money and addiction is gambling\", ruled the gambling committee. VTM News brought the news and a few days later EA withdrew the function from the game, partially because Disney complained, which has the rights to the Star Wars merchandise.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGeens now wants to prevent that these kinds of functions will be in any games going forward. \"But that takes time, because we'll have to make a proposal to the EU. We will definitely try to ban it.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: changed some wording for clarification and accuracy.\n\nEdit: Thank you random stranger for my first Reddit Gold! I am glad I was able to help you and so many other people  with my translation so much that you gifted me Gold. It is greatly appreciated and I hope you have a great day like I will now have.

There's no pressure on companies to change/improve that way.  \nDoing it on the EU level means a the entire EU market is affected, and companies will feel that.  \nIn the end, I doubt banning is ever going to happen. At least not directly. But I can see it being regulated:  \nIf your game has a function that requires money and is a game of chance (lootboxes) your game must be rated for Mature audiences. Game/service must also validate the customers age (like casinos).  \nBasically, casino regulations on games with lootbox mechanics.  \nGames with direct microtransations will be fine (maps, skins, etc).

Fifa, one of the biggest franchises in the gaming industry makes a very good portion of it's money from the ultimate team gamemode.

The fact is, loot boxes are a form of GAMBLING and it SHOULD NOT be legal for kids to gamble.\n\nThese game companies have been able to get away with this for so long. IMHO it is on the same level as selling cigarettes to children. It should not be legal and it should never have been legal.\n\nWhen the kids become adults, they can make informed decisions and gamble as much as they wish. While they are children, however, they should not have the temptation thrown into their face.",

Not only would they have made as much selling only cosmetics (there could have been so many cosmetics in the game), they arguably could have made even more. Especially if they take something like 2% on all things sold on their marketplace like Valve does. To this day people are still trading and purchasing skins from sellers for cosmetics that came out 4 years ago. Not to mention all the lootboxes purchased every year. And no one would be batting their eyes. ",

Everyone uses theirs, so you can just mini-crowdfund one person to have them all. \n\nNot saying I condone it, just that they're not EA.

                            "comment": "Yes.\n\nBecause if you take away the virtual item veil, it can be easily translated to: Input $1.00 for a potential of $1,000.00 (or more). \n\n\nI know this isn't how LoL works exactly, but let me try to lay it out using that as an example: Lets say you get a bunch of loot boxes &amp; keys on your account - you spent a total of $100.00. You unlock all your boxes and !!! woah! You got a super rare discontinued Jax skin that only 10 other people have. You look up how much your account is worth now - !!! woah! Now it's worth $3,000.00. Or...let's assume you didn't get anything. But you are soooo sure that you can get that rare skin so you spend $100's and $100's of dollars on it, you start becoming obsessed with getting that skin because surely if you just could get that skin you could stop spending so much money and you could just quit and be happy with the game and then one day - YES! You did it! $15,000 later, ruined friendships, lost time, and it turns out you get extremely depressed because that skin that was worth $3,000 is now only worth $5 because the creators of the game flooded the market to discourage the black market.\n\nedit: Like I said, LoL was a bad example, but the general idea is that this sort of thing can cause people (children especially) to learn extremely dangerous spending habits. \n\nedit 2: Everyone is bringing up the idea that your account will be banned if you trade it. I have bought and sold accounts from many games in the past, never had them banned. That doesn't happen often. Virtual item sales are a huge market. \n\nedit 3: This has created quite a large discussion, of which many people have made great points. The main question was simply : Are games that offer loot chest (like CS:GO, LoL, etc) also participating in gambling? Of which I replied Yes. **of course** there is the loophole that allows it to happen because everyone technically gets something, and people are also making the case that it is similar to trading card games - I totally agree. However I also believe that it's (as I put it earlier) Gambling-lite\u00ae. Conditioning kids to love that dopamine hit from getting pack after pack after pack and then FINALLY YES A CHARIZARD. Now I must get 1,000 MORE packs because I hit that 1:1000 chance of getting it. Same shit with OSRS. People spend days and days grinding that game just to HOPEFULLY hit that RNGJesus. \n\nedit 4: The main issue I have with this is that yes - if you are an adult and you want to spend $15,000 on anything, that's your prerogative. The issue comes in the form of children who play these games who may not know the value of a dollar and blow their parents/their own money on it, which can lead to issues with budgeting in the future. \n\nfinal edit: I do not really believe that loot crates are an issue. I enjoy earning little boxes of goodies from playing, and I enjoy what I get out of them. My only concern is that you can pay real money to get them, and that adds an entirely different angle to the entire thing. Loot boxes are harmless - you get rewards for playing - but when you tie them to money...it's a new beast. ",

However, most of us are very poor at keeping track of how that small investment compounds over time; we tend to see it as a series of small separate investments rather than one investment that keeps growing and growing every time we add to it. By the time we\u2019ve noticed how much we\u2019ve lost, we realize we got caught up in the excitement of the possibility of winning and lost a ton of money in the process.\n\nThis is the same reason microtransactions are so successful. $3 here, $2 there - before you know it you\u2019ve spent $60-$100 in a month because you perceived them as separate, small investments that couldn\u2019t possibly have a big impact on your finances.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make you stupid, it makes you human.",

            "comment": "My 2 cents on whether it's \"gambling\" in New Zealand (I'm a newbie lawyer, but not in this area, and haven't looked up any cases, just the legislation) - \n\nAccording to NZ's Gambling Act 2006 - \"Gambling means **paying or staking consideration**, directly or indirectly, on the outcome of something **seeking to win money when the outcome depends wholly or partly on chance**\".\n\nIf it isn't already outlawed, the key issue is whether the person is \"seeking to win money\" or simply paying for an item that is selected at random.  I ***firmly*** believe that the only reason this is uncertain at all is because the law hasn't kept up.  If made aware, its more than likely that legislators would specifically cover loot box systems in the Act.\n\nWhat is ***fucking outrageous***:  I know *for a fact* that winnings from loot boxes are **technically** taxable under the Income Tax Act, in rare and specific circumstances.  This would only be the case if you:\n\n1. sold the prizes for a profit; AND\n2. had a \"system\" to reliably make a profit (as opposed to simply having a lucky streak).\n\nThis also means that losses (buying duds) would be tax deductible.\n\nHow can something like this be caught by tax laws but not by gambling laws?\n\nI emailed the New Zealand Gambling Commission last week, and will call if I don't get a response soon.  I will be notifying the incumbent government too and see if we can't get some legislative clarity.\n\nI think everyone should do the same for their countries (contact the gambling authority and the legislators).  If you're American, I wouldn't bother - your system is way too corrupt and it is a waste of time.",

Unless EA drops some *serious* and i mean *really* serious money to some less scrupulous member nations to block this (doesn't have to be directly, opening up a huge \"game development\" studio in an impoverished member nation and scoring political points for the government would net them some pretty adamant protection in political forums) we are still looking at a dragged out and arduous process of getting a EU-wide consensus with various EA lobbyist interfering.  But it's *on fucking record* and we can drum up mainstream media support, right now though, what EA does is really shitty, because US will be getting micro-transactions based Internet access.",

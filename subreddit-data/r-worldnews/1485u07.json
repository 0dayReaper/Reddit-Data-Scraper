[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's just flat out genocide in real time.\n\nRussia is objectively trying to wipe Ukraine from the map completely.  Kill the language, kill the nationality completely, and kill anybody in Ukraine now who isn't willing to completely be repatriated as Russian entirely.",

'trumpism' is something that is partially crafted by the FSB and in some ways it resembles Russian thinking as those are the authors of a lot of the streams of though that Trump's followers are fed.\n\n(while the former KGB tried hard to push propaganda into the US, for the most part their efforts led to fairly total failure.  only in the last 10-15 has their successor finally gotten good at things, although the ground work for their success was laid in the 80s)\n\nAt the same time, you're ofc right.  What makes Russia Russia can't be put into a bottle and grow perfectly in any foreign soil.  This is part of why they largely failed in their efforts in Europe and the Americas in Soviet times... propaganda so rigid with no sense of adapting it to each individual country.\n\nIn some countries (many, really), Russia has learned to adapt their ideas to local streams of thought and have become much more effective.  (Not all of the FSB's efforts work... some of the election propaganda in 2016 was just as bad as the 1950s KGB stuff... like the HRC as Satan fighting against Jesus.  although to be fair i have idiots in my family who loved it despite it not really fitting into any US natural streams of thought).\n\nso yeah, tl/dr, Putinville and Trumpville would look totally different as \"mature\" dystopias, although there may be some shared ideas between them.",

I was one of 100 American students and we all met up in DC before flying out to Frankfurt. There was a girl of Ukrainian descent that sat a group of us down and essentially schooled us on Russian and Ukrainian relations. She kept stressing that Russia would absolutely try to conquer Ukraine in the next 10 years and we, young, educated, worldly-minded bilingual people needed to be ready to help Ukraine. I distinctly remember her drawing that gold symbol, which I now see on bumper stickers, on a napkin for us to all memorize.\n\nAt the time, she seemed kinda crazy and alarmist. Now, I keep going back to that conversation. She was right about everything except the timing, and she was only off by a few years.",

Many Russians would also recoil from a pile of dead bodies.  But the German citizens were very aware of them.\n\nThe myth of the \"innocent German\" was created after the war by the US who wanted to gather support to rebuild Germany.  That involved stopping de-Nazification, pouring money into West Germany, and working with Nazi government officials who were in power.\n\nSo the US started a propaganda campaign that it was a small cadre of shadowy individuals who had been punished.  Those people were villified (and to be fair they were the fucking worst) and the rest were absolved, as if they didn't know about it.\n\nThe fact is, it was obvious.  The ghettos were built in German cities.  Jewish people were used as slave labor, millions of Germans worked near Jewish slaves or used the products of Jewish slaves, or just saw slaves as part of their daily life.  Jewish property was confiscated and redistributed to Aryans, it wasn't hard to figure out what happened when the Jewish corner store owner vanished and was replaced by a blonde-haired, blue eyed guy who proudly displayed the Nazi flag in his window.\n\nThe German people were very aware. They largely cheered it on or were neutral to it.  \n\nWho do you think all the Righteous Among Nations are?  Psychics?  Mutants like Professor X?  Fortune tellers?  No, they're German citizens, who saw an injustice, and rather than do nothing, they tried.  Anne Frank was harbored by her neighbors in the cellars, what do you think they were hiding her family from, exactly, the Holocaust they didn't know about?  They knew.  And so did every one of their neigbhors (one of which informed on them)",

No no no, it's about national security, we swear. \n\nSo, Russia just doubled the lenght of its border with a rapidly militarizing NATO. After a year of a half of NATO saying those were off the table Putin has convinced us of sending F-16s and long-range missiles. Ukraine is bombing Moscow with their own drones, Ukraine-backed Russian insurgents are roaming Belgorod, and Russians are dying by the tens of thousands in foreign soil. Don't even start with the ethnic Russians in Ukraine they went there \"in order to protect\". And they insist everything is going fine.\n\n\nAnd what does Putin have to say about it? He obsesses over a XVIIth century map, where he misses Ukraine's name is clearly written on it, and rambles about a golden era with a grand unified Russia, like an absolute megalomaniac with delusions of grandeur",

                    "comment": "&gt; It baffles me how everyone here just assumes Russia did it, although it has almost nothing to gain from blowing up the dam.\n\nWhat Russia gains is another layer of defense against Ukrainians crossing the Dnieper river just when they were starting their counter-offensive, which is more than the nothing that Ukraine gets from blowing up the dam. And that's even assuming they could blow up an enormous concrete structure that they weren't in control of. Certainly missiles wouldn't suffice to destroy the dam, so if Ukraine did it, then how did they do it?\n\n&gt;it was exactly the same with the Nord Stream destruction, everyone assuming Russia did it, but now that nobody cares anymore it became obvious that it was the US/Ukraine\n\nNo actually it is pretty obvious that nobody knows who did it even now. And Russia will remain at the top of the list of suspects because it's very much fits how they operate, they had a lot to gain from the attack and it's hard to explain why one of the Nordstream2 lines was left untouched since the only country that benefits from doing so is Russia.",

US satellite footage of an explosion on the dam. Norway recorded seismic activity consistent with massive explosions from that direction at the time of the destruction. Russia was the country with control over the portions of the dam that were destroyed. And every expert I've seen says the dam could not be destroyed from the outside without prolonged attacks or more advanced weaponry than Ukraine has. \n\nAnd where do you get the idea the US or Ukraine are the ones responsible for the Nord Stream sabotage? I've seen this a lot lately and it all seems to point back to someone finding DNA of a Ukrainian guy on a rented yacht that may have been in that area. If that's the case I recommend you look more into it because the yacht would have been too small to carry the amount of explosives needed to blow up that line, plus would also not be able to use the equipment needed to get those explosives set in place.",

There is nothing Ukraine has that could do that.

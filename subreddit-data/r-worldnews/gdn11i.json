And the tribe offers a ton of free public cultural classes, during normal times.\n\nBest thing you can do is work for the tribe if you\u2019re looking to feel like a part of the tribe. They\u2019ve got a mentality where if you share the mission you\u2019re a part of the family. It means a lot more to make an effort to pick up the language and culture than to have a card for most people. Better to live it than flash an ID.\n\nReally the only thing you miss out on without provable heritage are the programs and services. Those are admittedly nice. There\u2019s a department dedicated to helping people trace their heritage back. You might give them a call.",

There used to be lots of German language communities in the US but most of them disappeared once speaking German and identifying as German started to be looked down upon. German used to be close to the status of Spanish in the US today.\n\nBut some people are just straight up weird about identifying considering my ex had a German last name, has grandparents who grew up not fluent in but still hearing a good deal of German and yet he pretty much only identities as Irish.",

Granted, I was only raised Catholic, I\u2019m not religious at all, I just always remembered this story:\n\n\n41 Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. 42 But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.\n\n43 Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, \u201cTruly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. 44 They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything\u2014all she had to live on.\u201d",

One of my other favorite Jesus stories is the one where he flips over the tables of a bunch of guys making money off of religion. They were set up selling animals for sacrifice right outside the temple. If I remember correctly he used a whip as well to drive them away.",

It could be argued that our poor understanding of the native tribal situation (Not simply being a big \"Native American\" monolith) could have gone some way into confusing people into who they were donating towards. Somewhat demonstrated by the very mistake in the article. You end up in a situation where I think people accidentally \"paid it forward\" rather than \"paid it back\" if that were the case. I don't know how Choctaw might feel about using their kindness for an otherwise unrelated charity or how donators might feel about a very meaningful cultural debt (there is literally a pic of a user's dad having a Choctaw tattoo in those tweets) being used for may be seen as misdirection.\n\nUltimately people who are in need may get help, so I hope it's not undone.",

I've seen comment that we are ignorant and racist to lump all Native Americans into the same group. And that we are short sighted to assume Choctaw = Najavo. Most people here know that these are different peoples, separated by hundreds of miles within the continent that is North America. But the one thing we all have in common (Ireland, Najavo, Choctaw, all native Americans) is that we have all suffered greatly from colonialism, we've all had out land taken from us, we've all been forced to relocate (Trail of Tears, To Hell or to Connaught), we've all been brutalised and murdered by a larger power. Irish people sympathise with that, and this is a case of paying it forward, not paying it back.\n\nWe will gladly never settle this debt with Choctaw, and I imagine anytime the Irish learn of an indigenous people suffering, we'll be there to give a helping hand.",

            "comment": "As an Irishman, the story of the Choctaw donation to the Irish famine relief has always had one of the most profound effects on me. \n\nFor context, from what small amount I know of the Choctaw's struggles, their relocation through the Trail of Tears happened during 1830-33 (broad dates) while our famine was approximately during 1845-49. The Choctaw tribe had experienced thousands of deaths during relocation and were about as destitute as one could imagine. I think that makes the donation all the more powerful. These people had nothing except for heartbreak and betrayal and when the plight of others reached their settlements they rallied together to give almost everything they had. All this born out of the understanding of pain the Irish were suffering and not wishing to see another race of people face those same torments. \n\nI'm not one for big internet posts or to get too emotional about this sort of stuff, but there's a special place in my heart for the Choctaw tribe and other Native Americans. I think it's one of the purest examples of the kindness and solidarity of people, something the modern world has forgotten a bit too often.",

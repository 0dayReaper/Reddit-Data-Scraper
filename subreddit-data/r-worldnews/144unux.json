And unfortunately, military equipment that cannot be destroyed has not yet been created. \n\nBut today's wars take place in two dimensions - real and informational. Information battles are no less fierce. And they also have certain tasks, rules and laws. For example, any party to an armed conflict seeks to show the enemy's losses and classifies its losses during the active phase of hostilities. Why?\n\nBecause the more information about the enemy is publicly available, the easier it is to calculate their capabilities and plans. In addition to intelligence, which is now very difficult for the Russians on our territory, there are other ways to extract the necessary information by throwing provocations into the information space. \n\nIn this way, you can force the other side to give out as much information about itself as possible. For example,by encouraging justifications and refutations. To do this, very inflated figures are thrown at us in the expectation that we will indignantly begin to refute and give out some data or indirect references to them. Or, for example, information about the disappearance of the Commander-in-Chief or other commanders is being thrown around, expecting comments and refutations with photos and videos showing where they really are. \n\nTherefore, we must understand that we are fighting with information, just like the enemy.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DenesTorteli/status/1667072251324248064?t=asGJbLFCTdBxRSCji6hRWA&amp;s=19",

He seems to be the type who responds by backing down to safety when up against potentially-dominating / potentially-deadly power.

I think he believed Ukraine would be a cake walk; his intelligence apparently advised him that Ukrainian resistance was weak, and that Ukrainians would welcome their tanks and new rulers with open arms, etc.\n\nI sense weakness/reluctance in him, in his reluctance to mobilise more.  He's got himself into an awkward corner.\n\nBut that might be balanced by (i) a patient/steely determination that he also seems to have, and (ii) who knows what distorted 'information' and advice he's receiving...",

Did you think losses don't look like this?\n\nThe reason you see the Bradley mess is because Ukraine has the power to be attacking one of Russia's hardest points. So it's a sign of power, not weakness.\n\nThe mess seems to have happened because the probably newly trained drivers didn't stay exactly in the mine clearing lane. That happened because Ukraine has the power to train up and equip with great systems a huge number of new troops. This is also a sign of power.\n\nWe are talking about one company's equipment out of maybe 50 companies. The Bradley's are a small fraction of the force. That's how powerful this attacking force is. \n\nAnd lastly, the great thing is, those new drivers can get supplemental training on how to stay in the lane because they are still alive. The reason they are alive is because they have great equipment and great training that kept them alive and evacuated. Russians can only look at this and WISH their army was half this good.",

Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in least four areas of the front on June 9, making further gains around Bakhmut and in Western Donetsk.  \n1. Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged on June 9 that the Ukrainian counteroffensive recently began and noted that Ukrainian forces still have offensive potential, a departure from previous Kremlin efforts to downplay Ukrainian counteroffensives.  \n1. Contrarily, much of the Russian information space prematurely claimed that the Ukrainian counteroffensive has failed after Russian forces damaged more Western-provided Ukrainian military equipment on June 9.  \n1. Ukrainian officials directly acknowledged that Ukrainian forces expect to suffer equipment losses during counteroffensive operations.  \n1. The Russian command structure responsible for areas of southern Ukraine is unclear and likely overlapping.  \n1. Russian forces carried out missile and drone strikes across Ukraine on the night of June 8 to 9.  \n1. Several independent sources reported additional evidence that an internal explosion likely destroyed the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant (KHPP) dam on June 6.\n1. The White House revealed on June 9 that Iran is helping Russia build a drone manufacturing factory in Yelabuga, Republic of Tatarstan, Russia, underscoring the growing military cooperation between Tehran and Moscow despite Western sanctions.\n1. Chief of the Russian General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov discussed increasing Russian-Chinese military cooperation with Chinese Central Military Commission (CMC) Joint Staff Department Chief of Staff Liu Zhenli on June 9.  \n1. Russian and Ukrainian forces conducted limited and localized ground attacks south of Kreminna.  \n1. Russian forces continued ground attacks near Bakhmut and on the Avdiivka-Donetsk City line.  \n1.

You can get maybe 5-7dB reduction at most using coatings without unduly increasing the inert weight, though I don't think these were used on the ATACMS, apart from probably the nosecone &amp; fins.",

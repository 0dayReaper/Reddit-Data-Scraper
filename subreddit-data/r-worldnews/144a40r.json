That is because if you assume Russia is entirely irrational, then it could decide to use nuclear weapons because Putin received an even, rather than an odd, number of apple slices in his breakfast cereal tomorrow morning. And, moreover, the available evidence supports the claim that Putin is minimally rational and competent, but receives curated information and is liable to strategic miscalculation.\n\nThat means we have reason to treat him as imperfectly rational and competent in developing our response to his actual and predicted strategic moves, and, indeed, we must do if we are to develop any strategy that takes into account his likely objectives and strategy to achieve those objectives.\n\nGiven that the use of strategic nuclear weapons would result in Russia ceasing to exist as a nation, I believe that Russia would not resort to their use unless there was an existential threat to Russia or Putin's regime in Russia. That would not occur were there a deployment of NATO forces to Ukraine.\n\nGiven that there are no good military targets for tactical nuclear weapons, and their use would result in their loss of support from China and India, I believe that Russia would not resort to the use of tactical nuclear weapons in any event.\n\nTherefore, though we cannot say for certain that Russia would not use nuclear weapons were there a direct and limited engagement between NATO and Russia in Ukraine, we can say that it is probable that it would not occur.\n\nAs such, we should not act as though there is a probability of Russian nuclear escalation where there is no more than a mere possibility that it might eventuate.",

Luna was a painter towards the end of the Spanish era of artwork, which on a timeline is a rather large swaths of space (1520\u2019s-1900). During this time you\u2019d expect to see lots of religious based artworks in many of the Spanish and Italian styles. \n\nThe American era only lasted a few years after 1900, but it brought out landscapes and still life works inspired by American influence. WWII brought the Japanese era which as you could guess was a lot of propaganda and war related stuff. I\u2019m just touching on the painting arts. There\u2019s notable individuals in all the arts (sculpture, architecture, folk arts etc..). \n\nI work in medicine and nursing is jokingly almost as cultural as lumpia, so I\u2019ve had many Filipino teachers early on and subordinates later in my career. They literally love to share any and everything with you about \u201cback home\u201d. Even though most are citizens by choice or birth of the US, many still see the Philippines as \u201chome\u201d. Most I know send regular care packages back home for their relatives and in turn get a little of home sent back. \n\nNames for you to check out (painters, potters, architecture etc..various eras)\n\nDamian Gabol Domingo is considered the father of Filipino painting. \n\nJulie Lluch Dalena\n\nFernando Amorsolo\n\nFabian de la Rosa\n\nGuillermo Tolentino",

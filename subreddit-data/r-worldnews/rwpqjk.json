He also spoke about different migratory patterns, and well he now sees different whales than he used to, it left him pretty terrified for the next couple decades. \n\nThe trip was great, but the tone of that guy who ran the whale watch was bleak.\n\nHe also cooked some fish we caught on the boat, and the moment he figured it was done, he said \u201csplit it up amongst yourselves, I\u2019ve got another tour to go to.

We went to an area that sees a fair bit of tourism and a major (for Greenland at least) airport but geologically speaking, it's almost entirely unknown and unstudied except for a couple studies in the 70s that were done by boat and satellite. Two of my friends were looking specifically at some formations that could potentially have some sort of Rare Earth Element (REE) content that could potentially have an economic purpose. IIRC, the formations did have traces of REEs but not enough for a mine. My project was largely unrelated to that and was more about figuring out the timing and placement of these formations compared to other formations our supervisor had previously studied.\n\nSo to answer your question, there's a fair bit of mining in exactly what you're asking and from what I remember, you're also correct in that it's hard to extract.",

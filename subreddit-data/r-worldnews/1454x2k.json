(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; About 300 infants, toddlers and older children have been rescued from an orphanage in Sudan&amp;#039;s capital after being trapped there while fighting raged outside, aid officials said Thursday.\n\n&gt; About 300 children at the Al-Mayqoma orphanage in Khartoum were transferred to a &amp;quot;Safer location&amp;quot; elsewhere in the northeastern African nation, said Ricardo Pires, a spokesman for the U.N. children&amp;#039;s agency, UNICEF. Sudan&amp;#039;s ministries of social development and health have taken charge of the children, while UNICEF has provided humanitarian support including medical care, food, educational activities and play, Pires said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\n&gt; Their relocation followed an online campaign led by local activists and international charities, which intensified after the death of 26 children in two days at the orphanage in late May. The children had been trapped in the fighting for over seven weeks as food and other supplies dwindled.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/14555ri/unicef_says_300_trapped_children_rescued_from/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688327 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **children**^#1 **Sudan**^#2 **orphanage**^#3 **including**^#4 **fighting**^#5",

My heart goes out to their families and loved ones. It's important to support organizations like UNICEF who work tirelessly to help children in need around the world. We may be strangers on the internet, but let's take a moment to send positive thoughts and energy to those affected by this tragedy.",

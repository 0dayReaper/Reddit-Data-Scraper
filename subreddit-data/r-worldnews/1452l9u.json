Ronald Regan was a great president, being what this country needed 43 years ago. Remember Glastnot? \n  Now, the people of Ukraine are fighting back. Putins military are deserting him.

This is a blatant attack against Ukrainian sovereignty dividing them on ethnic lines.  \nThis will back up Hungarian narratives of their false / pretended peace efforts, and will provide support to vetoing of putting Kirill Patriarch on list.",

Hungary has declared that there are Hungarian minorities in Ukraine. And that Hungary has claim to a bunch of west Ukrainian territory.\n\nOrban expected Ukraine to fall and Russia to erase the country from the world map. And he expected to be given Ukrainian territory as a payment in order to stay neutral. \n\nHe and putin are both fucking mentally challenged morons who's entire world view revolves around drawing bigger and bigger lines on a map.

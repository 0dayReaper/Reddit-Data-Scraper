The Democrats campaigned against the PATRIOT ACT in 2006-2008. They won the Presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives. They had huge majorities across the board. Instead of rescinding it or rolling back some provisions, they expanded it and made it permanent. Not to mention they also expanded the FISA warrentless wiretapping, made the Bush Tax Cuts permanent (after claiming that those tax cuts had destroyed the economy) and passed the Iraq Troop Surge.\n\nIf you have both houses of Congress and the Presidency and you are still passing shit bills, you can't blame the other side.",

The act broadened the surveillance capabilities of U.S. law enforcement agencies as it relates to identifying potential terrorists, and many of its provisions have been opposed by liberal Democrats and civil libertarians.\n\n&gt;It wasn't the first time Biden took credit for the Patriot Act . On Meet the Press that same year, he made similar comments referring to the Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995.\n\n&gt;\"I introduced the terrorism bill in '94 that had a lot of these things in it,\" Biden again said.\n\n\nhttps://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/andrewkaczynski/surveillance-joe",

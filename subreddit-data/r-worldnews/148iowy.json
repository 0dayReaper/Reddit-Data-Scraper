[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "comment": "The study suggests only 33.3% benefit from this protocol. Unimpressive.\n\nMindfulness Based Therapies show greater overall efficacy and yet, in this study, the authors conducted parallel meditation exercises to show greater efficacy of their attentional training program. How does that work?\n\nYou can search YouTube for \u201cattention training\u201d to familiarize yourself with several examples of these techniques. This is an area of special interest to me. I feel I know why their protocol yielded such disappointing results, but I need a closer look. If you\u2019re in this lab, please reach out. Your efficacy can easily double.",

Symptoms seem to generally fall into categories of stress-mediated behaviors, but what people present with are behaviors that have already been modified by learning and real world challenges. So no one checks all the boxes. There are no working blood assays or gene identifications, so reported behaviors are wonky and will cluster in distinct and less distinct categories.",

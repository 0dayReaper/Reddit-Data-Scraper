I looked it up and the IPA for Uman is [\u02c8um\u0250n\u02b2], which is different than the [\u014b] usually used do describe the ng sound. I don't really know what that j is doing, but  I can't hear much of a difference even I listen to myself saying the name and a video of its pronunciation.",

I'm no linguist, but I love to learn about these kinds of nuances and how each language develops them.

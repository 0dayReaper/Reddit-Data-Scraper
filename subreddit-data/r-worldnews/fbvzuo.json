            "comment": "\"A conservation group has closed a $15.65 million deal to buy the largest privately owned giant sequoia grove left on Earth, an ancient forest with hundreds of the endangered redwood trees, which can live for 3,000 years and rise nearly as tall as the Statue of Liberty. Due to its size, health and age diversity \u2014 with sequoias ranging from seedlings to Methuselahs \u2014 this grove represents \"the most consequential giant sequoia conservation project of our lifetime,\" according to the group's president.\n\nKnown as\u00a0Alder Creek, the grove covers a seemingly modest 530 acres (2 square kilometers), but that's a big deal for giant sequoias. The iconic trees once lived throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but they now exist in only 73 isolated groves, all located on the western slopes of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. This particular grove packs a lot into its 530 acres, including 483 sequoias with trunks at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter, along with a few hundred smaller sequoias of varying ages.\n\nThat age range is a big reason why this grove is so valuable, according to Sam Hodder, president and CEO of Save the Redwoods League (SRL), a century-old California nonprofit that's been working to acquire Alder Creek for more than 20 years.\n\n**\"Many giant sequoia groves are just a single age class, usually in the thousands,\" Hodder told MNN when the deal was announced in September 2019. \"In this one, a real indication of its health and resilience is that there are giant sequoia of all age ranges.\" While any remaining giant sequoia grove is a rarity, he adds, \"it's rarer still to have multiple age classes, and such a healthy forest ecosystem.\"**\n\nSRL signed a purchase agreement with the Rouch family, which has owned the grove since the 1940s. That was a big step after two decades, but the sale wasn't official \u2014 until now. There was the small matter of $15.65 million, which SRL had to raise by Dec. 31 before it could take ownership. The group did that with a public\u00a0fundraising drive\u00a0on its website that rallied for help right up to the deadline. Donations rolled in from more than 8,500 donors from all 50 states and around the world.\n\n\nAlder Creek is an island of private property surrounded by Giant Sequoia National Monument, which spans about 328,000 acres (1,327 square km) and connects to the even larger Sequoia National Forest. The Rouch family has long used the grove for commercial logging, Hodder says, and even cut down giant sequoias in the early days, although since the 1960s they've reportedly only logged non-sequoia species like sugar pine and white fir. SRL plans to eventually transfer ownership to the U.S. Forest Service, so the sequoias can join the federally protected wilderness around them.\n\nThat won't happen for a while, though, since SRL expects to hold the property for five to 10 years. That's partly because this kind of public-acquisition process moves slowly, Hodder says, but also because SRL wants time to study the grove and implement a plan for good stewardship, making sure the trees are healthy and ready before handing them over to the public.\n\nAs part of that preparation, the group plans to open Alder Creek for public access even before giving it to the Forest Service, hoping to help the ecosystem ease into an unfamiliar role as a host for human visitors. \"This property has been in private ownership, and it has never had public access,\" Hodder says. \"We want to go through a thoughtful process to plan out public access, so when it does get conveyed into the national monument, it's ready for its public purpose.\"\" - article excerpt",

For those of you who have never seen a Sequoia in your life, please make the effort to do so (and donate if you can to their conservation), these behemoths are absolutely gorgeous and they make you feel so small yet so happy to see such beauty.\nI wish the previous owners would have just donated the land, but the fact that this group was able to raise money from so much support is awesome! I wish I would have known about this effort before, I would have helped...now I'm going to donate to help as much as I can!\n\nEdit: as mentioned in a comment below, I didn't talk about the smell: it's fresh and pure, a smell that makes you feel so immersed under these giants!",

Plus USFS tends to more actively manage forest habitat, which in many ways tends to ameliorate wildfire severity. NPS has been pretty good about implementing relatively robust prescribed fire programs (at least by western standards), so that's good at least. \n\nSequoia groves of this type often also need some level of active management to reduce other encroaching hardwoods and to maintain a healthy understory.

Tribes have been here about 10k years and colonial settlers since mid 1800\u2019s. Human led climate change is having an impact now (our climate is much warmer and dryer than even 20 years ago) but range shrinkage was just a case of the earths climate changing over thousands of years naturally. There is one other place in Japan that also grows a form of Sequoia, but I believe it is not the Sempervirens species which is known for its height and extreme old age. The warmer human led climate change is now posing a risk to the trees as we lose our infamous soupy fog that feeds the high needles on redwood branches and is drying the ground that feeds their roots. Sequoias have the shallowest root system of any tree despite their incredible height. They stay standing by interlocking roots with their community trees. Normally they have a nice muddy wet earth but as it dries, they lift their roots for water and then topple during winds storms, weakening and compromising all the trees around them. We get intense winds and many can blow down in one bad storm. It is very sad. We\u2019ll need a plan to save them long term. They have faced many foes but humans are the worst yet.",

There are Sequoiadendron giganteum, or giant sequoia, that live in the mountains, and Sequoia sempervirens or coast redwood. The fat ones and the tall ones, respectively. Though giant sequoias are pretty tall as trees go, they don't get as tall as the coast redwoods by a long shot.\n\nI don't know how either of them will do in the south, but I never recommend planting Sequoia sempervirens near a house. They have a tendency to fall down in high winds if not planted in a group. Happened to a friend of mine. Smashed the whole upper story of their house.",

In a high windstorm a lone Pine, even a bull pine, is at risk. As part of a larger group, all of them are safer.\n\nI wonder how many giants are needed to survive off of one another. Southern thunderstorms are no joke and those winds can get destructive fast. Thanks for the warning!",

The rising temperatures have impacted fog as well. The trouble is, they are an ecosystem in it of themselves. We live in a rainforest that is no longer raining enough. Ignoring this will cause a devastating chain reaction. It has already started but it will continue. We are seeing die off\u2019s of species as well as the rise of some dangerous new species like brain jelly fungus. Another example; our native people here whose cultures and health have depended on salmon, cannot fish as they need to for themselves, let alone market to the community. Their water sources are poisoned by unregulated marijuana growers and their streams have dried up or been diverted to grows, all of which is causing the trees and animals to die. Anyway, we have a serious people/climate impact problem here.",

The richest one percent gained more than a trillion dollars in wealth over the last decade, which is more than the estimated cost to counter the effects of global warming. But instead of using their massive wealth to save the world, they're just sitting on piles of gold like dragons.\n\nWealth inequality is so much worse than most people realize. Our current economic system is very broken and there's plenty of information that proves it. So, where to start?\n\n[The ultra-rich have as much as $32 trillion hidden away in offshore accounts to avoid taxes.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth-idUSBRE86L03U20120722) As a way to understand the magnitude of the number 32 trillion (32,000,000,000,000) let's use time as an example. One million seconds is only 12 days, but one billion seconds is 31 years. So there's a massive difference between a million and a billion, much more than people realize. But how much is 32 trillion seconds? It's over a million years.\n\nPeople know it's an issue but they don't understand just how extreme it can be. Here's an example: **If you had a job that paid you $2,000 an hour, and you worked full time (40 hours a week) with no vacations, and you somehow managed to save all of that money and not spend a single cent of it, you would still have to work more than 25,000 years until you had as much wealth as Jeff Bezos.** And yes [his wealth isn't all in cash, but he wouldn't want it to be.](https://np.reddit.com/r/MobilizedMinds/comments/dn8xdp/but_their_money_isnt_all_in_liquid_assets/)\n\nI've been researching this issue for years because I was shocked at just how bad it really is.

By workers I mean all workers, and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level, I mean the wages of decent living.\"** - Franklin Delano Roosevelt speaking about the minimum wage (it was always meant to be a living wage)\n\n\u00b0\n\n&gt;**\"The cause of poverty is not that we're unable to satisfy the needs of the poor, it's that we're unable to satisfy the greed of the rich.\"** - Anonymous\n\n\u00b0\n\n&gt;**\"Anyone who believes in indefinite growth on a physically finite planet is either a lunatic or an economist.\"** - Kenneth Boulding\n\n\u00b0\n\n&gt;**\"A century ago scarcity had to be endured; now it must be enforced.\"** - Murray Bookchin\n\n\u00b0\n\n&gt;**\"Capitalism as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of evils. I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion.\"** - Albert Einstein\n\n\u00b0\n\n&gt;**\"If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.\"** - Stephen Hawking\n\n\u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022\n\n**So, what do we do?**\n\nI think the first step is spreading awareness and organizing people. Joining or creating local organizations is always good, and [unionizing is a great thing as well,](https://i.postimg.cc/N06BZt33/12731.jpg) and there are organizations like the IWW that can help you do that.\n\nBut honestly I think one of the best things we can focus on is to get behind [the only candidate who has been talking about these issues for decades.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=SYxZfksAyco) Although [the media is slandering him,](https://youtu.be/3ZhkKATtqtU) and [completely omitting him from their coverage,](https://imgur.com/a/VyNVA8D) he [actually has the most support,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/02/us/politics/2020-democratic-fundraising.html) and [especially amongst young people.](https://i.redd.it/ybarwig9v5u31.jpg)\n\nThe [other candidates](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/24/elizabeth-warren-not-progressive) just [don't stack up.](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/22/pete-buttigieg-just-shill-corporations-and-donor-class)\n\nThe public needs to get more involved in politics, and we need to demand that the system works for us, but I think it's important that we have a leader who actually cares about solving these problems because otherwise it's even more of an uphill battle. So register to vote as a democrat, vote for Bernie in the primaries, and get as many other people as you can to do the same. Subscribe to r/WayOfTheBern, r/OurPresident and r/SandersForPresident. And if you're willing and able to contribute money or time then please donate or volunteer for Bernie's campaign. An easy thing you can volunteer for is phonebanking, where you contact people and give them information. There are many things we can do to fix these problems, but the most important thing is to get the right person in the white house, and we have less than 100 days left now. This is not a drill, please get this information out there as much as you can and make sure that people know about these issues and know how to fix them. Thank you for your support, together we can do this!\n\n\u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022  \u2022\n\n**If anyone would like to copy this post,** [**here's a Pastebin link.**](https://pastebin.com/g7cPiEhz) **And if you'd like to see more information like this, check out r/MobilizedMinds**",

It drives innovation and allows us to specialize and, in a very convenient manner, exchange those specialized skills for all kinds of goods and services. In many ways, even poor people (of developed nations, at least) have a quality of life equal to kings and nobility of the past. I'm talking about things like meat, spices, music, movies, etc. \n\nBut like anything, you shouldn't take things to the extreme, which we absolutely have done. Capitalism needs strict regulation in order to be executed in a moral way. In a sane capitalist system, the government would have bought this land and taken care of the forest at the taxpayers expense (Or better yet, it would never have been private land in the first place). I would reach the maximum character limit before running out of examples of the fucked up consequences of unfettered capitalism. Corporations have an endless, insatiable thirst for profit, at all costs. Ethics are an afterthought at best, and human suffering and environmental damage is completely ignored unless there are regulations that will be more painful than the reduced profit from taking such things into account.",

The politicians are bought by private capital and eventually the interest of the government is not the interest of the people but instead serves the desires of the wealthy. We are seeing this problem in most western democracies, and it's only going to get worse. So how do you fix capitalism when capital owns the government? How do you prevent that from happening when they write the laws and control the politicians?\n\nWe fixate on the importance of democracy in our government but the second you start talking about democracy in the workplace - where our resources are turned into goods and services are rendered for all of us, where we spend most of our lives - the conversation gets dismissed.",

(Side fact: their cones will only open to drop seeds when exposed to fire, so they actually need it to reproduce). If the bark is damaged, fire can get inside and burn out large portions of the trunk. It's quite common in Sequoia groves to see huge trees hollowed out by fire, which makes a perfect little shelter. I've always wanted to sleep in one, maybe OP has.",

There are a few things this article and the discussion of it get wrong:\n\n- Save the Redwoods isn\u2019t buying the entire grove, just the majority of it. There are still some Sequoias on private lots.\n- The land Save the Redwoods is buying has been publicly accessible for a long time.\n- I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate to say that\u2014despite the name\u2014Save the Redwoods \u2018saved\u2019 Alder Grove. Certainly there were some things done under Rouch management that probably aren\u2019t best for the grove (e.g. you\u2019re able to get pretty close to the Sequoias, which I think is bad for their roots) but the grove was by no means endangered by private ownership. This article says that the Rouchs logged non-Sequoias until recently, which might be true, but if it is I think they certainly did it in very small volume. I\u2019m hoping that Save the Redwoods will improve the health of the grove, but I don\u2019t know if that will work out. I\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re thinking about building a visitor center and otherwise trying to get more tourists (i.e. donors) to come up to the grove, and more visitation would probably be bad.\n\nIf you have any questions, AMA.",

Smoking is already way down in Canada over the last century, so we\u2019re probably hitting a point of diminishing returns, but this seems like a low cost strategy that\u2019s worth a shot imo. If nothing else, the added cost will be passed onto smokers and make it even less affordable. Apologies to any smokers, but it is what it is.",

Like, you're trying to say you're the good guy, because you want to disincentivize a certain kind of behavior that we all know is bad for us.  But look how you folks want to go about it.\n\nOf course less people will smoke if you make it prohibitively expensive for people.  But you know what else will go up?  Fucking poverty.  There are plenty of people who will pay that ridiculous price for cigs, because it's one of the most addictive substances on Earth.  When I lived in Chicago, I would leave Cook County to buy my smokes and get like a $3 discount.  You know who couldn't do that?  People without cars.  \n\nPeople who smoke are overwhelmingly poor and working class.  I ended up smoking because I deployed to Iraq, and then took a contract in Iraq, spending two years there.  I was a HUMINT collector and contractor for the embassy in Baghdad.  I smoked because my subjects smoked, and it was a good way to get them to open up.  That was over a decade ago now.\n\nMy wife and I finally quit last year.  We wanted to quit sooner, but it's hard.  Life is stressful.  I smoked a pack of Newports a day.  That amounts to something like $4,250 a year where I live.  My wife smoked too.  We paid our share of taxes, that's for sure.  Not sure the alcoholics pay their fair share considering how much all their health issues cost the healthcare system, but whatever I guess.\n\nMy point isn't that more people should smoke.  It's that, if we as a society really believe nobody should smoke, then we should do the moral thing and outlaw it.  Straight up.  These tax hikes have such a disproportionate impact on low-income folks that it's a moral travesty in and of itself.",

The air force has fled, getting hit in their airfield. Kerch bridge is broken and the road bridge still not repaired. All they have is a land bridge, which is under threat of the Ukrainian offensive, and the rail bridge, which would be under very heavy scrutiny for attack. Ukraine is getting better weapon and equipment that improves their capacity to continue hitting Crimea. Before the escalation they weren't at full out war and Russia went on with the impression that Crimea was untouchable, that has been shattered several times. Now they don't even have a dam to fight over for a region that was rationing water. The cost of supplying water was already a major money sink, $23b over the first 5 years. Crimea is absolutely not in the same position as it was in 2021.",

They know the water will stop to Crimea either way.\n\nLikewise, if Ukraine retakes Crimea, they will not be able to easily open the canal to supply Crimea with water either so that also sabotages Ukraine further.\n\nIt's a good indicator that Russia is pessimistic not optimistic about their defense lines.",

Russia can't hold over the threat of \"we'll do X\" if they just do it. You could say it proves that Russia is *willing* to do similar actions in the future which could be used as a negotiating tactic, but this doesn't really make sense either because this particular disaster is already one of the biggest actions they can take short of going completely over the pale - ie. widespread use of chemical weapons, or nukes - now any threat they make to do worse is not going to seem as bad.\n\nWhat makes the most sense to me is that Russia did this primarily for military concerns. They knew (or at least believed) that Ukraine was going to launch a large-scale counteroffensive in the south, but since most of the Russian units are in the northeast, the Russian lines in the south are probably extremely undermanned right now. Blowing up the dam and creating an ecological disaster is their way of stalling any potential Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south. Even if it only buys them a few weeks' time, it's still better than imminent defeat.",

Russia isn't blowing some random dam in Ukraine, they're blowing up a dam that undermines one of their longest-held strategic objectives.\n\nThat's not something they're ever going to do if they didn't believe they were facing a danger even worse than sabotaging one of their oldest and dearest goals. That's a sign of someone hitting the last-ditch panic button, not the sign of a considered strategy of terrorism. If anything, this terrorizes the Russian side more since it's not the Ukrainian-controlled side of the river that's taken, or going to take the most damage, and this isn't going to threaten resources in Ukrainian-controlled territory the way it threatens it for Crimea.",

And Russia blew it early.\n\nIn a few weeks, the flood waters will retreat and the summer weather will dry the floodplains out. Russia will have to actually move units back there to defend that area. Even worse, what was previously the Kakhovka reservoir will empty out, become a river and (potentially) bridgeable. Russia will have to strengthen defences around that area too at the expense of other parts of the front line.",

Strike also means perhaps 100th birthday letters from her may still be in the mail, particularly if she pre-wrote them. \n\n I'm not from the UK, but it sounds like a lovely gesture that people look forward to there. Hopefully someone continues the tradition :)\n\nEdit 2:  Several have pointed out ways the commenter's grandma easily could have received the letter this morning despite the strike. I truly meant no disrespect to the commenter or their grandmother. If I find their comment again, I'll link it here.",

If he overreaches on his own significance it would be seen as an insult to Elizabeth, as though he wants his Cult of Personality up and running immediately so everyone forgets about her.\n\nHe's too old and is too well known already to get any of that momentum behind him. The wise thing to do is... well, live in Elizabeth's shadow, like Charles has already been doing his whole life. He just now needs to live in her shadow while pretending that he isn't.

Rest in Peace Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nOnce the death has been made public, Holyrood Palace, St Giles' Cathedral, and the Scottish Parliament will serve as the focal point of  gatherings, with a condolence book open to the public set up at the  latter location. Parliamentary business will be suspended immediately for at least six parliamentary days, in order to allow authorities to  prepare for the funeral.\n\nThe parliament will then prepare a motion of condolence within 72 hours of reconvening. The Queen's coffin will first lie in repose at Holyrood Palace, followed by a service of reception at St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh. Following this, the coffin would then be transported to Waverley station and then taken by the Royal Train to London if possible.\n\nOtherwise, the coffin would be taken by plane to London and welcomed by the prime minister and cabinet ministers.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation\\_London\\_Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_London_Bridge)",

Take your favorite short/handy unit of measurement, and measure out 40 of them.  40cm, 40 inches, whatever.  Each mark is one lifetime, and you're looking at all the lifetimes since then.  That's roughly how many human lifetimes since then, and it's not actually all that many.\n\nEven going back to the first pharoh of Egypt, 5000 years ago, is only 100cm of 1cm markings.",

It's less about China being a \"beacon of freedom\" (whatever that means lol) and more about there being additional choices and counter-balances of power.\n\nFor just one example of this, the additional choice of having Chinese loans was welcome for many periphery nations that were being exploited by World Bank and IMF loans that came with many strings attached to them (e.g. privatization and the forcing of natural resources to be sold to the US/EU through corporate contracts).\n\nThen there's also other (larger with body count) examples of American-led military interventions with a broad range of consequences. I get that some ppl you vehemently disagree with also make these points but it is just reality that the American-led world order of unipolarity has had far-reaching consequences (much of them less than good) for a lot of the world.",

China pretty much chose to give out those loans for several purposes.\n\n- Soft Power amongst the developing countries (This one I'll excuse since the IMF and US haven't exactly been favorable. Plus, every country would like to have more friends (Read: Owed Favors to))\n- They knew the borrowing countries couldn't pay them back, so this is a version of economic colonialism wherein they control strategic and key ports and points around the world (Eg: Sri Lanka. China absolutely knew that Sri Lanka wouldn't be able to pay off the loan. They approved it exactly because they wanted the port.\n- Belt and Road Initiative\n\nThe American hegemony isn't a perfect solution, and I'm not going to make any excuses for them. I'm not American, I don't approve of a lot of their actions (Afghanistan, The Israel x Palestine conflict, Iraq, etc).\n\nBut my country shares a border with China (India) and I can tell you that the Chinese encroachment is a very real threat. People just accepted Tibet, but we saw during the pandemic how Hong Kong was crushed and folded back into China. Now we have Taiwan. On Indian borders, they continuously creep and slowly encroach their claim on Indian territory, and nothing anyone says or does stops them.\n\nAnother item to note is that the Chinese will not stop at claiming. They absolutely will crush democratic government and ideas. My country isn't perfect. It has issues. We have a flawed democracy. But I do not want a single party system where the leader can defacto lay claim to the government for life.\n\nAnd then there's the mass surveillance thing, but eh, everyone is already doing that. China's just the best at it. Every other country will follow soon enough, one way or another.",

These were the people with hands-on skills that were super useful in a fight.\n\nI mean, we're talking about blacksmiths making weapons, carpenters building stuff like barricades or even siege machines, tailors patching up uniforms, and farmers keeping everyone fed. Their jobs weren't just about making a living, they were a key part of the game plan for the rebellion. They knew how to fix and make tools, and they kept everything running smoothly.\n\nNow, look at today. A lot of those skills aren't so common anymore because we rely so much on technology. It's something to think about when you're comparing old-school uprisings with the kind of stuff that could happen now.\n\nThis isn't just about praising the old rebels for being tough and resourceful, it's also about realizing the different set of challenges that rebels today would face.",

To this day, the US government and military maintains that only a small number of civilians were killed directly by coalition forces, but this is a blatant lie. \n\nThe Johns Hopkins team found that out of the nearly 650,000 excess Iraqi civilian deaths from 2003-2006, over **90%** of them were killed *directly* by U.S./Coalition forces. That means either by American bombs, bullets, shrapnel, shockwaves from explosions, etc. \n\nIt\u2019s one of the most sobering facts I\u2019ve ever learned. And the fact that our officials *still* lie about it infuriates me.",

With that dream fully dashed by the realities of France's size, they've transferred that idea onto Europe. But it's really hard to have a foreign policy independent of the US as a liberal democracy because all the liberal democracies have roughly the same foreign policy ideas, disagreeing almost entirely on small matters of priority.",

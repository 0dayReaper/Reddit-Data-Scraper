That said, there is still hope. The proportion of Iraqis who rate their lives positively enough to be considered \u201cthriving\u201d doubled between 2008 and 2022 (9% vs. 19%, respectively).\n\n&gt; Further, the 18% who rate their lives poorly enough to be considered \u201csuffering\u201d is now lower than in several neighboring countries in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\n&gt; As the security landscape has stabilized following years of conflict and civil war, the proportion of Iraqis who feel safe walking alone at night has risen steadily, hitting a record high (74%) in 2022.\n\n&gt; Despite the difficulties of widespread poverty and high unemployment, Iraqis\u2019 economic outlook is resilient. About two-thirds (68%) say they are satisfied with their standard of living, and their outlook is positive: More Iraqis think their living standards are getting better than getting worse (53% vs. 31%).\n\n\n\n\nhttps://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/472253/looking-back-iraq-life-better-today.aspx\n\n&gt; Today Iraq is enjoying its most stable period since 2003.

Israel's military capacity is one of the things that affords it the ability to act as rashly as it does.",

Iranian efforts have already led to the fact that Hezbollah in Lebanon can reasonably accurately overwhelm Israeli air defenses and target its infrastructure. \n\nThis would be a critical national security threat to Israel even if you say that nukes on Israel are impossible.\n\nThis is for example also why Israelis always cited the lack of restrictions on Iranian support to groups like Hezbollah as a fundamental reason why JCPOA was crappy.",

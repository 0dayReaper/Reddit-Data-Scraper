[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

With a fierce battle cry, he urged his men forward. Swords gleamed in the sunlight as shields clashed, the thunderous sound of war reverberating through the air. And then, something unexpected happened. As the Romans charged, their voices rose in unison, singing the familiar melody of \"Land Down Under\" by Men at Work. The enemy froze, bewildered by this peculiar sight. But Caesar's clever tactic had worked. Confusion turned into defeat as the Gauls were overrun, and the Romans emerged victorious, their victory anthem echoing through the battlefield.",

That is about 30-50 infantry.\n\nThe counteroffensive has about 60,000 infantry.\n\nI don't understand why you think that one convoy is an indication of where the entire counteroffensive force is.\n\nReports that I've read say that the bulk of the Ukrainian force is somewhere around Orkhiv, which would make sense as it puts it in an agile position, ready to attack towards Melitopol, Berdyansk or Mariupol depending on which direction seems the most favorable.",

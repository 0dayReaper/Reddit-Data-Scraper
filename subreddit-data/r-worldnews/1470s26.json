            "comment": "Russian here, let me give you some context.  \n\n\nPMCs like Wagner are not part of the regular army. Actually, they are not even legal in Russia, and being a mercenary is a criminal offense. And this year, Wagner has tried several times to pass the law that would legally define the activity of the PMCs. Ironically, these attempts to pass the law were rebuffed through the influence of the actual Ministry of Defense.\n\nThe thing is, Wagner and the Ministry of Defense hate each other. Initially, when the war started to go poorly and Putin blamed the MoD for this, he gave Prigozhin effectively full power and a ton of resources to win the war. However, despite the bold claims, recruiting prisoners, and so on, Wagner performed just as poorly as the regular army, but suffered much heavier losses. Seeing that, Putin stopped favouring Prigozhin and started to rely on the regular army and MoD.\n\nPrigozhin feels that he has been thrown under the bus - not only did Wagner suffer extremely heavy losses, but they stopped getting priority equipment, munitions, and manpower.  He still wants to be an independent player, and that is the reason for his rejecting the attempts to bring Wagner into the standard military chain of command.  \n\n\nThe strange thing is, the order signed by MoD - that would bring the PMCs into their structure - was only that, signed by MoD. IF they wanted, they could have probably passed it through the Duma and have Putin sign it, in which case Prigozhin wouldn't have a choice.  \n\n\nAnyway, TLDR: having multiple independent military organizations conducting a war is a total mess, as expected",

This information was confirmed by the founder of the military company himself, noting that \"the case was not pursued\u201d\n\n\"There was such an inspection. But as far as I know, the case was not pursued. As for mercenary activities, I invented it, I created it and I run the PMC \"Wagner\u201d.

Whats remarkable that they are such a wonderful and talented group of people from ballet, music and the arts to engineering, physics and space exploration, they reached all of their achievements while under the yolk of absolutely the worst leaders. The uncaring self serving czars, crazy paranoid Stalin, corrupt politburo of the Soviet Union and now the brown underwear stain that is Putin. They CAN NOT catch a break. I wish them well and hope they can someday put their resources to the benefit of all their citizens and join the world stage as proud vital people not the downtrodden souls they are now. \n\nBest of luck.

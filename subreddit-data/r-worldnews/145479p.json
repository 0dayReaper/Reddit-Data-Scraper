This is the part where most people start to experience the symptoms of altitude sickness, which sound horrendous: pounding headaches, difficulty sleeping, dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite, lack of coordination, and excessive coughing (at times severe enough to crack a rib).\n\nI\u2019ve heard it described as like running on a treadmill while breathing through a straw.",

The first oxygen-bottle free climb wasn't until 25 years later, and even today, almost everyone uses supplemental oxygen.\n\nMy understanding is that the biggest difficulties with Everest is the thin atmosphere, the weather, and the crowds leading to delays.  Other than that, the standard route is not an especially difficult climb, as far as mountains go.\n\nI'm not joking about the crowds either - they've lead to delays that have resulted in deaths.",

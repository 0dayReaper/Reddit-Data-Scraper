[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1.

But no, just because they incurred losses of some high profile systems like Leopard 2 and Bradley doesnt mean the offensive is doomed or failing. \n\nThese vehicles are tools. They are used to attack positions but more importantly keep its crew safe. The attacks seem make progress and as far as we've seen the vehicle's crews have largely survived. This means the tools are doing their jobs.",

We haven't seen the main force of this one yet - for all we reasonably know this is all a feint for a repeat of the Kharkiv attack last year.\n\nAlso I'd be super cautious on the time line for F16s: I'd subscribe Mike Kofman's thoughts on them - they're much more a medium term thing to transition the Ukrainian military onto western equipment and away from Soviet stuff. At the moment, beyond the promise of F16s, it's still being worked out _where_ they come from (probably Dutch and Norwegian stock), and exactly _what_ is being given.. There's massive variety in the various production blocks and in turn capabilities. \n\nOn top of that you've actually got to train not only the pilots but also the air crews - each plane will need a dozen hours servicing for each hour spent in the air. Additionally once you can fly one, that doesn't mean you can effectively run every kind of mission they might be expected to accomplish. \n\nTldr: if I see F16s in combat over Ukraine before the end of the year I'll be astonished, and even next summer I'd be surprised to see more than a few dozen. Much better short term to keep up ramping up the high quality man pads and focus on ammunition supply for the patriots.",

F-16s will mainly be used to help shoot down cruise missiles, knock out air defense systems and other types of ground radars, and maybe launch some long ranged munitions if possible. \n\nUkraine is under a bigger threat of air attacks and more air defense systems are more important for securing air space than fighters. Neither side is capable of taking the skies but should Ukraine loose too many air defense systems it would open up Russian planes/helicopters to more freely knock out Ukrainian assaults. For Ukraine to do the same they would need 400 or so F-16s and successfully shoot down hundreds of Russian planes while also successfully destroying dozens of air defense systems.\n\nThat isn't going to happen. Ukraine's use of F-16s will be limited and most strikes will need to be done with ground launched systems like HIMARS and those ground launched JDAM things that are being worked on.",

The record for a Liberty transport ship to be constructed was 4 days as part of a promotional competition, but even on average they were making them in around a month each.\n\nIn WW2 they built over 150 aircraft carriers - the Casablanca-class of smaller escort carriers had 50x ships built, and were towards the end of the war built in only a few months - for example the USS Salamaua was laid down on 4 Feb 44, launched 22 April 44 - 78 days, and commissioned on 26 May 44 - **112 days** from construction start to being in service. That's crazy - the ship and it's crew saw combat in 1944 around the Philippines.\n\nThe scale of WWII was different in so many ways - even the small conflict in Ukraine is showing how far military production has fallen; they are firing more artillery rounds in two days than is typically produced in a month, to the point where donating countries are pulling back on providing artillery shells because they are worried their own supplies might not be enough.",

You'd likely see a similar situation to Russia where car regulations get dropped and new war designs have stripped down features. I can't even imagine what would happen to the smartphone market. The devices are more important than most realize to our daily lives but they also use components that would be in very short supply. Cars at least can always go back half a century and go 0 electronics, you can't do that with smartphones.

Im glad they got those mine clearing tanks and IED resistant transports.\n\n This is not some movie where the good guys (UAF) can be in godlike mode. the battles ahead will take a toll on the ukrainians but lets hope they can kill more russians than before at a higher ratio.

They hit a mine, crew gets out because you can't repair treads under fire. The Russians blew up at least one abandoned Leopard 2A6 with a loitering munition. \n\nWith luck, you can recover the vehicle, repair it, and send it out quickly before the enemy destroys it. People who thought western vehicles were impervious to landmines are in for a reality check.\n\nI think the main issue here is at least three Leopard mine rollers were destroyed. They had six. Loosing those would probably be a bigger loss than the tanks. The front is mined so heavily and will be the biggest hurdle for the initial assaults. Mine rollers and recovery vehicles are more important than people think.",

The US has literally thousands of them, and they are an infantry fighting vehicles not MBTs, even if they are absurdly good at killing MBTs. They are not built to be invincible heavy armor, the reason the US takes so few losses in this kind of offensive is exactly what you say, absolute dominance of the air and sea.\n\nBut this is Russia, they follow the \"Always claim victory, and if you can't claim you enemies cheated\" strategy. It is in the authoritarian playbook.",

There were a lot of Ukrainians, Georgians, Belarussians, Kazaks, etc in the Red army. The famous picture of the Soviet soldiers raising their flag over the Reichstag was actually a reinactment, since the first soldier who did so (a Kazakh soldier) did it at night when it was too dark for pictures. The actual photo was taken by a (Ukrainian) naval photographer, and the soldiers in the photo were Russian, Dagestani, and Georgian.",

Drone footage is becoming very common and at the moment the main issue oryx has is actually identifying (down to individual variants) what is lost. These high profile bradley/leopard losses will be more well documented as Russia ensures as much footage is taken as poasible, plastering it in their media",

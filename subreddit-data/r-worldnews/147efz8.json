[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.",

For the vast majority of local troublemakers it's easier to force them to emigrate or to deport them to Siberia. That has been the case under the Czars, Stalin and now Putin. Just look at how many Russian liberal politicians and critical journalists had to move to countries like Georgia because they received increasingly direct threats by state security at home.

He thinks that while he'd get asylum for telling the truth about Russian military attitudes, he'll get better conditions/more support/more protection for telling people what they want to hear.\n\n3.

We shouldn't accept from any other military either. If he wants to avoid criminalising himself (again a point , this is exactly what he himself justifies the decision under) under international law for war crimes, his only option is to not follow orders. Staying in Russia that means jail or worse. So the only option is to leave Russia.\n\nNot the only one. Here in Finland few people have done similar hike through the forest to avoid military call up, again aince they don't want to be part in what they have concluded to be illegal war of aggression.\n\nWe shouldn't turn these people away, each border jumping deserter is one less person available for Russian forces pool. Specially officers and other trained people. Normal call ups they can replace with more, badly motivated, call ups. Trained officers take training time and not as easily replaced.\n\nHe is neither some superhero or traitor. He is normal human being trying to do what he deems right to his best ability.",

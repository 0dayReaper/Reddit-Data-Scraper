                    "comment": "Years ago I used to work for a publisher. The academic arm had an explicit policy of revising textbooks every few years specifically to kill the used book market. They tracked stats like class size vs book sales per school. When that started to dip it was time to come out with a \"new\" edition.\n\nThey were very excited about ebooks coming. Textbooks are very expensive to print: they have to be on high quality paper, the typesetting is often very complex, and they're printed in very low volume compared to mass market books. They're basically the most expensive books to print.\n\nEven charging exactly the same for ebooks as print books results in large jumps in profit because your variable costs are next to nothing. Plus you don't take a hit on returns of unsold copies of the old books when the new ones come out. There's no such thing as an unsold ebook. \n\nAND there's no such thing as a used ebook, so students are forced to buy fresh copies for every class. \n\n**EDIT:** *I'm getting a lot of comments about PDFs. I get it, those can be shared. What my company was talking about back then was using DRM to tie each book to your student ID. If you screenscraped it and shared it, it could be tracked to you.*\n\nIn some schools that don't explicitly prohibit it, ebooks can also set up a massive conflict of interest for the professors. A prof might not be able to get his own textbook printed for his students, but he can absolutely afford to create his own ebook. Now he has a financial incentive to price it high and require that all students buy it.",

He deems them friends.\n\nBut between me and him i doubt his friends are trying to publish a new edition every year, it's the publisher. We know this already, and so we sail the seas",

Imagine each of your classes required a &lt;$50 summarized version that the prof has chosen the needed material from?

Tried selling them as a bundle, offered less than $300 for everything...like come on more than one book is worth that...but they have also been using more of a fun thing in courses where you have to buy their extra program that\u2019s basically just a discussion board that gives you a \u201ccuriosity score\u201d as a grade. Don\u2019t worry you will use a completely different platform between allllll classes and each will suck ass lol. \n\nThanks for letting me rant have a good day",

NOT THE FOURTH EDITION. FIFTH EDITION. \n\nAll of that is in caps because she practically screeched those words verbatim, on the first day of class. She even made the class repeat it before she moved on.. The experience is burned into my memory. Turns out, we barely ever read from it at all, and the chapters we did read were almost always the same regardless of edition.\n\nCare to guess who wrote that textbook?",

His professionalism was definitely questionable but he waived a couple redundant classes for me and did find a valid loophole for me to change majors/transfer without losing credits...so that was incredibly helpful.

My University gave us some bullshit about not being able to use older versions of textbooks (which would only be missing 1 or 2 case studies and were LITERALLY off by 10 or so pages from current textbooks) - because \"if the accreditation agency sees old textbooks we could be in violation\".\n\nEven at 19 with my non-fully developed dude-brain I realized it was bullshit at best. After spending $350 one semester on textbooks and getting $65 back at the end of the term, I never bought another textbook from the bookstore again.\n\nThis was thankfully when www.half.com was still a thing.",

The quizzes made up the biggest portion of our grade, so we had to buy the book to pass. And since the access code was the only valuable part of the package, that $200 book (plus separate binder) had a $0 resale value. \n\nIt felt like a scam, probably because it was a scam.",

And yeah, duckduckgo is your friend! I like to search by ISBN. One class, the textbook was selling for something like $150, and while DDG didn't get me *exactly* what I was looking for, I did manage to find a $30 ebook which was still much kinder to my wallet. Where it's unavoidable to pay full price for a digital subscription to a textbook, I went 50/50 with a classmate and shared a login. \n\nNow, when you need that code to submit an assignment is where I get really pissed off.",

This is fair. \n\n I want to state publicly I adore libraries and fully support them.  I am speaking specifically to charges involved in being able to go into the library on campus to use it to study. \n\nAlso I want to say to some of you that talk about databases and online materials through the campus library. I still have friends in college that are being charged for library use fees ( physical usage) and technology fees where the tech fees are for campus database search and online library (ebook) fees.

It's $40 to rent your cap and gown for the few hours it takes to do the ceremony (you can't participate if you don' have it) and then $5 per day for late returns. $60 per ticket for anyone to attend your ceremony, $20 for parking. $10 to process your final transcript and $10 every time you need it printed. You pay a $10 \"grad class fee\" every semester of your graduation year just for being a member of the grad class, even though you have to pay to attend any grad events. Then, finally, you pay between $60 - $300 to get your diploma depending on whether you want it in a frame. But the framing services are free! [Run by unpaid student volunteers.]",

If more and more teachers take the P**rson way out, they won't want to go back and put in a little more work to save their students loads of money/give them a better learning experience. Same goes for adjunct professors who are juggling 6 classes at 4 colleges, don't know if they are teaching the same class next semester and are getting paid 3k per unit.",

If you can't afford good post secondary education, you can't really get ahead (with few exceptions) There are scholarships here and there but not enough for everyone who meets the criteria, by a long shot. \n\nBeyond that, most of these places are just turning into degree mills anyway, pumping out piles of students who aren't any more qualified than they were before, into markets that just don't have enough jobs for them all, requring you to find even more money for even more expensive higher education to get more qualifications, which by the time you get them, so do a bunc hof others, and there still aren't enough jobs, unless you like kids with doctorates flipping burgers... \n\nProfiteering at every level including the school itself, the textbook publishers, the amenity providers, the vending machine contracts, odd deals with local transit that basically gets everyone paying for services that not everyone needs... it's all a big mess\n\n\nedit: oh and once you're done with all that and paid off, you can enjoy the alumni association hounding you for the rest of your life with their hands out for more money",

The only difference? The CC Prof gave us the book in pdf for free if we read his syllabus all the way. \n\nUW's choice of book? Fucking Cengage and their access codes. I have to pay to do homework. Usually if you need a code, you're going to be doing homework on that platform. Access codes are a scam and promotes lazy grading and cut/paste classroom formats. Every single class I've taken that used Cengage or Pearson (mostly Math), the grading style was exactly the same, do the homework that is available on the website.\n\n(NEWSFLASH: This promotes cheating since everyone knows what google search does)\n\nThese homework assignments were always due the morning of class or the following night usually ranging 20 to 40 problems. The few classes that didn't use an access code had the most active professors I've ever had. My Diff EQ class was the best and hardest time of my life because the professor made our homework and tests from scratch but also made sure the topic was understood.\n\ntldr: Fuck Access Codes.\n\nEdit: I almost forgot. Fuck Cengage too!",

I personally like HTML: A Complete Reference, but The Definitive Guide to HTML and HTML: A Visual QuickStart Guide are good too. I told the bookstore to stock A Complete Reference if you want to drop by. You can try w3schools.com but you'll get annoyed pretty quickly not being able to highlight, flip, and index. Anyway assignments are on your student portal, the print shop will get you a paper copy for $10 if you want.\"",

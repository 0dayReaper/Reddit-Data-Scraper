Brazil is a conservative and religious country plagued by problems, lack of jobs in my area is one of them . If you paid the plane ticket , I would happily leave to NK tomorrow .\n\nAbout juche being a utopia , the ideals in juche are the reason that NK still exists at all,despite the aggression it suffers with sanctions ,lies , hired defectors etc. And they are doing very well in fact , I see in not western centric media news almost every day about the development of a new huge farm , a new housing complex , a new weapon (which is the key ideal of juche that keeps the US at bay ), if not for the sanctions and the US determinatiom to exterminate at all costs any society that doesn't bow to the United Stadian imperialist global regime , they would surely be much more open and have a lot less material needs ,which I say ,they have a lot of problems with that . That was said to me by a government official in Hwangju , and by a professor with a lot of experience with sanctions since he is cuban , in a class literally named Economy Of Countries Under Sanctions.",

Even in the countryside people get food delivered by the government in a regular basis , so much that the locals wouldn't hesitate to make a banquet in every house I had dinner, happily offered to me without me even asking for it. There's a lot of hardships in North Korea , but they're all due to the sanctions imposed to them because not being capitalist is a no no for the US.",

I would sure live in the US if it really followed the liberal ideas that are dominant in political science , as it did before the conservative turn it had probably since the Reagan administration. Your country has no  political parties different in the political spectrum. Only TWO parties , both with right ideals (sorry but a leftist government would never bomb a country regularly as Obama did.)

Combine all this to the fact that I am from a lower middle class family , and that when they do a background check on me they will see that I was affiliated to two socialist parties , do you think it's feasible for me to go? In my undergraduate thesis I wrote a lot about the US , so be surte that I have in fact a pretty good idea about the bad times yall have been through.",

By not calling you Americans , but estadunidenses in Portuguese and Spanish for example , we're fighting against the idea that us is America .America is a single continent , and so we're also americans. Imagine if China imposed the notion that they're called Asians instead of Chinese, that's a big fuck you to all the other States in the continent, and I'm sure people here would call it dictatorial , oppressive ...\n\nAlso , the more latinoamerica engaged people always use maps with the south on the top , since the north being on top is only a choice to make Northern countries look bigger and to be more the focus of the the lookers' eyes .",

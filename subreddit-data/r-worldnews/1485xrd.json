[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Ukraine's rolling up what's effectively the warning systems. The concern is the defenses Russia had been preparing ~15-20 km to the south.\n\n(2) is important since if Ukraine is able to breach *those* defensive lines, they have a high likelihood of being able to reach Mariupol, which allows them to cut off the Kherson front/Crimea.",

So you claim that practically the whole of Novorossiya has already been liberated and this allows you to start saying that the declared goals of the Special Military Operation are successfully fulfilled and therefore we can talk about the completion of the Special Military Operation?\n\n&gt; Mr. President! Take a look in encyclopedic dictionaries and read, what is Novorossiya? Let me remind you that Novorossia includes the territory of present-day Ukraine from Kharkov to Odessa.\n\n&gt; Are the territory of Kharkov region and the city of Kharkov under our control?\n\n&gt; And have the city of Odessa and Odessa oblast already been liberated?\n\n&gt; And have the city of Mykolaiv and Mykolaiv Oblast already been incorporated into the Russian Federation?\n\n&gt; And what do your words \"a significant part of Donetsk\" mean? Isn't the former Donetsk Oblast part of the DNR? But SIXTEEN percent of its territory is still under the control of the AFU today. And we have not been able to dislodge the Ukrainian army from Marinka and Avdeevka, essentially the suburbs of Donetsk, from where the capital of Donbass is shelled every day for fifteen months. Have Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, as well as hundreds of other settlements in Donbas, already been liberated?\n\n&gt; I do not want to give you advice because it is obviously useless, but try to have a detailed map of military operations in Ukraine on your wall in your office, where all the changes in the course of military operations will be marked on a daily basis. Maybe then you won't embarrass yourself to the whole world by your ignorance of the situation at the front?\n\nIgor Girkin. It's always Igor Girkin.",

Economic collapse could, but it would need to see Putin fall first. A Versailles type deal isn't an option for him. Maybe no Russian strong man could. Which would mean all bets are off. And NATO has consistently been focusing four months to a year in the future for a while now. So this is the next logical step. Western jets and long range fires can enforce a poor man's DMZ. Russia needs to be forced to the table. Its a good opportunity to put China and Iran under economic pressure too.",

If there is no clear goal you're causing more tension with China, and getting nothing back in return. In the case of Iran people starve, and if you're lucky you might get some kind of nuclear deal. \n\nIt is not in the interest of China for Iran to have nukes, and China is the only country who's seems to have influence with Iran. If you really want to prevent Iran from gaining nukes, the only two options with a decent chance of success could be war, or a deal involving China.\n\nMore importantly now, China could provide a lot of support to Russia if they chose to do so. Maybe let this war finish before going all in on a new cold war. \nChina should understand how difficult an invasion of Taiwan would be, but we should definitely be concerned about this. However, we may be overlooking other places where China is more likely to use their military first, and who are not in a position to defend themselves as well as Taiwan.",

Zelensky was practically begging Putin to pick up the phone and talk meanwhile the US and other western countries were using every diplomatic lever to get Russia to negotiate. Macron personally went to visit Putin in an attempt at negotiation.\n\nEvery single attempt at negotiations failed. The ONLY reason Russia wants to negotiate now is so that they can stop the Ukrainian advance, manufacture more weapons, train more troops and then start the war at a later date ideally when Trump is president. If Russia was genuine about wanting peace they would pull back to the original 1991 lines, return the kidnapped Ukrainian children and negotiate in good faith. The fact that Russia refuses to do this means the only \"peace\" they find acceptable is unconditional Ukrainian surrender.",

If we take, for example, one of the missiles that hit Kryvyi Rih today, about 50 components in it - mostly microelectronics - were produced in other countries.\n\nToday, representatives of our state met with diplomats from the respective countries. All partners have a list of companies that supply \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa with components for murder. Everyone in the world also understands how terrorists are trying to deceive the world. And we are waiting for conclusions and swift action to stop missile terror.\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 has imposed sanctions on all companies in \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa that produce missiles. Such complete sanctions should be imposed globally against all of them. Every way of circumventing sanctions should be appropriately punished at the global level as well. If someone acts as an intermediary or works together with \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa so that terrorists can continue to blow up residential buildings and kill people, such entities - whether business or government - deserve a response from the world. A tough response. Our partners have all the information on this.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1668728018175418369?cxt=HHwWgoCz4dHSwaguAAAA",

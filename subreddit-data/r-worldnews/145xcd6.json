I'd associate Japan more with earthquakes and then yes, the very occasional Tsunami. Dealing with water and rebuilding infrastructure to avert the same disaster again is the foundation of Dutch society.",

Dutch firms are also responsible for much of the Dubai islands construction. In addition, their polder system is world class. The only recent blunder has been Katrina where the Dutch firm basically had the city sign off on the fact that it didn't meet the standards the Dutch firms wanted as they were worried about flooding (go figure) in stronger storms. The city didn't care because it was cheaper and they didn't want to account for \"rare\" stronger storms. \n\nThe Dutch also have an entire country basically living at or below 100 meters from sea level with most of the land being at or below sea level.",

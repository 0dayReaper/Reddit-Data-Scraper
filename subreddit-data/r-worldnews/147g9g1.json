People were rightfully shocked because of the demeaning depiction of Congolese, Rwandese and Burundese.\nThey completely overhauled the museum with lots of context, contemporary Congolese art, societal explanations etc.\nThe most racist statues were put in a less prominent position, with explanation.\n\nNow people are complaining that those statues are being hidden.\n\nThere's literally no way to solve this issue to everyone's satisfaction.\n\nPersonally I think they should have kept it as it was, it was brutally clear: museum of colonial propaganda.",

Making the encounter contextless. In addition, the map of the main slave markets in Africa omitted Algiers and Cairo. That's just wrong.\n\nLastly, I know it's a complex question but the war against the arabo-swahili slavers was justified as a fight against slavery. They used that in the propaganda but the catch is that they replaced it with generalised forced labour and of course the obligatory proof to justify each bullet fired and the \"necessary\" actions to coerce the locals. As you needed proof for each bullet shot it was quicker to chop a hand instead. A consequence nobody saw coming apparently.",

There was no census data, impossible to know how many died due to violence. There was also an epidemic disease, which killed thousands. There was massive forced labour on impossible projects that probably killed most. This is of course tightly connected with colonialism and white supremacy, but it does complicate things. Note that Belgians had zero say over this as there wasn't even a general right to vote, most were illiterate and worked in the mines, factories or on the land. \n\nL2 \"gifted\" the freestate to Belgium after the international outcry. He was also just out of money and Congo was badly run also financially. There was a parliamentary investigation and recommendations were made to end the worst atrocities.\n\n- when Congo became a Belgian dominion, things improved. There was less killing and straight up slavery, but colonial rule was very harsh. There were whippings, large scale abuse of women etc. It is also different because people from all layers of Belgian society traveled to the Congo. There was a reasonable understanding of the situation and Belgians were much more educated and had a democratic say in things after WW1.\nThen came the independence, a charismatic leader arose in Patrice Lumumba and the Belgian government couldn't have that, he was a bit red too. They shipped him off to the eastern provinces with the help of the CIA and he was murdered.\nMubutu was put in place and Belgium reduced it's influence.\nThe partition into Congo, Rwanda and Burundi would however never be stable and colonial policies led directly to the Rwanda genocide. Belgium had officially extended apologies for its role, but no reparations.\nA similar, but less clear gesture was made to Congo last year, however Congo remains one of the worst places to live in the world.\n\nSo yes it's much more complicated than the Nazi's as different people, states, companies and politicians were involved at different times and different levels.",

It continued on plenty when the independence movement happened. Belgium did some fucked up things there where they told the Congolese people they could be independent but had no rights to the material wealth Belgium had already claimed for itself. They could govern themselves, but had no resources to do so. Belgium set them up to fail deliberately.\n\nThere are definitely still some people alive today who were responsible for that. But I don't think they should necessarily be put on some sort of trial. Be it judicial or public opinion.\n\nThere are however plenty of companies like Umicore and ArcelorMittal, but also many others, that used these rules to siphon wealth outside of Congo. They had laid (illegitimate) claim to resource rich land in Congo during the colonization and kept it when Congo became independent. If you say that you don't believe those companies should give back the land they were only able to claim because of colonization, you are essentially saying you believe colonization was legitimate.",

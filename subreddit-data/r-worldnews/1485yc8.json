[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The situation in India is far more nuanced than 'Hindutva'\nThat is mostly an internal issue, issues with China far predate modi and the current iteration of the BJP.

Tensions are not new, nor are they result of modis attempt to use Hinduism as focus for nationalist sentiment (something that is honestly doomed to failure because of how Hinduism is actually structured). Tensions would have heated up regardless of who was in the PMs seat in India",

You know those around you in concentric circles, or by trade corridors. \n\nThe United States is a large country, and it\u2019s easy for folks to forget how easy it is for average American citizens to live their lives without needing to deal with other nations (not people _from_ other nations, mind you). \n\nAs for leaving other nations to their own border politics. It is appropriate for the US to avoid interventions in foreign military affairs; the last two decades of war have harmed the average citizen\u2019s wealth and security while enriching corporate interests at the taxpayer\u2019s expense. Maybe there are features of the global currency, debt, energy, and trade architecture that \u201cjustify\u201d the level of military involvement requires to maintain empire, but honestly, there comes a point where the returns begin shrinking while the cost of policing rises. We\u2019ve passed that point. \n\nThe 21st century is going to be different from past eras through insofar as there are so many technological possibilities; mid-century demographics are unpredictable; and while there are some very great problems on the horizon, there are solutions that people today just are unwilling to entertain, and threats we have a hard time practically understanding.",

China has nearly eliminated extreme poverty, whereas nearly half of the population were in that group in the 80s.\n\nYour mistake is naively believing that just and humane governments yield economic success. Yes, China has been brutal and totalitarian since Mao Zedong took power, and he himself was insanely stupid and caused more than one famine, and yet even despite that stupidity he managed to industrialize a mostly agrarian society.\n\nMany would argue it\u2019s totalitarian governments that can make changes so fast, even if it\u2019s sloppy or causes the deaths of 10s of millions.\n\nYet my original point is your comment about older Chinese \u201cgoing down the same path.\u201d What they want is the rapid improvement of China without the sloppy, idiotic mistakes that kill millions. Sure, from Western perspectives we view the style of government with the resulting tragedies, but that\u2019s simply not how the CCP views it.",

You know, if you have a more modern type of job or profession, you are pretty aware of it and it's just something they don't talk about because obviously the gov ain't about that.\n\nHowever they do say that more poor folks who have to do more labourous work each day don't really know about it, but they also don't really have time for any amounts of politics or history or anything like that, just trying to survive like everyone else.\n\nAnyway, so I just wanted to mention it because it gave me a bit of hope I guess to hear that they feel a lot more people are aware than maybe we are led on to believe.",

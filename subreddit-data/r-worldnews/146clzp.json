But finding specific source is a bit difficult now, Google is not giving me anything good besides latest and largest news :(\n\nEDIT\n\nAha, found it!\n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/1/3/is-russia-really-africas-friend\n\nDude from Zambia was studying Nuclear Physics in Russia, was convicted of having drugs, got imprisoned and then 2 years later dies in Ukraine.\n\n&gt; But Nyirenda\u2019s family has insisted on an investigation into his recruitment, suspecting he may have been coerced. They also say he was wrongfully convicted; he had been working as a courier to support himself while studying in Moscow but was stopped and searched by the police, who found a package he was carrying with drugs in it.",

It\u2019s easy to dismiss anything Russia says as being a lie, but the fact that he\u2019s a nobody makes me feel that he\u2019s just some rando that played stupid games. \n\nI lived in Russia for 7 years and the mephadrone dealing subculture in Russia is huge and really easy to find your way into. Everyone knows someone that does meph, and it\u2019s pretty commonly talked about. You can\u2019t walk a single block without seeing these homemade ads posted on lamp posts advertising big profits per day for \u201ccourier\u201d services. People reach out and become \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0438 (people who leave drug dead drops), and often times these are school age kids, so that part of the accusation also doesn\u2019t shock me in the slightest. Whether you reach out through that or, more likely, are just doing meph with someone who gets you into the business, it can seem like a well oiled machine, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some of the more successful dealers have cops on their payroll as well. \n\nFrom my experience there, what happened to this guy doesn\u2019t seem that far fetched. I could easily say that I could have, if I had been dumb enough and into that crap, probably been 2 calls/people away from getting myself situated in the same position as him. \n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes, but to me, this doesn\u2019t smell like a political playing chip, just some American who made some dumb choices from readily available illegal opportunities.",

And British, Ukrainians etc. And they aren't being arrested unless, you know, they break the law. The laws which are still in place, and being policed, despite the country being at war. But it has to be some conspiracy BECAUSE it's a US citizen. \n\nI don't know about most uncultured, I know a fair few cultured Americans (related to quite a lot). But I do think that the idea that the US is the most democratic and free nation is wrong. Get back to us when censorship isn't a thing and women's rights aren't being annihilated. \n\nIt's sad, though, because my US family that now live here, realise how totally untrue the whole America exceptionalism thing is. Now they have realised that there is literally nothing exceptional, they feel a bit cheated. C'est la vie.\n\nEdit: get yourself over to the UK or somewhere else in Europe. You sound like one of us. Come on over!",

Minecraft.  They don't specifically outlaw being LGBT, but their anti LGBT propoganda law is so vague that it doesn't take but a whisper and you're gone off to jail.  So, you can't really trust any charges coming from Russia right now. At least in the US the charges  usually fit the crime.",

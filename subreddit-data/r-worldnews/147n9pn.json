[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Everyone in Spain knows this place as Valley of the fallen (valle de los ca\u00eddos).\n\nIt's a mass grave (about 35.000) and church named by the dictator Franco to \"honor the deaths of the civil war\". In reality it was a symbol of the dictatorship and repression built by political prisoners. Almost nobody visits it unless they like to hold their arm at a 45\u00ba degree angle.\n\nNow 80 years later the government wants to make the place a memorial again. That's the reason for the renaming and other things like taking out the dictator from his tomb in the great hall.",

My professor was telling us the history of the tomb of Dictator Franco (which lies deep within the mountain under that cross) in my native tongue giving us the real details of the atrocities that happened, but would switch to Spanish and be much nicer about the history when security would come by. \n\nFresh flowers were present on Franco\u2019s grave\n\nThe locals would describe it as similar to having a memorial for Hitler",

A dictator burying himself over thousands of men he defeated and killed, all under a grotesque cathedral he built with slave labor. The last dishonor. It's nightmarish. I feel so awful for the republicans buried there and their families. I'm glad the Spanish government are taking action now.",

They are excited and genuinely believe that he national would head to a better future.\n\nAfter the incident, all hope was lost. I haven't seen Chinese people (well, with the exception of Hong Kong) looking as empowered and hopeful in the recent years.",

If you ask any high level a Chinese official now, I would guess at least 50 percent chance they were a student protestor in 89\n\nThey were co-opted through carrots and sticks but honestly Deng (the mastermind behind Tiananmen) was brilliant strategically afterwards.  These protests happened at the cusps of the country fighting with itself on deciding whether to continue the communist system.  Deng shortly after this threw open the economy but kept political control.  Essentially he give the protestors half of what they wanted after the crackdown.  China\u2019s rise and current power is sourced from this decision.  These protestors all got fucking rich and essentially this young generation of Chinese built the current superpower that is challenging the US and are now in charge of China.  For the most part, they became part of the system.",

Those protests were nationwide and lasted for months, in dozens of cities.  It was barely 30 years ago, the biggest political upheaval in a generation, tens of millions participated.  And the generations of early 20s protesters then are the same generation ruling the country now (the next president will be of this generation).  \n\nAlso, don\u2019t know why ppl compare it to the 2019 Hong Kong protests.  The direct implications the former, even though unsuccessful, dwarf those of the latter.  So long as the govt made sure there was no sympathy among its 1.4bil, it became no more than a nuisance.\n\nE: also, it wasn\u2019t your normal protest where ppl went home.  These students camped out there for months on end and engaged in many hunger strikes",

They'd cut off your two primary digits (pointer and middle finger) leaving you with a pinky and ring finger. It's impossible to swing a sword with only those two fingers. They'd do this to hundreds of POWs and then send them home. They can no longer effectively fight, and they've still got to be fed and watered, so they become a burden to whichever kingdom they belonged to.",

They were a nuisance because you couldn't really do anything about them, so they punished them like that making them ineffective as well, since those fingers are what are used to hold an arrow.\n\nThis is why the \"peace\" symbol (but backwards) is an insult in most European nations. It's showing your opponent that you still have your fingers so can shoot them with a bow.\n\nI suppose all of this would still agree with what you stated, but it's weird that I heard it specifically about archers if what you said is true. Idk. I'd like to see a source if anyone knows one.",

If they're heavy, most people do NOT use their pinky, using their other fingers only, but DO flex the pinky to use the shared muscles.\n\nYou're right the pinky/ring contribute to grip strength, but removing the pinky is different to restricting the pinky.\n\nSource: PhD in Robotic Manipulation",

It'll even affect a pistol grip, though not as much. \n\nOf course In the modern world it's not a big deal because we don't generally use physical force to settle our differences so it's even more symbolic nowadays.",

I cannot even imagine living in a democracy that becomes a dictatorship. I felt a bit of that these last 3 years with trump, but I feel that my confidence in our system will eventually get him out.. so I do feel hope that change is possible. I dont know how many HKers will feel knowing there is no hope for change. They must leave or be subject to dictatorship. Fuck.",

If you get the chance, I can't recommend a secluded vacation in the Alabama nature enough, or a small getaway to one of our 5-ish wonderful cities. \n\nI promise, it's not as bad as it once was, and its getting better everyday. Also, as an aside, while it is full of about 100,000 screaming rednecks, if you've never been to the race in Talladega, you're missing out. Don't bother with the actual event because...

The US prison population could simultaneously populate about 50 countries all by itself - every small country up to Malta or Iceland, depending on how you count things. If a country like Sweden was to achieve a comparable absolute prison population while maintaining its current incarceration rate, it would need to expand to having 6 billion total citizens.\n\nIt has a long way to go wrt *this* particular protest being worse than *that* particular protest, but when around 10% of Americans end up in prison over the course of their lifetime, you don't get to win any prizes for not doing *even more*. By the way, if you're a black male without a diploma, that rate goes up to 60%.\n\nArguably, the US just arrested most of their potential protestors before they could join the protest.",

            "comment": "The protestors of Tiananmen were NOT protesting communism, they were protesting the Chinese billionaires who were overworking employees like \u201ccapitalist lords.\u201d In Chinese culture, the students carry more power than even elected officials, although not by much. The reason is because students represent the future of China. The Tiananmen protests started with students that were demanding things similar to Mao, which basically consisted of ending billionaires. The communist party sent the military in to stop them BEFORE the civilians rallied behind them, because it would have threatened the billionaires and modern Chinese attempt at socialism with chinese characteristics vs the Mao approach to socialism. Tiananmen was about a correction to the modern Chinese take on communism, not a protests against communism itself. The west did not understand this and actually made really bad policies about this until they realized that Tiananmen had nothing to do with capitalism at all.\n\nEdit because some uninformed person decided to contradict me. Read the link and scroll to case study 1: Tiananmen square. This is a published report, and is open to the public to view. I stumbled across this report by accident when doing research on Chinese politics. However, there is a plethora of information on this topic. I advise utilizing quality data, instead of propaganda from news reports.\n\n\nhttps://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/analytic-culture-in-the-u-s-intelligence-community/analytic_culture_report.pdf",

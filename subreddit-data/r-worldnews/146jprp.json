            "comment": "There's a lot of misunderstanding or misinterpretation in this thread\n\nAsylum seekers in Japan are typically detained at airports on arrival. They're not necessarily illegal immigrants - most of them arrive with the correct travel documentation.\n\nOnce detained they're put into immigration detention centers for 12-18 months at a time while their case is \"reviewed\". As others have mentioned, &gt;98% are rejected. \n\nOnce rejected, most detainees apply for asylum again, and this process continues perpetually. The Geneva convention prohibits deportation of individuals with an asylum application in progress. Some people stay in detention for years. Other people die. Occasionally the immigration authority would try to deport people at the moment their asylum application was denied. This led to a number of deportation related fatalities. AFAIK this practice was curbed but not stopped.\n\nAfter about 14 months of being detained, some (most?) detainees become eligible for provisional release from detention on their own recognizance. They can be detained again at any time. But once they've been released, they're able to function in Japan more or less legally. Depending on their circumstances on release, they may become legal residents of Japan. This is why most of them refuse to leave, and why some of them kill themselves rather than be deported.\n\nIt's grim.",

You hear about it more these days because El Nino makes the effects of climate change worse and we consume more news than ever before.\n\nFull answer below.\n\nEl Nino and La Nina are two sides of a weather cycle, so we are always in one or the other (barring a brief transition period between the two).\n\nLa Nina (the cooler part of the cycle) is considered the \"default\" as it lasts longer, usually for periods of 4-6 years. El Nino is usually 2-3 years, and the climate oscillates between the two.\n\nEl Nino in itself isn't bad; it's a natural post of the weather cycle. The problem is that it dials up the effects of climate change. \n\nCompared to a La Nina phase, during El Nino droughts are longer, heatwaves are hotter, and therefore things like wildfires are more intense. Now climate change has caused those types of (what used to be rare) events to be much more frequent and intense, we notice the even more increased intensity of them during El Nino much more.\n\nThe other part of the reason you hear more about it is also that news is broader, wiser reaching and more in your face than ever. 20 years ago whether we were in La Nina or El Nino would have been only known by climatologists, the general public wouldn't have heard about it. Now we consume news like it's oxygen, so we hear about more and more things.",

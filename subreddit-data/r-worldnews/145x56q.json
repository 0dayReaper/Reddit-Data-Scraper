Unless there's an eye-witness report from a non-combatant (something that should be pretty difficult to come across at the line of contact outside of cities), there's no way to verify.",

Bias can show even in the choices of what you decide to report or not, and not only that's what's going on here with Pravda, you'd expect it from them. They'll obviously focus on stuff Ukraine prefers to publish. They don't pretend to be neutral.\n\nBut a bad source would mean they tend to be wrong or lying, and that doesn't really seem to be an issue with them.",

The brain drain will continue, nothing left in Russia to take pride in, no desire to return. Compound that with the brain losses in the conflict itself. Russia is in the middle of  a \u201cHuston, we have a problem\u201d moment. I suspect this is by far the most serious problem Russia is facing, a future without the minds and the muscle of it\u2019s youth. \n\nUkraine on the other hand is in the middle of something that\u2019s bigger than one\u2019s self. That!\u2019s something that attracts and motivates young adults in particular. I don\u2019t see Ukraine suffering from either the loss of the brains or the muscle in the near future. \n\nPut it in simpler terms, the Ukrainian youth will have countless stories to tell of heroisms in the Great War. The poor Russian youth will recount stories on how they avoided the meat grinder. I know if I were 20 something what side I\u2019d want to be on and part of!",

To me, the current process just seems like a reversal of what the Russians did.\n\nI believe Ukraine is doing this right now because:\n\n1) Russia has only recently captured the city and has not set up adequate defenses.\n\n2) Wagner is rotating out and the replacements will not have the same level of experience in this area.\n\n3) With the activity in Belgorod and all across the southern front, Russia is not able to focus on Bakhmut.  And if Russia does decide to dedicate significant attention, then the southern front is softer. \n\nThus, it makes sense to attempt to take Bakhmut during the counter offensive while the enemy is disorganized  VS UA who had over a year to prepare defensive fortifications in this city.",

It's important to keep the Russian Army locked in this Area, so they can't easily reinforce the south against the main UA push. \n\nUkraine already did a pretty good job at shaping operations with Bakhmut and the Belgorod invasion, to force Russian reserves from the south to the East and North of Ukraine.",

Fox News was always much worse, but after fox lost viewers after the dominion thing, CNN changed gears to try to attract them, and they're now nearly as bad as fox.  every title I see relating to ukraine is closer to the russian propaganda version than other outlets.  ukraine said to keep quiet about their offensive for many reasons, and especially because losses kill morale among your troops for obvious reasons.  they're doing small attacks to test defenses before they start.  they said it will be very clear when their actual counter attack starts, but I keep seeing CNN (and obviously fox and the other right wing outlets) pandering to russian propaganda.  I mean the day they said they thwarted Ukraine's counter offensive and killed 1500 ukrainian soldiers and some silly numbers of vehicles, was the same day people realized the video of them \"killing a leopard tank\" was a damn John Deere combine.  they lie.  if your title is anywhere near russia's version, you're failing at journalism.  to give the benefit of the doubt to the country that has lied nonstop since last February, the country that's the invading force committing war crime after war crime while predominantly attacking civilians, it's just pure bullshit.  Ukraine says they haven't started yet.  so why the hell is CNN spreading russian propaganda?  fuck CNN",

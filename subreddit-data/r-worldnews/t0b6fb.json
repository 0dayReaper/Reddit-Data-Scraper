People who protest are considered \"being out of common sense\" and \"surrenderists\" or even worse by various media. It seems to repeat something along the Nazi propaganda lines.\nIt is hard to flee anywhere since I don't have international passport due to not serving yet.\nI love my country and I love most of the citizens. But seems like most of who don't want war now have the following thoughts: \"I can ruin anything for me and I'm ready. I can ruin everything for my child if my grandchildren are going to be in a better world. But who can assure me there won't be mad dictator along the lines of resistance who will take power vacuum after.\". It seems to be common thought since we have 2 examples of such shit happened within last century in just one country. Some people want to leave, but scared for their family and relatives staying in Russia. Most people know there most likely won't be a \"big war\", but things like this don't make anyone life better.\nI have friends from Ukraine and I don't know why they and any Ukrainian should suffer things like these. I have a lot of things to say, but I'm worry about wall of text that is here already. I never felt worse for being unable to do something of large scale.\n\nUpd.: Thanks for the silver, kind stranger.\n\nUpd.2: My own grandmother(though we are pretty distant now despite being closest relatives) sending me overly nationalistic videos through WhatsApp. I don't even know what to answer. Probably nothing. Her husband was officer, defending the USSR until his retirement. He died from lung cancer and heart disease combined with various other illnesses with nothing to leave after except the flat and Officer's pension. Now she is not poor on Russian pensioner standards, but it still definitely not enough to live OK. Her father died while freeing Europe from Nazi fighting from first days of the war(WW2) until almost the end of it. Idk why the hell am I even adding this as update, but it just made me totally uncomfortable.",

In the last parliament elections, only around 47% voted, and around 50% voted for United Russia party, which is basically Putin's party. \n\nSo, only around 23% of voters did vote for Putin and his policies, which include government associates of all levels, military, and other government-dependent people, who are often monitored by their bosses on how they voted. \n\nPutin's support in Russia is not big, but people are frightened, indifferent or just mind their own business. Needless to say that Rosgvardia, Russian kind of National Guard forces, is subordinate directly to Putin and roughly outnumbers all other police forces combined. So in case of any major uprising, the outcome will most likely be brutal.",

We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.\n\nPolish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl\n\nPlease share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.\n\nEDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER.

Two days ago, I read that within Russia, US intelligence reports were being dismissed by the public as part of an American misinformation campaign. But now that it's playing out \\*exactly as the US said it would,\\* it seriously undermines Putin's frequent talking point that the US is lying. \n\nI don't say any of this to chest-thump for the US, but to show how badly I think Putin has miscalculated. The approach the US took these past several weeks in publicly and frequently airing accurate intelligence has put Putin in a tough spot. There's no getting around the fact that he's been lying this whole time (to the world and to his own people), and that the US was telling the truth. \n\nThere's a universe where Putin could have NOT invaded Ukraine and actually made Biden look like an alarmist fool. But he didn't do that, and now he's the one who is coming across as irrational. No idea if this will lead to Putin's overthrow (wishful thinking) but hopefully it dulls his sheen within Russia and helps more Russians understand that he's not trustworthy.",

It's important to remain vigilant and cautious when interacting with strangers online, especially when it comes to sensitive political matters. Always do your own research before taking action or forming opinions.",

Regardless of who is behind it, it's important to remain vigilant and take any claims with a grain of salt until there is clear evidence to support them. At the end of the day, it's up to each individual to critically evaluate the information they receive and make informed decisions based on that.",

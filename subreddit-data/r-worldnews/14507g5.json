(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; While MFP is widely viewed as the most liberal of Thailand&amp;#039;s political parties, cannabis advocates say it is leading the drive to rein in recreational use, casting a pall over the country&amp;#039;s multibillion-dollar cannabis industry.\n\n&gt; Pita now says the cannabis boom should be put on pause to curb widespread recreational use until the incoming government can pass a proposed Cannabis Act to draw clear lines on where the drug can be sold and consumed.\n\n&gt; Taking advantage of the legal vacuum created by the failure to pass the Cannabis Act, Thais and tourists alike smoke openly on the streets and illegal imports - mainly from North America - have flooded the market, giving plenty of ammunition to critics of libertine cannabis culture.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1450dep/thailands_cannabis_lovers_face_comedown_amid/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688291 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **cannabis**^#1 **Thailand**^#2 **Ganja**^#3 **Pita**^#4 **Party**^#5",

The health minister last term announced the decriminalization far too early for the upcoming election without anything in place and ready and distributed it around for the votes. Right now it is controlled much less than cigarettes and alcohols. They open shop directly across from elementary schools, put it in the food without labeling, etc.",

Well, for both of those, they are available at every 7-11 everywhere in the country, and every supermarket and every family owned convenience store. Kids have been smoking and drinking in Thailand as long as I can remember. And there are no proposals to require people to have their data recorded for buying either one of those more dangerous substances.",

There are definitely stores selling alcohol and tobacco nears schools as well but they're not a target (example: near the Wat Passi school on Thonglo 20 there are multiple bars and \u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e49\u0e32 and 7-11, within 100m that sell alcohol and tobacco. \n\nAnd let's not pretend like kids live at school. \n\nI also have a close friend with a cannabis business and he has an 8 year old kid. And another friend who works for Boonrawd Breweries and he also has a kid. It's not like we can stop them from seeing that these places exist, and if they can't buy anything there what's the big deal? \n\nI'd like to see the police stop beggar kids from being on the street near Nana at 1am before we worry about dispensaries that happen to be near a school when no kids can even buy anything from them.\n\nThis is just politicians being selective based on what gets their favored policies through, not what's actually right. And certainly they don't care if it's hypocritical.",

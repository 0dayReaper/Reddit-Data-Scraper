[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/worldnews) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

Can you give a single example of land that was annexed by the US or claimed as such post WWII ?\n\nThey are also not commiting a genocide against a whole population, thank god they left that in the 19th century.\n\nWhile market access might not be absolutely perfect in the US, comparing it to how China operates is just such bad faith that I won't even try to argue on that. \n\nI am no fan of the US, and I especially despise the policy they have had in the Middle East. But if you consider how dominant the US has been in the post WWII, it might be the first time in history that the most powerful nation doesn't go on regional/world conquest spree. I can guarantee you that if  Russia or China had been in the same position, the world would be a much much more horrible place.\n\nChina and Russia see the world the same way: as a zero-sum game where there must be a loser and a winner. And they sure as hell don't want to be the loser.",

However, this is not the first time in history a nation that COULD go on a conquering spree doesn't.  I can only think of a few examples, and way more of countries that DID, but it isn't completely unique. To be fair, you did say it MIGHT be unique. And I agree with your assessment of Russia. I think china might be a tad more inward looking than that tho. They don't want conquest they want tribute and the old days of the middle kingdom back. I think they would be happy with their current borders plus Taiwan as long as everyone else performed the proper obsequiousness. But Taiwan is a sticking point (and should be).",

I don't see true socialism there, I see a bunch of authoritarian regimes that don't know how to operate within the boundaries of international law.   \n\n\nFrance, Laos, Vietnam, Portugal, all the nordic countries are all more socialist than any of the countries listed above, and Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Peru, Barbados, and others are all currently governed by socialist parties and all of them either cooperate with the US or other democratic nations.   \n\n\nThe difference isn't the economic system, it's the political system. With the exception of Saudi Arabia (which is largely due to historical foreign policy to counter Iran as well as loving oil, and its quite clear the Biden Administration wants to move away from that relationship), basically all of the US allies are democracies, not authoritarian states.",

You'd run out of nuclear weapons and the US and China would still have some cities and military left and most of the rest of the world would be untouched. The radiation drops to 1% of it's original value in about 48 hours because it's ONLY a flash a fusion, it's not a long term radioactive reactor that can EVER release that much radiation.  It's 99% just a big ass explosion and while that will devastate cities, there's not way to cover a country with it. \n\nLike in Hirshima there wasn't even birth defects over normal levels, the radiation doesn't work as a mass poison cloud as people believe. The vast majority of fallout is not radioactive, just the particulate from the epicenter and really does almost no damage compared to the fireball. The fallout is not like nuclear reactor fallout, it's much less refined and dangerous because a nuclear blast is just a flash of mostly fusion vs a long running fission reaction than produces long half-life waste.",

You need to be able to move men, stay agile and keep them supplied on various islands, China, having large land borders to defend cannot prioritise the Navy in the same way the Americans can or the British could in the 18th century.\n\nAdditionally, the US and its allies that would fight in the Pacific excluding Taiwan (UK, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines) bring the potential population pool to conscript from, up to around 700 million people. Each and every single one of those countries was involved in the island hopping Pacific war to varying extents and have militaries that remember the lessons from that war and have achives and archives of documentation on every nook and cranny of the Pacific from a wartime perspective.\n\nYou don't know what you're talking about, which doesn't surprise me.",

They just have top down CCP propaganda based government where 2+2 can equal 4 or 6 or whatever the CCP says and when you stress a network of systems not really built on solid ground.... they tend to tumble. The numbers are faked, the materials are fakes and the corruption runs rampant AND that works as long as the global money streams stays strong, but the second it doesn't it all goes to shit and you have like Covid Zero level supreme leader brilliant plan BS. That's what China really looks like under pressure and their best by, BY A FUCKING MILE, is to keep the western money and tech rolling in AND the best way to do that is to keep moving toward Democracy. \n\nA real Democratic China would be a point of global celebration and would definitely be a boom for China. It was always going to work out where if they got powerful their labor costs would go up and things would diversify against them, along with automation being a constant long term since like humans invested the wheel.\n\nI think they screwed up trying to raise wages up so fast in an effort to grow a middle class and become more independant, but when you have 1+ billion people the stage where you grow a middle class and form a circular/service economy takes a lot longer and they were no patient. Now they face deflation from high labor costs as well as deflation from military threats against Tawain, general lack of trust and rather constant espionage, inability to stand up to Russia and SLOWLY growing concerns over forced labor and authoritarianism in general.... but mostly it's just cheaper to make stuff in Vietnam and Mexico now. ;)",

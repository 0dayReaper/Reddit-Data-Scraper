Now imagine what Ukraine could (will) do with all kinds of support (exact opposite of sanctions).\n\nRussia has been using a variety of long range missiles against Ukraine. Give it a while and they'll be on the receiving end of missiles developed/manufactured in Ukraine.\n\nIt'll be a missile war, with missiles being used like artillery... but over far greater ranges. We may yet see Moscow getting hit by missiles. Not nukes, but missiles with conventional warheads launched from Ukraine.",

Even if the knowledge was already there (they could probably get it from the West), it takes *years* just to build the necessary infrastructure to produce them in significant numbers and even those 'significant numbers' would probably be less than you'd think.\n\nIt's nice Ukraine is looking into it, but this won't help them in this war.",

Add on maintenance cost, and the 30 year figure will probably be in the 2 tril range.  add on another nearly trillion for the bombers.  so probably will spend 3+ trillion over the next 30 years on our nuclear triad.\n\nNote - this is napkin math from vaguely remembered figures.\n\nAnd that is why nuclear weapons for most countries will not be the best 2nd strike weapons.  2nd strike capability is insanely expensive and without sufficient quantities, not full proof.",

We have one here and got a lecture from one of the leading people working there. You need like back-up-back-up power supplies on site, the building has to be literally 911 secured (direct impacts of ~~plains~~ planes), earthquakes, the whole list of crazy shit.\n\nFunny enough ours actually doesn\u2019t need to comply with one thing: they don\u2019t have to care about flooding because the building is up on a hill and we probably have different problems if there\u2019s a Tsunami hitting us at a couple hundred meters above ~~see~~ sea level, about a thousand kilometers away from the sea.\n\nI know this is /s but I felt like sharing",

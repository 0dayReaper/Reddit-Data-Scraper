This is a conundrum DWB and similar aid organizations deal with often, having to calculate the potential harm done by contributing to a harmful ideology vs the inevitable suffering that results from withholding aid. No good deed goes unpunished",

On the other hand if you're known to not do stuff like this then while some might still try to pressure you into it, overall you'll face it much less often. Especially if such attempts may end up in a backlash if it's known that these groups prevented aid from reaching certain places, because now not only will they not gain anything from it, they may even have losses.",

Being filmed making statements supporting a paramilitary group in a conflict zone is certainly against the normal guidelines for DWB staff. It\u2019s absolutely not normal or acceptable procedure as part of negotiating access to patients. If it was you would see a LOT more videos like these.",

So greed is one of the possible reasons.\nTo add to this, we are talking about people who have little to nothing. If they are dissidents, chances are they could not access those facilities without going unnoticed. While MSF/ICRC will accept any patients, local populations have their own interest and the words of mouth will quickly inform the authorities if an opponent is being treated (it's common they still come but under a false name and it some areas, we try as much as possible to provide privacy with closed rooms to prevent armed retaliations between different fighting groups within the facility or around).\n\nAlso, losing a hospital in an area will often bring political instability due to the loss of everything that comes with it. Whoever was in charge will lose their position. \nIn this context, attacking, coercing humanitarians is a way for an armed group not in power to destabilize the current power in place or current organization. Without a hospital, people might leave to a place where they can get trestment. Strategy is another possible reason. For example during the sudanese civil war and after, Khartum was often shelling the Nuba people. They were aiming for humanitarian facilities as well so those were hidden under trees to not be visible from the sky.\n\nSource: I'm a humanitarian who worked in this area for a few years.",

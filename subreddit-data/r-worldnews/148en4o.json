[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We have been reasonably effective at stopping or curtailing wildfires in past years, so we have a lot more old stuff that is ready to burn that we might otherwise, making it even easier for these fires to spread. That and the hot, dry climate we're getting lately is making it a literal tinderbox.\n\nI should point out that by 'in past years' I am referring to some decades worth of years. In 2019 we had the worst air quality I've ever seen due to wildfires -- the orange sky that New York had recently was our life for a few days back then. For the past week now our air quality index has been consistently terrible. We had a reprieve for a few days before that, and then a week of still terrible. Just not 'orange sky' terrible. Just grey, and you can't really see tall buildings in the distance.",

One way is fire.  \n  \nThe paradigm you quote about conifers needing regular fires to reproduce was definitely a very temporary thing. Right now the boreal woodlands are undergoing heat stress and stress from boring beetles en masse. Prepare for 50-100 million hectare burn seasons.",

Buy second-hand clothing and other items. Minimize buying new technology (we don't need electric scooters, smartwatches and new phones every year). Minimize flying. Boycott companies that are harmful.\n\nIf you find it in you, you can also facilitate conversation about local and global environmental issues. Organize a garbage collecting operation. Set up grassroots conversation and activism events. Work a career in green solutions. Use the skills and resources you have available to you. Be creative. Get to know people.

For me it's mostly one long straight road, it doesn't wind and has very few changes in elevation, it makes for a genuinely relaxing drive and a great hour in the morning and afternoon to listen to podcasts or audio books. I find the same amount of time spent on a different road exhausts me too.",

All the evergreen needles, all the deciduous leafs, all the dead grass and brush and trees, that all *needs* to be burned - and historically it would be. Certain evergreens rely as an evolutionary strategy for the heat of a fire to release their seeds from their cones. Look at the hills in the spring where a fire burned the summer previous\u2026 it\u2019s always the greenest. All that carbon that was tied up in dead vegetation returned to the soil, ready to be used by the next generation. \n\nBut people came and built houses and when structures are threatened we put out the fires, so the deadfall accumulates on the forest floor. Do this for a century and then add year after year of unseasonably hot summers. Add to that an unusual number of trees killed by pests such as the mountain pine beetle, who were able to thrive and wipe out vast swaths of the BC lodgepole pines because the winters were too warm and the fires not allowed to run their course and you end up with what we have here today.\n\nSource: I\u2019m a trained wildfire fighter and FireSmart BC ambassador and fire safety trainer.",

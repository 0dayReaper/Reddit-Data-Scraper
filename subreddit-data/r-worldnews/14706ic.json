You take out the railroad and bomb the road so Russians have a way of retreating and they can't resupply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course you can also take them as POWs which is valuable asset to trade in peace negotiations but having the land back should be enough for Russia to search for a way out of this mess. At least that's my opinion because by losing Crimea they lost the most valuable thing that they took.\n\nEdit: Of course Ukraine knows more than we so the decision to let them retreat will be based on their spies. If they think Russia will search for a way out they will let them retreat but if they think Russia will fight until the bitter end then it's better to take them as POWs so Russia can't use them as a cannon fodder.",

It's longer, and more perilous, but it's a far more viable retreat corridor than a resupply route. With the dam gone, the bridge also becomes the only really viable route to bring in large volumes of water. Cut it off and holding Crimea may become an untenable siege position for Russia. However untenable, the psychological impact of losing Crimea may be too high for Putin to bear, and as a result he may commit excessive resources to the effort in a massive tactical blunder that Ukraine can capitalize on. Destroying the bridge forces Russia into a bunch of bad options, but nonetheless leaves them with options other than \"fight to the last man\".",

Stuff you can do on a soviet derived plane would stall a western plane and vice versa.

Muscle memory is a hard beast to overcome.",

Ukraine will almost certainly not want ANY business with russia for a decade or so, plus they've got billions worth of more useful rebuilding to do, so they actually won't want the bridge repaired (and especially won't pay a dime to do it), meanwhile russia might want it repaired potentially.\n\nIn short, there's no chance BOTH want it fixed up, so what's going to happen in the longer run? Definitely a span or two is getting dropped before the war is out, but what's going to happen to the rest? Is it just going to sit there and gradually decay for decades?\n\nI can see Ukraine just enjoying this massive decaying monument to russia's failure, and I can potentially see russia just dropping the whole thing \"to prevent it's capture\".",

You know what kind of damage from an explosion takes just four hours to fix? Pretty much all of them if it doesn't involved derailed trains, but even then they are fairly easy to fix.\n\nYou asking a question like that shows you don't know how well easy it is to fix track and damage.  Infrastructure like railway bridges are a different story, but specialized machines exist to quickly get rail cars out of the way or make on track very quickly, and replacing track segements is fairly easy as well. Russia for all it's fault, is actually one of the best at repairing rail, mainly because they rely on it so heavily for their entire country.\n\nThis is also why for the most part train tracks aren't targeted much. Unless it's a bridge or something substantial, it almost becomes a waste because it only causes delays measured in hours not days. It can be useful some times, but often it's not and the people performing the attacks are well meaning partisans doing what they can to waste and resources or slow things in any way.",

Blowing up a train bridge though is very effective depending on how large the bridge is.\n\nThis is the same as runway cratering. It is only a small delay till the potholes are filled in and military air bases have equipment to quickly do that.\n\nFor a train they can quickly replace the tracks and fill in any dirt that needs to be fixed.\n\nThere are YouTube videos showing how they do this.",

Obviously if a hole isn't found for 2 days it didn't take 3 days to fix it lol. But 4 hours to fill in dirt and replace a track once equipment get's there? Yup not even an issue done in half the time, and usually get's there within an hour or two.(when discovered/reported/dispatched)",

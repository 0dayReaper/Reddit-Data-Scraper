[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sure, if you live in Moscow or St Petersburg, you will do better than the rest of the country, but for the other 80% of the population, things aren\u2019t great.\nRent will easily be 75% of your salary, hence a lot of Russians moving in together and getting married earlier, resource pooling.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m sorry to say, a cashier is absolutely not able to afford a place and be comfortable.\n\nBut yeah, housing is largely affordable - and generally pretty well thought out. Every block of units has everything you need within a 10-15 minute walk. Public transport is also really good in Russia, especially in bigger cities.\n\nWork culture is also different. Russians on average work a lot, 50-60 hour weeks for 3-4USD an hour are pretty common but everyone hates and it criticise it openly. Their is no \u201cgrind mindset\u201d in Russia (except maybe in Moscow - that place is intense).",

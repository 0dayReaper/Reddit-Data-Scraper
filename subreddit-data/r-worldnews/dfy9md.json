It's disgusting tendrils have seeped into nearly every aspect of our daily lives as citizens, even our escapes from daily life. Our elections have historically been tainted, our economy has been controlled at the whim of political ambition, and now something as benign as speaking out in support of Democracy within a US based video game league has become convoluted with corporate interests prioritizing profits over our most basic American rights.\n\n\n&gt;I know how stupid, cringy, and cliche it may sound but \"First they came\" by Martin Niem\u00f6ller is incredibly relevant to this day. Two weeks ago we thought that the censorship of China couldn't reach us in such a stupid way but now look where we are. This isn't Ok and we need to stand in solidarity to fully support every Democracy.\n\n&gt;https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative\n\n&gt;https://www.senate.gov/general/contacting.htm\n\nI posted that in /r/Blizzard from an obvious perspective. If this whole debacle has taught me anything, it's been about my own ignorance in regards to foreign influence. Censorship is affecting something as menial as a video game tournament in the \"land of free speech\". \n\nWhat the fuck.",

South Park, Book of Mormon, Team America, the new wave South Park video games; hell, even their songs are memorable and quotable (Blame Canada, America Fuck Yeah). They get endless accolades from an industry they don\u2019t stop shitting on, and they acknowledge that humour cannot and should not have any barriers or limits, as otherwise we create a generation of hypersensitive individuals that can\u2019t take even the slightest joke without being offended (e.g. PC Principal). South Park, in some strange twist of irony, gives us a sobering view of society despite the fact that it was initially created to ridicule society, and both creators know this themselves. I look forward to their next project.",

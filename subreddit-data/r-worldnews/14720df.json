The kids have quite a good understanding of the jungle, edible fruits and seeds (that they ate after the flour they found on the plane was gone), all thanks to cultural background. They had learned from their parents and grandparents. \n\nI find it amazing and very inspiring to see in practice how this knowledge played a big part in giving them the tools for their survival.",

A 3yo spilling their cereal all over the place is a 5 year old who can make it with fewer mishaps. A 6 yo smearing butter or jam all over is a 7 yo who can make toast for themselves and the rest of the family at breakfast time.",

Ammunition can be unstable and unpredictable, so it's important to handle it carefully. However, this ban may not be enough to prevent accidents entirely. It's always best to educate yourself on safe handling practices and follow all safety guidelines when using ammunition. Stay safe out there, folks!",

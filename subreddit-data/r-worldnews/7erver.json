People are already feeling the squeeze from media providers with internet, cell service, and cell phone costs constantly increasing in price and media publishers revoking content licenses to start their own streaming services. Consumers don't have infinite money, and people are going to start cutting things out if costs keep going up. I think this move will be more disruptive to the current service landscape than anything, potentially having a dramatic impact on the overall usefulness of the internet for anyone. And if the internet is made significantly less useful, who's going to pay hundreds of dollars a month to maintain access?",

If you deem it worthy. \n\nGood morning Commissioner Carr,\n\n\n\nIt has come to my attention that the FCC plans to vote to repeal Net Neutrality in the coming days. This will harm small businesses and greatly hurt consumers in order to boost the control and profits of a few large companies. The current argument is that the market will regulate these companies and keep costs and prices low, as is the way with capitalism. Normally this is absolutely correct but let me paint the bigger picture that I feel is unknown to those on the FCC. The issue with this free market argument when it comes to the internet is simple: in many places in America, there is only one option. Often times in both cities and rural areas the companies divide the market by city block or rural town. As a resident of LA, I only have access to one provider in my apartment complex, and my family, as residents of rural Ohio, only have one provider in their town. This effectively blocks the normal self-regulation that is the backbone of successful capitalism.  Simply put, the market will NOT self-regulate in this case, and repealing Net Neutrality will instead allow these companies to gain a further monopoly in their areas, and stifle the growth of small business by charging high prices in order to expand their bottom line, as is the objective of all business. I highly urge you to take the pro-consumer, American spirited route rather than feeding the greed of a few small corporations. Innovation and competition are what make America great, and it simply cannot be done when the market is unable to self-regulate. Remember, next year is an election year, make the choice that will benefit both you and the American people, you get to stay in power, we get to keep a competitive capitalist market for the internet. It's a win-win!\n\nSincerely,\n*Your name* a concerned citizen of the United States of America",

            "comment": "I have hesitated talking about certain past life experiences for the sake of just not putting any sort of spot light but you know what, fuck it, this is important. I've lived in places in the middle east where the internet was not free and open. Where access was granted and denied at the whim of other people and you know what? It's fucking awful.\n\nNow, the scope of what I am talking about is in many ways different from what the FCC is talking about here. It's not nearly as bad, however, I feel like there are some relevant crossovers to mention.\n\nFirst of all, since there were no laws or policies in place to protect the customer, internet companies could basically do whatever the hell they wanted. Do you know why? Because they are basically owned by the state they operate in. 68% of Ooredoo is owned by the state of Qatar, Etisalat; the 14th largest mobile network operator in the world 60% of it owned by the UAE. So here is some shit they can pull. And this isn't just a problem in the middle eastern gulf, this happens in all kinds of places in the middle east that do not necessarily practise censorship.\n\nFirst of all, they absolutely throttle your access to certain online services. For example, teamspeak. This is such a thing in certain countries it is hilarious. Teamspeak is a VOIP application for gamers yet for whatever reason, there are certain places where you just cannot use it. You will find yourself being throttled for the seemingly most random things and you will never know why. This is literally the kind of thing net neutrality protects us all from. Your ISP doesn't like the fact that a lot of people are using discord or netflix for example? Throttle the shit out of it or charge a shit ton of money. Oh this is the best one. ETISALAT LITERALLY BLOCKS MESSENGER, VIBER AND ALL OTHER VOIP SERVICES. Why? So that people can only use their own mobile network to call overseas. It is literally the most annoying thing ever. I cannot call my family in the UAE on messenger or any of those services because it is literally blocked so that they have to pay money to call on the regular phone network. What is to stop companies like Verizon or Comcast from doing this??\n\nCensorship. Now yes, nothing about this FCC decision will come into the realm of censorship eh? But how can you be so sure? The fact that companies like ooreedoo and etisilat are primarily owned by the state, means that they have blocked all immoral content; porn websites, hell even things that aren't even porn but have someone dressed in a lewd manner. They have blocked any site that critiques their governments, sexual health resources for pete's sake, dating services etc.\n\nWill there ever come a day where now that net neutrality has been done away with where partisan congress members can push for the restriction of sexual health services for example because it goes against their ideals? I mean what is to say that there won't be any collusion between government representatives and internet providers over the semantics of what is subject to heavier prices, access or restrictions?\n\nThis is of course assuming the worst, but we cannot pretend that people will not try to use this to their advantage. Not to mention that this pigeon holes people's free access to so many things. Let's say I am writing a paper for school and reach my limit for a certain database, website or whatever it may be. Then what? Am I supposed to move on to more sanctioned resources that I will have longer access to? Why? Why can't I just use what I want. What if I am an alcoholic and I come to reddit everyday because I am part of a support community. What will happen once I cannot come back here to talk to my community and I cannot afford to \"unlock reddit\".\n\nI try my best to see any redeeming qualities of doing away with net neutrality but I have already experienced the very bare minimum of it minus the censorship and it actually fucking sucks.\n\nI am so thankful and privileged to have become a Canadian and to now be living in Canada. Sometimes we cannot really visualise just exactly how good we have it until we experience it about 1000 times worse. Please Americans, do not do this to yourselves, value what you have without having to learn just how much it means to all of you because it was taken away.",

The stairs are free to use, but if you want to get to your store faster, you'll have to pay to use the elevators. \n\nAnd the whole time you're shopping, some guy with a helmet head and plastered on smile will follow you around singing ditties about how cool the mall is while trying to curl your hair.

The danger of the mayority of the people supporting that is low.\nHowever there are more things that can be done without proper net neutrality. In Europe, providers started to bundle subscriptions with third party services. To the customer this could mean: Get a T-Mobile subscription, get Spotify for free! The danger of the mayor public supporting this is very high!\nIt sounds great but;\n1) The ISP's are taking money from both sides, clients and services!\n2) If you get free mobile streaming from a certain service it means the connection is unencrypted or the ISP is effectively using a man-in-the-middle attack to track what you're doing. That is also making your data vulnerable.\n3) They don't have to block certain parts of the internet because who is going to look for an alternative if Spotify is included with your subscription? That's unfair competition and even destroying any opportunity for low-budget start-ups to have any chance at gaining popularity.\n\nNet neutrality stops these practices so the Spotify/Netflix of the future has a fair opportunity to bloom. You are able to have a secure, private connection to the internet without anyone with money on his mind snooping around. Collateral damage would include a ban on VPN services.\n \nSo yeah having a good Net Neutrality law is a must but stopping Net Neutrality law is much easier with free candy for consumers. So beware and make sure every not-tech-savvy person is informed on the risk!",

I have always been proud to be an American citizen, with our flaws and our strengths. This last year has been a shameful nightmare for the American people. The people in power and influence aren't even trying to be discreet with their selfish ambitions, and its the voters and citizens who will suffer for the benefit of someone else.\n\nNet Neutrality is not some evil scheme by the Democrats; Obama is not some sort of supervillain whose wake of terror and malice has to be repealed and cleaned up. The diversity between the two major political parties in this country is worse than ever. Politicians don't care to better this country for all, they only care about their team having the most points. It's a disgusting way to live and it hurts all of us. This current issue is only the most recent disgrace to come to the attention of Congress to pass through. There is no advantage to giving a handful of major ISP companies the right to extort money for access to the internet. There are countries that have free internet service and there are countries that consider internet access a basic human right these days. The United States won't even consider water a basic human necessity, for the sake of a company that won't spare any expense to make more money.\n\nRepealing Net Neutrality is just handing the keys to a daycare center to a famously aggressive and unsympathetic bully. These bullies want more control, more money, and they don't care who they have to harm to get it. The fact that multiple, countless fake identities were made to spread false information to promote the repealing of Net Neutrality should indicate that this is an evil, amoral and twisted idea that even its promoters are aware of. If this was good for the the people of this country at all, there would be actual support of it.\n\nI am so ashamed to have to live in a country where the people are going unheard, and blatantly self-serving laws are being passed. Net Neutrality is one idea that was already voted against, and here we are again, begging and pleading for some rational thought and compassion to find the hearts of the people that determine the fate of this country that we all live in.\n\nAre we citizens of this country, or are we marks for companies to take for all we have? Net Neutrality isn't even the beginning, but with every selfish law being passed that puts the boot to the necks of the citizens, we find ourselves inching closer to the end. This once great country may not even survive another ten years. I can barely see the light of hope in the darkness that grows greater every day.\n\nIf this law passes, and we the people are subject to the whims of a few greedy businesses, you may as well change \u201cWe the People\u201d to \u201cWe the Corporations.\u201d\n\nFor the love of decency, for the sake of a brighter future, for the chance that future generations may transform our country into a great nation once again, I beg you to see reason. Net Neutrality must not be repealed. Make me, and others, proud to be American citizens once again.\n\nOur current president vowed to make America great again. He's going the wrong way.",

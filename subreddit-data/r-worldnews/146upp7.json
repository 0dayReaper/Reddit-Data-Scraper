The pro-life movement touts the availability of adoption for the babies of mothers that are unable to raise their newborn. Yet children of POC mothers or same sex couples are usually unable to be adopted or adopt. As in Animal Shelters the cute puppies or kittens are adopted first and the rest are unwanted and time out. In the case of AS euthanasia and for children into the foster care program. It\u2019s easy to empathize with the cute puppy or baby, not so easy with the truculent teen or mature dog. So getting them out of the system should be goal number one, not creating artificial barriers.",

Sounds inefficient and slow, but works pretty well when you're testing millions of known logins for people across a bunch of machines, you're bound to get a good bit of working logins for the service you're targeting.\n\n\"kio\" was meant to point out the second-to-last line in the picture of email and passwords that was posted a few comments above. Having \":VK.com\" at the end of it makes it look like it came from a giant list in the format of \"email:password:website\". \n\nOn top of that, a state actor that is known for aggressive and sophisticated cyberattacks would definitely not be storing passwords in the plaintext, and this also doesn't look like how any kind of database schema/formatting would look when dumped to a file.",

I want the United States to support Ukraine in all forms possible, be that sanctions, freezing assents or Military aid. I realize the high cost which I am requesting, to quote late philosopher John Stuart Mill: \u201cLet not any one pacify his conscience by the delusion that he can do no harm if he takes no part, and forms no opinion. Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.\u201d\n\nThank you for your time and service to the people of the United States of America \n\nRespectfully \n\nYour name here",

Mqybe minutes depending on specifics.\n\nUse a password manager. Even a free one. You arent as good at creating passwords as you think you are. Or at the very minimum change your passwords every so often. Technology advances rapidly and your passwords from few years ago may not be secure anymore.",

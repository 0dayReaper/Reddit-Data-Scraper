This is the first time since August 2022 that Canada has lost jobs.\n\n&gt; Statistics Canada reports the industries that lost the most jobs in May were business, building and other support services, which lost 31,000 jobs, equivalent to a 4.4 per cent decline overall.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1456r49/canada_lost_17000_jobs_in_may_mostly_among_youth/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688342 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Canada**^#1 **jobs**^#2 **per**^#3 **cent**^#4 **lost**^#5",

In May it is around the time students start summer jobs, they expected there to be 17,000 more summer jobs started then what was reported.\n\nSo they report that 17,000 jobs were lost compared to what is expected.\n\n\nOver the course of a year, the size of the labor force, the levels of employment and unemployment, and other measures of labor market activity undergo fluctuations due to seasonal events including changes in weather, harvests, major holidays, and school schedules. Because these seasonal events follow a more or less regular pattern each year, their influence on statistical trends can be eliminated by seasonally adjusting the statistics from month to month. These seasonal adjustments make it easier to observe the cyclical, underlying trend, and other nonseasonal movements in the series.",

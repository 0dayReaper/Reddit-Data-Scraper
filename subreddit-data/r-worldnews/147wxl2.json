[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I suspect you will argue that this is the Palestinian's fault for not accepting and agreement.  The counter-argument is that what Israel offered seemingly amounted to a series of bantustans lacking any meaningfull sovereignty.\n\nTo claim that genuine peace effortsled to the Intifada is disingenious to the extreme.\n\nAs you well know, your numbers of casualities are completely off, but you probably assumed the people who know little about Palestine/Israel wouldn't bother to check.",

Without a map showing where the US and Israel (who'd discussed it prior to Palestine being brought in) were drawing those borders, there was no way to know what those percentages actually represented. When they asked both the US and Israel for that map though they were stonewalled, and because of that the talks ended up stalling for months and eventually falling through",

But the systemic landscape would also have to change and would have had to change in 1940s too.\n\nIn 1947 the systems that had been passed down from the ottomans and the British were systems of exclusion and competition. Just making a new country for both Jews and Palestinian Arabs wouldn't have changed that.\n\nWe have constitutional protections in the United States but the systems of oppression still exist and still reinforce a set system.\n\nI am in favor of a Two State Solution for matters of practicality. Though a Bi National State aligns more ideologically with me i don't think it's achievable by being ordained by outside powers. A Binational state in Israel Palestine will require first the full liberation of the West Bank and Gaza, the establishment of a Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza and then the slow normalization of ties between Israel and Palestine until both parties democratically choose to embrace this kind of cohabitation.",

Plus prior to the first aliyah, less than 5% or something like 20 000 people living there were Jewish. Then boom, Zionism was born, a lot of people immigrated from elsewhere because it was their \"ancestral homeland\". They still weren't the majority though, hence the liberal dose of ethnic cleansing during the 1948 war. You need a Jewish majority for a Jewish state. And you can't really be a democracy and a Jewish state at the same time because that majority needs to be maintained. Plus just imagine living in a country that exists to your exclusion but only tolerates you as a necessary evil. And that's without even getting into the occupation.",

Granted, I didn\u2019t read the article and don\u2019t know where these particular settlements are.\n\nIn my understanding, there are two types of settlements. \n\nOne type, the super fucked up type, directly abuts an existing Palestinian urban/suburban center and oftentimes \u201crequires\u201d Palestinian homes in the area to be demolished in favor of security walls and new construction for Jews.\n\nThe other type, the less fucked up but still wrong type, is where the settlement is built on undeveloped land in the west bank. This sometimes involves building or utilizing \u201cprivate\u201d roads that lead straight into Israel proper and Palestinians need to cross checkpoints to use these roads or are otherwise banned. \n\nThe problem in both situations is that the Palestinian people have refused for generations to establish a real civil society/government that keeps proper records of land title, sales, etc., instead using limited resources to manage relations between different factions of terrorists, revolutionaries, and civil/religious groups while attempting to ensure basic welfare. \n\nNow, Israel certainly hasn\u2019t made it any easier for the PA to evolve its level of governance. But it\u2019s so corrupt too, and it really burdens the Palestinian people whose property rights are not protected by their own governing body. So when these settlement developers come in and buy the land for bona fide purchase value, Israel steps in with military force and says the buyer owns the land, and their title to it is better than the loosely tracked (if recorded at all) property interest in land that some Palestinian family says they\u2019ve held for however many generations. Israel isn\u2019t willing to stop developers from building on land in the hills that some family says they once used to herd sheep 80 years ago and haven\u2019t built anything on.",

It's not even one square kilometer, and like maybe a couple hundred people actually live inside its borders, all of whom have dual citizenship in other countries.

Also important to remember that these deals were offered by Israel, who the Palestinians had attacked in all out war multiple times and in indivisible individual attacks thousands of times. It\u2019s incredible Israel offered them anything, but Israel certainly had very good reason to require guarantees of their safety in any deal. \n\nAlso not sure what you\u2019re talking about regarding 1948, since the deal offered to Arafat offered almost all of that land. But regardless, the Palestinians could have had ALL of the land offered to them in 1948. Know how? Simply by accepting the UN Partition Plan, which the Israelis accepted. \n\nThe UN might be built on that premise, but A) Israel didn\u2019t take the land from Palestinians, they took it from Jordan and Egypt, neither of whom offered to make the Palestinians their own state in the 19 years they controlled it, and B) A place like Jordan was brand spanking new. These aren\u2019t old, established borders. Jordan was given their country like Israel and the Palestinians were supposed to be. They then went out and attacked the newly founded Israel, GAINED some territory in that, no one said boo. When they attacked Israel again in 1967 and LOST territory, suddenly we have wonderful humanitarians like yourself crying about no more right of conquest. All good and fine when it works against the Israelis, no good when it works for them.",

Jewish migration to the region had been going on with increasing intensity since the 1870s, and many Jews had never left the region anyways. It was this long-term migration that created the demographic realities on the ground in 1948, which led to Israel's creation. Regardless of what the UN \"decreed\", Israel was attacked the day it declared its own independence, and it won the war for its initial survival. That isn't \"UN-mandated\" at all.",

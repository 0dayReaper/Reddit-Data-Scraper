Basically \u201cyou can\u2019t suspend me from the house because I quit first\u201d.\n\nCouple options for Nadine:\n\n1. Sunak made sure she didn\u2019t get a peerage so as to avoid a humiliating by-election, and this is revenge\n\n2. Nadine stayed loyal to Boris till the end and she\u2019s disgusted by the Tory MPs who investigated partygate and the outcome, and this is revenge\n\n3. She\u2019s implicated in the partygate report\n\nPersonally I think it\u2019s a combination of 1 and 2. She\u2019s petty enough for 1, sycophantic enough for 2, and she\u2019s got no shame so 3\u2019s out\u2026q",

And he can't even regain his usa citizenship.\n\nThe loss of U.S. nationality, including instances in which the loss was caused by voluntary renunciation, can be challenged in an administrative proceeding with the Department of State or by filing a lawsuit seeking to regain U.S. citizenship in a United States District Court.   It may be possible to regain citizenship showing by demonstrating in one of these two forums that the renunciation of citizenship was done under duress or was the result of a psychological condition that inhibited decision-making. As a practical matter, seeking reinstatement of citizenship through a lawsuit is expensive and procedurally difficult, in part because of the costs of federal litigation, confusing rules regarding the proper court in which to bring such a lawsuit and a five-year statute of limitations.",

Im sorry, when you consider the following main areas the budget went, I question really how much was pocketed by that ex sainsburys CEO who is best mates with BoJo?\n\nContract to use AWS on a subscription for 2years. \n\nIT dev team to make tracing software in AWS.\n\nGeneral admin/office/HR &amp; management heirarchy to operate the service &amp; handle the agents\n\nThe call agents themselves. \n\nSubscription to a telephony software, namely 'Timeforstorm' which is some random business in London with 2 people working there when I checked last in 2021. \n\nObviously there will be random misc costs too, but these should be the majority of the budget. So in terms of figures, there was probably a few thousand agents at any given time, who were assigned to 1 team leader for every 20-50 agents. Every 7-10 team leaders had an operations manager.\n\nSo when you consider the human cost to pay the wages on top of the IT stuff, where exactly did the figure 13.4billion come from? Genuinely I think everyone from agents to ops managers cost less than a billion, probably by a fair bit too. I mean the agents were earning just over min wage. Team leaders werent much better at just 20-23ish thousand per year depending on experience. \n\nIts all so fucking dodgy &amp; I actually want someone with the right authority to bring attention to these points, asking the right questions. How much *did* these things cost? Where did the budget go? Who audited the financial records? Will anybody investigate?\n\nIt makes my blood boil thinking how much the average citizen has been suffering in this country. Nothing but cutbacks and inflating costs in the past few years, yet BoJo finds it fit to rob us blind while attempting to gaslight us.",

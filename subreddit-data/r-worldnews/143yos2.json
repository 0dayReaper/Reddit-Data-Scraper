I wonder if they banned amateur radio now, it seemed permitted even a year ago...might indicate some level of internal paranoia, or they requisitioned radio equipment from civilians.",

To treat it with excitement as if it\u2019s a board game is disgusting, and I feel like a chump for having that perspective in the first place.\n\n\nI hope they take it back, all the way to the old borders, but I\u2019m gonna treat it with the serious emphasis it deserves and not infantilise the sacrifice these men are making for their country.",

It is grim work and everything about the situation is horrible but it is right and necessary and they deserve to be cheered on. Sometime soon each and every one of them will need emotional support to keep doing this awful work. So it's both serious and kind of our job to be enthusiastic in spite of the terribleness of what's really happening to real people. \n\nBut I really hate the video game analogies, I must say. Those get to me.\n\nI say go get 'em boys and girls. You're on. Knock 'em dead. ;)",

Like - they don't use pallets and forklifts etc. They just manually lift every small thing into and out of the trucks. Which means that it takes a much longer time to get everything ready to ship.

He said they stacked corpses for a day or two in the below zero temps as a barrier when his corps were bogged down and repelling German assaults, until relief and logistics came to support them.  Two days later, the support troops from the US broke the German line.  RIP Frosty.\n\nFor what it's worth.  War is hell.

Ukraine has conducted counteroffensive operations with differential outcomes in at least three sectors of the front as part of wider counteroffensive efforts that have been unfolding since Sunday, June 4.  \n2. Ukrainian forces conducted a limited but still significant attack in western Zaporizhia Oblast on the night of June 7 to 8. Russian forces apparently defended against this attack in a doctrinally sound manner and had reportedly regained their initial positions as of June 8.  \n3. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) responded to the Ukrainian attack with an uncharacteristic degree of coherency and praised Southern Military District elements for repelling the attack and regaining lost positions.  \n4. Russian sources provided explanations for claimed Russian successes during the June 8 attacks, praising Russian forces\u2019 effective use of electronic warfare (EW) systems, air support, and landmines against Ukrainian forces.  \n5. Russian forces appear to have executed their formal tactical defensive doctrine in response to the Ukrainian attacks southwest of Orikhiv.  \n6. Ukrainian attacks in western Zaporizhia on June 8 do not represent the full extent of Ukrainian capabilities in the current counteroffensive.  \n7. It is additionally noteworthy that the Russian Southern Military District Forces deployed in this particular area are likely to be a higher quality force grouping than Russia has elsewhere in theater, and their defensive performance is unlikely to be reflective of defensive capabilities of Russian groupings elsewhere on the front.  \n8. Russian forces and occupation authorities continue to exacerbate the humanitarian ramifications of the flooding resulting from the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant (KHPP) dam break.  \n9. Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly postponed his annual press conference from June 2023 until November or December 2023.\nRussian forces continued to conduct limited ground attacks on the Kupyansk-Svatove line and around Kreminna.  \n10. Ukrainian forces made limited gains around Bakhmut, and Russian forces conducted limited ground attacks along the Avdiivka-Donetsk City line.\nUkrainian forces continued to conduct limited ground attacks on the administrative border between Donetsk and Zaporizhia oblasts.  \n11. The Russian MoD continues to posture itself as a firm authority over the defense industrial base (DIB) through emphasizing its ability to transport new equipment to the front.  \n12. Russian occupation authorities are reportedly resorting to punitive measures against civilian populations in occupied Ukraine due to Russian occupation authorities\u2019 decreasing influence over civilians.",

Their luck at avoiding counterbattery fire will also run out in the coming days.  The Germans were pushed off Omaha beach and out of El Alamein because they ran out of shells. Stormshadow (and maybe GLSDB) will ensure the Russian defense will suffer the same fate. \n\nOnce the Russian guns are sufficiently suppressed, the Ukrainians can take their sweet time clearing the minefields, and by then the offensive speed will be limited by how fast the bulldozers can plough mines out of the way. So expect a couple more weeks of hard fighting before significant progress is made.",

Better to pound those defenses first, but then your enemy knows you are coming. Typically the Americans don\u2019t give a fuck about the element of surprise.

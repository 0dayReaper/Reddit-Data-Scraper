At 87 years old he has already exceeded the average life expectancy for an American, and so can look forward to a few more happy years of life as a billionaire, and also will escape the worst consequences of climate change the rest of us will have to endure in the near future.\n\nWin-win!",

No democracy was ever going to institute the kinds of restrictions required, not if they hope to last more than 1 term.  Look up the reaction Carter got just for suggesting Americans put on a sweater instead of turning up the heat during an energy crisis.  \n\nNow imagine a first world government trying to institute gasoline rationing, or controls that would drive meat prices through the roof.\n\nWe are either going technology our way out of this mess or it's all going to collapse.",

Reagan undid all his initiatives. 40+ years of potential positive steps erased. We got a second chance in 2000 but even by then, time was running out and SCOTUS took the decision out of our hands.",

So many people are for climate policies and such but then only like a *quarter* of said people even bother to vote. Shocker it doesn't work. \n\nI know for Americans they love to perpetuate the \"oh it doesn't matter cause gerrymandering\" and yet trump lost the reelection when people were actually galvanized to vote. And even *that* wasn't close to everyone voting. Meanwhile us in Japan don't even have *that* excuse for our political apathy. \n\nSeriously it'd be nice if before just assuming \"it's pointless\" everyone tried it all together just once, we would probably be surprised",

According to Oxfam, the richest 1 percent grabbed nearly two-thirds of all new wealth worth $42 trillion created since 2020, almost twice as much money as the bottom 99 percent of the world's population. In other words, just the top 1% of the wealthy managed to steal almost a quarter of the required wealth to address climate change in just two years. Evidently, the rich could *easily* address climate change and not even break a sweat - and worse, they could have done it any time in the last 50 years. Instead, they chose to actively undermine and suppress climate data to continue exploiting the world\u2019s resources for personal wealth. They will live in infamy as the bloated, disgusting, selfish psychopaths that they are, forever on the wrong side of history.",

They bribed politicians to get rid of clean energy investments, public transportation and electric vehicles.  Companies like Exxon knew climate change was real decades ago and hid that information deliberately and lied about it for decades.\n\n[ExxonMobil: Oil giant predicted climate change in 1970s - scientists](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-64241994#:~:text=ExxonMobil's%20private%20research%20predicted%20how,ExxonMobil%20denied%20the%20allegations.)\n\nMeanwhile, companies like Fox News continue spreading disinformation about climate change in an effort to get more Republicans elected who will do the bidding of the fossil fuel industry.\n\n[Fox News is full-on denying the wildfire crisis](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/wildfire-smoke-fox-news-climate-rcna88434)\n\n&gt;On Wednesday, Fox News host Laura Ingraham introduced Steve Milloy as a \u201csenior legal fellow at the Energy and Environment Legal Institute and Trump-era transition team member\u201d on her show, after which he proceeded to barrage viewers with the misinformation that the smoke from the wildfires isn't harmful. He disseminated that nonsense with the nonchalance and shamelessness befitting a former professional Big Oil and Big Tobacco propagandist. I guess that's the kind of person you have to reach out to as an expert when you're in the business of climate denialism.\n\n&gt;According to Milloy, there is no \"health risk\" associated with wildfire smoke. Americans, he argued, are simply succumbing to \"anxiety.\" That is false. As anyone who has ever inhaled smoke can intuit, it's not something that's meant to be in one's lungs. And this is not a source of debate or controversy among scientists and public health experts.\n\nConservatives are evil.  They are a deadly threat to our lives.  They must be removed from power for our survival.",

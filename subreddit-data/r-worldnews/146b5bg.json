And this trade has happened using that part of the deal which is still going on among Iran and P+4 and UN (US exit the deal as Trump didn't find it a very logical deal while the other parties are still in the deal).",

The deal was literally just a small pause in developing nukes in exchange for lifting sanctions and allowing the Iranian government to swell with money, power, resources, and influence so it would be harder when we finally were forced to address the issue. \n\nMeanwhile, Iran continued to export terrorism like in 2015 when Bahraini security forces discovered a large Iranian funded and operated terrorist bomb-making factory in Nuwaidrat or when journalists reported that Iranian soldiers were in Iraq \u201cburning people alive in their houses, playing soccer with severed human heads, and ethnically cleansing and razing whole villages to the ground.\" Not to mention planning multiple failed assassinations in countries around the world.\n\nI\u2019m not saying there is a perfect way to handle such a complex and menacing problem, yet imho Iran was just getting stronger as we continued to find ways of kicking the can down the road rather than actually solving the problem.",

The deal was actually made it possible in away that if Iran respects the nuclear restrictions within the next five years (from 2015), all UN ARM related sanctions on Iran will be lifted and Iran can start to buy and sell weapons after 40 years.

And this trade has happened using that part of the deal which is still  going on among Iran and P+4 and UN (US exit the deal as Trump didn't find it a very logical deal while the other parties are still in the deal).",

They hoped that they can convince Iran to still respect the nuke commitments and buy time till the new administration comes to power (Biden) so they will renegotiate the deal.  \nIn the meantime, they helped Iran here and there against the willingness of Trump.  \nAfter bidden came to white house, it appeared that during the time that US was part of the deal, Iran had 3 hidden nuke sites. So it didn't respect the deal long before even trump exit the deal... So basically they were cheating as well and Trump was kind of right.  And now, Iran doesn't provide a clear answer about those 3 sites. That's why they couldn't reach into a new agreement.",

It's different than what's going on in the Arab world. The regime of Iran, is trying to show the image otherwise though. So bring back the race thing here is ridiculous. Iran was one of the most important allies of the us till 1980 and Islamic revolution... They sold Tom cats to Iran before to anybody else (even UK). The foreign and domestic policies of the Islamic regime made them a hostile state and you can see many Iranian people are even in favour of a foreign invasion to get rid of them.",

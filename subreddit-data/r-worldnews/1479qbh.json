America swooped in and essentially turned Taiwan into a colony, calling it the \"unsinkable aircraft carrier\", freezing the Chinese civil war.\n\nThousands of American soldiers were stationed in Taiwan starting in the 1950s to prevent China from finishing the civil war, and Taiwan was used as a support base by the US for the Vietnam War.\n\nThe whole bizarre \"One China\" policy is because America didn't allow the Chinese civil war to come to its natural conclusion. For decades, the US has used (and continues to use) Taiwan as the key part of its Island Chain Strategy in an attempt to contain and starve off China.\n\nDo yourself a favor and learn the history involved to understand why all of this is happening.",

By statement about young Taiwanese not seeing themselves as Chinese (that is, not of the Chinese nation-state) is indeed true *as of 2023*, regardless of how those in 1945 saw themselves.\n\nYes I know the Japanese took over Taiwan in 1895 and snatched it from the Qing. The thing is, by 1945, after years of colonization, the longstanding Taiwanese had a different identity as they were in a Japanized environment. I recall Lee Teng-hui spoke better Japanese than Mandarin.\n\nBut as for your question whether the benshengren (longstanding non-waishengren Taiwanese) in 1945 saw themselves as more Chinese or Formosan or whatever, I don't know if any party conducted a survey back then, and as the KMT's waishengren essentially took all power, that question didn't matter too much. It was around the late 80s when the waishengren lost political power, but that just accelerated Taiwan separatism *more*.\n\nEDIT: https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/publication/asia_rpt114.pdf states that Chiang's misdeeds on Taiwan ironically pushed benshengren *away* from a Chinese identity",

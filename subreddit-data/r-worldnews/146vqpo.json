Damn, won't be surprised they are explicitly there to fuck up the US UAVs above the Black Sea. For Ukraine it's a nice target: an isolated ship with no cover. But seems like russia is better prepared to fight the drones than anticipated. Perhaps it can detect the very same signals that the drones emit when they come close.\n\nIt's not a great development, but also freaking weird that the drone attacks happen in daytime, given we know they have a thermal vision for the night missions, and that Ivan Khurs used manual human-manned turret to destroy the drones.\n\nPerhaps russia hides the ships in the harbors for the night? Does anyone knows for sure?",

You could take a trench but if you didn\u2019t immediately press the attack the enemy would just dig another trench and you\u2019d have to repeat the process however if you did press the attack then you could easily be cut off the rest of your troops which would mean you would be surrounded and destroyed. The solution was to pound with artillery before and behind the advancing troops. It actually was a very good tactic given the technological limits of the war.

That is the objective of the offense more so than the actual capture of territory. If they can show some kind of gain, while concealing the heavy losses that are inevitable, it will be a strategic win for Ukraine, even if it is a tactical loss.\n\nIt\u2019s just a shame that men have to be sent to their death for *optics* and not even really operational or tactical objectives.

I know complete air superiority is an impossibility, but with f-16-s and f-18s and pac-2 batteries linked to their radar, they could have obtained temporary air dominance for strike missions, and degraded russias artillery force before this offensive. Instead, they are trying to break their way through a meat grinder. \n\nI think they can still achieve, but its going to cost them a great deal of lives and it didn't need to be this way.",

Neither side really dares approaching the frontline with their aircraft due to that. Their aircraft now are just used to lob long range missiles, which theoretically can also be done using other means.\n\nAs for artillery, it depends on where. While they have quantity in some locations, they lack the quality compared to western supplied artillery systems. So in some sectors of the front, Ukraine has an advantage in that regard.",

Saudi Arabia and the UK provided much needed support during those times.\n\nWe (US) also had the benefit of having actual air superiority by taking out many radar sites, power plants and airfields in unison. The Infamous clip of the CNN reporter talking about seeing a cruise missile fly right past him just before the transmission feed cuts out is proof of that.\n\nUkraine doesnt have that type of Air support, even with the F-16s they are to receive it wouldnt come close to the types of Air support used in the middle east.",

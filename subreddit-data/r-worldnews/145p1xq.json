Whether it would be totally global is another question since from what I read volcanoes have bigger impacts on the global climate when they are located closer to the equator. \n\nFrom what this article is saying, Campi Flegrei tops out at a VEI 7 and even though geologists believe it's possible for it to erupt at a VEI 8 they don't have any evidence that it ever has.\n\nSo if it erupts, it doesn't automatically mean it will erupt to its full potential, it could be a lot smaller. They just think it's going to erupt \"soon\" where \"soon\" on the geologic scale can be anywhere from next month to 100 years, to 1000 years from now.",

It also shares it's magma chamber with very nearby Vesuvius, which, while incredibly dangerous due to its proximity to the Naples Metro, tops out at VEI5.\n\nI hate the term Supervolcano. Mammoth Mountain is part of the Long Valley Caldera complex (in much the same way Vesuvius is part of Campi Flegrei). Long Valley is approaching melt needed for an eruption as well, but it will probably be a small rhyolitic lava dome forming eruption when it happens.",

Even if it has a minor eruption, tens of thousands, or maybe even more, will die almost immediately. Add to that the fact that, compared to Yellowstone, CF has been HIGHLY active lately, and it's really worrying. If there's an eruption anywhere in the complex, they'll have to do the best they can to evacuate Naples, and there's simply no place for the people to go quickly enough. No routes will escape becoming ensnarled in unavoidable traffic blockages, and even with a week's lead time before an eruption, they'd never be able to get all the people out, purely from a logistics standpoint. Those people are resting on a ticking time bomb.",

There have been proposals to actively cool some magmatic systems with huge amounts of geothermal energy production, but as far as I know those are more theorycrafting than actual pragmatic proposals. \n\nBut volcanoes operate on pressure; if you can reduce the pressure you can reduce the power of an eruption, in theory.",

They can use the excuse of it making them less vulnerable to potential regulation, making themselves less dependent on foreign resources (in the case of fossil fuels), being part of a new marketing campaign or adapting to new user expectations.\n\nAs long as they can make a convincing argument that it's in the best interest for the business, they can do whatever they want. Some CEO's boil \"best for the business\" down to purely profits and stock price, but they don't actually have to.\n\nThat said, there are obviously limits to what they can do, the CEO of BP obviously couldn't turn around and kill all their oil production and say it's in their best interest, but they can (and have) do things like start investing in carbon neutral technology ad that kind of thing.",

Some companies pay as little as possible for example, saying \"we need to make profit after all,\" while other companies pay more, saying \"this is more expensive, but turnover is even more expensive...  we need to make profit, after all.\" See what I mean?\n\nAlso, more profit at less cost? Sure. For *now*. Reducing our carbon footprint and waste and such means improving efficiency and inevitably becoming more profitable in the long term as a result.\n\nFor example, we are about to replace all on-site power at the Seadrift facility with SMRs, replacing the co-gen units there for our power AND steam needs. \n\nThis will save us an absolute *boatload* in emissions, while simultaneously improving the air quality, improving on-site power reliability and independence, along with some other benefits... But crucially, it will mean reliable, steady, cheap, emissions free power for decades. And that saves us money.\n\nCurrently the plan is, if it goes well, to do the same at every other major site. That will result in a HUGE reduction in our carbon output.\n\nTop it all off with the Net Zero Hydrogen Cracker in Canada that, when complete, will be both the largest ethylene cracking complex in the world AND be near zero or zero emissions ethylene to boot. If *that* does well, we plan to do the same with other large crackers.\n\nAnd these aren't small changes. They are huge changes that Cow chemical is 100% committed to (as evidenced by the literal billions we've spent already on these projects).\n\nAll I'm saying is some companies, believe it or not, look to the long term in growth. Just because something is cheaper *now* doesn't mean it'll be cheaper *then*. Hell, Putin's war has put everyone on notice regarding gas dependency, making a lot of industries realize long term changes to the grid are necessary for long term expenses to stay down.",

I\u2019m a chemical engineer by trade in chemical manufacturing for big companies for 25 years advancing through engineering and management ranks.  Last year started a new role in the corporate environmental sustainability group.  Literally every engineering project must demonstrate improved sustainability, or it will not get approved.  My team reviews them all. We made commitments to major targets and have every intention of hitting them.   We have around 100 plants around the world, and each has unique sustainability challenges.  We have spent the last 2 years going after the low hanging fruit while we establish meaningful measurement systems and baseline data.  It takes a while to do things the right way, and we have external environmental firms auditing us along the way. With the amounts of money I have seen approved and spent in the last year on sustainability only projects, I have no question on commitment.  Our road map doesn\u2019t get us to our targets yet, but we are well on our way and by the end of next year we will have a detailed climate roadmap to meet our long term commitments.  Lots of projects being identified and scoped.  I am well plugged into the industry through international trade groups, most large chemical manufacturers are at about the same place.  Have hope.  There are lots of people out there working very hard to lessen the impact of these big greedy companies.",

The clear and final answer from P&amp;G was resounding 'No'. \n\nNone of these big companies gives a shit about climate or sustainability. It is all talk so they can promote and publish propaganda where it seems like they are a green company but reality is they want absolutely nothing that can even slightly hit at their bottom line.",

The primary means by which this was done was exporting manufacturing industries to Asia. Developed nations didn't address the root cause, instead it's more like the fire was just moved somewhere else. I'm not going to pretend to know how the world economy is going to shake out in coming decades, but it is clear that developed nations have a massive overconsumption problem and until that's addressed, all the countries that manufacturing has been exported to aren't going to be following the same (illusory) decarbonization trend that developed countries have.",

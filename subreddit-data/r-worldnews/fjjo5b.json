That's also why there are a lot of people (mostly observant but not orthodox) who are against building a Third Temple (even ignoring the giant mosque where the temple would go) since it would cause changes to Judaism that many are not OK with, such as resuming the practice of sacrificing animals.\n\nI'm pretty sure any specific reference to animals or plants in the bible that isn't relevant anymore was solved by finding a similar enough plant/animal or something along these lines, not by simply ignoring the commandment.\n\nThe Jewish Law, in practice, generally sides with the Spirit of the Law, not the Letter of the Law. That's why eating milk and meat together is forbidden, for example, even though the bible technically only forbids eating an \"infant goat cooked with his mother's milk\". There are some small sects that follow the bible by word and it can result in pretty weird practices since the torah is filled with metaphors and things like that.",

Even the ice is dirty. I watched a guy repairing the drains of one of those *fancy* coke machines one time. He grabbed the hose at one end and gripped it with the other hand and slid his hand all the way down the hose. There was this literally pink sludge that fell out of it. I asked the dude what it was and he said it was actually because of all the solids in ice that don\u2019t melt away, mixing with the sugary syrup. Basically the solids in the ice being germs and other dirty things. Even though it was from the drainage, all that still mixes together inside your cup... I watched him clean all of it with my hand over my face and my eyes watering. It was gag worthy. Ever since then I try to just drink tap water honestly. It can\u2019t be any worse than what sits inside those nozzles. Also the trays where the syrup sits were full of leaked out syrup as well. So the nozzles connecting the syrup into the machine are where it all begins and those RARELY get cleaned. You just *can\u2019t* get your hand in there because the trays were so slim.",

Helicopter went on and eventually the flood waters rose higher and he drowned. \n\nHe got to heaven and asked God \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you save me? I believed in you trusted that you would.\u201d \n\nNow all you smart people out there already figured out the ending to this. \n\nAnd God said \u201cI tried, I sent a raft, a boat, and a helicopter to save you but you turned them all down.\u201d\n\nI keep hearing stories about people who say Christians shouldn\u2019t be afraid because God will protect us... that\u2019s not how this works. All churches should close. They shouldn\u2019t be exempt from this. Use common sense people.

I can't understand farsi but I understood what the crown chant after the prayers - maut al America &amp; maut al Israel. 'Maut al' equates to 'death to'. So I'm certain plenty of people - specially the old timers are in support of the regime.",

All the stupid Western sanctions are doing is making life harder for innocent Iranians and making hardliners richer and more powerful. It is time for the West to fully join the revolution of the Iranian people and stop kissing the mullahs' asses.",

The current government even brags about learning everything they know from how the Shah used to oppress their people, they just do it now under the guise of it being because of Islam. Heads of Savak were given amnesty during the revolution for training and working for the Islamic republic to help them set up their oppressive gov. People were just as angry in the 70\u2019s as they are now, Pahlavi had a poverty rate at about 60% 10 years before he was overthrown and it had just gotten worse until his demise",

Congratulations.\n\nDo brush up on basic historical fact before considering....anything else, really.\n\n&gt; but I can never get a straight answer as to just what was so terrible about Versailles.\n\nLet's put it this way: It was so terrible that even President Woodrow, head of state of one of the winning countries, thought it was excessive.\n\nSo, the commander in chief of the American military, in his great influence and  knowledge of (international) politics and history, thinks it was terrible - even though one would expect that as a victor, he would want the highest advantage.

Many of the people detained and executed by the Iranian government for these protests are also men. Men are not to blame here. The Islamic Regime is to blame. I have a huge group of Persian friends here in the states that can never return to Iran because of their outspoken beliefs. Lots of those are also guys. I\u2019m not saying the culture doesn\u2019t represent oppressed women, but that most men in Iran want freedom for their wives, sisters and daughters. They\u2019re being detained and persecuted along side them.",

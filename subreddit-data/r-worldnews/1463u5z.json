            "comment": "so like a mini fukushina tsunami washout. \n\nI read something interesting about the black sea, that the bottom isnt solid. It has something silty. hopefully it will not be like Lake Nyos in Cameroon. If the Black Sea bottom had so much trapped gases under that silt, a burp could be terrible. \n\nI recall watching a jacques cousteau documentary where a team of his divers explored this lagoon on some island with no sea life. from the surface it looked like any other lagoon but the pH levels are low. when the divers and the cameraman went down there was this layer of sand. it looked solid but when they touched it their hand went thru the sand. so they did what explorers do, they forced themselves through the bottom. enter that layer, the water was an greenish-yellow color. the divers quickly exited that zone and swam to the boat. Their eyes were burning, the color of their helmets and tanks discolored. the water they entered was acidic. another dive and they took water samples from under the soft sandy bottom. it was high in CO2 and H2S and H2SO4. They realised that over the centuries with so much vegetation, and dead aquatic life, the lagoon became uninhabitable. the heavier elements created a buffer that allowed years of sandy buildup to create a cover over this anaerobic zone.  the same for Lake Nyos, but that lake had a deeper anaerobic zone and the water pressure kept the bottom in place. it allowed the upper zone to thrive and maintain fresh water while any decaying material sank to the bottom and into that sour zone, until an earthquake cause that bottom to burp and release the concentrated CO2.",

There is only much shelf that is oxygenated in the NW (near Ukraine) and the hydrogen sulfide, no oxygen, black water burps up onto that NW shelf occasionally killing everything. More dead matter flowing into that can\u2019t be great, but it\u2019s a pretty, dang impacted water body already.",

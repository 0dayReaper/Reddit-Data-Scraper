[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1.

It\u2019s not so much that Intel messed up it\u2019s more about tsmc being a leader in the industry over Intel so Germany is far more willing to make concessions. \n\nThis is guaranteed to be expensive subsidy wise no matter who does it since tsmc will want to make a profit and Germany has higher costs in general then Taiwan and stricter labor law.",

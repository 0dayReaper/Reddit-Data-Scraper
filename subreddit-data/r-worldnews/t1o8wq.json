He's going outside to also help dispel fake news about him. Fake claims he has fled and abandoned Ukraine, or told the military to surrender (which isn't true).\n\nAn example of how powerful social media is, was shown when the Taliban took over Afghanistan. They would record themselves accepting surrenders. When it was peaceful, they would share that on social media. They would also stage surrenders to be shared as well. Having seen such videos, it helped to encourage more places to surrender. Speeding up their take over.\n\nZalensky is trying to ensure that no one in Ukraine believes he is dead or abandoned the country. As then groups may start surrendering.",

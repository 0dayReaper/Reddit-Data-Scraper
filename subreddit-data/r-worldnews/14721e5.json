It's worth noting that for all the Soviet Union's many, *many*, faults it did have a heavy focus on merit based postsecondary education. Their universities pumped out a lot of highly skilled professionals who came from poor families, with that education paid for by the state. Even non professionals could also rise fairly high in the government, the problem in those cases though is that it was because they were party members and the reason for their rise was party loyalty or patronage, not merit.",

Go to any developed nation, find the immigrants slinging street food and you'll find your fair share of eductors, artists and otherwise accomplished persons. \n\nThe myth of immigration is that all immigrants are coming from nothing for the scraps of a developed land: the truth is most sacrifice some relative comforts for the opportunities developed land will give their children. \n\nThe best programmer I ever knew spent 4 years cleaning hotel rooms until he learned just enough English to tell a recruiter he could program. He had a house, he had respect in his home country, but what he didn't have was confidence that his child would have as good a life of better.\n\nI will raise a glass to every Russian immigrant who saw the writing on the wall and got out when they could, and a finger to every Russian who took an extended vacation when the war began.",

The answer relates more to how people like Putin consolidate power than it speaks to genuinely good times. To understand the \"good times\" the best nation to look at would probably be Turkey who has followed a very similar path economically and culturally after its shitstorm of a 1990s, and has recently elected a populist dictator by way of plurality despite him running the nation into the ground. A successful populist knows how to market and who to market towards. As outsiders it looks crazy (and to many in the inside it's crazier) but so long as enough on the inside remember a worse time, they'll stand by their dictator.\n\nThe two things to know are 1: hedonic treadmill is very reall and people will find happy memories in any nader of any nation. And 2: economic strength isn't about how much money an average citizen has but how much stability they have. \n\nRussia in the 90s was unstable (a statement as obvious as saying air has oxygen). Putin's first major success was bringing stability. He wasn't subtle. He bombed his one people to do it, he legitimized criminals into seats of power, fixed corruption with extra corruption, but the end result was stability. \n\nHere's where the hedonic treadmill comes in. It's a popular assumption, in politics, that people have short memories, but this is an oversimplification. People have very long memories, but mostly for how they felt during the past. The hedonic treadmill is a principal in psychology that people have a baseline of happiness that they'll naturally return to (will 5 million euro, or lose both your legs and half your family, science on the subject suggest that within 6 months you'll be about as happy as you are right now). What this means is, under the Soviet Union, Yeltsin, or Putin Russians have been Russians living their best lives with highs, lows, and human stresses. In this context, the good times are obvious: stability. \n\nPutin brought stability to Russia. When he speaks of the Soviet Union, he talks about it as a stabilizing agent. The bad times, the times he saved Russia from, were the unstable 90s. Because people are generally living at a common threshold of happiness, populists can coast for decades on whatever good will they generate in whatever stability they brought. For many in Russia, the good times are right now, not because anything is actually better, but because even if it's worse, it's worse with stability.",

If you look at any leading universities in the world, you will find a lot of top scientists and teachers from Russia or USSR. And the brain drain is getting worse and worse every year, for the following reasons:  \n\n\n1. Spending. Russia has been consistently cutting the spending on science and education year to year for a while, which apart from low salaries doesn't offer any top-level labs for the scientists to work in\n2. Access to worldwide scientific community and conferences. With the war, it's nigh impossible for Russian scientists to travel to other places, attend conferences and participate in discussions. And science is global by nature, being isolationist doesn't work well here.\n3. Propaganda. It's slowly starting to get inserted in the curriculum, which most real scientists hate it and want to stay away from it\n4. Finally, being declared a foreign agent. This could happen for a myriad of reasons, but one of the worst consequences is that all your materials starts getting marked 18+, meaning that you can't teach school children or young university students anymore. Not to mention that it significantly hinders your attendance or participation in any local Russian scientific events.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall we are seeing the decay of the soviet science school, which was one of the top in the world, and which will probably fade away completely very soon",

That's usually the \"Soviet science school\" most of people imagine when hear about. They indeed had the most recent equipment and materials (as sophisticated as the Soviet Union could build or buy), and government spendings were enormous. Again, it was a matter of prestige, not scientific improvement (except for war-related things).\n\nThe government managed to attract quite a lot of bright younger minds and create decent conditions for old ones (specialists born in the late 19th century and in the 1900s-1920s). Together they developed their own methods of teaching and conducting experiments, using all that support and resources from the government.  \n\nHowever, the rate of major domestic breakthroughs eventually declined with many researchers opting for participating in international projects instead (1990s onward), and many subsequent domestic research based on old and obsolete stuff. The Soviet Union, effectively being a stillborn concept, started to stagnate in the 1970s (power and planned economics issues, internal uprisings, food issues etc). Money and especially project funding started to become an issue in the 1980s, and by the 1990s domestic science was the least of the young Russian Federation concerns.\n\nEdit: People also are getting old, which is natural, and younger generations for some unknown reasons didn't and don't want to struggle for 300 USD/month working full hours in their prime and getting nothing for themselves from the results, especially when they have an opportunity to work elsewhere.",

Now, autocrats love super weapons, because they can boast about how strong they are and wave them around, to compensate for their crumbling economy.  \nSo, you get the money. Now you have to make something, but super weapons are hard, and all the scientists who could actually do it have fled to Europe, so you make a \"sub-par weapon\", which works well enough to trick people in the Kremlin and the West spy agencies, and looks very scary in parades.  \nOne benefit is that if anyone tries to whistle blow on you and say that it's all a trick, they are actually the ones who will get arrested or suicided by the state.  \nNow you're laughing all the way to the bank, because the only way to find that it can't destroy a carrier group in seconds, is to try to destroy a carrier group, and nobody is that stupid are they?",

I'd like to hope no one is that stupid... but 2020 shined a concerning light on that.",

Two weeks later I joined an academic lab in Singapore on a postdoctoral contract. \n\nCompared to other jobs, early career academic research is highly mobile. There's an expectation to change institutions or even countries every few years. Labs routinely recruit people from all over the world, because very few will have relevant experience. All this helps accelerate the \"brain drain\".",

            "comment": "As an aerospace engineering undergraduate, it\u2019s tragic to see this. The Soviet Union was a juggernaut of space exploration, racing neck to neck with the United States throughout the Cold War. After the fall of the USSR, the Russian space agency, Roscosmos (\u0420\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0441) had to scale back its operations greatly, but still managed to contribute greatly to the International Space Station.\n\nIn recent years, it seemed like the Russian space program would be recovering, with missions like Luna 25 - the first Russian probe to be sent to the moon since 1976 - lined up, the Nauka module added to the space station, the Federation / Orel spacecraft to replace Soyuz underway, and Angara A5 finally launching. But, just as they were making all of that forward progress\u2026 Putin goes and ruins everything. Because of his hubris and vanity, the Russian space program is dying as many of the most talented Russian scientists and engineers are fleeing the country due to Putin\u2019s insanity. \n\nWhile I hate Putin and the commanders of the Russian military, and all of the bloodthirsty vatniks who support this brutal war, I still respect the Russians who do not support the regime, or even outright oppose it. I respect the talented intellectuals who are now forced to flee their homeland to avoid persecution or conscription into the meat grinder. It\u2019s an enormous tragedy.",

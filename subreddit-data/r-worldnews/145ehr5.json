Putin is the federal government. Where is local government? \n\nI don't think Westerners truly conceptualize the depth of corruption in places like Russia. They think it's like their corruption (every country has corruption to some extent, after all), but a little worse maybe. \n\nNot even close. It's on a whole other level. Russia's failure in Ukraine is primarily a result of endemic corruption from the ministerial level all the way to the conscript on the ground. You guys have nothing like that back home.",

Vladimir Putin, the President of the Russian Confederation does not like hearing various begging sounds from Russian citizens but he knows how to cramp down on non-obedient people. \n\nIf Putin is such a thoughtful person who can understand people's desperate voice &amp; their bad living conditions, he couldn't have committed this insane combat in the first place. Putin is the current strongman in the Russian Confederation and they should remember that. He is a dictator, not a humanist. \n\nWhat's more, he is a so busy person to maintain his regime against Ukraine's counteroffensive that he would disregard their voice.",

For a time in 1934, the Rothermere papers championed the British Union of Fascists (BUF), and were again the only major papers to do so. On 15 January 1934 the Daily Mail published a Rothermere-written editorial entitled \"Hurrah for the Blackshirts\", praising Oswald Mosley for his \"sound, commonsense, Conservative doctrine\".\n\n&gt;Rothermere visited and corresponded with Hitler on multiple occasions, such as after the 1930 elections that saw the Nazi Party dramatically increase its seats in the Reichstag, which Rothermere welcomed. In gratitude for this foreign support, Hitler granted Rothermere an exclusive interview.\n\n&gt;On another occasion, On 1 October 1938, Rothermere sent Hitler a telegram in support of Germany's invasion of the Sudetenland, and expressing the hope that \"Adolf the Great\" would become a popular figure in Britain.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Harmsworth,_1st_Viscount_Rothermere",

Later the Western world realised that the Communist rulers of the Soviet Union were just as much a threat to their way of life as the Nazis but in the 1930s and 40s were content to form military alliances with them.

The investment is supposed to grow to the size it needs to be by the time workers start drawing from it. This allows for any number of unethical actions, including claiming the investments will do better than they actually will and as a result underfunding them, or investing with too much risk and losing funds.\n\nAgain, not an expert, I welcome any corrections as this is something we should be familiar with and talking about.",

At least in the UK, valuations are required to be from independent external actuaries. With good reason - not only does it prevent fraudulent disclosures, the calculations involved are staggeringly complicated as they have to look decades into the future. Actuarial qualifications take something like seven years to obtain.\n\nDefrauding a pension scheme requires collaboration between multiple parties. Deliberately underfunding one should be picked up by any halfway competent auditor. PWC (BHS' auditors) were heavily fined and the partner heading the audit was permanently disbarred from his professional body, effectively stripped of his qualifications. Whether it was incompetence or corruption hasn't come to light.",

These companies aren\u2019t actually setting aside the appropriate amounts to cover their promises. Worst part is a lot of times an overall pay increase won\u2019t happen because of something like a good pension plan. Meanwhile the company isn\u2019t saving whatsoever for when those pensions actually get past the vesting period.  \n\nYou can go to almost any large companies financial statements and see they are often underfunding their pensions by billions of dollars. They are billions behind on promises they\u2019ve made.  FedEx made a big stink about putting like a billion towards employee retirement a little bit back, to show how they\u2019re using the trump tax cut to help people. But what they didn\u2019t tell you is that they were billions behind, so that amount they bragged about contributing was already a liability to them, they already owed it.",

In my state, NJ, years ago they reduced contribution to the public workers' pension fund and used the funds for other things with the promise to essentially pay back with increased contribution payments in the following yeara and the government has never followed through.  Our pensions are far from fully funded even as of today. \n\nI googled it just now to get a source and it's even worse than I thought. NJ is 38.4% funded as of the end of the fiscal year in June 2018.  And this year we are only contributing 70% of the recommended funded.  To put that in persective, the average state funded ratio is 72.5%. NJ is the #1 underfunded state. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nj.com/politics/2019/09/njs-public-worker-pension-system-is-the-worst-funded-in-the-nation-again.html%3foutputType=amp",

The median income in the US is $32,000. If each step on a staircase represents $100,000 of net worth then HALF of the people in the US are on the base or the very 1st step. Almost 200 million people who can't even get one step up in this system. The households on the 80th percentile are on the 5th step. That's about five seconds of walking to get up there. A billionaire is ten thousand steps up the staircase. That's enough to walk up five Empire State buildings. From these heights, they couldn't tell the difference between a millionaire and a homeless even if they wanted to. And Jeff Bezos? That's more than halfway to the space station.

Of course, we are talking about all his assets but don\u2019t forget that Jeff is selling his shares from time to time. [Sold $1B of stock in 2017]( https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/3/16604990/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-stock-sale-1-billion ) and [Cashed out $1.8B in 2019]( https://observer.com/2019/08/jeff-bezos-cash-billion-amazon-stock-fund-blue-origin/).

I know people making a little higher than that in 2020 and it's still considered by many to be average salary range.. nearly 30 years later.\n\nPeople need to start participating more in elections and our government. Theres a reason why these ultra rich people are able to influence our politics so much. That is because the general public at large does not try or their \"too busy\". Ridiculous.",

No subtlety at all...he just throws it in your face. And god forbid you mention anything positive about your own things because he's that one-up type. And man, he must own everything in the world because he always has something better than you.\n\nUnfortunately, his father recently passed away and he set up a gofundme to \"cover the enormous costs of his funeral\" or something like that. But I think everyone remembered his general attitude towards everyone and he didn't even come close to meeting the goal. Maybe they figured he could figure out how to have the best funeral ever that will be what future funerals are compared to.\n\nOr something. Fuck that guy. Sorry about his dad, though.",

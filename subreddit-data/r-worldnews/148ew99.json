[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Putin has struck zoos, hospitals, daycares, apartments and Red Cross Centers. Russia must be so proud of their brave &amp; glorious leader... A once admired &amp; respected society will now be regarded as a Rogue, Pariah State, thanks to the mini-megalomaniac, Putin!",

Pretty much just copy-pasting from Wikipedia here, but he is responsible for \n\n* ending serfdom\n* relaxation of censorship of the media\n* Judicial reform of Alexander II (google it)\n* modernization of the army and navy\n* zemstva and other innovations in local government\n* educational innovations including the expansion and reform of universities, elementary schools and secondary schools\n* reform of the Russian Orthodox Church\n* economic modernization impacting banking, railways, mining, manufacturing\n* emancipation of the peasants in Poland\n* improved the status of Jews.\n\nApparently he even approved the introduction of a reform that would've been an important first step towards a possible constitutional monarchy in Russia. Alas, he was assassinated and this planned reform was immediately abandoned. We can only imagine the potential of what might have eventually been a much more liberal and reasonable Russia had he remained in power. Seems to me like he wasn't that bad of a guy.",

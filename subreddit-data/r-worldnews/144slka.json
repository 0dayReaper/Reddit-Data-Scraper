Much of these comms will be encrypted and they won\u2019t be able to read these messages, but even public comms OTA (Over The Air) can be useful for analysis for a country that is still in the process of developing a modern military and MIC.\n\n*However* the danger is that the CCP is using a data collection strategy called: \u201c*Harvest now, decrypt later*\u201d where they try to intercept and record as much of these encrypted comms as they can in the hopes that in the future faster and better quantum computers will be able to break this encryption, so that they can go back to these files and decrypt them for analysis one day.\n\nThis is why a lot of comms nowadays are secured with 256 and 512 bit encryption, as these types of algorithms are exponentially harder to brute force with current tech due to the much larger possible number of combinations available, when compared to old 96 and 128 bit encryption. Now you can understand how important the CHIPS act is, to limit the CCP\u2019s access to quantum computers that can break this encryption had to have been an unmentioned but primary goal of this act.\n\nWhy does this all matter? \n\nIf you can decrypt enemy comms like we did in WW2 in the Pacific, you can figure out enemy intentions, which lets you do things like send your last three carriers to ambush four invading Japanese carriers and multiple fleets that were converging on an island called Midway. For those that remember history, that 1942 battle was the turning point of the war in that theatre and it came about purely due to an intelligence coup from hard working intel analysts on Oahu and their semi-crazy boss who was driving them forward.\n\nPulling off future intelligence coups is the goal of facilities such as the one being planned for Cuba. If we had normalized relations with Cuba and had bilateral trade, then this agreement likely wouldn\u2019t have happened (if initial reports are true).",

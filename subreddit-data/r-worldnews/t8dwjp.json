It was like a window into a world I will never experience. \n\nIt sounds strange, I guess,, but I found it relaxing.

He manipulated all sides of the debate, introduces crazy conspiracy theories to detract from the real ones, stole from everyone, but shared enough to keep most of the oligarchs happy to maintain power (and then ruthless used his power against all his enemies).  Worth reiterating how he rose to power:\n\n&gt; In the late 90s, Putin ran the FSB (the renamed KGB after USSR broke up) and president Yeltsin was enmeshed in corruption scandals. Mid-August 1999, Yeltsin appointed Putin, a political unknown as prime minister (basically second in command). Less than a month later, Russia was terrorized by a series of apartment building bombings, where residential buildings were lined with explosives and blown up in the middle of the night killing hundreds. This was blamed on Chechen terrorists and a war with Chechnya was started that Russia quickly won.  Midway though the war Yeltsin resigned and Putin became acting president. Putin negotiated a peace with Chechnya letting the strongest warlord have complete control of the region as long as he was loyal to Putin's government.  Putin then accelerated the elections and won the presidency.\n\n&gt; However, the villainy is that the Russian apartment bombings were orchestrated by the FSB and the Russian government. Two Russian FSB agents were caught by police putting lining an apartment building with live explosives. They weren't punished for this. After the second bombing on Sept 13th 1999, the speaker of the Duma talked about the tragic apartment bombing in Volgodonsk (population ~170k) last night. However the first two bombings were both in Moscow (population of 10 million). On Sept 16th, three days later there was an apartment bombed in Volgodonsk.\n\n&gt; An ex-FSB agent, Alexander Litvinenko, defected to the UK and wrote books about how Putin's government is to blame for the Russian apartment bombings. He was murdered with Polonium a murder that international courts have found to have been ordered by Russia.\n\nPutin also successfully increased polarization and radicalization in the west to weaken Europe and the US on a variety of issues.  The US intelligence report on Russian meddling in 2016 and 2020 didn't just find Russia actively supporting Trump, NRA, and Republicans, they also actively supported *radical* black lives matters, fringe green party, ACAB, etc.  Whatever they can do to divide everyone into ultra-polarized groups that will in-fight.  (You can argue some of the left-wing support was just to reduce Democrats from voting).\n\nhttps://www.thisamericanlife.org/763/the-other-mr-president\n\nGranted, Putin isn't a particularly smart man, he's just audacious.   Right now it looks like he seriously miscalculated (possibly after only surrounding himself with yes men) and stupidly got involved too deep in an unpopular war of aggression that he can't justify or win, while sanctions will cripple his country which will lead to his downfall.",

The Second Chechen War, [Elena Bonner\u2019s analysis from 1999](https://reliefweb.int/report/russian-federation/second-chechen-war) is one of the best contemporary explanations. \n\nPutin endeared himself with the General Staff, since he took on the responsibility for that war, something Soviet leaders normally had not done, they would claim the laurels of victory and shift the blame for defeats onto the military - something Putin seemingly is doing now. He\u2019s off his playbook, but the overall concept of war to shore up support has been with him since his very first year as a PM.\n\nEdit: Fixed the author name.",

If you look at documentaries before the war started, they support him wholeheartedly and buy what he\u2019s selling. It\u2019s quite sad. But there does seem to be a lot more pushback on that recently, and stuff like going into another country on a \u201cpeacekeeping mission\u201d, which is really hard to actually reason, and this will strike a hard blow.",

Those kinds of people will NEVER change their view because it would mean they were wrong in the first place, and that would be devastating to the ego (same as Kaputin here). The survival strategy is that it is much easier to accept the alternate reality.\nThis might change an opinion here and there but, unfortunately, for the most part this is just a feel-good hack for us. Either enough people stand up to Putin as is (and we still sanction them to some extent with a warning- don't keep leaders like this in power), we placate him somehow so that he can save face, or he takes it too far",

I heard a [program](https://onbeing.org/programs/trabian-shorters-a-cognitive-skill-to-magnify-humanity/) on NPR not too long ago where the guest, Trabian Shorters, shared a similar view.\n\nThe whole program is worth listening to (deals mostly with race and ways to mitigate bias), but this is the salient part:\n\n&gt; Tippett: I do get a sense that the hacker in you has a lot of confidence that this is a shift \u2014 I\u2019ve heard you say it, that we can flip the script in a short period of time and that new generations actually do have the capacity right now to change this narrative at scale.\n&gt; \n&gt; Shorters: Well, let me maybe contextualize that a little bit. The baby boom generation, the civil rights generation, those folks have been adults for 50 years. Everything about our sense of policy and priorities, everything about our culture, has flowed through one generation for half a century. And they\u2019re aging out of institutional power. So as we experience that instability, the other thing that\u2019s going on simultaneously is the most diverse generation that we\u2019ve ever had is becoming the mainstream. And that is why they\u2019re going to fundamentally challenge whatever existing narratives around what a gender is, what women\u2019s roles are, who is Black or white or whatever \u2014 even the way we think about race \u2014 how fluid those definitions \u2014 they\u2019re going to challenge all that, because it doesn\u2019t fit their experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; So this is it. [laughs] This is the last time that one racial group can carry the majority of this democracy. And in that type of democracy \u2014 when you have racial pluralism, where there is no majority \u2014 then the skills to be able to see each other\u2019s value becomes a functional skill. It\u2019s not a nice one to have; it\u2019s the only way to govern.\n\nI found it incredibly uplifting.",

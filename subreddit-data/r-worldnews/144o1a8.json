Did he tell you that the border guard was needed to be dispatched in order to quell their little rebellion?\n\nNo?\n\nI remember exactly what happened in Lod and Ramla in 2021, the entire country remember. The Palestinians are too very proud about their success, they still circlejerck non-stop about how they managed to rally Israeli Arabs to join the war. So let's not get confused about who attacked who.\n\nAnd just so it will be clear - I don't condone the retaliatory strikes that followed.

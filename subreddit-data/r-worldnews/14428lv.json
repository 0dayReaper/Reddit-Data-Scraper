While true, it's important to recognize who's pulling the cart and who has the whip. \n\nThese corporations would make nothing without people's collective effort. Yet they determine the environmental and economic course for those people and the planet. They use individual responsibility to deflect from organized butchering of the planet and subjugation of workers. \"Get involved\" for most people equates to a slap in the face of daunting power, money and organization. And this is intentional. As I said in another reply - the more people living paycheck to paycheck the fewer people are available to protest and/or truly engage in our quasi-democracy. A single person does not stand a chance against billions in marketing/propaganda and a bought government UNLESS we harness stronger collective action and wield it on governments and businesses who are literally keeping us in poverty and sacrificing our future for their profits.",

Everybody - including corporations - has a role to play in the solution, we can't just point at others and make no changes in our own lives. We need to change everything. \n\nPeople, not corporations, elect politicians, and politicians set policy. But politicians in favour of the Green New Deal, carbon taxes, cutting subsidies for oil and meat - even phasing out gas stoves - can't get elected these days.\n\nI've been taking this seriously since the early 90s. I haven't eaten meat in 30 years. I live in a small townhouse walking distance to work, and my wife and I have one small car we share. We eat local and organic good when it's available. We also stopped at one child (for various reasons including the environment, though mostly because our chances of having twins were really high given her family's genetics). We fly seldom, and when we do we buy offsets. Overall, our carbon output is far lower than others. Meanwhile we have neighbors that have huge trucks they don't really need, that have two or three vehicles, that eat meat with every meal, that recreate with dirt bikes and snowmobiles, that fly and take cruises every year, that drive their kids to school instead of making them take the school bus, etc. Their way of life is unsustainable.\n\nThe point is that if everybody cut back a little and made a few adjustments to their lives then we would be in a lot better shape as a country.",

In a near future, the air pollution is so bad that everyone wears gas masks. The infant mortality rate is soaring, and birth defects, new diseases, and physical ailments of all kinds abound. The water is undrinkable\u2014unless you\u2019re poor and have no choice. Large corporations fighting over profits from gas masks, drinking water, and clean food tower over an ineffectual, corrupt government. Environmentalist Austin Train is on the run. The \u201ctrainites,\u201d a group of violent environmental activists, want him to lead their movement; the government wants him dead; and the media demands amusement. But Train just wants to survive. More than a novel of science fiction, The Sheep Look Up is a skillful and frightening political and social commentary that takes its place next to other remarkable works of dystopian literature, such as Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World, Ray Bradbury\u2019s Fahrenheit 451, and George Orwell\u2019s 1984.!&lt;\n\n*I'm a bot, built by your friendly reddit developers at* /r/ProgrammingPals.  *You can summon me with certain* [commands](https://www.reddit.com/user/BookFinderBot/comments/13z7slk/bookfinderbot_commands/). *Or find me as a browser extension on* [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/book-finder/jajeidpjifdpppjofijoffbcndlpoedd?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social_media&amp;utm_campaign=comments). *Opt-out of replies* [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/BookFinderBot/comments/141txsm/bookfinderbot_optout/). *If I have made a mistake, accept my apology.*",

Nevertheless, she notes that processed meat products \"are processed foods\" that should be consumed in moderation, aiming for one serving per week or less.\"](https://health.usnews.com/conditions/cancer/articles/worst-cancer-causing-foods)\n\nHow we can you take you seriously if you don't even read articles behind your own claims? \n\nRed meat only elevates risk if you cook it at boiling temperature (tatar and sushi type servings that don't relies on high temperature are perfectly fine), while preserved meat is well... packed with chemicals like most of preserved food, no surprise here. This also doesn't applies to fat which is even used to slow down cancer development",

For the meat, I don't need it all day every day, but more than once in a blue moon. Otherwise I get iron-deficient and practically narcoleptic, and can't retain muscle mass (I'm a woman and have trouble with that already). My ancestors are mostly Northern European, adapted to herding livestock, eating meat and dairy. I'm not willing to completely gut my health to try and realign my fundamental constitution. \n\nYes I tried to be a vegetarian and it just made me weak(er). I don't think it's JUST a matter of getting enough pure iron, it's a complex nutritional issue. You can go suffer and be self-righteous about it. I'm waiting for readily available lab-grown beef to be a thing.",

These fires were going to happen at some point, climate change only adds to the problem. We stopped the fires because it saved economically valuable lumber, and potentially private property, when we should have been letting more territory burn to clear the fuel.",

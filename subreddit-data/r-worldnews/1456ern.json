After the initial invasion failed everything Russia has done has been to either kill or scare as many Ukrainians into fleeing the country as possible.\n\nIf russia cant have ukraine itself, Russia wants Ukrainian territory to have as little Ukrainians as possible. Essentially genocide.\n\nThe whole \"we are brothers\" is for domestic consumption in russia",

At least several square miles along a southern stretch of the Dnipro river, lined by industry and farmland, have been inundated by floodwater that's swirling with debris, fuel and other contaminants.\n\nUkraine accused Russia of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka hydro-power plant and dam \"from inside\" early Tuesday morning, unleashing a torrent of water from the massive reservoir it held back onto the surrounding Kherson region.\n\nThe city of Kherson is less than 50 miles downstream from the broken dam. Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said Friday in a social media post that four people were confirmed dead and at least 13 more were missing amid the flooding. He said some 2,412 people had been evacuated. A Russian official in the region put the death toll at eight.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging app that \"hundreds of thousands of people\" in towns and villages along the flooded Dnipro were struggling to find fresh drinking water.\n\n**Read more:** https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-kherson-flooding-kakhovka-dam-shelling-front-line-latest/",

If the water wasn't that deep, it could still do some damage, albeit limited. But I'd bet they're firing actual air burst shells considering the water.",

US citizens are rarely able to look at facts from a non westernized view , and this not your personal fault, it's your country's agenda , so I wrote about what I know from the history of Taiwan from a Latino and a offensive realist side .\n\n I am aware that the KMT is not in power anymore , it took only 50 years for it to happen , but as the citation I made on other response shows ,there's still a lot of problems in Taiwan. I can't see a point made supporting the idea that a country's history doesn't leaves marks that take a long time to be over them. Here we a had a military dictatorship for about 25 years ,half the length of the duration of the KMT regime , and still there's a lot of problems because of it . Last election we had Bolsonaro supporters camping in front of military bases BEGGING for them to overthrow democracy and take the power again. And sure it wasn't as bad as KMT's regime ,but it still was a bloody , oppressive , fascist regime, that made people dissappear so well that not even the body has been found to this day. And still , almost half of the population thinks that the military going back to power is a good idea .\n\nI made this point to say that yes ,there's a new government now ,but the impact of the KMT regime sure also left marks not only in Taiwanese government ,but also in their citizens, specially because it has been only 23 years from the first political party in their history. Since the end of the dictatorship, in 1989, went through two impeached presidents , two terms of a neoliberal president , three terms of a metallurgist in power , 14 years with the left in power, our first female president served  two terms, a fascist president in Bolsonaro ,ans even with all these transitions, we are not over the impact of the military coup (backed and aided directly by the US btw )",

The Taiwanese originally welcomed the new Chinese immigrants with open arms. But Chiang Kai Shek and the KMT were dictatorial and slaughtered Taiwanese intellectuals and enacted martial law trying to suppress, terrorize, and control the Taiwanese population. The Taiwanese suffered a lot at the hands of the China\u2019s KMT, but Taiwan eventually and peacefully transitioned into a mature democracy (no violent revolution required, which tells you a lot about the Taiwanese). But it shows why the Taiwanese are very wary of China and why their values align more with the West rather than dictatorial Chinese government.\n\nETA: Given Taiwan\u2019s small size, it\u2019s history with China is often overlooked by many. So I appreciate you setting up this opportunity for to bring a little more color to this part of Taiwan\u2019s traumatic past and address the misleading parts in your narrative.",

So if they want to be it's own country , they shall be, fuck Chinese interests in this case.\n\nIf you have ,I would like to read your sources on the statement that the KMT, specially Chiang Kai Shek who really hated China and was astoundingly conservative ,were controlled by the Chinese . From what I've studied ,very scarce research I admit , Taiwan was heavily influenced by the Japanese in that time . But since I' have little knowledge about Taiwanese history ,I would change my mind on this if shown material proof.\n\nLast ,yes China is a dictatorial regime ,but it is a worker's dictatorship. As a marxist ,I view the US ,UK and almost any western country as a dictatorship , but a bourgeoisie's dictatorship. One benefits a small fraction of the population ,and rule in favour to their own interests\nUsing my county as an example ,why do you think we haven't stopped the destruction of the Amazon forest yet? Because the people in power HAVE to do policies that favour the soy planters oligarchy  to stay in power\nWhere's the democracy in here ? I voted for a supposed leftist president last year and since he has been in power he only conceded to the richest people demands .",

This island is Taiwan.\n\nThough it was a dictatorship at first, Taiwan was able to became a democracy and enjoyed economic prosperity. As such, it presents a \"what could have been\" China which is difficult for the CCP to tolerate.\n\nBeside, the CCP never got over their their inability to conquer the island in 1950 and though Tawain never was part of the People's republic, they claim it's their because it was part of Imperial China.",

Maybe some do, but in order to get elected they can't really say so, so they kinda just dance around the topic while reaffirming that they see themselves as Taiwanese first. The constitution is what says they do, and Taiwan doesn't amend it because if they did, China would get mad. \n\n&gt;It'd sure be nice if they could just sit down and agree that they don't want any part of governing the other and want to live just as neighbours.

Taiwan is a strategically vital island for China, it's just off their coast with easy access to one of the world's busiest trade routes (the one to Japan and South Korea), and it is the only coastline that China has any claim over which can enable them access to the Pacific Ocean and a blue water navy.",

The people of Taiwan and the PRC are both Chinese, and to your question they have a shared history, culture, language, everything. \n\nThe other important piece of the conversation is that the Chinese President and dictator Xi Jingping has been advocating a political ideology in which the Chinese Communist Party is the only entity that can and should govern Chinese people, and he doesn't necessarily care about national borders.

America ended up with a European language called English. Taiwan ended mostly with a Chinese language called Minnan, aka Taiwanese.\n\nIn 1895 (before Cuba was separated from Spain) Taiwan was ceded to Japan by the Qing Empire. Japan wasn\u2019t a perfect ruler but they did bring prosperity, rule of law, infrastructure, and education to Taiwan.\n\n At the end of WWII (1945) Taiwan was handed over to the Chinese Nationalist (KMT) party government of China (officially Republic of China (ROC)). At this point in time the Taiwanese mostly identified as Chinese, although a Taiwanese identity was also growing and there also quite a few people who identified as Japanese. \n\nThe KMT quickly lost a civil war they had been fighting with the communist (CCP) party. The CCP declared their new government the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949.\n\nThe KMT in Taiwan were brutal to the Taiwanese. They tore up the infrastructure to send to the other side of the strait. They suppressed the local culture and forced people to learn a new language. They introduced widespread corruption. In 1947 the 228 massacres occurred and some 20,000 people, including much of the cultural, business and political elite, were killed. The KMT in Taiwan continued to insist that they were the legitimate government of all of China. They put martial law in place that suppressed political rights and resulted in many Taiwanese being imprisoned or killed. \n\nThe KMT and CCP hated each other and had limited contact, but one thing they agreed on was that Taiwan was part of China, the opinions of the Taiwanese people be damned. What the Taiwanese thought of this is not well known because freedom of speech was not respected by the KMT.\n\nIn the 1990s Taiwan became a democracy with human rights and such. It soon became clear that Taiwanese weren\u2019t really on board with the KMT\u2019s Chinese Nationalism.  In the decades since becoming democratic, Taiwanese have identified less and less as \u201cChinese\u201d and more and more as \u201cTaiwanese\u201d.\n\nThe CCP however maintains its position that Taiwan is part of China.",

                    "comment": "Depends on who you ask honestly. Here's my guess at the order:\n\n1. France v. Germany (some shared history, but pretty separate)\n2. Ukraine v. Russia (similar culture, shared history,)\n3. US v. Britain (former territory)\n4. US confederacy v. US (essentially same country but divided by conflict)\n\nBack before the 80's or so, you'd probably switch 3 and 4 around, but the further into the future we get (based on current trends at least) the more cemented 3&gt;4 becomes.\n\nTo put it briefly (EDIT turns out this wasn't brief at all lmfao my apologies for the wall of text, I tried to make it brief but there's just too much I felt should be included in the writeup), it was an island off the coast of China populated by native Austronesian Taiwanese for pretty much forever, until the 1600s when some Chinese people started migrating onto the island. In the mid-1600s, the Dutch came and set up a trading post there to trade with China and Japan. This didn't change the status quo too much but there was some resistance from the local Taiwanese and Chinese residents. Despite this, the Dutch were successful for a short while.\n\nHowever, this was also the period in which the Ming dynasty of China were overthrown by the nascent Qing dynasty. Ming loyalists fled to Taiwan in the late 1600s, kicked out the Dutch and established the Kingdom of Tungning there, a political entity opposed to the Qing and seeking to restore the Ming to their old position. To quell these dissidents, the Qing dynasty invaded and annexed Taiwan into Qing territory which was the first time the island was officially joined into a political union with mainland China.\n\nFor a long time, Taiwan was treated more or less as a frontier territory and wasn't too important to the Qing. The main effect of the addition of Taiwan into China was a big influx of Chinese migration which pushed the indigenous people off the fertile lowlands and into the mountainous areas of the island.\n\nFast forward about two hundred years, we're in the late 1800s now and China is being weakened by the encroachment of imperialist powers. The most relevant point here is China losing the first Sino-Japanese war and being forced to cede Taiwan to Japan. Japan takes control and despite attempts from some of the loyalist Chinese locals to resist. The Qing at this point weren't too interested in Taiwan and had bigger priorities so they didn't do much to support the loyalists on the island, thus Taiwan is now officially Japanese territory. Locals are made to speak Japanese and swear allegiance to the Japanese emperor. Operations on the island were chiefly run by the Imperial Japanese Navy and the goal was to turn it into a \"model colony.\" To this end, the Japanese built up a lot of infrastructure on the island, including building Taiwan's first university. Meanwhile on the mainland, the imperial Qing dynasty is overthrown and replaced by a shaky Republic of China led by the Chinese nationalist party (KMT) which would soon collapse into competing warlord factions. The KMT formed one such faction and through alliances and conquest, regained nominal control over much of the country. Japan then invades China and does lots of brutal war crimes, too many to list and not really relevant to Taiwan so I won't go into it but just know that it was really bad. The KMT and their then-rivals the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) formed an alliance against Japan, and would spend the rest of the war simultaneously fighting with and against one another, against Japan and for control over China.\n\nAfter WW2, the Japanese were forced to hand sovereignty of Taiwan over to the allies, who in turn put it under the control of China's KMT (nationalist) government, then led by Chiang Kai-Shek, leader of the KMT who was also the recognized leader of China at the time. Shortly thereafter, the Chinese civil war between the nationalists and communists flared up again. The communists won, and in a reflection of the previous Ming/Qing transition period, the nationalists fled to Taiwan to establish a government-in-exile. This government has continued to operate to this day, and is the one currently running the island. Meanwhile on the mainland, the communists established the other Chinese government, the Peoples' Republic of China.\n\nBefore talking about the differences between the nationalists in Taiwan and the communists on the mainland during the period following the establishment of the ROC in Taiwan, I'd like to rewind a bit and talk about some context. From the beginning of the re-establishment of Chinese rule over Taiwan following WW2, the economy was functionally run under a fascist military-first doctrine. Resources were centralized and geared towards plans to fight the communists on the mainland. Corruption was rampant, there was runaway inflation, private property was sometimes arbitrarily seized, and many Taiwanese-born Chinese were kept out of high positions in government in favor of people from the mainland. Similar to how it was under the Japanese colonial period, local Taiwanese Han people were made to learn and speak Mandarin (before this period, most Taiwanese Chinese spoke a Taiwanese flavor of a different Chinese dialect, Hakka). All of this caused widespread discontent at the new Chinese administration which culminated in the 223 incident on February 28th, 1947 when a KMT officer fired shots into a crowd of angry Taiwanese locals and incited an anti-government uprising on the island. The governor of the island called for reinforcements from the mainland and the uprising was violently suppressed, leading to the deaths of thousands of locals.\n\nNow, back to 1949 and the conclusion of fighting in the Chinese civil war. Mainland China under the communists would spend the next few decades doing famines and cultural revolutions as part of possibly the largest (and most mismanaged) social experiments with the aim of achieving rapid industrialization and self-sufficient communism. Meanwhile nationalist China on Taiwan set about establishing martial law over the island. This post-war period of military rule is known as the white terror, a time of brutal authoritarianism where the activities of locals were strictly controlled, and punishments for perceived actions against the state were numerous and harsh. PRC did make a few attempts at gaining control over Taiwan during this time, but weren't successful.\n\nIn 1975, Chiang Kai-Shek died and was replaced by his son. This generally led to a relaxation in military rule (though not abolishment) and about a decade later, Taiwan transitioned from a military dictatorship to a democracy and has remained as such since then. Today, the culture on Taiwan, while retaining a lot of its Chinese (or more specifically, largely Fukienese) roots, is distinct from that of China in many ways. The island's identity is as a former colony that won its own independence and democracy. and both the Japanese and mainland Chinese are commonly seen as colonizers (with some Taiwanese even preferring the period of Japanese rule, but that's a dicey subject so I won't touch it). Taiwan generally maintains strong democratic values as well as generally trustworthy institutions with high voter turnout for elections. To my understanding, efforts are now being made to better represent indigenous non-Han Taiwanese people politically as well. This is contrasted with the mainland, where ethnic minorities tend to be oppressed when their interests conflict with the state's. A brief pro-Democracy movement in the 80's was violently suppressed by the government in the now-infamous Tiananmen Square Massacre and since then political engagement and pro-democracy sentiment has dwindled.\n\nIn the interest of fairness, I will also add here that to the CCP and many mainlanders, Taiwan is seen as an inseparable part of China ripped from it by colonialism and foreign powers, and the notion that the Chinese people must be united is quite strong. This is a sentiment that is decidedly not shared by most Taiwanese people however, so a reunification of Taiwan with the mainland is highly unlikely outside of a military scenario. Legally speaking, Taiwan's status is special. The UN recognizes the PRC as the sole \"government of China\" so Taiwan doesn't really get to officially participate in UN talks. Many of the world's governments give official recognition to the PRC while maintaining unofficial ties with Taiwan (ROC). Taiwan continues to operate with a government distinct from the mainland one, with its own currency, passport and military, so in effect Taiwan is a country in all but name.\n\nMy aim here was to present the facts in a more-or-less unbiased way, and to specifically underline the modern attitude that Taiwanese people generally have toward the mainland and where it originates from. Full disclosure: I'm not Taiwanese and actually have roots in the mainland, so feel free to correct any of this if it's biased or inaccurate.",

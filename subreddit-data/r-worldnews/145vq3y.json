Russia as a state, putin and many more Russian officials have committed this crime.\n\nUntil now the ICC has charged putin and a few others for their forceful deportations, as it is the easiest to prove. But the icc will go on and find the prove needed to convict putin of the crime of aggression, that is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole (as said by judge Robert Wright).\n\nIt is only a matter of time to find the proof necessary (that undoubtedly exists) to try putin and his cronies for the crime of aggression, it won\u2019t be too long. But there are many more guilty of war crimes and deserving of justice.\n\nAnd if it is only in 50 years that one can prove that some specific soldier pulled the trigger killing an innocent civilian in Bucha or aimed a missile at a maternity ward in Mariupol, he will be tried and justly sanctioned then.\n\nJustice has a long breath, no Russian that committed a war crime can ever again step foot on soil of a free state, as he must fear to be arrested and tried even in old age.",

I get that then I'm happy.

I have this idea that it was the show THE APPRENTICE that made him the god emporer of stupid people, who else watches network cable?

Generally the people that support trump are the least powerful people in our society ( blue collar people in the middle of the country without secondary education).\n\nHe represents to them, everything they want to be, because he acts just like they do (or would if they could), and gets away with it.\n\nHe is the champion of the walmart crowd.\n\nI think at this point we need to throw away the entire federal government away and start over.\n\nThere is a joke by joe rogan, something like \" If Jefferson came back, he would freak out. \"Thats all you guys changed!?

There's no way to compare how many more civilians died to drone killings vs the many raids conducted by human soldiers and fighter pilots, both US and Iraqi.  A whole hospital filled with people was bombed by a manned fighter jet in 2015.  Drone killing likely didn't change how many civilians were killed.  That being said, Trump killed more people with drone attacks in 3 years than Obama did in 8, and then decided to stop releasing any count of bodies, undoing all the transparency that Obama forced onto the military.  Bush never even bothered to keep count. \n\n&gt;bills which have said dangerous precedents.\n\nLiterally nothing to do with Obama or democrats.  The only major bills they pushed through were in his first two years in office, and unless you hate giving healthcare to poor people or the dodd frank wallstreet reform bill, chances are you don't actually know what you dislike about him.",

From the kansas bomb plot to kill somali imigrants in 2016, to Charlottesville, to the MAGA bomber. There are a plethora of examples of trumpers following \"Durr Fuhrer's\" call to action. Our president is a stochastic terrorist.\n\nHe is a wannabee authoritarian. He has been stacking the courts, breaking laws left and right with 0 consequences. He has been \"joking\" about being president for life. He has been stoking violence during the covid protests calling on \"second ammendment people\" to \"liberate\" their states, and now during the Floyd George protests calling for more violence \"when the looting starts, the shootong starts\"\n\nThis shit aint normal.

They also funnel mafia money into British political parties, in order to gain influence on parliamentary research roles, using a bunch of shell companies and hire a bunch of PR firms to make the whole operation look squeaky clean.\n\nKeep in mind that the Conservative Party has been donated to by Russian oligarchs before; Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser and some would say the real Prime Minister, spent a period of time in Russia in the 1990s; the person who wrote the Conservative Party\u2019s 2019 manifesto is a former member of the Revolutionary Communist Party (whose members have all gone on to found far-right news blogs or become founding members of the Brexit Party - another party that is 100% swimming in Russian money); Boris Johnson himself is also friends with at least one London-based Russian oligarch, who owns The Independent (a newspaper that, since said oligarch took over, no longer has any political leanings and exists purely to stir shit up). It makes sense that the Russia Report was sat on the PM\u2019s desk on the morning before the vote to trigger an election, and still remains unpublished.",

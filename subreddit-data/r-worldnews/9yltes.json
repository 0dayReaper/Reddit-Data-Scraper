It was natural to seek relations with the USSR, although those were not really trustful as the USSR had ambitions to get to the Indian Ocean and one option was to conquer and annex Iran.\n\nThe USA had traditionally strong economic ties to the KSA, not because it needed its oil but because it is one of the co-owners of the Saudi oil production. The cooperation with NATO though is an outcome of the 2nd Gulf War, where Saudi asked the USA to help with the liberation of Kuwait and had nothing to do with the USSR or Iran.\n\nThe enmity between KSA and Iran though is because they are both regional superpowers, theocratic, and the stronghold of the two major confessions within Islam.",

Democratically elected leaders decide to nationalize resources being used by foreign companies and get assassinated or overthrown for it, then the US \"steps in\" and sees to it that a guy with the companies interests gets control. Usually by using coups. Then when the people finally start getting back control, Westerners ask \"why is this country so shitty?\" Well, it's partially because most of the money went to a dictator and some of the resources went to foreign companies that disregard human life and suffering.",

Let them buy their bombs from shitty dealers selling duds and lemons. \n\nI know nothing of daily life for the average Saudi Arabian, but I imagine it would be better if the Wahhabists would fuck off and let the Arabian peninsula free to pursue any religious belief. Wahhabism, and Saudi Arabia, are behind most of the Islamism and Jihadist doctrines responsible for terrorism and the subsequent demonizing of the Muslim world.\n\nI wish all countries could band together and stop buying Saudi oil, and stop selling the Saudis guns and bombs.",

They've got a lot of money and for the moment they have a great deal of political power in the world (from the money itself and from the oil) so they want to trade some of that in for a military because that might make them relevant in the area even after the oil and the money run dry. They are also concerned about insurrection or rebellion of course but the types of toys they've been buying lately are more about wanting to sit at the big-boys' table. If they could wrangle some nukes, they'd be all over that!\n\nI doubt it'll work though in the end. No one is going to shed a tear for the Saudis when it all falls apart.",

I'd suspect that in the event of economic collapse, the richest ones will simply flee the country with their riches stashed away in foreign bank accounts well beforehand. Why do you think so many rich Saudis have bought London houses? Because they're tangible assets, essentially brick bank accounts which will still be there even if things go tits up. \n\nMeanwhile it's the teachers, bus drivers and road sweepers who live out ordinary lives there without access to that oil money who'll suffer- jobs will likely be lost, wages will crash whilst living costs go up and things like food or clothes become massively more expensive, assuming they can be found.

I only made the Belgium reference because of its historic roots to industries in Zaire area. Chins herself has large subsidized EV market - but they just burn coal to power their EV's thus cancelling out any benefits.

He took it as a personal possession (separately from Belgium), the Congo Free State. He then let regional governors accountable only to him do whatever was necessary to extract rubber wealth from the jungle. Half the population died as they were worked to death and mutilated by amputation as punishment for missing quotas. So something like 5-10 million, all before WW1 even. Press was strictly kept out. Only fake happy stories were allowed out.\n\nThis horror was kept under wraps until a few brave journalists broke in to expose it, though I don\u2019t think they were believed at first. And I believe this whole episode is still excluded from Belgian public school history. (Edit: It\u2019s actually not, see replies below)\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State\n\nEdit: fixed death toll\n\nMore important edit: the thing I read about it not being in Belgian schools is clearly untrue to as people have commented below!",

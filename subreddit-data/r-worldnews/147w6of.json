[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

With satellites, it\u2019s impossible to have large scale, unobserved naval maneuvers. \n\nIt just makes sense to have your Pacific fleets doing drills close to where they are most likely to see action. And it also sends the message that we are prepared to defend our friends and interests in the region, no matter how much the Chinese may object.",

The idea that China has existed continuously as a distinct entity is just CCP propaganda. It's like saying that Turkey and the Ottoman Empire are the same thing. Or like saying that the USA is still Britain.\n\nThe PRC has only existed since 1949, that's when it was founded. The US has existed since 1776. Before that, they were the RoC and the British Empire respectively. And the RoC had existed for about 35 years, before that it was the Qing Dynasty's empire. When an empire is overthrown and a new government installed, we consider that a new nation.",

[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Our timeline keeps adjusting backwards for when and how life began on our planet. That\u2019s fairly thrilling! \n\nReminds me of when I learned dinosaurs had feathers and are closely related to modern birds. I was a grownup, and that is the opposite of the reptilian scaled monsters they taught when I was a kid. Legit blew my mind to learn my knowledge base had outdated information. \n\nNow, I love it!! Such an interesting time to be alive.",

My sentence structure was all messed up.\n\nIt was Homo naledi (identified in 2013).\n\nThe new discovery was that they buried their dead and made petroglyphs. The new discovery altered our understanding of their abilities and timeline. \n\n\u201cA team of explorers has uncovered evidence that Homo naledi buried their dead and carved symbols on cave walls at least 100,000 years before modern humans.\n. . . \n\nOn the walls above the burials, the team also spotted symbols deeply engraved in the hard rock, showcasing crosses, hashtag-like symbols and other geometric shapes.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time such meaningful behaviors have been observed in a nonhuman species. H. naledi had a brain about one-third the size of a human\u2019s, causing scientists to question whether Homo sapiens are truly exceptional for having such big brains.\u201d\n\nhttps://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/06/10/world/homo-naledi-science-newsletter-wt-scn/index.html",

Apparently, the author does have formal papers already undergoing review.  The second reason it\u2019s considered controversial is because the hypothesis requires careful testing and dating of the materials.  The third reason is because when the author announced their findings suggesting the funerary practices, the scientific community did not entirely accept it, likely because of the first two reasons I mentioned.  The author claims that they will have their answers in the next three years.  Science takes a long time, which is why science by press release is controversial.  It just doesn\u2019t fit nicely into the quick narrative of the news cycle.",

This may be confusing to people but...\n\n\nAll dinosaurs are reptiles, but not all reptiles are dinosaurs. All birds are dinosaurs but not all dinosaurs are birds. Thus, all birds are reptiles but not all reptiles are birds.\n\n\nRelevant Wiki:\n\n&gt; In the traditional Linnaean classification system, birds are considered a separate class to reptiles. However, crocodilians are more closely related to birds than they are to other living reptiles, and so modern cladistic classification systems include birds within Reptilia, redefining the term as a clade. Other cladistic definitions abandon the term reptile altogether in favor of the clade Sauropsida, which refers to all amniotes more closely related to modern reptiles than to mammals. \n\n\nFrom USBC.edu\n\n&gt; \nAre birds reptiles?\nAnswer 1:\nTechnically, birds are indeed reptiles. Birds descended from the very first reptile. Birds are also dinosaurs because they descended from a dinosaur. This can all be a little confusing. Paleontologists (people who study all the different animals that have ever lived on Earth) call T Rex and others like him \"non-avian dinosaurs\" or \"non-bird dinosaurs\" because technically, if you say just the word dinosaur, you are including birds.\n\nBerkeley.edu \n&gt; Ask your average paleontologist who is familiar with the phylogeny of vertebrates and they will probably tell you that yes, birds (avians) are dinosaurs. Using proper terminology, birds are avian dinosaurs; other dinosaurs are non-avian dinosaurs, and (strange as it may sound) birds are technically considered reptiles\n\nComes down to if you like classification systems from the 1700s or modern ones informed by 300 additional years of research.",

Over 300 active historians during the era, but we can only reference the one that is a documented forgery.  Oh.  I'm sorry.  It was 'interpreted by a Christan' at some later point.  The other reference has the dead coming back to life in Matthew 27:53.  You'd think that would have been an interesting day from a historian's point of view.  Somebody would have noted that and written it down.  \"Hey, Charlie had a great harvest and the dead came out of their tombs today, so that was interesting.\"",

Oxford was a Christian school.  Many people that made some the most profound scientific discoveries were religious clergymen or monks.  Gregor Johan Mendel, who documented rules of hereditary and genetic inheritance, was an abbot.\n\nFor a thousand years, the science WAS religion, because the religious folks were often the most literate, and well-read.\n\nBut, it's also important to know the difference between the science and religion and when the two began to diverge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so, yes, before the advent of modern science, the bible and other religious texts, were how humans tried to explain how the world worked.  Early humans didn't know about photons, but it was easy to explain how the sun and light worked by a magic man in the sky.\n\nThe difference is that science changes based on new information, and religions generally does not.",

One character explained his theory to another character which was named \u201eidiot\u201c. The latter person argued (weakly) for the scientific positions of the pope. The \u201eidiot\u201c even deliberately used quotes that the real pope was known for, so there was no way but to acknowledge this insult. It didn\u2019t help Galileo that he immediately sent copies of the book to many important people in various countries. \n\nGalileo could have easily been a little more polite towards the person that financed his research. It\u2019s honestly surprising how mild his sentencing was after he angered the pope/cardinals/inquisition (\u201ehouse arrest\u201c). \n\nScientifically his theory did not hold up either, as we all know. Even at the time other competing theories were a better fit to explain some astronomical phenomena, but he simply ignored the main competing theory completely (even though it solved many of the issues of his theory and he knew that). Being arrogant and needlessly insulting was a bad choice from a scientifically and financially weak position. He was a smart man. But what he did at this point in his life was really dumb.",

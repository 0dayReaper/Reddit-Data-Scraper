[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Human shields are a war crime because it forces the other side to kill civilians, meaning the blood is on the hands of the group using human shields. It is not a war crime to fire back at terrorists who are using human shields - they are committing a war crime by putting those civilians in the way. Using human shields is not some sort of loophole that prevents Israel from firing back at Hamas.",

International law doesn\u2019t imply that every attack in a population center is a war crime because it is written by people who accept that wars can take place in cities. \n\nIt is a much more nuanced matter than \u201cevery attack in a population center is a war crime\u201d.\n\nIf within that population center there is a militarily relevant target with low chances of civilian casualties due to high level of discrimination, that could be a perfectly legal target. After all, modern technology allows one to strike e.g. a single room in a single house. Sure, if you level a whole flat to target a single room, that is much more likely to be a war crime than to destroy a few rooms in a whole flat. \n\nThis is also why many air strikes actually don\u2019t kill civilians. Important reminder here that Israeli quickly bombs hundreds of times within a week and a few dozen people die, which means that the vast majority of strikes do only material damage. This is especially the case since Israel literally warns civilians ahead of time to avoid them being killed.\n\nAs for Hamas comparison, that one is easy to make. Israel literally warns civilians were they will bomb, whereas Hamas openly seeks to kill as many civilians as they can.",

This includes:\n\nWorking together to reduce our vulnerabilities across critical technology supply chains, including by sharing analysis, developing and deepening our channels for coordination and timely consultation during crises. To support the critical clean energy industry, our net zero ambitions and to keep Russia out of the global civil nuclear power market, the UK and US will launch a new civil nuclear partnership.\n\nAn innovative approach targeting specific areas for economic advancement. This includes a commitment in principle to a new UK-US Data Bridge which would make it easier for around 55,000 UK businesses to transfer data freely to certified US organisations without cumbersome red tape \u2013 translating into an estimated \u00a392.4m in direct savings per year. It also includes the immediate launch of negotiations on a Critical Minerals Agreement.\n\nStepping up international efforts to ensure the safe and responsible development of AI, starting with an international summit on AI safety which will be hosted in the UK later this year, welcomed by the US.\n\nEnhancing cooperation on measures to stop our adversaries from developing and acquiring sensitive technologies that can be used to do us harm.\n\nResearch collaboration to entrench UK and US leadership in the most important future technologies \u2013 AI, future telecoms (5G &amp; 6G), quantum, semiconductors and engineering biology.\n\nNew opportunities for increased investment in one another\u2019s economies. President Biden plans to ask the US Congress to designate the UK as a \u2018domestic source\u2019 within the meaning of Title III of the the Defense Production Act \u2013 meaning British companies can benefit from US Government investment on the same basis as American firms. The act has previously been used to speed up the development of hypersonic weapons.***",

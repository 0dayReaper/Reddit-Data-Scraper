The TV channels were then merged in 1980 to form TVNZ, while RNZ stayed seperate. There was then a proposal earlier this year to bring it all back under the one umbrella, but that was declined by the courts because private companies (Mediaworks/Discovery in particular) ~~were scared~~ contested that they would have a monopoly ~~because they provided actual content instead of trashy reality tv and syndicated programming~~.\n\nSo, in conclusion, RNZ has never had television programming and never will, but it's all a clusterfuck anyway so who's counting?",

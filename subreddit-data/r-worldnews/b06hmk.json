They latched onto antivax rhetoric because it absolved them of whatever guilt they were feeling, and provided comfort that none of their future children would be autistic as well. They are both college educated (my dad even went to graduate school in a science- based field) but, in a moment of weakness, clung to something that gave them comfort. Getting vaccinated in my mid 20s isn't fun, but I understand why they did it. \n\nRaising someone with autism is hard, luckily my brother is relatively high-functioning and doesn't demand too much individual attention. Point being, I totally understand why people cling to antivax ideology - fear is a very powerful motivator. ",

They did still get my younger siblings vaccinated however they broke up all the doses.  They never finished mine and I had to hey them when I was in my early teens and knew my immune system could take it.  But then again when I was a kid herd immunity was a thing since anti vax didn't really exist in the 90s like it does now.",

First of all, an important premise: in Italy, education is a right and is compulsory until 16 years of age (so, ideally, halfway through high school).\n\nAnyone is free to decide whether they want their children to go to public school, a private school or homeschool them, as long as certain standards of quality are met. In the case of homeschooling, parents need to formally declare that they want to homeschool their child, demonstrate that they are capable of imparting an education on the same level as public schools, and accept that they will be under surveillance from social services. The child must regularly take exams to demonstrate that they are on the same level as their peers and aren't being denied their education. This means that homeschooling without being able to afford private tutors is extremely hard, since the parents should be able to impart a well-rounded education all on their own, and if the child fails the exams they need to be placed in a public school. \n\nSo, while legal, it's not an easy process and I doubt most anti-vaxxers would be able to met the minimum standards.",

This is what anti vax blogs and YouTube videos tell these people.  Anything contrary to what they say is \"big pharma\" and \"government paid doctors\".\n\nThe biggest thing they're spouting is the warning label on vaccines... Specifically the warning about the 1:1,000,000 chance of having a severe allergic reaction or another kind of reaction that requires an incredibly rare genetic disorder.  They also talk about how there's no \"double blind\" study proving the safety of vaccines.  (Spoiler alert: there are tons)\n\nThey also talk about how courts have awarded nearly 4 billion in vaccine injury cases.  This isn't true.  What they're referring to is a $3.7 Billion escrow fund set up to pay those that win vaccine trials.  Again, you have to be that 1:1,000,000 that has a severe reaction from either allergies or a rare condition.  The odds of winning a vaccine case is about 0.0006%.",

I literally sat in my room for two weeks and she brought me meals and stuff. Pretty much only left to use the bathroom. \n\nOverboard? Maybe a tad. Swine Flu had an extremely low death rate but the news made it seems like Black Plague part 2. But it never entered our mines to get someone else sick and endanger them. I will never respect the ignorant parents that don\u2019t vaccinate their kids and then send them to public places to spread diseases like nothing is wrong. ",

[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2.

There's plenty of alternative routes if this was the case. Saudi normalised relations with Isreal and or it could cut through Egypt or do a joint venture with Iraq into Turkey.\n\nIf you're thinking of the old proposal for the Qatar-Turkey pipeline, a Syrian route was one proposal but another cut them out entirely. \n\n This nonsense falls apart the moment you employ the incredibly advanced technology of \"a map\".",

Then a mix of sectarian groups all vying for power.\n\nThis is still going on in a way, and now we have Ukraine. And we have China looking eagerly toward Russia's performance to test the waters for their invasion of Taiwan, which the US is literally legally required to defend from invasion.\n\nChina is actively buying loyalty from countries in Africa and South America, the latter being seen as within the US sphere of influence. And China is cozying up with Cuba which has echoes of the Cuban Missile Crisis, just with no missiles... yet.\n\nThis is a recipe for a global conflict that would pull in just about every other country.",

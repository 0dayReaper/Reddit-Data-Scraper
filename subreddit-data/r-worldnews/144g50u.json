I get it, but I think there should be programs to provide people housing and funding to help them preserve and dig up what they need to. \n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have to come out of the owners pockets since it\u2019s causing them an inconvenience even though they are doing the morally sound thing by telling officials and historians. That also might provide incentive for me people to go about it the right way. \n\nI feel like going about it the right way might be worth it in the end because you get to know EVERYTHING about your house and land and can build around it properly. You know, make sure there aren\u2019t any unsealed wells hidden somewhere, a risk of sink holes, etc.. \n\nA lot of beauty can come from these aggravating, but really neat historic finds. I\u2019ve seen some people find historic wells, dungeons, etc. hidden underneath their home before and made it apart of their home, decorating around it afterwards.\n\nOne person lit up this old well they had found and then put heavy duty glass floors down, enclosing it, so that you could walk over it and see down it. It was really, really cool and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a major conversation piece when hosting dinner parties, etc..",

In comparison, anatomically modern humans appear in Africa around 300,000 years ago.\n\nInterestingly, there is a photo of the Carnac stones on the English Wikipedia page for \"Brittany.\"",

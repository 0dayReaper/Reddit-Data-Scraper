We used to be a force on the battlefield in both world wars and Korea.  We used to have a thriving R&amp;D research framework for things such as the Avro Aero.    \n\nToday - we've given up on that.  We produce nothing. We have nearly no fundamental science research programs.   No manufacturing and no real home grown material.  \n\nWhy?  No funding.  \n\nWe absolutely cannot be a useful member of NATO or even the United Nations if we cannot project any form of influence whether it be force or development programs.\n\nI would not be so annoyed at this if we could point to some major win or positive aspect but we aren't even able to manage our economy right now.",

Canada has planned to increase the number of military bases in the artic to make sure our claim is respected ( it's very silly, but that's world politics for ya).\n\nThat being said, I do agree that the immediate need of Ukraine is more pressing, but we should look into boosting it in the future.

By your metric the only argument you'll accept is that the planned military equipment exist and be in the inventory right this instant, because anything short of that isn't proof (by your standards) that the government actually intends to spend the money.  Of course you're conveniently ignoring the fact that the reason the Aegis destroyers haven't started construction yet is the fact that the shipyards are already busy building the Harry DeWolf class, which is yet more proof that contradicts your argument that these contracts never get followed through with.  \n\nAnd again, you ignore the point that you admitted that you personally don't believe that the government will even have that money in the near future because of economic conditions.  Unless you believe that Trudeau can personally change Canada's economic conditions, which would make me seriously question your understanding of economics, you've just admitted that your personal belief is that the problem is impossible to fix while still insisting on blaming a single politician for not fixing it.",

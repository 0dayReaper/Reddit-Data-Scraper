[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

At least none elderly one and that's their voters.\n\nI hate how corrupt PiS is. They only care about keeping loyal members in their party, no matter how incompetent or corrupt they are.",

Look at these fucking results:\n\n100% of voting Republicans voted no on both articles. 99% of Democrats voted yes on both articles. Only one independent representative *existed*.\n\nBy contrast, the nay [votes on Andrew Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson) were split 50/50. And 15 out of 100 votes across the [Republican vote on Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton) were nay.\n\nThere is a clear adherence to party lines rather than public opinion or observation of the evidence. We could have just skipped the entire proceedings and gone straight to the vote. Why should we be okay with this?",

This alliance promotes policies that enable the wealthy to hoard more income without paying their fair share back to the community, the evangelical Christians are allowed to express xenophobia freely and openly and the uneducated working class continue to loss more freedoms and social supports. It may seem a pretty unfair deal, but somehow they are all happy with it for now.\n\nThe right have become so much better at having a narrow, concise and clear philosophy on every issue. They have rejected nuance in favour of slogans and the populace eats it up. The left on the other hand take a scattergun approach at a range of social and economic policy which require voter engagement, because they represent something different they elicit fear and emotion, especially fear, is a stronger driving factor than rationality.\n\nThis isn't a both sides are bad matter, this is clearly a result of the neo-conservatist MO. They are creating their own reality and they have the numbers, they have exposed how truly broken the system is.\n\nAt this change the only way I can see things shifting is having another generation of older voters die out and be replaced by the youth reaching voting age. However I fear that with a generation to prepare the conservatives will find enough ways to stack the deck to make even this a sizeable task.\n\nTL;DR democracy is broken.",

            "comment": "Okay for everyone wondering what impeachment is vs a removal of office.\n\nImpeachment is like charging you with a crime. So the House of Representatives charged Trump with abuse of power &amp; obstruction of congress.\n\nRemoval of office comes about when the House of Representatives vote by a majority to impeach on each charge (known as an Article of Impeachment), that goes to the Senate, and then by a 2/3 majority (67 Senators) in the Senate to vote to convict, and only then is the President is finally removed from office.\n\nIn other words, impeachment is like being charged by the DA for manslaughter, removal of office is when the jury decides you're guilty of manslaughter. The DA is the House, and the jury is the Senate in this analogy.\n\nEDIT: Instead of giving me gold (just DM me your potatoes), please take the time to check that you're registered to [vote](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/) and consider donating to the ACLU or [Fair Fight 2020](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vsafairfight), an organization ran by Stacey Abrams (GA 2018 Gov nominee) that protects the right to vote. Fair Fight 2020 specifically focuses on fighting against voter purges.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI keep getting asked whether or not a President that has been impeached and removed from office can hold office again. He cannot if the Senate votes as to do as such specifically (source 3)\n\nSource 1\n\nThe Constitution of the United States, Article 1, [Section 2](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-2--2), Paragraph 5\n\n&gt; The House of Representatives shall have the sole Power of Impeachment\n\nSource 2\n\nThe Constitution of the United States, Article 1, [Section 3](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-3--2), Paragraph 6\n\n&gt; The Senate shall have sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.\n\nSource 3\n\nThe Constitution of the United States, Article 1, [Section 3](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-3--2), Paragraph 7 \n\n&gt; Judgement in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States; but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgement and Punishment, according to Law.",

This means the House can definitely change wildly during any term, mid-term or full term.\n\nOnly approximately 1/3 of Senate seats come up in mid-terms or full terms - every two years.  A senator serves for 6 years.  This means that it takes quite a bit longer for the Senate to change the water than the house.\n\nWhen you look at the 1/3 of all Senate seats up for re-election in a given term or mid-term, only a small number will be \"battleground\", meaning the seat has a chance of changing sides.  So practically speaking, it really takes multiple 2-year terms to budge the Senate in one direction or another.  \n\nAnd quite a few senators have been very successful at maintaining their seats over very long terms, as the longer one serves, the more powerful the committees they get to serve on and the more influence they wield.  This in turn leads to more support from moneyed interests, which helps to maintain the seat through election advertising over the long term.",

So the chairman would need to make sure he had enough support before trying to suppress something.\n\nCommittees are generally bi-partisan as well, so if the chairman tries to hide something it's highly likely someone on the committee will make a public stink.  In general committees tend to work together reasonably well, except of course in cases like this that are super-partisan.  Lots of things die in committee, but they can be brought back if the water changes.",

Living in a small town I get to hear first-hand what the thoughts of the average conservative are, and it's scary as fuck.\n\nSomething I tell my moderately-conservative friends is that there's only one side of the story that I've heard from the horses mouth. I have never met an Antifa supporter, but holy shit have I met more literally insane racist rednecks than I would have ever imagined possible. My parents think that leftists propaganda has brainwashed me- but in reality just listening to conservatives talk has opened my eyes to just how bad our situation is. All of my evidence against the right wing has come from the right wing itself.",

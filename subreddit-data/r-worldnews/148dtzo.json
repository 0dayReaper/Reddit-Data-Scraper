[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Everybody knows that it's a tool they want to use against the opposition (because, basically, all the tools are already present in the legislature, but... They require a court's order/ruling to be used. Now they don't need the court).\n\nEverybody also knows that the law is badly written. Even Duda knows this, because - AFTER signing it - he sent it over to the Julia Przylebska's Constitutional Tribunal, saying that \"he's aware of people's concerns about the law, so let's allow the Tribunal to rule on it\".\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, he then said that \"the Tribunal spends most of its time on in-fighting so I'll introduce amendments to the law\". You know, the one he signed within hours of receiving it, even though he has a couple of weeks to do that.",

If you want to go by the letter of the law, that's not even the only circumstance, in which abortion is legal. However, all of these require administrative hoops, deliberately designed to delay the procedure, or prevent it altogether. \n\nThis new wave of complaints has started after *another* death from lack of immediacy in executing women's right to abortion, but a better example of how abortion is almost impossible in Poland despite it being legal, are cases of rape: These are pregnancies, which women are technically allowed to abort, but in practice almost never happen (one or two cases a year, in a country of almost 40mln people). Because yes, you are allowed to abort a fetus from rape, as long as:\n\n* You can prove pregnancy is the result of rape.\n\n* Find a doctor willing to administer procedure at all.\n\n* Find a doctor willing to risk an investigation/legal challenge after current right-wing government and it's allied organisations drag them to court for it.\n\n* Find a consultant willing to approve the procedure/confirm it is necessary once you have the doctor to do so.\n\nIt's not a surprise that women are dying waiting for these procedures. It's a surprise more of them aren't end up dead to begin with.",

Pure self interest alone and not wanting their newfound vulnerabilities exploited systematically (which keep in mind men are already taught to not be vulnerable) and having a disproportionate amount of political power is why it's more likely than not that if men could get pregnant, you'd be able to get abortions anywhere wherever. Traditionally it's always been men's independence celebrated, not women's. And these deeply ingrained norms wouldn't fade overnight.",

Third trimester abortions are extremely rare and are only done if the mother's life is in immediate critical danger because it is safer to stabilize the mother so she can go to term than to introduce the physical trauma of an extremely late term abortion.\n\nAnd of course being that there are no abortion laws there is also no abortion on demand.",

There's also stuff like Aegis. \n\nIt's not clear that Russia could actually land a nuclear strike with its aging nuclear weapons systems.\n\nSo under the doctrine of MAD, they should have used them already, because Mutual Assurance no longer exists. Especially when thanks to open skies and the nuclear disarmament treaties, we know where all their nukes are.\n\nThe time is coming when the US Military will be able to unilaterally disarm its nuclear stockpile and just spend the rest of the money on conventional weapons it can use in any conflict, because no nuclear weapons can make it through US defenses.\n\nSo nullified, in your comment, is past-tense.\n\nRemember: hypersonic missiles were supposed to be unstoppable.\n\nIn a recent attack on Kyiv, Patriot shot down every single one.\n\nInterestingly, google the US nuclear doctrine.\n\nIt promises an immediate *conventional* response to any use of nuclear weapons. So it seems the military is confident it won't need nuclear weapons to respond to nuclear weapons.\n\nThe fact that they might be wrong is why they won't start anything.\n\nBut we're returning to a potential era of conventional war between great powers.",

So even countries that might find themselves ideologically aligned with Iran would still be extremely reluctant to actually help them acquire nuclear weapons.\n\n&gt;I have been hearing about them trying to get nuclear weapons for ages.\n\nIt's difficult to say if they really have been.  That's the assumption everyone makes, but they've insisted from the start that it's purely civilian research purposes (unlike North Korea which said they were developing nukes).  They didn't start doing serious enrichment of uranium until the US withdrew from the JCPOA, so it's hard to say if they would have done it eventually regardless (Trump's argument), or if they felt that it was the one thing they could do to force the US to rejoin the agreement.  The problem is that now they're at a stalemate because Iran is in violation of the JCPOA, so the US won't lift the sanctions until Iran goes back to compliance, but if Iran goes back to compliance, they lose all their leverage.\n\n&gt;Cant they just buy nukes off russia or something?\n\nBelieve it or not, no nation has ever outright sold nuclear weapons to another.  They have based nuclear weapons in other nations, but they have never given them the ability to use them.  Russia would never sell Iran nuclear weapons.  They might agree to position some ICBMs in Iran, but there's no way they'd give Khamenei or his generals the launch codes.",

My guess is that they do not want a nuclear weapon. What they want is not to be at the mercy of the US economically. So they were happy to take the deal (no weapons, no sanctions). When Trump pulled out, they started ratcheting up purification ('look, we could have a nuclear weapon if we wanted') as a lever. They want a deal that the US can't renege on (again).",

Iran wants nukes, we don\u2019t want them to have nukes, for many reasons (nuclear proliferation in general, their government being known assholes in particular).\n\nBy creating an environment where there is something they want *more* than nukes (less sanctions), you create a paradigm where their best interest is to abandon nukes. It\u2019s not that you trust them to do the right thing or believe them when they say they don\u2019t want nukes anymore. As long as you can trust them to act in their best interest, they\u2019ll go along.\n\nThe big risk is always the chance that they will try to have their cake and eat it too, of course, but that\u2019s why so much of the details of these deals always focuses on inspection and verification. Having a terrifyingly overpowered intelligence apparatus helps, of course.\n\nWould you lend the guy at work who doesn\u2019t pay people back $100 in exchange for him covering your shift and paying you back next week? Probably not. Would you do it if you could fire him from his job, cut off his internet, get his partner to leave him, and had proof that he could pay you back? Maybe worth it.",

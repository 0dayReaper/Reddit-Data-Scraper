It happened in Ukraine with the [Euromaidan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan) and it cost the lives of 108 people with nearly 2000 injured. People in Iran are attempting to enact change. Who knows how many lives that has cost.\n\nRussia isn't going to be changed from the outside. The only thing we on the outside can do is tell the Russians who want change to work to enact that change. It's not going to be easy. It's going to cost lives. But in an authoritarian state with questionable elections, it's the only way for it to happen.\n\nWe on the outside have no obligation to pat the heads of those whose silence is enabling the genocide of Ukrainians.",

Putin was just the guy who most effectively took advantage of the rampant corruption, imperialist national identity, philosophical nihilism, and political \"need\" for a strongman leader. Russia has hundreds of years of history of brutal leadership, repression, and effective single-party authoritarian rule, with tiny, aberrant interruptions that are quickly removed. They are a nation that mythologizes their past glory to mask their current misery, and where the acquisition of power resembles, and sometimes literally is, a gang war. Their state religion preaches conformity above all else and acts as a propaganda arm of the government. Their military is at war with itself, with institutionalized beatings, rape, and killings, and they have literal execution squads to \"encourage\" their enlisted soldiers to charge into a meat grinder with minimal training, inadequate equipment, and no support.\n\nWhile Putin is the one who started this war, there are tens of thousands of Russians who have engaged in it and are responsible for the operational and tactical decisions that continue to lead to atrocities. Putin gained, and remains in, power because millions of Russians either enthusiastically chose a brutal authoritarian or felt, based on their life experience and knowledge of Russian history, that he, or someone exactly like him, was inevitable, and resistance would only mean more suffering.",

The abuses in the Russian military dated back to the Soviet army. The rampant corruption carried over as well, and accelerated under Yeltsin, and then again under Putin. The difference is that the influx of wealth kept the growing Russian middle class from becoming politically engaged and allowed Putin to get away with demanding larger tributes from the oligarchs he supported and protected because the profits were so much higher to begin with. The war in Ukraine actually dates back to 2014 and the invasion of Crimea, and Georgia was attacked in 2008. Russia wasn't on a better track before 2016. It was just benefiting from global oil prices and the available money made it an attractive new market for amoral corporate investment.",

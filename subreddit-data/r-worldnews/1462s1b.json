They've certainly skirted western sanctions and should shut up about being neutral. They're likely as far in Russia's camp as the west is in Ukraine's when they propose \"peace\" without peace and ironically choose to supply arms to the last truly European empire (Russia), it's just that South Africa is not a great partner, so it comes off as a joke to some. It's not a joke, it's a disgrace.",

If Ukraine has to sacrifice every bit of justice they are owed, that's a condition that is acceptable for countries in BRICS.\n\nEdit: And to anyone who is against the west, this isn't a sport, I'm not even taking a geopolitical stance. I'm not speaking on behalf of any national interests. This is purely a moral stance I have. If you disagree don't bring up geopolitical bullshit because I don't care, I don't care about your national interests.

Where is the justice for Iraq? Why haven't Bush (and Blair etc.) not been accused of war crimes by the ICC and faced justice? But whatever, you'll have some lame-arsed excuse I'm sure.",

[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Our innocent doonscroller generates more revenue for Facebook because the posts are emotionally charged, and Facebook recognizes this and shows that person more of the same thing. Eventually, this person comes to antagonize law enforcement on the whole, a conclusion they likely would never have made based solely on their own interactions with police, which are more probably more pleasant than what Facebook demonstrates.",

I hate both PiS and Konfederacja parties, so my initial reaction to them being unbanned was \"oh fuck no\", but after I thought about it it might be positive for people who wish for a regime change in Poland. Konfederacja cannot really steal votes from the opposition, so they would have to try to flip PiS electorate.\n\nBUT. and this is a very huge \"BUT\". First of all there is a non 0 possibility of Konfederacja just fucking over their own voters after they get in power and making a coalition with PiS, because they care about power only and do not respect their own voters, so their sudden reemergence might be hurtful for opposition after all. PiS was on a downfall path already, so lets hope that they don't get the get out of jail card by making a coalition with neonazis... And the other thing is that even if opposition wins and the meddling of Konfederacja actually helped to change things I still think that the hatred and division that they spread every day is worth the \"positive\" effect in the end.  They are by far the most vocal shitheads on the Polish political scene and they thrive on hate.",

I remember when these guys were kids and they were hailing and talking trash about immigrants and later they were appearing on radio on occasion, defending the worst scumbags solely based on religion and dog whistling to the apes from ONR. The only reason they are still appearing in media is because of the general right wing shift in narratives starting in 2010 and the fact that they keep hiding behind market freedoms, which eventually became a dog whistle on it's own, carrying the agenda of trade with Russia, which these guys are knee-deep in.  \nI used to be naive too. I thought people are paranoid about them, but the more I saw, the more obvious it became, that they're not being honest. Their main accomplishment was convincing impressionable men, that freedom is the choice between obedience to your boss and homelessness. Today they have a chance at gaining seats in parliament because people are annoyed by status quo politics, which is understandable, but they're still just a far right party hooking on to public angst, just like fascists generally do. They will solve no problem and destroy what's left of agreements within EU that keep us strong against Russia and important on international level.",

It's again the same situation as with major parties - it sucks, yes, but it could be worse, WAY worse. The discussions on right wing enclaves are interesting, but they generally oscillate around untrue interpretations of events to a larger degree than it happens here. I've been there, done that. It was a nice ride but looking back, the biggest success of mine was withholding my vote until I had it all figured out.\n\nElecting a corrupt populist party again will cause harm but after 4 years, their programme and socio-political landscape will change and we'll be out voting again. Electing far right party is a one way street. The next elections will be worth as much as in Belarus and there won't be a way to come back to normal life from this. There won't be access to true information, there won't be actual investigative journalism.  If I can suggest the strategic approach to this - right now we're surviving a crisis. We need need to just keep calm, composed, not do anything extravagant. Once things calm down, everything will clarify and our view on the politics will cool down again and the society will be ready to vote in their interest.\n\nNow, you might wonder why Konfederacja is so fixated on abortion. They're christian fundamentalists. This goes way beyond abortion. For example Mentzen wants to prohibit women from divorcing, which obviously means that marital violence and rape will become legal. Things like these miss your ear because of the rhetorics of euphemism, but listen to what they say again in company of liberals and it'll be clear as day that none of their programme is achievable under Constitution.",

Literally few minutes before of those 25 seconds and after those 25 seconds explains all. You have to watch context.\n\nYou were manipulated.\n\n\nThat's how you are falling for propaganda.",

It's actually more likely that you're just a brainwashed kuc kid than a nazi.

Otherwise you're headed down a path of extreme loneliness as the world around you progresses, and you're left behind. The feeling of rejection will build your spite, push you towards even more extreme views, which will only alienate you farther. You will live a truly miserable life of a bitter person, and you'll keep telling yourself that it's the world's fault and that you were wronged.\n\nBut you weren't, and are not. \\*\\*You\\*\\* are wrong, and you're on the wrong side of history.  \n\n\nEdit: Btw, work ended and I now have better stuff to do than reply to you, so papatki",

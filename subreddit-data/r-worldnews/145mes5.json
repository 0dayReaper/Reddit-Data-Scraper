The RAF usually operate these sorties from the numerous bases up that way, since they're intercepting over the North Sea. They don't usually go supersonic until they're out over the waters, but depending on wind direction, cloud cover or if they've had to throttle up early, you can still hear the booms a little way inland.",

It would have been crowded, something would have been blown up, and everything would have VERY quickly escalated into WW3.  \n\n\nIt sucks that Russia controls the sea and can operate with impunity within it, it sucks that Ukraine is having trouble getting grains out; but the US Navy can't get \"in\" and be annoying, and the Russian Navy can't get \"out\" without immediately getting sunk (unless an honest surrender happens..).",

Here is what Wikipedia says:\n\n&gt; The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 (HKHRDA) is a United States federal law that requires the U.S. government to impose sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for human rights abuses in Hong Kong, and requires the United States Department of State and other agencies to conduct an annual review to determine whether changes in Hong Kong's political status (its relationship with mainland China) justify changing the unique, favorable trade relations between the U.S. and Hong Kong.\n\n&gt; Initially introduced in 2014 following the Umbrella Movement and 2014 democracy protests in Hong Kong, the legislation was re-introduced to the next three successive Congresses, but did not gain a vote until 2019, following the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill proposal and the ensuing protests against it.\n\nLink to the bill in full: https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2019/11/19/senate-section/article/S6650-1\n\nThis bill, \u201cPROHIBITING THE COMMERCIAL EXPORT OF COVERED MUNITIONS ITEMS TO THE HONG KONG POLICE FORCE; Congressional Record Vol. 165, No. 185\u201d, is incredibly consequential, IMO: https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2019/11/19/senate-section/article/S6660-1\n\nThe ban of munition on HK Police will last for one year from its enactment day, according to the bill itself.",

There are also widespread concerns about their economy being much smaller than they actually tout due to fudged reporting and accounting. \n\nTheir population is massive, but has a massive demographic problem in relation to age. \n\nTheir diplomatic skills are amateurish at best. They wield it like a hammer and are too thin-skinned about criticism to and so end up burning up their goodwill reserves and benefits of the doubt on completely worthless \"goals\", not realizing that it harms them and leaves them more vulnerable in the long term. \n\nThey have an incredibly strong hand, but the Party has absolutely squandered it and its going to cost them dearly in the not so distant future unless they learn to play the game better.",

PolyU has just fallen into the hands of HKPF earlier today and who knows what will happen to our friends there, some of us are already being transported to China with the help of MTR earlier this week. So, please don't think we've won just because of this law, we have a long way to go.\n\nEdit: You can help us by spreading the message that this fight is far from over, boycott Chinese products as much as you can (although it\u2019s easier said than done), encourage the media to monitor the situation in HK and have them keep an eye of the brutality of HKPF. If you do have time and money, come to Hong Kong and record what you see, we have much less Chinese visiting us now so there will be a lot more room for you to explore and hotel prices are a lot lower now. Of course, the best thing you can do is to join the protests and gatherings, they should be safe as long as the Police don\u2019t swoop in and screw everything up, but your safety is the top priority. Anyway, thank you all for your support, without you we wouldn\u2019t have come this far.\n\nEdit 2: Yes, this law is going to hurt Hong Kong's economy, but who cares? We young people never benefited from a booming economy anyways. In fact, that's our point, hurting the economy enough so that the government will bend their knees down.",

Work slowly. Think of ways to increase the number of movements needed to do your job: use a light hammer instead of a heavy one; try to make a small wrench do instead of a big one.\n\n\n**Transportation:** Make train or air travel as inconvenient as possible. One particularly effective trick: issue two tickets for the same seat on a train in order to set up an \u201cinteresting\u201d argument.",

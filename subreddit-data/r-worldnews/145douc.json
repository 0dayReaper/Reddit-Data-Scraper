One barrel is 7.25 metric tonnes, so that is about \u20ac82 per barrel of oil products on average.\n\nFor comparison: Directly after the start of the invasion, when prices exploded, they were selling 280 thousand metric tonnes of oil products a day for roughly 240 million euros which comes down to \u20ac118 per barrel of oil products on average, so the price they are getting is down roughly 30% from the absolute peak.",

[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1.

I just wish he'd go away. He wasn't about governing, people or anything beyond his own pockets and ego. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe positioned himself as the sole individual who'd be able to deliver Brexshit ... something he fumbled and FUBAR'd from the get go and his loyal little following seemed to conveniently ignore the fact he was originally in favour of staying IN the EU and even wrote two articles/opinion pieces for when the result came through to cover his arse as always having been on the \"winning\" side. God forbid he make a mistake or a wrong call. Like Trumpleshitstain he can't factor in the fact he isn't perfect and isn't beloved of all.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHis current seat as an MP was looking tenuous at best and he likely wouldn't have won it again or, if he had, with a severely reduced majority. So he quits, like a petchulant child, throws his toys out his pram and sulks off home whilst throwing out insults and snide commentary. Ever the thin-skinned egomanical Eton boy.",

He won the 2019 GE in a landslide victory which was voted *BY THE GENERAL PUBLIC*.\n\nThis vote happened just *months* after he took over from May. It takes time to setup a GE, and it was done extremely quickly. He didn't even have to do it, but he did, because he had the confidence of the party and the general public.\n\nYou wrote:\n\n\\&gt; Either way, it wasn\u2019t the general public.\n\nYou are purposely misinterpreting the facts to spread misinformation.\n\nHe had the mandate of the general public to be the leader of the government, by an absolutely HUGE amount, even converting a number those red wall constituencies\n\nAs for \"having the evidence\" I posted 3 links to show this.\n\nYou are twisting what happened to spread misinformation, and that should be a bannable offense.\n\nI hate Bojo as much as the next person, but there's no need to spread misinformation to support your twisted, incorrect views.\n\nSince it's clear that you're here just to spread misinformation, there's zero point engaging further.

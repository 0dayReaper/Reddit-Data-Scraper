Like raping a prostitute is the same as not paying the dry-cleaners.\n\nEdit: I got this from the Reply All episode 128 The Crime Machine. Transcript of the segment:\n\n \n\nPJ: Ritchie was working during that era that John was puzzling over. The era where the crime rate just kept going down and down and down. And he told me a story about what that was like. This story about a thing that happened one night when he was working late in the Bronx.\u00a0\n\n*RITCHIE: Ah lemme see, it was in the fall -- I think 2011 or 2012. I\u2019m in this fixed post, me and my partner, 149 and 3rd.*\u00a0\n\nPJ: Ritchie and his partner had been told to just stand on this one street corner all night. It\u2019s this intersection in a commercial part of town, so it\u2019s all these retail stores. But it\u2019s midnight, so all the stores are closed. It\u2019s the kind of assignment where most nights you just stand there and nothing happens until the sun comes up. But that night, this guy runs up to them and says, \u201cHey, something really bad is going on. You gotta help.\u201d\u00a0\n\n*RITCHIE: He says, \u201cListen, I see a guy dragging a lady into a vacant lot. I think he\u2019s gonna rape her.\u201d So we got in the car. We drive. And I hear a lady screaming, \u201cHelp help help.\u201d So I see him on top of her. He\u2019s punching her, and he\u2019s raping her. So I flash my light. I tell him, \u201cStop.\u201d He stop. And I tell them, both of them, \u201cCome towards me.\u201d They both starts walking. So she has a black eye. Both have their pants down.*\u00a0\n\nPJ: The victim starts to tell Ritchie what happened. And he says thinking back now, the thing that still stands out to him is just how precise she was in the way she described it.\u00a0\n\n*RITCHIE: She says, \u201cHe raped me. I know I'm a prostitute, but no money was exchanged. He assaulted me, and he inserted his penis inside my vagina without my consent, while he was assaulting me.\u201d So she basically broke down the definition of rape. Textbook.* \n\nPJ: So Ritchie calls the crime in over the radio, and his boss shows up at the scene.\u00a0\n\n*RITCHIE: And basically he tried questioning her. The way he was questioning her- they\u2013they question the victim several times and try to see if you change your story slightly.*\n\nPJ: Ritchie knew exactly what his boss was up to. His boss did not want to enter this victim\u2019s crime into CompStat. And so what he was doing was he was questioning her over and over and over again, trying to find some hole in her story that would give him an excuse to treat the crime as something less than rape. He was trying to downgrade her crime.\u00a0\n\n*PJ: What\u2019s the kind of change that would allow a downgrade?*\n\n*RITCHIE: Well, they was trying to make it as a theft of service.*\u00a0\n\n*PJ: Theft of service?*\u00a0\n\n*RITCHIE: Yeah. Prostitution is not legal in the state of New York.*\u00a0\n\n*PJ: It\u2019s also just somebody, calling somebody who\u2019s a rape victim, saying it\u2019s theft of service because they are a prostitute, just feels--*\n\n*RITCHIE: It\u2019s dehumanizing, it\u2019s degrading, it\u2019s making that person feel less than zero.*\u00a0\n\n*RITCHIE: So that same sergeant after he questioned her several times and she didn\u2019t change--*\n\n*PJ: So she was standing her ground.*\u00a0\n\n*RITCHIE: She was standing her ground.*\n\n*PJ: Did she, did you get the sense that she knew why he was asking the questions he was asking?*\n\n*RITCHIE: Yes, she said that previously, uh, it happened to her. And they shitcanned it.*\u00a0\n\n*So she said the detective that was there said, \u201cNext time this happens to you, you have to say it this way.\u201d*\n\n*PJ: The detective had told her, \u201cHere\u2019s what you have to say so that your crime counts?\u201d*\n\n*RITCHIE: Yes.*\n\nPJ: So eventually Ritchie\u2019s boss actually gave up.\u00a0\n\n*RITCHIE: He was like, \u201cWow.\u201d So the sergeant, he was like, \u201cRitchie, just type up the report. Rape. If they say anything, tell him I told you.\u201d I said, \u201cOK.\u201d*\n\nPJ: So Ritchie went back to the station and he did it. He put the crime into the system. It would count. And he said as soon as he put that report into the system, somebody must have gotten a notification.\u00a0\n\n*RITCHIE: Five minutes after I finished writing it up, they came to the room where I was at. \u201cWho told you to do that?\u201d*\n\n*PJ: Who\u2019s they? Who came in?*\n\n*RITCHIE: Uh, you had the commanding officer and two\u2013his two lieutenants. He was like, \u201cWho told you to do that?\u201d You know, I said, \u201cThe sergeant told me.\u201d So they left it alone.\u00a0Because now it\u2019s in the system. There\u2019s no way they can explain it away.*\u00a0\n\nPJ: Ritchie\u2019s bosses had been so afraid to add a dot to their crime map, that they were willing to let a rapist go. But because Ritchie got his way, the guy would be charged with the actual crime he committed.\u00a0\n\n*RITCHIE: Not only that, they took a DNA sample from the, from the rapist, and it linked to two other rape victims in Manhattan.*\u00a0\n\n*PJ: If it had been written as theft of services, would they have done the DNA test?*\u00a0\n\n*RITCHIE: No, \u2019cause it\u2019s not a DNA-qualifying crime.*\u00a0\n\nPJ: Ritchie said crime downgrading happened all the time\u2014because of CompStat.\u00a0\n\n*RITCHIE: What CompStat did it\u2019s basically turning NYPD from not being expert in fighting crime, but being expert on how to downgrade crimes in order for commanding officers to go to the next level.*",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; As the Wuhan coronavirus death toll rose to at least 18 on Thursday, the Chinese government is facing questions over its vice grip on the flow of information in the early days of the outbreak.\n\n&gt; There have also been concerning reports of journalists being detained or threatened with arrest while reporting on the coronavirus in Wuhan.\n\n&gt; The Hong Kong news outlet TVB reported on January 14 that a group of journalists, including a reporter from their outlet, were detained for hours while covering the outbreak at a Wuhan hospital that has been treating patients.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/et3ivb/china_spent_the_crucial_first_days_of_the_wuhan/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~461411 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **report**^#1 **Wuhan**^#2 **government**^#3 **outbreak**^#4 **Time**^#5",

                    "comment": "I don\u2019t live in China right now, but many of my family &amp; friends do (none in Wuhan or Hebei province though). Things are really fucked up there.\n\nOn Weibo there are videos &amp; pics of hospitals crowded as hell. People write about they could not get admitted in hospital and those with milder symptoms were advised to be quarantined at home. Some people dying at home are not counted in official statistics. Hospitals are also in dire need of face masks &amp; protection gears, and those hospitals are literally asking the outside public to help them out. That\u2019s true. We. Us. The public. Doing what obviously govt should but fails to do. Many Chinese people overseas have organized themselves masks to Wuhan. There\u2019s a hospital getting built? That\u2019s true, but there is a lack of construction workers and it turns out to be the public trying to spread this message &amp; get help. Everyone knows about the lockdown, but the government didn\u2019t even think how could those medical workers go to work before shutting down all public transport. People in Wuhan are organizing themselves to drive them to hospitals in private cars.\n\nAll those I said could be true or fake news. The problem  is, there are few news media outlet in China that I trust enough (Caixin being one of them). The People\u2019s Daily of 24th has 7.5 pages about the Chinese New Year (one entire page on \u201cwintersweet flower\u201d but less than half a page on the epidemic.\n\nAnother question is, many elderly people don\u2019t like wearing masks. They feel like \u201clife or death are in the hands of fate/God\u201d and horribly confident after living through SARS years ago. The younger generation are trying hard to simply tell their family to wear masks ffs.\n\nAlso keep in mind not everyone is better off enough to get accessed to internet and the latest news. Many worry about those marginal population, but don\u2019t know how to help them...\n\nI usually don\u2019t comment on news, cuz I got family &amp; friends living in China. But things are really terrible. And I feel like you shall know.\n\n\u2014\u2014\nEdit: thanks for the gold &amp; silver! I\u2019ll add a few more recent stuff.\n\nThe \u201clack of construction workers for building a new hospital\u201d might be fake news, as some authority has claimed so. There\u2019s still a lack of experts in civil engineering &amp; construction to my knowledge though.\n\nThe \u201cSpring Festival Gala\u201d was held on CCTV (state central tv channel) a few hours ago. There\u2019s a special performance of \u201creciting poems against epidemic\u201d which was newly added. Some Wuhan people posted on Weibo that they felt too miserable to watch the show where everyone being so happy.\n\nAll those major recreational facilities like Disneyland in Shanghai are closed. You can find a more detailed list at CNN.\n\nThere are more confirmed cases out of China, including one in the US. Don\u2019t panic, just stay alarmed, and do all those hygiene things for the sake of yourself and those you care.\n\nAs I mentioned, the people are helping each other out. The government is completely incompetent in this whole thing, so be aware, stay alarmed, and please pray for the Chinese people. Many of them are praying for the death of You-Know-Who.",

So if they throw out a giant propaganda net, eventually you will find something, somewhere that is articulated in a way that you find amenable and say \"Well I guess it's not all so bad. At least I can rest assured that some of my money goes towards these poor chinese families just trying to survive when I buy something from them.\" or something else that makes you rethink being totally against anything and everything Chinese (other than their non-government affiliated people ofcourse). \n\nI hate to say it, but the only thing that will stop China is to stop doing business with them, letting their citizens suffer for it, and their economy collapsing. \n\nWhich means the people of the world need to not buy anything that has financial ties to China (good luck with that if you're on a budget) and also send letters to those same companies that do business with China and tell them that China is the reason you refuse to buy from them.\n\naka, as a people we need to shift our values from money to investing in our future. Your actions matter even if they feel impotent; even if that snowball is still gaining speed and mass, by slowing it down for a second or two, maybe enough people can band together to cause change in the time we bought.

The  gravity of situation here is unimaginable.....this is what is actually happening inside the hospital, just like a bio hazard\" and he was coughing heavily in the end......\n\n[2nd Footage](https://twitter.com/CristoSabrozon/status/1220544927303700488)\n\n[3rd footage](https://twitter.com/badiucao/status/1220358585713999874)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[There is a footage](https://youtu.be/oY64klryE9E) of medical staff facing mental breakdown with the overwhelming situation\n\nHe was saying : There are patients lying all over the floor of the hospital! We worked for 4 shift per day! Are you not going to let us live?! I can't do this more..... get them (the patients) out! get them out! I can't do this anymore! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[There are footages](https://www.facebook.com/100000150464406/posts/3202562866425364/) of people suddenly collapsing in public areas and medical staff went to handle the situation\n\n[another footage](https://twitter.com/badiucao/status/1220374770308374528) of person collapsing on street\n\n[Yet another footage](https://twitter.com/bosstandswithhk/status/1220418807967244295) of a person fell unconscious in subway\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whole city of Wuhan along with 3 other Nearby cities have been declared quarantine zone yesterday.

The city is quiet like a ghost town, 95% of the people on the street are wearing masks. Most of the shop has closed but shops like supermarket is still operating, there's currently no shortage of food except vegetables or instant noodles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight before the quarantine was in effect, a lot of Wuhan citizens are escaped from their homes and quite a large amount of them claimed to have arrived at Shanghai because it is a large city and close to Wuhan, so Shanghai might as well be the next zone of outbreak\n\n[Footage of](https://twitter.com/xinyanyu/status/1220246913511051264) suspected carrier from Wuhan arriving at Shanghai airport, detained and transported in quarantine box to hospital\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Wubei provincial gov has just raised emergency alert level to level I, which is the level equivalent to nuclear disaster\n\n[Offical Statement from Webei provinical gov](http://www.hubei.gov.cn/zhuanti/2020/gzxxgzbd/zxtb/202001/t20200124_2014659.shtml) (in Chinese)\n\nThe situation there is just like a fucking movie right now\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit :with footage of various sources added",

I've read a lot of recent Chinese novels and talked to writers, and the publishers will tell the writers they need to add more pro-Chinese propaganda or they won't publish their work, or they will remove it if it is already published. The things that they're told to add generally include, saying the Chinese invented X first, and the West copied them. Saying racial slurs and badmouthing other ethnic groups (especially Japan, Philippines, etc.). Examples I've seen are, claiming the Japanese are monkeys who bully the Chinese and steal their land among other things. A big one is the promotion of traditional Chinese medicine. At best you have writers claiming that traditional Chinese medicine is just as good as Western medicine. More often you will see claims that it's completely superior to Western medicine, and it can cure many things that Western medicine can't. FYI, this is literature that is mostly read by younger millennials in their 20s.",

There's something unsettlingly fascinating about it. Like the wrath of God or something. \n\nI had no idea about the rain and chemical burns. It doesn't surprise me in the slightest, but... They claimed less than a hundred people died during it?? There's probably a hundred people living on the bottom floor of one of those apartment complexes like a tenth of a mile from the explosion site!!! \n\nUtterly insane.",

Even one from the president of Colombia?\n\nIf true, glad they survived. 40 days is a long time. I haven't read much about the children outside of their ages, a baby is harder to keep alive, and that they are indigenous. The latter could give them a higher advantage than most, considering their people have lived there for many thousands of years.",

The oldest child, a teenager would have had some knowledge of living off the land. How they survived the crash is the amazing part and how they cared for the youngest survivor is truly remarkable.",

Many 13 year olds would have trouble caring for an infant in a major city. \n\nI can't even imagine the ordeals they had to face and overcome.

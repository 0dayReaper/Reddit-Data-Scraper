[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1.

It outlined a massive conspiracy that even tried to go really deep into Navy culture, and failed absolutely miserably. It was one of the worst pieces of absolute fiction that I'd ever read. But people EVERYWHERE in the world ate it up. \n\nI find it *highly* amusing that Russia likely got its pipeline blown up by six Ukrainians in a boat. Little hard for them to get upset about it publicly, when they so badly wanted it to be 'Dyadya Sam' and the 'deepstate'.",

Meaning that the ship needs to probably do the trip twice to get all of it there. \n\nAlso keep in mind that since Europe is the one buying, it alone can't fill the ship with something else as America already had plenty of oil themselves. So I bet that the ship goes back empty.\n\nNow this might not be exactly as how things go, but it is my closest guess that this time your statement is false.",

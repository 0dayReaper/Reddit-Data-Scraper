In NZ we're over ~~4000~~ 2000 km from our closest neighbour and 12,000 km+ away from epicentres like the US and Europe. You can drive under the sea that separates Britain and France. It's a bit different\n\nThat being said, I agree with the underlying point, that it isn't necessary to be an island and beat off covid. It probably helps, I reckon, but there are other examples like Vietnam who have done exceptionally well with multiple land borders and rather high population density.",

I live in the Philippines which is made up of many islands and that hasn\u2019t helped at all.\nIt comes down to competency of government and the people\u2019s willingness to comply. Other countries that are not islands are doing well, too. As for countries with states/provinces, those have shut down their borders and effectively dealt with the virus within those borders. The United States is split up into states - this could have been easily managed per state were it not for the people and what amounts to the most useless government on earth.",

When the cases come out, they spiked pretty quickly because the first people who had it went to work and church without knowing. \n\nOur PM put the whole country into level 2 (social distancing, masks on public transport, seated service in bars/restaurants maximum of 100 people capacity) for precautionary measures. The Auckland region went into level 3, which is almost full lockdown with an extended bubble.\n\nThe country has been fantastic at contact tracing, we have a really good app and all businesses were required to have the QR code upon entry and were VERY strict on everyone using it. I think this saved A LOT of spreading with contacts being told to isolate if there had been a case recently.\n\nI live in Nelson, which is in the South Island, so I am an average Joe. Life was almost normal with a lot of social distancing, usage of the app and tamer nights out. Now, everything is normal, with usage of the app, because you never know!",

Remember that during this second 'season' we had a few cases outside this main cluster from MIQ workers and they were quickly stamped out (in one case, the maintenance worker, before spreading to anyone else at all). Contact tracing has really levelled up during this 'season' and we have a few more tools in the toolbox now too (moving infected and close contacts into MIQ).  \n\n\nWe will have more cases eventually but I feel pretty comfortable that it will be handled even better than this time",

In fact the vast majority of infections in Thailand are from returning Thai citizens or foreigners who were diagnosed and quarantined immediately upon arrival. There is no overwhelming national strategy, people walk around without masks everywhere, even gyms, bars and restaurants. Only exception is inside shopping malls and grocery stores masks must be worn. Pretty simple policy, but effective.",

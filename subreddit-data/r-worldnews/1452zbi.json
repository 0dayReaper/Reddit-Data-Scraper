Or having second homes being empty.\n\nThe cost of a 3 bed house now is roughly the cost of a 3-bed house tomorrow and yesterday, and all things being equal if you sell a house you can only really afford one the same - same kind of area, desirability, size, facilities.  \n\nWhat that number is may change, but the actual houses don't.\n\nUnless you downsize, or significantly increase the desirability of your house (e.g. add an extension), the house doesn't change.\n\nFact is, we stopped building houses and there is nothing on the horizon to penalise homeowners or corporations sucking up lots of property for one person.  We're about one generation away from most people not being able to afford a house.\n\nEven a house crash - so everyone buys a cheap house.  Great.  Now what?  House prices will go back up.  Now you have to decide to sell the house but you'll over ever get... the same size house.  Or you can live in it and pay it off and start to own it.  But, still, same effect.  To realise the value, you have to sell up and buy another house.  Except it's no longer in a crash now, right?  In fact, you might be lumbered with a house you can't find a buyer for, hence can't sell, hence can't realise.\n\nIn just a couple of generations we've screwed housing and put everyone in a dead-end of needing/wanting a house, but there simply not being enough, and any housing crash doesn't really change much because we're just stuck in an ever-shrinking cul-de-sac because we're not building.\n\nNot only are we building fewer homes, we're building smaller ones, we're building less desirable ones, and we're building them to be rented, not sold.  What would be a row of 3-bed semi-detached town houses, back to back, with gardens and drives fifty years ago is now an estate crammed into any brownfield, filled with cheap plasterboard flats with allocated parking, homeowner's associations breathing down your neck, and families left, right, above, below, in front and behind you.\n\nI bought my last house last year.  Have bought three houses in my lifetime, this one was just for me, to get me through to retirement, a last-gasp at actually owning a property for a significant length of time while mortgage companies will still let me.  It's the smallest (1 bed), most rural (not a good thing for work!), most expensive per-square-metre, least desirable of all the ones I've owned.  No garden to speak of.  No possibility of extension, loft conversion or anything like that.\n\nAt this point, 6 months in, it's already gone up more than 10% judging by local sales.  But it doesn't matter - because I can't ever sell it because that would basically mean renting again, into and post-retirement.  Bye, bye any kind of pension (which won't cover my electricity bill by then, let alone rent).  I doubt I'd ever be able to get even a similar house on my own ever again even if I sold it.\n\nUntil we fix housing - rent controls, high taxation of rental income, heavily penalising empty properties, building 10 to 100 times more houses than we are each year - my yet-to-be-born grandchild will never own a home.  Or probably even land of any kind.",

The joys of making your economy dependent on leverage to buy assets.\n\nBuy home for 350k, with 20% down payment (70k). Initially have 70k equity, and monthly payments at \u00a31750. Thats 0.5% of total a month.  Imagine interest rate was 0.5% at this time per year.\nThen imagine interest rate became 5% a year, potentially making monthly payments required \u00a32500. Now imagine the house price falls to 300k, about 15% less.\nYour home equity is now only 59k. You lost money on your down payment. You cannot afford to pay monthly fee anymore, so need to sell the home to pay off mortgage. The home sells for 300k. You get 60k about, bank gets 240k. You owe the bank 40k still however. You give them it from your equity and are left with 20k. Your initial down was 70k, resulting in a large loss.\n\nNow imagine this with a 5% down. Bankrupt.",

House prices that go up along with earnings aren't really causing the problems I point out, but if **as a proportion of earnings** they grow then they do start pulling back the rest of the Economy and creating all manner of Social problems.\n\n2 -\n\nThe way the Official GDP is calculated in Britain uses the CPI (so, the inflation index without Housing Inflation) rather than the CPIH (the one with Housing Inflation) to deflate it from the Nominal GDP, so house price inflation pumps up the British Official GDP figures, making them look better, as if an inflationary increase in the trading price of houses that have not been improved in any way, just flipped, is genuine wealth creation. It also means that the trading price of houses falling results in a fall of an Official GDP calculated in that way.",

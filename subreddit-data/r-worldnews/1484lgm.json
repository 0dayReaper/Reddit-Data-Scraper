By April, it had acquired a fleet of 58 vessels with an estimated combined value of $1.6bn, according to shipping experts VesselsValue.\n\nYet the origins and ownership of the business are a mystery, while its corporate records are scant. The group was registered as an exporter in India on March 31 this year but does not appear in India\u2019s official corporate registry.\n\nOne important clue is that Gatik shares an address in the dreary shopping mall with Mumbai-registered company Buena Vista Shipping, another little-known operation that two years ago reported just over $100,000 worth of assets.\n\nWho really owns Buena Vista Shipping and who funded the rapid expansion of Gatik\u2019s fleet has perplexed the oil market. But shipbrokers, analysts and commodity traders suspect a link with its biggest client: the Russian oil giant Rosneft.\n\nGatik\u2019s newly acquired fleet has been used largely to transport oil from Russia, mainly to ports in India, tanker tracking data shows. A Financial Times analysis of data from Kpler, an analytics company, shows the Indian group has shipped at least 83mn barrels of Russian crude and oil products \u2014 enough to meet total UK oil demand for more than two months. More than half of that has come from Rosneft. Total figures are believed to be even larger than those in Kpler\u2019s data set.\n\n\u201cIt was inevitable after the west\u2019s sanctions that the Russian oil companies would want to get into shipping and I think Gatik is the ultimate example of this happening,\u201d said Viktor Katona, head of crude analysis at Kpler.\n\n\u201cA company in a country that\u2019s deemed friendly to the Russian state, pops up out of nowhere, buys a tremendous amount of tankers in less than a year, and is almost exclusively servicing Russian flows.\u201d\n\nWestern sanctions on Russian oil exports in response to Vladimir Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 have completely reshaped global oil markets. Rosneft, the Kremlin-controlled oil champion and Russia\u2019s biggest producer, has been at the eye of the storm. Igor Sechin, its chief executive and a close Putin ally, is one of the Kremlin\u2019s most hawkish and hardline figures \u2014 earning him the nickname Darth Vader.\n\nThe EU has imposed a series of restrictions on Russian crude, most recently a price cap on oil handled by European companies; Rosneft\u2019s largest customers, Trafigura and Vitol, ditched their agreements with it last year. Following the sanctions, New Delhi has opted to increase its imports of Russian oil, rather than itself imposing sanctions or observing a price cap imposed by the G7.\n\nThat is the context in which Gatik emerged. VesselsValue, which tracks tanker sales, calculates that Gatik has acquired at least 56 vessels since March 2022, including 13 in December alone when the EU\u2019s embargo on Russian oil began.\n\nThe purchases put Gatik among the largest tanker owners in the world, according to VesselsValue\u2019s Rebecca Galanopoulos. \u201cTo put this into perspective, out of almost 14,000 live tankers, the majority of these companies \u2014 1,361 \u2014 own fewer than 10 live tankers; only 20 companies, including Gatik, own 50 or more.\u201d\n\nThe vessels have also faded into the shadows. As recently as late March, at least 35 of Gatik\u2019s ships held western insurance \u2014 a condition of which is adherence to the G7 price cap on Russian oil sales imposed from last December.\n\nBy early April, however, none of Gatik\u2019s ships held insurance from any of the recognised large mutual providers.\n\nThe ageing vessels in Gatik\u2019s growing fleet had previously transported crude oil all over the world, shipping records show. Once acquired by the Indian group, they started to focus heavily on the Russia-India run.\n\nIn doing so, Gatik, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in Sanskrit, has helped facilitate one of the most significant shifts in oil flows in decades. Before the Ukraine war, Russia supplied less than 1 per cent of India\u2019s crude. It now accounts for about 30 per cent, according to official trade statistics.\n\nNew Delhi has not publicly rebuked Russia over the invasion and in return has benefited from millions of barrels of Russian oil, often sold at a heavier discount than to other buyers.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the oil bought by India cost $48.03 per barrel before shipping \u2014 $10 less than the average paid by other countries, according to Kyiv School of Economics research based on Russian oil sale records.\n\nThrough such deals, India has absorbed most of the so-called Urals crude that Russia previously exported to the EU market. However, some Indian refineries have complained that the heavy Russian blend has been clogging old refinery equipment, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn response, Rosneft\u2019s Sechin in March signed a deal with the Indian Oil Corporation, the country\u2019s top refiner, to increase oil exports to India further and \u201cdiversify its blends\u201d. Rosneft was the only Russian oil company with a presence in India before the war owing to its stake in the Nayara refinery in Gujarat, noted Kpler\u2019s Katona. \u201cThey already had a foot in the country and they understand how business is done,\u201d he said.\n\nThe exact nature of the relationship between Gatik and Rosneft is unclear: Buena Vista, where a staff member said Gatik was \u201cpart of\u201d the group, declined to respond to the FT\u2019s queries. But the relationship is clearly close.\n\nIndian officials involved in buying oil for their refineries have told the FT that they have dealt directly with Rosneft \u2014 not via intermediaries. The cargoes are also now sold on a \u201ccost, insurance, and freight\u201d basis \u2014 meaning Rosneft is responsible for the delivery of the crude to the destination port in India \u2014 rather than the \u201cFree On Board\u201d basis Rosneft preferred before the war, when the buyer organised the shipping.\n\nSechin, a bon vivant fond of wine, hunting and jazz, is widely feared in Moscow for his ties to the security services. A former army translator who speaks fluent Spanish and Portuguese, Sechin has built Rosneft into an effective tool for Russia\u2019s foreign policy abroad. But the sanctions against the company have created challenges for its role as Russia\u2019s top oil exporter.\n\n\nGoing into the war, Rosneft lacked a significant fleet of its own, relying on buyers to move its oil. It made a brief attempt to build tankers in 2014 with the Russian manufacturer Zvezda but the project made little progress, in part because Rosneft never believed the west would risk disrupting global oil flows by blocking Russia\u2019s access to shipping, a person close to Rosneft told the FT.\n\nBut the sanctions and restrictions meant Rosneft and other Russian producers not only needed to find new customers but ships to transport the oil. As the prices paid for shipping Russian oil rose, a global \u201cghost fleet\u201d of opaquely owned vessels willing to risk sanctions grew to serve this lucrative new market.\n\nIn Mumbai, visits to the Indian companies\u2019 offices provide few additional answers on Gatik and Buena Vista. At the former given address for both companies in the mall, post addressed to the mysterious company was piled on the floor. Many shipping companies base themselves at the Neptune Magnet Mall.\n\nOn March 31, Gatik Ship Management used the abandoned office\u2019s mall address when it registered as a merchant exporter with India\u2019s Directorate General of Foreign Trade.\n\n\nRecently, Buena Vista has relocated to a new gleaming development in one of the city\u2019s wealthier suburbs that sits next to a lake. An employee confirmed Gatik was \u201cpart of\u201d the group before declining to answer further questions. Management wanted to keep a \u201clow profile\u201d, the person said.\n\nBuena Vista did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBuena Vista\u2019s registered directors are two Indian nationals, Umesh Suvarna Vasu and John Pinto Agnelo, and the company also has an office in Dubai. Nautical job boards show the company recruiting for a variety of roles in the past year, including chief cooks and oilers. People at the mall that housed Buena Vista\u2019s old office said the company had been recruiting heavily before it relocated.\n\nAll but two of Gatik\u2019s vessels are registered to single-vessel companies registered in the Marshall Islands and the ownership of those companies is not public.\n\nHowever, in a 2016 article in Russian Pioneer magazine on his love of jazz, Sechin waxed lyrical about one of his favourite bands, the \u201cmagnificent\u201d Cuban son orchestra, the Buena Vista Social Club.\n\nWhether by coincidence or by design, one of the vessels in Gatik\u2019s fleet is called the Buena Vista. The name of its registered owner in the Marshall Islands: Social Club Inc.\n\nAdditional reporting by David Sheppard and Max Seddon",

It'll poison a lot of the fauna and flora.\n\nWhat it'll also do is cause a bunch of microbes and algae to flourish. Good thing that Siberia is also sweltering through an extremely hot summer so far... you know, perfect conditions for microbes and algae. Where that becomes a problem is that algae and microbes can consume a lot of oxygen out of the water, but also don't need a lot of oxygen to survive. Meaning they'll likely just cause all the remaining fish species to suffocate, and completely destroy the life cycle of a major section of rivers.\n\nThen you have the 'downstream' effects. Benzene will cause cancer rates to go through the roof of anyone who relies on the waterways for drinking.\n\nThere won't be any serious remediation efforts either. Russia considers the Far East as little more than a colony; places to extract resources from and from which to project power. A lot of the ethnic minorities in those areas are barely considered to be Russian. Peoples like the Tuvans and Khakas.",

I wrote an article presenting my assessment of events. Prosecuting me for that violates the Constitution.&amp;quot;Secondly, what is happening in Ukraine - let&amp;#039;s be clear and call it a war - it is against the interests of Russia and Russian citizens.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/14584il/ukraine_war_oleg_orlov_faces_jail_time_for/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688351 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Russian**^#1 **war**^#2 **Ukraine**^#3 **Orlov**^#4 **Russia**^#5",

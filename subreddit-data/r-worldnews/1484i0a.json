[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The base is close enough for a fast response. Any threat to the canal would likely be coming out the strait which is even closer, and the canal itself is alreasy protected by Egypt, while the other end has no choicepoint and is close enough for response our of Europe. Out of all the countries bordering the strait Djibouti is the most stable which in turn makes it an ideal candidate for a foreign base. It immediately controls the strait of bab el mandeb which is the biggest choicepoint for traffic crossing the canal. For a deeper dive into the strategic significance of Djibouti for both this and missions to neighbouring countries you can just Google it, because there is a lot of interesting informatio  there to read.",

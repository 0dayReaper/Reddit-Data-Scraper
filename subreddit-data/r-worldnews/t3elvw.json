On places aligned more towards one side of the conflict, like Reddit for example, it is difficult to get information about progress of the opposing side. You really have to comb through niche subreddits to find shreds of info how russians are reaching their targets (if they do, that is). Any attempt at doing so will result with your post being downvoted. This is unfortunate, but it is the reality. As a result what you see on reddit (and other media types, for that matter, it's not exclusive to reddit) is heavily one-sided as people don't really like hearing small successes of the side they oppose, even though this information might be objectively truth. \n\nBoth sides of this conflict release huge number of propaganda, it is extremely difficult to tell which ones are truthful, which ones are maliciously misleading, which ones are simply incorrect due to lack of info and fog of war.\n\nIt does seem that the Ukrainians are doing fairly well, and by God I wish they repel their enemy until the cease-fire is signed, at least. However, I'm a bit worried that we silently don't hear too much about Russian progress in the east. I'm worried they will create a corridor from Kharkiv through Dniepro to Odessa effectively cutting off the eastern Ukrainian fighters from supplies and giving them control of Donetsk and Luhansk oblast alongside additional ground in the east including Kharkiv itself.\n\nHowever, I'm just a random programmer that know fuck all about warfare. You should not believe anyone on reddit or any other social media, 99% of us knows fuck all. Even those that were in the military look at it through a looking glass and think they know what they're saying. They do not. Belive nothing, gather as much info from opposing sides as possible and try to make conclusions on your own.",

I used it during the 2011 war in Libya to see which towns had reports of which side was dominant there, or any, and it was easier and more detailed than waiting for big updates from the BBC etc. \n\nThe unfortunate truth is that Ukraine is showing great spirit and putting up stuff resistance\u2026 but the Russians are overwhelmingly more numerous, many times better equipped, and within a few days have made massive progress. Their several prongs of invasion have merged into three (EDIT: two the last few hours) and the Russian force coming in from Belarus is right outside Kiev with another force from the east pushing rapidly westwards to it. They\u2019re right outside Kharkiv, too.",

If they show that they act humanely, it softens resistance to surrender.\n\nPart of what sped Europe into war in world war I was that the Germans committed numerous atrocities in Belgium, right at the beginning of the war.  After that, it was impossible for the Allies to negotiate and allow those atrocities to go unpunished.",

This isn't to say these things aren't happening, just that how they've been presented to us does serve a narrative purpose. \n\nWe have to be very careful how invested we get in the stories we want to hear or else we're going to wake up one day to news wholly incongruous with what we \"know\" and be completely lost to truth.",

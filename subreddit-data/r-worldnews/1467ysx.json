            "comment": "I doubt Putin will live to see any aftermath to his insanity. I think there's a very small chance he won't be assassinated by other Russians. And Russia will do this as an act of self-preservation. Ending Putin gives them at least a way to ask for leniency, presuming that goes hand in hand with the immediate and complete withdrawal of their forces from Crimea, and the rest of Ukraine. \n\nPutin is destroying Russia as surely as he thought he was going to destroy Ukraine. After this is over, Russia will need to go hat in hand to the International Community , and it's anyone's guess how that will go. A lot will depend on their attitude , willingness to provide access , and recognition that they are in fact responsible. I think it's unlikely Russia will retain complete ownership or control of valuable resources. \n\nThey really will be in a very bad condition afterwards, and they really will also need to provide reparations. It's questionable if Russia could possibly stay together under these circumstances. \n\nI think it will break up, because a number of areas will declare their independence. Having that huge, autocratic presence gone is going to result in a potential gold mine for both NATO and the EU, and I'm guessing not without some potentially disastrous consequences. Avoiding a series of Wars of Independence might not be possible. And there's never a shortage of dictator wannabes who will try to step into any such vacuum.",

Gets shot several times (even now) with artillery\n\nRussia: pulls out heavy infantry and vehicles, doesn't inform their light infantry, left them to die and uses them to blame Ukraine for the dam collapse. Does nothing for the people living there unless they have russian passports, doesn't even allow the UN in to help people, despite chairing the UN security council...\n\nBut don't you dare call it a genocide...\n\nLike others have said both on here and on other social media sites (mostly twitter), russia knows they can't win this war, putin knows this but can't tell that to his country so he decides to throw as many russians into the meat grinder to cause as much harm to Ukraine in the process (soldiers dying while liberating their country, random shelling of villages, killing of local population,..)\n\nIt's hitler all over again but more destructive",

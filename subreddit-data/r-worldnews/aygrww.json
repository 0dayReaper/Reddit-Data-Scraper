Last one I dealt with was between a company that makes apnoea masks and the organisation that provided the funding for the development of the patent. Apnoea mask company didn't honor the licensing stipulation. 25 million dollarydoos later = don't fuck with the grant agreement.\n\nEdit: I'm getting messages asking for money now. Just to clarify, I wasn't one of the claimants or respondents, I'm one of the staff who handles contracts. Just an average wage guy earning his dollarydoooooos",

After all, you're a genius and this is your chosen field, surely you'll be able to turn things around before anyone notices.\n\nSo yeah, I'm actually not at all surprised to find that kind of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for the CEO of this company.",

Apple was the only other guy in town and they were headed for bankruptcy quick. Bill bailed them out so they wouldn\u2019t go under. Thus there was a remaining competitior and and Microsoft was never prosecuted for anti-trust as a result. Kind of backfired on him a little bit maybe not. Microsoft could be 5 different companies now had he not done this. ",

Wonder if the more generous ones should be spending their money to bribe, I mean lobby the government for change vs just doing it themselves. Might be more effective. ",

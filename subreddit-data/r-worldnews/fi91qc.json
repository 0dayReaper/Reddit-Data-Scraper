I stopped to eat at a diner on my way back and just before I stepped in  I got a call from my dad telling me that the towers were gone. I could not comprehend what he was saying and got off the phone quickly so I could walk into the restaurant. Stepping in, I noticed that everyone was dead silent and that NPR was playing loudly over the sound system. I heard the details then.\n\n As surreal as that was, it still did not really sink in until I watched the playbacks on TV when I got home.",

So now about 80% of their work is done in the US for people that cannot afford healthcare. \n\nSo yes, we have come to a point where the US needs NGO groups to treat Americans because we cannot afford it.",

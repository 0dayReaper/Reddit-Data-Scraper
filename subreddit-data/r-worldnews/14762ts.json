His analysis is great, his predictions are often a bit shortsighted. A lot of them are based on if nothing changes. He already had to walk back some of his predictions due to things like technological advancements moving faster than expected and the NATO alliance being more resilient than he expected.\n\nHis analysis of current situations are great to understand the current state of the world. Just take the predictions with a large grain of salt.",

They've been thinking about that for a long time, that's why places like Dubai, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have been diversifying their economies with a financial services sector, high tech agriculture, as well as massive investments into Europe, the US, and yes now China as well. \n\nPeople always point to Japan as to what happens when an ascending superpower collapses and act like after 1989 Japan turned into a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Japan still continued to be one of the wealthiest and most highly developed countries in the world even after their lost decades. \n\nEven if China loses half their population, they will still be the 2nd most populous country in the world, which is exactly where they are today. And the parts of China that actually matter, i.e. the big cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, even HK, will always have an infinite supply of workforce wanting to move there. The rural areas will become more rural, but the urban cities that are driving China's development will continue to grow as normal.\n\nI think people need to understand that when these organizations make these predictions, they're intending to provide useful data to investors and corporations. Of course China declining is going to be important information to capitalists, so they can make important decisions about moving production to India or Vietnam, and move their investments to wherever the next big growth spot will be. The issue is when the average Joe reads these predictions and thinks that China's decline is going to impact them in any significant way. \n\nPeople have been worried about China's economy for a good few years now, and guess what? The major problem going on today in the world has nothing to do with China - it's the war in Ukraine, which is something that nobody was able to predict. It's likely that long before China has significantly declined there will have been several other global impacts like the Ukraine war that will be far more important than China's economic slowdown.",

The math of demographic collapse is very simple. Even if the Chinese tripled their birth rate (which they can't do because of gender imbalances, socioeconomics, etc.), it takes at least 18 years for the next generation to reproduce. So turning around the effects of One Child would take multiple generations. This is not a 50 year project.\n2. China is a middle income country, not a high income country. Every day that passes it becomes more likely that it will be forever stuck in the middle income trap. Even if it wanted to, it's not rich enough to import people (immigration).",

Today, we import less than a third of the oil we imported from Saudi in 2000.\n\nThere is an oil consideration because oil is a global market. Even if we imported 0 barrels from Saudi, they still have a big enough slice of the market (and influence in OPEC) to manipulate global oil prices. That of course affects American oil producers and consumers.\n\nBut there's more to it than just that. The shitty \"alliance\" between the US and House of Saud is also about regional political BS, and historical issues that arguably are no longer as important but that we've staked positions that have been heavily invested in and are thus hard to change.",

It, like almost everyone else, freeloads off the US-led security apparatus.\n\nIf Atlas shrugs, the post-WW2 global order goes away and the US isn't willing to let that happen. Perhaps for good reason. It's a shitty dilemma when you're providing security for states that are, if not totally evil, have interests counter to yours.\n\nAs for the USD, the Saudi riyal has been pegged to the USD since 1986.

Later by 80 DPRK built a second one and making fuel rods and collecting plutonium but still not clear about how to make a weapon.\n\nIn early 80s DPRK got scud missiles from Egypt as Russia won't sell them directly. Based on these, DPRK made good missile program and developed SRBM, MRBM and ICBMs.\n\nDuring same time AQ Khan, stole URENCO Dutch centrifuge blueprints, buying German gas centrifuges and with help of China started building Pakistan nuclear weapons program. After India's 1998 nuclear tests, Pakistan immediately conducted it's nuclear tests and declared itself as nuclear state, so did DPRK.\n\nThough Pakistan had a weapon, it is missing delivery system. In late 90s and early 2000s with China's mediation and help both Pakistan and DPRK exchanged their technologies and made themselves complete with weapon and delivery systems.\n\nEarly 2000s is an interesting times, few countries started signing on and off NPT treaty and lot of IAEA inspections happened around the world.\n\nAQ Khan and KRL started international black market for nuclear weapons. They started selling centrifuges and nuclear enrichment program, helping build nuclear weapons in Egypt, Libya and Iran. Though it failed in Egypt and Libya it succeeded in Iran. Stuxnet, US Iran deal and later events are now well known.",

However, it's not surprising given the current political climate and the shifting power dynamics in the Middle East.

            "comment": "The reality is that America buys almost nothing from Saudi these days. China and India are their biggest customers. With shale oil we are now a major exportor these days. We have become mostly self sufficient. \nHere is how much we care these days. A couple ships in the Suez Canal got taken and how much of a finger did we lift. USA isn't really interested in protecting them or the worlds trade routes any more. Ignore the words and watch the actual actions. I have been enjoying the show, and continue to watch the show/drama unfolding. Look up Peter Ziehan and listen to the man. Joe Blogs, and Tony on China Update.",

( Half) joking aside, countries don't have friends they have interests. The US is the first example of that, dumping supposed friends time and time again. \nThere is this view in the US that America is a great benefactor to the world. It's not the most evil empire but it is an empire and it benefits from that world order by several orders of magnitude: just look at the benefits of the US dollar as major international reserve currency. Truth is, the USA's combined levels of public and private debt (due to government and households living way beyond their means) would trigger restructuring, default and IMF rule in any other country. The US dollar's unique standing has prevented that from happening. \nThe US has to learn to adjust to an evolving world order, and its debt is going to be a major issue one day or the other. The US does need friends or whatever you may want to call them.",

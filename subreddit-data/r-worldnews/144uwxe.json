Took them less than a hundred years to destroy one of the largest inland sea's on the face of the planet, and turn into a desert. And now, said desert climate is increasing the water evaporation of the river, that used feed it, now also dooming the former Soviet cotton plantations in Central Asia, due to lack of water reaching it from the rapidly drying river. Not the mention the huge dust and salt storms containing pesticides, that now plague the area. The Soviets also had the bright idea to build a biological weapons factory, called Aralsk-7, on what used to be an island in the former Aral Sea. So those storms also carry remnants of chemical and biological weapons. Smallpox, Anthrax spores and bubonic plague for example. \n\nWhen you mess with nature on this level, there is always permanent consequences.",

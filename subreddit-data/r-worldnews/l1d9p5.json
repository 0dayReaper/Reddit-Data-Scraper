But they believe (I assume) the election was rigged and stolen, which isn't really based in practices of democracy but rather an emotional attachment to the people and ideas telling them it was stolen. I'm not sure any amount of political education would sway the people that far down the rabbit hole. \n  \nEducation is still key, I just think it needs to be a complete overhaul where kids are taught about critical thinking, spotting actual fake news and propaganda online, checking multiple sources of information etc. starting in middle school and continuing throughout. Less curriculum that isn't actually applicable for most in adulthood and more practical, but critical, real life shit. The internet is wild and we don't prepare young people enough. Unfortunately the older ones are mostly in the grips.",

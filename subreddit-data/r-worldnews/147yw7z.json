The embargo has been reprimanded *every year* by UN General assembly resolutin since 1990's. Vote, whole world vs USA and Israel.\n\n There is exactly zero onus on Cuba to make nice to get USA to lift the embargo. USA should lift the sanctions, because it is illegal, unjustified and unfair regime. Until then USA has no room to complain about any retaliatory actions Cuba takes. This isn't diplomatic bargaining matter. USA is categorically wrong on this one. Trade deals you bargain and make nice over. This, this is just plain USA doing illegal stuff.",

They came to agreements with every country except the one with the largest number of foreign property owners -- the USA.  They were in negotiations to come to a settlement agreement when the USA basically cut off trade with Cuba, forcing them to turn to the Soviet Union for help.\n\nSome of these claims have changed hands so many times it's absurd.  The single largest claim, for example is held by Office Depot, who acquired it through various corporate mergers.",

It doesn't excuse our actions and past foreign policy decisions, but during the Cold War especially, everyone was doing horrible stuff to interfere and meddle. We should lift the embargo, mend the fence so to speak and let go of that old grudge. We are in a new Cold War, primarily with China, but also Russia too. It's not exactly like the old one, but it does have some similarities.",

Geopolitically, control of Crimea is incredibly important to Russia. The recent invasion was to obtain a land bridge to solve logistics issues supplying Crimea with things like water and food, since they only had one railway and a single highway for that purpose and Ukraine had cut off fresh water to the region after Russia annexed it. If Ukraine became a NATO nation, obtaining that land bridge becomes impossible.\n\nSo in that sense, Ukraine joining NATO was a trigger to the Russian invasion. However, the invasion would have come even if Ukraine wasn\u2019t attempting to join NATO. Furthermore, Ukraine likely wouldn\u2019t have sought NATO membership if Crimea hadn\u2019t been invaded. So the whole situation came down to Russia\u2019s goals in the Black Sea. They annexed Crimea, creating the political leanings toward NATO when Ukraine\u2019s government was previously more neutral. Then used those political leanings as a justification to invade while really just trying to solve the logistical issues facing their control over Crimea.",

China is literally stealing land from neighbours and there's multiple open territorial disputes because China is trying to make wild claims for land and sea that doesn't belong to them. I'm only in my 30s and Russia has invaded and stole land from multiple neighbours in my life time. The \"legitimate separatist\" claim is inaccurate at best and does not justify their actions considering Russia plants the separatists and uses it as a weak excuse to take more land. 2022 is post 2013 and Russia tried to take Kyiv but their special forces all ended up dead or captured in a hilarious display of Russian military incompetence. Trying to take Kyiv doesn't match your \"separatist\" claim.\n\n\nPerhaps spend less time trying to learn reasons to hate the USA and spend some more time learning why Russia and China are hated by all their neighbours. Perhaps learning why NATO exists might help you not make wildly inaccurate Whataboutisms.",

Glass is far less harmful to the environment (to the rest of nature it's just an igneous rock with an odd shape and strange optical properties), and the raw materials for it make up the majority of the Earth's crust (so we're not likely to run out of them anytime soon).\n\nSo the question comes up whether it's cost-effective to implement glass recycling when the same money could be spent dealing with plastics that are far more harmful.",

And when i say burned, about one third of that is exported to Sweden and Estonia, who knows if that ends up actually in the burner as its claimed.",

You buy a 24 bottle crate (perfect quantity)  and pay a 4 euro rent-fee for the crate. You drink the beers and once you're done instead of throwing them away you conveniently place them back in the crate. Once you've drunk all 24 you bring the crate back to the supermarket and get you 4 euros back. Why can't they implement this system everywhere on every drink? It'd be so easy and it would reduce plastic waste dramatically!",

So let's say you buy beer at store 1, soda at store 2 and a sports drink at store 3. When you go to do your redemption, you can't just take it all to one place, you have to go back to each place you bought the item from for the return. It's less time to just toss it in the recycling bin and eat the redemption. \n\nWhat's worse is that during covid they stopped redemption for months, but still charged the fees. \n\nAlso a lot of stores will charge redemption fees but not actually take back the recycling. \n\nIt's really not implemented well here at all.",

It will take you hours and must be done during business hours just to return a small amount of bottles. I've spent 3 hours before returning a car load of bottles only to get about $10. And that's not including time spent driving to the store and gas to get there. My time is worth more than that. If only grocery stores accepted bottles then this would all make sense. Some did before covid and that was a great discovery but the majority did not and now none do. So I've just been tossing the lot into trash and trying to avoid buying CRV deposit products when possible.",

You can still recycle the glass bottles but the kind of glass bottles that you pay a deposit for and get back are slowly vanishing from the stores. Left are the glass bottles that don't have a deposit and is recycled in a special wheelie bin for glass. Less people will recycle if you don't get money back. (Although swedes are luckily pretty good at recycling because people will look down at you if you don't) . Why they are removing the glass bottles with a deposit I have no idea",

Madness. \n\nMeanwhile where I work (packaging foam company) we now sell a raspberry ripple material. We used to put so much effort into making our material.as white as possinle, and our recycled material a consistent grey. But we then found our customers don't really care. You could now get a block of foam where it starts of blue, goes purple, then goes black. Our customers can't get enough of it. It functions identically, can still be recycled, and is an extremely visible way of (greenwa*h**g) while actually doing a tiny tiny bit of good.\n\nAnd the best part? It means we aren't having to purge loads of material through the machines when we do change from one colour to another. Yes that purged material would get shredded anyway and put straight back in to the next recycled batch, but it now means the energy, time, and money that would be wasted on the purge goes straight into sellable product.\n\nCoke could save millions on packaging QA with choosing a recycled material which would naturally Woden QA targets for appearance!!!",

Or... the best option would not purchase these items at all.",

You can just as easily get a water filter that lasts 3-6 months, instead of cases and cases of bottled water. I've lived in cities with the cleanest water on the planet, and cities with really hard water, or underground water, and getting a Brita filter in the latter cities gave perfectly fine water.",

I personally only buy fruit syrup (in glass bottles) and mix it with tap water to have something to drink with taste sometimes but actually mostly drink tap water. Where I live only fancy expensive drinks are in glass bottles. (Budapest, Hungary).\n\nI know that there are alternatives, my point is what the average person looking for a drink sees when entering a shop. Shiny marketing, low prices and plastic everywhere. It's not fair to say that \"omg 90% of the people will still buy it\" when there are fewer alternatives which cost more than 90% of the stuff on shelves.",

I'm from Michigan, and you rarely see bottles as litter.  Charities will do collections for fundraisers. Homeless will collect them to get a few bucks.  At colleges, there are people that go to the tailgate party's and collect empty cans. One time I saw a family collecting together when I was in school. I asked him how much they collect. He said for the 6 or so Saturdays they go collect, they get enough to take the a family vacation to Disney in the winter.",

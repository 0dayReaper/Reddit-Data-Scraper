Functionalism, and recognising the peculiar needs of member states while trying to hold the collective to common standards where possible is why the EU has worked so well. This idea the U.K. got atypically special interests accommodated by the EU is simply not true.",

There was nothing 'special' about it, and there'd be no reason for it to exist on rejoining anyway\n\nEU contributions are set according to a formula. The UK would simply rejoin on those terms. It's that straight forward\n\nWhen the UK joined originally, all the member states of the then Common Market were in favour of it other than France. The French vetoed it. For a few years after, negotiations took place and the French eventually decided to support the UK but only on condition that they made an unreasonably large contribution to subsidise the common agricultural policy (principal beneficiary being France)\n\nThe UK agreed, as they calculated that the benefits of joining (even with a punitive contribution to the budget) outweighed the down side of not doing\n\nAs the EEC expanded and new member states joined with nothing like the same unreasonable terms the UK's contribution became a source of resentment, and increasingly embarrassment on the EEC's side too\n\nEventually Brussels had to concede that the UK's contribution was unfair and that it needing correcting. This would involve a change to the treaty however and terms that the UK entered under (a major headache, fraught with potential problems)\n\nInstead, it became much easier for all concerned for the UK to continue paying the over-inflated amount and for the EU to then send them a rebate on it so as to establish the correct level of contribution. This mechanism avoided all the issues of renegotiating a treaty \n\nIf the French had agreed to the correct level of contribution in 1973, none of this would have been necessary\n\nAll that would happen if they rejoined then is that the correct level of contribution would be set at the point of entry and no rebate would be necessary",

There never was any serious Cornish or Welsh independence movement and Northern Ireland still wants to remain part of the UK. Scottish independence has cooled down massively after the SNP was caught in their current clusterfuck.\n\nThe economically insignificant island of the UK is still the second largest economy in Europe and has managed to weather the pandemic and cost-of-living crisis better than Germany, considering the latter is now experiencing a recession. If we\u2019re being realistic, the EU would be happy to welcome the UK back on less stringent terms so long as there was a clause that forced the UK to remain in the union for at least a certain period of time. The UK was one of the biggest contributors to the budget and with them gone, the burden has fallen even more on the contributors.\n\nIf the choice was between accepting the UK back into the EU under the condition they don\u2019t adopt the Euro but they have to remain in for at least 20 years, I\u2019m sure the EU would seriously consider it. The GBP is the oldest currency that\u2019s still used on the planet and there\u2019s not a chance in hell the UK is dropping it. But don\u2019t think that the EU wouldn\u2019t like to have the UK back in, if not for anything other than their large budget contribution.",

To make it worse, european labor doesn't easily migrate. It's half centralized and half decentralized and gets a bit of the worst of each.\n\nThe result is fiscal and monetary policy can diverge so a country goes into depression/financial crisis and requires loose monetary policy or for its unemployed workers to move to somewhere with a better economy, but neither thing happens so you get an unnaturally long depression and a generation of people idled.",

I would also imagine the U.K. rejoining may be nonetheless given special treatment on the currency issue as London and the pound play an important role in clearing and currency exchange for European banks, and the pound itself has utility there. Further, the structure of the U.K. economy would have a distorting effect on the Euro that would worsen the imbalance of its value for southern states, and reduce the benefits of the euro for Germany. U.K. joining the euro may therefore be of less benefit to the EU than having a U.K. with its separate currency back within the EU.",

Since DKK has been pegged to the Euro for years. Since maintaining a currency peg to the Euro is part of the initial stages of tranistioning to the currency.\n\nThe peg is arguably worse for Denmark in some ways than just getting the Euro. Since maintaining it causes issues like negative interest rates (even lower than the Eurozone had) causing housing bubbles etc. People don't even know wth they are voting for/against, much like with Brexit.",

So you\u2019re not really in the strong position you think you are\u2026\n\nEdit: Also, our economies are 2% larger since the pandemic while the UK is 0.5% smaller. So even with the recession we\u2019re still doing far better than the UK.",

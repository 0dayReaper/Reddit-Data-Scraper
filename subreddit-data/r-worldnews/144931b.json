Basically Zahir Shah mordenization targeted only urban areas\nOnly infrastructure projects in rural areas. So on a way, it was sort of Fedaualism. Afghanistan  is basically a set of natural mountain fortresses. And when combined with tribalism, it is literally a warlords paradise. In other words, feudalism is the only government that can work without using force, since if you piss the wrong guy in a valley/tribe/village, you get a warlord and an insurgency. So you need a way to keep all of these people happy or deal with them using brute force. Since Zahir Shah was still in exile 2001, US should have installed him as a king and created a council of tribal leaders as the government. Actually, they used such a council to gain support of the new government post invasion. They probably are not the most liberal but at least they will be fighting verbally instead which could have allowed the stability needed to develop.",

The war was extremely popular initially, but there were also strong reservations:\n\n&gt; The decision to attack Afghanistan specifically was similarly popular. In the early months of the fighting support for the war at times topped 90 percent. A November Washington Post/ABC News poll found 71 percent of Americans supported sending large numbers of troops into Afghanistan.\n\n&gt; However, even in the early days of the war, Americans harbored doubts about the chances of success and the potentially high price tag. A poll in late October 2001 found that only 28 percent of Americans were very confident that the United States could capture or kill bin Laden, Operation Enduring Freedom\u2019s primary goal. A November Gallup poll found that 87 percent of Americans thought the war would be long. When asked about the chance of causalities among U.S. troops in Afghanistan, 51 percent said they thought the number would likely be high. In mid-December, 80 percent of Americans said that they thought that the most difficult part of the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan had yet to come.\n\nSource: https://www.cfr.org/blog/us-war-afghanistan-twenty-years-public-opinion-then-and-now\n\nI point it out because I find the contrast between support and expectations interesting. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, there was this sense that America needed to do something big out of a sense of revenge/justice and to reaffirm their safety, but even then, they doubted the long-term payoff of their actions.\n\nOr to put it another way, they felt compelled by what happened to make moves they felt were on shaky ground.",

This is why it folded almost immediately after USA left - nobody stood in the way of Taliban. Politicians escaped with money, soldiers did not see it as their duty to fight against them. \n\nUnfortunately human greed is infinite but resources (be it labour, land, natural resources) are finite. Hence peace on a country scale is achieved by having power to defend itself. And the larger the scale the more sociopathic is our course of action. Individual person might be a highly empathethic individual to other people they know. But then you have corporations for instance and while they absolutely consist of good peaceful people they also commit decisions that are unethical and outright illegal (but because justice system is not going to issue any severe penalties it's just a cost of business). Hence why Nestle can kill people by denying them access to water for instance and why Chinese government can harvest Uyghurs for organs. \n\nGoing from there to military operations is really just one step further. The more detached we are from specific people and are operating on statistical level the easier it gets to make decisions that are utterly fucked up. \n\nIn this particular case described - it's worth to remember that Taliban are not nice friendly tolerant people. They are all up for removing rights of millions so they can have more power to themselves. And you can't \"peacefully\" protest against them, you will just get shot. Instead best solution is in fact to kill them one by one. Language of violence historically works **better** at bringing the change than peaceful protests as it puts an equality sign between two sides if they both understand that they can die and nobody wants that outcome. \"Peace\" on the other hand effectively does nothing when the other side has a gun. There are **some** exceptions when the vast majority of population supports a given side that much more that guns won't matter (or rather - using them will end up only igniting the situation further) but Afghanistan isn't one of them due to it's very split and tribal nature.",

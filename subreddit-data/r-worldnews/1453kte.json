The reason why countries make their nuclear doctrine public is to avoid misunderstandings or actions that could lead to nuclear war. They are the bright red lines under which countries say this is where we are prepared to risk Armageddon.\n\nIf China had doctrine of permitting the use of nuclear weapons to guarantee the territorial integrity of China (which they interpret to include Taiwan), then any potential armed conflict with the US becomes exponentially more dangerous. Does that mean China would use them if it were in danger of losing? What would happen if the US struck a Chinese airbase with conventional weapons?\n\nChina is basically saying we will deal with any conventional threat with conventional responses. They gain nothing by saying, \"Hah! You sank half our navy and now we unleash Armageddon!\" If anything, they have every incentive to make clear that is where their bright line is to avoid having their navy sunk in the first place.",

By design, it is built to defend against a strike by North Korea. The \u201cnuclear sponge\u201d is much more likely to be a defense against nuclear strikes by Russia, and that is a tactic that both Russia and China employ as well. \n\nSecond, after the US canceled its participation in the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, both the US and Russia agreed to reductions in number of nuclear warheads (SORT).\n\nThird, as for New START, it broke down because Russia suspended its participation just a few months ago.\n\nAs such, a) the US never built any defenses capable of withstanding a nuclear attack by Russia, b) Russia and the USA have agreed to reduce nuclear weapons even after the US canceled ABM, and c) New START was suspended due to an unilateral action by Russia.",

It has a limited capability against ICBMs and also does not have enough numbers to intercept Russia ICBMs. For example, there are 24 missiles. How far do you think 24 missiles in a nuclear strike of many hundreds of missiles would go? Even if these systems would work perfectly (which won\u2019t be the case), that\u2019d be a very, very small amount of Russian weapons intercepted. In other words, Russian nuclear deterrent remains intact. \n\nIt is a system reasonably capable of intercepting IRBMs, but that is not what the bulk of the Russian nuclear arsenal even consists of. \n\nSecond and more important, the USA is quite literally not protected by these bases in Europa. Nothing changes the fact that the USA cannot defend itself against a nuclear launch.\n\nThird, neither it nor the site in Romania are even that relevant to nuclear arms reduction treaties, given that New START was signed and perfectly complied with even when these were built. \n\nOP\u2019s narrative relies on \u201cmissile defenses ruined nuke reduction treaties\u201d completely ignoring that nuclear weapon reduction treaties were both signed and complied with during a slight increase of missile defenses.",

So once they have put all the time and money into building these nuclear weapons, they will be ready to spend even more money to start decommissioning them. Why not save the money that would be spent building all of those weapons and then spending even more to decommission them, while getting the US and Russia to spend their own money on reducing their arsenals and making them less of a threat in the process? That would seem to serve the goal of getting China to nuclear parity with the US and Russia, but cost a whole lot less.\n\nBesides, if China continues building up its nuclear arsenal, how long until the US, Russia, India, and maybe more start producing more weapons as well to prevent China from catching up or getting ahead of them? Do they really believe that everyone else in the world will not see this as an arms race and just sit back while China builds more nuclear weapons and delivery platforms? China isn't usually that unrealistic, so I have to assume they know that their continued nuclear buildup is going to trigger other countries to build up as well. Hopefully it doesn't take a Chinese version of the Cuban missile crisis for China to realize that, if they keep this up, their non-nuclear neighbors who are not on good terms are going to start looking for ways to get weapons on their territory as well. This sort of thing is how nuclear proliferation starts, and no one ends up better off when that happens.",

I imagine that they'd be thrilled for the other two to impose restrictions on themselves, but realistically any arms control treaty China becomes a part of will place restrictions on them as well.\n\nIt's not that they'll want to spend the money to commission them now and more to decommission them later, it's more a relatively diplomatic way to say \"why are you even asking us about this when you have so many more than we do?\"",

Russia would also need to agree to reduce its stockpile. There is political will in the US to work towards further de-nuclearization, but it only works if other countries agree to reduce in lock-step and if they agree to let the other major powers inspect their stockpiles to make sure it is really happening. For a long time, the US and Russia were the only ones that mattered, but as they have reduced their stockpiles it becomes more and more important to start including other nuclear powers in the process. While the US might be willing to make a token reduction to start the process off, real denuclearization is something that all nuclear powers will need to participate in.\n\nChina really only has two options: try to out-build Russia and the US to reach nuclear parity with them, or join with the other minor nuclear powers in the world to pressure Russia and the US into reducing their stockpiles to the level everyone else has, and then proceed from there. China is currently pursuing the former path, which both Russia and the US have already figured out is both unsustainable and difficult to return from. The other path can feel less secure, but ultimately saves a ton of resources and gives China a chance to make allies on the world stage by taking their side against both the US and Russia to end Nuclear proliferation rather than contributing to it. The reality is, the US will never use nuclear weapons against China. Russia is a little more questionable, but even China's current arsenal is enough to deter Russia from a Nuclear attack.\n\nChina already has enough weapons to benefit from the deterrent effects of MAD. Any more is not improving their defensive capability, it's just joining in with the absurd penis-measuring competition that the US and Russia got into to the detriment of every person on the planet. Nuclear weapons are a legitimate threat to all human life on the planet, and it is the duty of every citizen of every country to encourage their government to destroy the weapons they have and not to pursue new ones. As an American, I can tell you that it is our sincere hope that the nuclear weapons we used in anger are the last that are ever used. We never, ever want to see any people subjected to the detonation of a nuclear bomb again. We do not want to be responsible for the end of the world, and neither should any good Chinese citizen. Our governments are wrong on this. We don't need more an better nuclear weapons, we need less. We need to let missile defenses get so good that they can stop all the weapons we have so that Nukes become useless and we can finally let them go. This is not a matter of America versus China, or any nation against any other. This is a matter of humanity against extinction, and it is our duty as human beings who don't want to see our species end to make sure that we push our leaders to stop trying to maintain the ability to end us all, and to build a world where nuclear annihilation is not a threat to anyone.\n\nSorry for the long post, but this is important to me. Not as an American, but as a human being that wants to live, and to see that no nuclear weapons are ever used in anger again.",

During the Cold War height both sides had 30k-40k warheads deployed ready to hair trigger launch. After the cold war Russia and the U.S. came together and together reduced deployed weapons to well under 2k each. And not only that Russia gave all its Soviet vassal states complete independence and even let Germans reunify and fucking returned all of its conventional forces back to its territory. Who does that!?!? \nNATO should have ended right there with a new lasting peace between east and west. But no, NATO just had to expand so the west can achieve hegemony.

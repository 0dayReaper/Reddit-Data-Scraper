There's a whole class of proverbs called Xiehouyu (\u6b47\u5f8c\u8a9e) which are call and response style phrases (the first half a poetic line, the second an explanation). They're given as a complete set but you're only meant to say the first half (and the educated reader will then remember the second and work out what the hell you're saying). It's a bit like in English saying \"an apple a day\", the reader knows to fill in \"keeps the doctor away\" and deduce you're talking about preventative measure.\n\nIt's very possible Xi says things like this because he thinks it makes him sound like a literary genius following this style.",

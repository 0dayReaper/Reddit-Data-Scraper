Heading the private investigation will be David Johnston (who was on the Board of the Trudeau Foundation), whom JT calls a family friend. Johnston asked a former judge to clear him ethically, that being Mr. Iacabucci (also connected with the Trudeau Foundation), whom Johnston calls a lifelong friend. One of the foreign interference issues they're supposed to investigate is that the Trudeau Foundation accepted a $140,000+ donation from alleged CCP agents. They investigated themselves and said there's nothing to see.\n\nEven assuming they're all being honest, the conflict of interest is absolutely insane. It stinks to high heaven. That means this government is either incredibly incompetent on ethics, or they simply don't care about ethics.\n\nHe resigned because everyone (including the left-wing NDP party) kept pointing out how much this \"investigation\" was poisoned from the start.",

It's classified.

Refused to re-new his security clearances that would get him access to NISCOP information and CSIS documents. \n\nAll so he can play politics and claim bullshit without having to actually back it up. it's theatre for him. Not about actually protecting our elections. PP doesn't care either, remember, the ONLY legislation he has ever successfully submitted and passed in 18 years as MP was an attack on elections. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Elections_Act\n\nHe is also involved in his own election interference scandal in which someone actually DID go to jail for: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Canadian_federal_election_voter_suppression_scandal",

In order to encourage truthful and complete disclosure without fear of reprisal or other adverse actions as a result of their testimony, this right is also extended to individuals who appear before the House or its committees. The House of Commons could not work effectively unless its members, and witnesses appearing before House committees, were able to speak and criticize without being held to account by any outside body.\n\nIf PP/Singh, saw the information and truly utterly thought it was needed to be shared, they have the floor to do so in house with impunity.\n\nThey wouldn't be allowed to send documents, soundbites, or actual confidential information to the media. But they absolutely could raise it in the house, and absolutely use it to pass a non-confidence vote should they want.\n\nThe choice to play ignorance and \"wait\" for a hopeful leak to re-enforce their rhetoric is nothing more than pure politics, and willingly spreading misinformation without fact. They want to be able to run to the media with anything that hurts the sitting government regardless if it's based in fact or reality.\n\nIt's gross, unethical behaviour unbefitting of sitting parliamentarians.\n\n&gt; But still not as gross as Trudeau, essentially, investigating himself and finding no wrong doing.\n\nMore absolute bullshit lies:\n\nTrudeau nor the LPC are \"under investigation\". This investigation was not looking into the LPC or investigating Trudeau in any shape or form\n\nIt was to review the CSIS documents to determine the scope of possible political interference from foreign agents. It started because of an unsubstantiated leak by a CSIS employee to Global News that Global ran without vetting. Even National Post and PostMedia organization refused to run the story because it was not provable.\n\nJohnston report claims there was. He never denied foreign interference happened, nor \"cleared\" Trudeau. That is a fabrication made by PP and ignorant people like yourself.\n\nJohnston's report, if you cared to read it instead of playing partisan politics, outlined that numerous attempts of foreign interference did occur, and that he does, and CSIS does not believe it had any material impact on election results. But that further measures should be considered and taken by ALL parliamentarians to protect against foreign interference for all MP's. And that a further inquiry is necessary but a public one is a bad idea due to the sensitive security nature of the intel.\n\nThe Question then. Do you disagree with the findings in that report? Or are you just so hellbent at discrediting anything that doesn't fit into your fake reality.",

They questioned Johnston on it publicly during his senator hearing. It was during that questioning it was revealed that the liberal party didn't reveal critical information to Johnston. That being that the CCP funded adds during the last election against the conservative party. Johnston admitted that this information wasn't provided to him. The conservatives had this information already through sources other then CSIS and they had information that showed JT was aware of it but held it reserve for this specific questioning on Johnston's report. They wanted Johnston to be in position where he was forced to admit he never had this information.\n\nIt was 1-2 days after this questioning that Johnston resigned. In his letter to JT said, and I paraphrase, to JT that he should work with the other parties with getting this investigation completed.\n\nIt was the CSIS report that all the parties refused to go over. As by accepting the CSIS report they would have to be bound to secrecy or sign a NDA. Then they wouldnt be able to talk about it all. That's why they refused the CSIS report.",

Congrats, now someone less qualified and capable will have to step up and make exactly the same decisions as he would have made because there is not going to be a public inquiry. There wouldn\u2019t be a public inquiry no matter which political party was in power and they all know it. There\u2019s nothing that the public would learn in an inquiry because we all know that China and other actors have been trying to interfere in our democracy and others. The question is how much the intelligence agencies know, and what they are doing about it and that\u2019s something that the public CANT know because it would require publicly disclosing sources and methods and may violate our allies secrets as well. The REAL beneficiary of a public inquiry would be the Chinese",

Why won't he reup (or his wifes) and meet with CSIS/Johnston if not to play politics?\n\n&gt; Secondly, membership in NISCOP, the federal security committee you speak of, requires members to not publicly speak about anything they learn or that is discussed.\n\nEven O'Toole has said this is bullshit, and that if Pierre wanted to, he could speak in the house of commons on anything he wanted. There is parliamentary privilege which protects MP's in the house for this very reason. In addition, he can absolutely speak on the truth of the facts, without speaking the facts. \"I have seen the evidence and it corroborates my claims\". The fact he refuses to see the evidence should in itself be proof he doesn't actually care about the truth.\n\n&gt; Hilarious also that you say they wouldn\u2019t speak to Johnston - the same Johnston who cleared alleged Chinese asset Han Dong without speaking to either him or CSIS; who didn\u2019t speak any conservative MP\u2019s targeted by china (including former leader of the opposition Erin O\u2019Toole, Michael Chong, or Kenny Chiu).\n\nThis is a lie: Johnston did meet with O'Toole. O'Toole himself posted an op-ed about it. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-i-met-with-david-johnston-for-his-report-heres-what-happened/. your claim here is straight up lying.\n\n&gt;  - the same Johnston who cleared alleged Chinese asset Han Dong without speaking to either him or CSIS; \n\nanother lie. Johnston has and had access to all the CSIS documents, transcripts and recording of the call involving Dong. It turns out the \"leak\" and the report by Global was actually a full on lie,, to the point that Global  has now parted ways and fired Cooper (the journalist who didn't vet the information). Heck, even PostMedia refused to run the story because they couldn't vet the leak as valid.\n\n&gt; It\u2019s not the CSIS information, it\u2019s the NISCOP committee info, and as I have pointed out, once they are members they cannot publicly talk about anything tangentially related to the information they learn about on the committee.

Or do you openly support your political leaders intentionally lying to create political division for their own gain?\n\nor do you actually want the truth and for our elections to be protected.\n\nsounds like you're just being mindlessly partisan and swallowing PP's load.",

Johnston made it very clear in his report that foreign interference came from numerous places, not just China. Including Russia and the USA and that further measures by all parties should be done to protect our elections.\n\nConservatives continues to scream that Trudeau is guilty and in bed with China, despite that not being what this is about. It also ignores the facts that the CPC itself also was involved as Johnston report outlines 6 LPC and 4 CPC MP's who were targeted for interference by China.\n\nWe need to have further investigation into meddling, and we need fact based measures in place. But it doesn't seem like the CPC cares to fix election meddling and just getting rid of Trudeau is more important. At least Singh has said what's the point in forcing an election while the very trustworthy of an election is at stake?",

Do you think it would have been prudent to get a full testimony from Michael Chong or Han Dong before coming to a conclusion? Do you think that he should be using the same PR firm as Han Dong? What about his friendship with Justin Trudeau and his family? They have previously acknowledged a close friendship after all. \n\nAnd lastly, how do you feel about such an important investigation being led by a single person. If the whole thing is about corruption and external interference, wouldn't you want it being run by multiple people appointed by each party to work in tandem, much harder to influence a team like that.

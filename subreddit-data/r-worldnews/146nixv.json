(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; TAIPEI, June 11 - Taiwan&amp;#039;s air force scrambled into action on Sunday after spotting 10 Chinese warplanes crossing the sensitive median line of the Taiwan Strait, as the island&amp;#039;s defence ministry said four Chinese warships also carried out combat patrols.\n\n&gt; Taiwan sent up its own fighters and deployed ships and land-based missile systems to keep watch, it said, using typical wording for how it responds to such Chinese activities.\n\n&gt; In a Sunday video address to supporters on the Taiwan-controlled Matsu islands close to the Chinese coast, Taiwan&amp;#039;s Vice President William Lai said he would do his best to &amp;quot;Stabilise the peaceful status quo in the Taiwan Strait&amp;quot; if he wins the presidency, his campaign office said.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/146nkr0/taiwan_sends_up_fighters_as_chinese_warplanes/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688497 tl;drs so far.\") | [Service Blackout](https://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/146cacj/joining_the_blackout_a_message_from_uautotldr/ \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Taiwan**^#1 **Chinese**^#2 **China**^#3 **island**^#4 **air**^#5",

They can train and do military exercises anywhere in China or along their coasts, but they choose to skirt along the lines of Taiwan\u2019s ADIZ &amp; FIR \u2014which is extremely provocative. \u00a0\n\nChina does this as an obvious show of force. They simply want to intimidate Taiwan. \u00a0\n\n**In return, Taiwan reports these incursions so that this aggression and belligerence is not \"normalized\" and does not escalate.**",

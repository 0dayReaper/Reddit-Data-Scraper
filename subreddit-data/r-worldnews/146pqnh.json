In an apronym, the letters in the abbreviation itself spells out something meaningful ie. MADD has \"mad\" in it. It doesn't mean an abbreviation that just happens to be used as if it were a word.",

The bald eagle is actively and positively associate with the USA, monkeys are not actively and positively associated with \"Africans\". So yeah it's a racist comment. Continuing the biology of it, bald eagles are limited to the Northern American region, whilst monkeys exist in more regions than Africa.

We _want_ to paint our fellows in the best possible light. Dislike or anger are uncomfortable, confrontational emotions to experience, and we try to find reasons to not experience them, no matter how much we have to stretch the presented facts to accomplish this.\n\nBut people become awful when they find power, or perhaps it's that awful people seek out power. I spent the first part of my life coming up with excuses for this kind of person as a default, knee-jerk reaction. I wanted to preserve an 'innocent until proven guilty' mindset, but I got tired of being proven wrong time and time again. Jumping in to their defense causes harm. You don't need to leap in and accuse people, if that makes you uncomfortable - they'll reveal their own guilt every time.",

And to be fair japanese gyoza do have differences With jiaozi, and japanese Zen is also diff\u00e9rent chinese Chan Buddhism Even if it comes from it, and many people do the proper usage when they do refer to the japanese variant of things, if they say shoalin monks are \"zen Buddhist\" , then yeah, that's not quite accurate. \n\nOne final detail though, Cang jie is a computer input method for chinese characters not the name of them, the name is Hanzi \uff08\u6f22\u5b57=\"Han characters\" ), in Japanese they call it the same but pronounce it Kanji, which is an evolution of an earlier chinese pronunciation, you have minnan for example where it's pronounced \"Han ji\", mandarin in general differs a lot from older chinese where cantonese, minnan, and some other dialects tend to keep sounds closer to middle chinese, and you notice usually japanese pronunciation of chinese words sound very similar to those dialects, like \u4e16\u754c\uff08mandar\u00edn: shijie, Japanese: Sekai, cantonese: saigai, minnan Sekai/Sigai).",

Neanderthals were in groups of 25, and hunting by separating from herd was a sustainable way to get meat on the table. That meant that the Neanderthals usually followed and preyed on the herd. 80k years ago, due to language, we were organizing in multiple groups of up to 50 that coordinated so we just made a big human chain and pushed the entire herd in a killing zone - off a cliff or something. Then we took all the bones and pelts, had a big fire, yeah sure Neanderthal could come and share the meat (it's so much, it's gonna spoil anyway) even though we definitely couldn't understand each other more than at a basic level; Much friendship, trinkets are exchanged, and if there are disagreements, we eventually win because we call all our buddies and their own tribes, can talk to each other during fights and pass on grudges. We move on to our next mass killing, and they are left herdless. Perhaps a few of them figure that, like dogs, maybe if they follow us, more meat is to be found - and those few that abandon their tribes to follow the sapiens mate with them, and produce some offspring that can also mate with sapiens, thus their faint current genetic imprint.",

We (non-pure Africans) are hybrids. Which meant we interbred with them. After sapiens entered their territories and interbred with them, they went extinct. We don't know the circumstances of this interbreeding - it may not have been a consensual thing. I think we likely had a hand in exterminating them.\n\nSapiens in history have exterminated other populations of sapiens with relatively minor cultural or biological differences. Why would they not exterminate another species? I'm sure there were adaptation advantages post Ice Age for modern humans, but some of those advantages for (example) Europeans came from Neanderthal DNA (e.g. skin colour). The first modern humans to enter Europe were not more adapted than the Neanderthals - they had to adapt genetically - with an obvious change being skin colour - the original Europeans had a skin tone similar to sub saharan Africans. Why would Neanderthal DNA not adapt to changing conditions at the same time?",

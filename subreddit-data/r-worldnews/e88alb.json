            "comment": "&gt; **The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has imposed a four-year ban on Russia from all global sport, including the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Individual Russian athletes untainted by the scandal will still be able to compete in competitions independently under a neutral flag.**\n\n&gt; **WADA's executive committee took the decision after concluding Moscow had tampered with laboratory data. The agency found Russia planted fake evidence and deleted files linked to positive doping tests that could have helped identify drug cheats. Russia has 21 days to appeal the decision through the Court of Arbitration for Sport.**\n\n&gt; Sky's sports correspondent Martha Kelner has said the country is expected to appeal. She continued: \"(WADA's) decision in many ways is not a surprise because it comes after the recommendation of WADA's compliance review committee. It all relates to this doping scandal which has engulfed international sport for the last few years.\u201d\n\n&gt; \"Russia, at the height of that systematic doping programme, were hoodwinking the world. We heard how they passed dirty urine samples through the wall of a toilet at the Sochi Olympics in 2014 and switched them with clean samples. That was how cynical this doping programme was.\"\n\n[More from BBC:](https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/50710598)\n\n&gt; **Wada's executive committee made the unanimous decision in a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland. Wada president Sir Craig Reedie said the decision showed its \"determination to act resolutely in the face of the Russian doping crisis\". He added: \"For too long, Russian doping has detracted from clean sport. The blatant breach by the Russian authorities of Rusada's reinstatement conditions demanded a robust response. That is exactly what has been delivered. Russia was afforded every opportunity to get its house in order and re-join the global anti-doping community for the good of its athletes and of the integrity of sport, but it chose instead to continue in its stance of deception and denial.\"**\n\n&gt; **But Wada vice-president Linda Helleland said the ban was \"not enough\". \"I wanted sanctions that can not be watered down,\" she said. \"We owe it to the clean athletes to implement the sanctions as strongly as possible.\"**\n\n&gt; **It comes after Russia's Anti Doping Agency (Rusada) was declared non-compliant for manipulating laboratory data handed over to investigators in January 2019. It had to hand over data to Wada as a condition of [its controversial reinstatement in 2018](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/45565273) after a three-year suspension for its vast state-sponsored doping scandal.**\n\n&gt; A total of 168 Russian athletes competed under a neutral flag at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang after the country was banned following the 2014 Games, which it hosted in Sochi. Russian athletes won 33 medals in Sochi, 13 of which were gold. Russia has been banned from competing as a nation in athletics since 2015.\n\n&gt; **Russia has been banned from competing as a nation in athletics since 2015. Despite the ban, Russia will be able to compete at Euro 2020 - in which St Petersburg will be a host city - as European football's governing body Uefa is not defined as a 'major event organisation' with regards to rulings on anti-doping breaches.**\n\n&gt; Rusada was initially declared [non-compliant in November 2015](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/34765444) after a Wada-commissioned report by sports lawyer Professor Richard McLaren alleged widespread corruption that amounted to state-sponsored doping in Russian track and field athletics. [A further report, published in July 2016, declared Russia operated a state-sponsored doping programme for four years across the \"vast majority\" of summer and winter Olympic sports.](https://www.bbc.com/sport/36823453)\n\n&gt; In 2018, Wada reinstated Rusada as compliant after the national agency agreed to release data from its Moscow laboratory from the period between January 2012 and August 2015. However, positive findings contained in a version courtesy of a whistleblower in 2017 were missing from the January 2019 data, which prompted a new inquiry.\n\n&gt; Wada's compliance review committee (CRC) recommended a raft of measures based \"in particular\" on a forensic review of inconsistencies found in some of that data. **As part of the ban, Russia may not host, or bid for or be granted the right to host any major events for four years, including the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games.**\n\nHere\u2019s WADA\u2019s proc\u00e9dure should Russia accept or (definitely) reject this decision: https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2019-12/wada-clarifies-next-steps-of-the-rusada-compliance-process",

Or everyone interested in this, at least. I feel like that documentary was the catalyst for all of this shit against Russia.\n\nEdit: I should expound on what I meant by thinking it was the catalyst: obviously it's not technically or literally the catalyst for these sanctions and bans, but I feel it has what gave light and notoriety to Russia being dopers, as well as credibility to the whistleblowers.\n\nBefore the filmmaker was on JRE I had never heard of this documentary or anything about Russia being dopers. Then I watched the documentary and since that day I've seen more and more headlines about Russia getting banned.\nMaybe JRE was the main catalyst that got people to watch the documentary and pay attention to this stuff, but I realize calling it the catalyst was a poor choice of words since I simply meant that it gave light and creedance to the doping scandal and claims of the whistleblowers.",

They had both the infrastructure and fan culture to create a pretty decent world cup.\n\nOn the other hand there is not a single redeeming factor about choosing Qatar as a host. They have no football history, no fan culture, no infrastructure and to top it of, such horrible climate that they have to trash the entire football season around the world in order to accommodate for a winter schedule. And THEN there's the politics on top of that.\n\nEveryone always knew that FIFA was corrupt through and through, but we were naive enough to believe that they would at least make marginally sensible decisions to benefit the sport at least a little, not just their bank accounts.",

As in, they're always purely set on the results and very little on the process, while we in the west can be much more focused on the process, and the idea that from good process comes good results.\n\nThis means that cheating is seen just as a tool, morality does not enter into it. If you're supposed to win, then you use all and any tools at your disposal. If you elect to disregard certain tools that could make you win, as in, you chose not to cheat, then you'd be an idiot and you're failing your objective. The objective is after all to win, it's not \"don't cheat\".\n\nDo I agree with it? Of course not. But I can understand the rationale.",

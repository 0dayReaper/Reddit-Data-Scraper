[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2.

For a different comparison - east Germany knew that semiconductors were important and invested heavily in the 60s to 80s to try to get ahead of the entirety of the west. Of course they failed, but in doing so they spent as much as 10% of their GDP building infrastructure and training engineers. Dresden is now one of the largest sites for semiconductor manufacturing in the west, because the infrastructure and people are all there.\n\nImagine how hard it is to build a leading Semiconductor fab. Just the machines alone cost hundreds of millions. Tsmc are planning to spend 33b usd on their new 2nm fab, and that is over at least a decade. Training engineers takes even longer - consider that a senior engineer basically needs 30 years of training on high end equipment, which you don't have yet unless you started a long time ago.\n\nEssentially, no matter how much anyone invests it will take decades to catch up with Taiwan. Unless china invades I guess.",

If Russia wins, they will absorb Belarus, invade Moldova, possibly Georgia, possibly other states as well, and will pose a greater threat to the EU and Nato. If they lose, Russia's ability to threaten their neighbours will be largely neutralized for decades, and there's a chance that the country - if the federation stays together - will emerge from the collapse as a functioning democracy with something to offer the world besides threats. The first scenario is more expensive to everyone in the long run.\n\nThere's also an issue of rising fascism to counter, as well as attacks on democracy that would be bad for all of us.\n\nPlus, it's the right thing to do. Ukraine gave up its nukes to secure its borders back in 1994, Russia spent 20 years interfering and corrupting everything, and Russia's invasion in 2014 - precipitated by a political move to the west, the EU and maybe Nato - was a direct result. If the people of Ukraine didn't repel their attempt to take Kyiev last year, that country would be another corrupt Russian state right now with people disappearing left and right.",

Russia turning to democracy is seemingly impossible, as corruption and bribery run so deep, it's impossible to tell how far it goes. When Putin dies, whether it's cancer or a bullet, another one just like him will come on in and fill his shoes. If Russia loses, they will still be a threat, as their nuclear umbrella is still potent. \n\n  I hope and pray for a Ukrainian victory, but let's not delude ourselves into thinking Russia could become an actual functional democracy. It would take a massive civilian uprising, which clearly isn't going to happen. Through endless and constant propaganda, the Russian peoples overwhelming support Putin and his war, with only a fraction of the population being against it.",

Keep the pay low (relatively), don't put sufficient flow of healthcare professionals through the education system and have premiers that really want a private healthcare sector as well.  Throw in a pandemic and stir.  And here we are.\n\nBesides, this logic is always a complete strawman.  Another country is getting attacked?  Can't help, our healthcare system is having issues.  Flooding or fires?  No money, the healthcare system is in trouble.  Education system failing people?  Healthcare.\n\nWhile money solves a lot of issues, it can be used in a lot more than one direction at once.  And just because something is having problems doesn't mean we can't fix something else.",

There is quite literally a deficit of competent staff within our medical system and high rates of burnout without new replacement staff due to an unprecedented 100-year pandemic that we are just coming out of. To argue that we should falter in maintaining democracy and human rights worldwide because we have our own \"domestic issues\" to deal with is a Russian propaganda talking point, and the damage Ukraine's loss would do to the free world will, in the long term, do far more damage to our country and its people's well-being than a pandemic-induced medical staffing imbalance. Not discounting that either though, people need to be properly incentivized to pursue a career in the medical field and all the conspiracy theorists that spat in their faces for the last 3 years as nurses and doctors continue to pull 16 hour shifts on a daily basis has by no means been helping the situation. Nobody wants to be a doctor or nurse anymore.",

Yeah I\u2019ve got to wait 5-6 hours at the ER to get stitched up but i also walk out without paying a dime.. i also had surgery two years ago and from referral to operation was near or around 6-8 months? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s terrible. Not when it is free, nationwide. \n\nAnd the homelessness epidemic is obfuscated by the opioid epidemic. There\u2019s a shitload of homeless because there\u2019s a shitload of crackheads. These issues fall under provincial governments, not federal. Provinces are dropping the ball with the housing crisis. The cost of living + housing crisis here in BC for example is the BC government\u2019s issue, the federal government has no part in it, and there is really nothing they could do if they wanted to. You could argue they are responsible for say, our astronomical gas prices, currently 2.05/L today, but the BC government is responsible for all of the taxes and shit on it. Of which there is something like 60-80 cents per liter going straight to translink, ICBC, road tax, provincial tax.\n\nRegardless, all of these things come from different areas of the budget. It\u2019s not like we are just losing that money. There is always a huge portion earmarked for international aid.",

The various levels of governance use our money to build affordable housing.  We have to stop pandering to big business that keep profits for themselves while average citizens have to choose between eating or paying high rent.  My point is that a half billion will have a positive impact that you'll see right here.  This half billion will make those who are doing okay feel better about themselves. It's like giving a dollar to someone who is forced to beg.  That dollar makes you feel good, but it doesn't really help the person you gave it to.  This is a tough nut.

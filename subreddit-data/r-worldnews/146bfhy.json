(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; The Left - the most left-wing party in the German Bundestag - called on its former leader Sahra Wagenknecht to give up her parliamentary seat on Saturday following speculations about her plan to start a new political party.\n\n&gt; The party expressed concerns that Wagenknecht is using resources from her role as a member of the Bundestag for The Left to get a new party going.\n\n&gt; The 53-year-old was born in East Germany and was a member of the Soviet successor party - the Party of Democratic Socialism - which merged to form The Left in 2007.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/146bi3p/germanys_left_calls_on_controversial_lawmaker_to/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688477 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **party**^#1 **Left**^#2 **Wagenknecht**^#3 **seat**^#4 **member**^#5",

In light of controversies surrounding one of their lawmakers, they're calling for them to step down from the party. Will they do it? Who knows. But it sounds like there's some drama brewing over in German politics.",

Russia could be considered communist (they're not, it's a dictatorship) and the \"far left\" will say that since the government owns/has control of the majority of major industries it's leftist. \n\nSince they're a dictatorship though, the far left sees the fascism in it and supports a \"grand ruler\" with their same values. \n\nIn the end though, most people aren't far one way or another. The extremists (left and right) are more likely to vote. The ones in the middle are less likely. For example, in the USA republicans are quite outnumbered and keep winning. Gerrymandering is part of it, especially at the state level, but it's not the entire picture. \n\nIt just polarizes candidates to go hard in one way or the other to capture the \"for sure gonna vote\" extemists. Rather than someone like Bernie Sanders who wants Capitalism with social aspects. He's *far* left in the USA but not elsewhere. \n\nTo reinforce my point about Russia.... They're far right. It's a dictator. But some will claim it's far left because communism is far left. But they're not communist. The people on top keep it all, not the population. They don't own the means of production and they don't benefit from it directly. They *pretend* to be communists.",

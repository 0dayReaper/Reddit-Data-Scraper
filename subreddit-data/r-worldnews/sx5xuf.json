But, in November 2002, it was Johnson who found himself the subject of an investigation in a storyline that resembled one of the narratives he would routinely partake in during his run on the Golden Globe-winning TV series.\n\nJohnson, along with two other men \u2014 his personal assistant and an \u201cunnamed Swiss financial advisor\u201d \u2014 were stopped by German customs officials as they made their way into the country by way of Switzerland. Everything seemed legit; the customs agents were even fans of Johnson. \u201cI signed some autographs, we joked around,\u201d he told Larry King in 2003.\n\n**The seeds of trouble for Johnson were sitting in the trunk of the car. When officials searched it, they discovered a briefcase with over $8 billion in receipts, certificates, and credit notes. It seemed a bit odd. Johnson explained that the paperwork was from investors he was in the process of collaborating with for his film production company. The customs agents made copies of everything in the briefcase, and sent Johnson on his way, presumably to the Daimler-Chrysler plant in Germany to see the new Maybach.**\n\n\u201cAt this stage, we\u2019re only assessing the documents,\u201d said Wolfgang Schmitz, a spokesman for customs. \u201cAfter that, we\u2019ll decide whether we\u2019ll start with investigations.\u201d\n\nJohnson believed that everything had been cleared. He heard nothing from German authorities, and nothing from the U.S. Tax department for several months. It was quiet. And then, suddenly the whispers of a money-laundering racket became very loud.\n\nMarch 2003\n\n**\u201cThere\u2019s a reasonable suspicion that Mr. Johnson was working for others. If everything is legal, you don\u2019t have to transport documents worth this amount in a car,\u201d**said Joerg Groener, a spokesman for the local Customs Investigation Department in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.",

These selfish fools disregard the fact that where ever you end up in life is a result of some people's support, may it be parents, teachers, coworkers, and even customers. \n\nThose that hoard wealth are people with huge insecurities and egos.

Such a huge group of people see people with opposing views as so out of their minds that they're not even worth entertaining as serious people/are horrible and refuse to associate with or work with that I have no idea how to get people willing to compromise.  People are willingly letting themselves be further and further shoved into different realities because it's more comfortable being surrounded by people and shown news that support your worldview.  The different factions are essentially living in two different worlds by being shown and choosing to continue to exist in completely different interpretations of what's going on.  And I just don't know how you get people who aren't even seeing the same world on the same page.",

But one thing I truly believe is : Focus on what we have in common. \nNo matter your race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, etc. Every human have the same basic needs. We all want a roof on our head, food on the table, knowing our loved ones are safe and healthy, spending time with those loved ones, cleaner air, cleaner water. If we focus on those things, then our differences become meaningless in the big scheme. Our differences should be valued to make the most out of it. They should NEVER be used as a weapon to hate each other. \n\nDiversity makes everything better. We should try to learn from others (we don\u2019t learn from people who always agree with us). \n\nThe rich has us fighting over breadcrumbs and that make us lose perspective that teaming up would be the solution.",

The rest... well, it\u2019s not that we\u2019re turned against eachother, I can assure you.\n\nIt\u2019s that we\u2019re tired.  MOST people live paycheck to paycheck. Too occupied to even comprehend change let alone talk about it let alone advocate for it let alone facilitate it.  The ones who aren\u2019t living paycheck to paycheck are also busy, less so, but advocating for or facilitating change is a virtual guarantee of losing your small place you have in society, either through your superiors casting you down or through the roughly 5% of people forcing you to shut up and maybe move if you get unlucky.  \n\nAnyone above that is going to work to keep their position but like... 80% of America sits in those two places.  Tired and scared and they just want to secure their and their families happiness.  We need something to actively disrupt society before we can really make change, and it can\u2019t be caused by any one person.  It needs to be a true social reckoning out of our control.  \n\nLike climate change lol.",

It was the greatest cross-border joint-investigative consolidation of journalism in human history.  It returned *billions* of dollars, unseated two prime ministers, sent a ton of people (and politicians) to jail, changed a lot of finance laws/regulations, closed the loopholes being exploited, and introduced new regulatory measures that bring more accountability into moving finances across countries.\n\nIt accomplished everything it set out to do, and so much more.\n\nBut because it didn't solve all the world's problems, or turn class hierarchy on its head, or absolved the world of all rich corruption, everyone calls it a failure, or uses it as an example of how \"the world will never change\" (despite it being a shining example of the opposite).\n\nIt's so fucking depressing when ignorant cynics take the hard work and sacrifice of so many and dismiss it because they think their ignorance and cynicism is wisdom.\n\n___\n\nEdit: I responded in more detail below, but [here's a link for a quick, concise summary for anyone interested.](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/what-happened-after-the-panama-papers/)\n\nThat said, it doesn't *really* do justice to how much work went into the investigation, and the nuances of the impact that are still spreading today.  But it's worth a quick read.",

My friend worked at a \"local\" bank and they were advised to show wealthy clients ways to circumvent taxes for their holiday homes. Many of our local people cant afford living in towns, wich became famous ski resorts, because rent exploded and rich investors bought all the property, using them 2 weeks a year. We had to make a legislation against it. We payed the UBS 70 billion to save them from bankruptcy after 2008. a private bank. Wealthy people can evade communal tax by giving them a set amount, to pay less than they should (eg. Tina Turner, Elton John, Petula Clark). Something about us is so greasy, conniving and insular, which is reflected in our society and culture. im sad",

Lobbying is standard practice in politics. Imagine the amount of money flooding in. Infrastructure, education, science, military, health care, employment everything \"benefits\" from business tax. You have to get a 100K signatures to get an initiative going in our direct democracy than the Bundesrat (7 presidents basically) puts it up for vote with a counterproposal. The left tried to limit the earnings of Ceo's thru an initiative it got rejected. political parties are doing it the most, cuz they can fund it. but sadly this system gets abused with stupid initiatives. (burka banning etc.) A single individual (elton john) can finance a whole town with tax and it will gladly except less than the billionaire should pay! companies like black rock, Cs, Ubs, hsbc dictate politics.

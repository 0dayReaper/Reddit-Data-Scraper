Optimistically for Russia they still need to last about 600 days and so far we haven\u2019t even reached 500 days from the start of the full invasion to now. In the next few months Ukraine will have Abrams and F-16s not to mention US manufacturing pumping out artillery shells and rockets left and right. Combine that with the other NATO aid and the next 600 days could look very rough for Russia. There\u2019s also the chance that Biden wins again in 2024 and even if the GOP takes the Senate McConnel is not a friend of Putin\u2019s.\n\nIf we expand the view beyond the US the Kremlin seems to have a belief that western democracy is in an inevitable decline and that we will see more people like Trump, Erdogan and Orban elected. Because of this the Kremlin thinks time is on their side. \u201cWait for the west to get tired\u201d may be Russia\u2019s strategy but I think it\u2019s a very flawed strategy that reeks of desperation and trying to rationalize a fantasy into reality.",

Now it\u2019s China building apartments, roads, stadiums, hospitals and bridges. Rest assured they expect fealty in exchange\u2014from supporting China\u2019s ambitions to take over Taiwan, to changing the reserve currency, or whatever they want, of course.\n\nCompare this to 1983 when President Reagan invaded Grenada to free it from a communist coup. The phrase \u201cgreeted as liberators\u201d that you heard from Dick Cheney concerning invading Iraq actually came from the *Grenada* invasion where, in fact, we were greeted as liberators despite worldwide condemnation for interfering with a sovereign nation. The people, indeed, welcomed our invasion and it was the last truly \u201cgreat thing\u201d the US had done since to build connections with foreign lands.\n\nSince then, however, we\u2019ve abandoned these people and others throughout the Caribbean while China has stepped up. Whenever there\u2019s a need for infrastructure\u2014due to finances or hurricanes\u2014China has literally come in with bulldozers, crew, and money.\n\nThe US invaded Grenada because of an abrupt and violent change in political power that ostensibly was designed to prevent the spread of Communism but also to prevent the establishment of tactical bases that could be used to attack the US.\n\nInasmuch as the Caribbean is part of North America, we\u2019ve ignored what\u2019s going on in our own backyard as China creeps in \u2026 for better or for worse.",

From the article:\n\n&gt;The U.S. and Israel stopped financing UNESCO after it voted to include Palestine as a member state in 2011. The Trump administration decided in 2017 to withdraw from the agency altogether the following year, citing long-running anti-Israel bias and management problems.\n\nTrump did withdraw the US from UNESCO, but it looks like the Obama administration blocked funding first. I'm kinda shocked by that.\n\nI'm relatively neutral on the Israel-Palestinian issue, admittedly because I know very little about it, but I really don't think the USA should be setting its foreign policy based on what Israel wants.\n\nedit:\n\nInteresting thing I dug up:\n\n&gt;U.S. legislation prohibits funding to any UN agency that grants full membership to any group that does not have \u201cinternationally recognized attributes\u201d of statehood.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-unesco-funding-idUSBRE89A0Q620121011\n\nThe Obama administration's hand might have been forced (I can't say that conclusively, it depends who signed the legislation into law).\n\nedit 2: The law was passed in the 90s. Seems like the Obama administration had its hand forced. \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-unesco-usa-funding-idUSTRE79U5ED20111031",

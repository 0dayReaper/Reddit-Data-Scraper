Most important being Indo-USSR pact in 1971 which while loose on terms in it,  gave assurance that in case of invasion of india, USSR will come to the aid of  India.( It was mostly to deter USA and china who threatened invasion if India tried to stop Bengali genocide). Similar pact was also signed with Russia but only with material help. Other friendship pacts were signed with nepal and Bhutan\n\nWhile NAM started with high hopes by late 1960's it was losing heat as most small countries aligned themselves with either of superpowers",

The point is the thais largely made it out by sheer luck and their nation was hanging by the knives edge every day while the swiss had a solid position.\n\nFor larger more significant nations to pull of such feats is far more impressive so the comparison makes no sense.\n\nIm also not a fan of exceptionalism practiced by China and the usa but you cant put forth an argument by comparing them to what amounts to micronations.",

Brics can be a useful tool to take this forward.\n\n\nYes, India and China have been in defacto cold war for years now. And yet, China is one of India's largest trading partners. India is trying to slowly reduce its dependence on China. While working diplomatically and other wise to counter China's belligerence. The world need not be black and white.",

The only conflict in the region most likely to happen is a China Taiwan war. Strictly speaking the geographic scope is rather limited so it is not truly considered a world war. Once that happens, it is highly unlikely China will just leave access routes to within the First Island Chain open to US and allies. They need to maximise their chances so they will attempt to seize control of the First Island Chain or seal it off such that it becomes a non-factor. When a China Taiwan war starts, China has to go all in, otherwise it is difficult to succeed. SEA countries will effectively not have a say in this, China will strike first. That is what the large military China has is for. There is a reason why Singapore is looking at defending against hypersonic missiles when only China feasibly fields that capability in the region, not to mention that Singapore is co-developing a new missile with the Israelis with 300km range.",

Sending out a new carrier group and making a new carrier group don't take the same amount of time. \n\nAlso, assuming it's not in a location where India would be able to tap ground based air reinforcements, the power of China and India's navies are wildly lopsided in favor of China. Their aircraft carriers are not equivalents. India's are far worse\n\nAnd its also not about manufacturing capabilities to rebuilt naval forces. It's about manufacturing ability to build them up. China's procurement is at a far more effecient rate. They take less time per ship and can make multiple ships at the same time across 2-3 different shipyards. While India only has 1 shipyard capable of building ships of these size and has historically taken much longer to produce something much smaller/worse. In a couple more years, the gap would only grow, since China are making multiple ships simultaneously, at faster rates per ship, which each ship being more advanced and bigger than their planned Indian counterparts",

India has an insane amount of experience in mountain warfare, due to the previous wars - China, as well as ongoing clashes with Pakistan, and terrorists.\n\nTill perhaps two years ago, China couldn\u2019t feasibly have won a mountain war, because they did not have air support infrastructure to cater to the region - which they have since rectified, of course. And india has built their own set of infrastructure as well.\n\nChina does not have the level of war experience that the current Indian military establishment does, which should *sort of* reduce the severe advantage they have in sheer strength. \n\nThe one area of warfare that india cannot feasibly catch up on, is cyber warfare.",

Xi Jinping has exhorted PLA more than once to be prepared to wage a war in the information era. Combined with the penetration of Chinese IT and communications infrastructure in India, India's testy domestic security situation, and China's infamous cyberwarfare capabilities, things don't look terribly good for India at all. This is even without counting  the massive and opaque investment China is making in its conventional and nuclear arsenals. I'd bet that the Chinese are incessantly building the capability to cripple India without firing a single bullet. They'd be fools not to take this low hanging fruit.\n\nI just don't think that the Indian leaders are technically up to the task - they possibly don't even understand the risks; they seem to be more intent on winning useless religious battles at home involving cartoon deities and settling political scores with domestic rivals via persecution. There was an incident where a foreign private agency detected China test-running disrupting the power network in Mumbai, and informed India. Indian agencies were not even aware of this possibility until someone outside told them. Braggadocio doesn't really cut it when it comes to a technologically sophisticated adversary; at some point, you have to have core, hard capabilities to defend and attack.\n\nIndia is arguably more militarily powerful than it was in 1962. But unfortunately, it is also vastly more vulnerable to heretofore unseen attacks by China.",

Many african women could not afford to keep buying the formula but since they stopped breastfeeding they stopped producing milk.\n\nTLDR: Nestle so eager to create another 'market' for their stupid shit disguised salespeople as nurses and held a big misinformation campaign to create a demand where there wasn't one, for a need that didn't exist, and in the process a shitload of infants died after their mothers stopped producing milk because they couldn't afford to keep buying formula.\n\nNestle is the one company on the planet that really is worth the effort to boycot.\n\nIt takes a little bit of effort to find out what brands are owned by nestle (more than you think, and every few years I discover another one is owned or was acquired ) but once you do please stop buying their products.\n\nhttps://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nestle-subsidiaries.jpg\n\nThey are cartoon villain evil.\n\n\n\n",

These men have no idea about the complex mechanics behind why its not true that they don't own society (they are ignorant to things like social-contract theory, the fundamental principles that private property possible and viable). Most of these men do not contribute to this highest echelon of thought processes, despite having the abundant resources to provide that knowledge to themselves and disperse it to others. In fact the number of those that do , are the .001% of that .001% of our society. It's precisely why Elon Musk is becoming famous, for being a good guy Musk. He's the odd man out in America. Its strange to see a billionaire doing the right thing so massively.  \n\nNo what we are witnessing is the meteoric rise of a parasitic forms of capalists.

Its a difficult thing to do for long, because its tiring after a while and eventually you just say \"fuck-it\" Im tired and I dont care anymore.      \n   But its reality. These men are exactly why America is *most likely* no longer a democracy.      \n  \nI say that statement, not to rile anyone, but for informational and decision making purposes only.    If you call yourself a cat, but you're really a human, you may end up going to a veterinarian when you should be going to a doctor, you may buy cat food when you should buy a pizza. What we have instead is an oligarchy not a democracy. And if/when this repeal goes through we will have another nail in the coffin.                      \nI believe we might have stumbled upon the the mother of all corrupt industries(aside from the banking &amp; government of course). Its an important lesson to learn because we already know why finance and government are corrupt, because they both deal **directly** with power. Telecomms seems to be corrupt in a much more malicious and severe fashion. Its more like a computer virus than the other two. This has been bubbling under the surface for a while now, but Trump is exacerbating it. This america sure is an interesting one. ",

                    "comment": "It does seem a little counter-intuitive though that our clearly corrupt US FCC gets any control at all over the internet that \"no one owns\". You do know that as the 2015 decision stands the FCC (effectively the federal US government) controls the fate of Net Neutrality, right? Before 2015 it was not \"owned\" by anyone and people and existing orgs (like the FTC in the case of throttling bit-torrent) regulated it case-by-case. There was just not any clear big picture plan forward which was the big problem. There wasn't a real framework set up to protect Net Neutrality.\n\nI like what India is proposing a lot more that the title II standoff we are in, in that their version of the FCC oversees our Net Neutrality, but wants to use a committee of varied backgrounds for support on a case-by-case (if I understand it correctly). Putting anything that is supposed to be un-owned and free and open in the control of one organization is pretty stupid if you ask me. \n\nI don't want to support anything Pai (or others in cahoots with Comcast) suggests, but at the same time I don't want an organization like the FCC which has been sleeping with major telecom companies for years in charge of my Net Neutrality. This would mean changing the 2015 decision... but we need a plan for HOW. Some kind of replacement like what India has suggested, or even better, some new organization that cuts the existing FCC out completely. \n\nEDIT better described the FCC power over the internet. I originally over-exaggerated :/ sorry. ",

We\u2019re protesting NATIONWIDE on Dec 7th to stop them. \n\nTLDR LINKS\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Marchfornetneutrality\n\nhttp://www.verizonprotests.com\n\nWHAT'S GOING ON? \nComcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon and the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association (NCTA) have\u00a0spent $572 million on attempts to influence the FCC and other government agencies since 2008\n\nImagine if you couldn't view comments critical of Comcast on Reddit, Facebook, or YouTube while using Comcast internet. Want to use Netflix and not Hulu, you're on Comcast so it will be half as fast as it is now.\n\nNet Neutrality is the basic idea that all Internet traffic should be treated equally. That means ISPs shouldn\u2019t be allowed to block content or charge extra for faster speeds. Current rules implemented in 2015 prohibit this behavior and subject ISPs to utility-style regulations under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just announced its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see &amp; do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO! #1\nIf you live nearby or can make it to DC, GO TO THE MARCH FOR NET NEUTRALITY December 7th. More info at https://www.reddit.com/r/marchfornetneutrality\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO! #2\nProtest in front of your local Verizon store. Go to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info on the December 7th protests near you! Feet on the ground, show your support for net neutrality. \n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO! #3\nIf you're using Comcast, AT&amp;T, or Verizon SWITCH YOUR CARRIER (if you can). Comment on their Twitter feeds, tell them why you're leaving, blow up social media. These companies have spent millions lobbying to influence the government and gain more control of what and how you use the internet. \n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO! #4\nPlaytime is over. Spread this message, talk with a friend, call your representative, do SOMETHING. If net neutrality is changed any actions now can help the appeal lawyers of the future. Don't sit on the sidelines, this is America, let your voice and opinion be expressed. Let others know how important this issue is. \n\nMORE INFORMATION \n\nWHAT\u2019S HAPPENING? The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just announced its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see &amp; do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NET NEUTRALITY? Net neutrality is the basic principle that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\nWHY VERIZON STORES? The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we\u2019re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\nWHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS? Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we\u2019re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\nHOW CAN I JOIN? Click here http://www.verizonprotests.com/ and you\u2019ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can sign up to host one, and we\u2019ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can\u2019t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by calling your lawmakers and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.\n\n",

TRAI did nothing when the old players led by Airtel were squatting on all the bandwidth and overcharging people for 3G data. Until Jio came along and disrupted the market 1 GB of 3G data was Rs250 which is pretty expensive in case of a country like India. Now for twice that amount airtel provides 2.5 GB everyday for a month along with free unlimited calling, texting and roaming. TRAI often takes sensible decisions but they are far from proactive and this time let us give credit where it is due and that is the richest man(of course as corrupt as the next businessman or even more) in India. He was also the one who was instrumental in bringing down the per minute call rate with Rcom when Dhirubhai Ambani was alive and all reliance businesses were run under same umbrella.",

I was trying to compare how hulu has this priced tiring system for movies, live tv, etc. and how, if you were not a comcast customer, you would then need to pay the hulu subscription fee, the additional price for the content you want to see, and then pay a premium to be able to access the hulu service on non-comcast networks, and then pay for premium internet access to be able to stream. \n\nThis plan would be insane, simply because of all the additional fees that you would need to pay if net neutrality is removed. That was the point I was attempting to make. Apologies. \n\nNow, the original post:\n\nIt\u2019s laughable, because The \u201cfast lane\u201d is current speed; and also, if you haven\u2019t seen Hulu\u2019s new offers, like access to live tv, tv channels, etc. with or without ads, it\u2019s making it apparent they are ramping up for the change now...\n\nComcast is a shareholder in Hulu, so there\u2019s also that.\n\nEdit: shareholder; not stakeholder; thank you kind redditor!",

It\u2019s not a story the Astronomers would tell you. It\u2019s a Dwarf planet legend. Darth Pluto was a Dark Lord of the Planets, so powerful and so wise he could influence the astronomers to keep him as a real planet\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of astronomy is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice mike brown everything he knew, then his apprentice turned him into a dwarf planet. Ironic. He could save others from becoming dwarf planets, but not himself.",

                    "comment": "tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We\u2019re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them. Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.\n\nAlso there is a March on DC at https://www.reddit.com/r/marchfornetneutrality\n\nWHAT\u2019S HAPPENING? The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just announced its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see &amp; do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NET NEUTRALITY? Net neutrality is the basic principle that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\nWHY VERIZON STORES? The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we\u2019re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\nWHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS? Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we\u2019re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\nHOW CAN I JOIN? Click here http://www.verizonprotests.com/ and you\u2019ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can sign up to host one, and we\u2019ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can\u2019t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by calling your lawmakers and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.\n\n",

AND WE INVENTED THE INTERNET!!! \n\nCheck your phone or internet bill. All those surcharge and fees you pay every month? \n\nMost of that is pure profit for the telecoms they are allowed to keep, because they lied about investing in a fiber optic network nearly 30 years ago and have never been called out on.\n\nOh, btw the FCC redefined 'Broadband' in 2015 to mean 25 mbps. This year, the FCC proposed to lower that definition to just 10mbps.\n\nSo, soon you will be paying for \"Broadband\" speed which is 2.5 times less than it was just two years ago, all while the people continue to pay into a 400 billion dollar fraud for a fiber optic network we will never receive.

But by the early '80s, American society was grappling with some drug problems and opinion had grown against the \"excesses\" of the hippie generation. In 1985, the Rajiv Gandhi government buckled under the pressure and enacted a law called the Narcotic Drugs &amp; Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. \n\n&gt;And suddenly, there was a drugs problem in India. In cities like Delhi, for instance, smack addiction grew.  Newspapers reported cases of men selling off all household goods to get money for a fix. What is significant is that instances of deviant behaviour were rare when marijuana, hashish and bhang were legal.

I'm sure many other countries are gonna try to take away NN, specially if NN passes in USA. This might start a snowball of governmental decisions to remove NN all around the World and India might change their mind if no one has NN.

            "comment": "Also for anyone who tells you that \"Net Neutrality is solving a problem that doesn't exist\"... or anything along those lines:\n\nHere's a brief history on what the internet companies were doing that triggered Net Neutrality to be put in place:\n\nMADISON RIVER:  In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.\n\nCOMCAST: In 2005, the nation\u2019s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.\n\nTELUS: In 2005, Canada\u2019s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.\n\nAT&amp;T: From 2007\u20132009, AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such \u201cover-the-top\u201d voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&amp;T when it came on the scene in 2009.\n\nWINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream\u2019s own search portal and results.\n\nMetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon\u2019s court challenge against the FCC\u2019s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency\u2019s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.\n\nPAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person\u2019s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service\u2019s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. \n\nAT&amp;T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011\u20132013, AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.\n\nEUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. \n\nVERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon\u2019s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.\n\nAT&amp;T: In 2012, AT&amp;T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers\u2019 iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&amp;T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&amp;T\u2019s own products. \n\nVERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency\u2019s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: \u201cI\u2019m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.\u201d Walker\u2019s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.\n\nSource has links to each case where you can read the legal documents about it: https://www.freepress.net/blog/2017/04/25/net-neutrality-violations-brief-history\n",

A lot of the massive tactical failings we see from them are simply these flaws accumulating. They engaged in a blitzkrieg style attack at the outbreak of the war which was shut down very easily due to their complete miscalculations on the military readiness of the Ukrainian army, those initial failings are much less noticeable now that Russia have went back to a more standard modern warfare of artillery and probing offensives (since anti-air capabilities of both sites have shut down any kind of effective aerial superiority).\n\nThe longer the war drags on more competent Russia is going to become, and they have a much bigger military stockpile than that of Ukraine at the moment, alongside a willingness to commit war crimes if it furthers their goals (can't be understated how big of an advantage this gives). Russia still hold the advantage in this war, but the war isn't going to be over in a day or even a year, it's going to take a long time before an armistice is met (which will probably be when/if putin is ousted). The biggest factor that can flip the odds of the war has and will continue to be the massive amounts of intel allies are providing and modern equipment that allow for many more options in plans (storm shadow missiles for long range strategic bombing, HIMARS for aerial denial, ect. It's fair to say Russia won't be repeating a lot of the mistakes it made earlier in the war (like mile long single line formations of armor with zero support).",

They were so far behind the curve in the start of the war that there's no meaningful gains they can make in competency that the West can't help Ukraine deal with, you know? Like... One of our greatest assets in the war effort is near real-time intelligence on every move the Russians are making, which is only possible because of the extreme incompetence and corruption that's become institutional within the Russian military; some of their guys just don't know when to keep quiet, and others have a crazy low \"money-to-loyalty\" ratio. \n\nCoupled with the generations-ahead equipment we're furnishing Ukraine with, there's just no meaningful way for Russia to deal with it. At worst, we'll continue to see light casualties among the Ukrainian personnel and materiel that'll cost the Russians likewise ten-fold.",

Also the siphoning off of an absurd amount of money from Russia but that will never be talked about in Russia. The man grew up poor, worked for the KGB and then became Russia's leader. Given how much he was paid, he should be not very wealthy, but he is somehow one of or possibly even the richest man in the world. The numbers are unconfirmed because his money is so hidden.",

But the truth is that if your soldiers aren't prepared or motivated and thus don't want to be there, then they will be at a disadvantage compared to Ukrainians who genuinely know they're doing the right thing by protecting their country from invaders. As a Finn, this reminds me of the Continuation War, and I certainly hope this goes Ukraine's way just as the Continuation War went Finland's way (even when we technically lost).",

How long will war be popular when it starts to affect people's home lives in a way that most Americans never were.",

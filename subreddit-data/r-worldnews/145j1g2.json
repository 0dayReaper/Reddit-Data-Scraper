Telling kids that it's okay to explore their understanding of their own gender, and to ask questions, is not the same as convincing people they're trans. Puberty blockers aren't given out like candy, they're prescribed by medical professionals in cases where a teen needs more time to figure themselves out. They aren't some horrible poison, they're a medicine, used under medical supervision. Like literally all medicine, maybe they have side effects. The risks from which need to be balanced against the risk of a trans kid growing increasingly hopeless, miserable, and desperate because they don't have access to help they need.\n\nUsing mental gymnastics to make yourself believe everyone who supports the use of puberty blockers is literally \"evil\" doesn't put you in the right. Almost the closest I see to \"evil\" in this world is hate against LGBT+ folk, actually. Because I literally can't think of too many things (short of evoking Godwin \u2022 ) more evil than trying to make people feel bad about themselves, trying to make them hide who they are, just on the basis of either who they fall in love with, or on the basis of how they do, or do not, want to express their gender identity. It's literally attacking young people for being themselves, literally setting out to bully them into conforming. *And it doesn't work*. You won't get fewer trans people by trying to hide information about trans rights from youth. You'll just get more miserable trans people. Now wanting that, is evil. For my part, I'm no saint, but I don't want people to be literally miserable for their whole lives, on the basis of who they are.\n\n* \\- editing this later \u2014 actually, an unfortunate choice of phrasing on my part, given that LGBT people, and trans people specifically, were indeed an early target of the Nazis.",

The point of puberty blockers, setting aside argument about their possible side effects, is precisely to give youth who are wondering if they might be trans more time to figure themselves out. The pro-trans-rights side wants young people to take these decisions seriously and think long and hard about them.\n\nSecondly, \"conversion therapy,\" i.e. trying to convince someone who's trans that they are not, *does not work*. It leads to depression, and misery. Trying to ban trans youth from existing will not, and does not, result in less trans youth. It results in the trans people who do exist in either case, being a lot more miserable... and prone to suicide. \n\nYou say framing this as a fight for existence is \"extreme,\" then you casually propose the pretty dang extreme position that maybe trans advocacy *leads to suicide*. No, it doesn't, and the very fact that this is how far the anti-trans-rights side of the debate is willing to go, sure makes this seem like a fight for existence to me. If I claimed that *just acknowledging the very existence* of some group you belonged to would cause *kids to commit suicide*, you'd be a bit worried, no? \n\nThe reality is that we know pretty well why trans kids commit suicide. Part of it is dysphoria \u2014 and a big part of it is bullying. Telling trans youth that they don't exist, that the way they want to be is somehow wrong and shameful. Anyone, hearing messages like that all around them, would suffer depression and other mental health issues. That's why we need trans advocacy. \n\nAnd that's why I'm suspicious of this whole debate. You can't have a discussion about whether puberty blockers do or do not have side effects without someone just casually strolling up and going \"hey, what if this minority you're trying to defend from harassment is actually the bad guys? And also what if they cause suicide?\"\n\nYeah, that's... pretty damn depressing and upsetting.",

I'm sure they existed, but the rate has gone up DRAMATICALLTY.  The number of people committing suicide who are trans has basically scaled linearly with the number of people identifying as trans- meaning there's likely a contagion effect that's making people identify as trans, then increasing the risk they kill themselves.  If this was the reverse, you'd expect the suicide rate to be LOWER before the rate of identification went up but it's quite the opposite.  If I can reframe this, if we could get out trans identification rate back down to where it was in the 2000s, would there be less suicides after we were successful compared to before?  \n\nLet me preface this before I go to the next part- I'm not a fan of gender affirming surgery for ADULTS, but it's not like it's not happening to kids and it never should. There is not widespread advocacy for that, admittedly, but pretending it doesn't exist and then letting it happen is a pretty bad idea.  We actually come together on this when it comes to female circumcision, it's rare, there isn't really a side \"advocating\" for it, and we insist on banning it and making sure it doesn't happen.  \n\nTo the puberty blockers- I do like that you set aside the side effects argument, which I don't think that is irrelevant but you did acknowledge it (nuance in discussion is always appreciated.  It's not like being on puberty blockers is a neutral choice, and that being off of them is an assault on someone.  If you want to make the case that we ought to be more tolerant and kind to \"unpassable\" people that go through puberty then transition I'm right there with you.  Our bodies' natural development isn't something to pretend is arbitrary and unimportant, and even the idea that being on puberty blockers is somehow \"gender affirming\" is kind of silly even looking at it from the trans side.  I'd also note it's also about other hormones, the big one that seems REALLY dumb to me is putting adolescent girls on testosterone which is a potent mood stabilizer and acting like it's fixing their problems when some vigorous weightlifting would likely have the same effect (and more health benefits.)",

You do realize that significantly less than 1% of the population identifies as trans, right? \n\nAnd unfortunately just recognizing someone as trans is only the first step. There are plenty of hurdles to surmount before they get the help they need, and many of those suicides are of people who don't get past those hurdles.\n\nComparing the US now to 200 years ago or to a different country altogether is moot, because there are significant social/cultural differences that affect overall suicide rate. Hmmm, maybe the increased socioeconomic divide and lack of upward economic mobility is what is driving the suicide rate! Maybe we should blame the rich instead.\n\n&gt; Is your speculation that a massive chunk of the depressed office workers in Japan/Korea are closeted trans?\n\nNot a massive chunk, because again, trans folks are a very small portion of the population, but I'm certain some of them are.",

Therefore, it concluded that, until sound medical evidence was available to establish that the clinical benefits (if any) of the use of puberty blockers outweighed the clinical risks, puberty blockers should not be a routine treatment for children with gender dysphoria.\n\nThe NHS has allowed puberty blockers to continue to be used for eligible children who are enrolled in clinical studies into the effectiveness of puberty blockers as a therapeutic intervention for gender dysphoria to facilitate the collection of the clinical evidence needed to make a decision on whether their use as a routine medical treatment for gender dysphoria should be permitted\n\nThat, I think, is sound medical practice.\n\nI set out below an extract from The Economist article which helpfully summarises the findings of the 2020 NICE Report:\n\n&gt;In 2020 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (nice), a British body which reviews the scientific underpinnings of medical treatments, looked at the case for puberty-blockers and cross-sex hormones. The academic evidence it found was weak, discouraging and in some cases contradictory. The studies suggest puberty-blockers had little impact on patients. Cross-sex hormones may improve mental health, but the certainty of that finding was low, and nice warned of the unknown risks of lasting side-effects.\n\n&gt;For both classes of drug, nice assessed the quality of the papers it analysed as \u201cvery low\u201d, its poorest rating. Some studies reported results but made no effort to analyse them for statistical significance. Cross-sex hormones are a lifelong treatment, yet follow-up was short, ranging from one to six years. Most studies followed only a single set of patients, who were given the drugs, instead of comparing them with another set who were not. Without such a \u201ccontrol group\u201d, researchers cannot tell whether anything that happened to the patients in the studies was down to the drugs, to other treatments the patients might be receiving (such as counselling or antidepressants), or to some other, unrelated third factor.\n https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/04/05/the-evidence-to-support-medicalised-gender-transitions-in-adolescents-is-worryingly-weak\n\nSee also:\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/health-56601386",

I\u2019m reminded of a very beautiful small boy I met several years ago, who loved dancing and creative things and was amused when I mistook him for a girl because of his lovely long shiny hair! He was so happy and confident in himself just as he was, I hope he continued to be. Gender roles that adults unthinkingly dump on children might be something that ought to be addressed not instead of other treatments but as well as. Why should a child feel that they are inadequate in their birth gender because they like or hate contact sports, or bright clothes, arts and crafts, dance or science, or makeup, none of these things should be considered more suitable for one gender or another and yet children pick up adults expectations and assumptions.",

I think it\u2019s worth studying (without restricting entirely) prolonged use of hormone blockers as well as continual use of hormone replacement therapy long term.\n\nIt\u2019s KNOWN the risks and dangers of prolonged hormone use (both testosterone replacement as well as estrogen/estradiol and progesterone. I\u2019d like to see if there is a difference in risks for these hormones long term in opposite bio sex individuals than initial clinical trials were based on. Perhaps there are some limited studies already. I\u2019ll have to look- I may be completely uninformed in the area of practice. \n\nI know as a bio female, hormonal imbalances have been living hell for me. I can\u2019t imagine it any easier for the trans community.\n\nChildren\u2019s brains and endocrine systems are so much different than adults. Perhaps- some caution for long term use isn\u2019t a bad thing? There have been many drugs deemed safe that have instead been instrumental in many aquired conditions  and unintended effects- down to life threatening side effects, organ failure, and in some cases death.",

Sure, there are the physical genitals, but they're not developed or functional, and of course there are no breasts, wide shoulders, enlarged adams apple, heavy facial bone structure, or all those other differences that separate men and women.\n\nPuberty is where the gross physical changes happen in our bodies, that's where we get the basic structural differences that make it visually easy to distinguish between male and female. \n\nIt's easy to say, \"Let them physically transition when they turn 18\", but that's incredibly ignorant because that completely and totally ignores all of the physical changes that puberty causes in bodies, and once those changes happen they're pretty much irreversible. It's not really possible to rebuild the bone structure of someone's face to change their apparent gender, nor to enlarge or shrink the larynx, or to narrow or widen shoulders and pelvises. It's possible to increase someone's height surgically, but it's an incredibly expensive, painful, and years-long process, and is only really available to those with other defects such as from bad injuries or other medical issue that impaired proper long bone growth.\n\nIn other words, once someone's gone through a puberty that does not match their brain gender their transition options become significantly reduced. For the most part, especially for MtF, they'll always be recognized as having a physical gender different than their presented gender, their brain gender. FtM is somewhat less of a problem because surgical removal of breasts is fairly straight forward, but the person will always appear to be effeminate due to reduced stature, narrow shoulder, slight facial bone structure, high voice, wide hips, etc. \n\nThe thing is, children are smart, after all they're us. They may not have as much learned knowledge, but they're exceptional at figuring stuff out and recognizing patterns. That's a basic human trait, BTW. Brain gender seems to start developing as early as three or four, and typically by 10 the child knows what their gender is. The vast majority of the time that matches their body gender, so going through puberty is just part of normal human development. However, for reasons not yet understood, sometimes a child's brain gender, their internal sense of what they are, does not match their body gender. As they get older and start to learn about gender roles and the way humans interact, they begin to realize that something's not right with them, that they don't fit their body. This is called gender dysphoria, and there are decades of science and research on the subject.  \n\nThere are really only two treatment paths available in these cases, try to brainwash the child into believing that their mental gender matches their body gender, or try to set them up so that they can physically transition as an adult efficiently and effectively such that they don't look like their birth gender in any meaningful way. The first option has already been tried with gay people using \"conversion therapy\", mainly in the religious world. It's been tried for decades. It always fails. After all, if you feel like a man how easy would it be to convince you that you're really a woman? To honestly feel like you're a woman in a man body? It would be impossible, and as such trying to convince trans kids that they're not trans has been an abject failure.\n\nThat leaves just physical treatment, and the key to that is making physical transition possible in a way that's not obvious. That's where puberty blockers come in. All of the treatment for gender dysphoria is purely counseling and therapy before puberty begins, so that's several years. During those years of treatment by a battery of doctors and therapists it become obvious when gender dysphoria is real or \"just a passing phase\". Nobody believes a child can pull off a long-con by spending years convincing trained adult scientists that they're trans, so by the time puberty becomes an issue it's pretty clear what the child's future treatment path will be. Puberty blockers, which have a long and incredibly safe history in children and adults, are used to delay puberty a few short years, long enough for the child's mind to become more mature and to really determine, without a doubt, that transition will be the best path of treatment. \n\nOnce the child turns 15-16 or thereabouts it's really plainly obvious that physical transition is the only real option going forward if  you want to end up with a healthy, living, productive adult who is happy. Only then are the puberty blockers stopped and HRT is prescribed. Mind you, it's been over a decade since the beginning of treatment for the child at this point, treatment by a team of highly qualified doctors and therapists. 15-16 is young enough to change the gender of the puberty since there's another several years of maturing for the body to go through. With HRT the person develops the appropriate physical characteristics of their gender, and when they turn 18 the surgical interventions needed will be fairly minimal. Many trans people elect not to get genital surgery, BTW. The fact that their apparent gender matches their brain gender well enough to not appear trans to others is often enough to let them be mentally and physically healthy adults. \n\nHowever, take puberty blockers out of the treatment plan and all the rest of this is lost. Going through the wrong puberty is a horrific experience for most trans people, especially MtF. For the rest of their lives they'll appear very obviously to be trans, and that'll put them at high risk for being killed, harassed, and discriminated against, both in public and in employment. The options for the rest of their life will be severely limited, and by the time they hit their mid teens and puberty has done most of the damage it will do many of these teens, seeing the bleak future fill with hate for them, will choose to end their lives.",

The concept goes back probably as far as homo sapiens do. Hitler notoriously refined the process into an art form along with Goebbels. In fact, Hitler did the same exact thing, made trans people part of the out-group and persecuted them as well as sent many to die in the death camps along with the other out-group targets. In fact, he closed the world's first trans clinic and research facility:\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-forgotten-history-of-the-worlds-first-trans-clinic/\n\n&gt;Adolf Hitler was named chancellor on January 30, 1933, and enacted policies to rid Germany of Lebensunwertes Leben, or \u201clives unworthy of living.\u201d What began as a sterilization program ultimately led to the extermination of millions of Jews, Roma, Soviet and Polish citizens\u2014and homosexuals and transgender people.\n&gt;\n&gt;When the Nazis came for the institute on May 6, 1933, Hirschfeld was out of the country. Giese fled with what little he could. Troops swarmed the building, carrying off a bronze bust of Hirschfeld and all his precious books, which they piled in the street. Soon a towerlike bonfire engulfed more than 20,000 books, some of them rare copies that had helped provide a historiography for nonconforming people.\n&gt;\n&gt;The carnage flickered over German newsreels. It was among the first and largest of the Nazi book burnings. Nazi youth, students and soldiers participated in the destruction, while voiceovers of the footage declared that the German state had committed \u201cthe intellectual garbage of the past\u201d to the flames. The collection was irreplaceable.\n\nIt's greatly disappointing to see that little has changed changed since 1933.",

Puberty still has to happen during the growth phase which typically is over by 18-20. What blockers do is to prevent the gross physical changes of puberty until HRT, if that's determined to be the proper treatment path, is prescribed. Starting HRT as a mid-teen does a good job of making sure the trans person's apparent gender matches their brain gender, and greatly prevents or reduces the need for surgeries once the trans person reaches 18.",

It's *already* a decision made under medical supervision and not made lightly. To figure out if someone is trans or not, they *need* to be allowed to figure out their own gender, not have it dictated to them. The whole point of puberty blockers is to give a youth more time to decide. If you were *actually* worried about the well-being of young people, you'd *want* that. And you'd be a lot more worried about the suicide rate among trans youth, which is caused by dysphoria and bullying that you are now *contributing* to, than you would be about the comparatively mild side effects of puberty blockers.",

Blockers are not a question of \"but what if they change their mind\" because we're not talking about HRT. I don't think people really consider how serious going through the wrong puberty is -- not just their suffering as a teenager, but they will need surgeries to change things that could have been prevented. The majority are never able to afford obtaining these surgeries. Surgeries also cannot fix it all i.e. changing your height or voice and things like top surgery leave life-long scars. The importance of stopping the wrong secondary traits from appearing cannot be understated.",

I think if you're messing with hormones in any way, you should be exempt from participating at a competitive level.\n\nThere are plenty of trans females dominating women's sports, I have yet to see a trans male participate on the same level of professional male athletes. \n\nThe solution is to not allow them to compete, or to set up a separate mixed league in which anyone can compete.\n\nOn the issue of puberty blockers to get around this, there's very little to no evidence that all effects are completely reversible, there's some evidence to suggest that prolonged use can impede brain development, and I'm not sure it's completely ethical to give it to children, although I will admit there are very few studies done in this area, and more studies could be difficult/unethical to do.\n\nI'm not sure what the right answer is here, and obviously it can be a very emotive discussion for some.

We have the technology. It is safe. It is becoming well-understood within the trans community. It is becoming discussed in society. Trans people are earning a degree of acceptance...\n\n...only for a far-right movement to suddenly campaign to snatch it all away for no rational reason at all.  Petty little bullies need someone to beat on so they can feel important and trans people are the target du jour. It's hardly surprising if this leads to increased, totally needless suicides. Honestly, we should really not even think of them as suicides. At this point they're just homicides with extra steps.",

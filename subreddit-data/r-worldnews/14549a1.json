Swedish lawmakers included a prison term of up to four years for individuals convicted of participating in an extremist organization in a way that is intended to promote, strengthen or support the group.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1454n7a/nato_hopeful_sweden_charges_man_with_attempting/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688325 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Swedish**^#1 **Turkey**^#2 **PKK**^#3 **Sweden**^#4 **organization**^#5",

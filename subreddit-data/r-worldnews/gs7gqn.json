I legitimately question how anyone thinks this rift will ever heal, even after Trump is out of office, if he even peacefully leaves and doesn't attempt a coup or election fraud.

That's the hill he's going to war on huh? *{bangs head against keyboard}*\n\nIt's just like White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany defending Trump's attacks on vote-by-mail... yet for the past 10 years **she has voted by mail 11 times.** (*10 times in Florida elections, and once in the state\u2019s March 2020 presidential primary. )*\n\neta:\n\nMy poor inbox.\n\nLook angry ones.. It is so ridiculous that you and I are having to debate over fact-checking what the **President of the United States** says on fucking Twitter. Like Trump tweeting Morning Joe \"may have\" murdered someone... even though that absolutely never happened. Like beyond all doubt. So here we are.\n\nBottom line is go vote in November because if you think 4 years of Trump has fucked America just think what nearly a decade (8 years) of Trump/Kushner/Barr will do.\n\neta2: Wow.. someone gave me bling!

As long as all the big business men are making money... it doesn\u2019t matter what happens to the citizens.\n\nEdit:  was pointed out that CEOs of public companies aren\u2019t really dictatorial because of board members etc...Trump runs his private companies like a dictator, where he\u2019s allowed to because it\u2019s his... not so with a country.",

Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays. \n\nDisdain for the Recognition of Human Rights \nBecause of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc. \n\nIdentification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause \nThe people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc. \n\nSupremacy of the Military \nEven when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. \n\nRampant Sexism \nThe governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy. \n\nControlled Mass Media \nSometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common. \n\nObsession with National Security \nFear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. \n\nReligion and Government are Intertwined \nGovernments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions. \n\nCorporate Power is Protected \nThe industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite. \n\nLabor Power is Suppressed \nBecause the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed . \n\nDisdain for Intellectuals and the Arts \nFascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts. \n\nObsession with Crime and Punishment \nUnder fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. \n\nRampant Cronyism and Corruption \nFascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders. \n\nFraudulent Elections \nSometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.",

But the EO also gives Twitter (and others) a simple out in that it works only on censorship beyond the terms of service. Well, Twitter only allows Trump's tweets to stay up because of their \"public-interest exceptions\" clause, which includes labelling. If they're not allowed to label tweets, then that clause would be removed and Trump's tweets would fall afoul of the \"abusive behavior\" and \"civic integrity policy\" rules that are explicitly included in the TOS, meaning that without labeling, Twitter's only recourse under the TOS would be to start removing Trump's tweets altogether.\n\nTLDR: Toddler throws tantrum, gets his favorite toy taken away while others get to continue playing.",

Meanwhile, fasten your seatbelts because the wheels are going to completely fall off in the next few months. This is all he can do now is to spread conspiracy theories and try to control the media in his favor. Trump's mouth spews the biggest fake news. Prepare for the biggest smear campaign you've ever seen. If everyone/everything appears to be bad, his hope is that you pick the already bad you've had for the last 4 years.

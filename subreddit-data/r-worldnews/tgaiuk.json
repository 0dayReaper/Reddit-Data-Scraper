He would also randomly select travel routes at the last minute, book multiple hotels when travelling and my brother had to sign an NDA saying he wouldn't say where he worked or who owned the place.\n\nWhat is the point in having all that money just to live in a constant state of anxiety?",

A disturbing aspect of Putin's speech is he's framing it to Russians like this is a fight for their own country's existence. He's trying to mobilize the whole country, or at least prepping for that. But the message I heard is that Putin is fighting for his own existence. I predict things are going to get weird and wild in Russia.",

The assessment from the intelligence community is that he's scared,\u201d Copetas said. \n\n&gt; Copetas says that the preferred method of assassination in Russia is poison. \n\n&gt; Putin should know \u2014 it's believed his agents killed outspoken critic Alexander Litvinenko by spiking a pot of tea with radioactive poison in 2006.\n\n&gt; And in 2018, authorities say Putin\u2019s henchmen sprayed deadly poison on the front door of former spy Sergei Skripal. He and his daughter narrowly escaped death.\n\n&gt; Putin also allegedly ordered the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. He survived, but is now languishing in a Russian jail.",

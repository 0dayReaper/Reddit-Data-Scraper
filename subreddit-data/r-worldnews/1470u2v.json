Considering that Ukraine hasn't reached the main Russian line yet, and that Russian doctrine specifically calls for its forward lines to collapse backwards to try and exhaust attackers and expose them to prolonged artillery bombardments, it would be foolish to go all in at this stage.",

But, it does seem like there have been a variety of penetrations of the first and second line of defenses with geolocated footage of Ukrainians a dozen kilometers behind the first Russian positions. With the blowing of the dam it looks very much like Russia is retreating from three towns, because the flood will wipe out the only Russian supply routes to them. Either that or they're abandoning significant forces without the option to reinforce, resupply, or retreat. Which isn't impossible, but I suspect that they aren't *that* willing to throw away higher quality units like that.\n\nNo tank in the world is completely immune to concentrated artillery fire or the top tier of Russian tank. It's very likely that Ukraine lost a couple dozen tanks (including leopards) and armored vehicles already. At the same time, footage of something like 70 destroyed Russian tanks have emerged.\n\nUkraine is going to suffer losses. It's going to get pretty bad. Attacking is always more costly than defending. It's *unlikely* that Ukraine will achieve its maximal aims of reaching the sea and cutting off Crimea in one go. But it's *very likely* that they're close to a more modest breakthrough that will compel Russia to defend an even longer front when the attack runs out of modern western equipment and ammunition. It'll be supplies and equipment because it's clear that Ukrainians do not know either when or how to quit.",

But the tanks have been doing there jobs..many soldiers have been able to escape unscaved because of the protection of the armoured tanks and some of those tanks have even been carted off and being repaired.much rather the soldiers survive to fight another day. We can build and repair tanks.",

The war will play out, how it plays out, regardless of my interpretation of how things are going. \"Damn, we took a beating on this front, if only those people on Reddit weren't lying to themselves, that would have made all the difference!\" See how stupid what you said is? Probably not, just know it is.\n\nThe second part of that is equally stupid. Calling \"lawmakers\" isn't going to do anything. If you live in a country that is already supplying Ukraine, those decisions are already being made.\n\nYou could have suggested donating to one of the many programs out there to aid Ukraine, but instead, you suggested two things that would have literally no impact at all, which is quite ironic.",

That said right now, looking at the photos of destroyed Ukrainian equipment leads me to believe that we are not seeing the main Ukrainian offensive but rather probing attacks. \n\nThe Bradley, for example, is also a Cavalry vehicle and not just an IFV.",

Specially since the Dnipro River Dam was blowned up and water levels have dropped so much that would make such an amphibious attack possible. There are no defense lines blocking such an advance and would be a classic pincer move via land and water.",

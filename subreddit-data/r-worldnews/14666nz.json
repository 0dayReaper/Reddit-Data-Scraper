After Putin and his thugs seized a Russian hotel owned by Canadian businessman Ken Rowe about 20 years or so ago and the corrupt Russian courts wouldn't do anything, Ken Rowe used his contacts in the government to get a Russian oligarchs plane held at a Canadian airport until Putin agreed to pay him his costs for the hotel.",

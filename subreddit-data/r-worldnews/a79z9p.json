Seeing stuff like this thinks conservation programs and zoos will be the *lion's share* of how humans and animals interact. It's hard to imagine we can veer climate change, technology, and exponential human growth into sustainability. I imagine the future of Earth's animal altogether somewhat relies on a concentrated human effort to preserve them.",

I\u2019m a hunter and I can show how the North American model of animal conservation involving hunters has worked, but I just don\u2019t know enough about the politics of Africa to know if trophy hunting is helping preserve habitat or if it\u2019s too corrupt to be trusted and isn\u2019t sustainable. \n\nBut if we\u2019re not doing anything to address the two bigger concerns it\u2019s not going to matter.

The fact that you would do this victory-dance over me like this is very hurtful, and I don't think I'll ever forgive you.\n\nWhile I figure out if I forgive you or not, you will, as a sign that you are truly sorry, explain the reference in full detail for people (who are living under a rock, idiots) who may not get it. In this explanation you will be forthcoming, straightforward and kind. \n\nI await your reply with vigilance and a softening erection. \n\n",

That was quite entertaining.\n\nUnfortunately African elephants are now going the same way, so no doubt we'll all be telling wide-eyed children about these ridiculously massive things that used to exist but now don't. \n\nMammoths still existed when the Great Pyramid at Giza was built. While some person somewhere near the Nile was doing complicated calculations regarding this great big pile of stones they had to get organised, somewhere else on the planet a herd of wooly fucking mammoths was trundling around doing whatever mammoths did.

In the late 19th and 20th centuries herds of 20 to 30 animals were recorded, now on average herd sizes contain fewer than six individuals. The IUCN lists four main threats to this species: habitat loss, civil unrest, illegal hunting, and ecological changes (climate change and habitat conversion). As human populations grow and increase agricultural activities, expand settlements, and construct roads, the giraffe is losing its beloved acacia trees, which are its main source of food.",

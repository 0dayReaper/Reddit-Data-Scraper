This politician - 5 years ago, he and 1 or 2 other party members were accused of being gay, the case hinged on privacy, not slander/sexual-orientation, and the accuser/outer lost it and the appeal because of that, and had to pay some damages to some of the people. The court then didn't have to rule on the guy's hypocrisy, but this week the court of public opinion does get to decide about the naked, bleeding, 'ecstatic' Jozsef Szajer who was feeling a police raid from an orgy of 20+ men.\n\nHe's now #1 on [gayhomophobe.com](https://gayhomophobe.com/) \n\n[\u00c1ron Kov\u00e1cs - Friday, October 30, 2015, 10:09](https://vs.hu/kozelet/osszes/ketmilliot-fizethet-a-kocsis-matet-melegnek-nevezo-ungar-klara-1030#!s0)\n\n*According to the first-instance verdict, Ung\u00e1r must apologize on his own Facebook page and pay a damages of two million forints (plus interest). It has not been established that whether the district mayor was really gay, no one tried to prove it. However, according to the judge, this is not the issue either, the statement was made in an environment that is likely to damage the politician's reputation. Kl\u00e1ra Ung\u00e1r will not accept the verdict, she will appeal.*\n\n*Kl\u00e1ra Ung\u00e1r, a former SZDSZ politician, insulted M\u00e1t\u00e9 Kocsis VIII. district Fidesz mayor had a good reputation when he claimed in May that he was gay - said on Friday the first instance of the Metropolitan Court. According to the verdict, Ung\u00e1r must apologize on his own Facebook page, delete Kocsis' name from the disputed entry, and pay HUF 2 million (plus interest) in damages, as well as litigation costs (HUF 88,900) and fees (HUF 120,000).*\n\n*Judge Peter Fintha-Nagy said in his oral reasoning that the lawsuit was not about anyone being disadvantaged because of their sexual orientation. According to him, the lawsuit was about a claim that M\u00e1t\u00e9 Kocsis is gay, but he does not undertake to do so, and in fact he does not oppose discrimination against other gays. This, in this context, is likely to damage the reputation of a politician, the judge said, but at the same time refrained from asking Hungary to apologize in an MTI statement.*",

I was naive and bc this person seemed harmless (just like super chatty and had SO much energy) I stayed and listened to their stories. Why were they in dc? For a regular gay orgy, he told me. He told me about how many gay orgies happen in dc with politicians and how many closeted gay/anti gay politicians were at those parties. He offered me some weed from his truck and curious to hear more, I followed this man. He got distracted when sorting through some free furniture on the side of the road and pulled two duffel bags full of dildos out of his car, and I headed out. Oh to be a young woman in the city again.",

In the game, 24 is the number given to the deer (veado in Portuguese), an animal that has long been pejoratively associated with gay men.[10][11]\n\nThe jersey number 24 is heavily avoided by male Brazilian athletes, with rare exceptions. Football players, for example, usually reject this number for their jerseys, and may express dissatisfaction when obligated to wear a 24 jersey due to fixed number rules in international competitions.[12]\n\n24 is also used in politics, as many LGBT candidates include 24 in their campaign numbers, to be easily associated with LGBT movement causes.[13] For the same reason, the number is seldom used by heterosexual politicians, whether or not they have an anti-LGBT agenda. In the Brazilian Senate, for example, although there are 81 Senators, no one currently has a cabinet numbered 24, nor a car plate numbered SF-0024 (the Senators' plate options go from SF-0001 to SF-0095, and any available number can be freely chosen).[14]",

He is a representative of the ruling Hungarian Christian democratic party, explicitly calling themselves an \"illiberal democracy\". The same party that people like Steve Bannon used as a model of how right-wing populism could defeat liberals. \n\nFor example, this is the same party that actually first [built a wall \\(or rather a fence\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_border_barrier) in Europe to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the country.\n\nThis is the same party that transformed state media to serve the party and broadcast pro-government propaganda. The same party that through private investors and oligarchs bought out most media outlets within the country effectively making it impossible for Hungarians to inform themselves impartially and as result, these events about the MEP are not broadcasted practically anywhere. If you ever wondered what Trump's presidency would look like in the future, how democracy and its institutions can be slowly destroyed, just look at Hungary.",

[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/worldnews) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

I was in Gilan in the early oughts and found optimism, openness and a sense of future alongside minor animosity toward the Serbs.\nSad to see indications the divide has continued or worsened.",

This is largely because nobody (not even many Kosovars) really liked the KLA and associated groups very much and thought them little better than Serb gangs.  \n\nThey had reckoned without Serbian pride though. No matter who was in charge in Belgrade they couldn't bring themselves admit to any sort of wrongdoing or offer any meaningful autonomy. In fact they just started lobbing threats about like a Glaswegian drunk on a Friday night.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; AMSTERDAM, June 9 - Ancient Crimean gold artefacts that were on show abroad should be returned to Ukraine, and not to Crimea which Russia annexed in 2014, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled on Friday, ending a long tussle over the treasures.\n\n&gt; More than a thousand ancient objects, including a solid gold Scythian helmet and a golden neck ornament from Crimea were on loan to Amsterdam&amp;#039;s Allard Pierson museum when Moscow seized the peninsula from Ukraine.\n\n&gt; The 2021 decision &amp;quot;Struck a fair balance between infringing on the rights of the museums and the interests of the State of Ukraine in protecting its cultural heritage,&amp;quot; the Dutch Supreme Court said.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1457ajh/top_dutch_court_upholds_decision_awarding_crimean/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688344 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Ukraine**^#1 **museum**^#2 **Court**^#3 **decision**^#4 **Crimea**^#5",

So the  question was: if a museum falls under foreign occupation, who has priority in terms of property rights? The museum, or the original country?\n\nIt\u2019s clear what outcome we *feel* is right, but apparently it was not as easy legally speaking.",

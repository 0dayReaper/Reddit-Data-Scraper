I've never met anyone that hates Russia as much as this guy.  Not the average person, mind you, but he grew up and lived around Moscow and considered it a filthy swamp, and he hated the government for their lack of improvement in quality of life.  He'd rant on and on for hours about how awful Moscow was and how living there was just the worst thing he can imagine.  Coming to America redefined his life, and his daughter was able to grow up publicly as a lesbian, get married, and have multiple kids while having no problems with acceptance here in California that would be challenging back in Russia (or, being honest, in the shittier parts of the US).",

Of those 40k people about half was evacuated, however when local law enforcement fled, evacuation started to be very expensive because of bribes, not to mention dangerous because of looters. About 15k people are left there. So yeah, let's kill 15k people to probably hit 70 people strong Ukraine supported group. The best part? That group didn't reach Shebekino. Those reports were about looters in paramilitary clothes (camo cargo pants etc).",

A court of law decides whether they did it (innocent till proven guilty, even for scumbags) then the news can report on it as a certainty. In this case there is still argumentative disputes over who blew up the dam, so \"Zelensky says\" is their way of trying to maintain some semblance of credibility and insulate themselves if the report turns out to be wrong even if we have absolute proof. \n\nUsed to be, especially for local news like your newspaper, had to follow these rules RIGOROUSLY. It's kinda like how doctors and scientists have to say stuff like \"this is probably what's happening\" or \"You'll very likely to survive\" instead of \"this is exactly what's happening\" or \"you're definitely going to survive\".

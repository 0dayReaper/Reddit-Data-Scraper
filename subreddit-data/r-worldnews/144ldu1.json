It's based off the mos6502, we've had decades of experience with that architecture. At its core, it's still binary driven, i.e. 1s and 0s. \n\nQuantum computing is a completely novel architecture. We barely know enough to make any practical use cases. Its architecture is completely different to the traditional binary system. A binary bit can not be both a 1 and 0, but quantum can. \n\nThe machines used to simulate quantum architecture are so powerful and complex that any claim to have a quantum machine that can fit in one's hand is laughably untrue.",

You can do so to arbitrary binary precision, but the result will not be a true _real number_ any more than you can hold pi (in its entirety, as a real number) in computer memory.\n\n&gt; You can play Nintendo games on non Nintendo computers.\n\n\"Quantum\" isn't a brand, it's a physical descriptor (in this case, of a particular means of computation).\n\n&gt; You can simulate fluid dynamics on stuff that's far away from any fluid\n\nThat's correct. Fluid dynamics is a description of an algorithm's _purpose_, while quantum is a description of a _means of execution_.",

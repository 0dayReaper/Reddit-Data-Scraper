He faces the issue with the attitude of a soldier before that of a politician, and considering the rather hesitant, unsure, non-committal and spineless nature of many modern Western politicians - I think this is an attitude needed in the room during a time of crisis like the one we find ourselves in. He also seems happy and capable of putting aside factional politics in order to pursue the greater objective of security - as his cooperation with His Majesty's Opposition, as well as the European Union, US and other key partners and their consistent praise for his performance proves. \n\nSo, while I detest the man's personal politics in many areas, I still think he is one of, if not **the**, best candidate for the next head of NATO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n..........and given that his party will soon be out of power, he will likely be readily available for the post.",

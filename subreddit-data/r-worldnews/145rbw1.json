The older siblings managed to not only survive for one and a half months in one of the most dangerous environments on the planet, they managed to keep a baby alive and a 4 year old entertained the whole time without an iPad.. \n\nReally makes my day to hear happy news like this, restored faith in humanity.. Hope they get a really good documentary deal later for a buttload of cash. I want to hear and see those stories..",

It's hard to imagine what those children must have gone through, but I'm glad they were able to survive for 40 days on their own. I hope they receive the support and care they need to recover from this traumatic experience.",

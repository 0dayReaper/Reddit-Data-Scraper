Then once they reach the end of what they cam do the consequences catch up.

You could have had play time, sports, social life, etc. along with academics and not felt awkward. \n\nThe problem with bright kids is often not pressure from parents or teachers, but simply that they don\u2019t fit in with the less-bright kids and adults don\u2019t know how to stimulate their minds to prevent excruciating boredom while also managing the social difficulties. \n\nWithout meaning to, they can also be mean to the less bright kids, just because its hard to avoid blurting out \u201cyou\u2019re dumb\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s dumb\u201d to others in the course of playing a game or pretend play.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll feel better one day.

The education system is designed to teach the average person who needs repetition and various explanations to remember and understand new concepts.\n\nCondensing multiple years of busywork does not help them but causes unnecessary stress. Most of the topics are learned the very first time it is simply read, or even can be inferred without any formal education at all.\n\nThen the children realize they are simply doing this for shallow ego purposes or to eventually be able to provide labor for some corporations to profit off of.\n\nYou are also correct in that it is incredibly isolating to be othered even in what is seemingly a positive way.",

If you allowed people to take final exams at any time with full time exemptions I\u2019m sure you would see tons of people graduating early artificially. \n\nThe other point of university is to gain life experience and connections. The amount of undergrads that enter the workforce as naive qualified grads is massive, and the importance we place on degrees as a measure of ability is misguided. This girl is smart but peerless, and won\u2019t have the network necessary to succeed professionally on the same level as her co-graduates.",

Treating the first tumor that arose often prevented the occurrence of future tumors.\n\nOne agent is already approved for human use and the other has been tested in other unrelated clinical trials. A clinical trial was launched in January to test the effect of the treatment in patients with lymphoma.",

Similarly there are tumour suppressor genes responsible for destroying rumours that when inactivated drive cancer development. Also once you have a cancer tumour growing you can transplant it to other mice and certain routes of administration will usually lead to tumours developing in certain areas. Oncogenesis can also be achieved by good old mutagenesis such as radiation. Don\u2019t quote me on this cause this isn\u2019t my area of expertise, just some knowledge I have my biomedical science degree.",

Intratumoral injections are easy in mice with subcutaneous tumors but are much, much, much harder in human patients. \n\nEdit: I've gotten more responses than I thought I would, so a couple of things ... I don't want to crap on this study. It's incredibly promising. My only point is that we should always be wary of studies in mouse models of disease, especially studies with cohorts as small as 90 mice. For example, my lab has developed radiotherapeutics that have \"cured\" colorectal carcinoma in ~200/200 mice. We were incredibly excited about this agent, but we ran into problems during clinical translation. Sometimes life (and science) is like that. This is exciting, but it's preliminary. Also, another thing to consider is that intratumoral injections are all fine and good when it's a single, non-disseminated, primary tumor. This, obviously, isn't always the case. ",

The tumour, though, is able to suppress the activities of the T cells so that they don't destroy it.  What you end up with is a reservoir of T cells in the tumour that are trained to recognise the cancer, but are unable to do anything about it.\n\nThe treatment involves injecting two agents into a tumour that turns the T cells back on.  You now have a reservoir of tumour-busting T cells that kill the tumour, but are also able to travel through the blood stream to other secondary tumour sites and kill those tumours as well.\n\nIt seems like it doesn't matter what kind of cancer it is, so long as the tumour has been invaded by T cells, once re-activated, those T cells will destroy that cancer anywhere in the body.",

You can inject all the interleukins you want but if there aren't T cells there, nothing is going to happen. The other issue is that cancer cells can hide from immune cells, basically losing markers on their surface that T cells need to react with. If you are interested, read up on CAR T cells. Personally I believe that these are the most promising of the immunotherapies being researched at  the moment. ",

This is a **very simplified rundown** for people that don\u2019t know what cancer is and why treatment is so damn complicated and often sad. I encourage everyone here to add more details, however, my main objective is to provide an accessible way for those with less health literacy rather than an in-depth discussion on pathological changes:\n\n\nTo answer /u/PuzzleheadedWindow, Yep. Your body is made up of tons of cells and many different kinds at different locations; some divide and replace really fast (skin) whereas others don't (like neuronal cells in the brain). Whereas some cells respond to viruses and other bad stuff by dividing really really fast and producing things like antibodies to fight stuff off. \n\nCancer is your own cells going haywire and dividing into more numbers **uncontrollably** and/or changing (differentiating) into other types of cells that aren\u2019t supposed to be some place. Likewise, cancer is also a cell that is unable to differentiate into a more mature form of a cell that stops growing when it needs to stop! With that said, you do need to know that many researchers have defined terms like \"malignant (this is cancer, it invades the tissue barriers of your body)\" or \"benign (technically this is not cancer, no invasion)\" or \"metastasis (cancer spreading elsewhere)\" to describe what is happening -  I urge everyone to type in terms they don't understand in the [National Cancer Institute \\(cancer.gov\\)](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms). It is a very good resource. With that said, any cell that deviates from what it\u2019s supposed to do at a location in your body can be cancerous, benign, or manifest into other diseases not related to cancer (it really depends on the situation).\n\nNormally your immune system responds to little signals and receptors on cells to kill these cells before they start misbehaving from being damaged. Antibodies or immune cells will find them, and then program it to kill itself. Or those misbehaving cells will recognize something is wrong and kill itself. Keep in mind, there are TONS of different cancers and different causes for each type. My example below is a form of leukemia/cancerous immune cells.\n\nAnything that changes the way your cells function can cause cancer or predispose you to cancer! You may be predisposed because of genetic variations in DNA from birth and likewise, cancer can occur from repeated damage from UV light, Xrays or toxic materials damaging DNA. Signals from other cells during something like inflammation can also harm your cells. Changes at the level of DNA (which is basically the instructions that your cells live, adapt, and multiply by) is the reasoning for cancer - u/mojosam is absolutely correct. To be more specific, all of these insults to the cell causes eventual changes in the cell's metabolism and function, or may even cause changes that prevent the cell from repairing *correctly*. Even bacteria (the prime example is *Helicobacter pylori* which causes stomach ulcers) can cause cancer by changing the environment in your stomach and constantly damaging those cells lining the stomach. Other examples include toxic materials like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) that might cause something called angiosarcoma in your liver.\n\n** Viruses are a big one too.** That\u2019s why so many immunocompromised patients, AIDS/HIV or transplant patients will be at higher risk for cancers. The moment your immune system fails or changes for the worse, you\u2019re predisposed to greater cancer risk. But at the same time, your immune system itself is made up of cells too. And to fight off viruses and bacteria, it actually does this by creating many more cells (the whole army to mount an attack) to flood your body with antibodies and cells to eat the foreign things. You can imagine, if that mechanism of proliferating cells happens but then some trigger, genetics, or toxins disabled its ability to turn off, then you get a ton of cells multiplying uncontrollably. It becomes cancer; this example I described is leukemia. This is only one type of cancer and one mechanism that it came from. There are MANY other types of cancers like in the esophagus, you have constant damaging of the cells so much that they begin to adapt by changing into another type of cell(dysplasia, not cancer yet), which might be the first steps in cancer actually arising but you might be able to prevent it here. \n\nThere are so many ways that cancer can arise. That is the problem with cancer. It really is just your cells with broken instructions and messed up ways of regulating itself that all it's trying to do is survive and avoid dying, whether that means stealing all the nutrients from your entire body (large losses in weight may signify cancer), breaking off and traveling to another area in the body (metasizing). It is programmed to survive at any cost and it won't listen to anything telling the cell to recycle itself/die; you can imagine some are much more aggressive, some stay localized, or some have absolutely abysmal successful treatment based on where it is, like pancreas. Depends on context and cell type.\n\n\nSo what do you treat and why is treatment so complicated? For the case of leukemia I described above, Immune cells right? Well immune cells come from a cell that shares its origin with your red blood cells too. If you\u2019re not precise, you blow up your bone marrow and you\u2019re unable to make RBCs. You will no longer be able to transport oxygen in your body and will require a bone marrow transplant. But wait, that *bone marrow makes immune cells too* and it doesn\u2019t recognize your body because it\u2019s someone else\u2019s; that\u2019s why you need immunosuppressants because your body is now foreign to new immune cells made by the donor's bone marrow. But by suppressing your new immune cells, you can\u2019t protect yourself from old beat up, aging cells that might change into cancer or viruses that might mutate your cells. It\u2019s an awful cycle.\n\n\nSo the tricky part about all these therapies and the need for people wanting more \u201cprecise\u201d cancer treatments is that you need to know what and how you\u2019re killing cells, plus whether it will kill just those matured cells or also younger cells that it originated from. \n\nI can't stress this enough, but cancer treatments are poisons designed to kill. Older treatments are practically nukes and kill indiscriminately or favor cells that rapidly divide/grow. Newer treatments are more like stealth missiles that target receptors specific to cancer... but remember, you\u2019re a human. A living thing with cells that have gotten to 2018 by adapting to an environment or exposures. You can imagine that you already have mechanisms in your cell that prevent itself from being affected by treatments. If my drug targets receptor A that causes the cancer cell to die, all the cancer cells with receptor A will die... but it\u2019s dividing so damn fast and randomly that it doesn't manage to kill another cell type with an A-version 2.0 that ignores your drug. Just like you, cancer can adapt and survive against its environments because... it is you. Sadly, that's why you often hear people say, \"it's a matter of killing the cancer before killing the patient.\" However, researchers and clinicians are trying to get to the point of not nukes or missiles, but to super sniper precision laser-like treatments that leave you alone and only get the cancer. [CAR T-cell therapy](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/research/car-t-cells) is a good example of how far we've gotten, but we need to get further.\n\nTldr- cancer is your own cells gone haywire and because it\u2019s your cells, it can adapt and survive like you do. Things damage it's DNA or proteins ultimately causing it to lose the ability to kill itself, or repair correctly. It will continue to divide uncontrollably and even change itself or how it functions. Treatment is very difficult just because \"how can I kill something so similar to me, without killing me?\", but look how far we've gotten over the years with [survival rates from the NIH.gov](https://report.nih.gov/NIHfactsheets/ViewFactSheet.aspx?csid=75). Other than all the complicated balancing of therapy, sometimes you just can't get them all and so it doesn't work. But, there's a lot of researchers working on new methods/mechanisms and I'm pretty optimistic about future treatments.\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold, and I had no idea this would be on r/bestof. I\u2019m glad to help and teach when/where I can but please don't stop learning because in my personal opinion, if this is on r/bestof it should only be on because it raises awareness. This is nowhere near what is required to explain how cancer works and I challenge everyone here to improve each other's health literacy by asking the experts for explanations at your own level. I'm the lowest on the totem pole here as a medical student. I am not an expert, but there are fantastic PhDs and med personnel here that can much better answer what this brief comment fails to answer.",

Sometimes the scientists must sound like they\u2019ve made breakthroughs to keep receiving grants to continue research. Once something has been scrutinized and peer-reviewed and confirmed independently many times over, then it must enter human trials. The trial period may take years to ensure safety. I am a firm believer that if someone\u2019s options are death/suffering and no quality of life, that ANY treatments should be available for them no matter how little research. If they literally have no tolerable alternative, let them try anything! ",

Cancer tumors are masses of cells that stemmed from a single cell which randomly mutated to acquire the following basic characteristics:\n\n1. **Unrestricted cell cycle**. Normally cells self-limit their growth to only divide every X number of hours (depending on the type of cell). Cancer cells have mutations that disable this limitation, so they replicate without hindrance and grow quickly to a tumor.\n\n2. **Evasion of the immune system and apoptosis.** The reality is that many cells in your body mutate randomly in such a way that they could become tumors, but your immune system (or the cell itself) recognizes this and destroys these faulty cells (or the cell commits suicide -- called apoptosis). In order to become a tumor, early cancer cells need to be able to evade these natural defenses.\n\nThis combination of lack of limitation in growth and evasion of the immune system and apoptosis is pretty much the basic molecular definition of cancer.\n\nEDIT: To answer your question more specifically... By the time a tumor is sizable enough to notice, it's already gone *far* past the point of being able to be noticed by the immune system. Faulty pre-cancerous cells are usually destroyed generally before they can divide even once. The cool thing about this research is they seem to have found a way to get immune cells to say \"Oh shit, these cells are cancerous!\" even after the cells have grown into a full blown tumor, and trigger its natural defense mechanism that I talked about above.\n\nEDIT2: Ok I don't think I deserved gold for this extremely basic explanation of tumorigenesis, but thank you kind stranger. People have noted that I left out a lot, and that's true. Cancer and its treatment are very complex subjects that require a lot more understanding than a reddit comment can give you; so if you're interested, go learn more!",

Cancer happens when a tumor actually manages to get the right combination of mutations to tell the immune system to sod off.\n\nAll of your body cells have in their DNA a full blueprint of all of the proteins in your body, but most of the genes are turned off so that cells can specialize at certain tasks and kill themselves when they're no longer working at maximum efficiency. Cancer basically turns cheat codes on to make whatever they want, like stealing an immune cell's ability to not be killed by other immune cells, stealing a bone cell's ability to break through collagen fibers and migrate around, stealing a stem cell's ability to replicate forever, etc.",

            "comment": "OK, so it's important to pump the brakes here a bit - let's go over a few major major caveats to this study.\n\n1. This technique only works if T cells are already infiltrated into a tumor large enough to be injected - T cells are very bad at getting into solid tumors, largely because tumors tend to rapidly evolve mechanisms to specifically prevent this from happening. Frankly, if the T cells were able to get into the tumor in the first place, there are probably enough neoantigens there that this injection is not even necessary. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4794755/) have been done in other resistant cancers and there's a significant survival benefit from just getting the relevant cells there in the first place, which is a step that this study neglects to address.\n2. Mouse cancer models are generally terrible. The authors here are arguing that their treatment works well when the tumors are implanted and then treated (the A20 model). This does not reflect actual cancer development, since the cancer doesn't pop up in the relevant context of an active immune system (i.e. cancer is grown in a dish then put in, it is much more sensitive to enhanced host immune responses since it never learned how to cope with the baseline host immune system while it was evolving).\n3. From the paper itself: \"We have developed a practical strategy for immunotherapy of cancer. It takes advantage of the preexisting T cell immune repertoire within the tumor microenvironment.\" Practically there is often no preexisting T cell immune repertoire within tumor microenvironments. These cells have been suppressed already.\n4. On a more practical level, if this was a serious breakthrough it would have been published in Science proper instead of in one of its offshoots.\n\nSource - PhD in Microbiology and Immunology",

T-regs maintain our immune system's sense of 'self' and prevents pathological self-reactivity (i.e. autoimmune diseases). However, when recruited by cancerous growths, tumors hijack this feature (akin to stealing the body's sense of 'self' and camouflaging as 'self' cells). The reason why this paper's approach is effective because they are able to simultaneously inhibit tumor infiltrated T-regs (i.e. getting rid of the 'self' signal) and activate effector T-cell function (immune system soldiers). They force tumor-associated T-regs to express a receptor, inject the antibody to said receptor so they aggregate at the tumor site. Effector T-cells nearby are then stimulated by antibodies to OX40 and initiates the rest of the immune response. \n\nI do agree that its major limitation is the direct injection aspect (which they acknowledged right out in the discussion) but it is a truly elegant system they've set up.

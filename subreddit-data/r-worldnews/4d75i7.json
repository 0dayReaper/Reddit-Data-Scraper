Its as much improving as winning the lotto is earning money by hard work.\n\nthe problem was never the journalist,, kinda hard to be too investigative, when so much access is closed off, whistleblower laws silence people and the industry just doesnt fund investigation journalism.. its more expensive than trash and yet you make the same money for trash. This is free non trash for the price of trash.\n\n\n",

These shell firms enable their owners to cover up their business dealings, no matter how shady.\n\nIn the months that followed, the number of documents continued to grow far beyond the original leak. Ultimately, SZ acquired about 2.6 terabytes of data, making the leak the biggest that journalists had ever worked with. The source wanted neither financial compensation nor anything else in return, apart from a few security measures.\n\nThe data provides rare insights into a world that can only exist in the shadows. It proves how a global industry led by major banks, legal firms, and asset management companies secretly manages the estates of the world\u2019s rich and famous: from politicians, Fifa officials, fraudsters and drug smugglers, to celebrities and professional athletes.\"",

            "comment": "In Iceland, the leaked files show how Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson and his wife secretly owned an offshore firm that held millions of dollars in Icelandic bank bonds during that country\u2019s financial crisis .\n\nThe files include a convicted money launderer who claimed he\u2019d arranged a $50,000 illegal campaign contribution used to pay the Watergate burglars, 29 billionaires featured in Forbes Magazine\u2019s list of the world\u2019s 500 richest people and movie star Jackie Chan, who has at least six companies managed through the law firm.\n\nefore dawn on Nov. 26, 1983, six robbers slipped into the Brink\u2019s-Mat warehouse at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport. The thugs tied up the security guards, doused them in gasoline, lit a match and threatened to set them afire unless they opened the warehouse\u2019s vault. Inside, the thieves found nearly 7,000 gold bars, diamonds and cash.\n\n\u201cThanks ever so much for your help. Have a nice Christmas,\u201d one of the crooks said as they departed.\n\nBritish media dubbed the heist the \u201cCrime of the Century.\u201d Much of the loot - including the cash reaped by melting the gold and selling it - was never recovered. Where the missing money went is a mystery that continues to fascinate students of England\u2019s underworld.\n\nNow documents within Mossack Fonseca\u2019s files reveal that the law firm and its co-founder, J\u00fcrgen Mossack, may have helped the conspirators keep the spoils out of the hands of authorities by protecting a company tied to Gordon Parry, a London wheeler-dealer who laundered money for the Brink\u2019s-Mat plotters.\n\n On Feb. 10, 2011, an anonymous company in the British Virgin Islands named Sandalwood Continental Ltd. loaned $200 million to an equally shadowy firm based in Cyprus called Horwich Trading Ltd.\n\nThe following day, Sandalwood assigned the rights to collect payments on the loan - including interest - to Ove Financial Corp., a mysterious company in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nFor those rights, Ove paid $1.\n\nBut the money trail didn\u2019t end there.\n\nThe same day, Ove reassigned its rights to collect on the loan to a Panama company called International Media Overseas.\n\nIt too paid $1.\n\nIn the space of 24 hours the loan had, on paper, traversed three countries, two banks and four companies, making the money all but untraceable in the process.\n\nFamily members of at least eight current or former members of China\u2019s Politburo Standing Committee, the country\u2019s main ruling body, have offshore companies arranged though Mossack Fonseca. They include President Xi\u2019s brother-in-law, who set up two British Virgin Islands companies in 2009.\n\nThe leaked files show the firm regularly offered to backdate documents to help its clients gain advantage in their financial affairs. It was so common that in 2007 an email exchange shows firm employees talking about establishing a price structure - clients would pay $8.75 for each month farther back in time that a corporate document would be backdated.\n\nThe world\u2019s best soccer player, Lionel Messi, is also found in the documents. The records show Messi and his father were owners of a Panama company: Mega Star Enterprises Inc. This adds a new name to the list of shell companies known to be linked to Messi. His offshore dealings are currently the target of a tax evasion case in Spain.\n\n",

This will be a huge hit for several large figures in world sports, politics and economy. Names like Lionel messi, Vladimir Putin and the prime minister of Iceland are already leaked. I am curious to see who turns up as well. What a leak!! All coordinated by German newspaper namely the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. As op linked to\n\nBefore reading further: \nHere is a nice ELI5 of shell company procedures and how they work written by /u/Jaredlong:\n\n&gt;Taxes sure do suck, right? Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn't pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can \"spend\" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.\n\n*pls note that this is a subjective ELI5 and there are indeed some reasons/scenarios where shell companies operate for legit reasons! (thanks /u/Toppo) [orig. comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4d75i7/26_terabyte_leak_of_panamanian_shell_company_data/d1og7kz)*\n\nEdit: 'Die Zeit' another big German newspaper writes that about 200k  letterbox companies (in total 11.5 million records) are disclosed... Jesus what is going on. This will be big news for the next few weeks (hopefully longer than that!)\n\nEdit2: the icij had released a YouTube video [here:](https://youtu.be/F6XnH_OnpO0) which sums up what is in those documents. (Even if someone is speaking in the video very calm there is really disturbing stuff in there like people trafficking and sex slavery etc...)\n\nEdit3: [here](https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs)  are some graphs generated from the data showing it goes back to the 80s. The official site is very informative and what is in there. I guess they will also have them for download somewhere...\n\nedit4:\n\nbig hands to /u/AsshatVik composing the list of head of states (as /u/kaisermatias said, most of the names on the list are head of governments not head of states...):\n    \n    The 12 heads of state are:\n\n    Mauricio Macri, president or Argentina.\n\n    Bidzina Ivanishvill. ex PM of Georgia\n\n    Sigmundur something something, PM of Iceland.\n\n    Ayad H. Allawi, ex PM of Iraq.\n\n    Ali Abu-Ragheb, ex PM of Jordan.\n\n    Hamad Jasim J.M. Al-Thani, ex PM of Qatar.\n\n    Sheik Al-Thani, Emir of Qatar.\n\n    HRH Prince Salman, King of Saudi Arabia\n\n    Ahmad Al-Nirghani, ex-president of Sudan\n\n    Sultan Al-Nahyan, president of the UAE.\n\n    Pavlo Lazarenko, ex-PM of Ukraine.\n\n    Petro Poroshenko, president of Ukraine.\n\n    Update of /u/AsshatVik\n\n    Mohammed VI of Morocco might also be involved. Mossack Fonseca created the company to which his personal yatch is registered.\n\n\n    Family members of Ilham Aliyev, president of Azerbajan also used Fonseca to manage mining and real estate investments.\n     \n\n    8 High echelon communist party members of People's Republic of China also used their services. Xi Jinping is amongst them, who's linked to two businesses in the British Virgin Islands.\n\n\n\n\n\nedit 5:\n[here](https://projects.icij.org/panama-papers/power-players/?lang=en) you have a nice website where also Relatives/associates of country leaders of people on the list are listed (which themselves are again on the list)\n\n\n\n*obligatory: THANKS FOR THE GOLD STRANGERS!!*\n\n\n\nedit 6: **For all germans**. There are germans on the list. No politicians (or other high stake figures) but new evidence on the siemens scandal (from the top of my head I don't know which he was referring to..;D) for example. Mossak Fonseca is helping germans massively in the act of tax evasion.  There is not a single german bank not on the list except \"Sparkasse\" etc... (those who are more or less government affiliated) **for non germans** not all names are already leaked since the journalists give those on the list the opportunity to comment on the accusation. (as seen with the pm of iceland)\n\n\n**edit 7: [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/wp1fvdxxwb45/)**",

Let me explain. When the Icelandic economic meltdown occurred in 2008, the three commercial banks operating in Iceland were nationalised, and subsequently made insolvent. For reasons that I won\u2019t get into here, many foreign parties, including hedge funds, had large deposits in the banks. One of those parties was Anna Sigurlaug, via her offshore company. She had registered claims in the bankrupt estate in the amount of nearly half a billion Icelandic kr\u00f3nur (just over USD 4 million).\n\n[...]\n\n&gt; When the PM was campaigning, his main election promise, and indeed THE promise that single-handedly led to his Progressive Party getting elected, was that he would offer debt relief to homeowners whose mortgages had skyrocketed in the meltdown.\n[...], and the Progressive Party won the elections. Within weeks they had fulfilled, not their main election promise, not the one that had propelled them into office, but a scheme that removed taxes on the elite \u2013 most notably the fishing moguls, who are Iceland\u2019s version of Megacorp Inc. [...] \n\n&gt; Then, just when everyone had nearly given up hope on the debt relief package, the PM announced that it was, indeed, forthcoming. Albeit with slight amendments. No negotiations had been entered into with the vultures, in the end \u2013 but not to worry! The plebs would get their debt relief, only it was a much smaller package than envisioned (ISK 80 billion) and it would be funded by \u2026 um, well \u2026 the taxpayers. Including the people who did not own homes and would not be getting any debt relief. Including the young people of this country. Including the old and infirm. But the promise was fulfilled! \u2013 And the government proceeded to congratulate itself profusely on its fantastic successes in the field of debt relief.\n",

These company structures are designed to work within existing legal frameworks. The money isn't simply stashed away, it's moved in order to use existing tax laws.\n\nThe big difference is in the concept of tax *avoidance*, which is legal, and tax *evasion*, which is not.\n\nIn theory, it is everyone's obligation to pay the *correct* amount of tax, not the *maximum* amount of tax, which is where most of these threads come off the rails. Most individuals and all small businesses use deductions to reduce the amount of tax they pay, with for example a truck or computer being amortized, or business expenses being deductible. The larger and more complex the business is, the more economical it is to go for more complex versions of that concept, and that's where these off-shore companies come in. \n\nIf this Panamanian company and the tax lawyers involved are doing their jobs right, then no-one will be charged as a result of this. In theory, everything will be legal. The question societies now have to face is *should* this be legal? If the answer is no, then the answer is to change their domestic tax laws. ",

Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to increase spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can \"spend\" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden. ",

Or maybe, if you really want to show support, go full activist and attend rallies, protests, volunteer movements, etc..\n\nCorruption is an inherent flaw in the system.

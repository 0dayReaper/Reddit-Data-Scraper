And that day was only the peak of a few years of Murphy doing crazy shit.\n\nBy that point Murphy was a 2nd LT by battlefield promotion and by merit of the silver stars he'd earned. He manned that burning M10's .50 several times over an hour to cover his own troop's movements and killed or wounded dozens of Germans doing it.\n\nAt some point he was shot in the leg, earning his third or fourth Purple Heart in less than three fucking years, I can't remember. But he manned the .50 until he ran out of ammo. Then he retreated from the M10 (cue \"Cool Guys Don't Look At Explosions\") falling back to his troops. They wanted to take him to a field hospital but he refused and stayed there to direct his troops while corpsmen patched him up. \n\nMurphy got the Medal of Honor for that. There ain't many people who lived to receive it. Almost 80 years later and he's still the most highly decorated US soldier ever.",

Rather than call another aid man from cover, he cared for his own injuries and waited five hours before litter bearers reached him and started carrying him to cover. The trio was caught in an enemy tank attack and Private First Class Doss, seeing a more critically wounded man nearby, crawled off the litter and directed the bearers to give their first attention to the other man. Awaiting the litter bearers' return, he was again struck, this time suffering a compound fracture of one arm. With magnificent fortitude he bound a rifle stock to his shattered arm as a splint and then crawled 300 yards over rough terrain to the aid station.",

The movie shows Doss dodging a Japanese sniper attack by throwing his helmet.  In reality, the Japanese sniper survived the war and testified that he had Doss in his sights 3 times and his rifle jammed all 3 times.\n\nSimply no audience would ever believe that actually happened.",

The plane had crashed in 2021 and been rebuilt by non aviation professionals and the hired pilot had until recently been a taxi driver. However given how remote their region was, this was one of the only options they had. The Indigenous man with them had been suspicious about the circumstances and decided to go with them to be sure they were safe and actually reconnecting with the father.

She went to private school in an actual city and was flying back into the jungle on Christmas break or some other holiday break. The plane broke up in midair, and she survived by whirling around in a thunderstorm cloud until she fell into jungle vines. Amazing. She was in her teens, her parents were biology hippies living in the jungle, and she followed a river stream. Pretty basic survival for her (after falling out of the sky).",

But by 12 a girl could cook a full meal, gather firewood and carry it home on her head, do the family laundry by hand, and watch the baby full time including making and feeding it food. \n\nIf they were indigenous and knew where to look, the Amazon has a surprising amount of food. Bananas, tubers, cashew (fruit and nut), and fish and birds (and bird eggs).",

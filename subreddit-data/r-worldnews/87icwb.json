            "comment": "Highlights:\n\n&gt;This extension helps you control more of your web activity from Facebook by isolating your identity into a separate container. This makes it harder for Facebook to track your activity on other websites via third-party cookies.\n\n&gt;Mozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We only know the number of times the extension is installed or removed.\n\n&gt;If you use your Facebook credentials to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials, it may not work properly and you may not be able to login. Also, because you\u2019re logged into Facebook in the container tab, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook container tab will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity. So it may look different than what you are used to seeing.\n\n&gt;What does Facebook Container NOT protect against?^1\n\n&gt;It is important to know that this extension doesn\u2019t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on\u00a0facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.\u00a0\n\n\n[Download Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/)(for Firefox users)^2\n\nEdits: 1,2",

For one, it renders images much better than Chrome (sharper and more detail), but it's also more efficient.\n\nAnother cool feature is that if you also download Firefox for iOS and/or Android (and I recommend you do) you can send yourself a tab between devices as well as other sync and sharing functions that are wonderful to have.  I find myself doing this thing a lot where I'm browsing on my phone and I want to send myself something for when I get home (like a new Skyrim mod or whatever) so I just send myself the tab.  I usually forget about it by the time I get home, but when I open my browser at home to go on Reddit or whatever all of the sudden it opens the Skyrim Mod page I had looked at earlier.\n\nI honestly can't recite the rest of the technical reasons why without re-researching them, but it honestly feels like a generational leap in browsers over current Chrome and I highly encourage everyone to give it a fair try.",

For others, it might have been Chrome's impact on their laptop's battery life, or the way it loves to eat ram, but chances are most people are just going to carry on using Chrome as long as it works.

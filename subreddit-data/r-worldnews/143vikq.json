He said state and territory governments can enforce that ban in a more effective way.",

Both the nazis and the warcriminals are on the loose in the Australian military. \n\nAlso none of them were punished or faced any jail time, in fact they blew up the house of one of the whistleblowers and conveniently didnt catch who did it\n\n&gt;In November 2020, the house of a former Army intelligence officer who had provided the Brereton inquiry and Australian Federal Police with evidence of unlawful killings by the SASR was attacked and damaged. She and her family were relocated by the ADF later that day. The New South Wales Police Force was unable to identify who carried out the attack, and apologised to the victim for bungling the investigation.[34]\n\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-26/defence-relocates-war-crimes-witness-after-blast/100407172",

Australian legislation broadly doesn't like to write out every single thing in every law, but instead relies on its body of pre-existing legislation and case law to provide the fine details of that kind of edge case. In this case, we have extant law which means these kinds of edge cases are de facto exempt, provided they are made in good faith (i.e. they're not made by Nazis to glorify fascism).",

Hard fact is, there's more white supremacists than there is pagans, so the public only sees what they do. Most people entirely lack an educational foundation concerning those symbols. \n\nThe swastika is holy, a symbol of hope and fertility. It's among the most ancient symbols in history, and has belonged to almost everyone at one time or another! It dates back to the Indus River Valley civilizations and they populated both Asia and Europe with their great migratory treks. It links ALL people of every race together. That is has been used as a symbol of division and murder is obscene! \n\nImagine if someone used the Christian cross to mean \"Let's kill jews!\"...And now imagine if most of society just agreed that this is what the cross now means...that's what it's like to be a Germanic pagan right now, except Christianity has the raw numbers to fight that narrative while we subset of broader paganism don't. We have to be very secretive about our symbology because the general public doesn't understand it. Evil, dishonest people have polluted it with lies and hatred. A few of us carry the true meaning of these symbols into the future, hoping for the day when they can be restored to their rightful place, given back to ALL humanity. Only then will Hitler's reich truly be defeated. \n\nTo conquer an enemy, you must conquer their _language_, because words greatly outlive flesh. For so long as we allow white supremacists to \"own\" those symbols...that _language_...we give them all the power they need to hurt whoever they please...",

To disarm the nazis, they must be robbed of their symbology, and this is convenient since the lazy, feckless shits didn't actually create much of their own symbols.

Someone got the state attorney's office involved who then promptly said \"we're not even going to take this to court this is clearly legal\" and with that, the BPjM had new precedent.\n\nThe newer Wolfenstein games are still on shaky grounds, though, the issue is the magical/mystical, generally unreal setting, which could be construed to trivialise Nazi rule. Bethesda is still censoring it, but in any case now it's a case-by-case decision and not a blanket ban, which it actually never was publishers were simply too chicken to challenge it.\n\n[The law in question](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p0933).",

Anytime you see the flag now it's pretty much 40% hardcore alt-right, 40% hardcore radical left, 20% oldschool moderate left union member.

The committees raised after the uprising included many appeals by the miners against the Chinese being allowed to work the gold fields and to their \"takeover\" the usual \"Asian invasion\" bullshit we grew up with. The Miner's commissions established after the stockade would go on to enforce an anti Chinese tax.

I don't think you're wrong but I think that an undercurrent of nativism is quite common in union movements the world over. Remember that Jews were historically seen, by union founders, as capitalist pigs who were not to be trusted and were all assumed to be members of the bourgeoisie. That wasn't for any real reason: Jews have often been found, historically, living in desperate poverty, and the idea of Jews as money-obsessed and conniving is a very ancient racial slur that reflects centuries of being _expelled_ from every industry except finance. However, the turn of the century and mid-century union movements across the industrialised world almost universally did not welcome Jews because of these racist assumptions. \"They are outsiders. They're not one of us.\"\n\nThe same was done to non-white migrant workers the world over, who were seen as \"diluting worker power\" - a slogan rarely levelled at white, English-speaking immigrants. Muslims found themselves unable to work in many industries in British industrial plants; Hindus were told they weren't wanted. The Netherlands likes to think of itself as a bastion of liberty but Dutch union movements in history often looked very poorly on eastern European migrants.\n\nUnions are important, but have a history of racism all over the world that cannot be ignored.",

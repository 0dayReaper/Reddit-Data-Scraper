[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps.

If your going to look outside my original comment only for something you may think discredits me maybe you should ask why you felt the need to bother yourself when you make no clear point other then not liking what I said. It hardly confirms the wealth of your understanding or experience now does it?\n\n&gt;Damascus is the (political) capital of Syria, when referencing a country\u2019s government the political capital is usually what media will go by.\n\nYes in every circumstance clearly, as you ignore the article didn't do the same for Canada or the Netherlands. The articles use of language has detached the capital city from its entire country, not something very reasonable after Ukraine was invaded. Again you provided no insight into all the understanding you have.\n\n&gt;There are tons of articles that have a title starting with something like \u201cThe Hague says\u2026\u201d or \u201cThe Hague wants to\u2026\u201d.

I am implying the language is constructed in an unusual way, over simplified &amp; not egalitarian. Why does the piece allow the Netherlands &amp; Canada to remain as their state names while Syria is demoted to its capital. That's the entire point you fail to see.",

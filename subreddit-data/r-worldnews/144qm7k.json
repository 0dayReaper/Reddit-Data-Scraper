Our own government has admitted that your freedoms only exist as long as you don't actually try to use them.\n\nI'm not saying the US is worse than China. I am saying that our leadership and theirs are more similar than people like to admit. Sure, you can badmouth the POTUS and call him anything you want. In the US that's not a risk to the state. Actually protest and organize for real change? Murdered. Once you become a threat to existing power, our government just kills you. The feeling you have freedom is a carefully crafted lie.",

Even if they copy it and make they\u2019re own version - they\u2019re still making something they were asked to make.  It\u2019s the people driving new technology and original work that need input on standards that will work for up-and-coming technology.  On the other hand, China does some limited original work and they\u2019ll eventually need to give input on standards when they\u2019re getting ready to deploy new tech.  But the idea of the worlds biggest IP violator driving standards is chilling.  Also, driving standards to facilitate surveillance tech or stealing tech and then having a say in how it\u2019s used would validate both practices.",

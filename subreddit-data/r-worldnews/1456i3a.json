Could have been a failed 1st attempt, or could have just been a trial run over a less integral part of the dam to see how effective their explosives would be. Remember he himself said he doesn't have photos from all the days in-between, so there's a lot that could have happened in that time frame. He's taking minimal evidence and extrapolating a lot from it. Not to mention writing off other resources at the same time, like the seismic readings from Norway. \n\nAnd I find his theory about Russia being unable to operate the cranes for the spillway laughable. I don't think even the Russians were worried about Ukraine killing the crane operators. This is the same Ukraine that purposely avoided blowing up this bridge in the first place when it actually would have benefited them. And they have sought third parties to take control of the nuclear power plants in their country to ensure they ran safely and avoided a nuclear disaster. But now they are going to kill dam engineers, likely their fellow Ukrainians and jeopardize the dams' integrity? Nah, that's a Russian thing to do. \n\nPlus the bridge broke apart in 2 distinct areas, one of which could be supported by his hypothesis, but the other is like 100 meters away and doesn't lineup with his reasoning",

The dam, and the road across it, offered a possible line of attack for Ukrainian forces looking for ways to keep Russian forces off-balance.\n\n&gt;It seems highly likely that Russian forces, which controlled the dam, decided to blow it up, taking one of Kyiv's military operations off the table.\n\n&gt;**Kyiv had already signalled its interest in this stretch of the front line more than once.**\n\n&gt;In late April, Ukrainian soldiers crossed the river and briefly established a bridgehead at Oleshky. Ukraine also took control of several small islands in the Dnipro delta, close to Kherson.\n\n&gt;The extent of Kyiv's military plans for this area is not known, and is now academic. The catastrophic flooding will have made river crossings impossible for the time being.\n\n&gt;\"But the fact that such a direction was an option was seen by the Russians,\" Mr Kuzan said. \n\nI'm much more inclined to believe this summary of events surrounding the dam.\n\n[HERE](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-65860294) is the full article. Worth reading because of the credibility of the sources used and not some guy making speculative Youtube videos from his home.",

Erosion from the water forcing its way through a hole it was never designed to flow through means that the hole will quickly widen, and in fact will widen more and more quickly as it grows, until the dam collapses.",

But if they blew up the gate on one of the sluice gates that would let the water flow out through a hole that was designed for that to happen. Yes, they could have simply opened the gate, but if the Ukrainians had captured the dam they could have subsequently closed it again.\n\nI'm just speculating, of course.

Better than letting it fail, while under their control, at a time that might be strategically harmful to them. Or potentially letting control fall completely back into Ukrainian hands where they would see the damage and call for international aid that becomes difficult for Russia to oppose, since it could prevent *this* (rather than the breach having already happened, where it becomes easier for Russia to treat this like spilled milk) - international aid effectively makes this a demilitarized zone, which is a defacto loss of territory for Russia.",

(2) who would benefit of a dam breach? (3) what other methods could the ukrainians use if they wanted to blow the dam and why? \n\neverything points to the russians. in order to blow the dam you would need at least 3000 kg of explosives, nothing a single torpedo can do. or you need to put divers in the water but you need a bunch of them to carry that much explosives. So who would  have full access to the dam to place the explosives? also Ukraine would need the dam to cross over to the east. They were better off to place defensive artillery to take out any russians trying to invade deeper into the western side. Ukrainians are not that insane to destroy so much of their own country and farm lands that they need to rebuild their economy. This stinks fully of russian tactics: they dont give a shit about the russian speaking ukranians on their occupied areas. they havent done anything to assist the people there but only shoot at the ukranians trying to save people. Sadly those that are stuck on the russian side are helpless and hopefully they can see that continue support of the russians is stupid. Im not talking about ALL the people stuck on that side, just the dumbfuks that started this shit in 2014 (DPR &amp; LPR) and they finally wake up and realize russia was never there to help them at all. \n\nand before anyone says it, ya the DPR &amp; LPR are just FSB shitheads that started this crap back then.",

The hundreds of pounds of explosives needed to blow the dam would need to be on the inside. On the outside it would require hundreds, if not thousands of more pounds to have the same effect. Additionally a drone boat explosive wouldn\u2019t of been directional and would be even more inefficient, unlike some missiles which can direct there blast towards the front allowing more of the explosive to be directed toward the target. \n\nWith all that, a multi thousand pound floating explosive going down the Dnieper river passing by Kherson seems like a very interesting strategy.\n\nEdit: going *up* the Dnieper river",

It is so much harder to blow up a dam from the face that it really only makes sense on something small that is thin enough to defeat with arty.\n\nThe most effective way to destroy that dam is setting charges running front to back in columns near the center and set at half to 2/3 the depth of the dam. You are looking to break the face of the dam and break up everything behind it so water can do all the hard work.\n\nThe dam was blown exactly how you would do it if you were using planted charges to break the dam.",

The flooding primarily effects the Russian controlled side. Either way Ukraine would have had to cross the river if they wanted to dislodge the Russians and reclaim that territory, whereas Russians are already spread too thin and simply need to defend it.\n\nIt\u2019s also a huge distraction for the Russian army which now has to deal with this on top of very difficult front lines elsewhere with no rivers for Ukrainians to cross. \n\nKherson is a region that was captured without a single bullet being fired, so the locals aren\u2019t exactly patriotic Ukrainians. At best they hate Russia for bringing war there, rather than any kind of love for the Ukrainian government. \n\nI don\u2019t know exactly what happened with this dam but the notion that it\u2019s obvious Russia blew up the dam is laughable to me. It seems to benefit Ukraine a lot more specifically from a strategic standpoint.",

NORSAR said in a statement that signals captured from a station 385 miles away from the dam show clear indications of an explosion.",

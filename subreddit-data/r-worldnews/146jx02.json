            "comment": "I haven't seen this mentioned yet, but Russia claims there has been another sea-drone attack on one of their ships. \n\nThis info may explain why the Global Hawks (like Forte 10) have been flying a different pattern over the Black Sea lately - they are watching for any signs of a pipeline breach.\n\nThere are some interesting comments in the Twitter thread, for anyone who'd like to read it, too.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CovertShores/status/1667905404976742402\n\nhttp://www.hisutton.com/Implied-Threat-To-TurkStream-Gas-Pipeline.html\n\n&gt;Spy Ship Attacked: Russia Implies Ukrainian/NATO Threat To TurkStream Gas Pipeline\n\n\n&gt;There are reports from Russian sources claiming that the Black Sea Fleet Vishnya class Intelligence Ship Priazovye, was attacked by maritime drones (USVs). This happened in the Southeast Black Sea, in a similar area to where Russian intelligence ship Ivan Khurs attacked on May 24.\n\n&gt;From a defense analysis the attack is interesting, although all USVs (reportedly 6) are said to have been destroyed. However the claimed reason that she was there may be more significant.\n\n&gt;It is generally expected that Russian intelligence ships operating in this area, away from Ukrainian controlled coasts, are there to monitor NATO air assets. However the Russian reports claim a different purpose. She was apparently \"defending of Turk stream gas pipeline\" (and/or Blue Stream) 300km southeast of Sevastopol. Vishnya class intelligence ships are not well suited to protecting undersea infrastructure.\n\n&gt;The TurkStream pipeline is controversial because, like Nord Stream, it is seen as a way Russia can pipe gas to Europe without going via Ukraine. It also offers Turkey the potential to 'whitewash' Russian gas to obscure its origin. It is operated by Gazprom (Russian onshore section, offshore section) and BOTA\u015e (Turkish onshore section)\n\n&gt;The inference is that Russia believes that it needs to defend the pipeline. Possibly from Ukrainian or NATO sabotage. This seems far-fetched.\n\n&gt;This may indicate Russia trying to frame Ukraine for an as-yet unrealized attack on the pipeline.",

It's like a much faster Tomahawk. The glamorous, news worthy arms race \"hypersonics\" are cruise missiles on steroids, they are essentially warhead armed drone vehicles capable of loitering and super high speed maneuvering in flight to avoid detection or interception. The Kinzhal is incapable of that so you could make the argument that it isn't the same thing as the weapons that the US, China, Russia, etc are trying to develop.\n\nIt was kind of a PR thing for Russia to come out and say they had developed the Kinzhal - They made a big deal about it and beating the US to developing to serial production a hypersonic weapon. But it won't really be anything like the weapons systems we will call hypersonics in 10 or 20 years.",

Kherson/Kharkiv Offensives ended because of rivers getting in the way, for Russians the river was a godsend.  They were able to escape across them relatively quickly (but suffered huge losses doing so).\n\nFor THIS offensive, they dont have that option.  They will have to either retreat west towards Melitopol where they will immediately be cut off from the rest of the Russian forces, sea routes being the only supply line or...\n\nEast, towards Makivka/Donetsk where there are already huge concentrations of Russian troops - with Ukrainians on their tail.  Over population of troops will become an enormous issue for the Russians in these areas as Ukraine will have far superior firing positions with easy pickins.  \n\n\nI dont think they will retreat towards Mariupol to stage a defense, its just not a great position  \n\nI think they will go east - and probably try to abandon the entire area west of Donetsk.  Many will be left behind and trapped in the west around Melitopol by Ukranian Forces - resulting in the first mass capture of troops of the war.  \n\n\nI dont believe the Russians have the capability to facilitate the mass evacuation of troops by sea at the moment either so - shucks for them.   \n\n\nI dont think this will be a hypersonic offensive either, its gonna take time.    \n\n\nMind you, I have absolutely no idea what im talking about!",

It acted to end the siege on ~~Mariupol~~ Mykolaiv and place the river between armies during the winter, while freeing hundreds of thousands of people at relatively (but not actually) low cost.  In hindsight that might have lead to the inevitability of a terrorist strike on the dam.\n\nBut driving east through Donetsk has a huge flanking potential.  It could potentially cut around to the sea east of Mariupol, or provide HIMARS fire control all the way to the sea and make holding those areas very difficult.\n\nGetting back to the sea of Azov is very valuable strategically since it divides russia's forces in two.  It also potentially grants sea access to the Crimean bridge that would make an entire section of land if sufficiently damaged.",

Attacking through fortified areas has  a much worse kill ratio (in both equipment and people) than defending through those same areas.  But you can make all that back if you get a route somehow.  The Kharkiv offensive is a great example of this - tons of armor was left behind, and thousands of russians killed or captured, even during a fairly ordered hasty retreat by ru forces from Izium.\n\nTaking territory has advantages, sometimes strategic (providing avenues for further attack or cutting off other areas), economic (the Kharkiv offensive lifted the siege of Kharkiv and allowed some to return to the city), or humanitarian (many torture chambers were shut down).  But the actual amount of territory that's been exchanged since ~October is very small.\n\nInterestingly it sounds like Ukraine might be achieving a good kill ratio even on the offense here.  They never release numbers on people, but we've seen many dead russians while russian telegram has not shown many dead Ukrainians.  Equipment trades are less meaningful since the combined economies supporting Ukraine's are so much larger than russia's - but just trading 1-1 in monetary value of the equipment involved should be a win, and it seems like the ratio is more like 5:1 on the tanks (though it's hard to compare the value of older Leopard 2s versus much-much-older T62s being pulled out of stockpiles, nominally the Leopard is 2x the cost though).",

It's dangerous even to put boats through it.  Mines have washed up on each shore at random, flotsam and rubble are everywhere, the riverbed will blow out any tire that touches it, this is all under ongoing artillery fire.  It's not going to be crossed.  \n\nThe only good news is it probably was never going to be crossed anyway, but however hard it was with the dam intact (and it's one of the hardest things an army can do), it's impossibly hard now.",

We know Ukraine was preparing for it. These troops are probably trained for crossing operations and establishing bridgeheads. Even though the plan may have changed, they probably have a bunch of specialized equipment. Transferring them to Zaporizhzhia isn't necessarily the best use of them, although there seem to be a good amount of rivers to cross there.",

Unbelievably biased, inaccurate, way too much editorializing, pushing obviously bs conspiracy theories (he was one of the first guys I remember saying that the Ukranian air defence missile that went into Poland was really a Russian missile that went there because they switched the latitude and longitude. I'm as dumb as they come, and even I me pretty sure that's not how missiles work.)\n\nRFU can be bias, and the clickbait thumbnails are annoying, but at least their content has a little accuracy and integrity instead of being straight propaganda.",

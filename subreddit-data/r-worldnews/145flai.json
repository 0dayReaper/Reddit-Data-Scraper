They're the main allied powers that won the second world war, 2. There were negotiations between the USSR and the rest because of potential United States dominance, and 3. All 5 nations still had their own interests in foreign policy.\n\nBut nowadays its seens as undemocratic and a huge mistake. Because now Russia (or any of the 5, but its rarer for the other 4 to do it) can be a menace and veto anything that condemns them, or anything that furthers any kind of progression around the world (human rights, climate change, or condemnations over war).",

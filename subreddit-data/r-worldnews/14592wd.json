            "comment": "Yes, it's definitely a serious problem. Dengue fever is spread by mosquitoes, and with the increased rainfall and high humidity caused by El Nino conditions, mosquito breeding and survival rates can skyrocket. It's crucial for people in affected areas to take precautions against mosquito bites and for governments to ramp up efforts to control the mosquito population. Stay safe and keep an eye out for any symptoms of dengue fever.",

            "comment": "I remember traveling through Central America in early 2016 and getting super sick after about a month of traveling. I thought it was Dengue. Everything hurt, I had terrible headaches, vomitting - I couldn't keep anything down - and a fever. Then the rash showed up - covered me from my neck to my ass, and the blood shot eyes (conjunctivitis). \n\nI was never more relieved to have Zika in all my life. I quarantined myself in a small hotel in Honduras for about a week before continuing on to scuba dive on Utila Island, perfectly fine. \n\nDengue is no joke. I've seen it cut fellow hostel-hoppers' trips dead.",

Or at least for me to notice it. I was preparing to buy a flight home by then. I noticed the rash and conjunctivitis at the same time and heaved a sigh of relief, though I was still miserable for a couple of days after. After about a week, I was feeling almost normal, if tired, and still a bit off my appetite.",

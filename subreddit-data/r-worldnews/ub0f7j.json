People need to remember that Macron himself is an insurgent party. He's not an establishment figure. En Marche came together as something of a reflex and a reaction\n\nThe two historic totems of French politics still haven't re-established themselves. If neither can do next time, where is France going to turn to next?\n\nThe timing of the Ukraine war helped Macron here otherwise this could have been a whole lot closer\n\nFrance has always had the most receptive electorate to extreme right wing politics in western Europe for the past 20-25 years though.

[Foundations of geopolitics.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics)\n\nHere's a few bits:\n\n&gt;In Foundations of Geopolitics, Dugin calls for the United States and Atlanticism to lose their influence in Eurasia, and for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances.[3]\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;Military operations play relatively little role. The textbook advocates a sophisticated program of subversion, destabilization, and disinformation spearheaded by the Russian special services.[12]...\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;The United Kingdom, merely described as an \"extraterritorial floating base of the U.S.\", should be cut off from Europe.[9]\n\n&gt;Belarus and Moldova are to become part of Russia.[9]\n\n&gt;Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because \"Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics\". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.[9]\n\n&gt;In the United States:  Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke \"Afro-American racists\". Russia should \"introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements \u2013 extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics\".[9]",

I looked at Facebook for the first time in years recently on a blank account that I only use for local buy/sell/restaurant groups with no friends. The default facebook experience is jarring. It's just an extreme right wing brainwashing machine. 100% of the posts are from clear propaganda farm accounts like \"Barbara Johnson in Wisconsin\" that have no friends and exclusively post trump/anti-covid memes.  \n\nThe replies are 75% those accounts, with 25% legitimate people who think they're interacting with other real people and are falling into the brainwashing propaganda whirlpool. These people think the world is being taken over by the left who are going to implement martial satanic law, and the only thing that will save them is pro-Putin ultra right wing candidates (Trump, LePen).\n\nIt's actually pretty terrifying.",

                    "comment": "&gt; But when it became Macron vs. Le Pen, voters hated the idea of Le Pen.\n\nMacron was favorite to win against every single one of the 11 contenders, not just Le Pen.\n\nThat's the point. Many absolutely hate his guts because of his policies, but there isn't a majority of the voters who think the other candidates are more competent. Which is why he was favorite to win since the beginning. He also happens to have such a strong undying fanbase in France, especially among our elders (60 years old and above). You would expect them to vote for a more socially \"conservative\" politician or far right like old voters often do in many other western countries out of nostalgia but they don't.\n\nHe is such a weird case in French politics. To many of his supporters, he is literally the messiah, the greatest president we've seen in decades lmao. But at the same time, I have never seen a president as passionately hated as he is. Even his two predecessors (Sarkozy and Hollande) weren't as hated despite having lower approval ratings than Macron does. He is a bit of an anomaly.\n\nRegardless of what you think of him personally or liberal right-wing politics, you gotta give credit to the guy. Macron has now become the first French president since de Gaulle to be reelected outside of a \"cohabitation\" (so reelected while having a majority at the assembly) and in 2017, he already was the youngest French president to ever be elected. Dude just keeps making history. He is either a lucky bastard or a much more brilliant politician than his political opponents portray him as. No way, I would've expected a dude who was in charge of France through the Yellow Vests and the pandemic in such a politically divided French society to somehow be reelected. But hey... the competition sucking donkey balls in this era helps. Forget \"far-right\" shenanigans or the Russia links... a candidate with Le Pen's economic program (which is straight up demagoguery) shouldn't be making it to the 2nd round really and yet here we are. She made it to the 2nd round twice in a row.",

He is just bizarre.\n\nI think this may be a by-product of this social media era we live in. As some quick examples; I'm from Canada. Trudeau was seen as a huge win for young Canadians when he was elected. I voted for him in 2016. But he is viewed today as the greatest leader we've had by some, \"good enough\" by most, and a literal tyrant by others. \n\nTrudeau is not a tyrant. Some of his policies, such as gun laws and internet censorship, are questionable, but he isn't a tyrant. Its just that we have subsidized echo-chambers for those opinions to fester now. \n\nTake Biden as another example. He's no shining beacon of light. He also isn't single-handedly steering America towards collapse.\n\nNothing about todays global political climate is \"normal\" by standards we used even 10 years ago. Anyone who is a current leader will be either loved or hated, and both opinions will be loud. But most people fall in between, and don't shout their opinions. \n\nThats just my take",

Now the left has been stuck with very unpragmatic candidates and center right's platform is just too encroached upon to compete.  \n\nSome people hate him just because they are stuck with this choice as the normal other choices have been subsumed by his platform, and the other problem is he doesn't conceal well his belief that he is usually right... ie he comes across as very arrogant/elite in a country that hates the elite. A lot of French politicians usually make some show of \"understanding\" where the protests and opposition are coming from. Macron goes on TV for hours to debate with yellow vests for example and what you get is an elite young man schooling a construction worker or farmer about why their beliefs are wrong or what they are saying isn't possible. He is in fact often right but if you already dislike the guy, seeing him lecture an elderly poor person in front of the whole country will make you hate him.",

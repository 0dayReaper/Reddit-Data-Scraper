Chance\u2019s are nothing will ever happen but you never know. If the bus tips all the windows will blow out and those closest to the widows will be piled on by all the other passengers driving them into the ground or pavement turning them into hamburger. In this accident, more like lunch meat. Just so you know I lost a coworker who fell out a window when his commuter train derailed and tipped over. If there is a seatbelt, put it on.",

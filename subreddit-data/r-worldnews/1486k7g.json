[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That stuff happens routinely here. \n\nIndia routinely bans shit tons of app with just one excuse 'terrorism'. Even though the real reason is control and cowardice because they're afraid of people getting control and power. Same for its 'porn-ban'. \n\nIndia ranks highest to force private information out of facebook, google and twitter. All this does jack-shit as India still has a lot of Cyberbullying and Tech-Scammers.\n\nEdit: Apparently people are mad I called protest a protest. Farmer protest was a protest, so was hong kong protest. Major violence happened in both. I wouldn't call it a 'riot' or anything else that would be disservice to Manipuri people.. It is just a protest gone bad because that's how it started, like most protests do. More over the point is the govt banned internet on Day 1, It's over 30 days ago when the violence wasn't even that much bad then.",

It is also worth noting that the land-based MiG-29 impressed the IAF, and was used to augment the primary jet aircrafts of Mirage-2000 and Jaguars well. \n\nUkraine intercepting Iskanders and Kalibrs only increases confidence on the S-300. \n\nRegarding the T-90, we were already working on a local NATO-style heavy tank which did not give the expected results and we did not have any other options because we don't buy Chinese tanks and Pakistan purchased T-80s from Ukraine.",

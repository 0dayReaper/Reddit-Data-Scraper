The president of the United States posts an extremely low-quality stock image of the American flag to Twitter after killing an Iranian military leader in an air strike  \n2. Iran retaliates by firing missiles on an American base.  An Iranian government official posts an image of their *Iranian* flag to Twitter, a website wholly owned by **a company from the country they just attacked**, mocking the American president.  \n3. The top reply to the tweet is a meme posted by some random Twitter user mocking Iran\n\nIt's so hard to believe that this is real...\n\nI'm saving this to show my grandkids what a fking absurd time it was that I lived through:\n\n[https://ameo.link/u/700.png](https://ameo.link/u/700.png)",

With that being said, if this is true, they are probally Iraqi soldiers.....when American Soldiers are killed in combat there are strict procedures required before releasing it to the public (due to next of kin notifications).....If American Soldiers were killed, we won't know until the Pentagon releases a statement",

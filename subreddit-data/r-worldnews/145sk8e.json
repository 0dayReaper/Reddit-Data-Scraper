With their new delivery systems failing to make a good impression, I quite firmly believe this could only be overwhelmed by quantity.\n\nWhich means Russia will still need to rely on numbers and keep their nuclear missile forces in the several hundreds. That's damn expensive, and they were actually trying to go smaller (with more quality).\n\nIf those systems get purchased by more European countries, Russia's nuclear strategy planners are going to get some serious headaches.\n\nIn that regard, Europe's dense population is helpful. You could conceivably cover it with strategic missile defenses.",

It would have no meaningful purpose in a point/terminal stage defense against an ICBM. \n\nThe window between an ICBM during midcourse flight and it's descent back into the atmosphere where an Arrow 3 could even attempt an interception is so small, it realistically doesn't exist, particularly for a silo-based system that can't be easily moved around based off threats and intelligence.",

Small van would suffice, let alone 18 wheelers.  \n* Freight train.  A single boxcar.  \n* Cargo on an aircraft, fuse trigger by altitude.  \n* Recreational boat, say 30 foot.  \n* Large sail boat.  \n* Yacht.  (Double points if indicted oligarch on-board. :-) \n    \nAny of these can bring in the nukes.  Then perhaps pre-position them by temporary storage in offices, warehouses, homes.  \n   \nThese alternate methods even have major technical advantages:  The weapon does not have to physically fit within a cramped missile warhead space, nor be engineered to withstand an initial 100 Gs acceleration on launch.   \n   \nMilitary bases make it harder to get close to them, but remember nukes can destroy large areas, so even a close detonation can be deadly.  \n    \nDo not misinterpret as my saying Arrow-3, Patriot, etc are useless.   /EVERY/ NATO country should have  anti-missile defences (plural). They are important, as part of a compete system.  \n   \nThe bottom line is don't become so complacent about missiles that defenses are let up in other areas.  Keep pushing nuclear non-proliferation, as long as possible.  Your children will thank you.",

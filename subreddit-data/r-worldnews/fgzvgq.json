I seem to get downvoted for this every time I mention it because people think I am downplaying COVID-19 when I mention flu deaths, but last year the flu in the US killed on average 650 people _a week_.

China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan all got hit by SARS pretty hard, and were not fucking around this time. \n\nConversely Japan didn't really deal with SARS, so they've been dicking around for the past month. They've got community spread and people are pissed at the government's inaction (followed by very random actions like requesting all schools to be closed without any plan for what to do with the kids or how to support parents that need to stay home because of it, etc.). Testing has been limited. They totally botched the cruise ship situation by keeping them on the boat (and allowing them to infect each other more) - only to have to deal with them anyway (and many more than it would have been had they just dealt with it immediately). Our neighbor, Korea, is being treated like some sort of biohazard, but the truth is they're way more on top of their shit than Japan is - at least they have a better idea of how many people have it. I worry for Japan and our elderly population.",

I\u2019m 99% sure I\u2019m fine but it\u2019s still frustrating.

Your response is also the exact reason the WHO have been reluctant to characterise the outbreak as a pandemic prior to this. \n\nThe WHO have stressed that while this is the first coronavirus to be characterised as a pandemic, it is also the first pandemic they've seen that CAN be contained. \n\nMost countries where the epidemic is still relatively small should still focus on containment and fight aggressively to slow the spread of the virus. They should also focus their efforts on preparing their health systems should the spread become extensive within their communities. \n\nWhile the WHO have admitted that some countries should take a more aggressive approach in the containment phase than they currently are,  characterising this outbreak as a pandemic is not an excuse for any country to give up all together and simply surrender their populations to the mercy of the virus. \n\nThere will undoubtedly be many dark days ahead but now is not the time to give up, we must not forget that hope is the only thing stronger than fear.",

I've been buying a little extra of the things I may need if I'm not working for several weeks and if people decide to raid us.   Our supply chain isn't designed to accommodate a significant increase in demand for products, its designed for minimal fluctuations and cost to the company.   We are going to be out of a lot of shit if there's a panic.   We don't have the bodies to run things if one person calls out as is, so of business increases, and people call out, don't expect to be able to get what you need.   It's much better to just buy it now when we can adjust to smaller incremental increases in sales.   For example our produce dept has been up in sales around 20-25% for the last few weeks and is always in great shape, but our GM dept that sells cleaners and sanitizer etc has been up 80-100% in sales and cannot keep products on the shelf.   I'd rather load up on stuff I'll use over the long term even if I don't need it than to be up shit creek later.   Having extra will allow me to give it to my older parents who shouldn't be out and about and who aren't taking this seriously as well.  Yesterday I just loaded up on cat litter and cat food.   Just use your heads and do a little planning ahead.",

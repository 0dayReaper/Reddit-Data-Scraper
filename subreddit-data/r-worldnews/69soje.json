You've got a 24hr news network to keep flowing and facts are rattled off pretty fast. The only thing you have left to fill the airwaves is speculation and discourse. At that point is where you can play with narratives. Sadly, you end up leaning one direction because watching a neutral discourse isn't appealing. It also turned out that people *like* having their beliefs reinforced so you cater to that and now you have a biased news outlet.",

Shitloads of scientific studies show that if you \"prime\" people with certain viewpoint, they will be far more likely to accept it as fact if presented with new evidence, even if questionable.\n\nFor example, if you tell people for months that broccoli causes cancer, some will accept it, most won't. But if after that, if you show another questionable study saying that broccoli causes heart failure, shitloads of them will buy it.\n\nThe right has been attacking Clinton for more than a decade (how many Benghazi hearings again?) Hell, even the left-leaning places (like /r/politics) were posting for months about what a fraud she is. So when the leaks came, people were already primed for it, so many accepted it.\n\nWhereas in France there were very little attacks against Macron, because quite frankly nobody thought he'd do that well. So when the leaks came out, people weren't primed and they didn't just accept it. If the far-right spent years spreading conspiracy theories about him, the leaks would have worked like a charm.",

A lot of those people feel like the world is moving too fast, leaving them unheard, and that the wealthy and the elites are reaping the benefits of globalization while they see limited improvements in their own lives and threats to their employment, financial security, culture, etc.\n\nIt is not crazy to feel like those in power and those making big money in big urban centers (Paris) have lost touch with what people living in smaller towns and urban areas think.\n\nThose are not illegitimate concerns. They have to be heard and the problems have to be addressed in a careful, sane way.",

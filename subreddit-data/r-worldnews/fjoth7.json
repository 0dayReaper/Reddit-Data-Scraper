And the median incubation period is estimated at 5.1 days.\nThe top commenter is not wrong that this requires seroconversion. This test does have a window of about 7-10 days from first infection before it can detect the presence of antibodies. And because you should only use this test when you have had suspected symptoms for at least 3 days, it does go against guidance in many countries to self-isolate and to not go to a hospital. This test can however detect the long-term IgG antibodies which will show if you have been infected with COVID-19 in the past.\n\nSources:\nLauer, S. et al., 2020.

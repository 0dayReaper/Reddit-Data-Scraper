            "comment": "&gt;The fish fauna of the Xingu river is extremely rich with an estimated 600 fish species and with a high degree of endemism. The area either dried out or drowned by the dam spans the entire known world distribution of a number of species, e.g. the zebra pleco (Hypancistrus zebra), the sunshine pleco (Scobinancistrus aureatus), the slender dwarf pike cichlid (Teleocichla centisquama), the killifish Anablepsoides xinguensis and Spectrolebias reticulatus, and the Xingu dart-poison frog (Allobates crombiei). An independent expert review of the costs of the dam concluded that the proposed flow through the Volta Grande meant the river \"will not be capable of maintaining species diversity\", risking \"extinction of hundreds of species\".\n\n---\n&gt;Dams in Brazil emit high amounts of methane, due to the lush jungle covered by waters each year as the basin fills. Carbon is trapped by foliage, which then decays anaerobically with help from methanogens, converting the carbon to methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. As a result, carbon emissions are emitted from the dam each year it is in operation. A 1990 study of the Curu\u00e1-Una Dam, also in Brazil, found that it pollutes 3.5 times more in carbon dioxide equivalent than an oil power plant generating an equal amount of electricity would; not in the form of the CO2 atmospheric pollution associated with fossil fuel burning, but as the more dangerous methane emissions. Furthermore, the forest will be cleared before flooding of the area, so the CO2 and methane emissions calculated for the flooding of the forested area will be significantly undercut. In addition, a study on the Brazilian Tucuru\u00ed dam showed that the actual greenhouse gas emissions were a factor ten higher than its official calculations showed, and this dam is no exception; it is feared that the Belo Monte Dam calculations are also deliberately undercutting reality and that the flooding of its reservoir will create a similar situation. If the dam builders cleared the forest beforehand, they would remove the organic matter from the reservoir floor and the dam would produce less of the greenhouse gas methane. However, in the case of Tucuru\u00ed, only the economically necessary forest was cut (10%, near the opening to the spillway) and the rest was left intact to be flooded by the reservoir. The contractors had sold the logging rights to the flooded area, but found the plot unviable in the short amount of time they had allocated before the area was set to be flooded. This forest has been decaying under the water through Methanogenesis and producing large amounts of greenhouse gases.",

                    "comment": "So part of this, the Aquarium hobby called years ago. There was a massive push to get Zebra Plecos breeding in captivity. I think the same happened with the Sunshine Pleco.\n\nIt is incredibly important that these fish are not subject to CITES Appendix I (they are currently Appendix II), as in many countries, including the US, it is illegal to own Appendix I species. Since basically all conservation for these fish happens in captivity, and relies on expert fish keepers to keep them alive and breeding, making them illegal to own would severely hamper conservation efforts.",

You are spot on. \n\nThe pet trade is why I have stayed away from salt water tanks. Too many of the fish come from the wild. I have gone out of my way to make sure I only get captive breed freshwater fish from reputable breeders. \n\nI am fortunate that I have 2 amazing LFS in my part of California.",

Then drift over to some chollo that was like candy to him. Usually would sit munching his harder woods.\n\nThe true zebras that went for 10k+ back in the early 00s can be had for a few hundred bucks these days thanks to the aquaria hobbyists going hard on helping keep them from becoming extinct. \n\nI always wanted to go on one of those Amazon fish hunts that Ken would sponsor but timing just never lined up.

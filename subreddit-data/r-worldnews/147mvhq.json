Same goes for people with other chronic medical conditions or diseases.\n\nI don't think being gay should ever be classified as a mental disorder. I just hate this stupid joke, because it's not really the gotcha that people seem to think it is.\n\nIn fact, in a homophobic country where homosexuality is classified as mental disorder, you would not get to \"call in sick\", you would probably just be fired for it. And then have the authorities deal with you. So good luck with that.",

The current government only got formed by having Anwar's party ally themselves with BN which is infamous for having Najib leading years ago after a hung parliament. So it's a shaky alliance from my understanding and even then, they only barely got the majority seats after this alliance. The opposition has been using Tiktok effectively to spread the narrative that Anwar is a liberal that will try to take away Islamic rights and all.\n\nBasically what I'm trying to say is, the conservative bloc makes up a big slice of pie of the current demographic of Malaysia so it honestly makes sense for him to appeal to them otherwise it is very likely the opposition will win and takeover. Not to mention the opposition has been stoking up race and religion rhetoric and threaten to oust the current government.\n\nMaking these jokes would just give fuel to the opposition and help sell the narrative that he is against Muslims. As much as I dislike Anwar he really is the least worst option in this political climate. But I could be totally wrong, I had to Google who is Abbie Hoffman because I never heard of him so you can probably tell my age from this lol",

While PH are considered more progressive than our previous government, that's only relative to the extremely corrupt nationalist government we had before, and it's extremely unlikely that the government is going to be able to actually give better legal rights to women, ethnic minorities and LGBTQ+ individuals in the near future.  \n  \nNone of the old Islamic politicians currently leading our country are likely to change or shake things up in the near future. It's tough being an LGBTQ+ individual in this country because you can see how resistant the culture and government are to change because they believe strongly in \"Islamic family values\" and fail to realise that this bigotry is part of why the rest of the world is leaving them behind.",

LGB people are just embracing their reality, they're men attracted to other men, or women attracted to other women, or either attracted to both.  T people are a totally separate group and it's not even close to being the same or a similar thing.  I really don't know how they managed to get bundled together with LGB.  It's kinda the opposite in a way - LGB people accept and embrace their reality, T people are in denial of what they are and to me this is a mental disorder.  You don't oblige someone who thinks that they're the Human Torch and asks you for a can of petrol and a match so that they can prove to you that they're immune to fire - you get them mental help, you don't help them self-immolate!  If someone think they're Napoleon we don't prescribe them a horse and a French Field Marshall's uniform, we try to bring them back to facing reality and embracing who they actually are.",

You can't deny your physical biology, you just have to accept what you are.  If you're a man who gravitates towards a career/activities or other passions that have been typically stereotyped by society as 'female pursuits,' you don't need to get your willy chopped off and bags of salinated water implanted in your chest to pursue those things - just do them, stereotypes be damned, you really don't need to mutilate your body before you get a pass that allows you to do those things!",

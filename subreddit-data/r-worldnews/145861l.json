I assume you're talking about intersex people, all of whom  conform to the human sex binary  (they either produce large gametes or small gametes).\n\nThe Swiss person suing to be classified as nonbinary is of the female sex. Pretending otherwise don't make it true.\n\nNow you can certainly make the case that someone should be classified as M or F on their passport based on their physical presentation, but nonbinary isn't a physical presentation.",

In December, the government\u00a0rejected changing the binary gender system\u00a0on official records but the political debate continues.\n\nThe procedure for changing gender between male and female in Switzerland has been\u00a0simplified since the start of 2022\u00a0but only binary options remain on official records.\n\n\u201cThe current legal system is anything but satisfactory,\u201d said one judge. \u201cThe legislature should not simply continue with the same agenda.\u201d\n\nJulian will now appeal the Supreme Court verdict to the European Court of Human Rights.",

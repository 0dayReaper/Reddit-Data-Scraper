The collective hive mind is so conspiracy oriented that as soon as conservatives started to incorporate some of the conspiracy talk into their politics, so many of my SDA friends bought everything wholesale.\n\nThe same people that would always go \"we are people of the book, we must study and search for truth\" are now the ones going \"hey, this company that totally isn't a pyramid scheme has the cure for Covid and it's all-natural. Also, those Demoncrats are totally drinking baby blood and Trump is trying to stop the deep-state.\"\n\nIt makes it extra ironic that so many of them voted for Trump, despite their *entire religion* being about how an anti-Christ will come, convince Christians to persecute other Christians, and bring about the end of the world. Like, Trump literally went \"I don't need forgiveness\" and \"maybe I am the chosen one\" while also tear-gassing protestors so he can take a photo with a Bible at a church that he forced his way into as a publicity stunt and *still* think that Trump is somehow, not only a Christian, but *the* Christian president. Unlike that evil Muslim Obama.\n\nIt has become painfully obvious in the past 8 years that an overwhelming majority of Adventists (at least in the circles I used to be in) are Republicans first, conservatives second, Americans third, vegetarians fourth, Adventists fifth, Christians sixth, and somewhere way down on the list is \"caring for other people\" or \"actually doing even a lick of their own research or recognizing that Trump is more or less the *exact* type of Christian Mrs. White warned them would *literally bring about the end of the world*.\"\n\nAlso, tons of peddling pseudo-science because it's painfully obvious many of them just coasted on through Loma Linda University without even bothering to properly learn.\n\nI had a SDA doctor straight up pushing \"look at the numbers! When you exclude conditions related to lungs, most people don't die from it! It's all a liberal conspiracy!\" Like, fucking *what*? How the flying fuck are so many of you Adventists coming out of Loma Linda University and not understanding how charts are filled out for those that die in the hospital? I should not have to explain to a doctor how the fuck these charts are filled out or how statistics are gathered on those dying from a disease.\n\nThe right arm of Jesus is his healing ministry and the left arm is education, but the Adventists I'm running into nowadays are just running around as amputees screaming bullshit they found on Instagram or Facebook while giving undying devotion to, for lack of a better term, the personification of the Adventist anti-Christ.",

Isn't it a yes or no question?\n\nI ask this because in some other thread an American said something to the effect of \"I'm a Republican, but I voted Democrat last time,\" which in my country would mean you're a Democrat supporter now by virtue of voting.",

Do that with one or two little things and I think you'll find that they will naturally start seeing if there are more things they can agree on and you will shift from a state fruitlessness to one of productivity. \n\nI know it sounds like I'm feeding you cheap psychology, but this works.",

Putin is obviously wrong for invading Ukraine but do Liberals think that they can criminalize war? And if war is a crime are they going to try and arrest American troops. What will Americans do when our soldiers are being tried in the Democrat's Marxists courts? Who will defend the United States from China when all of our troops are in prison? And that is the Liberals' endgame is, they want to weaken the US military so that no one can oppose them tearing down the US Constitution. They will replace the Constitution with Critical Race Theory. No longer will you be allowed to question their agenda. They will make it illegal to love America or be proud of your heritage. This is what Liberals are trying to do, they want to make the military illegal to further their CRT agenda.\"",

The Leopard 2A5 up to 2A7 are the most modern (post 2000) versions of the Leopard 2, featuring the distinctive wedge shaped armor expansions on the front of the turret.\n\nThese later tanks have been produced in low numbers though, so there isn\u2019t much stock to send to Ukraine to begin with, despite some users having retired them.\n\nThe war in Ukraine presents a good case that (Western) European nations have atrophied their militaries too much in the post-Cold War era, not having enough military might to fight a full scale conventional war.\n\nWe don\u2019t just lack the current numbers, but don\u2019t have enough mothballed equipment stored to shore up to \u201890s sized fleets. Plus the production facilities need to be rebuilt. Especially in terms of tanks and heavy armor, Western Europe has lost a lot of its former industrial capabilities in the last 25 years.\n\nThe \u201870s era Leopard 1s were produced in a much higher numbers than the Leo 2s and are still easier to source, despite the increased difficulty off restoring these mothballed units to operational readiness.\n\nThe aren\u2019t well suited for heavy frontal assaults against heavily fortified positions, backed by Artillery and T-72s or more modern armour.\nIn tandem with Leo 2s they could do well however, and could hold their own against older T-55 ~ T-62 units, Russia has been forced to use.\n\nThey do lack the Leo 2 and Abrams\u2019 gun stabilization suites, but shooting on the move (at significant speed) is probably rare, even today. You still give up a bit of accuracy and trade it for reduced situational awareness.",

Maybe directly from the front, if they're lucky. Will the ukrainians send their Leo 1s in direct assaults against t72s? Who the fuck knows. I assume they know what they're doing. But I'd much rather be in an upgraded Leo1 than whatever the russians are fielding these days. Fact of the matter is that most of the time in tank battles, he who shoots first usually wins. And given Leo's decent suite of sensors, great maneuverability, and very accurate gun, the Leo will usually shoot first. And while it does significantly lack in the armor department, if used correctly you can partly make up for that.",

Older versions don't have thermals. The lack of a stabilised gun decreases survivability. Most ammo is stored in the front.",

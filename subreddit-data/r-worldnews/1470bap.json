Let's take a fragile species and relocate it to another continent where its \"cousins\" once lived and introduce it to an environment it knows nothing about. Also, it will always be an African Cheetah, the Asiatic cheetah was different from the African one.",

The article mentioned it, but why is the Indian prime minister Modi himself actively promoting this project? Poor cheetahs. Imagine being taken away from your home to die in a strange unknown environment. According to that article, the park is apparently not large enough and already filled with other predators and competing species too",

The man promoted the shit out of it, including transporting the cheetahs on a special plane with the front painted to look like one.\n\nThe Indian government has been trying to get cheetahs from Iran for at least a decade now - predating Modi. That wouldn't be so bad because the cheetahs in Iran would be the same species, unlike the Namibian cheetahs that we actually got. This was simply a way for Modi to say 'Look, I did something the opposition couldn't do!'.",

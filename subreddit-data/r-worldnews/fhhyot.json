He also could have not gotten rid of the pandemic response team in 2018, that way we would have a pandemic response team like just about every other first world nation.  When trump said \"nobody could have seen this coming\"... everyone with half a brain saw it coming, it's why they had a pandemic response team waiting. \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/politics/hhs-whistleblower-coronavirus/index.html\n\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/485037-whistleblower-claims-hhs-did-not-train-workers-caring-for-coronavirus\n\nhttps://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/02/28/whistleblower-accuses-trump-corrupt-effort-cover-possible-exposure-federal-workers\n\nJust some top links related to the whistle blower\n\nPoint is, I think they're in such denial and lack common sense whether it's due to ego or the belief that god will handle it that they're willing to forego pretty much all common sense precautions.  We have teleconferencing, they hypothetically could be in a room alone with almost zero risk, but instead trump has gone to multiple events where people have been confirmed to have covid-19, and they're putting all of their eggs in one basket by having trump and pence next to each other regularly for seemingly no reasons other than stupidity and an attempt to make people calm so as not to hurt the stock market anymore. \n\nLet's hope pelosi has been taking her vitamins and RBG is in a protective bubble.",

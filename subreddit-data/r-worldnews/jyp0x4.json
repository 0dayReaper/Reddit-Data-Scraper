Children cannot give meaningful consent.",

The age of consent in Japan is 13 everywhere.\n\nHowever, what prefectures in Japan have done is add additional penalties for other sex crimes for when the victim is under 17 or 18 (exact age depends on region).\n\nFor example, if someone coerces, by threat or action, someone into having sex, it is a crime regardless of age. But if the victim is also under 17 or 18, then the prefecture can add additional charges.\n\nThe other example is enticement, offering money for sex, which can be illegal at any age depending on details. If the person is under the prefectural consent age, then that is an additional crime.\n\nHowever, no matter where you are in Japan, if two people have sex, and both are over the age of 13, and there is no evidence of coercion, payment, or anything else that casts consent in doubt, then it's perfectly legal.\n\n Age difference does not play a part.\n\nAlso, the standards for what are considered coercion or enticement might be more strict in the case of someone under 17 or 18. For example, you can buy a 19 year old dinner and then later have sex and that is nothing unusual. But if you buy a 16 year old dinner and then have sex, that could be viewed as enticement.\n\nHowever, note that the standards of proof for any kind of sex crime are very high ( many say too high) in Japan, regardless of age, so it's unlikely that anyone would be charged with these additional prefectural charges unless there was very strong evidence. \n\n\nNot saying anything about whether any of this is good or bad, but that's the way it is.",

There is no law stating sex with above 13 is legal. The law says sex with under is illegal. A local law saying sex with under 17 is illegal is not overriding national law, because the local law covers ages 13-17 in that case which is not covered by national.\n\nYou\u2019re right that there are also other laws on top of that, and it\u2019s also widely more complex in most areas than simple cutoffs as you often have various age spans which require parental consent and so on. But still, no prefecture has it legal for under 16 if their partner is over that. There are a couple of prefectures that allow if both are underage though.",

Laws in our state said three year age gap for 16-18 year olds so we had 5 days outside of legality.\n\nThe other funny part of this is that we chose to get married a year later, but our state has an age of majority of 19 - meaning we can't get married without parental consent (which isn't happening). But we're close to another state so we go there and get hitched.\n\nYears later we're hanging with some friends and telling stories and, as I'm telling this one, I realize it's actually a story about me taking a (18 year old) minor across state lines to get married. My wife hates it when I describe the story that way but I get a kick out of it.",

The age of consent was 14 in Canada from 1890 until 2008.  That means, unless the older person is in a position of authority (teacher, doctor, etc.) or involves exploitative activity (like porn or prostitution), a 14-year-old could legally consent to an adult of any age.  Under the close-in-age exemption, a 12-13yo could consent to a person up to 2 years older.\n\nUnder current law (post-2008), the age of consent is 16.  There are close-in-age exemptions so that a 12-13yo can consent to a person up to 2 years older, and a 14-15yo can consent up to 5 years older.\n\n[More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_consent_reform_in_Canada)",

Actually, in many cases it's also codified in law that rape can only be committed by a man against a woman as well--I believe this is currently the case in the UK, for example. Lots of antiquated ideas about sexual violence still determine the content of laws against sexual assault, making it a lot harder for victims to get justice.",

Well, it's exactly as true as saying Japan has an age of consent of 13.\n\nSee, the United States genuinely doesn't have a *national* age of consent. As far as the federal government is concerned, any two people of any age can consent to sex with one another. But if I put that in a headline and showed it to you, you wouldn't think \"that's outrageous! I can't believe it! We have to do something immediately!\" You probably already know each state has its own age of consent, and you probably already know the lowest age of consent in any state is 16, so after reading my headline you'd immediately figure out I was just lying to you for clickbait. It's already illegal for an adult to have sex with a 13-year-old anywhere in the United States.\n\nSimilarly, Japan has a *national* age of consent of 13 (that's actually *better* than the United States' national age of consent of \"ehh, who cares,\" if we're thinking about it this way). And sure, if you stopped to think about it, you could probably guess that Japan was organized into state-like subdivisions (it is - prefectures), but you probably wouldn't have any idea which laws are passed at which level (national, prefectural, both). You don't have the necessary context to be critical of the claim about Japan's age of consent being 13 the way you have the necessary context to be critical of the claim about the United States' having no age of consent at all.\n\nAnd as it turns out, the lowest prefectural age of consent in Japan is - wait for it - 16! With some caveats:\n\nCaveat #1: Japan actually has a lot of weird indirect ways of enforcing an age of consent higher than the one they have on paper, both nationally and prefecturally. For example, it can be a crime to have sex with someone under 18 unless you're married to them. You can't get married until you're 16-20. Even the claim that Japan's national age of consent is 13 is already dubious.\n\nCaveat #2: There are technically a couple places in Japan where the age of consent genuinely is 13. They are unpopulated islands who do not have a prefectural government to pass a higher age of consent. The only people ever there are adult military personnel. It's a non-issue.\n\ntl;dr the outrage here isn't genuine - if it were, people would be even more outraged at the U.S. for having *no national age of consent at all.* This is just clickbait preying on people's willingness to accept seemingly crazy but ultimately untrue facts about WeIRd FoReIGn places.",

But since the change has no effect, might as well do it, so clueless people on the internet can stop claiming the age of consent in Japan is 13.",

On mainland China the minimum age is 14, rising to 16 in Hong Kong. In all Australian territories, the age of consent is 16, except for in South Australia and Tasmania, where it is 17.

[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can't believe that\n\nEdit: Found the study. \n\nThe question seems to have been \"I think it's okay if my hand slips during an argument\" (Translation by me). This is still very bad and definitely worse than I would have expected but it's not \"yeah I think I should be able to beat the shit out of her\".\n\nBoth are bad definitely but I do think there's a difference between a guy saying \"it's my right to beat my wife as much as I want\" and a guy saying \"sometimes you do something in anger\"\n\nThe study itself consisted of 1000 men (woman were also asked but their questions and answers aren't relevant for my comment). Some of them made errors on the form, so only 947 were actually evaluated in the statistic. There were quotas for education level and region, to ensure decent representation but they don't explain their specific methodology.\n\nSome of the other questions are also phrased badly in my opinion. Example: According to the study, 41% of men say it's fine for them to compliment women, look after them or catcall them. \n\nI think it's problematic to include all those in the same question because it puts catcalling in the same box as a short look after a woman has walked by or giving a compliment after talking for a few minutes already. \n\nSo, many men might consider catcalling wrong, but would still answer yes as they have no problem with a quick look.\n\nI'm not saying the study is total BS. It still shows that too many people are stuck in old-fashioned mindsets and that that needs to change. But I would argue that the study probably skews a bit toward the negative",

If you just talk about stuff in general you'd never know it, but then when we started talking about his fiancee he just started talking about how he's still going to strip clubs and how important it is that his fiancee knows how to cook and make sure to cook for him when he gets home, how she \"knows her place\" and everything. \n\nI was flabbergasted the whole time but my wife later told me she wasn't surprised at all, and that she's dated several men with whom she ended relationships when she had an inkling of how they truly are underneath. I feel women have a better sixth sense about these things because it's so important to them while as a guy I just never think about it.",

There was nothing going on between us, but we did work together and sometimes met at the gym. So one time we talk about gaining muscle and how it's so much easier for men due to higher testosterone and all that. I don't know exactly anymore what I said, but it was something like \"any guy that casually goes to the gym is stronger than 99% of all women\". And then she said, and I know the words exactly: \"Yes. I think about that a lot.\" That's really it, but it was clear that it was a security concern for her, or at least a serious thing to keep in mind. We were in our twenties and she was single, presumably also actively dating. I don't know, somehow it stuck with me. \n\nIt's as you said, as a guy you walk around with no care in the world and generally don't give a fuck about who might or might not be stronger than you. But as a woman the strength difference between you and pretty much 50% of the population is something to keep in mind.",

This study as far as i could see, (I've only skimmed through it), didnt checks for physical violence directly but did have a category called 'physical integrity'. This included intimate partner violence and reproductive rights. Germany has 23% with a bias toward this. However, if you look at developed nations and undeveloped nations, you will see that nations that are generally described as undeveloped get a significantly higher %. So this study at least shows it is split down that line. Which still isn't great, even the lowest on this scale ,the UK, had 8%, which I also don't consider great.\n\nEdit: was thinking I should probably mention as it could be misleading if I don't specify this, but the title is correct. On page 6, it does have a short note specifying what the title of this post said. However, this isn't the what the report is about, this report only references the 25% figure from UNDP about this statistic. It note 16 in the report, which says \"See dashboard 3 in UNDP (2022b).\" About where this figure came from. Which is admitadly I am struggling a bit to find.\n\nEdit: Never mind, found it. Link to the report the 25% figure came from.\n\nhttps://hdr.undp.org/womens-empowerment\n\nEdit: I was wrong, the title is wrong, not because its not in the report, but the report the report is refereceng dosent even have a section for anything along the line of what is being talked about. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Maybe they messed up and referenced the wrong place. And I doubt they mayde it up. Either way, it's just sloppy report writing as it's such a bad way to put a source in.",

Those are costly, because you need to train interviewers and those need to operate across whatever area you want to be representative for. If you're willing to pay for that, you can randomly sample streets, houses, apartments, household members. Usually this involves some (almost) random procedure (e.g., the person in the family who last had their birthday). You could save some money, by just sending out paper surveys to random adresses, but afaik this isn't done much anymore.\n\nMost surveys don't have that kind of cash, so they do phone or online surveys. Via phone is great, because it is relatively cheap and you can randomly sample phone numbers, by just taking an area code and then generating a string of numbers. Fun fact: back in the day it wasn't uncommon to accidentally call a fax machine. Sucks to be the caller in that case. One concern here is that landlines are less common and that people don't like to answer them anymore. I don't think phone surveys call mobile phones, but that might just be specific to where I live. No idea about the US. Obvious problem is that the definition of representative is that each member of the population has an equal probability to being sampled. But people have more than one mobile phone. Or none at all (well, this used to be at least).\n\nEspecially in cases like the german study mentioned above, where you want to reach young people, you'll probably have to do an online survey. There are tons of online access panels you can hire.  Basically, you come up with questions, program your survey, and send them a link. They send it to their members who get a small incentive. Now, the quality of the data is in large parts determined by the quality of the panel. Some providers curate their panels really carefully, to ensure that the panel itself is representative of the population. They can then give you a weighted data set that should (to fairly high degree) represent the population in question. However, most panels can't afford that. In those cases, your only option is to use quotas (e.g., for age, gender, school degree, etc.). This is great, but not strictly representative. Just quota-representative. Again, this is what the german survey did.",

She complained that she had no appetite.  She would have two bites of a sandwich and complain she was full.  If it wasn't for the 600-900 calories/day she got from beer, she would have died even younger.\n\nIn the 10 years I was with her, I never saw her get hit, but I saw some of the marks.  Black eyes (two incidences) and a split lip (one incidence).\n\nEven more heartbreakingly, my grandparents had 4 children.  1 son, 3 daughters.  The son turned out okay.  My grandfather liked him.  He could take him hunting and fishing and share activities he enjoyed.  My uncle was also in hockey from a young age through to adulthood so he had a coach and a team to buoy him when things were rough at home.\n\nThe three daughters, however, having grown up in an environment where it was normal for the male authority figure to treat his spouse with cruelty and violence, went on to have children with men who beat them.  4 out of 4 of the women in my grandfather's immediate family wound up victims of domestic abuse.\n\nIt's a sickness that spreads through families.  Had I known then what I know now, I would have had him behind bars.",

Among both men and women, \u201cbiased gender social norms are prevalent worldwide: almost 90% of people have at least one bias\u201d of the seven biases analysed, the report said.\n\n&gt;The report noted that prejudices remain \u201cdeeply embedded\u201d in society along with cultural bias and pressures that hinder women\u2019s empowerment. These prejudices \u201care widespread among men and women suggesting that these biases are deeply embedded and influences both men and women to similar degrees,\u201d the report said.\n\n&gt;Using data from the international research programme World Values Survey (WVS) collected between 2010-2014 and 2017\u20132022 from 80 countries and territories accounting *for at least 85 per cent of the global population, the index shoed \u201cno improvement in biases against women in a decade* despite powerful global and local campaigns for women\u2019s rights.\"\n\n&gt;More than half of the world\u2019s population- 69 per cent- believes that men make \u201cbetter\u201d political leaders as opposed to women while more than 40 per cent of people reportedly believe that men are better business executives than women, the report noted, adding, that only 27 per cent of people believe that women having the same rights as men is essential for a democracy while, 25 per cent of people believe that a man beating his wife is justifiable.\n\n&gt;Some 28 per cent believe that university education is more important for men than women while the head of the UNDP\u2019s Human Development Report Office, Pedro Conceicao said, \u201cSocial norms that impair women\u2019s rights are detrimental to society more broadly, dampening the expansion of human development.

But then again, half of the stuff in the study is based on hand waving. Equality indexes based solely on whether women are disadvantaged, life expectancy based solely on patterns of age specific mortality without any examination as to whether that is caused by biases, and questions with gender flipped are not asked are other major criticisms (thereby making this an index about discrimination against women and girls only).",

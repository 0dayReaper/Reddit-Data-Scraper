(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; The size of the flooded area in the Kherson region as a result of the Kakhovka dam breach has almost halved, Ukraine says - but experts and officials fear infectious diseases may spread in polluted waters.\n\n&gt; The World Health Organization&amp;#039;s Ukraine representative, Dr Jarno Habicht, told the BBC the situation was &amp;quot;Devastating&amp;quot; and providing safe, clean water was a priority.\n\n&gt; While Ukrainian officials said no cases of infectious illnesses have been reported so far, the city of Kherson - around 100km from the Kakhovka dam and badly affected by the floods - has introduced restrictions on the use of river water in order to prevent their spread. The flooding of houses and sewage facilities means the water is now highly polluted, the city military administration said, meaning that bathing, fishing and drinking the water, or giving it to animals, is prohibited.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/146wdxe/ukraine_floods_recede_but_fears_over_disease/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688535 tl;drs so far.\") | [Service Blackout](https://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/146cacj/joining_the_blackout_a_message_from_uautotldr/ \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Water**^#1 **Ukraine**^#2 **dam**^#3 **floods**^#4 **Ukrainian**^#5",

            "comment": "\\- From the Article:\n\nReturn of El Ni\u00f1o Threatens New Levels of Economic Destruction\r  \nThe world\u2019s most potent climate phenomenon risks sparking a chain reaction of dangerous weather, food shortages and blackouts that can disrupt supply chains and stoke inflation.\r  \nAs the world struggles to recover from Covid-19 and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine grinds on, the arrival of the first El Ni\u00f1o in almost four years foreshadows new damage to an already fragile global economy.\r  \n\r  \nThe shift to a warming phase from the cooler La Ni\u00f1a can generate chaos, especially in fast-growing emerging economies. Power grids strain and blackouts become more frequent. Extreme heat creates public health emergencies, while drought adds to fire risks. Crops are lost, roads are flooded and homes are destroyed.\r  \n\r  \nAccording to Bloomberg Economics modeling, previous El Ni\u00f1os resulted in a marked impact on global inflation, adding 3.9 percentage points to non-energy commodity prices and 3.5 points to oil. They also hit growth to gross domestic product, especially in Brazil, Australia, India and other vulnerable countries.\r  \n\r  \nCombined with more extreme weather and hotter temperatures due to accelerated climate change, the stage is now set for the world\u2019s costliest El Ni\u00f1o cycle since meteorologists started keeping track. It also adds to the dreaded risk of stagflation, in which inflation stays high even as the economy contracts. The Reserve Bank of India said it is carefully watching the climate phenomenon; Peru announced in March that it plans to spend more than $1 billion to counter climate and weather effects this year.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWith the world grappling with high inflation and recession risk, the arrival of the El Ni\u00f1o comes at exactly the wrong time,\u201d said Bhargavi Sakthivel, an economist for Bloomberg Economics based in London. While policy interventions tend to manipulate demand, El Ni\u00f1os typically affect supply. \u201cCentral banks are more limited in what they can do.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nExpected Impacts of El Ni\u00f1o on Global Weather\r  \nThe shift from La Ni\u00f1a will have profound impacts around the world\r  \nIn Chile, for example, El Ni\u00f1o could trigger heavy rains, which could in turn restrict access to the mines that supply almost 30% of the world\u2019s copper. Lower production and delayed shipments will have an affect on the price of the metal used in goods like computer chips, cars and home appliances.\r  \n\r  \nOr consider China, where sweltering temperatures are already killing livestock and stretching power grids. Drought last summer prompted Communist Party officials to shut off power to many factories in China for nearly two weeks, disrupting supplies for manufacturing giants including Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. Authorities anticipate more power shortages this summer.\r  \n\r  \nEven the price of a cup of coffee could go up if Brazil, Vietnam and other top suppliers get hit.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhen you have an El Ni\u00f1o occurring on top of the long-term warming trend, it\u2019s like a double whammy,\u201d said Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy.\r  \n\r  \nThe effects last for years. Economists at the Dallas Federal Reserve warned in 2019 that damage from El Ni\u00f1o cycles was \u201clikely to have a persistent negative impact on output growth\u201d and can even \u201cpossibly permanently alter income trajectories.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nClimate researchers also found compounding economic effects. Dartmouth scientists estimated that the 1997-1998 El Ni\u00f1o led to $5.7 trillion in lost gross domestic product the following five years. Their modeling estimates that by the end of this century, El Ni\u00f1os will have blocked some $84 trillion in GDP.\r  \n\r  \nBloomberg Economics Modeling\r  \nDeviations from baseline due to effects from El Ni\u00f1o\r  \nThe risks are most acute in the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere. El Ni\u00f1os can trim almost half a percentage point off annual GDP growth in India and Argentina, according to Bloomberg Economics modeling. Peru, Australia and the Philippines can see reductions of about 0.3 percentage point.\r  \n\r  \nSteep price increases worsen the impact. Even back in 2000, the International Monetary Fund warned that strong El Ni\u00f1os can add 4 percentage points to commodity-price inflation \u2014 and that\u2019s before taking into account the current impact of climate change.\r  \n\r  \nOverall rising temperatures amplify the effects of climate phenomena. The last three \u201ccool\u201d La Ni\u00f1a years \u2014 2020 to 2023 \u2014 were hotter than every El Ni\u00f1o year before 2015. The World Meteorological Organization calculates there is a 98% chance the combination of the accumulation of greenhouse gases and the return of El Ni\u00f1o will make the next five-year period the warmest yet, pushing global temperatures into uncharted territory.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cEl Ni\u00f1o will only worsen the impacts of climate change that we are already experiencing \u2014 hotter heatwaves, more severe drought and more extreme wildfire,\u2019\u2019 said Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment.",

We used to pay farmers not to grow in order to keep cereal prices sustainable, but in the 70s, we shifted away from that policy towards paying them to grow as much as possible. This led to a flood of grains into the international market because Americans, while obese, can't actually eat as much as we can produce. \n\nMore food = more population growth. More population growth = more resource requirements. More resource requirements = more carbon emissions. Basically, we're caught in a positive feedback loop because farmers need to grow as much as possible to make ends meet.\n\nIt's not their fault. It's a collective fault of everyone not wanting to stop the gravy train.",

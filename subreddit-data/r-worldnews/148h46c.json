The idea is that when people go to the beach or a lake, they usually remember that they might get burned and bring sunscreen. But it is in other public places that people don't think of it, but still get sunburned. These dispensers will be placed at such (busy) locations and also at events and festivals.\n\nThe idea stemmed from the practice of having desinfectant dispensers everywhere. We succeeded doing that, so the idea of doing the same with sunscreen in summer was then not so far-fetched.",

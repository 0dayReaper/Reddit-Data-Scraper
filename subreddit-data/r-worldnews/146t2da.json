Plus Ukraine gets some shiny new shit that hasn't been seen before. And Surprise is a bitch when she has a tow missile.",

The fact that the 4 that have are China, Russia, and the 2 most sanctioned countries on the planet that just happens to be allies with one of the other two is pretty suspicious.",

There are reports of patriot batteries hit by those missiles. While both side publishes propaganda for obvious reasons, a Russian missile hitting the patriot battery is also admitted by the American side.  \n  \nThere was also a lot of footage circulating yesterday of a bunch of Bradleys and German Leopard 2 tanks destroyed by Russian FPV drones.",

If they couldn't intercept hypersonic missiles, there'd already be no AA left because Russia would've destroyed all of them with hypersonic missiles. One patriot was damaged and repaired, which was admitted, and it is uncertain that it was because of a hypersonic missile. They could've just denied it like those terrorists I mean Russian army would have. Russians had footage of \"western tanks\" being destroyed long before there were actually any of those tanks in Ukraine, and have claimed many ridiculous things like destroyed farm equipment being tanks.

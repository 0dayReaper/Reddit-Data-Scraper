[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Uranium is heavy so it comes in with more kinetic energy and explodes when it hits a target.\n\nI doubt anyone reading this is actually fighting or will fight in Ukraine, but if you see a destroyed piece of Russian armor from a depleted uranium round stay away from it.  My kickboxing instructor developed gulf war syndrome, exposure to depleted uranium is thought to be one of the causes.",

The main difference is that when it strikes a target, the projectile is self-sharpening rather than becoming mushroom shaped on the end. That gives it a slight advantage in penetration ability. Uranium is also pyrophoric, so when it penetrates a target, all the small fragments from the dart will burn and start fires.",

Being exposed to the burning oil fields is the most likely cause.\n\nCivilians nowhere near the fighting have similar symptoms to gulf war syndrome, including those in Iran and Saudi Arabia where no fighting took place.\n\nBut by all means, stay away from damaged Russian vehicles. UXO is a serious issue, and the residue explosives leave behind is just as - if not more - toxic than the Uranium.\n\nI think it's the case that all modern explosives are poisonous or toxic in some way. A lot more non-uranium is used to the Uranium exposure is usually minimal.\n\nYou had similar birth defect spikes in France post-WWI and in Europe as a whole post-WW2 because ALL munitions are in some way toxic, and if you don't have good water filtration, the contaminants are going to get into the water.\n\nThat's why France *still today* has a red zone that is toxic. And it's not just chemical weapons, it's fragments of shells, it's UXO.\n\nAll warfare is poisonous.\n\nFocusing in on one weapon or one system, like the DU which Russians have been using since day 1 in Crimea, ignores the danger that all weapons pose.",

They're not mad about any toxicity, they're mad that this will allow western tanks to kill Russian ones from outside the Russian ones' firing range.\n\nThe 2A46 125mm gun in Russian tanks is the same one they've been using since the 1960s. It can't penetrate the frontal armor of western tanks, but those tanks aren't totally invincible to all Russian weapons.\n\nBut Abrams can sit outside of Russian tanks' firing range and completely devastate them. Especially at night, western tanks can see for kilometers, when the best Russian optics can't see a full kilometer.\n\nAnd so that's what the Russians are mad about.\n\nUkrainian tanks are going to go night-sniping, and Russia can't respond. In open terrain, Ukrainian tanks are going to hit Russian armor, and Russian tanks will take pot shots at systems they can't penetrate.",

Vehicles produce a lot of heat. \n\nExample: https://i.imgur.com/UuzbxeY.png\n\nSo if the vegetation is light enough (they obviously can't see through dense woodland) and there's a tank concealed in the bushes with some tree branches on the other side of a grassy field, or on the next hilltop over holding the high ground, camouflage doesn't matter.\n\nThey will see a tank that is a few km away but couldn't normally be seen with the naked eye. And due to poor thermals, the Russians won't see the Ukrainians sneaking up on them, even from the front.\n\nThe area they're invading is a bit hillier just now, but if the Russians attempt a counterattack and the Ukrainians are hulled down, it's going to be a slaughter.\n\nEspecially if the Ukrainians are equipped with CUAS as they appear to be, because that will preclude any Russian drones spotting them.\n\nThe difference between Russian and Western thermal sights is that western ones are cooled. A cooled thermal sight is orders of magnitude more expensive, but has a maximum range of several kilometers rather than dozens of meters for the uncooled sights. \n\nEven the T-14 Armata was going to be equipped with non-cooled sights. They're too expensive and Russia doesn't have the expertise to make them.\n\nAnother issue is smoke. \n\nSomeone has edited the top of the wikipedia page, but the T-90 uses an upgraded engine of the same design as the one found on the T-34. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_model_V-2\n\nSo do all other Russian tanks. To keep costs down, they've just kept using the same engine. It's old-fashioned, and extremely smoky. \n\nHere's just one frame of some Russian armor turning a corner:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/M6__KVnXFEU?feature=share&amp;t=5286\n\nWhen it changes to the forward angle, do you see how smoky that is?\n\nSo if Russians are approaching, and you see this big puff of smoke on the horizon slowly getting bigger, you know it's a Russian armor column and can lay an ambush.\n\nHere's a Polish military parade. This is the tail end of like, 200 leopards. No smoke. But notice what happens in a few seconds when the M-113 rolls by and the Polish soviet-era tanks show up.\n\nChoking columns of smoke.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EXyHEPakmz0?t=786\n\nSo you look for the smoke (which Western tanks don't produce) you use your thermals to look through vegetation (and the enemy tanks KMs away on the other side of the field hidden in the bushes light up like the sun) and you'll see them before they see you.",

DU self-sharpens on impact. The head of the rod shapes into a mushroom on impact, which starts to shed material as the round passes through armor and sharpens the DU rod, further increasing penetration.\n2. The depleted uranium has pyrophoric properties, which makes for a bigger ''flash'' on penetration. Essentially making it somewhat of an incendiary round.",

There's a big issue with the concept however, and it's that:\n\nA) You need to actually spend that amount of energy in rocket fuel to get the tungsten rod into orbit in the first place, which is stupidly impractical\n\nB) Most of the energy delivered is dumped downwards into compressing the ground and is completely wasted.\n\nAtomic ICMBs detonate a few hundred metres above the ground to maximise the radius of the shockwave. If the same bomb was detonated below the ground the damage is hugely less.\n\nAll up it's much easier to just nuke something.",

DU is only marginally more toxic than tungsten, the alternative metal used in kinetic penetrators (\"Sabot\", although Sabot refers to the lightweight material around the penetrator that's used to stabilize the projectile in the barrel and catch the propellant gases) and the vast amount of that toxicity is due to being a heavy metal, not because it's minimally radioactive.\n2. Ukraine, while dry, is not nearly as dry as Iraq. A good rain will bind DU dust into mud and reduce the chance of heavy metal dust entering the body.\n3. Any target hit by a DU round should be decontaminated by crew wearing protective masks with NBC filters. gloves suited to chemical decontamination and at a minimum all clothes need to be washed afterwards.  Preferably there should also be topsoil removal in the immediate area around the blown up vehicle. Ie, like most heavy metal contamination.",

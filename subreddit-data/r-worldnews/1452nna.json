Some uyghurs joined ISIS and did terrorists acts. ISIS were trained by CIA. Also using American weapons.

So china is trying to integrate them by teaching them skills to earn more money and not join terrorists organisations. \n\nNo doubt the few that are suspected to be terrorists will be treated badly. \n\nOr you know...ignore everything and \"china bad\" mentality.",

Like for example if you fly using a national airline they probably don't charge entrance/exit fees with the ticket sale since citizens don't pay those fees. And if you buy a round trip where you use one airline, in and another airline out then it's possible you've paid all, half, or none. Further, it's common to be cash only so you have to deal that at the same time.\n\nLike I'm all for the practice in theory, tourism should be appropriately taxed and compensated. But it's one more headache in the airport and the airport is already my least favorite place on planet earth.",

The United States has the $21 ESTA, valid for two years, and Europe will be introducing the 7 euro ETIAS (about $7.50 on exchange rates this week) in 2024. That one will last you three years.  \n\\&gt; The United Kingdom, you may recall, rather famously fled the EU coop a couple of years back. Now it\u2019s revealed the price tag for its own scheme, the ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation): \u00a310 (about $12.50) for two years.\n\nSo TLDR: Because UK left EU, they no longer charge for ETIAS. So they introduced their own charge, just how the US and EU do.\n\nThis really doesn't sound like news.",

Both the UK and Ireland have laws that essentially mean citizens of the other country don\u2019t count as foreign. Hence the freedom to travel. \n\nThere\u2019s no treaty though, so the arrangement could end tomorrow or become a one way deal if Ireland or the UK changed their domestic legislation, not that there\u2019s much chance of that happening. The closest thing to an actual agreement is a non binding joint declaration to maintain the arrangement.",

Wut?  \n\nOr do they think special tall planes will be designed to fit these?  Only budget airline would want these and they are not going to pay extra for special tall planes.  \n\nAlso boarding would take ages and budget airlines don't want a slow turn around limiting how many flights they can do a day.  \n\nAnother dumb gimmick idea that they know will never happen but for some reason people keep paying money to develop these.  It's like the standing seats they made, everyone knew they'd never be allowed on safety grounds.",

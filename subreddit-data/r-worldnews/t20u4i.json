            "comment": "&gt;Russia will be disconnected from the international payment system SWIFT. The official decision has not yet been formalized, but technical preparations for the adoption and implementation of this step have already begun, said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on his Facebook page.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"We gnawed and gnawed and gnawed at it. All Ukrainian diplomacy worked \u2013 from the President of Ukraine to the attach\u00e9 in the Ukrainian embassy. Ukrainian diplomats dedicate this victory to all defenders of Ukraine,\" Kuleba wrote.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sources close to negotiation process on the policy of sanctions told the Ukrainian news outlet LB.ua that after the consent of Hungary and Cyprus, only the position of Germany was preventing the disconnection of Russia from SWIFT. Such step requires the consent of all EU member states. The Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's editor, Rikard Jozwiak,  has reported that Germany has also given its consent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;SWIFT, which stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, is controlled by the National Bank of Belgium and central banks from the US, UK, EU, Japan, Russia, China and others. It delivers secure messages to more than 11,000 financial institutions and companies in more than 200 countries and territories.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Only one country was removed from SWIFT in its history. in 2012, Iran was blocked from SWIFT as part of a series of measures aimed at curbing the Islamic Republic's nuclear program.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed hope that Germany and Hungary would have the courage to support the decision to disconnect Russia from SWIFT.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"The blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on the hands of those who will block Russia's disconnection from SWIFT,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said earlier. He also called on the world community to completely isolate Russia, expel ambassadors, impose an oil embargo and destroy the aggressor's economy.",

I know that the resources and strategic value of the location are too essential but crippling the economic infrastructure for Russia wasn\u2019t used back in 2014. How much will this hurt Russia is what I guess I\u2019m asking.",

That's what the big research paper says\n\nLots of countries don't trade enough to make that big of a difference but SWIFT brings the numbers to 5% of GDP. That's significant especially with everything else that is happening on top of it. The study mentions effective ones were 2%.\n\nThe sanctions were going to be too small but getting SWIFT makes a huge difference.\n\nThe real caveat is I heard rumblings about a carve out for gas which would drastically reduce the 5% number.",

There have been others that rivaled him in specific areas, but none that can ever write the influence over the influencers, and be able to do it so remotely so quickly. He can literally threaten everyone he has dirt on in real time, where previous dictators either had a smaller reach out limited communication...

Imagine if Russia hadn't such shit leaders all the time but genuine people who where friendly and supportive to the world. That we could go to Russia and enjoy the rich heritage, the beautiful old cities, the beautiful nature, Tchaikovsky, their metro stations without having double feelings about spending money and thus supporting imperialism, war crimes, suppression of Russian civilians who speak their minds. That our students could go there on exchange and build international friendships with Russian people. 80 years ago this was not possible in Germany either. Now I can (and do) enjoy Germany and have German friends. So perhaps there is hope it will be possible with Russia as well one time. It would require Putin and his friends to be removed and a huge denouncement of these dark times similar as Germany did after WW2.",

But the other truth is they have a land border with Russia, one thats a potential weakness in the event of conflict with the West. Yes Russia would use such a conflict to capitalize in Europe, but they could also use it to make gains from China's north. This is why India is close to Russia, to expose China's north should India and China be in a conflict.\n\nSo while China has interests in undermining the West, it also has interests in undermining Russia. This entire thing is a win/win for them, either the West folds and Russia remains a strong threat to the West and focused out in Europe, or Russia loses too much strength fighting this and isnt a threat.",

SWIFT uses standardized codes for instructions that enable banks to process payments quickly.\n\nIt was founded in 1973. In 2021, the service was used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries. It processes around 10 billion financial messages a year.\n\nWho owns SWIFT?\n\nSWIFT is owned by member banks. It is governed by a 25-member board of directors. According to its website, it is overseen by the G10 central banks \u2014 Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Great Britain, the United States, Switzerland and Sweden \u2014 as well as the European Central Bank.\n\nHow is it used?\n\nThe format is used by financial institutions to facilitate cross-border payments.\n\nFor instance, if a company in France is buying a product from Russia, the French company can transfer money from its French bank account to the Russian company\u2019s bank account by using the Russian company\u2019s account number and its SWIFT code.\n\nThe French company will then send a message via SWIFT to the Russian company that the transfer of the money is incoming, and that it can access the funds.\n\nWhat happens if Russia is removed from SWIFT?\n\nIf Russia is removed from SWIFT, the country\u2019s ability to do business with other countries would be impacted. Shipments of metals, oil, gas and other commodities could stop for at least some period of time.\n\n\u201cIf Russia is disconnected from SWIFT, then we will not receive [foreign] currency, but buyers, European countries in the first place, will not receive our goods,\u201d Nikolai Zhuravlev, vice speaker of Russia\u2019s upper house of parliament, said last month.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the European Central Bank has warned lenders that Russia may be suspended from SWIFT.\n\nIf Russia is suspended from SWIFT, the country would see a significant economic disruption for a period of time, Elina Ribakova, an economist at the Washington-based Institute for International Finance, told Radio Free Europe.\n\nThe disruption could cause the Russian economy to contract and send the country\u2019s currency, the ruble, tumbling in the short term, Ribakova said.\n\nA major disruption would likely be temporary, though, as Russia would have some tools to combat a suspension.\n\nWhat can Russia do about it?\n\nRussia does have its own payment system, the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS), but it is a much smaller operation than SWIFT.\n\nSPFS has around 400 users and is responsible for about 20% of domestic transfers, so being cut off from SWIFT would cause major financial problems for the country.\n\nSource: https://www.kiro7.com/news/trending/what-is-swift-what-happens-if-russians-are-cut-off-it/HIUXX6HZK5DV7GPT77ETSI6XDY/\n\nEdit: added source as requested.",

And every step along the way takes a cut, and maybe also extra time.\n\nSo in the end, more expensive to do business with foreign partners.",

Because deserting soldiers give away their Intel, might turn their comrades away from their mission as well and can start a snow ball system of deserting. A dead comrade usually just angers/saddens their comrades. Cheer at those deserting their forces and joining the Ukrainians.",

Pyrrhus was a very capable military leader, even regarded highly by Hannibal. Also, it should be noted that he was very aware of the cost of his victories so its not like he was repeatedly making the same mistakes. While you aren't wrong, the way you phrased it shows the man in a bad light when, by all accounts, he was a tactical genius. After all, its not so easy to beat the Romans multiple times.",

And it isn't because they're tech innovators or anything. Pretty much none of the \"captains of industry\" that existed in the 90s and early 2000s are still around. Putin got rid of all of Yeltsin's guys and replaced them with his own. We're a few generations of \"businessmen\" removed from the guys that plundered the wreckage of the former USSR, at this point. They owe everything to Putin (and Mogilevich), by design. Quite literally a mafia state.\n\nedit: also, Mogilevich was born in Ukraine, which exhibits the complicated history at play, but also gives insight into why the Russian mob (ahem: State) is so interested in maintaining its sphere of influence and control over Ukraine",

That was definitely true in 20 years ago, but multiple sources are saying the situation has changed.\n\nLike you said, he used the oligarchs initially, then moved quickly to increase his power through the military, police, and law enforcement agencies (like the tax agencies, which have been used aggressively to control businessmen).\n\nHis current crew seems to be people like Nikolai Patrushev and Sergei Lavrov while the businessmen and oligarchs are on the outside of the inner circle:\n\nhttps://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/01/25/as-markets-crash-and-war-fears-grow-russias-business-elite-suffers-in-silence-a76142\n\nIn many ways what he did is classic dictator tactics:\n\nGet power, take over the police and military, use them to subdue all of your former allies and enemies. Its not that different from what people like Saddam, Qaddafi, etc. did. It was just more complicated in Russia but the result seems to be roughly the same.",

[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

One could say the sentence is implied (ie. \"That is your opinion.\"), however then one could also say that his statement being his opinion is equally self-evident, which begs the question: Why say anything at all?\n\nNo, surely you wouldn't say something when saying nothing accomplishes the same thing. So 'Your opinion.' can't possibly mean \"That is your opinion.\" Perhaps \"I do not share your opinion.\" or \"I disagree with your opinion.\" These at least bring new information to the discussion. You could, however, mean just the opposite, as in \"Your opinion aligns with my own,\" but that seems less likely.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is, I can't wait till the subreddits aren't dark so I can spend my time elsewhere.",

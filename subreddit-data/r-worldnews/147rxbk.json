[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Clearly there is also room, just like in real cases, for mitigating circumstances - but one of the core problems that were running into repeatedly is that beyond a certain size, (esp. publicly traded multinationals) there is basically no accountability for corps (and the people that run them) and increasingly that isn't just a economic and labor rights issue. Increasingly it is a national security issue, and I would go so far as to say that it is probably the biggest threat to international geopolitical stability in the world right now. With great power *should* come great responsibility, but it doesn't.\n\nYou could also argue that laws should bend the other way and minimize collateral damage to bystanders and overuse of force, but we don't do that either.",

Whoever controls Taiwan VERY much controls the technological cutting edge of the world.\n\nBecause if China controls Taiwan then either the world collectively falls several years back in tech level because Taiwan destroyed all it's foundries so China can't get them OR... China gets to control the tech, meaning that in long term the internet would be controlled by China. The West now needs to beg China for scraps of these semiconductors and China gets to dictate the terms. Our tech industries would pretty much decay and collapse, costing us tens (if not hundreds) of millions of well educated, highly paid jobs.\n\nYou can't JUST make the same factories Taiwan has. Taiwan's entire industry is based on making the best semiconductors possible and they evolved their society and economy to it for decades. You will always play catch up, especially if China also keeps developing that tech to keep pushing forward too. It would take decades to overtake them (and that's with \"all hands on deck let's make it the #1 priority\"). Decades which China could use to overtake the US as a superpower.\n\nThe damage the West would take would be immeasurable.\n\nWhich is why Taiwan being at the very least \"neutral\" (but most certainly independent) is in the West's interest and 100% a \"let's go to war with China and risk WW3 to keep it that way\" reason. It really is an economic linchpin in it's importance.",

The Holocaust was *viewed as* a just a righteous pursuit by Nazis, while it *was* a genocide.\n\nSimilarly I don't care that ip is *viewed as* incentivizing innovation or creativity (it does neither), I do care that IP \"protections\" restrict the right of individuals to speak and share information freely in order for the \"inventor\" to retain an absurd, nonexistent right of exclusivity over an idea.",

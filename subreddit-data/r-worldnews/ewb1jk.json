You land in NYC at 5pm local. Your seatmate caught it from you but won't be contagious for six days. You take an Uber to the Manhattan for your hotel and have business meetings the next two days in the city, with dinner meetings each night. Four more people are tagged by you before you take your flight back to LA. Hopefully one of them isn't a cab or uber driver! You start feeling the sniffles as you land. By the next morning you feel like shit, and start to think, \"Wuhan?\"\n\nIt's now Thursday 9am. Your first infected person, your Monday LA to NYC seatmate, will be contagious sometime on Saturday, and will show symptoms on the next Tuesday.

            "comment": "TLDR: Do not panic, the world is monitoring the situation closely. Be critical of media reports that are often designed to illicit an emotional/political response. There are capable people on top of this including epidemiologists, clinicians, etiological researchers (me), the list goes on. The virus is an emergency in China and now deemed a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC): https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\n\nIt's basically a boost to funding/various resources needed to contain the threat. WHO will ensure proper public health policies. There is more pressure on member nations to coordinate. This is **not** a pandemic, it is further recognition that the situation warrants more measures going forward\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\nWish I could post more, but here's a mini primer on the whole situation with some of my insights. For the most part, I've noticed that discussion on Reddit concerning the Wuhan coronavirus seems to be on point, scientifically. Aside from the occasional fear mongering, misinformation, anti-China sentiment, and jokes about Plague Inc, I feel like general knowledge (at least on Reddit) on the epidemic is pretty decent which is always nice to see. There is research done on social media during these disease outbreaks (2009 pandemic) so comments might be used in a study that influences public health policy. \n\n\nFor questions, please visit the askscience [megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/etkdx1/coronavirus_megathread/). *There's no such thing as a stupid question, just a stupid answer.* Please *do* ask if you're worried or unsure.\n\n\n---\n\n**What do you need to know?**\n\n\nAs of 23:59 Jan 29, there are officially:\n\n\n**7711** confirmed cases in China across **31** provinces\n\n\n**5794** suspected cases. **81947**/88693 are under medical observation\n\n\n**170** deaths and **1370** are severe cases. 162/170 deaths occurred in Hubei province (where Wuhan is). The rest are within various provinces in China\n\n\n* 17 deaths range from 48-89 years old. **14/17** deaths are of the elderly above 65 years old. Most have pre-existing conditions that seem to predispose to a more severe disease presentation. People who are already sick prior to infection may be more at risk due to decreased immunity. Some of these people had hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. Death was typically the result of severe respiratory failure but includes others like multi-organ failure. Info on some of the remaining deaths is currently unknown\n\n* Healthy people have died\n\n* 124 people **recovered**\n\n**90** exported cases: Thailand (14), Japan (11), Hong Kong/Singapore (10), Taiwan (8), Macao/Australia/Malaysia (7 each), USA/France (5 each), Germany/South Korea/UAE (4 each), Canada (3), Vietnam (2), Nepal/Cambodia/Finland/Sri Lanka (1 each)\n\n#Please refer to the live trackers for the most up-date statistics\n\n**Initial symptoms**\n\n* cough\n* fever (pyrexia possible absence in young individuals)\n* fatigue, discomfort (malaise), shortness of breath (dyspnea), dizziness, chest tightness, headache, muscle aches, chills, sore throat\n* possible atypical presentations in immunosuppressed/elderly\n\n**Treatment**\n\nNo cure, care is supportive to relieve symptoms. Drugs and vaccines are being explored\n\n---\n\n**Rough Timeline of Some Key Events**\n\n| Date | 2019-nCoV |\n|:-----:|:------------:|\n|Dec 1|Earliest known patient with symptom onset\n|Dec 24| Collection of genomic sequence based on atypical pneumonia\n|Dec 31| WHO notified\n|Jan 1| Seafood market is closed + decontaminated \n|Jan 8| Novel coronavirus identified\n|Jan 10| Dr. Zhang (Shanghai) releases genome, first fatality\n|Jan 13| 1st exported case in Thailand\n|Jan 19| First diagnostic test \n|Jan 20| Human-Human transmission confirmed\n|Jan 23| CEPI funding of vaccine development, quarantine begins\n|Jan 28| Australia is 1st to grow virus outside China\n|Present/Onwards|animal modeling, ID of reservoir, intermediate hosts, pathogenesis, pathophysiology\n\n---\n\n**Some things healthcare professionals are doing + will do**\n\n* Largest quarantine in the history of public health (**~15** cities, combined population ~56 million)\n* Diagnostic testing: Molecular diagnostics, cell culture, microscopy, antigen/antibody detection, serosurveys \n* Genomic analyses: gives us an idea of drug targets, transmission, etc\n* vaccine development: at least 4 different vaccines confirmed \n* Preparation of animal modeling: testing clinical manifestations etc\n* Epidemiological tracking: people at risk, super spreaders, R0 value, gen time etc \n\n---\n\n#Some Insights\n\n* It shares a crucial protein with SARS. We're targeting this for drugs. Existing compounds are already being tested in China for treatment\n\n* Use of masks alone is insufficient to prevent infection. It can worsen problems if people believe all you need is a mask. More hygiene measures are needed: wash hands, sneeze/coughing into a disposable tissue, maintain distance of &gt;1 m: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-health-care-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\n\n* Incubation period for the first 425 patients was 5.2 days. R0 differs by study. If R0 &gt; 1, the epidemic will increase. We aim to reduce this number to &lt; 1. **R0 = 2.2** so on average, each patient will infect 2.2 other people. Other factors play into this, like immunity\n\n* Of the first 425 patients: 240 (56%) were male. **No** cases for children under age 15. **84** cases for ages 15-44. **179** cases between ages 45-64. **162** cases for age 65 and over. Incubation period for the first 425 patients was 5.2 days. Nearly **half** of cases occurred people over age 60. It's possible that children *are* infected but show milder symptoms. In the coming weeks, once developed, a seroprevalence study (where we test your blood serum) will give us a much better idea.\n\n* What we're monitoring is whether exportation of cases in other countries can sustain transmission. This is crucial leading up to a pandemic. Circulation within the community is bad news. It's why surveillance, isolation, and why close contacts are being monitored.\n\n* China does deserve some credit. If you compare the timeline with the SARS outbreak, we are doing **way** better (availability of data, transparency, measures of control, research). China hid reports of SARS and took 4 months to report to the WHO. It took **5 months to even identify** it was a coronavirus and sequence the genome. We had a genome to analyze in lab within 11 days of their announcement to WHO. I remember laying in bed and jumping up when I was notified that the complete genome was available, pretty excited\n\n* I also want to stress that it is quite easy to sit behind a screen and throw blame around. Granted there are certain contributing factors leading to this outbreak but in my opinion, there is a time to address those. At the moment, there needs to be a focus on containment and research. If you're outside of China and worried about it, consider how it would feel to be **in** China.

                    "comment": "So apparently 10k is the character limit. There are many more resources I wanted to add. I'm so sorry I wish I could have given more frequent updates but as it is, it's a pretty busy. I have my own lab research to do with long hours. It's an amazing time to be a scientist focusing on infectious diseases. It's exciting, scary, and crazy stressful. It's exactly what I signed up for. Anyways, I've read about 32 research papers since my last update 5 days ago. If there is incorrect information in my previous post, please correct me. I've got a lot on my plate. So after all that, these are some of my conclusions based on preliminary data: \n\n1. I have no life\n\n2. Multiple institutions are racing to develop vaccines. Vaccines will take a long time before they're deployed. When testing *any* treatment, there are multiple phases. Basically, these phases ensure adequate testing for safety/efficacy. Don't expect the vaccine in a few months (note China may expedite the process). For the SARS outbreak, it took 20 months before they even started the first phase of human trials. By that time, the outbreak was under control. Hong Kong already has a vaccine, the issue now is testing it on animals before human trials begin. \n\n3. There are many ways to attack this virus. Antivirals targeting crucial proteins made by the virus are one. We can stop the proteins needed to bind our cells or block their ability to replicate. And to be safe, we use a combination of these methods (and others) in order to prevent the virus from evolving resistance to our drugs. Antibodies (made in our body) can be tailored as well. There are tons of these in development and for good reason. These monoclonal antibodies can \"mark\" infected cells for our immune system to take care of. It gets complicated but the basics can be read here: https://www.cell.com/trends/microbiology/fulltext/S0966-842X(15)00154-7. But at the end of the day, vaccines are arguably the best method of preventing disease. Not only that, estimates show for every 1$ spent on vaccines, there is a return of [44$](https://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2016/expanding-use-of-vaccines-could-save-up-to-44-dollars-for-every-dollar-spent-study-suggests.html)\n\n4. I'm seeing **a lot** of worry. It worries me to see that amount of worry. I understand it because many people just don't understand the science of it and media sources are often sensationalist. Not to mention this is arguably the biggest outbreak since the popularity of social media. It's a double edged sword, more information also happens to turn into misinformation. Be critical of media sources. Given the numbers right now, it can be hard to keep perspective. China is home to ~1.4 billion and we're seeing cases in the 8000s. The odds of getting the disease are still low and even lower outside of China. Tight monitoring of people worked to contain SARS and it is working now to protect people abroad  \n\n5. Bats are very likely the reservoir host. It originated from bats so it is a zoonotic pathogen. There is now a search for an intermediate host. This is an organism that is the bridge to infecting us. In fact, there is [evidence](http://virological.org/t/ncov-2019-spike-protein-receptor-binding-domain-shares-high-amino-acid-identity-with-a-coronavirus-recovered-from-a-pangolin-viral-metagenomic-dataset/362) (posted this morning) that it might have come from a pangolin. Given the variety of animals in the wet market, I wouldn't be surprised if those were in the market. Time will tell. It's been reported that China found the virus in animals found at the Huanan Seafood Market (a crucial step if true). There is also evidence the virus came from a snake (but with tons of evidence to the contrary)\n\n6. There's speculation that China is voluntarily hiding how much people are infected. Possible, but to me, not likely. It also happens to be peak \"normal\" flu season. Initially in infectious disease, the cases reported are the tip of the iceberg. There is a high likelihood that there are more \"hidden\" cases that we can detect due to the spectrum of illness. Mild symptoms in people are often ignored and you don't immediately go testing for a serious strain of influenza (much less a new virus that infected a couple of people). We see more severe cases and will tend to miss less severe ones. Ex: there were cases where people infected with the virus but didn't visit the market. This supports the idea that the virus was already present in the population. As diagnostic methods develop, we get an increase in cases and understand more about transmission dynamics\n\n7. Data suggests that the zoonotic event (animal to human event) happened recently. There is very low diversity between sequenced genomes. This is suggestive that China reported the virus early and that the virus is young. /u/RollingLord said it better than me: the virus has not had time to undergo a large number of mutations from the original virus that infected patient zero \n\n8. Now that I've droned on about why you shouldn't worry, there's some things I *am* worried about. As the virus circulates, we look for mutations that enable it to spread more efficiently. I'm also worried about how \"hyped\" this has become. There's a fascination with pathogens that are new and mysterious, nothing wrong with that. The issue is when the media posts eye-catching inaccurate titles made to attract clicks and generate revenue. Media coverage has been real extensive when honestly the risk to countries abroad is being handled quite well for the moment. Don't be mistaken, we're *very* vigilant because things can change very quickly. I've also seen reports of China censoring people (including doctors). Not a big fan. A lot of times I wish scientists could be politicians.. but I digress\n\n9. Some drugs are currently being researched for treatment: Nelfanivir, Indinavir, Saquinavir, Remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir. Pitavastatin, Perampanel, and Praziquantel [**might**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.921627v1) have moderate activity against the main viral protease. Lopinavir/Ritonavir is under a controlled randomized trial in China for hospitalized patients. Drugs that are already clinically approved for treatment of other viruses have been shown to have moderate activity against other pathogens. Nelfanivir is used for HIV-1. \n\n10. Likely binding to ACE2 human host receptor. There is confirmed variance in the \"spike\" protein compared to SARS. These spikes give coronavirus its name and also are necessary for binding to our cells among other functions. It has sequence variation with other strains. There are 51 available genomes with variations found in 8 strains so far. There are mutations but none are at the crucial binding interface. That's good.\n\n11. Transmission is likely through large droplets and fomites based on experience with SARS/MERS. Still to be confirmed. Droplets are made when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Fomite transmission requires contamination of a surface (table, door knob, *phone* etc). Viral shedding is high when you're sick. Bodily secretions will have high amounts of viruses (blood, saliva, nasal fluid etc). For example: if sick and you sneeze on your phone, that fomite is now contaminated. We touch our faces constantly during the day (one [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637115) claims 276 times per day but estimates can go **way** higher). If you touch your phone and touch your nose, mouth, or eyes, you greatly increase the chances of getting sick. One reason why some agencies don't recommend using a mask is because it increases the odds you'll have to adjust your mask, thus increasing odds of you getting sick\n\n12. There are cases that show further infection with bacteria and fungi. This is to be expected. If you get infected with the coronavirus and your immune system is weakened, it is possible for subsequent infections. *Acinetobacter baumannii*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, and *Aspergillus flavus* were found in a patient. Compounding the issue is drug resistance. *A. baumannii* is drug resistant. 4 other fungal infections: 1 from *Candida glabrata* and 3 from *Candida albicans*.\n\n13. Pandemic phases might be of interest to some. Based on past outbreaks, WHO defines certain parameters needed to be declared a [pandemic](https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/phase/en/) \n\n--\n**References (some not open to the public)**\n\nEDIT: [Asymptomatic transmission confirmed](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001468?query=featured_coronavirus), [1st US case](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191?query=featured_coronavirus)\n\n[Emergence of coronaviruses](https://jvi.asm.org/content/88/10/5209)\n\nCoronavirus review: [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25681), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5456285/)\n\nGenome characterisation: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30251-8/fulltext\n\nAnalysis of family cluster: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30154-9/fulltext\n\n[Early transmission dynamics](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316?query=featured_home)\n\nHubs: [New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/coronavirus), [Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/coronavirus), [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/connect/coronavirus-information-center)\n\n[Potential inhibitors from clinically approved medicine preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.924100v1)\n\n[Evidence for evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25688?af=R)\n\n[Mini summary of outbreak](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2759815)\n\n[Genome characterization](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2020.1719902)\n\n[Significance of fomites in spread of respiratory and enteric disease](https://aem.asm.org/content/73/6/1687)",

It is worse than influenza normally is, and it is a new strain and as such we have limited info about it and no proven treatment.\n\nETA: I answered this to deleted comment but thought it could be valuable here as well.\n\nSpanish flu is H1N1 and so is the 2009 inflluenza but the CFRs are different between 1918-1919 and 2009.

Treatment of viral infection and respiratory diseases are mostly supportive (antivirals are not proven to work). Need oxygen? We give oxygen. Can't breath? Sedate them, stick a tube down their throat and put them on a ventilator. Copious secretions? Aggressive suctioning. All the treatment is purely reactive to what the body is doing, until the body can ride it out and start winning the fight. Scary.",

The declaration also helps in persuading residents in infected countries to abide by health and hygiene recommendations. \n\n&gt;When WHO\u2019s Emergency Committee declares a PHEIC, it allows WHO to put travel advisories in place for cities, regions and countries, such as those used in outbreaks like the 2003 SARS epidemic. WHO also has the ability to review public health measures carried out by countries to ensure they are up to the proper health standards.\n\nEdit: just want to note that when I posted this, the article was basically two sentences without a lot of detail.",

They were looking at the world stage, and up until recently, it truly was a China-centric emergency. Essentially everyone who was sick had directly travelled to Wuhan beforehand, there was (and still is) zero deaths outside of China, near-zero cases of H2H spread in any international countries until recently, and international governments were all on board with properly containing the spread for afflicted patients in their country. There wasnt anything constituting an emergency on the overall world stage, simply just within China. Declaring an emergency would have just induced unnecessary panic at the time, and had the potential to \u2018devalue\u2019 the importance of a future emergency if this whole situation blew over.",

Not vague ones that can be moved about to your liking. The best thing to do is not make announcements based on a guessing game on how the virus will progress, but to actually make announcements when you know definitively what its current state is",

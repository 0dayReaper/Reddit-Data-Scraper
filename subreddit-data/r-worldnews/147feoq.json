He's delusional if he thinks all the homeless would be fed if this didn't happen. But let's not also exaggerate and think someone is going to invade Poland if this exercise didn't happen.

My whole post just said the US and NATO dont have to fear invasion at all, and to make the claim that we are under any threat of that is outlandish.\n\nNobody would ever invade a NATO country because the threat of nukes and complete annihilation, no matter how remote, is too great. That's the same reason Russia has no real fear of domestic invasion and why NATO forces haven't directly intervened in the Russia/Ukraine war outside of \"strong condemnation\" and arms supply.\n\nIt's also why Russia is scared of NATO expansion. They know that as soon as a country joins NATO, they can't do anything to them because they are scared of retaliation.",

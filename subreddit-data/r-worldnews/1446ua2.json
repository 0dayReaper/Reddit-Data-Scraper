The PNW dealt with horrific forest fires/smoke off and on for the past few years (at least the last 5 or so, can\u2019t remember exactly because\u2026 I don\u2019t want to and try to block the memories out). This issue in the Northeast US had truly made me appreciate our good air quality, like, I\u2019m so incredibly grateful to not be on the Eastern seaboard right now because I know how godawful the reality of what they\u2019re going through really is. The scratchy throat, the ashy saliva, and burning eyes even for someone who is healthy is absolutely hell. I feel so incredibly bad for them, and wish all who are affected well.\n\n2. I was able to pet the neighborhood orange cat this morning on my way to work and have been on a mini high ever since. He doesn\u2019t come out as much as he used to and he\u2019s the sweetest little feline being who demands pets from absolutely everyone (even trying, and usually succeeding, to stop the morning joggers for scritches).\n\nEdit: tried to fix the formatting",

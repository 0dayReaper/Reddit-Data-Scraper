[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The rhetoric for a while has been this will happen by July and I doubt the other NATO leaders would be signalling this if there was a risk of this blowing up on them. \n\nSo I agree if it gets shuttered now it's probably never going to happen. For both sides because clearly there's an issue that Turkey can't get past and I doubt there'd be much of an appetite from Sweden to put themselves out like this and be kinda embarrassed again. Plus with Finland in Sweden's only really exposed in Gotland so their security isn't nearly as threatened (similar to why some of those central European countries surrounded by NATO don't talk of joining).",

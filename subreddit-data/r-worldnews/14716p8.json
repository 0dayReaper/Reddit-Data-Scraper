So when a lighting strike happens and burns the forests, its killing dead old trees and allow seeds to open up from the heat and start the renewal of the forest. However a lot of fires are started by criminals.",

They wiped out over 24 MILLION hectares. \n\nImagine if all of Scotland was on fire all at once.\n\nDouble it.\n\nAnd then do it *again*.  \n\nThen add another million hectares.\n\nThat's how deadly Black Summer was. \n\nThe amount of biodiversity lost was absolutely devastating and has led to systemic ecologic collapse in areas that weren't touched by it as migratory animals have lost habitat along with literally thousands of species of flora, fungus and fauna that are now extinct.\n\nA burn of 60,000h is already utterly heartbreakingly massive and catastrophic for woodland density and habitat as well as animal lives lost and a billion other things.\n\nAll that is to say, it could be much, much worse, but with talented and committed people it can be stopped and recovered from.",

Let's hope for a speedy recovery and effective preventative measures going forward.",

The global South Anglicans stopped listening to Welby a long time ago, and just recently had a vote of no confidence in him and the other leadership bodies in the CoE. They are actively working to realign and build a global Anglican church apart from Canterbury over this and other issues.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; Justin Welby said there was no justification for supporting the legislation, in a move that highlights deep divisions within the global Anglican church on LGBTQ+ issues.\n\n&gt; Archbishop Stephen Kaziimba, the leader of the Ugandan church, praised the new law.\n\n&gt; In a statement, Welby said: &amp;quot;I am deeply aware of the history of colonial rule in Uganda, so heroically resisted by its people. But this is not about imposing western values on our Ugandan Anglican sisters and brothers. It is about reminding them of the commitments we have made as Anglicans to treat every person with the care and respect they deserve as children of God.&amp;quot;Within the Anglican communion we continue to disagree over matters of sexuality, but supporting such legislation is a fundamental departure from our commitment to uphold the freedom and dignity of all people.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1451gex/archbishop_of_canterbury_justin_welby_criticises/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688302 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Anglican**^#1 **church**^#2 **support**^#3 **people**^#4 **law**^#5",

Their only warm water port was in Crimea (hence why it's so important to them)\n\nThat means that as a Norwegian we grew up knowing that in the event of a third world war, Russia's main attack vector would always have to be immediately taking control of our coastline or risk their navy being blockaded into the north pole.\n\nShould the poles melt, the distance to the rest of the world for Russia would reduce from unreachable for 5 months, and half a world away for the rest to a few days away.",

The remaining fish are having trouble thriving and reproducing. They can survive current conditions, but they are struggling and aren't as successful at breeding. The young fish die because the temps and pH are so far out of range that there is less oxygen in the water and the young fish die. The polluters blame the fishers, the fishers blame the polluters, and nothing gets done.",

We need to teach low tech low energy solutions to basic life things. \n\nIt\u2019s unacceptable that people in first world countries use so much energy. For example, we don\u2019t even think about how much energy we drain by leaving electronics on all night unused. Or, what the price we are paying when we have a culture where everyone of us is keeping electronic devices, charged and at the ready all the time. \n\nEven more obvious is big chain stores should be held accountable for the trash they create, not allowed to use items that are one and done, etc.\nBig empty buildings need to have minimal lights on at night.\n\n\nThese are just a few simple things. But we so desperately need to think about everyone\u2019s impact. This is so bad. We need all hands on deck to minimize the suffering. \n\nApologize for the format, I\u2019m on my phone.",

It is not the company that decides how much it pays or where it goes, it is the law.\n\nThe government, after collecting the tax money, can use it for whatever it wants. It can go to protecting refuges, it can go to a universal basic income, it can go to R&amp;D on new energy sources...\n\nNow, the carbon tax that some countries have is currently not high enough. There also needs to be a carbon tariff, so that polluters don't outsource carbon emissions to countries without a tax. And the tax must cover the full social cost of carbon \u2013 basically, we can decide what to target and adjust that price accordingly. I think we should target reaching pre-industrial levels of atmospheric CO2 ASAP.\n\nBut for that we need an actual carbon tax, which many big economies don't have.",

Somewhere along the way people decided that scientists, the very style of minds that have repeatedly led us out from simple technology into bigger and better things, the minds that have literally shaped the world as we know it, weren\u2019t worth listening to when the scientific body realized it had gone too far. The people profiting off of the backs of great minds decided man simply needed to take on more of natures responsibility, and that scientists would figure it out as we went about consuming, burning, ripping, and stripping our land and resources. The ultra greedy cared for only big numbers which make them feel good, and to stop and listen to the very society of which the minds that we can attribute our life\u2019s pleasure to, would hurt big happy number. So instead scientists are mocked, funding is cut, they silence them, and when that doesn\u2019t work they rely on knee jerk distraction techniques that are more entertaining to a simple mind, than oh by the way we never had any right to try to replace Mother Nature, and now that we\u2019ve tried to for a couple hundred years the pay back is gonna be a bitch. Life will likely endure after a large amount of humanity, if not all, learn the lesson that the earth is THE ecosystem, not that there are separate unrelated ecosystems, and no. Man is not outside of nature.",

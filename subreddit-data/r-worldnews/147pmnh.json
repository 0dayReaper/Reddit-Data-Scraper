[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2.

She self-terminated her pregnancy at between 32-34 weeks, whilst saying she was below 10 weeks. \n\n&gt;The prosecution said the woman had knowingly misled BPAS by saying that she was below the 10-week cut-off, when she believed she was about 28 weeks pregnant. Doctors later concluded the foetus was between 32 and 34 weeks gestation at the time of delivery.",

Or was she in denial?\n\nEdit now I've actually read it: She had only moved back in with her ex for the sake of her kids, and didn't want him knowing she was pregnant. She possibly panicked and made a rash decision. She also stated that she thought she'd had a miscarriage earlier and her body hadn't adequately expelled it - if that had happened she would've already been dead from infection (although in rare cases it can lead to the fetus petrifying inutero) \n\nIn either case, apparently she's in mental health treatment, and getting nightmares of her baby's face. It doesn't seem like this was cold-blooded or heartless.",

She had initially been charged with \u2018intentional destruction of a viable unborn child\u2019, an offence under the 1929 Infant Life (Preservation) Act, when she appeared before North Staffordshire Magistrates Court in July 2022, but prosecutors later accepted a guilty plea to what they today described as a \u201cmore palatable\u201d alternative.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an abortion. She plead guilty to procuring an illegal abortion, she was not tried for murder, she was not found guilty of murder, the term \u201cmurder\u201d never appeared in any charges against her.",

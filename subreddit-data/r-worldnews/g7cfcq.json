It's well know that he doesn't pay for anything. *However*, Trump Corp hires on small companies to build his empire through subsidiary companies, with really vague names that don't make you think twice. So these small businesses take on jobs and then get fucked before they realize they've been had. Happens over and over and over, and of course they don't have the resources to successfully sue. It's fucking infuriating.",

If I'm all in on candidate \"x\", suddenly recognizing that he's a sleazeball feels kind of like admitting that I'm an idiot.  As long as someone can feed me some confirmation bias and tell me that all the news about candidate \"x\" is wrong, I can go ahead and preserve my pride by rejecting the bad (but true) news in favor of good (but false) news.",

Either the lead bank(s) lends the money, and then syndicates the loan out to dozens of banks, or a club of banks get together at the beginning and finance it. \n\nTrump does NOT owe Bank of China 30% of $950m. That would be if he borrowed directly from them. He has a partial stake in an asset that has a $950m loan on it. That\u2019s very different. If you owned shares in Tesla, even as a tiny holder, would you say you owe money to Tesla\u2019s creditors?\n\n\nedit: Trump absolutely should\u2019ve put his assets in a blind trust, and frankly I\u2019m hoping he is voted out in Nov. But you can\u2019t make a mountain out of every single molehill, otherwise the next real mountain doesn\u2019t get taken seriously.",

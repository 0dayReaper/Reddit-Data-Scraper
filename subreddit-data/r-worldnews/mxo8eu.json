I remember talking to him about Iraq one day \"I don't care as long as it's not in my backyard\" is what he said. He said if you heard the flying fortresses over head and no explosions it meant you were having a good day. He wasn't patriotic about the war, like many other people he was just surviving it.",

Roughly half the members of the Japanese parliament are members of the Nippon Kaigi which takes up the \"Japan did nothing wrong\" revisionist view of WWII. The last ~~three~~ two (and one in the late 2000s aside from Abe) prime ministers (and the majority of their cabinets) have all been part of it as well.\n\nEdit: I completely forgot that the Democratic Party existed and that they had power for a few years in there.",

Northern States were the accepted States that if a slave ran away and made it to, they'd be free. Then the South usurped \"State's Rights\" with that vile Fugitive Slave Act, meaning Southerners were free to roam the North and recapture slaves. That extended the Underground Railroad to Canda to finally get the escapees to real freedom.\n\nI wonder how many African-Americans from the North were snatched by those vile people as a \"close enough\" if they couldn't find \"their\" slave. Makes you want to spit in disgust.\n\nI know we're both on the same side of the ridiculousness of \"State's Rights\", it's just the sheer audacity to claim it wasn't about owning humans as property. Every single declaration of Succession proclaimed it loud and \"proud\" about defending the institution of slavery. The Confederate Vice President even declared that it was about \"restoring the natural and proper order of society\".  He even stated that the Confederate Constitution was the be the opposite of the US Constitution. Men were not created equal, women were not equal to men, and African-Americans inequal to the whites.\n\nI'm sorry I went on a rant, but I don't often see the mention of the rebel vice president's declaration of inequality being a fact of nature nor the mention that they styled their constitution to be directly opposed to ours.\n\nThe hypocricy was already bad enough, Land of the Free, owning humans as property. But then said owners seceding to protect owning humans. And now the South wants to hastily cover up their own revered founders direct statements!\n\nWar of Northern Agression my ass, they fired the first goddamn shots!",

The people they were raised by \u2018ore often than not\n\nEdit: corrected the name of the articles in question. Thanks ya\u2019ll for the keen eye",

I fully agree with you, we need to know all of this information.  But I'm also pointing out that just because we were on the allies side, doesn't mean we were squeaky clean.  Nor are we taught this information in school.  I never heard of them till listening to Dan Carlin's podcast on Japan's history from right before WW1 onwards.",

            "comment": "So, there are questions in this thread and in others about why this genocide was recognized so late and why other similar genocides have yet to be recognized by the United States. As a lawyer working in international law, I wrote what I hope to be at least a partial answer. Unfortunately, the history is fairly complicated and generally poorly explained by news articles. **TL;DR**: The answer is two-fold, and explains why all countries are hesitant to declare certain actions genocide even within countries otherwise unimportant to their foreign policy. First, a declaration of genocide obliges the declarant to act to stop the genocide. Second, and most remarkable in the current case, the declaration forever helps define what the declaring country considers genocide.\n\n\nIn any case, and for the record, this declaration reflects the settled legal reality that this genocide absolutely and legally was a genocide.\n\n\n***First: The Erga Omnes Obligation***\n\n\nTo understand the first prong, it is necessary to understand the legal concept of *erga omnes*. An *erga omnes* obligation is an obligation that all countries owe to each other and to the world, and is a label generally ascribed to the most important obligations (called *jus cogens*) which the prevention of genocide is. It gives any country in the world standing in an international court when a violation of an *erga omnes* obligation occurs and another country does not stop it. It therefore gives all states the rights to invoke state responsibility for the other country\u2019s failure to contain the genocide (very basically, state responsibility is similar to paying damages, *see* the ILC\u2019s report on state responsibility, linked below). This means that states that do not perform their *erga omnes* obligation when it is their universal responsibility to do so open themselves up to claims internationally. *Erga Omnes* obligations were recognized by the International Court of Justice in [*Barcelona Traction*](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/50/050-19700205-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf) at para 33:\n\n\n&gt; When a State admits into its territory foreign investments or foreign nationals, whether natural or juristic persons, it is bound to extend to them the protection of the law and assumes obligations concerning the treatment to be afforded them. These obligations, however, are neither absolute nor unqualified. In particular, an essential distinction should be drawn between the obligations of a State towards the international community as a whole, and those arising vis-\u00e0-vis another State in the field of diplomatic protection. By their very nature the former are the concern of all States. In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations *erga omnes*.\n\n\nThe prevention of genocide as *erga omnes* was recognized by the International Law Commission of the United Nations through it\u2019s [*Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf) at page 111 where it states:\n\n\n&gt; essential distinction should be drawn between the obligations of a State towards the international community as a whole, and those arising vis-\u00e0-vis another State in the field of diplomatic protection. By their very nature the former are the concern of all States. In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations erga omnes\u2026  At the preliminary objections stage of the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide case, it stated that \u201cthe rights and obligations enshrined by the [Genocide] Convention are rights and obligations erga omnes\u201d this finding contributed to its conclusion that its temporal jurisdiction over the claim was not limited to the time after which the parties became bound by the Convention.\n\n\nThe idea that genocide is an obligation *erga omnes* formally brought into law in the 1996 [*Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia*](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/91/091-19960711-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf) PMO decision when the court, through an analysis of the purpose of the *Genocide Convention* found the prevention of genocide to be an obligation *erga omnes*. That said, in paragraph 31, it said something very interesting: \n\n\n&gt; \"The origins of the Convention show that it was the intention of the United Nations to condemn and punish genocide as 'a crime under international law' involving a denial of the right of existence of entire human groups, a denial which shocks the conscience of mankind and results in great losses to humanity, and which is contrary to moral law and to the spirit and aims of the United Nations. The first consequence arising from this conception is that the principles underlying the Convention are principles which are recognized by civilized nations as binding on States, even without any conventional obligation. A second consequence is the universal character both of the condemnation of genocide and of the CO-operation required 'in order to liberate mankind from such an odious scourge' (Preamble to the Convention).\" It follows that the rights and obligations enshrined by the Convention are rights and obligations erga omnes. ***The Court notes that the obligation each State thus has to prevent and to punish the crime of genocide is not territorially limited by the Convention.*** [emphasis added]\n\n\nThis was made even more explicit in the [*The Gambia v. Myanmar*](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/178/178-20200123-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf) where the court said at para 41:\n\n\n&gt; The Court held that these provisions generated \u201cobligations [which] may be defined as \u2018obligations erga omnes partes\u2019 in the sense that each State party has an interest in compliance with them in any given case\u201d (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II), p. 449, para. 68). It follows that any State party to the Genocide Convention, and not only a specially affected State, **may invoke the responsibility of another State party with a view to ascertaining the alleged failure to  comply with its obligations erga omnes partes, and to bring that failure to an end.** [emphasis added]\n\n\nThe parts that I have emphasized are a formal recognition that each state has an actual obligation to do something to prevent genocide in the case that an occurrence of e genocide exists, and as it is an *erga omnes* obligation, a state that recognizes a genocide, is in a position to help stop that genocide, but refuses to do so, has breached its *erga omnes* obligations and other states may invoke state responsibility over them for their failure to act. That is one of a few major reasons that states are hesitant to recognize genocides; **they may be bound to act to stop that genocide if they so declare one.**\n\n\n***Second: the Application of the Genocide Convention***\n\n\nOne of the most important instruments in international law is the [*Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf). This treaty under Article 31(3)(b) on the general principles of interpretation states: \n\n\n&gt; 3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context: (b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\n\n\nThe [*Genocide Convention*](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf) under Article II states: \n\n\n&gt; In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:\n&gt; (a) Killing members of the group;\n&gt; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;\n&gt; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;\n&gt; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;\n&gt; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\n\nThe essence of these clauses is that the treatment of Genocide under the Genocide Convention compounds in on itself. While genocide is defined, there is not currently a list of actual specific actions undertaken by states that constitute genocide, which would be extremely helpful because according to the article you have to prove that the there was *intent* to destroy the group, which is based on actions and statements (there are many cases that speak to this requirement).\n\n\nIf the global community generally considers something to be genocide, then that thing that it considers genocide will gradually become indicative of the crime of genocide. Thus, countries risk creating legal situation where genocide becomes what they have declared it to be. While that sounds great, it also risks having the crime of genocide become meaningless as countries are willing to declare it whenever they suspect it, and thus gradually bring the net of behaviour that the genocide convention catches wider. The reason that this is a bad thing is that, as mentioned genocide\u2019s *erga omnes* status is extremely serious and obliges states to act. A loose genocide definition actually makes the world *less* stable and makes states *worse* at preventing that genocide as genocide begins to mean less. Again, this comment is **not** meant to defend any country that shrinks away from its responsibilities.\n\n\nIn sum, international law makes the declaration of genocide a lot harder than base concerns about diplomacy (which absolutely still exist) and is actually much more complicated than people realize.",

I did not go for an additional paragraph on *jus cogens* mainly because I did not have space and because as it is also an *erga omnes* obligation it allows any state to invoke state responsibility which is the core concern of states who invoke claims of genocide. While art. 42 speaks of all states being responsible for acts that they have the collective duty to prevent, those are referring to *erga omnes* obligations, which all *jus cogens* obligations are. Basically an obligation can stem from the law being *jus cogens* but *erga omnes* does not by itself create an obligation, rather it defines a particular type of obligation. And you are absolutely correct that the actual violation of international law itself stems from it being a *jus cogens* norm regardless of whether a state has signed the Convention. The big problem with this is that the *jus cogens* norm is informed completely by the Convention and through practice due to the \"*opinio juris* + practice\" formula for customary international law and the VCLT. If that was not clear in what I wrote that is totally my bad.",

For instance, Mexico has a monist constitution that brings international law directly into its domestic law. Additionally, in states with dualist constitutions (i.e. the United States) nearly all modern international instruments require domestic legal implementation in order to be considered ratified. That means that nearly every modern treaty that the United States has signed has been incorporated into its domestic law, but not many people practice these kinds of law so not many people know that. There are even elements of the Geneva Conventions brought directly into the American ROEs. The United States has over 100 laws that are in place specifically to make sure your domestic courts can enforce your international obligations.\n\nI think the best examples would be your USITC which is empowered by the domesticating legislation signed pursuant to the WTO suite of international treaties, as well as your [*Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Award*]( https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9/chapter-2) which upholds the *New York Convention* which is one of the most signed international treaties in the world. \n\n\nThis latter convention would make it so that if a valid cause of action was arbitrated against the United States for failing to adhere to its legal obligations, US courts may mandate a payout in certain circumstances. This would of course, be exceptionally rare in the case of something like genocide and is legally untested, but the possibility remains a risk. The New York Convention actually sees fantastic adherence in the United States and around the world. This convention is also why online sites and games have international arbitration clauses; because they are satisfied they will be able to get judgement everywhere because so many countries have similar domesticating legislation.\n\n\nFor a broader discussion of international law as a social contract outside of domestic law, see the replies to this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/h8jtst/us_navy_deploys_three_aircraft_carriers_to/fuxdvb6/",

In the current case the super-delayed declaration was due to political concerns, but generally if a state doesn't want to do anything to intervene it will state that its official position at the time was that the genocide was not in fact a genocide in its opinion. The second prong is a state overtly stating that something is a genocide will necessarily be used as evidence against it later when it does not respond to an identical situation.",

I am simply saying in general he seems to be *trying* to do the most good he can, from his admittedly outdated perspective. He is absolutely not perfect, but I believe he has a genuine capacity to empathize at all so at least there's that. Like, literally at all.... Again, unlike 45.",

Driven forward by paramilitary escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to robbery, rape, and massacre. In the Syrian Desert, they were dispersed into a series of concentration camps; in early 1916 another wave of massacres were ordered, leaving about 200,000 deportees alive by the end of 1916. Around 100,000 to 200,000 Armenian women and children were forcibly converted to Islam and integrated into Muslim households. Massacres and ethnic cleansing of Armenian survivors were carried out by the Turkish nationalist movement during the Turkish War of Independence after World War I.\n\n&gt;The Armenian Genocide resulted in the destruction of more than two millennia of Armenian civilization in eastern Asia Minor. With the destruction and expulsion of Syriac and Greek Orthodox Christians, it enabled the creation of an ethno-national Turkish state. Prior to World War II, the Armenian Genocide was widely considered the greatest atrocity in history. As of 2021, 30 countries, including the United States, have recognized the events as genocide. Against the academic consensus, Turkey denies that the deportation of Armenians was a genocide or wrongful act.",

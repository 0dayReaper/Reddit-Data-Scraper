Maksimishin was a deputy chief physician of the hospital, where this ambulance belonged to and where Navalny was transported to after the poisoning.\n\nChief physician Murakhovsky did his best to prevent treatment of Navalny and did everything to interfere with transportation of Navalny for treatment in Germany. The role of the deputy chief physician in this story is unclear.\n\nEDIT: Maksimishin was the head of the intensive care unit that during the first minutes correctly put Navalny into medical coma and started artificial ventilation of lungs. He participated in rescuing of Navalny.",

The first bomb threat call came five minutes after the commander of Flight 2614 requested an emergency landing. Then ambulance came in about 10 minutes after landing, which was rather fast.",

For an emergency landing they have a different place at the airport for an ambulance and stuff.\n\nThe real luck is Navalny's last words \"I was poisoned and I'm dying\" before he passed out. Plus he starts to scream very loud, so crew couldn't just ignore him. This is why emergency landing was performed, and this is why atropine has been administrated.",

They are bad, but the V series are worse. The danger of Novichok agents are that they are easily concealed as a set of relatively harmless chemicals prior to making the actual agent.\n\nEdit: Since this is getting attention I just want to clarify a couple of things. Remember there are MANY Novichok agents and only a handful of declassified scientific studies on a few of them. There may very well be more dangerous ones out there that are still held in secret. The studies available to the public (at least the ones that I have read) do not support the claim that Novichoks are much more deadly than the V series agents. At best Novichoks have showed similar toxicity and at worst lower toxicity than the most deadly of the V series organophosphorus nerve agents.",

These things are pretty nasty, which is why you see farmers wearing protective suits and gas masks when spraying certain pesticides.

You're fired.\n\nIt didn't seem like a planned-out strategy with a particular direction in mind, but it was remarkably effective at winnowing down the people around him until only the sycophants and people keeping their heads down remained.\n\nAbsolute dictators like to do the same thing, except with lethal force at their disposal. Anyone who isn't slavishly loyal for a brief moment can be purged. Everyone around the dictator learns to demonstrate their loyalty without prompting so that they won't be made into the next example.",

However, this backfired on Lenin in a big way; what the post lacked in nominal power, it made up for in practical power. Stalin quickly realized that he had the power to reward supporters by giving them key government positions, and he also maintained the Party's membership records \u2014 i.e. kept tabs on everyone. By the time everyone realized what was happening, Lenin had died and it was too late to stop Stalin. Thanks to Stalin, even after his death it was the General Secretary who was the real leader of the USSR, not the Premier (who may have been, but usually wasn't, the same person). Stalin would ironically end up doing this to people he wanted to get rid of (when he wasn't liquidating them outright) \u2014 NKVD chief Nikolai Yezhov, when seen as a threat to Stalin's power, was punted off to run river transportation, while his first deputy, Frinovsky, was put in charge of the Navy.\n\n-TvTropes, [Kicked Upstairs](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs)",

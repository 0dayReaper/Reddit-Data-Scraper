What is happening is that with all the attention focused on the Amazon, cattle farmers are looking other ways to expand farming lands. \n\nWhile the Brazilian government doesn't focus on actually punishing the cattle industry for deforestation, this will continue one way or another. \n\nIt is hard, since the heads of this industry are as strong as the heads of the gun industry on the USA.\n\nEdit to add: The deforestation is not for wood and it is not done by common people. It is 99% done by cattle farmers to create grasslands for cattle to roam. This a-holes have a strong presence in politics and are the main responsibles for the deaths of many indigenous people and environmental activists.",

Sure, the government will bail the meat industry out maybe a couple of times, but soon it\u2019ll actually affect things. \n\nBy just claiming we need structural changes, you are, in fact throwing your hands up and acting like there is nothing you can do. Sure, we need those changes, but those changes won\u2019t happen as long as demand is high.",

If we could take all the subsidies given to the animal products industry and gave them to the meat alternatives (lab meat, plant \"meat\", dairy alternatives, etc.) many people who don't currently care enough about the environment would instantly make the switch merely because it's cheaper.\n\nThis includes myself. Food prices have risen dramatically recently, and my pay hasn't. So while I would certainly prefer to switch everything I buy, I can't afford it. Currently I'll grab the organic, non-meat, etc. version if it's not much more expensive, but oat milk, for example, was something like four times the price of dairy milk last time I looked.",

If we shifted toward chicken and away from beef/pork, that alone would be a massive victory for environmentalism.\n\nAnd someday, hopefully soon, lab grown meat can deliver the same food experience people are after at a fraction of the environmental cost. One step at a time. And it would take power away from bad faith actors like these cattle industry assholes.",

However, when you see his own party voting for the deforestation of one of the largest forests in the world, it is kinda hard to stand by him as well.\n\nEdit: lol I am pointing out facts and still get downvoted. That's enough to tell you that Lula's supporters ain't willing to criticise him when he needs to, just like Bolsonaro's supporters.",

Yeah i don't know how to fix that :/",

Stores here in Japan instituted a \"one per customer\" policy really early on, but the shelves are still empty of toilet paper, tissues, and masks, and you still see big lines of people before stores open hoping to get some toilet paper or masks.  \n  \nDon't get me wrong, it's still a good idea. If you're a store owner, you only get 50 of a product in stock, you limit purchases to one per customer, and 100 people want that product, that means 50 will get it and 50 will go home empty handed. If you *don't* limit purchases, that means 9 regular customers will get it, 1 scalper will snatch up all the rest, and 90 will go home empty handed. So limiting it to one-product-per-customer *is a good thing*, but, experience shows, that doesn't necessary eliminate fucking lines and the inability to buy products.",

I think I can help here.  \n\n&gt; I mean we have these sophisticated POS machines that I am 99% certain are tracking what we buy (if only to collect and sell our data or target us with custom advertising) and I am 99% certain that their stocks are also kept track of with computers. \n\nThe POS machines (registers) in the store can vary from dumb terminals to high-end PC's running the latest Windows (God help them). Stores like Hobby Lobby are really only a few steps over a simple calculator. While stores like Home Depot and Best Buy run extremely sophisticated systems. Most retailers primarily use POS to track what is purchased for replenishment purposes. Secondly would be customer trends and they are generally happy to find a trend at the store level and not the customer level. \n\n&gt; So why the hell aren't these linked? Why the hell aren't the POS computers going \"OH hey it looks like you're buying out our entire stock of \\[product\\] - I'm not going to allow that because it'll fuck up our stock\" \n\nExcellent question. This would require a real-time call to an inventory system. And most store inventory systems are centralized now (ie. not on a server in the store). Calls across the WAN are expensive both monetarily and resource-wise. Store systems are very particular about when, why, and what is being sent over the wire. Let's say the real-time inventory call is made and the response is that the store is out of that product. But the customer has one in their hand and inventory systems are notoriously inaccurate. Do you sell the product that you supposedly don't have? Hell yes, you do. \n\n&gt; Or at the very least they can go \"Oh Customer \\[#39182\\] is buying 8 packs of \\[product\\], let's pause their POS and get a manager to OK this transaction\". *OR* it can go \"OH hey, you're the 12th customer to buy excessive amounts of \\[product\\] today, stock system tells me that's dangerous, maybe I should flag all future purchases of \\[product\\] over # units?\" \n\nSome of these most modern POS systems can already do and some they can't. The trick here is that any change to a store's POS system, no matter how small, has to go through extensive testing. So, let's say I have a simple configuration that says buying more than 8 packs of TP requires manager approval. The process to get that change approved, made, tested, and pushed to production is lengthy by design. Retailers do not want to be able to make changes to their POS systems easily because that's how things break.   \n\n&gt;We're supposed to live in a technologically advanced society, so why the hell isn't this technology being used to control our stupidity and keep businesses functioning normally? \n\nBecause our stupidity is profitable. \n\nAlso, in the 80's and 90's the US was more advanced in retail tech than the rest of the world. Since then we have fallen far behind. US retailers' priorities are only now starting to be about user experience. The world ends every quarter, month, day, etc. from a financial standpoint for the Executives.",

Starting with toilet paper and escalating to everything else non-perishable.  I'm really fed up with it atm, as I can't get tons of things I need and we've had to modify what we eat considerably.  \n\nI totally agree with the PM on this. Hoarders are both stupid and selfish.  There is nothing wrong with the production pathways at present.  They are creating a situation where people have to go out a lot  more frequently than usual to shop, exposing them to infection opportunities, increased costs, depriving our most vunerable people of things they need and generally inconveniencing everybody.\n\nEdit: Still think he's a twit though.",

I can understand the financial situation must be hard given the circumstances but so far it seems everything by the government appears to be reactionary. Its quite ironic for him to say this when he literally left the country to come back when the fire has stopped\n\nGive me ma boi KRudd back, his policy decisions saved much of Australia in 08. Hopefully the government makes the right decisions here else the fallout will be much more severe than people expect it to be as mentioned by u/azthal",

Aren't they the only ones guaranteed to continue getting their steady income because it's a set amount of government benefits? Shouldn't financial aid be going to sole traders or small businesses that will fail if they're forced to shut down for 6 months?",

Angela Merkel once gave an [interview](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/28/angela-merkel-stockpiling-food-east-germany) in which she said that she still has a habit of stockpiling as a result of growing up in Eastern Germany.\n\nHaving a different economic system doesn't magically make people less selfish or greedy.",

Or is this just what it looks like when everyone at once has to suddenly stock up their pantry for a whole month rather than buying their groceries on an \u201cas needed, just-in-time\u201d basis every day or every few days?\n\nI mean, I\u2019ve always been told that \u201cadulting\u201d looks like having a thorough grocery list and a full pantry of essentials and only grocery shopping every few weeks. Hasn\u2019t stopped most of my peers from basically buying food on a meal-by-meal basis several times a week.\n\nI feel like \u201choarding\u201d is sort of a moral panic. Like there\u2019s a few notable cases, but everyone\u2019s getting self-righteous about something that\u2019s actually not happening that much. I think it\u2019s just what it looks like when everyone starts doing what we were \u201csupposed to be\u201d doing all along, which is keeping more than just two or three days of food at our house.\n\nEven limiting items to one per customer isn\u2019t going to help when you keep 100 in stock expecting to sell maybe 5 a day...and suddenly 1000 people all want it. Even if they each only want 1...you\u2019re going to have shortages. This isn\u2019t people \u201choarding,\u201d though. It\u2019s just a lot of people wanting something at the same time.\n\nLook, it will subside. People are stocking up now, but won\u2019t do so forever. Once you\u2019re stocked up...you don\u2019t go back out until your stockpile runs low...which I thought is sort of the whole point of this social distancing thing? Sure it may be a bit crazy and inconvenient now...but it sort of is a good sign to me. It means people really are planning to stay in their house for a month or two. It will minimize people going to the store over the next month or two when the lockdown really sets in.",

I explained how the discontinuation of grocery delivery services is impacting those that cannot go to the stores themselves. He literally argued \"public v private divide\" to me, someone with multiple degrees in politics and policy, to which I asked \"who is leading who?\" He thanked me for my concerns, wished me the best living with a disability during the crisis, gave me numbers for charities (as in NGOs), and hung up.\n\nSo Australian (bureaucratic) behaviour is ironically - handballing. Handballing problems, blaming someone else. Predictable. \n\nI'm still in disbelief this person had time for my call, honestly.\n\nBackground: I have a disability that inhibits me from leaving the house and because of medication and illness I also cannot drive. So, I rely on grocery delivery which has been cancelled indefinitely by Coles (Woolworths way too overpriced for my income). The Coles policy says only those \"vulnerable\" will receive delivery still but didn't specify what qualified as \"vulnerable\" and when I tried to call them, the line automatically hangs up at 38 minutes. I rely on this service because there are those more in need for services like Meals on Wheels.",

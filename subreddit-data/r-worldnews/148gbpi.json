I was born in Kharkiv and I was 6 when it happened, so most of this was told to me by my parents. They were camping near the Saltov reservoir that became sorta famous last year during the Ukrainian counteroffensive. They got caught in an absolute downpour and all their stuff was soaked. \n\nWhen they got back, news about the disaster slowly started to trickle out to the general Soviet population. People in the West knew about what happened several days, if not weeks before the average person in the USSR. My parents and their friends connected the dots and had an Oh Shit moment. One of their friends was a physics professor in one of the Kharkiv universities and had access to a Geiger Counter. All of their clothing and gear was off the scale because the rain was contaminated. They ended up disposing of everything, which was a big deal because camping gear was very difficult to get. \n\nThankfully, there are no health complications for anyone. But I do have a good friend who grew up in Gomel, which was one of the most contaminated cities, and has to get constant biopsies for any skin issues.",

When the news came out, Armed Forces Network was showing maps of fallout in Europe due to this. A large plume was over our area. At that time, the news (and the Army) said basically \"Stay indoors the next few days until this passes.\"\n\nSo it was rather terrifying to find out we had been playing in an area with higher than normal radiation for two days. Our area wasn't exposed to a lot, but it was more than normal background radiation.\n\nOur brother died of a rare type of leukemia that we have no family history of years later. We wonder if it was caused by that, but of course will never know.\n\nOnce the military news (and the Army) said it was at least safer to resume our normal lives, we did. But for several days, I remember Mom insisted we play inside.",

There are a lot of nasty ways to die; and honestly, if you're reading this and you don't know, the less you learn about acute radiation poisoning the better.\n\nIt was really good and I do want to see the rest, but imagine how pitching the show to my partner went, based on that experience of seeing an episode.",

Language classes give you the basics, but attaining working proficiency or fluency is very much something that happens in front of your computer screen and television if you don't have access to native speakers in your everyday life. American and English TV shows, with subtitles at first, helped tremendously.\n\nIt's so difficult to learn a new language when you don't have a strong incentive to do so. I don't know if I would've bothered with other languages if I lived in the US and spoke the lingua franca natively.",

In the second round, people who don't really like the more reasonable candidate tend to vote for him or her anyway, just to show their opposition to the candidate from the party with the extreme views.\n\nThis is how Jacques Chirac (mainstream right) was elected with 82.21% of the vote in the 2002 Presidential election compared to the 19.88% that qualified him for the second round.\n\nWhat's concerning however is that the far right has been closing the gap with each new election. In the second round of the 2022 Presidential election, Le Pen still managed to federate 41.45% of the vote.\n\nA far right party winning the Presidential election would be a major upset in French politics. The National Rally might finish first in the first round in a future election though and that's concerning enough.",

My grandmother (who is in her 80s and lives in a retirement community in conservative Texas) had one of her neighbors rant at her about \"wok\" culture (\"woke culture\" I guess). They're literally angry about things they can't explain. Its different and thats bad! AHHHHHH! The liberals must be ruining America again. Its frustrating. These people vote, every single election. \n\nOur two party system means a lot of conservative voters who also oppose Donald Trump don't have a party to vote for, or a candidate to support. All Donald Trump needs is a plurality of Republican primary voters to become president. At no point in Donald Trump's political career has he ever been very popular, at best he could briefly hold a 50% approval rating, and he did not have a majority of votes in the primary. My grandfather left his ballot blank in 2016. I suspect a lot of people like him helped contribute to Trumps win: depressed voter turnout in 2016 meant Hilary didn't get the support she needed to beat Trump. \n\nTrump has created a dedicated cult of personality and his antics make for very entertaining reality TV for a lot of people. The combination means that Trump is absolutely adored by the media, even if they only love to hate him. The media was absolutely depressed that Trump lost his election and got banned from twitter. There was a good solid 6 months of quiet from the political news and you could tell a lot of the Media just didn't know what to do with \"boring, normal\" Biden after Trump spent the last 4 years twitter insanity at random hours of the morning. This kind of stuff contributes to his popularity. Simply him being in the news helps him be popular and helps his cult feel empowered.",

It's not at all surprising that our old constitutional \"code\" will have some bugs in it.  The only other modern democracy with anything close to the same level of buggy legacy \"code\" is the U.K.  And clearly they are suffering from their own sorts of problems.\n\nModern Civic Democracy requires regular updates.  Old systems may seem fair and just and robust at the time, but times change.  America in particular seems to be reluctant to give up on their old systems, even after they have proven to be exploitable.",

We're just asking...\"\n\nRight now I have gotten at least 5 updates on how the western tanks are loosing in Ukraine, and the right wingers are all over fb convincing boomers that supporting Ukraine was a waste of money.\n\nHow can we fight misinformation when the mainstream media is fueling the propaganda with their clickbait and fake headlines?\n\nAt LEAST our state sponsored news channel decided to completely block comments on their fb page, and I wish all news stations would follow up.\n\nI don't care of the far-right is jerking each other of in private groups.

Thankfully, foreign adversaries are like addicts in how they target vulnerabilities in our political systems. When Russia targeted Bernie Sanders supporters by pushing a narrative that the DNC was unduly interfering with his campaign, it resonated with populists. The overlap between populists and people sympathetic with some elements of fascism is how they appeal to low information voters. Most independents are not so independent and has been trending towards identity politics where independents view themselves as being above the fray and often, signal virtue that they eschew \"political correctness\". Again, these platforms are in lockstep with the domestic policies of Russia and other countries that are fascist friendly (Brazil, Turkey, Hungary, Philippines under Duteurte, Italy under Berlusconi,  India under Modi, Saudi Arabia, Israel under Netanyahu, etc). They're like a bloc. They all pretty much act in lockstep with each other because the consolidated capital that bankrolls them are too dumb to realize that the same big data tools they use to perpetuate it can be used to figure out who is responsible lol. \n\nDo you get your news from randos on Facebook? Other than getting a glimpse into their perspective and how the throes of media manipulation affects low information voters, don't. When it comes to info about war time and dynamics involving political conflict, prioritize official statements from countries/and agencies and use editorials and the work of investigative journalists and NGOs to color between the lines.",

Their relative incompetence in Ukraine suggests they had help in their disinformation campaigns. Their poor OPSEC that their assassins had throughout Europe (Bellingcat was able to use OSINT data to track them lol) helps to demonstrate that Russia wasn't the powerhouse in the US and that it likely points to a consortium of actors and sympathizers within the US.",

But bots shouldn't be able to make regular, for lack of a better word, social media accounts.\n\nI have no idea how to make that work, or if it's really even possible, but this is key.\n\nWe also need to expand education on critical thinking.

That standard is good enough to regulate the mass broadcast of porn, and it could be good enough to regulate mass broadcasting of bad faith propaganda whose primary purpose is to inflame hatred and promote division in what would otherwise be a stable and successful society. \n\nAnd yes, to reiterate, it would be very difficult to define and enforce in a perfectly fair and consistent way, but we have courts and a good legal system, and the only way to get better would be to start somewhere and iterate, build up precedents, and get practice.

This is not going to go away and until we learn how to regulate it, every nation with a rivalry is going to do this to one another. \n\nIf Russia disappeared today, China, the US, India and any given ideology with a budget and a clear agenda is going to inject this chaos for decades to come. I don't have a clear solution. Misinformation has been too well refined. We could mandate media outlets report \"in good faith,\" but that's vague enough to be useless (and corrupted) long term. A free press is an essential tool for democracy, but most developed nations put limits on free speech, if only for the obvious situations like \"fire in a public theater.\" Just so, we've invented a way for people from foreign countries to shout fire in other nations theaters: how do you control for that without limiting your own press beyond reason?",

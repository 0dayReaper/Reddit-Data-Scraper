The exports have included assault rifles, sniper rifles and other guns. Licences have also covered around \u00a32m in security goods such as riot shields.\n\n&gt;The government\u2019s own licensing criteria says that exports should not be granted if there is a \u201cclear risk that items might be used for internal repression\u201d. The government has the power to urgently review licences where situations change.\n\nHow much of this export is actually made in Scotland?",

You get to stand in a small concrete room with half a dozen of your squad in a circle while the instructor lights a tray of CS pellets. Once the room is pea soup with gas, the instructor tells you to remove your gas mask and shout out your name, rank and number. When he sees that you are sufficiently gassed - which is basically within the first two or three breaths - he will push you out the door, slam it shut and move on to the next recruit. Most manage to walk a few paces before collapsing into a coughing heap of snot and tears, but a few need to be dragged out. \n\nStill stands as one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life. The body does strange involuntary things when you breath that poison in. Your airway seems to open up, forcing more gas into your lungs, and your nose, eyes and salivary glands start hosing. I started hopping up and down and made a noise like a donkey being choked, and my brain just went into standby mode. I'm still surprised I didn't shit my pants tbh.",

I would say that CS chamber is more painful initially, but it subsides quickly.  The fact that it is in a small contained chamber is considerably worse than it would be for the people who are rioting.  But I would rather be gassed instead of suffering through OC spray again.\n\nI would say though depending on how worried everyone is about the coronavirus, gassing a crowd of people with CS gas or spray could be incredibly dangerous to everyone else that comes into close proximity with them.\n\nAll of the affected persons are going to be snoting, coughing.  With very little regard for where any of those droplets go.\n\nThank you all for your service.",

It's worth remembering that with the SNP and Greens, both for independence, holding a majority in Holyrood, there is a vested interest in doing this kinds of votes. I agree with their sentiment, I do, but they are nationalists with a very specific goal in mind regarding Westminister. Big showy votes like this are a feature of living in Scotland, but they are largely just for show.\n\nEdit: ok, at best it indicates the mood of the parliament at that time, but remember, this passed with 52 votes for/11 absented, less than half of parliament, or even less than the 67 MSPs the SNP and Greens have. It was an easy, low attendance vote with no binding that would always be received favourably. It is a show.",

I'm seriously concerned that too many people are swallowing the PR uncritically and becoming blind to problems we share with our neighbours. Hopefully that goes some way to explaining my concerns about this, because I see too many subscribing to exceptionalism that blinds us to many of the problems we still have in abundance.\n\nIt is a double edged sword, I agree. I just hope people recognise that we have to keep an eye on what the government does, not just the nice words it says, and to not forget the many problems we still have as a society, that we are not, perhaps, as far along as we might believe we are.",

It's like when municipal governments declare solidarity with some oppressed group in a foreign country, only the Scottish government is more meaningful because of their stronger political position.",

I do think that people could often say 'they don't represent me/us', and they'd be right, but in the grand scheme we've had a Scottish prime minister not so long ago too. \n\nOn the other hand, if you'd rather take the plunge then that's your choice too. I see no reason why Scotland wouldn't do at least as well as any other developed nation.\n\nI'd just (personally) like it if we can somehow find a way to make it work as a collective.

The foreign designer of the hardware is perfectly happy to get the license fees, but because the nation where the designer is based also wants to be able to have jobs for their people, the license agreement often includes provisions requiring the US to buy certain other hardware from that designer or another one in the country. It's pretty standard trade stuff.",

                            "comment": "WW2 has really poisoned our view of what a war is.  It's one of the few wars in history between large powers that seems to have worked out as almost a story book good vs bad. I know I'm being simplistic and it was really only in hindsight when we found out the true horror's of what went on in Germany,  but all war's are very complicated and even our current view of WW1 wasn't a simple case, but we seem to view it through the same lens we view WW2.\n\nOur cultural expectations of all wars since can still be manipulated into this simplistic world view of the righteous vs the non righteous. This has been a trope throughout history of course, but WW2 re-solidified that message into the cultural consciousness of the masses, that can be manipulated by the governments and powers that perpetuate them, that wars are some kind of simple good vs bad state of affairs which they never are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit:  I Just want to add a separate point on here that what the horrors of WW2 are not often understood as, is that they are the CULMINATION of European (white, incl. US) savagery. It wasn't just out of the blue like...'oh those Germans with their insane ideas'.   European white supremacism had been building and building and Germany....just saw it through to it's inevitable awful murderous conclusion which is a horrible thought really.  I believe that if it hadn't been Germany then, it would have been one of the other powers another time.. France in Algeria, the UK in India or Kenya etc.  I might be wrong in that though.\n\nNone of us (European/white powers) are innocent for that WW2 genocide. France, Spain, Belgium, England, the US had ALL been at it pretty hardcore up until WW2 and had murdered and displaced millions and millions of people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think of it like 5 or 6 friends came up with the same idea and were going around the town, beating and raping and killing and stealing from everyone. But then one of the friends really let loose and beat and raped and killed EVEN MORE than the other friends BUT much much closer to home and those other friends grouped together and STOPPED that more intense friend because it was fucking with their local shit.   Then they just....innocently backed away whistling like  'well, we were obviously the good guys here'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\\\\s just a thought i've had,  I know its an epic rant but am I making any sense here?!",

Not much coverage, just know the sides and be able to keep up when we get to WW2. WW2 is where we add in our moral high ground, which is then used to lead into our moral high ground as leaders of UN and the free world. Which leads straight into the Cold War and you basically just accept Russia/Communism became ideological-imperialists and we just kinda had to do that too for freedom and democracy. Then we say our job isn't done, and we had to go for the terrorists directly. Then we kinda mention the Gulf War, Desert Storm, etc. to back up the 911 narrative of a terrorism threat. Makes me wonder what it'll eventually say about what's happening now.",

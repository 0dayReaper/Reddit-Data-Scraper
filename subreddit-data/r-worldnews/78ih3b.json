The ads are paid for by \"The Coalition for American Freedom\" or somesuch nonsense that lists vague ideals on its website, it doesn't tell you much.\n\nThere's a ton of PACs and such that are essentially fronts, or ephemeral groups formed and discarded just as quickly. Been going on for decades for other reasons, but this is a solid reason to continue to pay for political ads (including online ones) in that manner.\n\nThat said, at least we'll know which links are paid political advertisements. So long as this applies to all political groups (e.g., Twitter doesn't start playing favorites and decide some groups \"aren't political\" despite being obviously politically-motivated), it's a very good thing.",

If that isn't a violation of the right to free speech then I don't know what is. \n\nThe first amendment doesn't distinguish between different sources of speech. It says \"the right of the people to peaceably assemble\" but it doesn't say the \"right of the people to speak freely\" it simply says that the freedom of speech shall not be abridged. The Supreme Court has ruled (correctly) that the speech is protected regardless of its source. \n\nIf this weren't the case we'd come to ridiculous conclusions like if an alien spaceship happened to land on earth and could somehow speak our language the government would have the right to censor them.",

A lot of smoking still has this whole 'edgy/cool' marketing factor associated with it and the anti smoking ads I saw tried to belittle that which only reinforced it ",

Their engineering team is slow to iterate and their PR moves are disastrous at times. Product focuses on inane metrics and don't know when to abandon a feature (e.g. get rid of lists, moments, DMs or iterate on them!).\n\nHowever, they've made several inroad to please their shareholders. Some include more strict guidelines for appropriate speech to curb cyber bully and harassment, their move towards profitability in 2017 which they met last quarter, as well as a revenue in the BILLIONS per year. It may be peanuts compared to GOOG or FB, but saying they don't know how to make money is... well, off. It's the reason they've had two big rounds of layoffs, for starter and cut benefits to employees.\n\nWho knew posting baby photos, idle thoughts, and all friends and family relationship would enable a company to build a better profile and thus ad selections than someone following random celebrities and meme accounts?",

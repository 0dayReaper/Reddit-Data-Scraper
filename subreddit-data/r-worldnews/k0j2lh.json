In contrast, distributism seeks to subordinate economic activity to human life as a whole, to our spiritual life, our intellectual life, our family life.\"[13] A few distributists[14] were influenced by the economic ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and his mutualist economic theory,[15] and therefore the lesser-known anarchist branch of distributism of Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker Movement could be considered a form of free-market libertarian socialism due to their opposition to both state capitalism and state socialism.[16]",

Plus all the older Catholics that, rather than trusting their Pope, have decided that he's an evil put in place to test their faith every since he told them to maybe not be quite so abusive to gay people. I know my grandfather and many of the friends he has made within in his Diocese are, among other things (birthers, anti-maskers, anti-vaxxers, Q-anoners), of the solid belief that Pope Francis is a satanic plant sent to test Catholics and, if they're ready, bring in the end times.",

Marked pews, cutting high-risk parts of the mass, strict limits on attendance, closed churches before most businesses closed in the initial lockdown etc. When masses restarted they very bluntly told people that God would not protect them and, much like Mary at the inn, they would be turned away due to lack of space for the health of all. \n\nMy church has plexiglass shields for communion, requires hand sanitizer before communion, requires masks, has people to orchestrate seating and leaving in an orderly and distanced manner, and has invested in equipment to live stream mass (timed with the most popular mass for young families) to help reduce people attending in person (which is how we\u2019ve done mass since this started. Not worth the risk to attend in person for my family).",

Basically, \"He accepts and loves people that I hate.\"\n\nAnd over and over, the things they are complaining about are his views that most resemble the radical \"love thy neighbor\" views that Jesus showed in the new testament. You know, the Jesus who was always hanging around poor people, prostitutes, and dirty lepers. Absolutely scandalous for that time.\n\nI guess my point is that people who denounce the pope for reasons like those...

They absolutely refuse to wear a mask because it's a Chinese hoax, yet when Biden says it's going to be a 'dark winter' as a result, they go off thinking there is an impending power grid collapse that is being hinted at and run out to buy generators.  [I'm not even fucking kidding](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/k0bsgo/covid19_is_real_and_its_a_cover_up_for_something/gdh8kmu/)  \n  \n&gt;Dark Winter = cyberattack to knock out our grid. We won't have power. Invest in a generator.  \n  \nDon't put a piece of cloth over your face when you go outside during a pandemic, but invest in a generator because the President elect is dropping hints only you can decipher about a power grid collapse.   They are so convinced that nothing is what it seems in a desperate attempt to think they are smarter than everyone else.  The worst part is, when this doesn't come to fruition, there is no moment of realization where they think, 'huh, maybe he was just telling us what to do for our own benefit.'  Nope, they'll be too busy stumbling down the next insane rabbit hole to reflect on their flawed, backwards thinking.  \n  \nI bet if experts came out today and publicly stated there is nothing to worry about any more, tomorrow these assholes would be walking around in full hazmat gear going, 'you ain't gonna fool me!'   \n  \nMaybe that's the solution.  Just tell them everything is fine and suddenly they'll be skeptical of that claim and start wearing masks.",

This needs to be *directed towards the pursuit of the common good*, for which the political community in particular must also take responsibility. Therefore, it must be borne in mind that grave imbalances are produced when economic action, conceived merely as an engine for wealth creation, is detached from political action, conceived as a means for pursuing justice through redistribution.\" (section 36)\n* \"The dignity of the individual and the demands of justice require, particularly today, that economic choices do not cause disparities in wealth to increase in an excessive and morally unacceptable manner, and that we continue to prioritize the goal of access to steady employment for everyone. All things considered, this is also required by \u201ceconomic logic\u201d. Through the systemic increase of social inequality, both within a single country and between the populations of different countries (i.e. the massive increase in relative poverty), not only does social cohesion suffer, thereby placing democracy at risk, but so too does the economy, through the progressive erosion of 'social capital'.\" (section 35)\n\nYou can be a Catholic or a free-market libertarian, but you can't be both.

People think that Francis is some Jesuit, liberal  anomaly for critiquing the excesses of capitalism, but this has firmly been Catholic social teaching for much of its modern history. Pope Benedict, despite being a \u201cconservative\u201d in the public imagination, wrote some pretty strongly worded encyclicals denouncing the worst aspects of capitalism. The Catechism actually spends more time criticizing unregulated, \u201claw of the market\u201d capitalism than it does communism. Heck, in the famous anti-communist encyclical from Pius XI, the pope actually BLAMES unregulated capitalism for the existence of communism. \n\nAttempts by American Catholics to reconcile their conservative political beliefs with their faith are trying to square a circle. It leads me to believe that at the end of the day, their identity as conservatives or right wingers matters more than the actual process of becoming a saint.",

John Paul II was a Cold War Pope who took every opportunity to call out dictators for ignoring their citizens and inspired the fall of many communist dictatorships. Benedict took sexual abuse seriously, encouraged the reporting of sexual crimes in the church to the cops and held that even cardinals are not above the law. \n\nIt just feels really shallow when someone sees a president or a pope reaping the hard work of his predecessors and says \"This star player is the best thing to ever happen to the team in its entire history\".",

Most American descend from the religious nutjobs who fled Briton because *they* couldn't persecute and they knew they could in the new colonies. Then, when they still couldn't get along on how to fuck over their fellow man, they divided into even smaller groups of religious nutjobs. Today, those religions outnumber Catholics, but not as any individual group of \"my Jesus is better than your Jesus\". \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3fAcxcxoZ8\n\nAt roughly 22% of the population of the United States, Catholicism is the largest religious denomination in the country with approximately 77.4 million members as of 2017. After Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines, the US comprises of the world\u2019s fourth-largest Catholic population. Similarly, the country consists of both the largest Catholic population of English-speakers and the largest population of Catholic minorities. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops is the central leadership body of the Catholic Church in the US. In the country, the Catholic Church is in communion with the Pope in Rome as it is part of the worldwide Catholic Church. According to the PEW Research Center, Rhode Island is the state with the largest population of Catholic residents, at 42%.",

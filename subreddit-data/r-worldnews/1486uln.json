[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And while I don't have children, if I did they'd be free to make their own choices concerning the military regardless of any ongoing conflicts.

Yes.\n\nI think the US is doing that through the aid they are providing Ukraine. I think Russia under Putin is a threat to the US and the rest of NATO, and Putin does consider the West and the US in particular his enemy. He may not be suicidal enough to engage the US in direct warfare at this point, but he certainly is willing to interfere in US elections, break up alliances (he bankrolled the Brexit campaign for example) and support far-right groups across the west while disrupting global trade which the US depends on for its wealth. We've fought a cold war against USSR for half a century and because Putin's imperialism we have little choice to fight a mini-cold war against Russia now. \n\nAnd besides all that I think there is case to made for the Ukrainians themselves, that there is reason to believe in them and their potential as an ally and friendly democracy and to protect them from genocide and conquest from their Russian neighbor. Some people stop at only defending their border, some people believe in larger concepts and defending those, and there are at least several thousand foreigners voluntarily fighting in Ukraine right now who believe just that. And yes for the vast majority of people and even countries they will put their own self-interests ahead of others, but in the US and most of NATO's case their own self-interests coincide with protecting Ukraine.",

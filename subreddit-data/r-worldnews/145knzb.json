            "comment": "Well, they're both right, just about different things.\n\nOn one hand, Le Maire is right.  Nuclear is absolutely part of the energy solution.  There's just no avoiding it, nor should people want to avoid it.  It's clean, it's safe, and the sooner we can build more fast-neutron reactors the sooner we can use them to dispose of existing LWR nuclear waste.\n\nOn the other hand, Wenzel is right.  Not all nuclear energy is renewable; only breeder-cycle nuclear energy is technically renewable, and most existing reactors are not breeders.  Also, he is right that it is important to draw a distinction between hydrogen cracked from hydrocarbons and hydrogen cracked from water.\n\nThey aren't really talking about the same things, here, and I suspect the author is putting these dissimilar situations side-by-side to make it appear as though Le Maire and Wenzel are disagreeing more than they actually are.",

But having a nuclear plant for every city and multiple plants in bigger cities is just not feasible.\n\nNow we are seeing solar panels with the potential to be close to 30% efficient, with panels costing 50% less than existing ones when demand increases. No poisonous chemicals used in panel manufacturing now and the ability to manufacture at room temperature makes them the only option for renewable right now.\n\nIf governments funded the new panel production and paid for installation on every roof in say the UK, it would cost around 250 billion pounds, include a two day battery backup in every home and it reaches 700 billion. But that would generate enough energy to have enough to export some.\n\nOver 10 years the project could be completed, generating jobs, good jobs and increasing tax income it would pay for itself in less than 5 years, and cut the cost of electricity to a few pounds a week to cover the cost of maintaining and improving the distribution network.\n\nSadly there are those that benefit from the existing systems where green energy costs more than fossil fueled energy and politicians skim there bit from the top. If electricity was basically free they would with there very rich friends lose a lot of easy income, so they talk about everything else but the real and only solution, which can only be solar on every roof.",

Luckily us humans just love to innovate! But I look at my home with insulation in walls  and loft and window coatings that prevent the cold or heat from entering. We as a species are innovators. I have no doubt we will overcome the problems just as we overcome the dirt solar panel manufacturing with clean methods and how battery storage systems are dropping in price fast , over 50% in the last 10 years at least. Nuclear could be used as a backup but with the average nuclear plant only able to supply 100 000 homes the biggest maybe 500 000 homes is unsustainable. That would mean America with 54 nuclear plants now would need another close to 300 plants.",

Along with 32 countries having operational plants with, what 3 total facility failures over how long with 1 death caused by 2 of them combined. If it wasn't for Chernobyl those accidents would be tiny little blips that mean next to nothing as Three Mile Island was still functioning till 2019 and Fukushima is seeing people move back. There is no longer a risk of one screw up with a complete meltdown and there never was a risk of an Entire country being uninhabitable forever. There are 440 reactors currently in operation, even if you include every single power plant incident since the first reactor was turned on there have been 33 serious incidents (which includes safety violations with no damage and temporary system operation suspension again with no damage) you have a failure rate of .075% a rate that shows it is super easy for a country to safely run a plant.\n\nNuclear is immensely safe and exceedingly power, it would require over 3 *million* solar panels to reach 1 reactor, 430 wind turbines that take over 75 times more space, tidal basically doesn't exist yet, and geothermal is so location specific it can never be mass adopted while still being far less effective than nuclear. To discount nuclear because of fears like yours is to dismiss the best option available because the USSR fucked up once in '86 is simply moronic. There is no logical reason to say no to nuclear, only irrational fears based on forgetting that safety standards increase.",

We do not have the mental capacity to use Nuclear as a technology.\n\nWe obviously don't and we obviously do, we've been doing it for 70 years. \n\nI swear people like you are so obnoxious, oh humans are the worst we're so dumb and terribly it's only luck were all not dead already, bunch of bullshit said by someone who thinks they're smarter than they really are. I had that phase when I was 17 before I realized I really didn't know nearly as much as I thought I did. World ain't gonna suddenly fall apart, reactors aren't going to all suddenly meltdown, and world leaders will actually largely assign competent people to appropriate positions because the world isn't going topsy turvy and humanity wont annihilate itself within a decade like you probably think.",

We have zero tolerance for radiation even though we surround ourselves with plenty of chemicals in far more carcinogenic concentrations. We keep remembering Fukushima when it killed pretty much no one amidst an earthquake that killed thousands. In fact this is probably part of why it's so hard and expensive. Yes, you don't want reactor meltdowns, but neither you want giant forest fires, flash floods, pollution, car exhaust in cities, and a ton of other things our dependence on fossil fuels causes, that kill many people, will kill more, and harm everyone's health. Even wind and solar aren't pollutant free, that's just not a thing that exists. We need to be able to dk a rational calculation about actual consequences, and fossil fuels lose that battle to just about any possible alternative.",

We're not at a point where we can solve climate change while *also* trying to use it as a vehicle for our completely unrelated political pet peeves. Besides, centralisation in itself is useful for logistical reasons, it's not like you can have private citizens owning their own geothermal plants or offshore wind turbines. Solar panels are the exception, not the rule. You can't put all your hopes of socioeconomic fairness into forcing physical decentralisation.",

Your Physics PhD gives you an understanding of the technicals on the science of Nuclear energy production but doesn\u2019t give you zip in terms of human\u2019s and government\u2019s abilities to keep it safe for us. So yeah go off as well. You don\u2019t seem to take into account how governments work or how politics work. And I would argue that your judgement is actually clouded by your PhD. \n\nI will destroy your argument on safety with one simple question.\n\nIf Nuclear is so safe, why does the US government spend huge amounts of time and attention with the very specific goal of making sure Iran does not have a Nuclear program?\n\nSee you can\u2019t actually have it both ways in the world. You can\u2019t say oh this is so safe, and then only allow certain counties to be able to take advantage of or control the technology. You can\u2019t say, oh France, you can do Nuclear, but no Iran, you can\u2019t. The solutions we come up with need to be unbiased. Everyone can use Solar, wind, tidal, and many other renewable solutions. Because they aren\u2019t tied to the production of Earth destroying weapons. \n\nNuclear is only safe in a perfect world. Governments come and go, they collapse, wars happen, crazy people take over from sane people. And when that happens, Nuclear can be used to hold the world hostage. It\u2019s not a solution, it\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen. We need less Nuclear not more. If we actually devoted real resources to renewables we would be there already, but honestly the advancements are happening so quickly, by the time they even design the plans to a new nuclear plant and start building it, other renewables will take over. \n\nThere are whole countries that are now running off renewables. It\u2019s entirely possible to do it and not ever touch Nuclear. And in fact obsessing on Nuclear to be part of the solution is bogging us down.",

That said, even if it was only NATO countries, India and China building nuclear power plants, that's like, most of your current energy consumption right there, and it can't make the nuclear armaments situation any worse. Could this process entail tensions? Sure, of course. You know what else entails tensions?

Huge amounts of resources and money spent of the pentagon\u2019s crazy budget just to make sure terrorists don\u2019t get their hands on any of it. The more plants the more chance of radioactive materials leaking into the wrong hands. \n\nSo France hadn\u2019t killed anyone yet in 70 years. So they get to put at risk cities and cultures that have been around for 1000\u2019s of years right next door? No country should have that allowance. You cannot contain a nuclear catastrophe just to your boarders, so running these plants shouldn\u2019t just be the decision of France. \n\nAnd deaths caused by Nuclear can\u2019t be counted accurately because most of them would be cancer from long term exposure or exposure years earlier. It\u2019s not as simple as, whatever deaths happened in a direct explosion near the facility.

Despite concerns about safety and waste, they believe nuclear power is necessary for their energy security. While some countries are phasing out nuclear power, France remains committed to using it as a primary source of energy.",

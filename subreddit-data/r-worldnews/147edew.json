Thousands of people showed up early on itching to fight with no combat training/experience (they were called Call of Duty soldiers) and ended up being more of a nuisance than actual benefit. I listened to a podcast where a Ukraning team leader mentioned that about half of those kids actually ended up ever seeing the frontline (the rest bailed before things even got that serious), and maybe 10% stayed on following their first firefight.\n\nYour actual military background and medic training is incredibly valuable, though. Ukraine badly needs medics, especially ones who know how to treat concussions (artillery warfare is still largely the name of the game and it does tons and tons of concussive damage to survivors) and are handy with a tourniquet, which are absolutely lifesaving devices. Lack of combat experience can be negotiated, but expect to see yourself possibly promoted to Medic/50 cal gunner if push comes to shove.",

They really are fighting with completely WWII tactics.\n\nOld Soviet tactics against the Nazis were to take an area and defend with multiple lines of trenches with artillery and *absolute shit tons* of mines.\n\nThey would wait for an attack, absorb it usually decimating the attackers, then counter-attack the attack assuming a few advantages:\n- that the attacking force has cleared portions of their lines of mines/defenses to facilitate the attack\n- the enemy having just failed and potentially exhausted wouldn't be able to resist the counter-attack as effectively \n\nIf Soviet forces broke through they'd exploit the breach until they had to dig in. \n\nRinse and repeat.",

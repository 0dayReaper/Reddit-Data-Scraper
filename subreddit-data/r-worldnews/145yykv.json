THOSE people are saying the person should do it not to make the person comfortable, but to make THEMSELVES comfortable with that person.\n\nAnd this leads to the second portion of the problem which is that the practice simply does not work. There has NEVER been a single methodology of conversion therapy which achieves scientifically replicable results, and a LOT of obvious harm is caused, and plenty of reason to suspect that those that claim it worked on them simply say that to avoid the social pressures that will come back if they admit it didn't work.\n\nIf the therapy actually worked, there's a solid discussion to be had over allowing it's use, but the fact of the matter is the therapy simply doesn't work and harms those who receive it, and people are functionally forced to receive it over social pressures. So there's no point in allowing it.",

There's plenty of kids and adults today who had they been born in an earlier time would have understood themselves as Cis-Het but today can feel safer in exploring other aspects of themselves and instead think of themselves as Bi/Pan/Ace/NB/etc. as we recognize that the actual category is less and less important and what **is** important is that everyone including Cis-Het folk have the opportunity to thrive as themselves.",

Same-sex couples can legally adopt in Iceland, and discrimination against LGBTQ+ people is illegal under Icelandic law.",

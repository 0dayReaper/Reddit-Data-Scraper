You usually don't include *everyone in the country* in a rating calculation. \n\nTheir PPV's bring in many more eyeballs, which their partnership with Saudi revolves around exclusive PPV events, so you'd want to compare with those instead. They may film an odd weekly show while there, but that's just out of convenience / logistical reasons.\n\nI'd say WWE has multiple tiers of fans, you could almost group them by:\n\n- Diehards: Those that watch every week (they'd be in the weekly show numbers).\n- Average: Those that may catch an odd show, but primarily just watch the big event shows (monthly \"PPV\" style)\n- Casual: Those that tune into 1 or more of the big four events.\n\nYou'll find different ratings for each.",

It's just that normal people aren't going to organize effectively most of the time.\n\nThink of it this way. Say you have a corporation that wants to make more money. They have a financial incentive to do something so they fund a SuperPAC. They have employees whose only job it is to fund this one project, like removal of a regulation. This is their life, their career. The corporation is likely going to have a formula. For every $1 invested, it'll make $100 in profit (politicians are cheap to rent).\n\nNow look at regular people. Say you have person who wants to make a change. They don't have much money because they're a normal person. So they talk to others. They might join, might not. How much time do they have? Not much since it's a volunteer job. So they have a regular job - and a life, family, etc - and then there's this part time cause. Their new recruits? Same thing. Oh and not a lot of money to throw at this either. So they need to have a TON more recruits. They start a formal SuperPAC and donate $500 each - a lot of money for vast majority. They grow though donations are small. $100. $50. Sometimes $5. They grow and reach a million people after a few years. That's a lot! But only half donate and the average is $20. $10 million dollar SuperPAC. Not bad! Now to contact all those politicians who don't know you exist.\n\nBut a corporation stands to lose $5b as a result so they hire people and fund it with 1% of the lost profit, instantly raising $50m and they hire lobbyists who already have connections with those politicians, presuming they're not former politicians themselves.\n\nCan that one person's SuperPAC hire those same lobbyists? Sure but this means the fund is going to be less - good lobbyists are expensive - and the really good lobbyists are ones who want continued income rather than one person's quest. So they'd rather stick with an organization that's already established rather than a brand new one that might fizzle out next year and that's presuming there's continued interest and funds.",

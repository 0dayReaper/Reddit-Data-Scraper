It has been fantastic (bar a few trackpad issues that I\u2019ve resolved) and for sub $1000 it\u2019s an insane deal\n\nI originally got an Asus all AMD build and it was unusable. The physical build quality of Asus is nice but definitely do not go with an AMD GPU, the drivers are an absolute train wreck \n\nMy personal rec is to look for sales on the following:\n\n- HP Omen\n- Lenovo Legion\n- Asus Zephyr\n\nIdeally you probably want:\n\n- 3060 or better for 1080p, 3070 or better for 2k/4k (DO NOT get a 3050, they suck)\n- 16gb ram minimum. DDR5 is good but don\u2019t pay a premium for it, it isn\u2019t much better than ddr4\n- minimum 6 cores for CPU, i7/Ryzen 7 or higher is ideal but you could get away with i5/Ryzen 5 depending on your needs\n- screen size depends on if you\u2019re planning to use an external monitor much and how portable you need it to be. The Asus Zephyr 14s are nice and portable, but could be a bit cramped for certain use cases especially being 1080p. I personally preferred the 2k 16\u201d form factor for the bigger screen and more real estate",

I didn't know about their shitty build quality till the keyboard shit out on me *right after the warranty was up*, and when I had to replace the fan in it.\n\nI'd really like to get an Asus sometime in the near future, but I can't find one that says anything about being able to upgrade RAM, and it's ridiculously expensive to just get one with plenty of RAM already in it. I know they have AMD driven models, but I need both features!",

Had to change my motherboard because the PSU was shoddy, and then the PSU once I gained a bit of technical knowledge as a kid. It came with a 1440*900 Monitor that immediately had dead pixels a month after use, got it replaced, only to have bright pixels in entire fucking lines, until we got a partial refund and got an LG monitor which last me well after the Acer died.",

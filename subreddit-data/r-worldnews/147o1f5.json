[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The ones whose ancestors came from Europe are the Ashkenazi Jews. Those whose ancestors came from the ME and North Africa are the Mizrahi Jews, most of whom fled or were driven out of their ancestral homes, and they are currently a *majority* of the Jewish-Israeli population. \n\nWhat happened on the formation of Israel was a partition - disastrous like many such partitions have been, but not uniquely or solely the fault of the Israelis. \n\nIn fact, about equal numbers on both sides were involved: \n\nThe \u201cNakba\u201d involved 700k Palestinians fleeing or being forced out of what is now Israel: \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba#:~:text=The%20term%20is%20used%20to,refugee%20camps%20throughout%20the%20region.\n\nThe \u201cJewish Exodus from the Muslim World\u201d involved 950k Jews fleeing or being forced out of their nations - of which 650k settled in Israel: \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_the_Muslim_world#:~:text=The%20Jewish%20exodus%20from%20the,80%20following%20the%20Iranian%20Revolution.",

But during the 1940s, waves of Jews arrived from Arab nations that kicked out their Jewish populations. Ironically, those Arab nations helped create Israel, and now a bit more than half of Israeli Jews are descended from those people who were kicked out.  \n   \n&gt;They settled in a land that is not theirs,\n\nThe Ottoman empire, which controlled that land for 400 years?  \n   \n&gt;killed many of its population and made many refugees, stole their homes\n\nThere were pogroms against the Jews as well because a lot of the locals didn't like the idea of Jewish immigration to the area. Especially during the 1940s, when palestinian leadership was aligned with Hitler (see Amin al-Husseini, who was spreading nazi propaganda around the region). Also, it is often disregarded that much of the land was actually bought from people who owned land in the area. Conflicts ensued, which eventually became wars. When you lose a war you gotta cope and move on. The country I live in lost 75% of its land after WW1, it had to sit down and cope if it wanted to develop, and that's what it did. And this country has been here over 1000 years. Palestine was never even a country.",

Helping people who are suddenly on the receiving end of a flood - during a war - it would break even the strongest persons spirit.  and yet the Ukrainians seem to have that grit and indomitable spirit to go on.   \n To know, that a country, not even a neighbor, will take up the challenge to provide the logistics and materials to supply the people with clean food and clean water... well it just brings it back to basics, doesn't it? just be good to each other, share, help, and so much will just fall into place.  Thank you Israel for doing this.  I hope the people of Ukraine receive it and can distribute as soon as humanly possible.",

If these aren\u2019t good enough because they\u2019re post Zionism, how about mentioning the fact that Jews under Arab law were dhimmis liable to the jizya tax, or mentioning the many pogroms throughout the 16th, 17th, and 19th centuries, spanning Hebron, Safed, and Tiberias? Why was the Jewish population so much smaller than the Arab population in the region they called Palestine? Huh. I wonder. Maybe they just had one child per family for 1500 years.\n\nThe notion that all things were fluffy and sweet before the evil Zionist force of nature showed up is utterly fanciful. Zionism is the freedom movement of the Jewish people to self determine in their ancestral homeland. It\u2019s not fanaticism, it\u2019s just the movement of a historically oppressed people wanting to be free from oppression. Be critical of Israel, that\u2019s healthy, but when you realize Israel, the one Jewish state in the world, is the one country antizionists consider to be illegitimate, then you realize anti-Zionism is just a front for antisemitism. \n\nYou can go on to teach whatever you\u2019re going to teach, but you\u2019ll be a messenger for bigotry, racism, and lies. That will be your legacy, and that will be the side of history you fall under.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; THE HAGUE, Netherlands - The Supreme Court of the Netherlands on Friday ordered that a Dutch museum&amp;#039;s trove of historical treasures from Crimea be sent to Ukraine, upholding a lower court ruling that the 300 artifacts are part of Ukraine&amp;#039;s cultural heritage.\n\n&gt; The collection of archaeological objects, some more than 2,000 years old, was on display at the Allard Pierson Museum in Amsterdam when Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, sparking a dispute over the repatriation of the borrowed pieces.\n\n&gt; The Crimean museums appealed and Russia threatened to stop lending objects to Dutch museums if the museum didn&amp;#039;t return the pieces.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/14555yv/dutch_supreme_court_orders_museum_artifacts/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688328 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Museum**^#1 **Court**^#2 **objects**^#3 **Ukraine**^#4 **Allard**^#5",

Plus, what some say is damaging others say is letting it be natural. For instance, Native Americans have some beliefs that feathers contain the spirit of the bird. As a result, keeping them in a museum is killing the spirit if it isn\u2019t actively in ceremonial use. This is why many people are massive fans of 3D printed or scanned models being used instead especially when religion is involved.\n\n&gt;Actually they shouldn't be returned at all and instead traded for artifact of the country hosting them. \n\nThat's not how it works. The usual process like what was done in this case is museums loaning each other works from their collection. This is actually rediculously common where most advertised collections are on loan from other institutions and nearly every single museum has a loan program. \n\n&gt;Having everything in on location iS jsut dumb.\n\nIt is which is why this isn't done. The museums constantly loan out collections. Most museums actually have a decent portion loaned out at any given time. I saw one mention that 30% on loan was very common.",

The larger point is that it should be up to the people/museum of origin not some foreign entity. Given the occupation of Crimea is illegal, this would still be Ukrainian property/culture of origin.\n\n&gt;Also if I understand right it's not like these were stolen by the Dutch or anything.

Museums lend pieces out to each other all the time.\n\nIn this case, the issue was that the lending from Crimean museums occurred before the Russian occupation of Crimea.\n\nThe Dutch museum held the items in storage until this court ruling determined to whom they should be returned.",

Before they were due to be returned Russia invaded Crimea and took over those museums. The issue was does the Dutch museum return them to Russian occupied Crimea or since they belong to Ukraine do they go back to the Ukrainian government to avoid being looted by Russia.",

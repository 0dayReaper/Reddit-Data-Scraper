Puppen is about a child hearing their sister having sex to make money for them to survive.  Spell MIT Mir is about being sexual abused as a child.\n\nTons of artists sing about these things as a way of bringing awareness to situations that people find uncomfortable.  It really in no way makes them monsters.  \n\nUntil these allegations have hard evidence it's all here say, and trying to condemn someone by using their art against them is simply ludicrous and narrow minded.\n\nIt's like saying that all people who write or sing about rape or murder and horrible experiences are inherently terrible people.",

But come on, really? We're all going to act surprised and shocked? I seen the band Poison talk about how they sent guys into the crowd so they could select who they wanted to fuck. And that was on VH-1 \"Behind the Scenes\" show. So I find all this fuss to be really really stupid. Yes, rock stars fuck groupies. They always have.

Of course I don't condone rape. My point is, this is nothing new, provided no one was raped. But let's be honest here, lots of men ply women with drugs and alcohol, to fuck them. Most don't claim rape. So the point of Ted Nugent is only that this is nothing new. It's always been going on and in Ted Nugents case, a judge had to approve it. At the time, people thought nothing of it. Lots of people still married at age 16 back then. Unless someone is charging this guy with rape, it's all just bullshit. That's what I'm saying.",

When everyone in the industry knows that there is something happening and that there are people who \"cast\" many young women. When Lindemann wrote poems about how he loves to rape drugged or unconscious women, produced hard core pornohraphic contents in which he heavily abuses women who seem to be at least drugged and tons of young woman now speak up about what happened to them. Then why is it so hard to believe that the accusations might actually be true? Why don't you actually inform yourself about that all instead of making up a hypothetical scenario? If you still don't believe them at least listen to them. Because if you do then you might realise that your question on whether he needs to resort to drugging might gets answered.

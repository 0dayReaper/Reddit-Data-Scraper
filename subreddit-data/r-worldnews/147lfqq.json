[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2.

The ones that submit focus on the things being done to them that are beyond the pale and realize they can't/won't respond in kind. This is how bullies thrive. Once in awhile a group of people adhere to their beliefs, refuse to sink to their opponent's level and overcome. Ukrainians are such people.",

Just think about what people thought of Russian gamers back when things were relatively peaceful. They didn't turn out that way in a vacuum. It's a country whose politicians fight for the right to beat women, where men statistically die young from alcoholism and stupid risk taking, where toxic masculinity is celebrated, where people spit on people for their success when it doesn't somehow benefit them.",

Caught a bit of Russian news when visiting family years before the war, and they were just talking about how great Stalin was. They put a hateful man who committed genocide against his own people on a pedestal on state fucking TV. The country has no future in any case. They've killed off their young workers and scared away their educated. I don't know how to fix it and quite frankly I don't care.\n\nAt the start of the war they were dedicating hours on their news networks to talk about how bad russophobia is in the West. Their people are convinced that they are the victims in all this. I don't know how they'll ever be fixed. It's not like WW2 where they can be shown their own atrocities, Ukraine isn't about to invade Russia just to educate its people.",

Works and installations containing dangerous forces, **namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives,** if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. Other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.\n\n(my emphasis)\n\nNow, the US ~~is not a signatory to~~ did not ratify these additional protocols - and neither is Russia, I believe.  But clearly, there is international recognition that it's a crime, just not by the big boys I guess.\n\nTo expand further, here's an article talking about a US strike on a dam in Syria that failed, and whether that would have been a war crime:\n\nhttps://lieber.westpoint.edu/attacking-dams-part-i-customary-international-law/\n\n&gt; **Non-international Armed Conflict**\n\n&gt; The strike on Tabqa Dam was governed by the customary law of non-international armed conflict because 1) that is the character of the U.S. hostilities with ISIS and 2) the United States is not a Party to the 1977 Additional Protocol II, a treaty examined in Part II of this series.\n\nUkraine vs Russia would **not** be *non-international* armed conflict.  Furthermore:\n\n&gt; The San Remo Manual on the Law of Non-International Armed Conflict likewise supports this conclusion: \u201cAttacking dams, dykes, or nuclear electrical generating stations is forbidden if the attack might cause the release of water or radioactivity and, as a result, excessive collateral damage to civilian objects and incidental injury to civilians\u201d (section 4.2.3). Its commentary goes on to note, \u201cparticular care must be taken in attacking works and installations containing dangerous forces so as to avoid releasing those forces, thereby causing severe losses among the civilian population.\u201d\n\nBasically, don't, unless a) you didn't sign the additional protocols, b) you're fighting ISIS, which doesn't count as an \"international\" conflict because they're not a nation and/or c) make sure the bad guys have mounted weapons on it or something.  Then and only then can you feel safe blowing it up.  Maybe.  If you don't fuck up lots of civilians.\n\nThe US put the dam in question on an explicit no-strike list.\n\nIt seems like something best avoided.\n\nLastly:\n\nhttps://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/apii-1977/state-parties?activeTab=default\n\nUkraine ratified Protocol II in 1990.  The US never ratified it.",

Cities usually need to raise as much money as possible to reduce the budget deficit.\n\nEdit: [This is a pretty interesting breakdown of how the fireworks show in San Diego benefits the city](https://bigbayboom.com/donate/benefits/). If Sydney achieves similar economic outcomes, then the show should generate much more funding for the wildfire crisis compared to canceling and donating.",

Here on my island we had a local fireworks guy who wanted to take back his world record for number of rockets fired and raise money for a local charity at the same time. He was all set to do it, had approval and everything, when someone in a government department decided they had environmental concerns over that many rockets being fired over the sea. And they were probably right, but it was so last-minute that he'd already bought the fireworks, had no way to sell them on (and they do eventually go bad), and *then* had to guard them day and night for over a year because they're explosives. He ended up losing nearly half a million pounds and had to sell his house.\n\nEventually the police helped him dispose of them in batches and he got \u00a350,000 compensation from the government.",

I\u2019m a dog owner who lives near Docklands in Melbourne, they are the bane of my existence.

Could it be better? Yes, and it would be if money diverted into private health was instead spent on public health infrastructure. (Along with private tollways, but that\u2019s for another time). It may be Top 5 now, but you may see that figure fall as public health gets underfunded and rebates to private health care replaces it. Actually your comment makes me think that the definition of quality of care may not decrease, but certainly the accessibility to health care may become more difficult for many. When things change so slowly that people don\u2019t notice or care, it\u2019s often too late when they do.",

We have a semi-private system where you are forced to have private health cover and every year the government whittles down the list of things you can have covered in the public system, and reduces the healthcare budget. The 'strong social welfare program' doesn't give a lot of those people enough to live on... Except the pensioners (a strong voting block), and a welfare most of us won't get because of the Super System.\n\nAgain I agree those things exist in Australia, but they have been and are being systematicly eroded and dismantled.",

This is like the equivalent of planning Christmas dinner, paying in advance for Christmas dinner, taking christmas dinner home from the grocery store, cooking it entirely, plating it, putting christmas music, telling everyone \"5 minutes to dinner!\" and then cancelling it 1 minute before. Its all done, its all been paid for, its been shipped, its been prepped and loaded, you might as well have dinner.",

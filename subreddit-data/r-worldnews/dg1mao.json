There were nights when it was 30 minutes before the episode was to air, and they hadn't sent them the digital copy for them to air.\n\nSometimes Comedy Central doesnt  know all the content of the episode because they didnt get it to them in time for them to review it. \n\nThe show has been so successful that they finally stopped worrying and just made sure there was always someone ready to retrieve the digital copy and get it ready to run.\n\nI don't think I have that much faith on anyone. \n\nEdit: one word",

            "comment": "Guys if HK protestors start waving signs for Tegridy Farms I think we'll be slowly moving back into the good timeline.\n\nEdit: alright...this blew up. While ya'll are here for the jokes, I'd like to bring attention to Michael Spavor: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/16/canadians-detained-in-china-charged-with-espionage\n\nHe's an acquaintance of mine who has been locked up in a Chinese jail now since like December of last year. This and some other incidents have been hitting home for me that this shit is mega real. It's VERY obvious that China is exporting their authoritarianism. I'm glad people are starting to wake up to it. The stuff with the NBA and Blizzard (and for fuck's sake I know people affected by the Hearthstone shit too) are a taste of what these fuckers want. I'm assuming Michael is basically as \"ok\" as you can be while the Huawei CEO is still under house arrest, but no one in our friend circle has heard from him. I'm hoping that at least his family has.",

The most guiding influences in life now are religion and socio-economy, and with hard religion (well, western christianity) falling as an influence, we are joined by our class. \n\nThe underclasses are still the masses beholden to those in power as they ever were, but we are aware we aren't alone, and the goals of those in power are as narrow as ours, greed through power, and freedom through options.",

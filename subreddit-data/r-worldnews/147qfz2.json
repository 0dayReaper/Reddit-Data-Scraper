[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most of Europe celebrates the defeat of nazism on the 8th, russia on the 9th (due to different time zones, it was the 9th in russia but still the 8th in most of Europe when the nazis formally surrendered).\n\nSo this is a symbolic move to budge even closer to Europe and away from russia and not a long overdue beginning of celebrating the defeat of nazi germany as some seem to think.",

Eisenhower didn't accept this though.\n\nThe signing of the Instrument of Surrended was delayed until very late on May 8th because the Allied leaders couldn't agree which ones of them would get to sign the document. In fact, the final signing didn't happen until 1AM on the 9th. Despite this, the Allies announced that the surrender was completed on 22:43 on May 8th, Central European time. In Moscow time, that was early on the 9th.",

Fair to note, though, that the full first quote, in the context of putting down an uprising in its \u2018League of Nations mandate\u2019 over post-Ottoman Iraq was:\n\n&gt; It is sheer affectation to lacerate a man with the poisonous fragment of a bursting shell and to boggle at **making his eyes water** by means of **lachrymatory gas**. I am strongly in favor of using poisoned gas against uncivilized tribes. The moral effect should be so good that the loss of life should be reduced to a minimum. It is not necessary to use only the most deadly gasses: gasses can be used which cause great inconvenience and would spread a lively terror and yet would leave no serious permanent effects on most of those affected.\n\nHe was saying it\u2019s more moral to use **tear gas** against rebels than to shoot people with bullets and shells.\n\nSo it\u2019s certainly a hawkish imperialist talking, and not going to defend that, but it\u2019s not what the quote sounds like out of context at all.",

In fact the only reason he makes those comments about natives is precisely because society had moved firmly towards recognising their genocide as a crime by that point.\n\nHell it isn't even a particularly British view he's taken anyway. The main reason the US persecuted the natives so badly is most of them fought for the British Empire during the revolution.",

A decent job of $60,000 in NYC is equivalent to only $20,000 a year in Texas due to how high rent and cost of living is.\n\nThat\u2019s why so many native NYers are leaving. Why pay $2000+ for a tiny one studio apartment when you can get a nice one bedroom for $800 or less in other parts of the country",

A decent job of $60,000 in NYC is equivalent to only $20,000 a year in Texas due to how high rent and cost of living is.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That\u2019s why so many native NYers are leaving. Why pay $2000+ for a tiny one studio apartment when you can get a nice one bedroom for $800 or less in other parts of the country\n\nI have some thoughts about that. I live in Austin, but I'm considering moving to possibly NYC at some point.  \n\n\nYes, cost of living is higher, but there are opportunities that you get in NYC that you don't get in Austin, not to mention Texas overall. Opportunities are usually underestimated. You can land a job that you wouldn't have landed in Waco, or meet people who open your mind etc. This is hard to estimated. Not to mention exposure to different cultures, meeting different people etc. I agree with money argument to SOME extend, but usually cities in Texas where you can live for 20k/yr are dead cities.",

I know a lot of Border Patrol guys get stationed in those tiny border towns that are basically high in poverty and low income. Those guys live like kings there lol\n\nImagine a town where average salary is about 35k and you\u2019re making 50k+. Rent is only about 700. And it\u2019s a federal job so the benefits mean you\u2019re taken care of. Insane to conceive",

(Same with New York and most of these other places.)\n\nThis does create a kind of feedback loop however, where less cash-rich industries that used to be based in London, but couldn't possibly compete with those higher-paying industries for talent, move out of London. Hence increasing the London average pay in the process.\n\nThe only industries that don't, are those that are physically tied to London, like entertainment, retail, etc. They remain low payers and have to rely on underhand means to keep their costs down.",

Regardless of whether your place is public housing, private apartment or private landed property, you can rent a portion or the entirety out. \n\nCovid caused massive delays in public housing projects, extending wait times from 3 years to 6 years or more, which caused more locals (especially newly weds, or those looking to start a family) to resort to renting, whilst waiting for their apartments to be completed. \n\nThen you have an increase in expats due to the Hong Kong-China situation in the past few years where more Hong Kongers have chosen to move to Singapore to avoid being under an increasingly dominant overlord in China, and you also have more companies that are relocating their Asia Pacific hubs from HK to Singapore for the same reason. \n\nSo we have this situation where housing is increasingly expensive due to the supply shortage, which causes a huge demand on the rental market. Despite expats leaving due to the increase in costs, there are also a lot of new expats moving in due to HK, so all in all rental prices have increased a minimum of 50% in the last year, which is hurting and pricing out a lot of locals who simply can\u2019t afford to compete against expats who are usually much better compensated.",

So not only you will be evicted if you can't pay the rent on the day it's due , you will also have a gigantic debt that lowers you're credit score dramatically , so you can't even get a loan or credit card anywhere. Throughout the Bolsonaro government, you could visually see on the streets the amount of homeless people rising every dayml.",

The bigger issue is there\u2019s just such a lack of availability that even if your budget were unlimited you\u2019d still struggle to find anywhere and the quality is not great.\n\nWhatever\u2019s going on demand is totally outstripping supply, yet the construction sector seems to be dragging its feet or unable to get adequate investors - perhaps it\u2019s become excessively risk averse since the financial crisis in 2008 and speculators etc, but it\u2019s resulting in a mess and it seems to be repeated in many cities.\n\nBuying a home is expensive but not nearly as bad as renting.\n\nThere\u2019s going to have to be a crunch at some point though. Disposable income in so many cities around the world is being absorbed by runaway housing costs and the impact of that is falling living standards. People will eventually get annoyed.",

So much greenery, culture, great local food. Obviously not ideal to be skimping on having fun going out and spending more often, but day to day is pretty lovely where I live. \nOfc many many people live in dire conditions at no fault of their own, just as wanted to say that it\u2019s possible to have a nice life here on a low income if you are lucky and find a good spot to live.",

You\u2019d be lucky to find a decent $2,000 apartment in decent place in NYC. Most $2,000 apartments are in shitty neighborhoods with dirty landlords and rising costs everywhere. It\u2019s bad enough that finding a place to live costs half your salary, yet you are also levy a premium for everything you buy, $5 for a gallon of milk anyone? Among the highest sales, income, state &amp; city taxes - I remember how the City Council shamelessly gives itself salary raises that surpass $100,000. I\u2019m not against taxes, but the average Newyorker gets milked for every penny. \n\nPlaces like NYC, San Francisco, London are dead end places for not only young people, but for anyone that\u2019s not a professional working in Finance, Technology or some other lucrative field. I remember how 20 years ago a 2 story house in Brooklyn would cost no more than $300k, now those same homes are selling for at a minimum $1 million. \n\nOne of the best decisions of my life was to leave NYC and stop paying rent - money that I will never see again. I\u2019m now the proud owner of my first house, it\u2019s not very fancy, but my god, it\u2019s so good to have the freedom to never have to give half my salary each month, not have to worry about my apartment catching on fire, I have a backyard, and finally own a dog. True freedom is the American Dream. Idk if Britain has a British Dream, idk how young folks over the can afford anything anywhere, the island seems incredibly crowded, specially when so much real estate is being purchased by wealthy foreigners and their families. What is specially sad is how so many of these vacation mansions sit empty.",

It can work, however currently we have a lot of corporate real estate investors buying up places or building places with the intention of marketing that real estate as \u201cluxury\u201d. Take where I live. A few new apartments complexes just got built. You would think that would drive the prices down. But instead you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a studio in one of those apartments running for less then 1700 a month. The only affordable apartments being rent controlled to that amount in rough areas. And the older decent apartments are matching those same prices. Supply and demand can work, however current practices interfere with this. \n\nTokyo and Auckland very well might be outliers, with Tokyo in particular being an extreme outlier because Japan\u2019s population as a whole is shrinking, so building homes and apartments there is causing a cost reduction because the building does offset the demand. There\u2019s outright homes and apartment buildings just sitting and rotting in Japan, even right in Tokyo as we speak. That\u2019s prime land ready to be built on. I don\u2019t have any knowledge as far as Auckland goes but that\u2019s what I know as far as Japan.",

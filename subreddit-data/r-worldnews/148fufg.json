[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We know they're Russian nukes, we know Putin is a Megalomaniac and Belarus is a puppet government to Russia that won't do a god damn thing without being told, and Lukashenko knows the US nuclear retaliation policy. He knows it's suicide and the end of him, his nation, his masters, everything he ever knew. Losing is better than dying, because if Putin falls, he might just have a shot of taking control of his own country. In the worst case scenario, if the eagles go flying, Lukashenko will blame Putin IMMEDIATELY. He's told to rattle his sabre, and that's exactly what he's going to do. Even Putin knows that nuclear retaliation is assured, because the US state department explicitly told him we know where he is at all times, and any nuclear exchange starting from the Russian bloc, and we will nuke him PERSONALLY. This is all the swan song of a failing nation, failing dictator, and ineffectual propaganda machine that isn't even a shadow of what it was at the height, or even at the fall, of the Soviet Union. It's not working for them. No one is buying their bullshit. The article is just covering the news, it's not reflecting the response from the international community. The populace can freak out all they want, which is fine, because the populace isn't running shit. Cooler, better informed heads are. Thankfully we aren't controlled by mob rule.",

He's got Russian troops guarding Russian nukes on what used to be sovereign Belarus territory. \n\nThat's what Ukraine avoided with the Orange revolution, and why they are forced to fight now.",

I doubt they even have warheads on them. \n\nAt this point Russia can barely produce enough munitions to be effective in this war, why would they just give weapons away? \n\nNot that tactical nukes aren\u2019t devastating, but on the very slim chance that Belarus obtained Russian nuclear weapons, we can be 100% sure they did not receive ICBM, not that they would be needed to hit Ukraine from inside Belarus. \n\nThe strangest part of the whole \u201cwe\u2019ll nuke you if you do xyz\u201d, is that the radiation would carry into Belarus and Russia. Good luck fighting any war after you\u2019ve irradiated the entry points for your military, not to mention you just destroyed land inside your own borders\n\nPutin and Lukashenko might wanna check out the videos of Gaddafi\u2019s last minutes, because that\u2019s what\u2019s in their future.",

Article 5 is negotiable and has been suspended many times in the course of NATO membership. It can be suspended for the duration of this conflict, it can be altered to affect only certain areas like \"any area west of Dnipro\"  \n\n\nAlso article 5 does not require member nations to commit armed forces or force of any kind. It only requires them to provide \"assistance deemed necessary by the member nation to help restore security\"  \n\n\nThis assistance can be logistical, humanitarian, or simply the supply of offensive/defensive weaponry such as they're already being provided.",

It\u2019s fucking Russia; A world super power with a large (possibly shitty) Nuclear stockpile. If it wasn\u2019t invoked after the Kakhova dam was blown up, it won\u2019t be invoked. Many wish it was and I understand that. This is Occam\u2019s Razor we are discussing fucking with. \nPutting Russia in a corner that it can\u2019t get out of would be catastrophic for the world. I have little doubt that this type of decision making would ensure a Nuclear munition being used or the further destruction of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear plant being blown to kingdom come. Yes of course this would be blamed on Ukraine shelling. Doesn\u2019t matter. The damage to south eastern Ukraine, the Dnipro, etc would be catastrophic and not fixable in this lifetime.",

They're obligated to provide any assistance deemed necessary to restore and maintain security. Individual member nations can decide what assistance they will provide and they're not obligated to use of force.

The EU and US are looking to gently corner Russia while stoking internal propaganda to make Putin a pariah worthy of being overrun by his own countrymen and women. \nAllowing Ukraine to ascend to NATO would cause a massive rift with both Russia and China. In a sense meaning that whatever gloves both are wearing will come off. Insane decisions costing human life and infrastructure would be the fallout. Nuclear material in the hands of folks we (most of the world) would like to avoid, and so on. This is a delicate situation. NATO is likely trying to stay clean.",

I was referring to people that are in the United States that may not have heard of Cargo Cults or The Prince Philip Movement.  \n\nI think we're all on the same page now.",

Your wife recovers and the hospital photographer comes in and you have the baby\u2019s outfit ready and sure enough the baby\u2019s feet are just too fat.  But these things have some value so the friend says just sell them and buy the baby some bigger clothes with the proceeds.\n\nYou put an ad in the paper: \u201cbaby shoes, never worn.\u201d\n\nSome jerk author who is on his seventh mojito sees it and starts crying.  He makes it into a story.  You try to explain to people \u201cnah, the baby is okay.  He\u2019s already crawling.\u201d  But nah, people keep saying how sad it is.\n\nSkip several years later and you hear that author offed himself and you and your fully grown kid with his huge feet want to feel sad, but you can\u2019t, because that jerk didn\u2019t even do his due diligence to get the story right.",

He comes up to ours &amp; very sedately nods. Before he can say anything, one of my peers, a young black guy who was a complete stoner through and through, sticks his hand out and says \"put 'er there!\" with a giant shiteating grin on his face. Prince Philip looks at his hand, back up to his face, does the most subtle of shrugs and shakes hand. And then went around our tiny circle of 6 or 7 and shook all of our hands. He chatted for only a moment before moving on to the next group; we were the only group to get handshakes, needless to say. Apparently it was all the scandal of the day.",

Oh no, it's too violent, we play soccer. He didn't seem impressed with that either and moved on. That was funny in retrospect.\n\nHe ordered the school board to give us a day off from school, so he won some fans\n\nI tried telling a teacher at my Junior High the next year that he had visited my elementary school, she called me a liar in front of the whole class. I told her to phone the school, she refused. She asked why he would visit my elementary school, I mentioned the WWF and she got wide-eyed.\n\n[https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/office-of-the-premier/intergovernmental-relations-secretariat/protocol/official-visits/past-royal-tours/royal-tour-timeline#1990](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/office-of-the-premier/intergovernmental-relations-secretariat/protocol/official-visits/past-royal-tours/royal-tour-timeline#1990)\n\n**1992, March 7 to 12**\u00a0 (British Columbia and Alberta)  \nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh attended World Wildlife Fund engagements in Vancouver and Victoria.",

She also put it into her notes that we were all to wear bright colorful clothing to the funeral, to tell funny stories and laugh, and then when we got home (This is a few months ago so couldn\u2019t go out to eat), she somehow had arranged for a catered meal for our family with a shit ton of her favorite alcohol for us to have a party with.

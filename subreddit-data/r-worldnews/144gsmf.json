An area about 300 miles (480 km) long, averaging 20 miles (32 km) in width,[23] and covering 5,000 to 6,000 square miles (13,000 to 16,000 km2) was under water.[17] The water flooding the Central Valley reached depths up to 30 feet (9.1 m), completely submerging telegraph poles that had just been installed between San Francisco and New York. Transportation, mail, and communications across the state were disrupted for a month.[24] Water covered portions of the valley from December 1861, through the spring, and into the summer of 1862.[17]",

Also they're kind of huge slow systems so (I heard today) even the el Nino effects lag by two months or so. \n\nI recall the first suspicions of global warming back in ~1978: the biggest issue was that by the time we had enough data to prove it was happening, it would be too late to do much about it. We'd have baked in a change, and it would still be increasing for decades even if we all went to live in caves.  \n\nThe classic suspicion at that time was that the UK would get colder and wetter (especially if the gulf stream died) even if most of Europe was battling heat and drought.",

It's been lovely to see all the animals and insects thriving amongst all the lush, green growth, but I feel we're going to get whiplash going in the other direction.\n\nFiries I know are equally uneasy.",

This could catapult global temperatures past the critical 1.5C mark, intensifying droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events worldwide. Literally EVERY day we delay meaningful action, our battle against climate change grows more daunting. \n\nDespite this urgency, it's crucial not to fall into apathy, thinking nothing can be done.  We CANNOT accept defeat.  We have the power to mitigate these effects through active engagement in voting and policy-making. Join forces with organizations like the [Environmental Voter Project](https://www.environmentalvoter.org/) and the [Citizens\u2019 Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=online-035&amp;utm_source=online&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=035) if you\u2019re in the US. Support the re-introduction of the [Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/get-loud-take-action/energy-innovation-act/). Seize this opportunity, for every little action towards a sustainable future counts. \n\nIt\u2019s not too late, but each day of inaction makes the challenge more difficult. We can turn the tide of climate change, but it starts with us. The time for action is now.",

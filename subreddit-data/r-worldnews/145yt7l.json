It would (ideally) cut down on a lot of traffic congestion and urban pollution too.  Heck, not needing a car whatsoever would save people *thousands* of dollars every year, and improve people's ability to save up to buy a house, or for their retirement, or give them more money to spend on vacations and goods.  \n\nBut nah, it's somehow a \"socialist\" conspiracy to lock people in their neighbourhoods and take away their freedoms, or something like that.",

An excellent speech to the Ukraine Vekrhovna Rada - here are the highlights:\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You are fighting not only for your survival but for everything. For democracy and freedom. The world can't underestimate the importance of the moment and your struggles. You are fighting for yourself, your language, your homes, and the future of all of us.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Your victory will be in the history books, and you will determine the future of the 21st century.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Canada will be with you for as long as necessary. You don't give up, and so we won't give up.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Today, we announced US$400 million for military support, and Canada will be part of the coalition to train your pilots.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It should be Ukraine's choice of how to defend itself, and Canada will support Ukraine's accession into NATO.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We want peace, but we want it on Ukrainian terms. The Russian Federation must leave the entire territory of Ukraine.\n\nSome nice aid announced: 287 more Aim-7 missiles (for the F-16s and possibly F-18s but possibly for some of the SAM systems as well) and 10,000 155mm shells.  Plus handing over an An-124 Transport seized by the CAD govt.\n\nI as a CAD taxpayer am glad we are constantly stepping up to assist Ukraine.  I have many family that fought against the Nazi's in WW2 and now we have to assist Ukraine in fighting another set of Nazis this time coming from Russia.  IMHO a superb use of our tax dollars and I think we should be rapidly increasing our aid.  Ship over some LAVs and give them a squadron of our F-18s, that would be putting these assets to their intended use.",

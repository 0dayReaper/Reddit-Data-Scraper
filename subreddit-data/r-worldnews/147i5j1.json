                    "comment": "We are getting in full digital authoritarianism mode, one month ago they passed a law to allow algorithmic video surveillance :\n\nhttps://www.laquadrature.net/en/2023/03/29/france-becomes-the-first-european-country-to-legalize-biometric-surveillance/\n\nhttps://www.brusselstimes.com/430820/all-out-assault-on-privacy-france-is-first-eu-country-to-legalise-ai-driven-surveillance\n\n2 months ago a law to generalize the use of drones in public events/protests. Now each protests, even concerts or peaceful gatherings are monitored by drones.\n\nNext law is something about \"*protecting* the digital space\" : using encrypted messaging apps, Tor browser could be used to criminalize activists based on anti-terrorist laws. \n\nExample (it shows that if they want to legalize it, that means they already are using it) :\n\nhttps://www.laquadrature.net/en/2023/06/05/criminalization-of-encryption-the-8-december-case/\n\n&gt;We are facing the fantasy of a State demanding total transparency from everyone at the risk of being called a \u201csuspect\u201d, a State whose desire for widespread surveillance seems limitless. In this context, we reaffirm our rights to privacy, intimacy and the protection of our personal data. Encryption is, and will remain, an essential element of our civil liberties in the digital age.\n\n&gt;This case is a trial for the Ministry of Interior, which aims to normalise this framing for repressive purposes. During a Senate hearing that followed the violent repression of protests in Sainte-Soline [environmental protests severely repressed that happened in France in 2023], G\u00e9rald Darmanin, the French Minister of Interior, implored the legislature to change the law so that it would be possible to hack into demonstrators\u2019 mobile phones, especially those using\u00a0\u201cSignal, WhatsApp, Telegram\u201d: \u201cGive us the same means for extreme violence as for terrorism\u201d. His justification was that\u00a0\u201cthere is a very strong, advanced paranoia in ultra-left circles [\u2026] who use encrypted messaging\u201d, which can be explained by a \u201cclandestine culture\u201d. In an attempt to demonstrate the supposed violence of Sainte-Soline activists, he also cited the 8 December affair as an example of a\u00a0\u201cfoiled attack\u201d\u00a0by the\u00a0\u201cultra-left\u201d, in defiance of any presumption of innocence. \n\n&gt;This is how the criminalisation of digital practices fits in with the French government\u2019s strategy of repressing all social protests. Reaffirming the right to encryption therefore means opposing the authoritarian abuses of the government that seeks to endlessly extend the scope of \u201ccounter-terrorism\u201d policies by designating an ever-growing number of domestic enemies24. After the repression of Muslims, now it\u2019s the turn of \u201ceco-terrorists\u201d, \u201cintellectual terrorists\u201d and finally, geeks armed with encrypted messaging systems. Faced with such a situation, the only question left seems to be:\u00a0\u201cAnd you, what kind of terrorist are you?\n\nSorry for my broken english btw",

In this substance, there is also a synthetic DNA, a DNA specific to each marble and which can remain for years on the clothes.

Because what we're seeing now is a direct consequence of what happened close to 65 years ago. \n\nThat strong civic nationalism stems from the 1789 revolution and the subsequent wars. For all the 1800s France was kinda alone against everyone in Europe, we were a democracy, most were still monarchies. We French are proud people, all of us grew up learning our history, how we are the \"Country of the rights of Man\", how in 39-45 many resisted the occupation and such, we've been taught to respect the Republic and it's values. \n\nWhat we're not being taught (or rather it's glanced over, although to be fair the history program in French is quite packed), is how our current republic (the fifth one) was created after a military coup !!\n\nSome French officers, unhappy with all that was happening (decolonization and the war in Algery), did a coup in 1958 and propped the General de Gaulle as head of the new fifth republic. \n\nThe fact that this coup was bloodless and that Charles de Gaulle had apparently really nothing to do with it appart from being an all around really popular guy after WW2, combined with the previously strong civic nationalism are probably why the fa\u00e7ade was kept up for so long. \nBut just like the US, we've finally had a president that doesn't care about implicit \"rules\" like \"hey you have this power but you won't abuse it right ?\". \n\nBut now we're finally being reminded that our republic was created when unhappy soldiers forced their general buddy to become leader. \n\nOver the recent years i've grown more and more convinced that our Republic need to change, we need a sixth one.",

Concerning Matignon, in particular.\nThey hadn't seen each other since that horrible day in May 2023. Nicolas Sarkozy was sentenced to one year's imprisonment and three years' loss of civil rights in the \"wiretapping\" affair. As soon as the verdict was delivered, the former president, who is appealing to the French Supreme Court, received several expressions of support. He was particularly touched by the friendly words of the Macron couple. Since day one, this strange president, whom he doesn't fully understand, has shown him elegance. At regular intervals, Emmanuel Macron invites him to his table at the Elys\u00e9e Palace. He probes the \"disrupter\" in chief that is Nicolas Sarkozy. Occasionally, too, the current head of state asks the former to act as his emissary abroad. Admiration and curiosity are shared. But that doesn't stop the Ex from predicting, at even more regular intervals than his visits to the Elys\u00e9e Palace, that \"all this will end badly\".\n\nhttps://www.lexpress.fr/politique/exclusif-remaniement-macron-sarkozy-le-rendez-vous-secret-NP6CETK23FHI5CYYV5QC5C2EIM/",

It was a social commentary on the then-present and recent past.

The events and ideas that were happening that caused Orwell\u2019s inspirations and notes are not unique to the modern era, or to the period 40 years ago near when the book is ostensibly set. Any predictive aspects of 1984 are purely because the same patterns of behavior can be examined repeatedly occurring with just changes of setting.\n\nVery little of 1984 needs to be changed to make is about post-1789 France honestly.

With good reason.\n\nIn the midst of provisions aimed at ratifying, in no particular order, the remote intervention of doctors in the event of prolongation of police custody, and of interpreters from the outset of police custody, or the extension of the possibilities of night-time searches to common crimes, a new investigative tool has been created, enabling the remote activation of a person's electronic devices without his or her knowledge, in order to obtain real-time geolocation or capture images and sounds. Art. 3 points 12\u00b0 and 13\u00b0 and 17\u00b0 to 19\u00b0.\n\nIn plain English, this means, for example, that forensic investigators will be able to geolocate a car in real time from its computer system, to listen in and record everything that is said around the microphone of a telephone even if there is no call in progress, or to activate a computer camera to film what is in the field of view, even if it is not switched on by its owner. Technically, police officers will exploit security loopholes in these devices (notably, if they are not updated when accessed, or remotely) to install software that allows them to take control and turn your tools, those of your loved ones or various locations into bugs.\n\nTo justify these serious invasions of privacy, the Ministry of Justice invokes the \"fear of attracting the attention of delinquents under investigation for organized crime, of revealing the established strategy or quite simply because it would expose the lives of the agents in charge of this mission\" by installing investigative tools. In short, it would be too risky or complicated for officers to install \"physical\" microphones and beacons, so they might as well use all the connected objects that exist. However, this alleged risk is not supported by any serious information or specific examples. Above all, it's important to bear in mind that device hacking will continue to rely heavily on physical access (which is technically simpler), and that the risk of hacking will continue to grow.\n\nThis means that agents will always be exposed to this so-called \"field risk\". What's more, the material limits imposed by the installation of a device constitute a necessary safeguard against massive invasions of privacy.\n\nThe measure provided for in Article 3 is particularly problematic for cell phones and computers, given the extent to which they are part of our lives. But the danger doesn't stop there, since the scope of the measure actually covers all \"electronic devices\", i.e. all digital objects equipped with a microphone, camera or location sensors. This investigative measure could thus make it possible to :\n\n\"sound\", i.e. listen to spaces from a connected TV, a baby monitor, a voice assistant (such as Google Home), or a microphone built into a car;\nretransmit images and videos from a laptop camera, smartphone or motion-detection security camera;\nretrieve a person's location from the GPS positioning of a car, connected scooter or connected watch. Many other devices equipped with these sensors could also be hacked.\nIf this text were to be definitively adopted, it would dangerously increase the possibilities for police intrusion, turning all our IT tools into potential spies.\n\nIn this respect, it is particularly worrying to see the State's right to use security flaws in the software or hardware in use enshrined in law, rather than endeavoring to protect them by informing users of the existence of such flaws and taking steps to remedy them.\n\nHowever, police and intelligence services already have extremely intrusive tools at their disposal: installation of bugs in homes or cars (GPS beacons, video surveillance cameras, public address microphones), extraction of information from a computer or telephone, for example, and the use of screen or keystroke recorders (keyloggers). These very wide-ranging possibilities, which are particularly invasive of privacy, are already being misused to monitor activists such as (in the Carnet struggle, in opposition to megabassines, in militant locations in Dijon, or in the photocopiers of anarchist locations, etc.)",

Technically, police officers will exploit security loopholes in these devices (notably, if they are not updated when accessed, or remotely) to install software that allows them to take control and turn your tools, those of your loved ones or various locations into bugs.\n\n&gt;As far as the geolocation of connected objects is concerned, the spectrum is even wider, since remote activation could concern any person *suspected* of having committed an offence punishable by up to five years' imprisonment, which - due to the penal inflation of successive laws - could range, for example, from simple concealment, to the transmission of a false document to a public administration, or the unauthorized downloading of documents from a computer system.",

Some other surveillance vectors:  computers and laptops, smart TVs, Internet-connected entertainment systems, security cameras, vehicles, and so on.   That's just the digital domain.   In the analog world there are a whole host of ways to use something like a stereo system for surveillance purposes.  First, given physical access it is relatively trivial to replace a board-level component with a replacement that happens also to contain a microphone and transmitter.  For all practical purposes such a device would be virtually undetectable  Less sophisticated bugs can also be installed in electrical equipment.  I think it is also likely that an audio amplifier designed to use negative feedback can broadcast a signal that subtracts the audio program from incident sound impinging on a loudspeaker.  That's just a phenomenon of stray EM normally emitted by electronics, similar to how a radar-detector-detector works.  This hypothetical mode of surveillance does not require physical access to affected equipment.  Then we get into forgettable things like the AC outlets all over your home.  It isn't rocket science to replace one or more of them with a functional substitute containing a microphone and transmitter.\n\nThis discussion can continue with the risk of consumer goods like children's toys, etc. that could be manufactured with Big Brother Inside.\n\nRemember that intelligence agencies have had more than a hundred years of electronics development to leverage in their favor.  It was common years ago to assume that the NSA was decades ahead of the civilian sector with respect to technology.   The risks of this sort of thing cannot be understated.",

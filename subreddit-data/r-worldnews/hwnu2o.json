One of the best things Jacinda did during this was listening to the experts and make sure that their info was conveyed clearly, calmly and often. 1 pm broadcasts every day where she and Dr. Bloomfield would answer questions and give updates on the situation: how many cases were found today and where, what our running total was, updates on how businesses would be affected, etc. She deferred to Bloomfield for the medical questions because she knows he's the expert on those. She handled the press gracefully and took their questions (even the stupid ones \\*cough Tova\\*). When I look at Boris, Donald, and Scomo I feel very very grateful to live here with Jacinda as PM. She really is a great example of what a compassionate, intelligent leader looks like.",

I am ashamed of my leaders who have cast doubt and encouraged dissidence against a fucking mask that is only uncomfortable and sometimes hot. I work at a fucking grocery store, busting my ass pulling pallets of water, filling heavy shit, pulling carts of canned goods, sweating my fucking dick off in NORMAL circumstances. \n\nNow I have to wear a mask. And I fucking do, and I'm happy to. Know why I'm happy to? I've literally done the math and on an **average** day, I'm exposed to approximately 4000 people. FOUR THOUSAND. \n\nGranted, some never make it to my side of the store or the aisle I'm on. But I take breaks. Those breaks are often in the tiny fucking break room with between two and twelve other employees, usually from allw departments in the store. \n\nIf I get exposed, I would absolutely expose all those co workers. Meaning that no department of my store would not get exposed. Meaning that 4000+ people a day would get exposed. After doing a little digging on the unique customers per day (because there is a significant portion of customers I see every day, or almost evey other day) thats still almost 15,000 people a week.\n\n\nBut yeah, Karen, fucking yell at me and call me a sheep for wearing a mask and yell at me about YOUR rights while you get in my face to do so, putting myself at risk.",

For NZ citizens, that quarantine is paid for, the very few business travellers arriving seem to be paying their own stays. \n\nPeople in managed-isolation get tested around Day 3 &amp; Day 12 of their stay, and positive cases get moved to quarantine hotels. You can refuse a test, but then you'll be made to stay in the isolation facility for another 14 days (assuming no symptoms).\n\nThere's been no international tourism since March (which was our biggest export industry).

Thanks Noooooooooooobus. \n\nEssentially anyone entering the country is in compulsory quarentine for 2 weeks and must return a negative result before they leave. Quarentine facilities are nominated hotels that are managed by the defence force and quarentine laws are enforced by the police. Its not 100% perfect, but pretty damn close to it.\nQuarentine is mostly for returning kiwis, but I have heard of a few scenarios where tourists have been allowed in for economy boosting activities such as filming Avatar 2. So above is not too far off in fairness.",

If the leaders will trust doctors and scientists and pass on the information then we can trust the leaders. \n\nScience has no agenda when they say with nearly 100% consensus:\n- distance as much as possible, stay home\n- if you go out stay 6 feet apart\n- wash your hands many times per day at home and if you touch anything not from inside your house.\n- wash your hands scrubbing for at least 30 seconds with soap.\n- wear a mask when you leave your house particularly in public places like stores and malls. (Masks prevent the potential spread of the virus by stopping spit and snott from flying around the room landing on surfaces that we touch or other people's clothing and faces. There is some evidence that actual breath vapor breathing other people's air can also transit the virus in some cases, but this has not reached consensus yet as there has not been enough evidence to be conclusive. But even if it is not in the air it is in spit and snott so wear your mask)\n\n\nIf the leaders are passing on info from doctors and scientists, then listen to the leaders. \n\nIf the leaders are not passing on info from doctors and scientists, then forget the leaders and listen to the scientists yourself. \n\nEither way you have the same information from people who have no interest other than passing on their research findings so it can save lives.",

The rugged individual thing works great right up until the day you're diagnosed with cancer, hit by a car, have a child with a disability, have your house destroyed by a tornado, etc. etc.  I think a lot of people live in denial, or they sort of vaguely believe that if they're a good person and make good choices, nothing bad will happen to them.  I know so many good people who were just going along with their lives, and oops, they had a hole in their heart they never knew about and had a massive stroke at 40.  Diagnosed with a super rare, random cancer.  Broke neck vertebrae in a car accident.  Lost their home in the Santa Rosa fire (all of these are different people, btw).  No one gets out of this world alive, and very very few aren't touched by tragedy at one point or another.  Maybe today it's not you, but it might be tomorrow, and trust me you'll be glad of that safety net you so disparaged when it happens.",

Even if we drop it down to a 1/100th (keeping in mind that anything less that 1/10th a wavelength is functionally useless for reception; never mind transmission)  we're still at .112 inches; which yes is small, but in your blood, that shit might as well be the titanic.  Never mind that they would easily stick together to cause massive nanobot clots since there is no functional way to make such a machine be able to counteract the flow of blood.  Then we get to the issue of this titanic, non degradable, nanobot mass having to transmit with enough power to overcome a functionally 0% efficiency antenna that is permanently grounded at every possible point because humans are conductive, and that then has to travel through the skin.\n\nSorry, I had typed this response hours ago to someone, and I liked it, so figured I'd share it because now the chips are apparently the real reason for 5G.

I made eye contact and I will not deny that I was tempted to call her out. She returned my steely gaze and it felt obvious that she was positively thirsting at the prospect of some confrontation.\n\nI went to the store for some beers and snacks. Not some bizzarre confrontation over a ridiculously trivial issue. I just kept my distance and silently waited for her to exit the store. The old me would have made a stand against that idiocy. Today me just feels tired and scared.",

I think it was one of the most effective things to be honest, because not only were they very clear, but they were daily. They kept people informed and they were a daily reminder of what we were *all* having to go through, for the good of everybody.\n\nThey were based wholly on science and not opinion. They were regular and designed to keep everyone informed, not to politicise the pandemic or pass the buck.\n\nIt also helps that those who flouted the rules were punished, including [members of the government](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12322103).\n\nIt was a model of consistency and clarity, and we're all the better for it. I dread to think what it would have been like under a National leadership. Just goes to show what a difference an actual strong leader can make, rather than a weak leader constantly claiming to be a strong one.\n\nI may be an immigrant to NZ but I have a huge amount of respect for the current government, so much more so than my native country's current absurd populist parade.\n\nThe US response has been so much of a joke that it's almost impossible to believe, honestly. Really shone a light on the utter lack of meaningful leadership. It did not need to be this way.",

Even they are impressed and have confidence in the current government, even if they don't agree on all their policies. But at least now they are willing to understand Labour's position, rather than just blindly voting for National.",

Those in #2 are the worst of the worst. Self centred, back stabbing, power hungry, etc. Then they develop an air of self entitlement (eg. Bronwyn Bishop, I'm looking at you) and rort public monies through exaggerated expense claims for one. \nMy view on politics is this: we're all in a longboat and we need people to row and steer. Rowers are the pollies, the PM will steer and you get extra rations for doing it vs us peasants. Once you get tired of rowing, step out and let the next person take over but you lose your rations....don't then sit back, let everyone else row harder why you claim your rations. \n\nBad analogy I know but all i could come up with.

School was also 'closed indefinitely until further notice' on a national scale around this time. In general, we consider every gov department (apart from the police, which is a major exception) to be trustworthy, especially with the new Chairman of the Party who is quite popular with the people.\n\nWe also have collective effort from the military as well. They cleared out multiple barracks and repurposed them into quarantine facilities with cooking facilities set up, AC installed and are staffed by the soldiers, such that we don't have to rely on hotels for quarantine and the cases can be easily monitored. Escaping from quarantine facility or dodging quarantine with legal loopholes was considered borderline treason (there was a big scandal of a big wig Karen using her dual citizenship passport to dodge airport security and avoid quarantine, and she was charged with heavy jail time after quarantine).\n\nApart from these, things like free public healthcare and people' generosity (making and donating fresh food to the quarantined area, free mask distribution) made the 4 week of total national lockdown a bit easier for everyone",

Plus having Dr Ashley Bloomfield as the go between has worked amazingly well (he deserves to be knighted). We are not a perfect country and we still have political scandals and things.

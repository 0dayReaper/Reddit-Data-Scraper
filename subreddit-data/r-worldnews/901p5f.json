He is basically only looking out for his wallet and his own ass.\n\nHe has praised dictators and put Putin on a pedestal above all else.\n\nHe has unethically benefited from a business standpoint by having the government spend millions at his hotels. \n\nHe has refused to demonstrate sympathy when a tragic shooting occurs.\n\nHe has mocked gold star families.\n\nHe goes on tirades on Twitter.\n\nHe fabricates \"facts\" (like the ones related to the Queen) to make himself seem better.\n\nHe had a scandal with a porn star.\n\nHe has literally been caught saying grab em by the pussy (and said some incestuous stuff about his daughter).\n\nHe constantly attacks the Constitution of Free Speech by calling various journalism \"Fake News\". \n\nHe has ruined our relationships with previous allies.\n\nHe tried to start a trade war.\n\nHis tax cuts only helped large corporations and he defended the cuts by saying the employees would benefit when in reality the tax cuts stimulated buybacks of stock.\n\nFor the love of God I don't understand how people don't understand that he is not on par with all of the proper presidents we have had in the past. Trump is a stain on the legacy of presidents we have. If he has been capable of all this why do people think it's not possible that he is colluding with Russia or at the very least that he is obstructing Mueller from his investigation? ",

            "comment": "&gt;In July 2017, just after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time, Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that the Russian president had made a persuasive case that Moscow\u2019s cyberskills were so good that the government\u2019s hackers would never have been caught. Therefore, Mr. Trump recounted from his conversation with Mr. Putin, Russia must not have been responsible.\n\nIf anyone thinks for a second that Putin, with complete confidence that he wouldn't get caught, wouldn't penetrate America's cyber defenses then they need to seriously examine their logic.",

Any time there's an introduction of a revolutionary technology there are pitfalls. Misinformation is simply the downside of the internet revolution but before we as a society learned to understand and mitigate it. \n\nFor example, you couldn't get into a 30mph+ accident before cars came along. Then you could. But even after that, there were decades where cars went well over 30mph and it was just accepted that a cars will have high speed accidents and kill people. It wasn't until the 1950ish that safety features were even thought about. Crumple zones, seat belts, collapsible steering columns. Then it took another 30 years until the 80s for it to be implimented as law into all vehicles.\n\nMisinformation is the car crashes of the internet and we are at a time when we accept that access to information will naturally come with access to misinformation and scams. One day we will mitigate and regulate misinformation. The Trump era will be seen as a catalyst for that and our grandkids will look back and go \"I can't believe they just let that happen back then.\"",

Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg\n\nJuly 19, 2018\n\nJames B. Comey, James R. Clapper Jr. and John O. Brennan at a Senate hearing on Russia\u2019s election interference in January 2017.CreditAl Drago/The New York Times\n\nBy\u00a0David E. Sanger\u00a0and\u00a0Matthew Rosenberg\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.\n\nThe evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.\n\nMr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.\n\nThe shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week.\n\nOn Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.\n\nOn Wednesday, when a reporter asked, \u201cIs Russia still targeting the U.S.?\u201d Mr. Trump shot back, \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)\n\nHours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, \u201cbecause he\u2019s in charge of the country.\u201d\n\nIn the run-up to this week\u2019s ducking and weaving, Mr. Trump has done all he can to suggest other possible explanations for the hacks into the American political system. His fear, according to one of his closest aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that any admission of even an unsuccessful Russian attempt to influence the 2016 vote raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency.\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2017, meeting, held at Trump Tower, was a prime example. He was briefed that day by John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command.\n\nThe F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was also there; after the formal briefing, he privately told Mr. Trump about the \u201cSteele dossier.\u201d That report, by a former British intelligence officer, included uncorroborated salacious stories of Mr. Trump\u2019s activities during a visit to Moscow, which he denied.\n\nAccording to nearly a dozen people who either attended the meeting with the president-elect or were later briefed on it, the four primary intelligence officials described the streams of intelligence that convinced them of Mr. Putin\u2019s role in the election interference.\n\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, the day he was briefed on cyberattacks designed to sway the 2016 American election.CreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times\n\nThey included stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been seen in Russian military intelligence networks by the British, Dutch and American intelligence services. Officers of the\u00a0Russian intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U.\u00a0had plotted with groups like WikiLeaks on how to release the email stash.\n\nAnd ultimately, several human sources had confirmed Mr. Putin\u2019s own role.\n\nThat included one particularly valuable source, who was considered so sensitive that Mr. Brennan had declined to refer to it in any way in the Presidential Daily Brief during the final months of the Obama administration, as the Russia investigation intensified.\n\nInstead, to keep the information from being shared widely, Mr. Brennan sent reports from the source to Mr. Obama and a small group of top national security aides in a separate, white envelope to assure its security.\n\nMr. Trump and his aides were also given other reasons during the briefing to believe that Russia was behind the D.N.C. hacks.\n\nThe same Russian groups had been involved in cyberattacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems in 2014 and 2015, and in an attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had aggressively fought the N.S.A. against being ejected from the White House system, engaging in what the deputy director of the agency later called \u201chand-to-hand combat\u201d to dig in.\n\nThe pattern of the D.N.C. hacks, and the theft of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, fit the same pattern.\n\nAfter the briefings, Mr. Trump issued a statement later that day that sought to spread the blame for the meddling. He said \u201cRussia, China and other countries, outside groups and countries\u201d were launching cyberattacks against American government, businesses and political organizations \u2014 including the D.N.C.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump said in his statement, \u201cthere was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.\u201d\n\nMr. Brennan later told Congress that he had no doubt where the attacks were coming from.\n\n\u201cI was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election,\u201d he said in testimony in May 2017. \u201cAnd they were very aggressive.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the messengers were as much a part of the problem as the message they delivered.\n\nMr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper were both Obama administration appointees who left the government the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated. The new president soon took to portraying them as political hacks who had warped the intelligence to provide Democrats with an excuse for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss in the election.\n\nMr. Comey fared little better. He was fired in May 2017 after refusing to pledge his loyalty to Mr. Trump and pushing forward on the federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign had cooperated with Russia\u2019s election interference.\n\nOnly Admiral Rogers, who retired this past May, was extended in office by Mr. Trump. (He, too, told Congress that he thought the evidence of Russian interference was incontrovertible.)\n\nPresident Trump, meeting with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, said he accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of Russian election intrusions.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times\n\nAnd the evidence suggests Russia continues to be very aggressive in its meddling.\n\nIn March, the Department of Homeland Security\u00a0declared that Russia was\u00a0targeting the American electric power grid, continuing to riddle it with malware that could be used to manipulate or shut down critical control systems. Intelligence officials have described it to Congress as a chief threat to American security.\n\nJust last week, Mr. Coats said that current cyberthreats were \u201cblinking red\u201d and called Russia the \u201cmost aggressive foreign actor, no question.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nChristopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, also stood firm.\n\n\u201cThe intelligence community\u2019s assessment has not changed,\u201d Mr. Wray said on Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum. \u201cMy view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.\u201d\n\nThe Russian efforts are \u201caimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in this country,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet seen an effort to target specific election infrastructure this time. We could be just a moment away from the next level.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a threat we need to take extremely seriously and respond to with fierce determination and focus.\u201d\n\nAlmost as soon as he took office, Mr. Trump began casting doubts on the intelligence on Russia\u2019s election interference, though never taking issue with its specifics.\n\nHe dismissed it broadly as a fabrication by Democrats and part of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him. He raised unrelated issues, including the state of investigations into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s home computer server, to distract attention from the central question of Russia\u2019s role \u2014 and who, if anyone, in Mr. Trump\u2019s immediate orbit may have worked with them.\n\nIn July 2017, just after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time, Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that the Russian president had made a persuasive case that Moscow\u2019s cyberskills were so good that the government\u2019s hackers would never have been caught. Therefore, Mr. Trump recounted from his conversation with Mr. Putin, Russia must not have been responsible.\n\nSince then, Mr. Trump has routinely disparaged the intelligence about the Russian election interference. Under public pressure \u2014 as he was after his statements in Helsinki on Monday \u2014 he has periodically retreated. But even then, he has expressed confidence in his intelligence briefers, not in the content of their findings.\n\nThat is what happened again this week, twice.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s statement in Helsinki led Mr. Coats to reaffirm, in a statement he deliberately did not get cleared at the White House, that American intelligence agencies had no doubt that Russia was behind the 2016 hack.\n\nThat contributed to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision on Tuesday to say that he had misspoken one word, and that he did believe Russia had interfered \u2014 although he also veered off script to declare: \u201cCould be other people also. A lot of people out there.\u201d\n\n",

Donald Trump's pathology is a result of the life he's led. He has been this way for decades, not just since his birtherism started (though, since that's when so much of the political press first paid attention to him, they often unduly and irritatingly behave as if that is the beginning of his history).  \n\n\nThis is what happens to a human being when the first time they are expected to truly confront their own failings occurs when they are 72 years old... those failings become the largest parts of their personality and they have absolutely no hope for ever being able to cope with them or even begin to gain perspective on them. He cannot believe he is expected to behave differently, he cannot even understand that he is expected to behave differently, or that he could ever be held to account. The degree to which he is absolutely stunted as a human being is the real underlying cause of his behavior.",

Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.**\n&gt; \n&gt; **The evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin,** who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Mr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced**, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own **intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.**\n\nTrump has known since 14 days before his Inauguration that Vladimir Putin personally ordered the attacks on our elections. He has obfuscated and denied and covered for Putin for 558 days.\n\nAnd Trump still has yet to directly state that Putin ordered the attack. The closest he has come is saying that Putin would be responsible as leader of his country (as covered in the article).\n\nThis is watershed. Trump is failing to serve America's best interest, and this behavior alone should rise to being an impeachable defense. No previous President in history would have survived aiding a foreign power in this way. \n\n**But this story is no longer about Trump. It's about the treasonous lack of spine by the Republican Party to act in the face of an attack by Russia, and a President who has become a clear and present danger to the United States.**",

It should be, especially thinking over the past 10 years. But it's harrowing that you can have blatant treason and it's still not enough for Republicans to put country over party.",

If a candidate running for president was truly unfit and they felt the need, members of the electoral college were not required to vote the way the citizens did. What we got in the elections were several electoral college voters who came to exactly that conclusion and then resigned so someone else could cast the vote for him instead.\n\nUpdate after research: Two resigned before the election - one in Texas and one in Georgia. There were also a number of vote defectors on both sides (though more defected from Clinton than Trump) when the actual electoral vote was held.\n\n[[***Source***]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faithless_electors_in_the_United_States_presidential_election,_2016)",

They discussed the Magnistky Act. One operative has ties to Russian intelligence and has been accused of hacking.**\n\nOne of the Russian operatives, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is an outspoken opponent of the Magnitsky Act.^[[8]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html) Trump Jr. admitted to discussing adoptions, which means they discussed Russian sanctions. Moreover, in 2017 at the G20 summit Putin and Trump discussed adoptions and the Magnitsky Act.^[[9]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40673583) The other Russian operative present at the infamous Trump Tower meeting, Rinat Akhmetshin, has ties to Russian intelligence and has a history of being embroiled in  court cases related to hacking campaigns.^[[10]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/us/rinat-akhmetshin-russia-trump-meeting.html?referer=)\n\n&gt;He has an association with a former deputy head of a Russian spy service, the F.S.B., and a history of working for close allies of President Vladimir V. Putin. Twice, he has worked on legal battles for Russian tycoons whose opponents suffered sophisticated hacking attacks, arousing allegations of computer espionage.\n\n&gt;The Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 took place less than a week before revelations that hackers had penetrated the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computers and obtained a trove of emails. Investigators have traced digital espionage to Russian spy agencies. \n\n&gt;During the same period that Mr. Akhmetshin was accused of being involved in various hacking schemes, he appears to have been nurturing a relationship with Viktor Ivanov, once the deputy head of Russia\u2019s intelligence service, the F.S.B., and until last year a top aide to Mr. Putin.\n\n**July 27, 2016 Candidate Trump looked directly at the camera and publicly asked Russia for their help to find Hillary Clinton's missing emails, the Russian military intelligence (GRU) hacked Clinton thereafter.**\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Florida on July 27, 2016, President Trump called on Russia to help him find Hillary Clinton's missing 30,000 emails.^[[11]](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html) Special Counsel Mueller's new indictment against 12 Russian Intelligence Officers found that on July 27, 2016 Russian hackers known as Guccifer 2.0 hacked Hillary Clinton's emails.^[[12]](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download)\n\n*DoJ Indictment of 12 Russian Intelligence Officers Pg. 7 - 8*\n\n&gt;The Conspirators spearphished individuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign throughout the summer of 2016. For example, on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators attempted after hours to spearphish for the first time email accounts at a domain hosted by a thirdparty provider and used by Clinton\u2019s personal office. At or around the same time, they also targeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign. \n\n**August 22, 2017 Senate Intelligence Committee Testimony that the Trump campaign accepted regular intelligence from the Kremlin during the 2016 campaign**\n\nThe Senate Judiciary committee testimony of Fusion GPS CEO Glenn Simpson confirms that the Trump campaign likely received foreign intelligence aid during the 2016 campaign.^[[13]](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/9/3974a291-ddbe-4525-9ed1-22bab43c05ae/934A3562824CACA7BB4D915E97709D2F.simpson-transcript-redacted.pdf)\n\n*Pg. 154 - 155 Senate Judiciary Committee Testimony*\n\n&gt;A. I mean, one of the key lines here in the second paragraph says \"However, he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his democratic and other political rivals.\" So the issue with the Trump Tower meeting, as 1 I understand it, is that the Trump people were eager to accept intelligence from a foreign government about their political rivals and that is, you know, I would say, a form of interference. If you're getting help from a foreign government and your help is intelligence, then the foreign government's interfering. I mean, you know, I think that also -- of course, in retrospect we now know this was pretty right on target in terms on what it says. So anyway --\n\n&gt;Q. In reference to you think that particular sentence?\n\n&gt;A. I mean, it clearly refers to, you know, them being interested in and willing to -- it depicts them as accepting information. What we have seen to date with the disclosures this year is they were at a minimum super interested in getting information.\n\n&gt;Q. And when you're referencing the \"disclosures this year,\" could you just be specific about that.\n\n&gt;A. The Trump Tower meeting.\n\n&gt;Q. So with reference to the June 9th Trump Tower meeting?\n\n&gt;A. Yes. Yes.\n\n_______________________________\n\n1) [Washington Post - The Magnitsky Act, explained](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/07/14/the-magnitsky-act-explained/?utm_term=.0f0d17c7dfc2)\n\n2) [The Atlantic - Why Does the Kremlin Care So Much About the Magnitsky Act?](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/magnitsky-act-kremlin/535044/)\n\n3) [Politico - The Putin Obsession That Led to Trump Jr.\u2019s Meeting](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/13/the-putin-obsession-that-led-to-trump-jrs-meeting-215374)\n\n4) [New York Times - Talking Points Brought to Trump Tower Meeting Were Shared With Kremlin](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/us/politics/trump-tower-veselnitskaya-russia.html)\n\n5) [CSPAN - Browder Senate Judiciary Testimony](https://www.c-span.org/video/?431852-1/william-browder-overturning-magnitsky-act-putins-top-priority)\n\n6)  [H.R.6156 - Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/6156)\n\n7) [S.284 - Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/284)\n\n8) [New York Times - Trump Team Met With Lawyer Linked to Kremlin During Campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html)\n\n9) [BBC - Why did Putin talk to Trump about 'adoption'?](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40673583)\n\n10) [New York Times - Lobbyist at Trump Campaign Meeting Has a Web of Russian Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/us/rinat-akhmetshin-russia-trump-meeting.html?referer=)\n\n11) [New York Times - Donald Trump Calls on Russia to Find Hillary Clinton\u2019s Missing Emails, *July 28, 2016*](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html)\n\n12) [Justice Department indictment of 12 Russian Intelligence Officers](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download)\n\n13) [Senate Judiciary Committee - Glenn Simpson Fusion GPS CEO Testimony](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/9/3974a291-ddbe-4525-9ed1-22bab43c05ae/934A3562824CACA7BB4D915E97709D2F.simpson-transcript-redacted.pdf)",

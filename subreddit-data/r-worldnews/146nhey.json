It allows us to timeshift renewable energy by a factor of months, and is a fundamental underpinning of the renewables model.\n\nAlso, we need to produce about 100 million tonnes of the stuff every single year (and climbing) just for industrial use, let alone energy storage, and we need to stop using 400m tonnes of natural gas to achieve that task as we do at the moment.",

At night they pump water into a reservoir on top of the hill, then during peak hours they run the water down the hill to generate electricity.  It uses more power than it generates, but it's profitable because it stores energy during off peak hours and releases during peak hours.",

That means during summers you have vast capacity unused. (This is why France exports energy during summer and imports during winter in general.)\n\nSo instead of building another powerplant (nuclear or whatever) to supply energy for 1 week during the year, instead you can build hydrogen production plants that can quickly adapt to the available surplus energy and store it for you to use up in winter. The energy cost then is essentially zero and the only question is how much the infrastructure costs.",

Yeah, we're destroying the planet. :D\n\nI know my stuff. Hydrogen is just very expensive to produce. It's not very expensive, because we dont know how to do it well. It's expensive, because it takes a lot of energy to produce it. That ist just physics and is not changeable.\n\nFor example you need a fixed amount of energy to heat your home a few degrees. You can come up with clever efficient ways to heat your home, but you will never reduce the fixed amount of energy that is needed.\n\nSame with the production of hydrogen.\nHydrogen will always be the champagne of energy forms. It will be heavily used, but for flying or steel production. We wont be able to produce enough for heating and driving.\n\nGoing electric is the solution. Drive EV, buy a heatpump.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know.",

Not the you, sorry.\n\nAn example for yall is that the speed limit is 35 but if you get a ticket for going less than 5 over the speed limit, you will probably be angry. So the myth system is 35 the operating code is less than 5 over.\n\nThe myth system is we don\u2019t spy on allies, the operating code is we spy on everybody and everybody should spy on us. \n\nThe myth system is russian soldiers and US soldiers don\u2019t wage war. The operating code would point out North Korean jet pilots in the korean war who would start speaking russian on the radio during dogfights, and it would also point out those wagner mercenaries in syria who got smoked by us armed forces.\n\nThe myth system says no corruption. The operating code says you can have a little corruption as a treat.  \n\nOnce you come to understand this dichotomy your understanding of international governance falls into place easily",

Three news people get killed, along with all the soldiers trained in Sweden. Actually the media will probably be reporting on their movements from a distance, so only the soldiers get killed.\n\nIt sucks, but what can you do?",

This is a war zone, both war correspondents and soldiers have been, and will continue to be killed there, but there is no reporting on movements here that will get anybody killed.\n\nNow, will media slip-ups get people killed? probably, but that happens in any war, it probably even happened when all news was word-of-mouth instead of moving at light speed.\n\nEdit: Hopefully they keep Geraldo Rivera out of the country, or maybe Fox can get him embedded with the orks",

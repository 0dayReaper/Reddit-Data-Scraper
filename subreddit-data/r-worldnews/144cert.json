U.S. officials were working to declassify some of the intelligence and share it as early as Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSource: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/khakovka-dam-live-updates-ukraine-russia-blew-up-kherson-rcna87855",

Then the WH proceeded to esswntially say that even if Russia didn't carry out the attack its still their fault because they were illegally occupying it at the time of destruction.\n\nAlso a side not, you dont need to infiltrate a dam to blow it up, a good example is the very famous WW2 dam busting raid carried out by the RAF where pilots skipped bombs off the water into the dam destroying it.",

Preparations went on for over a year, it took special equipment and training, and they still weren't particularly successful. Plus it's a little much to compare a WWII special operation with Ukraininan bombers that aren't even flying and even if they were they don't have the weapons, and even if they did, there were no air raids going on.",

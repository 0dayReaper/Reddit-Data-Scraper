My pasture raised eggs come in a cardboard carton, my fruits and veggies come with no packaging, I plop them in my cart and go on to check out and ask them to skip bagging. They go straight from my cart into an insulated bag in my trunk.\n\nNot trying to make a point to bash farmer's markets, but you don't really have to use bags for the same products at grocery stores. They sit in large pallets for you to pick, there's no rule saying you have to put them in the little white bag, you really don't.",

Zucchinis on a styrofoam tray wrapped in plastic, mushrooms in plastic that makes them go bad quicker, lettuce in plastic clamshells.  Organic produce has even more packaging than conventional, and the farmer's markets are just as bad.  I wish the growing season here was longer, because I hate contributing to it.  Trying to grow and preserve what I can, but ultimately there isn't a good way to avoid it altogether.",

A town 30 mins away has curbside where everybody throws everything in a bag and leaves it. If I go directly to the depot i have to sort my own, which is fine, but its VERY limited as to what can be recycled. Only plastics 5&amp;1 and only if they're hard, for instance. The soft plastic recycling drop off is at a grocery store and only takes grocery bags. Our town recently banned plastic bags (which is good obviously) so this bin is close to obsolete (maybe people who get groceries in other towns might use it?). \n\n\nI always tell my husband that legislation should be implemented where stores can only sell products packaged in such a way that it is recyclable/compostable/reusable in the area it is being sold in. I'm not driving 2.5 hours with my packaging to access a larger depot.",

At that time (4-5 years ago) sustainability was a complete novel thing that was just a side task of one of the buyers. They started hiring a small sustainability team that made quite some local impact.\n\nThough i have to be critical at the set goal. A goal of making all packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable can be abused. Technically almost all plastics are recyclable, therefore it would meet such a requirement. The goal is to **ensure** that the packaging is indeed recycled, reused or composted, which is much harder. \n\nI have worked with many packaging suppliers, they all try this trick of marketing their packaging as recyclable. Which is technically true, but in practice 0% of that packaging would be recycled as there was no return stream set up or no recyclers accepting that material.",

Right now they set up dummy companies in turkey to sell to Russia.\n\nAnother fun story. They had a system that allowed everyone to see inventory. The Ukrainian teams started asking questions of why Russia is still getting shipments, so rather than stop, asus blocked everyone from being able to see where the inventory is going. \n\nSource: I have multiple friends in Taiwan who work at asus and constantly complain about this.

There are genuinely people out there who didn't understand the fact that KMT controlled Taiwan was still performing offensives on mainland China well into the 70s. In a more realistic sense, it remains the first line of containment both militarily and economically against Chinese mainland, this geopolitical reality of the polity of Taiwan hasn't changed for the past 70 years, so this \"peace\" maintained by the US military's presence in East Asia will not make any polity that occupies the Chinese heartland content no matter what political party is ruling it.",

The whole world depends on their production, in all kinds of silicon engineering. Computer hardware, RF technology, power semiconductors, micro controllers, you name it. \n\nThe largest Chinese foundry, SMIC, has a pretty good track record at recruiting former TSMC talent. And these guys then help to develop technology nodes at china\u2018s largest foundry. It is rumored that they had a major influence on getting SMIC\u2018s 7 nm technology to run. Now, 7 nm isn\u2018t state of the art anymore, but it\u2018s still good enough for pretty much anything if you don\u2018t want to compete with the best in the logic department.\n\nTL;DR: China\u2018s largest foundry often successfully recruits Taiwanese semiconductor \nmanufacturing talent to work on their own technology, weakening the \u201asilicon shield\u2018 that makes Taiwan irreplaceable at this point.",

Why isn't MSI under fire for this? They said they're leaving, but they're still inside Russia. Insult to injury, they're taking money but refuse to pay developers like Unwinder that create tools like Afterburner. Then they hide behind the sanction as an excuse. Bullshit they can pull a check, but won't cut one for a single-man development team upholding one of the only functioning MSI branded software.",

And stayed that way. It\u2019s like they put all their R&amp;D money into designing that godawful case and then threw together what components they could scrounge for what little money was left.\n\nI miss my sweet rugged early Acer desktops.",

I don't know to what degree it is true though, considering some hardware is hard to buy now i.e. Cisco hardware. \n\nI mean, in my small city in Eastern Siberia I can buy Dr. Pepper imported from... Poland. The one country reddit is so sure about that hates Russia to the bone. That's just one example of many more to list. Some goods disappeared but majority of it has retained on the shelves. One of my favorite whiskeys is still being imported from Ireland. Don't get me started on how big companies like RUSAL or En+ Group operate and how much they rely on imported equipment made by various western countries. Hell, I've even seen some equipment being directly imported from the US. All of it in the middle of the ongoing conflict.\n\nI am by no means gloating but after all the shitty takes I've read on reddit in the past year, people here need a reality check.",

So there isn't just \"one Taiwanese people. In Taiwanese, this difference is humorously called the \"hanji/hitao\" issue. *hanji* meaning sweet potato (Taiwan is the shape of a sweet potato) and refers to people that were already in Taiwan pre-1945. And hi tao (taro) another type of tuber vegetable that is a part of the Taiwanese diet. The word refers to people that came after WW2. They're both Taiwanese.",

It's a stupid policy take to insist that they must be sanctioned and hostile simply because they are technically a communist state. They pose absolutely no threat to the US. They could be a strategic partnership for military and tourism.\n\nOr we can keep pretending like we have a moral high ground and then get mad when they accept aid from China, or whoever.",

America is literally the cause of all there problems. You can question cubas competency, but it\u2019s ridiculous to say that the wests aggression and sanctions don\u2019t have an extremely significant effect on their prosperity. Saying otherwise is simply being historically illiterate\n\n&gt; Yeah, americans spending billions on Cuba\n\nWhy should Americans be barred from investing, visiting, or trading with Cuba? Why is that a bad thing, why should we make it illegal for Americans to spend their money where they choose? To impoverish Cuba, and make there people suffer?\n\n&gt; 1+ million exiled in Florida that will want a word about this\n\nWhy don\u2019t you have a word with the Cubans living in Cuba right now, instead of an extremely selective group of those who left Cuba on negative terms. Obviously the people who lived during famine, had there property seized, or were politically exiled aren\u2019t going to have a nuanced and good faith opinion on Cuba.",

The whole \"re-skill and re-train\" hypothesis doesn't have much evidence to back it, especially in the West and particularly in the US \"Rust-Belt\". \n\nI've taken master's courses on the subject of inequality, and when it comes to globalization and inequality, one thing is clear: it has outsized wage benefits on the \"global middle class\" like China, India, Brazil, and other emerging countries, while having outsized wage deficits on the \"global upper-middle class\" like lower class Britons, Americans, Canadians, and other developed countries. The common phrasing is that low-skilled workers in these countries have become \"permanent losers\" to globalization - rather than seeing some temporary wage decrease before re-skilling and moving into a different industry, instead they see a decline in wages with no upside. \n\nThere's a lot of factors and models to predict why, but without getting too esoteric: no, Brits DO need those low-skilled jobs, and can't simply move up. That has at least been the observation in every country in the West since the early 1980s.",

Australian here, and as I am sure anybody with a little bit of common sense will realise that will never happen. 3 million people would be over 10% of our current population. We have a housing affordability crisis already as it is, spurred on a lot due to foreign investment in housing from China. Also, we have the highest unemployment rate we have ever seen, and a dire economic forecast. Our government has already said future immigration will be limited to help unemployed Australian's return to work.\n\nThis is as likely to happen as sending them all to the moon. Utterly empty words and promises from BJ. Also, the UK has zero power over Australian politics these days, the UK is basically irrelevant to us. BJ can't tell us to do anything.",

Most rich nationalists appear to be nationalists because that's how you do business and avoid getting into political troubles in China. They hold foreign passports and green cards, do you really believe they love China? It's just good acting, that's all. They'd be the first to betray CCP is CCP collapsed.",

So you have a greater chance encountering some of them in those two countries. Here is why, and I wanna apologize beforehand if I sound offensive.\n\nIt's the college education system. Comparing to US and UK, Canada and Australia has a college system MUCH more favorable to rich Chinese kids who have low intellectual abilities. That makes the two countries a favorable destination for kids of corrupted Chinese officials and business people. These people benefit from the totalitarian system of China because they are the masters in our country, that's why they think China is great and Western countries are bad. If you look at the Chinese students' protests last year, you'd see that almost all those Chinese nationalist protests against HK happened in Canada and Australia. Maybe one in US, and zero in UK.\n\nI'm sure you have a world class college education system, but the admission standard is a problem. Australian universities admit Chinese students based on the Chinese college entrance exam. But the bar is too low. You take Chinese students that barely qualify for college education in China. As a result, retarded Chinese teenagers who are rich but have no independent thinking are pouring into Australia. Same shit is happening in Canada too.",

The vast majority of the cases of plagiarism, essays that were clearly ghost-written or English that was simply unintelligible were from the rich Chinese kids. \n\nWhen bringing these issues up to the main professor, I was told that those kids wouldn't be able to understand the reprimands anyway, and to just give them a marginal pass.\n\nAs someone who worked hard for their degree, I instantly became even more disgusted with the university system.\n\nThat's not to say all Chinese students are cheaters. I remember one guy whom I had suspected of having a ghost-written essay. His first two reports for the course were gibberish, while the final essay was near-perfect. We had a meeting, and it turned out that he had very evidently written the essay himself and had simply been going to writing workshops every evening to improve his English skills. I felt very proud for him.",

The BNO was created specifically for the Hong Kong handover; they wanted to show that they weren't throwing HK to the wolves, but didn't want to pick up the \"burden\" of actually allowing Hong Kongers, their former colonial subjects, to move to the UK. I think it's telling that out of Hong Kong's 1997 population of 6.5 million, only 300,000 of them hold BNO passports. The UK did give a privileged elite the right of abode, but that was a tiny, tiny portion of the population.\n\nI myself would have been eligible for BNO status, as I born in HK a few years before the handover, but my family passed on it. Granted, they probably did so because we were preparing to move to the US, but I doubt they'd have applied for BNO status even if we stayed put.\n\nSo, in my opinion, giving BNOs the right of abode in the UK is a long-overdue correction. Good on Boris Johnson for that, and I don't say that very often. But I think a more meaningful improvement would be to give the right of abode to all pre-handover HK residents and their descendants (and no, I'm not saying that because I want to move to the UK and get that sweet, sweet access to NHS healthcare, though it is very certainly very tempting.)\n\nEdit: I did forget to mention that the deadline to apply for BNO status was the end of 1997 at the latest (registration was done in stages; most people would have had earlier deadlines as a result), which is why Johnson's announcement effectively splits pre-handover Hong Kongers in two.",

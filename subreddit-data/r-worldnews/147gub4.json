[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.",

Letters E and O in location names or words people tend to pronounce anecdotally similar - either both are pronounced with O or E. It is mainly due to quircs of local dialects. Or people don't really bother thqt much with correct pronunciation or remembering words.\n\nIn Zakarpattya there is a headache of dialect/s and speaking habits . There are two distinctly named settlements Rahiv and Dragovo . Looks and sounds different, eh? Hell no. People tend to refer to Rahiv as Rahovo and Dragovo letter G sounds confusing - both as H and G . This makes them sound just a tad bit more similar. \nBut life gets more complicated with some Hungarian/Romanian speaking/influenced groups. They pronounce Rahovo and Dragovo both as Rahovo and you cant really tell if there is swallowed D or not.",

In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all defiantly seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I can't be asked to turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. No need to get upper arms about it. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once like a bowl in a Chinese shop. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and except the orange and nil facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like its a peach of cake.",

While walking the streets I came across what looked like a massive garage sale.  Hundreds of people and big trucks.  All Diapers, toothbrush, food, clothing and bedding.  It was a massive drive to accept donations for those affected.\n\nWhile there and helping, because, why not, I noticed almost half of those pitching in were Syrian refugees new to the country.  I couldn't have been prouder of my country for accepting them and my fellow man for helping out.   Those refugees probably needed the items more but appreciated the perils of being relocated and nearly homeless.  Still gives me tingles thinking about it.\n\nNinja edit due spelling.",

He is saying \u201cyou have a solid friend and ally in Ukraine. Just as you stand with us unwaveringly, we will stand with you steadfastly.\u201d That is a hell of a contrast to Russia and would play very well with international audiences. It is a pretty good position to take.",

It's the Conservative way, its the liberal way, its the NDP way. So why are can't we all be glad?",

This was a learjet that was equipped with a highr esolution infrared camera and other geospatial equipment, and would orbit over the fire and map the extents. It was high enough resolution that it could spot a stump that was still smouldering, allowing a cleanup crew to be dispatched to it if need be.\n\nThe jet would actually do all the fires in the region each night. There\u2019s just no way to do that from orbit.",

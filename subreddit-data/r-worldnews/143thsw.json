You can't have them thinking independently or becoming nihilistic.

So you control them, keep them on task, by give them nonsense structure and the illusion of meaning.\n\nIts pointless work for pointless pay to keep the inertia of the machine moving forward and the cogs from getting ideas.\n\nIt happens in most large, dysfunctional organizations at some level.",

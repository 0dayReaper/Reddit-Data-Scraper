A handful of studies attempted to quickly assess the outcome of these ***new promises***22,23,24,25,26,27, showing that\u2014***if fully implemented***\u2014global climate ambition could hold global temperature rise to just below 2\u2009\u00b0C by 2100. More efforts to comprehend the effect of the new generation of NDCs and ***long-term targets*** (LTTs) followed28,29. Nonetheless, each of these studies was based on a single model and, despite stagnation of such bold promises largely due to the current energy crisis30, a multimodel assessment of global climate pledges remains critical. Our study contributes to this research gap, aiming to enhance robustness and confidence in our knowledge of possible global warming outcomes, by exploiting a diverse ensemble of integrated assessment models (IAMs) and breaking down the climate action gap in an implementation gap (temperature difference between current policies and NDCs), a long-term ratchet gap (temperature difference between NDCs followed or not by LTTs) and a long-term ambition gap (difference between temperature achieved by LTTs and the 1.5\u2009\u00b0C goal) (Fig. 1; \u2018Climate action gap definition\u2019 in Methods).\n\nEmphasis added",

We can\u2019t really even fathom what types of catastrophic effects even at the most conservative warming of 2C will have. And that\u2019s if you take this study at heart. Which is rather difficult to do if you keep up with climate research considering this study relies on current and future climate pledges, and it\u2019s not like the currently implemented policies can\u2019t be reversed, or even just straight up ignored. There\u2019s totaaaally no history of that...\n\nThis study also doesn\u2019t attempt to touch on adaptation challenges for our warming world. That\u2019s a pretty massive factor, the study says so itself. \n\n&gt; The feasibility metrics are only based on mitigation and do not consider the adaptation challenges that are driven by lack of mitigation. *In fact, the feasibility of adequate adaptation to make up for lack of mitigation may be substantially more concerning*\u2014that is, in terms of costs, pace of investment scale-up and land and freshwater availability44,45\u2014but this is outside the scope of this study. \n\nI wish I could say the study changed my long-held opinion that humanity\u2019s reaction to the climate crisis has been (and will continue to be) a horrifying failure. Remember the 1.5C goal? Now it\u2019s 2C, at least according to this. Soon we\u2019ll be lucky to keep it under 2.5C. The goal posts will keep changing as the emissions keep rising.",

Do you understand the implications of 2C of warming, let alone 2.5C?\n\n\u201cAlready implemented climate policies\u201d really doesn\u2019t mean anything. You\u2019re either naive or just haven\u2019t been keeping up with climate news long enough if ya think climate policies are being followed or taken seriously enough. \n\n&gt; The headline climate pledges of 25 of the world\u2019s largest companies in reality only commit to reduce their emissions by 40% on average, not 100% as suggested by their \u201cnet zero\u201d and \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d claims, according to a new analysis.\n\nhttps://newclimate.org/news/press-release-corporate-climate-responsibility-monitor-2022\n\nWe already know companies are doing as little as possible. Now remember when the previous US administration rolled back over 100 environmental policies? Remember the Clean Power Plan? That was a \u201ccurrently implemented climate policy\u201d at the time that would\u2019ve stopped over 400 million tons of emissions by 2030. Keyword being *would\u2019ve*. So I don\u2019t see how you can even think for a second climate policies are set in stone. Especially in this political climate. \n\nOh also, we didn\u2019t go from 4.5C by 2100 to 2.4C through climate policy. We were able to reduce that number by advancements in our understanding of natural systems, leading to better modelling that narrowed the uncertainty.

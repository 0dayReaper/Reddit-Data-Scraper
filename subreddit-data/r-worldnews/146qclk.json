I'm not defending china's authoritarianism or anything, I'm just saying Donald trump did more damage to the image of US stability than most realize. \n\nDonald trumps antagonization of pretty much all of the United States allies and most of our geopolitical rivals/enemies made everyone wake up real quick to the fact that the US is not reliable. Every four years the US runs the risk of electing the human equivalent of a mad lib to the head of state. Hell there were even talks about withdrawing from NATO while he was in office and he still got plenty of votes in the 2020 election. Not exactly the most reassuring thing to our allies.\n\nEven worse, the supporters of Donald trump don't give a shit because they don't really give a shit about anything that happens outside of the US that doesn't immediately and directly impact the US. Most of his supporters are isolationists to an extent. \n\nAnd this is the first comment where I've mentioned trump in years but he is extremely relevant when it comes to the image of the US abroad.\n\nEdit: Donald Trump's presidency also exposed how precarious deals made with one administration are. Everything a nation agreed to and established with one administration can be thrown out the window if the next one doesn't give two shits about diplomacy with our rivals/enemies or maintaining good relations with our allies.",

Case in point is Russia - they are attacking Ukraine but have been told publicly and privately by everyone (USA/CHina/UK/EU/etc etc) that the use of a Nuclear weapon with see a very harsh response - they would be world outcasts.\n\nThe only exception here would be a country who's very existance was threatened.  And really threatened, not nuge-nuge wink-wink threatened.\n\nSo should Israel launch a strike against Iran and Iran lobbed 500 missiles around Israel, that wouldn't be an threat to it's existance and the use of a Nuclar weapon in this case would not be tolerated.\n\nBut think of it this way.  If the world allowed a Nuclear response to a non nuclear country then every single country would make it their number one priority to get nuclear weapons to protect themselves from Nuclear attack.  Not going to happen and no Israel isn't a special case.\n\nIsrael's Nuclear weapons are as good as useless unless a country very existance is being threatened and even then it's likely that the rest of the world would come to their aid rather than see a nuke let off.",

            "comment": "Is he the highest ranking official to be diagnosed so far?\n\nEdit: a lot of comments reminded me that Prince Charles was diagnosed, had forgotten about him. Although people seem to be torn on who's a higher rank, apparently Charles is head of state and Boris is head of government. TIL. There's also Prince Albert of Monaco, another head of state and rumours swirl that Bolsonaro is positive too but hiding it. \n\nTLDR: Boris Johnson is one of the highest ranking officials to be positive for COVID19.\n\nEdit 2: OK now people are commenting that Charles isn't head of state l, the Queen is. That's what I thought too when I first put this up and first people commented that Charles is of higher rank than Boris. So is it Queen &gt; Charles &gt; Boris? \n\nTLDR: I'm not British so I'm confused on how the government works over there. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

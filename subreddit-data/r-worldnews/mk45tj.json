Ignored the comments and focused on policy. She got *destroyed* by this very adult and reasonable choice.\n\nMy guess is yhat's why AOC punches back so aggressively. Every time they say something wrong about her she smears it back in their faces and directly calls out the liars.\n\nI don't know if it will work in the long run, but it's at least an entertaining experiment.",

Lots of rumors about it being women on the bridge, and photos of the capsized frigate next to an older article with an interview with female crew and captain was circulated a lot on social media. \n\nOn a side-note when a car caught fire in a car park with 1600 vehicles at Sola airport, in Norway, last year rumors were quick to claim it was a Tesla that had caused the fire. \n\nNewspapers rushed to find various firemen talking about how difficult it was to put out an EV fire and yada yada yada. \n\nThen it turned out that the car that started the fire was an old Diesel engined Opel Zafira. \n\nThis didn\u2019t get nearly as much attention as the EV/Tesla news at the start of the incident. \n\nA while after the fire they also stated that of the several hundred EVs damaged in the fire not one had seen a fire in the battery pack. The diesel and petrol cars that burned, on the other hand, saw their fuel tanks go up in smoke. Lots of explosions, burned at high temperatures, and the parking garage even collapsed partially. \n\nThis did not get any news traction at all. Only mention I saw was a paywalled article in a technical magazine. \n\nFalse news definitely travel fast.",

And India and China are largely buying crude oil so Russia doesn't get the profit from refining.  \n\nBut the biggest thing is that Europe has pressed the accelerator on EVs.  Close to 1 in 4 new vehicles sold in Europe is now a plug-in.  That is a permanent drop in the demand for oil that has been accelerated by Putin.  Cheap domestic onshore wind, solar PV, hydropower, and offshore wind will power them.  Supplemented by nuclear, biomass, and geothermal.",

Outside of needing to train on new gear, the biggest aspect is the incompatibility of the systems - if your military logistics are already built around using Russian gear, that means all the bullets, explosive ordinances, etc needed to make your guns go boom are different specifications from NATO gear. That means you will need to functionally replace your whole existing ammo and explosives supplies to compliment the new weapons and replace the old gear. It\u2019s also very hard to retrofit existing weapons systems to be compatible with old platforms - if you have a Russian gun for a Russian plane, it isn\u2019t terribly difficult to plug it into the plane, whereas there is much more difficulty doing the same with a NATO gun on a Russian plane or vice versa.",

And whatever side you might be on in the war, there is probably a not insignificant risk that Russia might not be able to offer spare parts or support for your new submarines in the required quality and quantity in the coming decade or two. Or even fulfill the order. Submarines arent exactly same day delivery. Germany is just far more stable and a safer bet that you get what you ordered. \n\nAs a sidenote.

So while the narrative you guys might be shown locally is that the West is being a hypocrite, but in actuality, India buying and continuing to buy cheap oil, and the West then being the market for it are actually interlinked. \n\nPS: I have no issues with India buying the oil, just explaining the logic :)",

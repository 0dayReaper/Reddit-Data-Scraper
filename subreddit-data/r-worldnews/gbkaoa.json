They use the term domestic because that $2 cheapo corn based stuff just happens to also be made in the U.S.  They don't want to drop the term domestic because they don't want to imply you are buying low quality beer (which is what is actually what is going on).",

It's certainly not 1,500 guns, it's a lot closer to 300-400 guns, because of how many are redundant variants of nearly the exact same rifle, like the Eagle Arms Division AR15 is listed on there 10 times. \n\nProbably a good 900 on this list are just named specific AR15s.

            "comment": "Canadian here. To the best of my knowledge (correct me if I'm wrong, please): Automatic weapons are already banned. Any firearm requires licensing. Mace is illegal. Any weapon held with intent for self-defense is illegal (you can not carry a knife for defense). We have another tier of licensing for anything beyond a hunting rifle (more or less). Having that license subjects you to daily automated background checks. All weapons must be locked away, ammo must be separately locked away. There is never a justifiable reason to have your weapon loaded outside of hunting or shooting range. To move a restricted weapon (eg. Hand gun) out of your house, you must contact authorities, follow a designated route to the shooting range (and nowhere else, even stopping for gas) with the weapon locked up in a separate lockbox from your ammo at all times.\n\n\nI own no guns, and have only been shooting once. I am a very liberal, city dwelling Canadian with no pony in this race, who lived in multiple areas with rampant gun crime. I do not understand what this ban seeks to accomplish. We already have extremely locked down gun licensing, **daily** background checks, transportation restrictions, and extremely anti-personal-safety laws. You can not legally defend your home in Canada. You can not legally own any weapon, including bats or knives, with intent to use them for self-defense in any situation (to the best of my knowledge).\n\nI genuinely want somebody to explain to me how this ban could possibly reduce gun violence here. I am open to changing my view, but know that I've lived in some shady places with lots of gun crime and none of it was with legally purchased guns, because to own anything other than a hunting rifle or shotgun, you subject yourself to random police screenings and daily background checks.\n\nPeople who know the gun laws, and agree that this will help reduce violent crime Please explain why and I'm happy to learn.\n\nEdit: Corrections from responses!\n\n* Ammo and firearms can be stored together, but never loaded outside range/hunt\n* Authorization to transport restricted firearms is more lenient now, allowing predesignated routes, gas stations, and even hotel stays\n* Possibly able to carry a weapon (non-firearm), but this is still a bit murky for me",

First, I think there could be a decline, even if it\u2019s small, in self-inflicted gun injuries in the future.\n  \nOther than that, I really don\u2019t see how this targets the problem. The problem isn\u2019t which guns are causing crimes, it\u2019s where the guns came from, how they were obtained, and how they were used. I don\u2019t know anyone in the gun community who would have the audacity to act in such gross misconduct with a firearm because - and this is a hasty generalization, gun owners respect firearms and what they\u2019re capable of. Responsible and legal gun owners are extremely careful because they don\u2019t want to hurt themselves, their friends, their families or other members of the public. So where does this leave us? That seems to be the biggest question floating around",

However, culturally and in the more conservative political sphere, there are many who truly believe that access to guns is a protected right, like in the USA.\n\nAmerica is actually unique in that there is no constitutional restriction to gun rights.\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/2nd-amendment-countries-constitutional-right-bear-arms-2017-10",

I\u2019ll lead with I\u2019m an American so I get that this doesn\u2019t effect me at all, I just don\u2019t see many pro-gun folks giving any logical arguments. \n\nFirst of all. Automatic weapons are already illegal. The type of gun where you squeeze and hold the trigger and bullets continue to come out. Those are illegal. \n\nSemi-automatic means 1 squeeze = 1 bullet. \u201cAssault rifle\u201d in these instances purely refers to the cosmetic look of the gun. Technically a real assault rifle is a gun that can switch between automatic or semi automatic fire, or fire in bursts. No legal civilian rifles can do this anyways, so assault rifles as they pertain to civilians is a misnomer anyways. \n\nIf you take a Browning BAR Mark II and an AR-15. A BAR looks like your typical hunting rifle. An AR-15 is more of what the military would use. **IN TERMS OF LEGAL USE BY CIVILIANS** they are functionally **identical**. One squeeze, one bullet, magazine fed, pistol style grip. They are literally functionally identical. But they do not really look the same. \n\nThe argument that the pro-gun community is making is that a banning assault rifles is banning a gun for the look, not the function. It\u2019s more about a blue ribbon for \u201cwe banned assault rifles, hooray\u201d than about banning what they see as a problem. \n\nI understand this won\u2019t get a lot of love on Reddit, I\u2019m not after the internet points. I just hope that people can at least understand the logic of the pro-gun crowd even if they personally disagree on the fundamental issue of gun ownership.\n\nEdit* Changed Carbine to Remington R-25 then changed to a Browning BAR Mark II after it was brought to my attention the R-25 is also  on the list.",

The restricted class firearm had been acquired legally, and a coroner's inquest into the shooting recommended that all semi-automatic rifles be banned in Canada. The Common Sense Firearms Licensing Act passed in 2015 did not include a provision for such a ban. Sales of the CX4 Storm increased in Canada following the shooting, and in 2011, Beretta introduced a non-restricted (19\" barrel) variant of the Cx4, making it more accessible.",

Semi automatic rifles that feed from box magazines and fire intermediate caliber cartridges, for example, are found in all three categories: non-restricted, restricted and prohibited. It's completely arbitrary. Some ignorant politician sees some scary gun being used and they add it to a list. That's how it works. And people in the US see this shit as something to emulate... This is just that retardation in practice. More scary guns added to the list.\n\nUnder the arbitrary stupidity there are some decent laws that are workable, or at least there is a scaffolding there. Three tiers with escalating levels of restrictions. If you wanted to come up with some sensible laws that made more \"dangerous\" weapons harder to get you could do it but no. Ignorant politicians who don't know a bolt from a hammer, blowback from short stroke, a magazine from a clip just come up with lists of guns that they heard about on the news one time. It's embarrassing that these people are viewed as leaders of a supposed democracy.",

The overwhelming majority of people who own guns legally  are just everyday folks who enjoy a day out in the woods or at a range having fun with their friends and family, testing there skill and enjoying the day. What they are NOT, are creepy weirdos sitting in a dark room plotting to commit crime. The only time people hear about these guns is when some fruitloop with mental health issues or gangster commits some unspeakable crime. Everyday thousands of gun owners go out and enjoy themselves without so much as a bother to anyone else. MILLIONS of firearms owners here in Canada go about their days without most people never even knowing they own guns. Legal gun owners, regardless of what type of guns they own, are not a problem here in Canada. Why waste time with irrelevant laws that mean nothing to criminals?",

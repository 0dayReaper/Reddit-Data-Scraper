(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; The House of Commons has unanimously declared that Uyghurs and other minorities in the Xinjiang region are victims of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity, the first time a motion declaring genocide has been passed unopposed in the British parliament.\n\n&gt; The motion calls on the UK government to fulfil its obligations under the Genocide Convention and to use &amp;quot;All relevant instruments of international law&amp;quot; to bring the abuses against Uyghurs to an end.\n\n&gt; Next week the Italian Parliament&amp;#039;s Foreign Affairs Committee will debate a resolution proposed by IPAC member Delmastro delle Vedove condemning the genocide against Uyghurs, while a motion led by IPAC member Samuel Cogolati labelling the Chinese government&amp;#039;s actions in Xinjiang as a genocide has been tabled in the Belgian parliament.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/mw9czq/uk_parliament_unanimously_declares_the_chinese/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~572340 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Uyghur**^#1 **Genocide**^#2 **Chinese**^#3 **government**^#4 **parliament**^#5",

US - postpone consideration of. \"I'd like the issue to be tabled for the next few months\"\n2. BRITISH - present formally for discussion or consideration at a meeting. \"an MP tabled an amendment to the bill\"\n\nEdit: pleasantly surprised how many of you are discussing the two different uses of the word.  I will say, as an American who works with British people all day, I truly see the word work both ways.   Further proof that contextual clues obviously important in a multi-cultural environment!\n\nTo those of you confused by the US use of the word, I think about it this way... Imagine you're in a meeting.  You have handouts for each attendee, each sheet of paper outlines an issue to be discussed. You're going through an issue, can't come to consensus, and you ask the group to \"table it\".  Everyone puts down the sheet of paper and you move onto the next topic.",

Thus \"tabling\" originated as a term meaning \"to begin debate on an issue\".\n\nIn US Congress, there is no central table. Legislators have to contend with a small lectern. Consequently, when debating legislation, most resort to waving it about in the air for dramatic effect. Thus, in US politics, \"tabling\" means to put something back down on the table, suspending debate until some future time.",

That's actually been one of the main reasons so few genocides are officially recognized - because [under the rules of the Genocide Convention](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide-convention.shtml), if a nation officially recognizes a genocide they are obligated to do something to put a stop to it. Humans being humans, the unfortunate result is that, like a boss that only schedules employees for 19 hours a week so as not to have to have to pay anyone benefits, everybody just skirts the rules by never officially recognizing genocide.\n\nIf they commit to this, i wonder how this is all going to shake out.",

For example: Is there proper transportation infrastructure to ship materials in, and products out in the quantity required? What kind of environmental regulations are there local to the areas being considered, and what is enforcement for those things like? Is the local government stable? Will there be corrupt officials coming in looking for bribes all the time? Could the host government move to nationalize or otherwise push to take your facility /employees /product? Is the local population of the proper education level? What kinds of taxes will be required /tax breaks are available? What is the proximity of important resources? Are there similar businesses in the area that will compete or possibly benefit us, because the area will attract more experts? \n\nLabor is a big cost, and an incentive to move, but it isn't the only one. I agree that making the world a better place and benefitting developing communities helps reduce their exploitation, but it's way more complicated than it appears on the surface.",

We have a head of state until they either die or abdicate there's no political campaigning, populism, or any of that involved in succession.\n\nIt also means that we have a head of state that is likely *very* experienced in politics. Maybe not quite the philosopher Kings, but nonetheless someone who has been prepared for the position for the majority of their life.

Fossil fuels are only a tiny part of the equation. Biden\u2019s plan is almost idential to Trump\u2019s which was almost identical to Obama\u2019s, and they all have the same issue: it is impossible to process REMs without destroying the local environment. (Unsure about U.K. obv but I\u2019m certain we are all in a similar position.) This is why China is the world\u2019s primary producer of them; they were more than willing to waive environmentalists to produce REMs, and now they have a global monopoly due to dumping. \n\nLike seriously. We cannot create green tech without REMs, of which 80% of the market come from China, and we cannot decrease our reliance on fossil fuels without green tech. We are captured in a cycle that is incredibly difficult to break out of because of this. \n\nWe can only fix this in two ways: either we also waive environmental regulations to produce REMs (something I, as an environmentalist, am not wholly against if done responsibly, as we need them to manufacture green technology), or we invest in space mining. We have all the technology we need to mine in space, we just refuse to invest in it because the cost is literally astronomical. \n\nPersonally I think we need to get on space mining ASAP. China having a monopoly on REMs is a national security issue and there will be no such thing as economic independenc AND environmentalism unless we can get our minerals off-planet. We can get started on it RIGHT NOW. The only issue is up-front cost, but being able to freely have access to REMs would lead to another global economic revolution without a doubt.\n\nEdit: autocorrect corrections\n\nEdit2: here are articles if anyone wants to read a bit on the topic\n\nhttps://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/11/12/the-collapse-of-american-rare-earth-mining-and-lessons-learned/\n\nhttps://www.intheblack.com/articles/2019/08/01/extracting-truth-about-rare-earths\nThis article was posted 7 years ago, and not much has changed!\n\nhttps://www.livescience.com/37356-heavy-rare-earth-mining-america.html\n\nHere\u2019s a good primer on space mining for anyone interested:\n\nhttps://www.mining.com/the-global-race-to-mine-outer-space/\n\nhttps://science.howstuffworks.com/asteroid-mining.htm",

However the ability to boycott a specific country (especially China) based on products has become virtually impossible due to the complexity of the products and complexity of corporate structures (and international business agreements).  This is why pressuring our governments to take action may be the best next steps, and we will hopefully be willing to pay for it with higher prices, fewer purchase options, and apps that don\u2019t send our credit card information to totalitarian communist regimes (guess that last one wouldn\u2019t be so bad).",

As far as i've read, this obligatory solidarity (which IS a win) will be given if the country of arrival (let's say Italy) has a migration crisis.\n\nThere are three way of solidarity tho:\nA) taking a quota of immigrants \nB) paying 20.000\nC) sending personnel to help out.\n\nSo basically everyone can get out of the solidarity sending a bunch of dreamy 20yo that will serve hot soups to the immigrants, or did i read that wrong?",

Instead of charging 20.000\u20ac between each other it would be better to save money to build a humongous refugee camp, with several floors and space for millions of people.\n\nThey can be locked in there and get the shelter in Europe they want until they decide they would rather go back.

Out of the entire UK only 1 bank allowed me to open an account, besides Monese, which is not actually a bank. While for most people it's a matter of completing an online form and then getting the card in the mail, for me it was 3 life-story-interviews with 2 tellers before they finally allowed it. I had to use my friend's account for the first two months of my employment, he'd just cash it out and give me. After that I was finally accepted by Monese. ~5 months later the bank finally called back and invited me for the interviews. They said their systems were giving them errors whenever they tried to search my name so they needed manual entry to open my account (I didn't exist yet in their databases).\n\nRenting: lol no. the only way you could start there if you already knew someone who's already there, so they;d let you stay at their place until you could figure out a way to make some kind of \"proof of address\" or fake some kind of references for your future letting agency. Private landlords are excrutiatingly rare!\n\nOut of that entire ~200.000 town, only once employment agency was known to give \"proof of address\". It was just a letter that said \"employer x testifies that person y is listed with address z\", which only that one bank in the city accepted. No other entity accepted it anywhere else, zero value.\n\nOut of ~30 letting agencies in that town, less than half allowed me to enter their office and enquire about their offerings, only 2 offered a house (1 was a Russian lady, the other was a very black guy). Everybody else promised they'd call back, but never did ;)\n\nMy work colleague was renting a room in some 6 bedroom house... ~10-15 people total, second week in, two people got stabbed over some political argument. He noped out of there, he found some garage an old couple was renting out, lived there for ~a month, found a room after that, next day he came from work his room was filled with clearly stolen car tires.. He dumped them outside, months later still no idea who put them there.. until the garbage men finally decided to take them from the yard.\n\nMy neighbor from Moldova when to Netherlands or Belgium for work, I forget. The area where the company gave him the room, was so filthy, the local city apparently didn't come to collect trash for over 6 months. It was known that immigrants live there, so local authorities apparently didn't bother anymore after a few incidents. He stayed a night, got his back, and came back straight home after overhearing some beatings. Down a few hundred euroes, but at least he's alive.\n\nBelieve me, I've seen so many bad people out there, I'm not sure there's any good people left. I try hard, but I just don't see it.\n\nHonestly, and non-confrontational, you probably have a very distorted view of humanity since you've been so lucky I guess.\n\nSorry for lashing out, I guess.",

Either the new country grants them citizenship, or the danger in the old country stops.\n\nThere's nothing about crossing borders just once.\n\n\nIf every refugee had to stop after crossing just one border we'd get strange situations.\n\nFirst of all, Jews fleeing Nazi Germany would have never been able to get to the US, Australia, or Palestine. They'd have to just go one country over and stop.\n\nThey are one of the reasons the 1951 Refugee Convention was written.\n\nAnd today, Iran would have to take care of all Afghani refugees, Lebanon and Turkey of all Syrians, and Poland of all Ukranians.\n\nAt the same time the wealthiest countries in the world, where refugees actually would have the best chance of finding work and a decent life, would take none, because wealthy countries usually don't border conflict countries.",

But the dam breaking destroyed many Russian entrenchments along the bank of the river which you can see on satellite images.

It's more likely they this last issue is what caused undermining of the dam, which combined with overtopping, collapsed it.\n\nWhat is failed blackmail in this scenario?",

What we know for sure is that the damage done was only physically possible by explosives placed inside and at the base of the dam - missile strikes are not nearly powerful enough and shelling would have taken hours and perhaps days of continuous fire to breach the structure. That means the culprit had time, equipment, engineering, and access. That means the only possible culprit is Russia. The only \u201cwhy\u201d is that they thought it would benefit them more than it hurt them, or that it would hurt Ukraine more than it would benefit Ukraine. Whether Russia is right or not in those beliefs is secondary - there is no reasonable doubt that Russia blew the dam. \n\nRussia has a long history of scorched earth tactics.

Ukraine is going to cut the land bridge to Crimea. Once they do they'll have access to the Sea of Azov where they'd be able to target ferries. And they can take out the Kerch bridge anytime they want. When water and food starts getting sparse, who do you think the Kremlin is going to prioritize? Soldiers or Civilians..",

Not only that, but the water that is left will be very cyclic and variable because they have dry seasons and rainy seasons, and there's no way to capture and store the rainy season water for use during the dry season. And even more worse than that, every time it does rain on the watershed where the lake used to be all sorts of pollution and soviet-era contaminated sediments are going to get washed into the remaining river. It would not surprise me if that river can't sustain life for many, many years, maybe even decades.\n\nEdit: The other big issue is that sewage treatment plants also need water for the various processes they use to get black water suitable for putting back in the river, and all the treatment plants are located far away from a source of that process water now, so getting water to the homes is only half the problem. There probably won't be enough for any large industry either, so really all of the major cities that depended on this reservoir will end up being little more than survival camps for internal refugees.",

They refuse to show up to the area of the dam explosion, refuse to acknowledge Russia blew it up, and just overall elsewhere in the country they aren't showing their best. They seem to be much less capable than we have seen in the past - which means either the organization is falling a good bit in quality or they don't want to help Ukraine as much as they could be.",

The fuel rods do generate a lot of heat just sitting there, hence the need to keep them cool. Not nearly as much water is needed for that compared to when a reactor is at full power. There's a pond on the site that has water enough for a little while of cooling, maybe months, and they'll have to build a pipeline out to the new river location and install pumps, but that can be done if only they can clean the area of Russians. For sure the Russians aren't going to do anything to stop that water from running out, as they've so clearly shown they don't give two shits about the rest of the world.",

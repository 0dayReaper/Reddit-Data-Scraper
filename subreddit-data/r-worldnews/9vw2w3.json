I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot; but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose. But fortunately I had my manuscript, so you see I was going to make a long speech, and there is a bullet - there is where the bullet went through - and it probably saved me from it going into my heart. The bullet is in me now, so that I cannot make a very long speech, but I will try my best.\"*  \n  \n~ Theodore Roosevelt, on making a routine campaign speech.\n\n&gt; *Nah, it's raining.*  \n  \n~ Trump, on honoring fallen soldiers on a historic anniversary.  \n  \nHow far we've come.",

                    "comment": "This is how Trump reacts in a crisis:\n\n\nThe Time Donald Trump Turned Away in Disgust While a Man Was Bleeding to Death in Front of Him\n\nHoward Stern is the greatest celebrity interviewer alive, bar none. He is possessed of an uncanny ability to induce self-revelation, stroking and feeding the ego until it swells up and bursts. And nobody\u2019s ego is bigger than Donald Trump\u2019s, the bloviating New York real-estate baron turned bumbling politician. The two lascivious man-children were a match made in shock-jock heaven (or is it hell?), with each successive boast offering peeks into the Donald\u2019s damaged psyche.\n\nThe Stern-Trump interviews, spread out over 35 on-air appearances between 1993 and 2015\u2014and totaling around 15 hours\u2014came back to bite candidate Trump a bit during the campaign. First revisited by yours truly at The Daily Beast\u2014and later to far more consequential effect by ace reporters Andrew Kaczynski and Nathan McDermott, of BuzzFeed and CNN\u2014the Stern interviews saw Trump at his crudest and most unguarded, whether it was objectifying his daughter Ivanka or, in a moment that haunted him during the presidential debates, confessing that he initially supported the invasion of Iraq.\n\n\u201cThis is who Trump is,\u201d said Stern of the 45th president. \u201cHe was always bombastic. He always rated women. He always talked in a misogynistic, sexist kind of way, but he did it sort of proudly and out in the open.\u201d\n\nThis week, Bill Frischling over at Factbl.og dove in to the Howard Stern Show archives and uploaded all of the Stern-Trump interviews online. While the most shocking bits had already been mined by reporters in the lead-up to his surprise election victory, some new Trump information came to light, from his bizarre idea on how to combat airline terrorists (\u201cthe pilot\u2026 presses a button and sleeping gas comes out\u201d) to telling Stern he hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton prior to the 2008 Democratic primary to opening up about his and Melania\u2019s sex life.\n\nOn an April 16, 2004, interview with Stern, Trump shares that he turned down several reality-show offers because \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have anybody watch me comb my hair,\u201d while in an interview conducted on Feb. 27, 2006, Donald, Ivanka, and Don. Jr. can\u2019t figure out the answer to what 17 x 6 is. \u201c96? 94?\u201d offers Don Jr. \u201cThat\u2019s not a practical application, though,\u201d adds Ivanka, refusing the question. \u201cIt\u2019s 112,\u201d chimes in Donald, who repeatedly insists that the answer is 112. If that weren\u2019t enough, on no less than 10 occasions Trump shares the exact same story from his star-studded wedding to Marla Maples, with Stern telling reporters \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house\u201d and \u201cI give it six months\u201d\u2014comments that Trump cheerfully claims left Maples in tears on their wedding night.\n\nThe most eye-opening story from the unearthed Stern-Trump interviews, however, came during a chat on July 16, 2008.\n\nTrump, a notorious germaphobe, is discussing his extreme distaste for blood. The mere sight of it, he says, causes him to recoil in disgust. Perhaps it explains why he accused then Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly of having her period after she asked him a tough question during a presidential debate, or why he sought multiple deferments to dodge the Vietnam War.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not good for medical. In other words, if you cut your finger and there\u2019s blood pouring out, I\u2019m gone,\u201d he told Stern.\n\nThe former reality-TV host then shares a story with Stern about the time he thought a man died in front of him during a charity event at his Palm Beach club Mar-a-Lago and, rather than helping the injured man, Trump turned away in disgust at the sight of his blood.\n\n\u201cI was at Mar-a-Lago and we had this incredible ball, the Red Cross Ball, in Palm Beach, Florida. And we had the Marines. And the Marines were there, and it was terrible because all these rich people, they\u2019re there to support the Marines, but they\u2019re really there to get their picture in the Palm Beach Post\u2026 so you have all these really rich people, and a man, about 80 years old\u2014very wealthy man, a lot of people didn\u2019t like him\u2014he fell off the stage,\u201d said Trump.\n\nTrump proceeds to explain that it was a $100,000-per-table fundraiser filled with deep-pocketed billionaires, and that the Marines were\u2014for whatever reason\u2014given tables in the very back of the ballroom (\u201cthe worst table in the whole place\u201d). Oh, and that he was more preoccupied with his ballroom\u2019s pristine marble floor than the octogenarian bleeding out on it.\n\n\u201cSo what happens is, this guy falls off right on his face, hits his head, and I thought he died. And you know what I did? I said, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019 and I turned away,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI couldn\u2019t, you know, he was right in front of me and I turned away. I didn\u2019t want to touch him\u2026 he\u2019s bleeding all over the place, I felt terrible. You know, beautiful marble floor, didn\u2019t look like it. It changed color. Became very red. And you have this poor guy, 80 years old, laying on the floor unconscious, and all the rich people are turning away. \u2018Oh my God! This is terrible! This is disgusting!\u2019 and you know, they\u2019re turning away. Nobody wants to help the guy. His wife is screaming\u2014she\u2019s sitting right next to him, and she\u2019s screaming.\u201d\n\nThank God for the Marines. \u201cWhat happens is, these 10 Marines from the back of the room\u2026 they come running forward, they grab him, they put the blood all over the place\u2014it\u2019s all over their uniforms\u2014they\u2019re taking it, they\u2019re swiping [it], they ran him out, they created a stretcher. They call it a human stretcher, where they put their arms out with, like, five guys on each side,\u201d shared Trump.\n\n\u201cI was saying, \u2018Get that blood cleaned up! It\u2019s disgusting!\u2019 The next day, I forgot to call [the man] to say he\u2019s OK,\u201d said Trump, adding of the blood, \u201cIt\u2019s just not my thing.\u201d",

Firstly, he's not *just* Churchill's grandson, Sir Nicolas Soames has been a Conservative MP since the last 80's, and was the UK's Minister for the Armed Forces in the early 90's in the John Major government. \n\nFor the sake of balance, I should also say he's a massive twat with terrible political views in my opinion, but the guy is a knighted democratically-elected politician who served in the British Army and has been outspoken in defence of its interests for decades. The idea that the 'liberal media' have trotted out a random, unknown celebrity grandson and circulated his tweets for a cheap shot is an attempt at some sort of delusional defence of your President's moral cowardice.",

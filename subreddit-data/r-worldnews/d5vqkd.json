Now, how much of that is dependent on the goods/raw materials coming from other states, that would likely have a loss of GDP going both ways. Another few percent on each side. So the would likely drop to 12-13% of current USGDP, and USGDP would actually fall 17-18% likely even more with strong reaction in the stock market. Listings may even change based on those companies no longer being based in the US.\n\nI mean we would be looking at a Brexit, but worse. How much of the California economy relies on traveling, that just became more of a hassle. They may still be able to continue use of US currency, but that would be in a decline, so likely wouldn\u2019t have too much of an impact to switch, which would devalue US currency even that little bit more.\n\nNot even into military at this point. How much would the loss be due to loss of military contracts. Then having to spend the money on their own. Or get some strong allies.\n\nMan, nobody knew how complicated this could be...\n\nI know I am putting too much thought in this. But I started thinking of the over all logistics.",

California has officially seceded from the United States of America, but not without conflict. Prior to secession, California and the US were engaged in a trade war so brutal it was leading toward a global economic collapse. Fearing this would lead to Mutually Assured Destruction, CA and the US reluctantly agreed to meet for negotiation in a neutral country... enter Canada. The two sides met and battled in a Great War of Words, verbally sparring while Canada mediated from the sidelines. \n\nBut something unexpected happened over the course of the resolution summit. While California argued, Canada listened. It REALLY listened. It heard California's reasons for secession - CA wanted to fight climate change, ensure equal rights, support and welcome those in need, educate, give everyone opportunity, etc. - and Canada agreed. Sure, California had been clumsy at times in its attempts at progress and had a dark history of its own, but in the last few decades its intentions has become clear: it wanted to take care of its people and offer them real freedom. \n\nCanada thought a lot about what California stood for, its rights and policies not so different from its own. It looked at California and saw a great future... a great future *together*. With California's strategic location, booming economy (at least before the Trade War), expansive agriculture and farming, warm weather and generally sunny disposition, Canada could become a real global Superpower. The benefits were endless, but Canada had to act soon; the resolution summit was almost over. If it was serious about absorbing California, Canada would need to strike before it was too late.\n\nWhen the US President left a negotiation session early, rushing off to eat at a \"Tim Hortons\" while mentioning something about hygiene, Canada didn't waste a minute. It asked California to stay back to have a chat, and 4 hours later the two were *still* chatting, excitedly discussing all the benefits and risks that could come out of a merge. They agreed to meet again the next morning in secret, when the US President spent his daily \"executive time.\" Both were giddy that night, dreaming of all the opportunities to come.\n\nThe next morning, Canada and California met again, but the mood had shifted: California was acting nonchalant and mysterious, a complete 180 from the excitement it had shown the day before. Canada was about to ask what was wrong when California produced several packets of information, complete with graphs and data analyzing both Canada and California, and passed them around the room. They were laminated and color coded. Canada suddenly felt embarrassed it had only brought donuts. \n\nThe information packets were well researched and compelling. Looking at the evidence right in front of them, Canada couldn't deny California's superior population size, high GDP, and most damning of all: Canada's history of citizens emigrating to California, from Seth Rogen to Justin Bieber. \n\nAfter exhausted discussion, Canada finally relented. It would actually be California that absorbed Canada as its own. The new, merged country would be called \"Cannafornia\" - a combination of both names with an added ode to cannabis, legal in both regions. Cannafornia would go by all of Old California's rules, and the people of Old Canada would need to learn new ways and assimilate. Canada knew this was a risk, and could result in backlash from its people, but it felt it was a risk worth taking. California pushed a contract forward, and Canada signed. The deal was done.\n\nWhen the US President entered the room for negotiations, walking in with dried drool on his chin and the fresh imprint of a television remote on his cheek, he was surprised to see Canada and California were already in the room, beaming with smiles. They asked him to sit down, and they slowly explained what was happening. Canada would join California's ranks and the US would need to back down entirely without compromise. \n\nThe US President was flabbergasted, his chair creaking as he leaned forward and buried his face into his hands. He immediately asked if it was a joke and said it wasn't funny. They told him it was really happening. He looked up, red in the face, insulting each of them. They sat calmly and waited until he tired himself out. He begged for them not to do it, and he threatened to wage war against them both. They reminded him of the many military bases stationed in California, and how Canada borders all of the Northern US. The US President looked down again, his face contorting as if he was about to cry. It was almost sad. Then a flip switched in the US President. He congratulated them, shook hands, and left the room. About 17 minutes later, Canada and California each received a \"ping\" alerting them of a tweet by the US President:\n\n*It's a shame that Canada and California aren't good enough for the US, we wish we could take them in. But no handouts!! America comes first! We will build a NEW wall, a Great Wall that stretches from Mexico to California to Canada. Bye bye, losers! Keep America Great!!!*\n\nCanada laughed nervously reading the tweet and California sighed from relief. The US President was too incompetent to retaliate. The exhausting deal negotiations were over, and a new era could begin. They looked up from their phones, contemplating, and locked eyes across the room.\n\n\"Are we really doing this?\" California asked tentatively.\n\n\"We really are.\" Canada answered, smiling confidently. California smiled back. The two stood up, joined each other by the door, and grabbed each others' hands. They held onto them as they walked out the door, appearing before the clicks and flashes of global paparazzi. It was really happening. They stood behind a podium full of mics and raised their hands up to the sky, signaling the dreams and opportunities to come from their union.

I feel like I'm screaming into the void. \n\nAs a kid, I grew up tumbling around in the dirt and grass.  \n\nI always helped my grandma re-fill the hummingbird feeder in her garden. We got quite a few ruby-throated ones every year, plus a couple little ones I can't remember the names of anymore. They kept us busy. I watched the phoebe birds return year after year to the same nest in the eave of the back door to hatch chicks. I looked for robins in the spring, woodpeckers in the summer and fall, and cardinals in the winter. Red-tail Hawks were common too. \n\nI gardened, picking slugs and snails off of plants and pruning petunias by age six. I knew my annuals and perennials by ten. I learned silver greenery/felted plants kept deer from munching flowers, and I learned the names of the local wild flowers. Forget the super bloom all over Instagram, the Taconic Parkway in the summer is where it's at. I also learned what to avoid-poison ivy, poison sumac. I was taught what as edible, like dandelion, and the wild onions.\n\nIn her backyard, there's an apple tree, nearly 60 years old and miraculously still producing apples. Every fall we'd nearly pee ourselves with laughter watching my grandma run out the back door to chase the deer away with a broom, trying to save the apples for pie. I remember swinging in an old rope hammock between two enormous oak trees off of the porch. If you ever want to be moved, hike the Shawangunks in October- the whole area looks like it's on fire with the maple trees. \n\nI caught frogs in the creek by the side of the house, and crept along stream beds with my dad to catch easily-spooked trout. We brought earthworms we dug up in the early morning hours that seemed as long as my little forearm. Salamanders would slither away if we stepped too close. \n\nI would scream in terror from big hairy wolf spiders and daddy long-legs, and I'd count the spots of lady bugs. Little crab spiders would crawl into and out of flowers; they came in every color in the crayola box you could think of. My parents and I planted butterfly bushes. I'd spot chrysalises and come back every day to see if a butterfly had hatched. Us little kids collected cicada shells to stick to the adults as pranks.\n\nThere were acres of woods out back that my cousins and I would explore. We built tree forts, collected deer skulls and bones, and sit on low walls of stacked slate stones, hundreds of years old. \n\nI learned to swim in the local feeder river, keeping my feet clear of the turtles and watching the beavers build their dams. Dragon flies were out in droves for mating season during swimming months. It was a blessing because they ate all the mosquitoes. All the little kids cut their teeth fishing sunnies off the dock. When I got bigger, my dad took me to the main river and taught me to fly fish for steelhead. \n\nAs I got older, I watched the town sell out rights to the river. It got dammed up and dumped in and it's no more than ankle deep now. The beavers, sunnies, snakes, and turtles are long gone. There's a public notice to warn people of harmful bacteria, no wading allowed. The creek in the yard dried up, and the little stream ways are empty of fish. When you hear about bears, it's because they're getting pushed out of their territory. They're desperately rooting through people's trash. We've started seeing more and more of them dead on the road, hit by cars while rummaging. The humming birds are much fewer and farther between. The summers are getting so hot that it's causing diseases that were never seen in those parts on all the crops from the local farmers. When I was a kid, summers rarely got above the mid 80s at the worst. It regularly hit the mid 90s this year. More and more often, the trees don't turn til mid October instead of September. When they do, the leaves just go a dull yellow, then brown from the warm, wet falls. The winters aren't getting cold enough either- tick populations have sky-rocketed, and it's not safe to go exploring anymore. \n\nI'm married now, but only in my twenties; the changes happened that quickly. My childhood was absolutely magical. My life is so tied to the land I grew up on-I even made my wedding bouquet all plants I knew grew around there: ferns, lamb's ear, Queen Anne's lace, wild berries, clover, thistle, chicory, mums.\n\nI used to get so sad thinking my kids would never get to have those experiences that had been essential to my family for generations. Now I don't think I'll be having kids at all. It doesn't look like the powers that be want to start fixing this any time soon; if anything it's getting worse. It doesn't feel right to bring an innocent child into a mess like this. \n\nI'm sorry for the novel; I'll probably put this in a letter to a representative soon. But I just want this to exist out there. I want strangers to see it so it can be preserved in a way, because I'm watching it get destroyed in front of me and I don't think I can save it physically. The best I can do is not let the memory/imagery die.\n\n**EDIT**: Thank you guys so much, for the gold, for the sympathy and kindness in the comments, for sharing your experiences. Honestly made me cry. I didn't think anybody would see this. I was just writing out of sadness and desperation but I'm so happy it resonated with literally anyone. \n\nI hope there's enough of us to at least halt the ship by the end of my lifetime, if not turn it around. Vote for people who care about what you care about, get involved in your local eco-groups, and share information with each other. Also learn how to determine bullshit from honest-to-god good sources. The people with interests in halting climate change activists rely on us being ignorant and poorly read. I know it's exhausting; I feel like I'm too tired from the daily grind to give a shit half the time, but don't give them these victory. We're all we've got. If we go, at least we went trying.",

That\u2019s why they want to roll back all these regulations even when the industries themselves say they want it. That\u2019s why they wants the wall so bad, they see a future where climate refugees are fleeing north and they wants to get a head start on the \u2018defense system\u2019. That\u2019s also why Trump wants to buy Greenland, he knows it will be warmer there soon. Trump and the GOP only feign denial of climate change to mask the true goal of ushering it in under the premiss that the U.S. is in a position to come out ahead in a 'climate disaster\u2019 future while much of the rest of the world suffers, securing the U.S. as the world ruler. Putin also has the same idea for Russia, so the alliance with the GOP works on that level too.\n\nBut after the El Paso shooters dumb-ass manifesto I\u2019m thinking it might be true, at least of the Alt-Right. Much of the Alt-Right openly accepts the science of climate change. But while some seem to be in favor of taking steps to curtail it, most seem to be of the mindset of \u2018we need to make sure WHITE people survive this\u2019 with no regard for anyone else on the planet. Hell, many of them talk about climate change as \u2018curbing African populations\u2019. So while some may not want to usher in climate change, their priority is only to \u2018harden a white America\u2019 against any repercussions from it and leave the rest of the \u2018undesirables\u2019 to perish in it.",

The US is the most carbon-intensive country in the world per capita, meaning that YES, the solution to climate change and climate mitigation has to come from effective US leadership, or at the very least cooperation with the plans of the rest of the world. That's definitely not going to happen under Trump, and these are the last good years we have where making a big change is even *possible*. We need to start yesterday, we don't have time to wait until 2024.",

                                    "comment": "Here ya go\n\n&gt;\tDuring the week of Easter, Britain enjoyed\u2014if that is the right word\u2014a break from the intricate torment of Brexit. The country\u2019s politicians disappeared on vacation and, in their absence, genuine public problems, the kinds of things that should be occupying their attention, rushed into view. In Northern Ireland, where political violence is worsening sharply, a twenty-nine-year-old journalist and L.G.B.T. campaigner named Lyra McKee was shot and killed while reporting on a riot in Londonderry. In London, thousands of climate-change protesters blocked Waterloo Bridge, over the River Thames, and Oxford Circus, in the West End, affixing themselves to the undersides of trucks and to a pink boat named for Berta C\u00e1ceres, an environmental activist and indigenous leader, who was murdered in Honduras. Slightly more than a thousand Extinction Rebellion activists, between the ages of nineteen and seventy-four, were arrested in eight days. On Easter Monday, a crowd performed a mass die-in at the Natural History Museum, under the skeleton of a blue whale. In a country whose politics have been entirely consumed by the maddening minutiae of leaving the European Union, it was cathartic to see citizens demanding action for a greater cause. In a video message, Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, compared the civil disobedience in London to the civil-rights movement of the sixties and the suffragettes of a century ago. \u201cIt is not the first time in history we have seen angry people take to the streets when the injustice has been great enough,\u201d she said.\n\n&gt;\tOn Tuesday, as members of Parliament returned to work, Greta Thunberg, the sixteen-year-old Swedish environmental activist, was in Westminster to address them. Last August, Thunberg stopped attending school in Stockholm and began a protest outside the Swedish Parliament to draw political attention to climate change. Since then, Thunberg\u2019s tactic of going on strike from school\u2014inspired by the response to the Parkland shooting in Florida last year\u2014has been taken up by children in a hundred countries around the world. In deference to her international celebrity, Thunberg was given a nauseatingly polite welcome in England. John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, briefly held up proceedings to mark her arrival in the viewing gallery. Some M.P.s applauded, breaching the custom of not clapping in the chamber. When Thunberg spoke to a meeting of some hundred and fifty journalists, activists, and political staffers, in Portcullis House, where M.P.s have their offices, she was flanked by Ed Miliband, the former Labour Party leader; Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary and a prominent Brexiteer; and Caroline Lucas, Britain\u2019s sole Green Party M.P., who had invited her.\n\n&gt;\tThunberg, who wore purple jeans, blue sneakers, and a pale plaid shirt, did not seem remotely fazed. Carefully unsmiling, she checked that her microphone was on. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d she asked. \u201cAround the year 2030, ten years, two hundred and fifty-two days, and ten hours away from now, we will be in a position where we set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control that will most likely lead to the end of our civilization as we know it.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tThunberg\u2014along with her younger sister\u2014has been given a diagnosis of autism and A.D.H.D. In interviews, she sometimes ascribes her unusual focus, and her absolute intolerance of adult bullshit on the subject of climate change, to her neurological condition. \u201cI see the world a bit different, from another perspective,\u201d she told my colleague Masha Gessen. In 2015, the year Thunberg turned twelve, she gave up flying. She travelled to London by train, which took two days. Her voice, which is young and Scandinavian, has a discordant, analytical clarity. Since 2006, when David Cameron, as a reforming Conservative Party-leadership contender, visited the Arctic Circle, Britain\u2019s political establishment has congratulated itself on its commitment to combatting climate change. Thunberg challenged this record, pointing out that, while the United Kingdom\u2019s carbon-dioxide emissions have fallen by thirty-seven per cent since 1990, this figure does not include the effects of aviation, shipping, or trade. \u201cIf these numbers are included, the reduction is around ten per cent since 1990\u2014or an average of 0.4 per cent a year,\u201d she said. She described Britain\u2019s eagerness to frack for shale gas, to expand its airports, and to search for dwindling oil and gas reserves in the North Sea as absurd. \u201cYou don\u2019t listen to the science because you are only interested in solutions that will enable you to carry on like before,\u201d she said. \u201cLike now. And those answers don\u2019t exist anymore. Because you did not act in time.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tThe climate-change movement feels powerful today because it is politicians\u2014not the people gluing themselves to trucks\u2014who seem deluded about reality. Thunberg says that all she wants is for adults to behave like adults, and to act on the terrifying information that is all around us. But the impact of her message does not come only from her regard for the facts. Thunberg is an uncanny, gifted orator. Last week, the day after the fire at Notre-Dame, she told the European Parliament that \u201ccathedral thinking\u201d would be necessary to confront climate change.\n\n&gt;\tYesterday, Thunberg repeated the phrase. \u201cAvoiding climate breakdown will require cathedral thinking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling.\u201d In Westminster, Thunberg\u2019s words were shaming. Brexit is pretty much the opposite of cathedral thinking. It is a process in which a formerly great country is tearing itself apart over the best way to belittle itself. No one knew what to say to Thunberg, or how to respond to her exhortations. Her microphone check was another rhetorical device. \u201cDid you hear what I just said?\u201d she asked, in the middle of her speech. The room bellowed, \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cIs my English O.K.?\u201d The audience laughed. Thunberg\u2019s face flickered, but she did not smile. \u201cBecause I\u2019m beginning to wonder.\u201d",

It's rational instead of filtered through emotion/social rules. It's really refreshing. (Proud Swede)",

It just means you have sensory issues and trouble understanding people a bit. Similar to how all people with dyslexia are different.",

While we waste food, drive far too much in shitty vehicles, consume products that are terrible, never degrade, and cause pollution, and then debate if the climate is changing. All while we blow energy at heating and cooling our houses to combat the change in climate.\n\nIn reality we really aren't doing anything, as a whole. We're 20 times worse at producing emission than India, which trumps us in population.\n\nThe thing we're not doing is calling our political parties, demanding they take charge and correct legislation, pass green bills, and more importantly change our own life styles to combat things. Recycling and using less electricity doesn't do shit in the big picture, unfortunately. It might save us a few years, it would seem, to allow other nations to figure out what will work and develop technology, but we as Americans are just a king their work harder.\n\nI think it's just because we're ignorant to the truth about our emission, consumption, and the process of climate change. We can blame ourselves, but we also need to be blaming corporations and political parties because they're a huge part of the problem.\n\nYou know who made the commercial where the Indian is crying because people were littering? A corporation; to direct the blame of pollution at us. These are corporations that have known for decades what the outcome would be - they ignored it and shifted the blame.\n\nSo you want to save the planet? Call your local and state representatives. Demand they work towards green legislation, and flat out tell them you will not be voting for them, in fact lobbying against them, in favor of someone who will.\n\nHell post the email or phone call on Facebook, and twitter, and IG if it will help.",

I know companies and a sad orange man are doing what they can to keep making money in oil, and to prevent more progress.\n\nI just wanted to say that there are people and cities trying to make a difference, and that it is progress. It's better than nothing.\n\nEdit 2: My point is, things are absolutely not where they should be, but there is some progress. Is it enough? No. Is it still progress? Yes.",

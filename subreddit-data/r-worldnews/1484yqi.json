[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He was a long-limbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism. He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down. His specialty was alfalfa, and he made a good thing out of not growing any. The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa he did not grow. The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major's father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county. Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money and was therefore wise. \u201cAs ye sow, so shall ye reap,\u201d he counseled one and all, and everyone said, \u201cAmen.\u201d \n\n\u2015 Joseph Heller, Catch-22",

Without the government acting as a safety net, the risk at the farm level is higher many years than prices would support. Either farmers grow less food, or prices for everyone rise, likely in line with the current subsidy programs. The only issue with this would be that it would function as a regressive tax.\n\nSmoothing out the revenue at the farm gate and subsidizing the inherent risk is a good thing, in my opinion, as an over abundance of food is better than a shortage. We need to keep people with access and clean water and food.\n\nCan we do better and encourage better food? Probably. But the underlying premise is a good one imo.",

And they continue to vote people in who barely believe in it either. \n\nCanada also produce so much CO2. We also thought climate change would never hit us very hard. Suddenly, since 2015 2 towns have burnt down, we\u2019ve seen 50 degree heatwaves where 600 people die, one of the worst hurricanes then immediately after, the worst wildfire Nova Scotia has seen. Unprecedented wildfires across the entire country at once. The North Atlantic is 1.1 degrees past the average. There are whales beaching all across the Atlantic coast of Canada. I could go on and on. \n\nthis is almost like KARMA for us. But not actually. Unfortunately us citizens are going to deal with all of this. The elite will feel nothing and will have already divided us",

You're making a blanket accusation accusing people of being antivaxxers or climate deniers based on the media spin off from our last election.\n\nThe Social Credit Party ran Alberta for decades until 70s when they got beat by the more moderate Progressive Conservatives. The SCP were absolutely corrupt, in bed with the oil industry, and hyper religious dingbats. They lost because the PC party were moderates. The SCP got back in by taking over the western separatist movement which is where the anti-Trudeau hate came from. They kicked out the people who started it, rebranded it as the Reform Party. The UCP is just the latest version of the SCP.\n\nThey still work for the oil industry, and have even more corporate buddies down south and they're absolutely selling us out in a myriad of ways, and we can't really do shit about it until we stop yelling at each other about it. Here in Alberta, you have urban city people talking shit about rural people which is where the UCP gets all their voters from. \n\nOur media owned by a small handful of giant corporations who side with the UCP and sabotage our elections. They push the idea that Trudeau works with Notley which isn't even remotely true but it's used to get rural voters support by bringing up Trudeau. His Dad wasn't liked back in the day and the UCP uses that to their advantage.",

You're making a blanket accusation accusing people of being antivaxxers or climate deniers based on the media spin off from our last election.\n\nI don't hate antivaxxers or climate deniers because of the media. I didn't need the media to develop my hatred for them. I also didn't need the media to \"accuse\" people of being climate deniers and antivaxxers because these people voted for a person exactly like that to represent them in both this election and the previous one.\n\nYou could be a climate-conscious tree- hugger but if you vote UCP, you are functionally the same as the climate denier because you voted for the same politician. It's exactly why the people we vote for are tasked with REPRESENTING us. Keyword being REPRESENTING if I hadn't made it obvious enough. We look at these politicians and we decide if they are an adequate reflection of our own values. And yet time and time again your \"victims\" of media narratives have voted for people who should never be representatives of anybody, let alone a leader for an entire province. They voted for a person in the previous election that literally spent like 15 million + upkeep on his little \"war room\" that was found to spew anti-climate change propaganda. And now in the most recent election voted for a person endorsed by antivaxxers. \n\nYou complain about avoiding lumping all Albertans as antivaxxers or climate deniers, I say what the fuck does it matter? I'm in Alberta but in what context would it matter that I'm not a climate change denier, that I'm not an antivaxxer? It doesn't fucking matter anymore what I believe because I'm represnted and led by people who don't give a fuck about climate change. The policies that will be passed in this province won't account for anything that I believe in.\n\nYou wanna talk about Divide &amp; Conquer? The media isn't the main driving force for that. I didn't vote for the UCP despite you describing the potency of media propaganda, and I'm just pretty unremarkable and average guy. \n\nI am continuously perplexed that as stupid as I am, I can still see that out of the NDP and the UCP, the former is the lesser of two evils, so why the fuck can so many people not see what my simple brain finds so obvious? How fucking brain dead can people seriously get?\n\nSpeaking to all these Albertan hicks, the only reason there is a \"Divide &amp; Conquer\" is because bitch, WE are waiting on YOU.  You're the one dividing us because you're fucking kneecapping us every time we take a step forward. Every time you are confronted about your stupidity you cower and hide behind the comforts of law and order yelling \"persecution\" while simultaneously undermining the lives of your fellow Albertans because of the people you vote for. Get your fucking shit together. I know change takes time but we don't have an infinite amount of it waiting on you to learn your fucking lesson.",

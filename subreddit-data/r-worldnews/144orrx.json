They tell you not to release creatures because the reservoir is designed for a certain population and natural balance. If humans put random aquatic animals in there it can fuck up the whole reservoir.\n\n\"Life\" in our waters also includes plants, grass and coral which grow and live underwater. It is estimated that 50-80% of Earth's oxygen is generated by the oceans. I know this is a reservoir but the plant life would be just as important to keep that water safe for the animals in it and therefore we'll be able to drink that water safely too.",

You can't have a \"partially effective\" dam. It either works to 100% or 0%.\n\n3. dams with such damage can't be \"repaired\" you have to rebuild them from scratch.\n\n4. The fact is that the surrounding ecosystem adapted to that setup for the last 80 years!

However, in that time any newly established life that cannot live submerged will die.   Sure animals can run away and build new homes, but plants cannot. \"80 years\" , sure - and it only took a few years for the reservoir to fill.  \n\nYes, it is always bad to have such large fluctuations in local environments.  I agree.  It is a problem. I just find the article to be a bit hyperbolic and lacking in the facts or research. \n\nI am also bothered by the fact that the article assumes the position that humans building the dam was somehow a blessing to local ecology.   Even though environmental activists and scientists protested the building of the dam and HEPS 2.  Do not misinterpret this as me saying \"it's good that the dam was destroyed\".  I am merely pointing out the logical fallacies of the article and some of the conclusions here. \n\nLife finds a way and while some life will be eliminated as the reservoir drains, new life will take its place and vice versa.\n\n2) example of small subsurface dam https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Schematic-diagram-of-subsurface-dam_fig2_225958278\n\nHowever, regarding the dam, there has not been a full analysis of the actual damage to the dam.  And I am not sure that a \"partial dam\" does nothing.  In fact all dams are \"partial\" dams in that they let water through (via gates) or over the dam (via fixed non mechanical dams) when it reaches a set level.  \n\nThe height of the dam is 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft)\n\nFrom my understanding the dam was not destroyed down to the foundation or river bed.   We will have to see what remains of the dam under the current water line to determine how much water will be held back and what that means for the eventual level of the reservoir.  \n\nSure, as the underlying structure is partially damaged it may erode faster as water flows over it, however the established timeline for this erosion is also not established as there has not been a full assessment of the state of the dam.\n\nTo say that a partial dam does not work invalidates everything that beavers do and all dams which allow water to flow over the dam rather than through gates.\n\nThis would be the latter.  I'm interested in any analysis regarding the remaining structure of the dam after the breach.   I haven't found any information online, just tweets etc that I have not been able to corroborate.  If you know of any I'd be thankful. \n\nI want to wrap this up by saying - yes, fuck Russia for causing this disaster.  But let's still have an open, honest, and rational discussion.",

Otherwise, it says what we know: All living things will die.\n\nIt\u2019s great if teaching a logical proof, not great in explaining what was important about this article. It\u2019s an ecological tragedy with a headline that\u2019s as watered down as the now destroyed feeding pools.",

Without knowing the specifics of why the ecologists believe this to be true, I would recommend researching any recent environmental factors or pollution events that may have caused harm to the reservoir's ecosystem. It's important to understand the delicate balance of our planet's ecosystems and take steps to protect them.",

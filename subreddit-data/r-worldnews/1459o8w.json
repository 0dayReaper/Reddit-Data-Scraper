(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; According to the indictment, the man also maintained contact with another Turkish national who was sentenced to prison in Germany in 2016 for fundraising for the PKK. The PKK took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984 and is considered a terrorist group by Ankara, the European Union and the United States.\n\n&gt; In December 2022, Sweden extradited a man who had been convicted of being a PKK member in Turkey before seeking asylum abroad. On Wednesday, Sweden&amp;#039;s Supreme Court approved the extradition of another convicted PKK supporter to Turkey.\n\n&gt; Many PKK supporters have found refuge in Sweden and in recent months have staged protests against joining NATO. Sweden and Turkey are due to resume talks over Sweden&amp;#039;s NATO membership bid next week.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1459ydz/sweden_charges_suspected_fundraiser_for_kurdish/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688363 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Sweden**^#1 **PKK**^#2 **man**^#3 **support**^#4 **NATO**^#5",

If you're  choosing to go on such a path, you have to understand the only \"reward\" you are gonna get is a healthy mind, and body and that's it nothing more. \n\nI really believe If you're at the gym because you truly think that's gonna get you laid or any semblance of attention from potential suitors you're not truly on a self improvement path and getting buff solely for that isn't going get you anywhere or fix any deeprooted issues that prevent you from having fruitful relationships with anyone in the first place. \n\nI've personally observed incel types at the gym who truly believe they are entitled to female attention or even general respect from other folk for the \"work\" they put in at the gym. And when they don't get what they feel they are entitled to for that work they might get super resentful and that's when it can get scary sometimes.",

Your hand slipping means you hit someone in the heat of the moment, it implies the lowest degree of accountability for the perpetrator since the physical \"reflex\" of their hand\" slipping\" was caused by someone else making them so angry they lost control of their impulses. \n\nThis term was used on purpose because if you want to make someone admit to some fucked up shit, you need to make the stakes really low for them, including not threatening their self-image in regards to how you frame the question. If you've ever watched a murder suspect be interrogated, then you'll see whoever is leading the interrogation sympathize with them, ask compassionate questions, be understanding, use very non-judgemental language. \n\n\"Has my hand ever slipped? - Yes. I can't allow her to disrespect me in front of my brother\" \n\n\"Have I ever been physically abusive? - No. I'm not abusive.\"",

The answer is: *self-image*. You always have to remember one very important thing and a lot going on in the world will make sense to you: no one is the villain in their own story. \nSo if you're trying to get an accurate picture of people's true behavior and beliefs, you HAVE to ask about it in a way that doesn't jeopardize the way they want to see themselves. You want to know how they feel about using violence to control a partner, not how they feel about being called violent because the answers would vary extremely. \n\n\"one's hand slips\" implies an involuntary physical reflex that was triggered, in the heat of the moment, by someone else's actions. The woman caused the reflex, it was an automatic response to her disrespecting him, making him angry, that's their perspective, that's why they have no issue admitting to it.",

In bigger cities you have schools where children of immigrants make up to 50~80% of kids going there, these come from households that also brought over their problematic views on women, homosexuality etc. and obviously this gets taught to these children at home. Adding to that is that these kids don\u2019t even speak German at home, so they already come with a disadvantage, do bad in school, get excluded and eventually lash out. I recall a news article where ~~a majority~~ one-third of first graders (of a school in ludwigshafen) have to repeat first grade because they started school with 0 German skills. In smaller cities and towns the immigration rate isn\u2019t as high, but the smaller the town the more right leaning it is and there you have all the conspiracy nuts and people that value the \"traditional family\" where the man works all day and the woman stays at home and only lives to serve him.\n\nBasically in bigger cities you get imported homophobia and sexism while in smaller cities you get internalized homophobia and sexism - and I have no idea how to get out of this situation honestly. We don\u2019t have a left-leaning party that\u2019s actually competent, we have a centrist party that promises the moon and doesn\u2019t do anything and the Conservative party is looking to keep up the status quo while also trying to get as many votes from right leaning voters as possible, meanwhile the \"we're totally not nazis\" party grows more and more in popularity. This whole situation is honestly completely fucked and I honestly don\u2019t even know who I would vote for because, literally, all available options are terrible and none offer a viable solution other than \"deport immigrants\".",

Second, they corrected the statistic by overrepresenting people with no school degree (arguing that people with higher degree are more tech savvy and therefore overrepresented in online studies), which I am not sure is that true anymore for younger generations. This would potentially also overrepresent migrant groups, which often come from more conservative society's.\n\nI would have liked to see a split between corrected/not corrected results to see how much this impacted.\n\n\nAnd finally... this is not a to discredit anyone :but the group financing the study are a woman/child rights charity non profit (which I also donate to), so they an interest to shine the \"brightest\" light on the topic at heart.",

And drawing conclusions from a fundamentally flawed data set will always result in fundamentally flawed data.\n\nI'm not saying they're results are necessarily wrong, just that their methods were too flawed to draw any useful conclusions from. I went to college for this kind of thing, and this data set is so far from representative, it's useless. Well, worse than useless, actually, since they used it to draw conclusions that a lot of people are going to take as fact.",

That sample size is plenty to establish reasonable error bounds on percentages for various yes/no questions; the problem is in how biased that sample is, vs. a true random sample.\n\nIncreasing the sample size would do nothing to resolve the issues if the bias remains. People thinking that the sample size has to be comparable to total population size to give useful results is a very common (and honestly, frustrating) misunderstanding of how the central limit theorem works.",

Probably also publication bias since an online survey is very easy to do and we probably dont hear about the unremarkable ones. The fact that there was such a high degree of reported homophobia contrary to most other studies on German public opinion suggests it's not a representative study.",

Just like any other bullying or harassment. It's like the people who fuck with dogs and wonder why they get bitten.",

Men hit less but cause injuries more. \n\nWomen are more likely to be sexually assaulted by their own intimate partners and acquaintances while men are less likely to be sexually assaulted by same people.\n\nThe crazy stats on homicide worldwide is kinda insane.\n\n80-90% of homicide victims are men.\nOf the remaining 10%, 60% of that figure are women and girls who are killed are murdered by their own family members or intimate partner. \n\nThis reminds me of the same reddit comments about the sudden increase of female reporters murdered in the middle east. On absolute numbers it just went from 5 to 11 (or something like that) but the absolute number of men were 40 or something but increased to 42 or something.

The article doesn't link to it and neither the international nor german site of Plan International seem to have it indexed in a way that makes it easily accessable (if it indeed exists). The article doesn't even name the title of the study and further makes no mention on how the data was collected.\n\nI'd love to read up on the study, but I am quite sure that this is either misrepresentative of the findings (as happens often in media regarding nuances in scientific papers) or flat out fabrication.\n\nEdit: I stand corrected. On a first reading, there are some smaller issues in how the data is presented, but it seems to be an actual study. My disbelieve mainly came from how it was communicated in the media, as obfuscating how to find it quickly is often used as a way to reduce people who bother fact checking. Shocking, definitely.",

Have you ever asked a racist if he's racist? Then you understand what this study did to prevent exactly that outcome. \n\nAlso, no one said the survey found that a third of German men 18-35 beat up their partner \"for fun\". They found a third of German men 18-35 think it is *acceptable* to use physical force to **intimidate** their female partner to get respect. That paints a completely different picture from your sarcastic interpretation.",

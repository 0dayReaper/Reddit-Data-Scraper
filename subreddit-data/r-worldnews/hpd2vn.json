He quickly squandered this and now he is at 40%. Considering how inflexible his numbers are and how close the election will be, this is still a pretty big shift. \n\nTo me, the most frustrating part of the presidency has been his inability to do the right thing and not do the most short-sighted thing possible.

When comparing to any other President, we'd be freaking out if their approval ratings got anywhere close to below what they were before a crisis, but we're focusing on the absolute poll numbers here, imo, because a lot of the people who oppose Trump (myself included) have felt we've been in crisis for his whole Russian-backed presidency.",

They've spent the past 4 years wearing his hat, waving his flag, plastering their cars with bumper stickers and filling their yards with signs. On facebook, they've been sharing eight memes or propaganda posts a day every day for four years. Conversations with them always steer towards talking about him. \n\nNever before have we had a president who garnered such rabid and vocal support in everyday life, especially once the election is over. This isn't just admitting that you were wrong or that you've changed your point of view, this is admitting that a huge facet of your life and personality for the past four years was wrong, and that's a really hard thing to do. If you see someone who used to be ravenous for Trump and came out of it, don't give them shit and \"I told you so\"s. Give them support, and hope that they can spread their influence to other people in their group.",

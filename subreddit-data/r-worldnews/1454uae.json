Putin loves good excuses, or even just bad ones. It's like he has a psychological block on doing evil stuff without a facade justification, that's why the Duma works overtime to pass bullshit laws that allow him to do whatever he wants.",

Putin has to already help squash the last attempt... Lukashenko dying might just be the next catalyst.... But at that point putin risks a world response, if he invades (questionable whether he can, at this point, since his army is so fucked) .  I'm betting Poland will not look kindly to having more Ruzzkies on their doorstep, etc. \n\nI'm betting his play here, is to put the nukes on Belarus soil, so that when lukashenko dies, and theres a shot of Belarus escaping out from under his thumb, he can send in whatever measly mobiks he can muster, as a \"secure the nukes\" sorry of thing... And basically invade, but not invade, so he doesn't get a very harsh world response.\n\nInvading, but not invading is his playbook.  My guess is that this is the same move he's done for years. \n\nBut That's just my guess.",

Hypothetically they could be launched from any European country.\n\nVery true.\n\nI mean, there's a practical reason obviously, tossing a nuke over your neighbours fence is easier than launching an ICBM, but:\n\n1. extending the range of any weapon from it's control and operational center also means extending the supply lines that come with it, which is expensive.\n2. Another concern is security, nuclear bombs are highly sought after by terrorists, rogue nations (North Korea, Iran for example), and placing them on foreign soil, close to the enemy's border is just asking for trouble.\n3. Thirdly, you don't want a nuke to detonate in your neighbour's yard, cause it'll take your house with it.\n4. Fourthly, you look like a real f'ing idiot when the country you hosted your nukes with revolts against you, then trades the nukes for an insurance policy of independence, and then 23 years later you come back and invade them. (yes, that's the Russia / UKR conflict right now).\n5. And pushing more Russian forces into a country that was actively rebelling against it's dictator a few years ago, is not a friendly act, it is empire building. \n\nBut I suppose most of these things aren't of munch concern to the Emperor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; Hypothetically they could be launched from any European country.\n\nNot hypothetically. France and the UK are ready to launch ICBM's from their submarines at a 15 minute notice or less, with nuclear payloads that would impress even our Sun (aka end game nukes). These submarines roam the oceans of the world in order to stay hidden, and can hit any target on the planet. Together, the UK and France has enough nukes to destroy everything on any land 5 times over.\n\nAnd the UK and France together have 1/8th of the military budget of the USA.",

In regards to ICBMs, absolutely they can be stationed anywhere in Europe and have almost no difference in terms of range or effectiveness in deterrence.\n\nBut, deterrence is key, and distance can be a shorter range and quicker time on target than an ICBM as well for ALCM (Air Launched Cruise Missile) or SLBM (Submarine). If some madman has thousands of nuclear weapons and is now willing to station them in another country, have multiple closeby allies armed to the tits, and he may think twice before using any nuclear weapons.\n\nJust my take, but again, I respect your POV not wanting to have nuclear weapons, which became pandora's box with potential to end most life on Earth.",

Moving nukes a *little* to the west is absolutely crossing the line. \n\nWe are so scared by this insanely strategic move that we\u2019re now convinced Putin is a geopolitical genius. We have to give up while we still can.\n\nOk but seriously what is the point of this? The fact that your nukes are a little bit closer to the west will have literally zero impact if a all out nuclear war broke out. This is solely just a move to try and scare people.. \u201clook we\u2019re moving them to a better position, you better be scared we *might* use them!\u201d Remember when they put their nukes onto \u201chigh alert\u201d? Literally just a scare tactic that means absolutely nothing. \n\nWe\u2019re gonna see a lot more of this fear mongering as russia continues to get fist fucked by Ukraine",

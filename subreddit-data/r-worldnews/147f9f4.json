I am a Latvian, we have 30-40% Russian speaking population and Russia next doors, and I can tell you that there has always been friction between Russians and Latvians, long before invasion of Ukraine. But it's often that I see people around me to tie together Russian government with Russian culture and people. It's very important to understand the difference between those things IMO. \n\nA lot of brilliant minds are Russian. My own coworkers who are Russian were the most pissed off and embarrassed when Putin started and escalated the war.\n\nAs I see things go wrong in 2 ways, when people mix their sentiment towards Russian government and Russian people. \n\n1. They see Kremlin actions, they don't like them, and they lash out on Russian people who might have nothing to do with them, and might actually be on your side. In this case, a lot of Russians get alienated, as their government seems like pieces of shit, but the other nations are jerks too. \n2. (This I often see in international community) They see something of Russian culture, or achievements, that they like and conflate it with Russian government. From becoming Russian culture fanboys, they become into Russian government (Kremlin) apologists. \n   1. Often I see this originating from World of Tanks and Warthunder games, where people have hyped Russian tanks (I shit you not) so much that they root for Russia in the war. \n   2. Another type is the disgruntled Western kids who see all the flaws in capitalism, and start rooting for Russia, (which is not Soviet) although for some reason all the Eastern Europe which has actually experienced the intricacies of all the flaws in \"path to Communism\" ***somehow*** avoid Communism like plauge. \n   3. Last type is the \"traditional values\" type, who sees Russia as some sort of bastion for \"traditional values.\" This is more of a disease in post-Soviet countries. What hides under this idea of \"Russian SJW free bastion\" iceberg is that  mental health is fucked up. Instead of talking and resolving mental hardships, most turn towards alcohol for coping. Household violence is rampant. Its quite normal to get beaten up if you are openly LGBT. Hell, its quite normal that most of the parties end because some local gopnik wanted to show \"how big of a man he is.\" If you stand out too much, probably someone will target you, and so many, growing up in enviroment like this from childs age, indoctrinates you to just go along with whatever everyone else does. I think this also partly is a reason why Putin managed to consolidate his power before getting overthrown. Essentially, all of the Russian society is just traumatized, and I wish they would resist, but I don't expect them to, and I can understand why. \n\nTLDR: Yes. Don't hate Russians because you hate Kremlin. Also don't love Kremlin because you love Russians.",

In Latvia theres also a lot of pro-Kremlin Russians, and obviously, we don't get along with them. Its usually the older generation, or in high % Russian towns, where they don't exit their bubble, but there are also a lot of Russians who don't agree with the Kremlin. Mostly the younger generation, who has grown with Internet, rather than TV as their main source of info. Also more intelligent Russians tend to be anti-Kremlin, whereas most wife beating alcoholic no-lifes tend to be the ones going around, screaming vatnik gibberish. \n\nOf course this is a generalization, but still, as I have grown up in place where Latvian vs Russian tension has been high, and have went through hating all Russians phase, from my experiences, also hating them all is an approach which has plenty of holes and brings more problems than good.

Marx laying out specific steps like making a vanguard party after a revolution has led to a lot of easily co opted dogmatism in many communist movements.\n\nBut I also see many groups advocating for differing paths but sharing the term communism, which to me is a more nuanced conversation. I don't think the end goals of communism (abolishment of private capital) are impossible to do positively in the abstract, however the method as outlined by Marx originally definitely is impossible because of how easily it can be co opted. I'm very skeptical of anybody who advocates for communism without being able to articulate how they think things should be done differently than Russia/China/etc and how to avoid the pitfalls communist governments have historically fallen into.\n\nUltimately the biggest issue, though, is communists are about as cohesive a political group as capitalists or socialists. Imo the terms are meaningless without nuanced conversations (the question I outlined in my first paragraph I also ask in regards to conversations about capitalism, socialism, or nationalism, for the record).",

It's not just about war/invasion; there are massive brutal war crimes being committed against children, women etc. This doesn't solely come from the kremlin. Since 2014, russians have shown little concern for their politics. They largely supported the annexation of Crimea and did not give a damn about the war in the East. This gave Putin the impression that russians = vegetables and he can do whatever he wants. And he did. It is the responsibility of the russians, and we will hate them, they deserve it. I am aware that there are a few exceptions, but they do not change the whole picture",

Germany literally fought against the entire world and still suffered less causalities than Russia..\n\nBasically, Russia wins their war with body counts, not a superior strategy. It's pretty much what we see in Ukraine too. They're taking land by brute force.",

Hint: even worse than now.\n\nEven better if they don\u2019t invade anyone at all, but this is like beating up the younger brother of your school nemesis (because you lack strength to beat the older brother) and saying \u201cSee, older brother? You deserved it!\u201d. If you think about it, it\u2019s pretty WTF.\n\nAlso, if they really wanted to fuck with the West, all they had to do was improve the economy a little bit, introduce a little bit of welfare and laugh about \u201chow easy is to live better than the Americans.\u201d People in America suffer a lot of inequality and social conflict, and America has the greatest military in the world, it\u2019s WAY EASIER to win the \u201cStandard of Life game\u201d than the War Game against them. \n\nBut for some reason Putin decided that going the hard and bloody way was better than just sitting still, when sitting still actually gives you a real win in the form of prosperity. \n\nPutin, you fucking moron, peace is not only an option, it was preferable.",

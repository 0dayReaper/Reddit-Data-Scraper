When I was new to management, I found that I was being included in EVERYTHING. Our culture was big on just inviting everyone all the time to all of these meetings. It took awhile to navigate, but eventually, I was able to curb the onslaught somewhat by learning where my contribution was necessary and where it wasn't. \n\nI frequently still have 6-10 meetings on my calendar a day, but some days I may skip 3 or 4 of them depending on where my time is really needing to be focused. \n\nYou start to learn that if you can skip a meeting and everyone is like, \"oh it's no big deal, we just....\", then I start questioning if the meeting itself was actually worth having. If an email would suffice, do that. If a group chat can carry a conversation over a few days at the discretion of the parties involved, that may be more conducive and convenient.",

A lovely side effect was a huge reduction in Seasonal Affective Disorder because half the problem was that unless you worked near a window (and that snow in front of that window got removed frequently) there was a good chance it was dark when you showed up, dark when you left.  Adding just one more day where people got to see the sunshine made the world of difference.",

It's no way to live--becuase you aren't living. You're just working.   \n\n\nAround here, office work is about 45 hours a week because you don't get paid lunch. With commuting, it's about 50 hours all told. Everyone is depressed and exhausted. And yet, we waste a lot of time at our actual jobs (if we are high up enough to have a job where we aren't micromanaged down to the literal minute--no joke we have to report on every minute at the end of the day). So, yeah, human beings are organic creatures, they weren't meant to work like machines. That means we gotta take some time to run through a meadow or watch a bird, and then go back to whatever we were doing, and we can't do that with no naps over 10 hour days.",

He was very relaxed about when you could come in and when you could leave. He expected everything to get complete as quickly as humanly possible (research lab). He was also very understanding when things happened and got delayed. He has been a scientist of the bee 30 years now. He understands mistakes but he does not tolerate carelessness. \n\nHe changed his laboratory working model to a much more flexible system because of a few things: (1) Life is dynamic and we all need some flexibility which is okay (2) There are fewer mistakes made when that flexibility is given to everyone in the lab (including himself) (3) He feels personal growth and health is important so he wants his employees to have the flexibility to do those important things. [Which brings me back to his main point) (4) There are fewer mistakes when you give people a good amount of wiggle room which increased his overall research production (he was and still is a research machine). \n\nTL;DR: Scientist I worked for changed his working model to a much more flexible system because he found it increased his laboratory work output and made everyone happier. He actually looked back and found he could publish more research in a year with the new model when compared to the old model of work life. This model cannot work in every field of life unfortunately.",

Why are people working 60 hours a week and still unable to have excess money to spend?\" There's a problem and it's up to the working people to use their voices. An employees voice should be important. No company should be okay with unsatisfied employee. One unsatisfied employee can lead to more unsatisfied customers. If we aren't doing it for the employee, let's do it for the consumer. There's a lot of perspectives to look at",

If I got offered to do the same amount of work I do now in 4 days but get paid the same I would. And you can bet your ass my work ethic would be consistently higher. I think you severely underestimate how many of us do the minimum effort not because of the work itself, the workload, the work environment etc. - but because only having 2 days a week to live is shit.   \n  \nThe supposed \"free time after work\" is not enough to do anything meaningful. You come home exhausted and don't even have time to scratch your balls before you have to go to sleep again for the next day at work. That isn't living - that's hell.   \n  \nWith 3 days off, 4 days at work, I bet my life I would be more productive. Not for a short time, but indefinetely.  \n  \nNot wanting to work 5 days a week does not in any way, shape or form make you lazy but the opposite makes you a slave. People complaining they have too much spare time and nothing to do with it are mindless broken husks without any creativity, personality or drive in life. Even if I worked only 2 days a week I'd never achieve half of what I want with my life.",

Students didn't lose as much of what they had learned, and both they and the teachers got a week break every 10 weeks or so. The district eliminated these schedules a couple years ago and put them back on the traditional calendar like everyone else, I suspect to save money. It costs more to staff non-salaried employees and heat/cool when people are in the buildings more days out of the year. Such a shame.",

I said I have a 40 hour week in my contract but it's not tracked on time but on achievements so I do a 9-5 with half an hour of lunch break most of the time if there's no big things happening that day.\n\nShe then told me that that's bad because my employer expects more time from me. I told her I already am the top performer in my team and she replied with \"Well then your boss should look why they perform so bad. If you are working trusted hours it means you should always work more. My contract says 15 hours of overtime are included in pay every month\".\n\nThis turned into a lengthy discussion with me saying there's no benefit in forcing hours just for hours sake and the best for the company is if the workers do their work and are happy and she insisting that the  best for companies would be to force everybody to work 50-60 hours + a week because she knows people that work even more. \n\nShe then told me of a friend of hers that works 18 hour days  and only goes home to sleep 6 hours, if at all. And thought that would be great for everybody because, as she said, she is in HR so she basically IS the employer and should only focus on what helps the employer. When I asked her who gets the money in her company, her or her boss, she had to think a second but then went into \"People should work themselves to death to make money for others\" mode again.",

            "comment": "I've been saying this for years, and the research **continues** to show it:\n\n**REDUCE THE WORK WEEK**\n\n- Unions fought and helped bring into standardized law the right to 40-hour work weeks.\n\n- Today, we see rising productivity, stagnant or lower income-growth among the bottom-90% (only the top percentile earners have seen their incomes soar).\n\n- By reducing the work-week, you increase (a) Job Opportunities (b) Reduce Stress, (c) better work-life balance, (d) Reap the benefits of increased productivity, and (e) as is shown in this study, those workers are MORE EFFICIENT.\n\n**UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE**\n\nDid you know employers love holding you to your job because of the health insurance you get through them? That's because:\n\n- They can leverage this to keep your wages down while writing it off on their end.\n\nUniversal Healthcare means:\n\n- Preventative Healthcare, leading to less exponential expenses of complex procedures and less days out of work.\n\n- Happier people who aren't tied to jobs they hate for health insurance, but find what they're better suited for.\n\n- Increased small-business / innovation: Small-businesses no longer worry about trying to cover health expenses for their few employees (I've seen first-hand). Allows people to focus on their own projects and entrepreneurship without fear of dying without healthcare.\n\nThere is also a chance that this would drive up minimum wage laborers. It leads to less supply of desperate labor and means suppliers (companies) will need to pay their bottom-line more. \n\nA healthier workforce is a happy workforce is a more PRODUCTIVE work force.",

In addition to the very good points you made, money will be saved on healthcare when people are less stressed and have more time and energy to do things like exercise or cook a healthy meal.",

Friday translated to German is Freitag which pretty much means free day. A split of 4:3 looks so much better than 5:2. You look at the number 5 and you realize I work more than the double the amount of days compared to the 2 days on the weekend. I seriously hope this gets changed some day. It's such a chore having to get up early when it's still dark and then come home when it's getting dark. It's such a depressing situation in my life.

Who would've thought that?!\n\nThe 9 to 5, 5 days a week structure is dated as hell. It's leading to so much stress, people being burned out and tired of life itself. \n\nImagine this: actually getting 8 hours of sleep. Arriving relaxed at work without having to rush because you woke up at a normal time and don't have to go to work when it's dark outside. Which ends up with rested people being more productive and happy.",

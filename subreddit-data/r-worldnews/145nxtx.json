Loran was a teacher in a school in Baku, the center of the Russian oil industry at that time. Impressed by large, difficult-to-extinguish oil fires that he had seen there, Loran tried to find a liquid substance that could deal effectively with them. He invented fire-fighting foam, which was successfully tested in experiments in 1902 and 1903. In 1904 Loran patented his invention, and developed the first foam extinguisher the same year.\n\n&gt;Studies have shown that PFOS is a persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic pollutant. It was added to Annex B of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in May 2009. Regulations in the United States, Canada, European Union, Australia, and Japan have banned the new production of PFOS-based products, including firefighting foams. 3M phased out production of PFOS in 2002 due to toxicity concerns.\n\nJust a guess, but I'm going to say firefighting foam. The entire entry is worth reading if this is of interest.",

Several years later, the foam was traced back to the nearby Marathon refinery, where the company used PFAS-laden foam called class B Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) for emergency response and fire-training, beginning in the 1980s and continuing to 2018.\n\n&gt;One groundwater test at the Marathon property showed PFOS at 765,000 parts per trillion (ppt). And while that number may seem small, it means the groundwater below Marathon is 10,000 times higher than the state\u2019s cleanup criteria of 70 ppt for PFOS in groundwater. Current Michigan standards for drinking water are eight ppt for PFOA and 16 ppt for PFOS, although experts warn that even one ppt could cause negative health impacts.\n\nNow why is the PFAS so high at the Marathon site? What the hell is Marathon?\n\nhttps://www.marathonpetroleum.com/Operations/Refining/Detroit-Refinery/\n\nThey're a refinery in Detroit. So they're probably had hundreds of little fires over the decades.\n\nSploosh, there's a little bit of firefighting foam... so there's a little bit of PFAS.\n\nAnd now people know this is an issue. There, and lots of other places. Most of them have nothing to do with the military.",

The US uses carcinogenic PFCs on their bases here that have contaminated rivers, lakes and the ground water to the point that the levels are 7,700x higher than the safety limit of the EU.\n\nAnd they do the same everywhere they go: \n\nhttps://www.ecowatch.com/military-largest-polluter-2408760609.html\n\n&gt;Last week, mainstream media outlets gave minimal attention to the news that the U.S. Naval station in Virginia Beach had spilled an estimated 94,000 gallons of jet fuel into a nearby waterway, less than a mile from the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n&gt;While the incident was by no means as catastrophic as some other pipeline spills, it underscores an important yet little-known factthat the U.S. Department of Defense is both the nation's and the world's, largest polluter.\n\n&gt;Producing more hazardous waste than the five largest U.S. chemical companies combined, the U.S. Department of Defense has left its toxic legacy throughout the world in the form of depleted uranium, oil, jet fuel, pesticides, defoliants like Agent Orange and lead, among others...\n\n&gt;U.S. military bases, both domestic and foreign, consistently rank among some of the most polluted places in the world, as perchlorate and other components of jet and rocket fuel contaminate sources of drinking water, aquifers and soil...\n\n&gt;In addition, the U.S., which has conducted more nuclear weapons tests than all other nations combined, is also responsible for the massive amount of radiation that continues to contaminate many islands in the Pacific Ocean. The Marshall Islands, where the U.S. dropped more than sixty nuclear weapons between 1946 and 1958, are a particularly notable example. Inhabitants of the Marshall Islands and nearby Guam continue to experience an exceedingly high rate of cancer...\n\n&gt;One of the most recent testaments to the U.S. military's horrendous environmental record is Iraq. U.S. military action there has resulted in the desertification of 90 percent of Iraqi territory, crippling the country's agricultural industry and forcing it to import more than 80 percent of its food. The U.S.' use of depleted uranium in Iraq during the Gulf War also caused a massive environmental burden for Iraqis. In addition, the U.S. military's policy of using open-air burn pits to dispose of waste from the 2003 invasion has caused a surge in cancer among U.S. servicemen and Iraqi civilians alike.\n\n&gt;While the U.S. military's past environmental record suggests that its current policies are not sustainable, this has by no means dissuaded the U.S. military from openly planning future contamination of the environment through misguided waste disposal efforts. Last November, the U.S. Navy announced its plan to release 20,000 tons of environmental \"stressors,\" including heavy metals and explosives, into the coastal waters of the U.S. Pacific Northwest over the course of this year.\n\nLocal military bases must comply with the law of the land. American military bases in other countries often pollute the environment to an extreme because the US essentially operates above the law there. How the US doesn't give a fuck about polluting other countries isn't talked about enough, Europe and Japan will have to spend tons of money to clean up the environmental mess the US has caused in our countries.",

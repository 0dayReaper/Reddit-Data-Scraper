            "comment": "I just want to point out that the $3 cost is the target \"cap\" price for the Gates Foundation. In all likelihood, poorer areas will have their cost further subsidized down to free or nearly-free. Everyone complaining that it \"should be free\" is kinda misreading the point of this statement. They're trying to set the **maximum** price to $3 to prevent shady clinics and middle-men from excessively marking-up vaccine prices when the vaccines become available. $3 is not the actual price that people will pay in impoverished areas. It's the maximum amount.\n\nWhy is this important? They need to get the word out that the price cap is $3 so that, by the time in January or whenever the vaccine is available, the general public will be aware that the price is supposed to be under $3. This will help against markups and the oncoming flood of black market vaccine sellers.\n\nIt's smart to set an early, easily-remembered cap price on vaccines and broadly publicize it so that people can tell when they're being ripped off. It also has the side-benefit of psychologically anchoring people to the idea of a $3 vaccine in countries that aren't impoverished. The Gates Foundation and Serum Institute can drive down the price of different vaccines in the US and elsewhere just by popularizing the idea of $3 vaccines to the world.\n\nIt's a good, catchy idea: 3 dollar vaccines. It's like the 5 dollar footlong sandwich at Subway, which was catchy enough that it made people reluctant to buy from Subways that weren't honoring the price. I hope 3 dollar vaccines takes off. The Gates foundation maybe should come up with an annoying ad jingle.",

My visit took about an hour. They did an x-ray and a doctor told me they didn't see anything and asked if I pooped and forgot about it. So they sent me away with a prescription for a $3 laxative I could have gotten over the counter. The whole chat I had with the doctor lasted less than 5 minutes.\n\n2 days later I got freedom as it felt like my insides were falling out. \n\nAbout a month later I got the same feeling seeing 2 bills from the hospital.  1300 for the x-ray and another 500 for a doctor to say I see anything,  are you sure,  well here.",

Many countries who are capitalist (Germany, UK, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Japan, S.Korea, etc.) have a model of capitalism where citizens pay higher tax rates than the US to receive robust social welfare programs from the government (like universal healthcare).\n\nIt seems like many Americans are so indoctrinated into the American ideology that they mistake this for socialism. But with the very large majority of industries in these countries still being controlled by private business and a free market, their economic structure is still unquestionably capitalist.",

Continuously under pressure from US and EU pharmaceutical giants to amend it's patent laws, India still struggles to avoid overcharging and considering humanity over profits. Doctors against Boundaries and other organizations have stood up with India against amendment of such patent laws. \n\nAnd finally, how India maintains it's stand as the [pharmacy of the world. ](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/india-pharmacy-of-the-world-during-coronavirus-pandemic-shanghai-cooperation-organisation/story/407586.html)",

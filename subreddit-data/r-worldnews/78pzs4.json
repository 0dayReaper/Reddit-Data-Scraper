Some small firm connected to corrupt officials wins the government order for some work without competition (easily done by making some specific requirements and no time to prepare offer while that firm magically have everything prepared the same day). It hires subcontractors, pays them much less and keeps the difference. Profit. \n\nMore advanced schemes include owned subcontractors where you can hide more money and spend less. \n\nIt doesn't mean work won't be done. It probably would. Just slower and with much worse quality (less workforce, cheaper materials etc). \n\nEDIT: Hmmm, lots of experts in Russian corruption schemes who are also happen to be Trump supporters say in comments I'm wrong and full of shit.

            "comment": "&gt;Viktoria is one of tens of thousands of residents who were trapped in flood waters following the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. \n\n&gt;What makes her story even more remarkable is that she has been rescued from the floodwaters on the left bank of the Dnipro River. \n\n&gt;That's the part of the Kherson region that has remained under Russian occupation since March last year and where an estimated 68 per cent of the flooded territory is located. \n\n&gt;She says the Russian occupiers are doing nothing to help stranded residents, and that she was only rescued because a friend came to her aid. \n\n&gt;\"There is no help,\" she says.",

Molotov-Ribbentrop had essentially cleaved Europe in two; then Stalin underestimated Hitler and flouted the border by invading Romania, and Hitler underestimated Stalin and engaged in a full invasion of the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa.\n\nThe Soviets were pushed into the Allied camp out of necessity/convenience; in aggression and territorial ambition, they were always closer to the Nazi regime, and they were quite comfortable keeping a boot on \"lesser\" minorities in their outer territories - same reason they favor conscripting minorities for the meat grinder now. The Holodomor and Holocaust might have been different in process, but stemmed from the same disregard for \"other\" human life.",

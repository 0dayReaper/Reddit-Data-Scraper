[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Ice is made from questionable water.\n\nIf you are brushing your teeth make sure to use bottled water for that.\n\nDon\u2019t buy bottled water from random street vendors. Even if the lid looks sealed and the water bottle new. They have figured out ways of filling bottles with questionable water while having a new bottle with sealed lids.\n\nDon\u2019t buy fresh fruit of veg from random street vendors. They often spray water on their food to keep it from drying out and wilting.\n\nTake biodegradable antibacterial wipes with you and wipe your cutlery with it. Cutlery can be washed in questionable water.\n\nI\u2019ve travelled through India a lot and most of the time stomach problems can be traced back to water, rather than food itself. \nSo before you eat anything, think to yourself if what\u2019s in front you and what you are eating/drinking could\u2019ve possibly been in touch with questionable water and take appropriate measures. \n\nHaving said all that, India is a wonderful, fascinating country and I really miss travelling there.\n\nEdited to help with wonky mobile formatting",

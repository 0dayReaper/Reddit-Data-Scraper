The fact that that did not happen in turn indicates that those groups either did not exist or had not been provided with anywhere near the resources they expected them to have). Ukraine is incredibly resource rich, and as Russias economic troubles worsened those resources (especially the grain) could have acted as a buffer against some of the aspects of their economic crisis most likely to foment the kinds of broad public dissent that tend to lead to revolutions.",

There were attacks on the dam in November 2022 which could have weakened the dam and without repairs it would have lead to failure. Those attacks were by the Russians so either way it would be their fault. Until proper intel is provided there will be speculation to exactly how it collapsed but at least blame wise it will end up in Russia's lap.",

They started around april, put in even more explosives late fall (gotta be tons) and they raised the level of water to the max. It was very deliberate and planned. Drowing a few thousand uninformed Russian soldiers downstream was probably not even something the leadership reflected over because that's mostly just prisoners, dissidents, minorities, homosexuals and other undesireables that they want to get rid of and probably belong to a political competitor anyways. \n\nIf you want to understand the Russians, you have to think like Zapp Brannigan.",

The dam will stay at it's maximum level. \n\nAnd it makes sense to move the heavy armed units early, they presumably are slower to move. The infantry can presumably move out with less than a days notice. \n\nMore importantly, if your plan to deal with an attack across the lower Dnipro is to blow the dam, you don't actually need the heavy armour there. Those units can be redeployed to elsewhere where it will be more useful.\n\nThe plan would have been to leave those infantry there as more of a tripwire, to detect if Ukraine were actually crossing the Dnipro, then start a retreat and blow the dam, hopefully catching as many Ukrainian units as possible, and wasting Ukrainian resources.\n\nEven better, Ukraine knows this is the plan (because the lake levels are high) so won't even bother an offensive there, which allows Russia to redeploy as many units as possible to other defensive lines, and Russia can hold that line with little more than the threat of blowing the dam. Ideally the dam would stay intact forever. \n\nBut the dam was blown early, those units were never warned. Worse, the dam can only be blown once and their defensive plan is wasted. Russia will actually have to pull units back to defend that area, weakening the entire front line.",

There's no direct proof, and there cannot be any such proof, as the dam is Russian controlled, and just a few days ago, Russia instated a law that forbids investigations into accidents and terrorist attacks at dams and other industrial objectives for the next 10 years.\n\nBut the circumstantial evidence is more than enough. They placed demo charges inside the dam back in November last year. They recently started raising the water level in the reservoir to such a point that it was overflowing. Due to how dams are engineered, an external attack would have to use orders of magnitude more explosives than you'd need to blow it up from the inside. Russia controls the only entry point. Also, until the official story came in force at 7 AM, Russian TG channels were celebrating the demolition of the dam...\n\n\"But Russia also lost positions\"... This shows your lack of understanding on how Russian \"institutions of force\" work. Ever since Soviet times, there's a huge competition between them. That's one of the reasons why Russia is performing so badly - not only is the cooperation between the entities limited, but they're often actively sabotaging each other. The animosity between the LPR/DPR, Russian army, Wagner, Kadyrovites, Rusich, Redut is already well known. Perhaps less known is the decades long conflict between the SVR, GRU, and FSB, both internal, and with the outside world. Read these (pre-war) articles, if you are not aware of this, and want to get a starter:\n\n[https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2017/05/12/russian-intelligence-is-at-political-war/index.html](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2017/05/12/russian-intelligence-is-at-political-war/index.html)\n\n[https://www.marshallcenter.org/en/publications/security-insights/intelligence-and-security-services-and-strategic-decision-making-0](https://www.marshallcenter.org/en/publications/security-insights/intelligence-and-security-services-and-strategic-decision-making-0)\n\nMy point is - it's likely the GRU that blew up the dam, and didn't bother informing the army to evacuate - either because they wanted plausible deniability, or they just didn't care about the Russian lives that would be lost because it weakens one of their competitors.\n\nAlso, let's not forget that Erdogan (which has been somewhat supportive of collaborating with Putin) proposed a joint international investigation. Ukraine accepted, Russia refused this.  \n\n\nSoon after typing this, I read an article about Russian troops bragging about shooting down an Ukrainian drone... but the drone was Russian.",

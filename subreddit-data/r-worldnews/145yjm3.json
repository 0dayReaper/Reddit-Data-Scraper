(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; June 9 - The U.S. on Friday banned imports from China-based printer maker Ninestar Corp and a Chinese chemical company over alleged human rights abuses.\n\n&gt; The chairs of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China - Representative Chris Smith and Senator Jeff Merkley - said the action &amp;quot;Is important because it offers clear guidance to American companies for supply-chain mapping&amp;quot; but said forced labor like &amp;quot;Car parts, solar panels, rayon, and garments&amp;quot; continue to enter the U.S. market.\n\n&gt; The act prohibits imports into the U.S. that are either produced in Xinjiang or by companies identified on an UFLPA Entity List, unless the importer can prove the goods were not produced with forced labor.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/145yp2j/us_bans_imports_from_chinabased_ninestar_over/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688449 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **U.S.**^#1 **company**^#2 **labor**^#3 **Xinjiang**^#4 **forced**^#5",

Plus the European leaders are even more squeamish and cowardly about devesting from China, if we are to get them to comply we need to baby them for a bit.",

China is creating a hot pot of hyper nationalism and telling the country to prepare for war - the west is slowly waking up to this finally and thankfully",

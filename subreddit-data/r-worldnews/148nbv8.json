[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

All out war between China and Taiwan would functionally shatter the global economy; China would be sanctioned by virtually all the western world and the loss of Taiwan's superconductors would grind the tech world to a halt, and that's if the US and Japan doesn't step in military (the Taiwanese semiconductor industry are integral not just to the consumer world, but are also integral to those countries defense capabilities,) so China would destroy itself economically maybe even faster than Russia is doing. But also, Taiwan is exceptionally well armed and trained on top of digging in and fortifying for the past 70+ years, China could certainly take Taiwan, but the loss of life they'd take on the process would be insane, and that's on top of the fact that everything of value (ie the semiconductor industry) would be reduced to rubble in the process.\n\nChina doesn't rattle the saber because they actually intend to invade. They do this because they've been saying it since the CCP took power and made it a core internal PR piece. Were they to stop taking the same position, there'd be a lot of domestic blowback so it's easier to just keep *saying* they're gonna do it.",

As it currently stands, there is a slight majority of Chinese who support full-scale war for unification.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Drawing from a unique public opinion survey in China, we find that armed unification, or \u2018wutong\u2019, garners only a slim majority (55%) of support, no more than for a range of less aggressive policy options, from using small-scale warfare, to coercing Taipei into negotiating, to simply maintaining the status quo. \n\nhttps://cwp.sipa.columbia.edu/news/assessing-public-support-non-peaceful-unification-taiwan-cwp-alum-xiaojun-li",

They run war games about it all the time.  Unfortunately Taiwan isn't ready militarily at the moment to put up a good fight.  Deng was willing to take decades to bring back this CCP territory (as they see it).  Xi on the other hand has made it clear part of his legacy will be to actually bring it back.  2027 at the latest.",

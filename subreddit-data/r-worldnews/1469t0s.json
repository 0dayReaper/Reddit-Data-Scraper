Because of all the ways he lends support to Russia, whether it be allowing them to launch attacks from their soil, storing nuclear missiles there, and now sending munitions over, he has never once sent his own soldiers into the conflict. I think that just goes to show he has no control over the soldiers themselves. \n\nThere's a line somewhere for the Belarussian people. They'll let Lukashenko aid Russia in a lot of ways with their military, but they won't be forced to kill Ukrainians themselves. Yet at the same time they don't want to make another attempt to rise up against him for fear of reprisals from him and from Russia like before. And that's something I'm sorry for, I wish the west did more to help protect those people.",

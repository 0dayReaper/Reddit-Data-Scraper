Russians were in awe of \u201chard\u201d power.\n\nEdit: Putin was already in power, but I mean, part of why he\u2019s still there\n\nEdit2: remembering it now, it arguably didn\u2019t kill EVERYONE, and it was a pretty ugly situation with the terrorists apparently pretty keen on killing people. Not that I agree with the gas, but important to keep the incident in perspective to understand why people supported the gassing as a lesson. \u201cNever negotiate with terrorists\u201d was a very common adage at the time, worldwide. Russians felt the massacre was worth it to give the terrorists a lesson and reduce the likelihood of future attacks.",

So maybe you are right. \n\nThen again China is rapidly militarising and I am not convinced it\u2019s entirely defensive. Maybe it is just a defensive force to safeguard their economic plans but maybe they are just going to continue what China has been doing since roman times and slowly claim more and more land. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting to see what political ideas Xi hold and how it differs from his predecessors. He doesn\u2019t see modern China as a republic that started about a 100 year ago but as a continuation of the Chinese empire. That\u2019s why he is pushing for the new silk road initiative, why imperial history is getting attention again and why the Chinese army has been sending special ops forces to steal back stolen art from the opium wars from European museums and royal collections. Where this sort of history was once shunned it is valued again.\n\nIt\u2019s not as clear anymore as it once was but China did play a role in the opioid epidemic going on in the US, seeing it as some form of karmic justice. \n\nSo things are definitely changing",

Whether or not they actually do that, do it effectively, and *when* they should do it is obviously up for lots of hot debate. Or if they should do it at all. But there's evidence that they're a good force most of the time, except for the stuff in Central Africa like you mentioned. \n\nBut either way, Russia in that analogy is way too \"old\" to be considered a \"little brother.\" Plus, some UN operations actually rely on NATO or other regional forces as a proxy (when authorized) so you can see how that could quickly become an issue.\n\nThe US also contributes more to the Peacekeeper budget than the next three countries combined, one of which is Germany, and most contributors are NATO members. So... Probably not going to end well if they try it and find some loophole to avoid Russia's veto - at that point they may as well send NATO in.",

There is no \"UN army\", there are no \"UN troops\", there are not even any \"UN supplies\". Every peacekeeper and all their weapons and supplies are always provided by individual members for a specific mission only. There's no hoard of guns somewhere in the UN land.\n\nHonestly, the only major failure of the UN is that in it's pursuit of neutrality, it tries to be above advertising any of it's successes. Because then it's getting absolutely destroyed by populist propaganda and it ends up with people unironically believe stuff like how all peacekeepers are good for is rape. I'm sure the tens of thousands who are away from home right now, trying to keep peace among strangers, really appreciate this sentiment.",

If Russia attacks Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland, then NATO can and must mobilize.

Individual countries can go in or they can create a new alliance pact that then goes in, but NATO literally cannot because that is not the purpose of NATO.",

Even if ukraine is not an \"official member\" NATO can decide to go and it won't be able to be considered an escalation.   \n\n\nNato for example could go, push back to ukraine's border and only counter fire against any russian artillery pieces firing from russia and it would still be considered a defensive stance. We need to stop with this bullshit idea of NATO getting involved directly is an escalation that russia can use for justification.",

There was a point where I might have taken that side as well, but the reality is that NATO has already learned the lessons associated with its lack of action in the face of humanitarian crises. They can stand and watch while more ethnic cleansing and destruction takes place, or they can intervene and return order to the situation. \n\nLet\u2019s face it; if the US informed the world that they were taking control of Ukrainian airspace at 12:00pm on June 10th, then there would be nothing at all that Russia or anyone could do to stop it.\n\nChina would intervene if NATO launched attacks against Russian territory, but they would get a nod to enforce rule of law inside Ukraine itself. That would allow a ceasefire opportunity and ultimately result in complete denial against Russian expansion.",

The fact that he's threatened them since the beginning and has never used them shows that he has no intent on using them unless directly threatened.  \n  \nThe reality is that using nukes would invoke a strong global response from all nations.  It breaks the nuclear taboo and if countries can do that without response, then all countries will rush to get nukes and make the world way more dangerous.  This is why China and India have been very vocal about this being a major red line to Russia.  \n  \nCurrently, Russia's hope is the destroy Ukraine's desire to keep fighting, while attempting to deescalate things with the rest of the world.  Attacking the damn under the guise that it could be the other side likely would invoke condemnation from the world and potentially some new weapon systems but not much else.",

This was all started by an egotistical old man who doesn't seem to understand his place in the world, or, is desperately trying to cling to the way things \"used to be\" before his country changes beyond the scope of his vision.\n\nUnfortunately, as is true in all wars, the people who will suffer the most are the citizens who have nothing to do with any of this.",

This means countries such as China and potentially India (though the US could make exceptions in order to garner more favor with India). Sanctioning such large populous and economically significant countries will lead to further economic woes that the US government and people will not want to deal with, especially during an upcoming election year. Another problem the government calculated is that causing sudden economic sanctions against such countries will cause the American people to lessen support for Ukraine. It is possible that the Democratic party ran the calculus and that by doing such an action it might increase the chances of a Republican presidency, and if Trump or DeSantis wins they have gone on record supporting Putin. \n\nThere are reports of Central and South American countries cozying more to China/Russia too (well more like they want the advantage of both worlds and keeping the US at arm's length due to historical tensions). Which might cause further potential issues down the line, particularly exacerbated immigration and refugee problems.",

In addition to current arms commitments ....\n  \nProvide a weapon to take down Kerch bridge, the apple of Putin's eye.  \n   \nRemove long distance limits so Ukraine can attack inside Crimea.  Let Ukraine attack remaining Russian navy at Sevastopol, and remaining air assets at Saky and Viline airfields.  \n  \nWhen Russian jets launch missiles at Ukraine, even when over Russian or Belorussian territory, declare those particular jets as open targets for \"hot pursuit\" regardless of where they land.  \n  \nLow cost drones dropping grenades has proved effective at harassment of enemy troops, and occasionally destroys vehicles.  U.S. should mass manufacture for our own forces, and supply a percent to Ukraine.  Enhance with long distance (say up to 20 km) radio controls, encrypted, frequency hopping.  \n   \nImpose a complete land embargo on Russian forces in Ukraine.  Attack ALL trains that originate from Russian or Belorussian territory that enter Ukraine. Period. This is war.  (WW2 allied air forces were unleashed to attack all trains.)  Over time, this starves stranded Russian forces in Ukraine of ammo, food, military vehicles, and compels them to use less efficient trucks.  \n   \nReach out to former SSR republics, Kazikistan, Tajikistan, etc. NHigh level diplomatic visits.  Trade deals, advantageous to the republics, too good for them to decline.  Extend the broadcast range of Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty (www.refrl.org) to reach south east Asia.

Normally, you'd provide them with some training but it's likely they were just thrown into a factory with tooling from the 40s/50s and just asked to make ammunition. Unfortunately, this will likely mean that it's just a short-term setback until they resolve the issues.",

Just that, for example, if one were to fire that mortar round at a wall less than 20ft away, then theoretically it should hit that wall without detonating. Of course, that is not an advertised feature and nobody would be suicidal enough to try it. It is mainly a safety feature to prevent detonation during firing and transport, like you said.

Could be cammo netting or light foliage that you didn\u2019t think would be an issue when laying the gun line in, but then you get a fire mission that requires a particularly high barrel elevation. Or to be a bit more brutal, if the guy dropping the round down the tube messes up and doesn\u2019t keep his hands clear of the muzzle the round will only take his hand off instead blowing up and taking out the whole gun team.",

Many people attribute the Battlecruisers losses at Jutland due to lack of armor, but that isn't really the case. their citadels weren't penetrated. Their explosions were due to powder bags being stored in the turrets and upper handling rooms. The powder used, Cordite, would leech volatile salts that were very easy to light. Cordite is still used today as a smokeless powder, though modern formulations are much more stable, not to mention are not held in powder bags.",

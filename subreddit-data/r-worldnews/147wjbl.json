[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2.

I think part of that reason is that our Constitution and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms are both relatively new (1982). They are fairly straight forward and they're not open to wide interpretation as the US constitutions has become.\n\nSadly that doesn't make Canada perfect, due to division we are currently paralyzed in making changes to fix known problems with the Constitution and Charter. At issue is that you need a near super-majority to effectively to pass any amendments, so a small minority can hold the process hostage to get changes they want. It is why it has been joked that Canada could be the last nation on Earth (even the UK) to drop the monarchy as a head of state.",

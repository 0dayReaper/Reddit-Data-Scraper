It's a serious offer in response to what a commentator apparently said in the US media.\n\n&gt; \"I was pleased to hear one of them say they have a lot to learn, even from Nelson Mandela and from South Africa. If indeed they would like to learn something from us, we are on the ready to provide them with our own experience and how we were able to navigate a very difficult situation that confronted us at the dawn of our democracy.\n\nHe doesn't say what this very difficult situation is, but it could have been the Storming of Kempton Park WTC in 1993 by a group of fascists while negotiations between the National Party and the ANC were going on - with Ramaphosa being the ANC chief negotiator.\n\nI feel like we need to make this comment to avoid people getting the wrong impression. Especially the ones who feel insulted.",

South Africa as a country is a flawed democracy because there is no separation of powers between the Executive branch of government and Juridical branch of government because the President gets to appoint the Chief Justice which in turn has led to massive amount of corruption without consequences.",

His immediate successor completely fucked the aids epidemic there, causing something like 10% of the population to be HIV positive. Then you have President Jacob Zuma, the former deputy-president who had been fired from that post, had serious rape allegations leveled against him, and so many more corruption rumors, still manage to be elected president. If I remember correctly after like five years they had to do the equivalent of impeachment to get him out.\n\nIt\u2019s so sad cause the struggle of apartheid is such an inspiring story, but you\u2019ve had this very flawed government take over and basically squander so much good will.",

Mbeki wasn\u2019t terrible, he messed up a few things but on the whole the country was still doing ok. But when Zuma came in that\u2019s when it pretty much spiraled. \n\nI\u2019ve actually met the current president a long time ago after he stepped out of politics. He spoke at a charity event and he was amazing. That one talk sold me on him. Interestingly, if you know the politics, Ramaphosa was meant to take over after Mandela but Mbeki got the vote. Ramaphosa then stepped out of politics and went into mining where he made a fortune. He then thankfully came back into politics  and I say thankfully because the other party options were frightening.\n\nHe now has the massive task of rebuilding a nation where the economy was literally trashed due to corruption just before covid hit and then still have to deal with the pandemic. And still manage a party where 85% of the ministers are still corrupt. So I feel for the guy. He has a lot to deal with, Zuma, just like trump, left an absolute dumpster fire to put out.",

He may choose to not follow their advice but his choice of chief justice would be eligible for rationality review (a tool that often stopped Zuma and from an area of law that is very highly developed in SA compared to the rest of the world). He does not have to pick the strongest candidate but he most likely cannot pick one of the weakast or one who is not \"fit and proper\" or even one that is an irrational pick due to him/her not being in line with the values of the constitution/judiciary.\n\n\nWith that said, it is 100% COMPLETELY wrong in saying a poor choice of Chief Justice contributed to corruption significantly. Zuma corrupted the National Prosecuting Authority and disbanded the Scorpions to prevent his prosecution. The Chief Justice does not have much say over them as that is the Minister of Justices job. Thus, no significant corruption cases even reached the Constitutional Court during State Capture where a chief justice would have to rule on them and even if they did the chief justice sits on a panel of 8 judges all with equal weighting.\n\nSouth Africa's judiciary is very strong. It is the strongest part of the state. Unless you study the cases you will never realise how much the courts have prevented during state capture days. Our prosecution capacity was weak and nearly non-existent but the NPA and Hawks have been stepping up in 2020. It will take a few more years to build full institutional capacity and strength in the NPA and Hawks but the current teams that are prosecuting the state capture / Zuma Era corruption cases are going to be battle hardened as fuck. I can nealry guarantee you that if the USA decides to prosecute Trump they will seek at least some advice from us about how we have gone about prosecuting stage capture. \n\nBTW, check out how the USA appoints its SCA judges if you think SA's method is bad \ud83d\ude09",

It was pretty peaceful considering they were blowing up fast food restaurants before. The infighting between the different \u201ctribes\u201d has really zero to do with apartheid and what Afrikaans right wing groups? There\u2019s one political right wing party which garnered maybe 3% of the votes in the last election so yeah, not quite the 40 whatever percent the GOP got. And tbh, they are so diluted, they are nothing near what the AWB was.\n\nSouth Africa has its flaws (and holy fuck there are many) but the transition was as smooth and non violent as any country in that position could\u2019ve wanted. Because the ANC lost their way 20 years later really has nothing to do with the transition and everything to do with greed and corruption.\n\nInterestingly enough, trumps disastrous path is very similar to our last president, Jacob Zuma. The US is VERY lucky the \u201cother side\u201d won, SA wasn\u2019t as lucky but that\u2019s another story.\n\nThe US would do well to look into how Mandela handled the apartheid transition. The guy was an absolute champ! Ah the TRC, it may be exactly what the US needs.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Truth-and-Reconciliation-Commission-South-Africa",

If it was peaceful, we wouldn't have factions in the ANC of good vs evil, political party members killing each other for position of power, and the Marxists and Facist EFF running around spouting racism and destroying everything in site.\n\nSA is a breaking country, and has no place (not even in Africa) to be a positive example. If you are not a South African, read about the Guptas in South Africa and State Capture in SA.\n\nEdit: Our neighbour, Namibia (Nambia for you Trump), where they have an elected politician called Adolf Hitler, serves as a better example than South Africa.",

I can\u2019t tell you how leveled up I feel when I tell people I installed arch. It feels so good. The moment someone says they use Linux I tell them I use Arch because it\u2019s more authentic. Every time I tell people about Arch my hair grows blonder and my eyes bluer. I can feel myself ascending and my balls grow bigger. As a dark haired Asian woman, this frightened me at first and I quickly started telling others I use MacOS. But now I embrace it. I embrace the hair on my chest and the growth the gods of Valhalla have bestowed on my loins.",

There was a full out war in kathlehong and Thokoza not very many people talk about, and they conveniently forget the necklacing and murder of hundreds. So the ANC and IFP can both go to hell.",

Venezuela hopes that the acts of violence cease soon and the people of the United States may finally begin on a new path toward stability and social justice.\n\nAbsolute king shit in sharp contrast to the incredibly racist rhetoric that proliferated on liberal news networks like CNN and MSNBC with all the talking heads saying \"this is the kind of thing that happens in the Third World to Banana Republics\"",

The events that feel most comparable to this event to me really is the Gunpowder Plot in the UK and 23-F in Spain, neither of which were 'Banana Republics'. It's the belief that 'it can never happen here' that leaves people blind and deaf to methods to better fix their democracy. Academics have been warning about the undercurrent of American fascism and the death politics that American culture has been hosting, and the danger it poses combined with the imperial Presidency since Bush and Obama.\n\nIt's petty and exceptionalist, because it ignores the history of Banana Republics, it ignores the history of fascism, and it ignores the fact people like Henry A. Giroux and others have been warning about America's rising fascism for years and years. They haven't learned their lesson from this. They are still oh so confident and superior. After all, it could never happen there.\n\nEdit: catching mistypes. Won't catch them all.",

Trump is following this playbook with a strong loyalist faction. USA needs to be very careful to avoid what has happened in the past and look to de-radicalise the Trump supporters group or I fear history is going to repeat, you can't deny 75 million voted for Trump after all, with a good portion of those people think he can do no wrong.\n\nThe age old line of evil prevails when good people do nothing. The string of good people resigning from their government position over the last 4 years a prime example of this. They have quit their position that then allowed a fascist supporter to take their place. If they stayed and fight their would be less supporters in these important institution.\n\nIt's not the next week it will be the next few years that will make or break the USA.",

She's not able to work anymore either :-))\n\nIf I had cancer, it would literally be cheaper and less financially stressful for my family if I chose to kill myself rather than get chemo treatments. All of the adults in my current household have, somewhat jokingly, but somewhat seriously too, agreed to just die if one of us gets cancer. At least we have eachother and good sense of humor!

That 10 billion could have vaccinated the entire population 3 times over. \n\nThis country is beyond fucked because of the ANCs  governance. Their ruthless looting and disregard for this country or the black people they claim to represent. \n\nCyril himself is cowed by the corrupt factions within the ANC. Our parliament will table the land expropriation act this year which might be the final bullet to this pathetic excuse of a transition. \n\nIt's been straight downfall since Nelson Mandela left office.

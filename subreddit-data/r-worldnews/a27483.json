So not quite since our foundation, but definitely since the Gilded Age, which is a fascinating historical parallel to our current predicament.\n\nIt's funny too, because who else had their hands in the Congressional cookie jar but Oil and Coal corporations. The other players may have changed (Telegraph-&gt;Telecom &amp; Railroads-&gt;Cars) but fossil fuels have not. \n\nI'm quite convinced that if we are to have a semi-peaceful and complete transition to green energy and sensible science practices, then Big Oil and Big Coal must be systematically destroyed, if not downsized in all arenas. Verizon, AT&amp;T, Warner and Disney can all go too. I'm tired of these corporations who just leech public money to act as modern monarchs rich in capital.",

But I think we should pause to consider how much democracy contributes to a happy and healthy society. I suggest this because I stumbled across a comment today that really stuck out to me. The Korean peninsula has achieved quite a damning feat. It is the place one goes to if one wants to see what a communist dystopia looks like as well as a capitalist dystopia. \n\nObviously South Koreans don't have to worry about being rounded up in the middle of the night to face the elimination of their entire family... but it is far from ideal that South Koreans often look at a 60 hour work week as lazing about, that students are often expected to study every waking hour of the day as well as shedding a few sleeping hours for even more studying, all so they can work for one of like 5 companies that control a massive part of the Korean economy. \n\nLike seriously, the whole Korean peninsula needs some time to reflect on things.",

This is massively oversimplifying systems of government and voting populations under a catch all Democracy umbrella. By it's very nature we would expect democratic systems to yield different results in different places.\n\nA 60 hour work week can absolutely be removed under democratic governments, change is in democracy by design (though interest groups will always try to block change).

I can't imagine the amount of despair that you'd have to be in, to make that decision. To not only end the suffering of yourself and SO, but to also make sure that your kids don't suffer like you have.... Fucking horrible that people are put into situations like that and have to endure, just because of where they happened to be born.",

Whereas in the old days journalists would waste a lot of time confirming events with people who were involved, or otherwise had info on the event, they now have a MUCH more efficient approach.\n\nWhat they do is: they hire a couple of hundred aspiring fiction authors on fiver to write them short articles on news that may happen in the comming days. If any of the stories they produce match each other close enough, they are considered confirmations and published as news. This saves them a lot of time following leads and questioning people, giving them more time to come up with eye-catching headlines and finding empty spaces on the pages to fit ads into.\n\nThe recent AI improvements may even streamline this further, as they can simply use that instead of paying writers at all. Instant news at the press of a button!",

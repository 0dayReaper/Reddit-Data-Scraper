Natacha twitted something **eerily similar** saying *\"I will not commit suicide. I won\u2019t be bought off or drown in a bath tub, nor will I shoot myself in the head. So, if that happens: I wasn\u2019t me. Save this tweet.\"*\n\nheres the link  [https://twitter.com/NatachaJaitt/status/981971273004744707](https://twitter.com/NatachaJaitt/status/981971273004744707)\n\n  \nShe was found dead two weeks before she was scheduled to give testimony in court.",

More directly linked to the impact of technology, it involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled and directed society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite whose claim to political power would rest on allegedly superior scientific knowhow. Unhindered by the restraints of traditional liberal values, this elite would not hesitate to achieve its political ends by using the latest modern techniques for influencing public behavior and keeping society under close surveillance and control. Under such circumstances, the scientific and technological momentum of the country would not be reversed but would actually feed on the situation it exploits.\n\n\u2026 Persisting social crisis, the emergence of a charismatic personality, and the exploitation of mass media to obtain public confidence would be the steppingstones in the piecemeal transformation of the United States into a highly controlled society.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Zbigniew Brzezinski",

Prior to the internet, people got their news from a few sources. Now you can literally talk to anyone, anywhere.\n\nEdit: For those responses about controlling the internet, you are absolutely right, there are ways to control the internet. I see what is happening in Iran, HK and Egypt. I saw what happened in Iraq during the Arab Spring. Yes, it can and does happen. I can't really speak to countries that have a more authoritarian regime setup than the US. I can only speak from my experience in the US over the past 46 years. It hasn't happened in the US. The government does not CURRENTLY actively control our content like China. Yes they have the ability to monitor and probably do, although I doubt it's as actively as some people think. That's just that much of a reason to be vigilant and civically active.",

Better to stay in the shadows, keep it quiet and attribute any tilting of the odds in their favor to \"hard work\" or \"ingenuity\" or some other euphemism for theft.\n\nMy pet conspiracy theory is that the Business Plot didn't collapse after Smedley Butler exposed them. I think those corporate interests learned that they didn't need a parade to throw a coup. I think they did it quietly in the last generation. I think they might have won. The whole thing operates at the whims of the wealthiest capitalists, or at least it seems that way to them. They have their own society with their own laws and we don't get to see it. It can't exist in full sun or we would tear it and them apart.\n\nEdit fleshed out that last paragraph",

People who have infiltrated our governments at every level. This woman is now making a public statement in an attempt to protect herself from being actually murdered by said powerful people. This is all real life. This is really happening and most of the top comments are about the word cryptic. Fuck, you guys, can we maybe talk about how it\u2019s time to get our power back from the monsters running the show? They have bled us all dry. Literally taken all of the money. All of it. And then they prey on our children made vulnerable by a lack of resources. This evil is party blind and we need to figure out how to come together to fight this pathocracy. They are lying and brainwashing and manipulating us from the top down and if we cannot protect our children then no one is safe. With the surveillance state in full bloom we have little time to act.",

His car was ticketed for bad tags, but his car was backed in so the tags weren\u2019t visible from the street. Not only that, but he lived in a cul de sac in the very back of a neighborhood very far away from the main road, you\u2019d have to be looking for him specifically to find the house.

                    "comment": "there's also this case. sadly the investigation fell apart after one dodgy witness but everything about the other witnesses and evidence has gone cold too\n\n&gt;He told The Telegraph: \u201cI was contacted by a young man who seemed to be in his 20s. He told me he believed Vishal may have been taken by paedophiles in the Elm Guest House near Barnes Common.\n\n&gt;\u201cHe said there were very highly placed people there. He talked about judges and politicians who were abusing little boys.\u201d Mr Mehrotra, a solicitor who was a JP at Wimbledon magistrates\u2019 court until retiring in 2006, claims the man said he had already informed police about activities at the guesthouse, but had received no response.\n\n&gt;He added: \u201cI recorded the whole 15-minute conversation and took it to police. But instead of investigating it, they just pooh-poohed it and I never heard anything about the tape again. The whole thing went cold.\n\n&gt;In February 1982, part of Vishal\u2019s skeleton was found in woodland in West Sussex. There was no trace of his legs, pelvis or lower spine, nor of his outer clothes, his sleeveless vest or his Superman underpants. At the inquest into his death, the West Sussex coroner Mark Calvert Lee recorded an open verdict but said \u201cfoul play\u201d \nwas likely....In June 1982, four months after Vishal\u2019s remains were found, police raided the Elm Guest House.\n\n&gt;Dozens of men were questioned, reportedly including at least 30 who were prominent in public life and business. It was widely reported at the time that the raids were linked to Vishal\u2019s disappearance. The Times reported that the investigation had included the disappearance of another boy, Martin Allen, 15, missing since Guy Fawkes Night, 1979, whose body has never been discovered. The son of the chauffeur to the Australian High Commissioner, he was last seen waving goodbye to a school friend at King\u2019s Cross Underground station.\n\n&gt;Police at the time dismissed the reports as \u201cnonsense\u201d. Soon afterwards, lawyers acting on behalf of the guesthouse threatened newspapers with legal action if they continued reporting on its alleged activities. Martin\u2019s brother said on Tuesday that police should reopen the investigation into the teenager\u2019s disappearance. Kevin Allen, 51, said he had always suspected a cover-up after police told him all the case files had been lost in a freak flood.\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11239535/Father-claims-Scotland-Yard-covered-up-sons-murder-by-Westminster-paedophiles.html",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; Palestinians are reeling after Israeli police shot dead an unarmed autistic Palestinian man inside the occupied East Jerusalem&amp;#039;s Old City, where Israeli authorities have a history of using racial profiling and excessive force against Palestinians, specifically young men.\n\n&gt; Al-Halaq&amp;#039;s killing has been slammed as an &amp;quot;Extrajudicial killing,&amp;quot; and has resurfaced pain within the Palestinian community, who say they have long been targeted and gunned down by Israeli police and military for nothing more than being Palestinian.\n\n&gt; Al-Halaq&amp;#039;s untimely death has coincided with the May 25 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with many Palestinian activists and allies drawing parallels between Israel&amp;#039;s slaying of Palestinians and the rampant killings of unarmed black men in the U.S at the hands of the police.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/gu8zmb/protests_erupt_in_jerusalem_over_murder_of_eyad/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~492615 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Palestinian**^#1 **killed**^#2 **al-Halaq**^#3 **police**^#4 **officer**^#5",

But the moral values attached to civilization are specious: too often used to justify attacking and dominating other, less powerful, societies. In their imperial heyday, the French had their \u201ccivilizing mission\u201d and the British their \u201cwhite man\u2019s burden\u201d \u2014 the bearing of which was eased by automatic weapons. As Hilaire Belloc wrote in 1898: \u201cWhatever happens, we have got / The Maxim gun, and they have not.\u201d Nowadays, Washington claims to lead and safeguard \u201cthe civilized world,\u201d a tradition in American rhetoric that began with the uprooting and exterminating of that country\u2019s first inhabitants.5\n\n&gt;\"The Roman circus, the Aztec sacrifices, the Inquisition bonfires, the Nazi death camps \u2014 all have been the work of highly civilized societies.6 In the twentieth century alone, at least 100 million people, mostly civilians, died in wars.7 Savages have done no worse. At the gates of the Colosseum and the concentration camp, we have no choice but to abandon hope that civilization is, in itself, a guarantor of moral progress.\n\n&gt;\"We call agriculture and civilization \u201cinventions\u201d or \u201cexperiments\u201d because that is how they look to hindsight. But they began accidentally, a series of seductive steps down a path leading, for most people, to lives of monotony and toil. Farming achieved quantity at the expense of quality: more food and more people, but seldom better nourishment or better lives. People gave up a broad array of wild foods for a handful of starchy roots and grasses \u2014 wheat, barley, rice, potatoes, maize. As we domesticated plants, the plants domesticated us. Without us, they die; and without them, so do we. There is no escape from agriculture except into mass starvation, and it has often led there anyway, with drought and blight. Most people, throughout most of time, have lived on the edge of hunger \u2014 and much of the world still does.42\"\n\nRonald Wright: [2004 CBC Massey Lectures:](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2398911764) **A Short History of Progress**",

Statically they are more likely to be in poverty, statistically Jewish education institutions receive 5 times more funding than Arab institutions. \n\nI can also tell you it is a social crime here to say what I just said as it is a social crime to say the N word in the U.S. No, I am not exaggerating. My girlfriend was spat on, TWICE, in two different occasions when she talked about poor people suffering in Gaza and how Israel has 0 interest in solving the problem.\n\nWhen I talk about this with the average Israeli, Saying occupied territories (referring to the west bank) is treason for people, saying that is as if you hail Hitler as a morning ritual\n\nEdit: \nTo all the Israelis here this is the official site for Bearu of Statstics in Israel\nhttps://old.cbs.gov.il/reader\nI claim literally on every aspect, no matter what you will search, an Arab is clearly at the bottom of society. Disagree? Where, let's pull the numbers on where you disagree with me.",

Biden assassinates her and then is sentenced to border patrol. After the ashes clear, a round table of our most famous celebrities come together to figure out who\u2019s still living that could run this country from the smoldering ruins of the Whitehouse. \n\nPeter Dinklage then gives a highly televised speech about who among us had the best story of 2020 and its fucking Elon Musk. The celebrity panel unanimously votes him president while simultaneously allowing Delaware to succeed from the union and god damn it I\u2019m still mad about season 8.",

Then look at places like iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Chile, Algeria etc. The mass demonstrations in Hong Kong sparked a global political awakening, covid made it take a hiatus but now it's coming back and this time it's closer to home. Dont expect things to calm down anytime soon.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe widespread images of civil disobedience and millions taking to the streets last year undoubtedly reignited the festering unrest in places like the ME due to Arab spring, but there can be no doubt the the widespread civil disobedience we saw last year, no matter the cause, inspired people who are fed up with the status quo. That is all I'm saying.",

So were many years - not even to mention more ancient history. \n\nIt\u2019s an awful year don\u2019t get me wrong, but to say this might be the worst in history is beyond an ignorant statement thus far.",

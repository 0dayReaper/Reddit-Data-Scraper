Poland is saying take your bullshit back home\n\n&gt; Polish secret services assessed Navruzbekov as a person whose intentions and testimonies are unreliable and raise real doubts about the reason for his presence in Poland,\u201d said the statement.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe biographical data provided by him, his described professional path and the information he gave about Russia\u2019s activities \u2026 turned out to be inconsistent, in many places also untrue or unverifiable,\u201d it continued.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; Poland has deported a purported former Russian FSB officer who sought asylum in the country back to Russia, accusing him of lying about his past and background.\n\n&gt; Emran Navruzbekov claimed to have been a senior officer in Russia&amp;#039;s FSB security service in the southern region of Dagestan, and had recently given numerous media interviews about FSB operations and alleged misdeeds.\n\n&gt; The move prompted outrage from one of Navruzbekov&amp;#039;s lawyers, who said he faced the risk of jail, torture or worse back in Russia, and that the decision came as a surprise given that Poland is one of the most vocal critics of the Russian regime.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/144g59p/poland_deports_russian_man_who_claimed_to_have/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688186 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Navruzbekov**^#1 **deport**^#2 **Russia**^#3 **Poland**^#4 **Russian**^#5",

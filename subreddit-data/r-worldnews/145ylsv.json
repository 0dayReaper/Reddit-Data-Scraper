Ukraine have a competent security network and would be aware of this.  There is little reason for Ukraine to blow up the dam because the pollution, damage and lack of water for crops and people will cripple Ukraine for years, so it would have been suicide.  Apart from that sending in a Ukrainian demolition squad would be likely to fail; Russia was controlling the dam, if the demolition squad had been caught or killed it would add ammunition to the Russians about the Ukrainian government trying to murder civilians/acting like nazis etc",

Before satellite data, other common theories were a stray rocket from either side, or a natural structural failure, as the dam had been damaged due to shelling before.",

Media being CNN, FOX, BBC, MSNBC, GUARDIAN, SCMP, etc.  If I see some hard evidence like someone taking out their cell phone and posting online a tank platoon destroying the neighborhood AND I see others filming the same event from other houses and angles, THAT IS PROOF.  \n\nWhen I see CNN copying an article from another media source, how do I know the original article is legit?  Especially when dealing with some wild and unbelievable stories.  The January 6 attack on Congress when Trump lost I know was real because different media had different angles and there were individuals on the ground uploading their own personal content to Twitter.  That's real news.  When the Guardian says Putin is going to die in 5 months from brain cancer, I need more proof like brain scans and a legit statement from his doctor.  The problem I sadly see on Reddit are the articles like Putin dying from brain cancer.  It's an unproven story piece by a major media corporation made to drive more discussion pieces about something that may or may not be real.  I'm becoming more skeptical of news these days when things seem to be getting stranger every day bordering the edge of fiction.  I love a good discussion like the thousands of others on Reddit, but for the past year I've spent most of my time in a day discussing and reading stuff that ultimately was created to waste time and money.\n\nAsk yourself this next time you read an article, \"Is there a paywall?\" If the world is going to end tomorrow in hellfire and brimstone, shouldn't that news be free?",

I'm not saying Ukraine did anything wrong - I'm just saying that it's surprising how little we know about Nordstream given all of the surveillance.   I live on Gotland in the middle of the Baltic so this is all very close to home. \n\nThere is also clear motive.   It doesn't make me think any less of Ukraine if they did it.  \n\nThat said, it's very unclear what happened and that report regarding the rented yacht / sabotage has lots of holes and many unanswered questions.\n\nJust to add to this, Ukraine may have had prior plans to do this (based on the wapo report) but this is also grain of salt territory as governments prepare for all kinds of contingencies.\n\nIt could just as easily been any of the other accused parties and it's really shocking that we don't know more.  I mean... I'm sure someone knows more... But for some reason they're not telling us.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why I am not so certain that it was Russia.    If it was, and any western country even had partial intelligence, we'd see much more finger pointing at Russia.   Not to mention that Russia would definitely be biting off their nose on that one... Doesn't make a LOT of sense. \n\nIf it was Ukraine, I can see why they might withold the info as they are afraid it might paint Ukraine as a \"terrorist state\" etc which could undermine western support.\n\nFinally, if it was any western government or party they may also want to cover it up and allow people to continue to speculate if it was Russia. \n\nSuch a frustrating mystery. I feel like we deserve to know.  Especially as I live on Gotland in the middle of all of this.",

I'm on Ukraine's side here, but it does make sense for them to sabotage those lines to hasten Western support and slow finances to Russia. At the time, I believe there was very slow momentum in sending weapons and ammo to Ukraine and without that support, Ukraine would not be fighting nearly as strong as they currently are. I believe it could be justified as a necessary action that they took to save their country when bureaucracy and politics was wasting time. If support didn't get to them soon, they would've lost more ground and more people and the chances of them holding their ground in this war was slipping away. The other countries chose to look the other way because they know that it is the lesser evil versus letting Russia win this war. War gets messy like that and it's not always justified, but in this case I would understand the actions of Ukraine and I still support them",

It will take decades and massive historian investigations to fully ascertain each of the attacks over the past 1y4m of war.  So far we know that more than 200k Russians have lost their lives but Ukraine numbers are scarce if any.  I. E. One sided news reporting\n\n\nIn the Intel work we work on confidence levels regarding sigint or any other source.  As far as people know it could be some Rusek wanting to be famous.  This could be seen as a viable target for both factions.  Ukraine to gain sympathy or some splinter cell Russians who are pissed of at all the loses and the fact that their country became a laughing stock or just plain old Russians being war crime lords who don't give a flying fuck about human lives.  After all in WW2 they went scorched earth when Germany invaded so they are not beyond destroying everything in their wake if they can't have it for themselves.",

Obviously there is a huge difference between San Francisco and rural Arkansas, and same between Auckland and rural Otago, so there is no easy way to compare at finer scales.\n\nThat translates to about $12.55 USD if you include PPP. Not as good as Washington State or something, but far far better than our $7.25 bullshit.",

Google is a thing, so you can't make up random bullshit and expect to not get called on it. \n\nWe have approximately 70% pakeha, not 96%. \n\nNo Maori are not second class citizens, dont compare Maori to Aboriginals, there is almost no comparison in historic/current treatment. They arent second class citizens, our cultural identity is built around them. There are socioeconomic issues but comparing our racial issues and yours is an insult to everyone involved. We all have so far to go in that regard.\n\nAlcohol consumption is high across the board, not exclusively Maori abusing it, we struggle with it as a society due to our cultural heritage but we're working on it. \n\nWe aren't a perfect nation despite what everyone seems to think. You can't really compare a massive nation like the US to NZ, it doesnt translate well. The US has so many more complex issues than we do that when you  try to compare them you end up with skewed results that make one or the other look like shit, when in fact were both shit in our own ways. Look at gun control for one. It was actually pretty simple to pass legislation after the Mosque attack here. That just simply would not work in the US. Admittedly you guys have dropped the ball in terms of gun legislation but its so wrapped up in your cultural identity that you can't just take everyone's guns away and have a happy day. With a country and government of your size, coupled with the fact theyre becoming more necessary than they have since the revolutionary War gun control issues become harder and harder to deal with.\n\nEdit: for more perspective, we actually have a smaller population than South Caroline haha",

It's just a way for an owner to justify paying such a low wage. It's especially fucked up when the boss splits everyone's tips equally, regardless of who earned what. Then maybe the US can start to get rid of the whole tipping economy, similar to how it is in Europe.   Then we can tip workers who go above and beyond, instead of feeling compelled to always tip no matter what. Although, I do always tip at least 20%, unless the service was terrible. I always empathize with customer service workers.\n\n*To be clear, I don't mind tipping, and I always do tip, I was just trying to look out for all service industry workers. I strongly resent anyone who doesn't tip, because I realize that's how these workers get the majority of their pay. If you don't like tipping and rarely ever do, then fuck off and stop going to places that rely on tips to properly pay their employees. You're just a selfish asshole if you don't want to pay an extra 20-25% but still demand the service.",

I worked for a medical insurance company. Deductible was $1000 per person (could be lower if you paid a higher premium) but once that was met there was no copay/coinsurance, so even the private insurance in NZ was more cost effective for consumers than here in the US. I remember for a young person (20s-30s) with no underlying medical conditions you could get a low deductible plan ($250 NZD) for about $150-$200 per month. My husband and I pay more than that for our medical insurance here even with my employer paying 80% of the premiums lol.\n\nAs for leave... that makes me miss NZ a lot. It\u2019s not just the maternity leave. All employers are required to give 4 weeks annual leave per year (or 20 days) minimum. This does not include sick leave, which was additional. NZ has about the same number of public holidays, too. I have a good union job with good benefits here in WA state but I only get 13 days annual leave per year. Doesn\u2019t feel like enough coming from a country that mandates 20 lol.\n\nI also took a significant pay cut when I first moved here. Went from $25 per hour at 23 years old in NZ (entry level customer service role) to $12 per hour in my first job here. Even after the exchange rate, that was still over $4USD per hour less, without accounting for the medical insurance deductions which I never paid in NZ.\n\nI\u2019ve since worked up and increased my income but wow, I miss New Zealand.",

Renting in those cities is absurd.\n\nBuying a home is something most millenials can't even think about over here, and Zs? Never gonna happen lol.\n\nAnd to top it off, our governement isn't bad at Covid, especially when you look at our neighbour under, but they ain't really good. In Quebec, pandemic restrictions are getting a little weird. And I am really super down for harsh measures, but what's applied right now isn't really harsh, but it's weird, definitely not backed by science, and most of the times it seems backed on nothing.

Someone posts a pro choice B opinion. Someone then argues with them. \n\nThe advocate of A will bathe in upvotes, and the advocate of B will bathe in the opposite. Passerbys that don't know the sub will believe the person advocating B is clearly wrong based on consensus. Other members of the sub will feel reaffirmed by the outcome of the consensus. \n\nAdvocates of B will no longer debate within that sub, as they get run out of it and downvoted. They then go to a sub that advocates B where the same thing happens to advocates of A.\n\nIt's a vicious cycle that leads to a lot of people with genuinely horrible ideas believing they know the absolute truth and that everyone else is an idiot.\n\nSpoiler alert; we're all stupid.",

I alone have a complete mastery of what is correct and what is not. If you have a differing opinion the obvious conclusion is either your foundation is incorrect or your ability to use information is flawed. But either way let's make sure we know whatever you've said is objectively wrong.\n\nThat aside it's noteworthy that the intent of the upvote downvote system was to promote posts that contribute to meaningful discussion, which also seems like a pretty flawed approach.

If they choose to sell their house because of this I'll be fucked because the rent market isn't great and I won't be able to apply for government support since my partner and I work 2 jobs and are technically not poor enough to get it and there's a huge shortage of state housing.

From a single man earning about 3x the minimum wage, I honestly couldn\u2019t fathom trying to survive on it; like many professionals my age I plan to leave the country so that I might one day be able to return with enough cash to actually buy a house in our ridiculously inflated market.\n\n2) the tax change cited is relatively pointless and does not effectively tax the rich. It is weird that an article today would focus on that though, and not far more recent tax changes more purposefully targeting wealthy landowners (can see my post history for more on that). \n\nThe unfortunate truth is NZ is no egalitarian paradise, or \u201cScandinavia of the South Pacific\u201d, as people like to think - perhaps we were more so 50 years ago but certainly not now. Policy choices designed to dramatically increase and then retain the wealth of the baby bomber generation ensures we never will be again. We have huge discrepancies in health, education and wellbeing outcomes as a result with most non landowning families now stuck in the poverty cycle. \n\nWhat we can be proud of though is our relative freedoms (particularly these days with COVID mainly a non factor), lack of corruption, amazing scenery (though we seem to be doing our best to threaten this too) and general safety. We are also good at sailing quickly and rugby too, which we like to focus on instead of those things above.",

The housing crisis in Auckland is really bad, basically mirroring Vancouver in terms of unaffordability due to foreign investors pumping prices up suddenly, leading to a compounding effect of existing landowners being the only ones able to afford purchasing houses.\n\nIt's a great environment to grow up in and the natural landscapes are truly gorgeous and very accessible, but there's a reason why 16% of the country's citizens live overseas. (1 million out of 5 million total)",

Storing money outside of China was safer than leaving it within the nation, and property was a very secure and financially fruitful investment. Housing markets all around the globe began to skyrocket in demand and price, driven by Chinese buyers. I personally know of Auckland, Sydney, Vancouver, and even Taipei being affected by this surge. I don't know if it affected Europe as much - you folks are a bit more distanced from the whims of China.\n\nIn the last 20 years, [median house prices in NZ have risen by over 530%](https://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Pacific/New-Zealand/Home-Price-Trends). There hasn't been a 'reset' or crash of house prices yet, and it's unlikely to happen for quite some time. Domestic landowners are the real winners here - New Zealand has no capital gains tax, so existing landowners benefit tremendously from the compounding effect of a large captive rental market, and just ludicrous profit from the housing market.\n\nMy parents owned a simple two bedroom house which they bought for about $120k in 1995. They sold it for $1.4 million in 2016, and bought *three* properties, living in one and renting out the other two. Each of those three properties are now worth around $800k, projected to hit a million each by 2023. My parents have gone from struggling immigrants juggling two minimum wage jobs each and attending community night school, to well off landowners with stock portfolios and (pre-Covid) holidays in Fiji purely through land ownership, not their jobs. I'm happy for them, but as a young college grad struggling to afford rent, it fucking sucks that I'll never be able to own a house until I inherit what my parents leave me. I count myself *unbelievably* lucky that I even have that safety net - there are plenty who don't.",

Lol nope. Tax hikes on the middle class. New Zealand has no capital gains or dividend taxes. Only people with employment income are going to be paying higher rates.\n\nThis article writes that this is magically going to be a huge boost in the economy, but taxes and minimum wage come with dead weight loss. That's basic economics. This is likely going to blow up in their faces.\n\nThis could still *be good policy* mind you, but the writing implies there's literally no potential downsides, and no potential losers.",

I say this is a kiwi that our country is fucked with a high child poverty rate, high rates of teen suicide, infastructure that cant handle the current population, housing prices that our own citizens cant afford and politicions doing nothing about it besides making an annoucement that they're gonna have an annoucement on it. There is a big reason why there is a brain drain, and even more so once the world opens back up from the young and skilled workforce because a lot of us don't see any future here for us.

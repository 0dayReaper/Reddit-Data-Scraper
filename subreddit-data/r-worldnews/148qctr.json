[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Nobody but Putin has believed the Russian military is anything but a Paper Bear for a while now, but I am certain Putin himself didn't know.  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, every military member overseeing anything of value has been bleeding their supply at every step in the chain through theft and corruption.  Not only had their huge USSR era reserves been stolen and sold to insurgents, terrorists, and freedom fighters the world over all while technically existing for accounting purposes(the numbers given to Putin), but every single post USSR contract was overbid and under(or just un)delivered or the contractors substituted so much garbage to increase their cut that the final product was worthless.  I doubt anyone in Moscow knew how bad it actually was, and anyone that knew even a small amount certainly wasn't going to tell Putin.  When you murder(or just fire) anyone who tells you bad news, you'll be surrounded by liars and only ever hear the best possible spin.  Putin was certain they'd have Kyiv within 3 days, and everything since has been temper tantrums from a scared old man who has to hear about every Russian loss from western media.  Russia would be targeting civilians whether they're winning or losing, that's how Russia has always handled things.   They deal with bank robbers taking hostages, in Russia, by killing the hostages.  That's how little Russia cares about Russians, they view everyone else even lower than that and all are valid targets.",

That said, I expect that between duds, orders not followed, nearly simultaneous elimination of sea based nuclear assets, and intercepts, it would still likely be an order of magnitude less than the carnage predicted by the standard \u201cfull scale nuclear exchange\u201d models. Tens if not hundreds of millions of deaths, but not billions. \n\nOn the plus side that means we would probably avoid the whole \u201cnuclear winter\u201d thing (even in a full scale exchange there\u2019s some debate on whether that would happen, since the models are based largely on firestorms caused in Japan where structures were mostly wood and paper, in a relatively flammable biome).\n\nOn the down side a whole lot of us would likely still be around to suffer the aftermath.",

People (and russia) calling it a hypersonic missile is misleading when hypersonic missiles usually refer to stuff which can fly hypersonic at low altitudes while also being able to maneuver (to some extent). \n\nThe patriot beating it is nice, but its been upgraded so much that its basically new tech, the PAC-3 missiles (what was given to Ukraine) for example were a huge upgrade over older ones, in the sense that the missiles were built with active tracking of their own, while also being smaller (4 per pod instead of 1) and more maneuverable. \n\nIntercepting a full on salvo of ballistic missiles from Russia is also orders of magnitude more complicated than intercepting the Kinzhal, both due to the much higher altitude and speed the warheads, not to mention that the ICBMs will carry loads of decoys and be launched in enormous numbers at once. \n\nI do think that NATO believes that Russia wont launch though, at least in current circumstances, which is why we see the gradual increase in support for Ukraine.",

There is a non-0 chance that Putin *isn't* lying when he says shit like this, but rather that he's so secluded and bunkered in that he literally *doesn't know* the truth and no one who reports to him wants to tell it to him. He's as fucked and misinformed by his own propaganda as the rest of his people.\n\nHe's still a psychotic imperialistic wankstain, but at least in these specific types of statements I would bet he thinks he is telling the truth.",

If you go scorched earth on your enemy even if they surrender then going against the civillian population starts to bolster the morale of the defendants. You need a reasonable way out for people you want to terrorize into surrender, but if surrender is as bad as fighting then the whole thing changes from \"brutal but effective strategy to win a war\" to straight up terrorism and doing evil for the sake of doing evil.",

Prior to this, they were hoping to come to the negotiating table after some kind of victory, but never managed to. They would have surrendered at some point down the line, but it's hard to say when. Hirohito himself still had to break a tie vote among his highest generals on whether to surrender after the **second** bombing, and he specifically mentions the bombing campaigns(conventional *and* nuclear) and their effect on the populace possibly driving the masses to revolution as 2 of the 3 reasons he moved to surrender unconditionally. \n\n**MAIN;**\n\nJapan was looking for a reason to surrender, yes, along with being extremely reluctant to go with an unconditional surrender. Even in early 1945 they were hoping to cause such heavy US casualties that pressure on the home front to end the war would let the Japanese hold some of their gains from the war. Emperor Hirohito was really hoping for a final major Japanese victory in the closing months of the war that would shore up their position at the negotiation table.\n\n&gt;Emperor Hirohito\u2019s path to making that political decision was scarcely straight. Through May 1945, he believed a major Japanese military victory must precede any move toward peace, or Japan\u2019s hopes for something other than unconditional surrender would be vain. He thus urged that Japan should launch a new offensive in China. \n\nThe Japanese high command, I believe their Navy specifically, were also practically unfazed by the **first** bomb being dropped on Hiroshima. Their own nuclear program had convinced them that getting a functioning weapon was nigh-on impossible, so the US could only have a very limited supply of them. The **second** being dropped on Nagasaki in short succession convinced the emperor that the Americans had the capacity to continue such strikes with some kind of regularity, and on top of the conventional/incendiary bombing campaigns is a big part of what eventually drove him to push for surrender. Even after the second bombing he had to come in as the tie-breaker vote among his war council. \n\n&gt;That voice was the emperor\u2019s. On August 15, that voice\u2014heard over the radio airwaves for the very first time\u2014confessed that Japan\u2019s enemy \u201chas begun to employ a most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is indeed incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives.\u201d This was the reason given for Japan\u2019s surrender. Hirohito\u2019s oral memoirs, published and translated after the war, evidence the emperor\u2019s fear at the time that \u201cthe Japanese race will be destroyed if the war continues.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-japanese-emperor-speaks\n\n&gt;On the other hand, as the summer progressed, **the emperor and other key members of the inner leadership experienced truly terrifying anxiety that the Japanese people were nearing a revolutionary moment. This was primarily because of the American campaign of devastating fire-bombing attacks on cities, and the increasingly dire food situation.** \u201cThe domestic situation\u201d became the euphemism these elite leaders employed to mask their real fear. They projected the real crisis would come in the fall, particularly when the rice crop was due.\n\nhttps://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/japans-surrender-part-i\n\nSo yeah, the bombing campaign was pretty much pushing Japan to the breaking point even without the nukes and leaders were just hung up on the point of trying to keep the Emperor as a position, which wouldn't necessarily be guaranteed in an *unconditional* surrender. The nukes being dropped allowed officials to save face on some level, but Japan really is **the** example of a nation that could have been broken by a bombing campaign alone. A lot of people say that Japan would surrender due to the Soviet Union, but that's not among the top 3 reasons given by Hirohito at the time.\n\n&gt;Why did the emperor decide to end the war? In his contemporary statements, he consistently cited three reasons. First, he had lost faith in Ketsu Go, referring to the long record of \u201cdiscrepancy between plans and performance.\u201d This statement delivered a crushing blow to the high command\u2019s whole rationale to continue fighting. Second, the emperor cited the increasing devastation of conventional and nuclear bombing. Third, he referred to \u201cthe domestic situation\u201d\u2014the burgeoning fear of internal revolt. Later in a private letter to the Crown Prince he did not expect to be made public, the emperor stressed Japan\u2019s deficiency in \u201cscience\u201d\u2014a euphemism that encompassed atomic weapons\u2014and an underestimation of the United States and Great Britain. He did not mention Soviet entry into the war.\n\nhttps://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/japans-surrender-military-coup-1945",

As they are very lucky to hit within 100km of the target in the best of situations. As a result randomly throwing missiles in the general direction of civilians is the best they can do with them. \n\n\nNow this info is from the Armenians that tested out the shiny new missiles Russia sold them. As they naturally very badly failed to impress and when the Armenians tried to complain, Russia shut them up quickly by threatening to stop arms sales.\n\n\nNote that Russia does have a few high precision long range weapons but they are few and far between. Which is also why the Iranian drones are so important as they are way more accurate than the bulk of their locally made weapons. However, they are slow, loud, and easy targets especially for hardened military targets.",

The Ukrainians themselves don't seem as amused, this is a peer-peer conflict for them. \n\nIt reminds me of the difference in WW1 propaganda styles. Entente propaganda depicted the enemy as fierce and bestial - something to be overcome through heroism. \n\nCentral Powers propaganda often depicted the enemy as bumbling and stupid. This is all well and good until you get to the battlefield and you find out that for whatever faults they might have, the fight is still actually really tough. That's terrible for morale.",

We were primed for the reality, because back home, you're invincible and according to the news, just kicking ass 24/7. Well that's what's going on, now.

The US has no replacement for them.\n\nThe US Army has tried and failed countless times to replace the M2 Bradley despite it being many decades old and there is currently still no replacement ready for it anywhere within the next five years.\n\nThe Javelin is about as modern as you\u2019ll get considering there are currently no plans for its successor in place.\n\nThe HIMARS system is relatively modern and the GMLRS rockets are still the most modern mass produced missile that can be fired from this system. The PrSM isn\u2019t a replacement for these missiles, they\u2019re replacing ATACMS.\n\nA lot of the equipment the US is sending is literally what army units in the US would be using themselves. The Ukrainians aren\u2019t being given Bradleys and Patriots that have manufacturing dates dating back to the 80s.\n\n15-20 years is usually how long it takes for military equipment to go from the initial conception through to research and development to mass production and widespread availability.",

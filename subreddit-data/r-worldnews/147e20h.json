And they've been trying for years to get rid of them, setting traps as they get off the train every morning with their enormous suitcases, raiding their warehouses, a couple of years ago they even started fining people from buying their products. Nothing has worked. It's run by the mafia and they have threatened violence if they are arrested, so the cops pretty much just make it a point to annoy them constantly, which really don't have much effect.",

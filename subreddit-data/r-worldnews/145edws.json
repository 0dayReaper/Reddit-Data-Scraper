They're known for their strict laws and zero-tolerance policy on drug use. And let's be honest, no one should be committing any sort of crime, especially when it's drug-related. It's not worth risking your life or freedom for a temporary high. So, if you're a foreigner living or traveling in Korea, just steer clear of any sort of drug use or possession. Play it safe and stick to the local food and sights \u2013 trust me, there's plenty to explore without getting involved in illegal activities.",

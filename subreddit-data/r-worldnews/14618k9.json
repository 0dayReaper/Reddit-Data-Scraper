You are doing it for several other reasons:\n\n* first, to showcase that you are still open for dialogue, eg. if Putin himself needed safety guarantees so him ending the war doesn't kill him.\n* second, to showcase **others** in Russian elites that if they offed Putin then Europe is ready to negotiate even with war criminals. \n* third, you can't trust any of his words but you can later view the actions (or lack of them) following these. \n* fourth, **two** can play that game. Scholz can very well feed Putin some interesting information of his own that might or might not be true. Politicians are effectively professional liars and are paid top money to spout bullshit.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; FRANKFURT, June 10 - German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Saturday he planned to speak to Russia&amp;#039;s President Vladimir Putin by phone soon to urge him to withdraw Russia&amp;#039;s troops from Ukraine.\n\n&gt; &amp;quot;I plan to do it again soon. It&amp;#039;s not reasonable to force Ukraine to approve and accept the raid that Putin has perpetrated and that parts of Ukraine become Russian just like that,&amp;quot; he said, adding he would work to ensure that NATO does not get drawn into the war.\n\n&gt; Russia fired missiles and drones at targets across Ukraine in the early hours of Saturday, killing three civilians in the Black Sea city of Odesa and striking a military air field in the central Poltava region, Kyiv authorities said.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1461aow/german_chancellor_scholz_says_he_plans_to_speak/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688457 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Ukraine**^#1 **Putin**^#2 **Russia**^#3 **plan**^#4 **Scholz**^#5",

It's clear that Chancellor Scholz sees some value in engaging with Putin and trying to work towards a more constructive relationship. Of course, there are plenty of critics who would argue that this is a risky move, given Putin's reputation and Russia's history of aggressive behavior. Ultimately, only time will tell whether this dialogue will lead to any meaningful progress.",

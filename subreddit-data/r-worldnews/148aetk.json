[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Second offence, another 10%. Keep it up, the government owns the company and the previous owners are directly impacted by the company's actions, but in a way legal and consistent with the idea of having corporations (all punishment is still only within the framework of the corporation).",

Readily available Western brands have now been replaced by cheap Chinese shit in malls. The few Western products that do make it come through Turkey, Kazakhstan, and others at higher prices. In every conceivable way, Russia is paying more for less as a result of these actions.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that everything is working. Sanctions can be bypassed with enough time and willing partners to invent new networks outside of existing monitoring. Things have certainly changed for the average Russian. Things likely have not changed for the average person in Moscow. Meanwhile, all the shit us Westerners are exposed to are stories from those in Moscow unaffected by the draft and sanctions.",

It halted non-essential imports and exports into and out of Russia, stopped advertising, and suspended all capital investment in the country. Nestle doesn't expect to make a profit in the country or pay any related taxes for the foreseeable future in Russia, any profit will be donated to humanitarian relief organizations.\n\nI'm actually rather surprised at how reasonable that is. That actually isn't that bad or evil afterall. It makes sense to maintain a skeleton investment, rather than abandoning all investment entirely. Even though they made the staying list, this is surprisingly more wholesome than the usual horror story I expect to hear that Nestle is currently committing.",

That decision remains unchanged and bp has no intention of returning to business as usual in Russia. \n\nbp has no operations in Russia. \n\nbp\u2019s nominated directors stood down from Rosneft\u2019s board immediately and bp withdrew its international staff from the country. bp has since withdrawn businesses such as lubricants and aviation. \n\nThe decision to leave Russia had a material impact on bp. \n\nbp\u2019s board took the decision to exit Russia only after a thorough process and bp remains confident it was the right decision. As a result, bp took a post-tax charge of $24.4 billion in its 1Q 2022 results \u2013 the largest such impact on any company globally. bp no longer reports any equity share of oil and gas reserves or production or of earnings from Rosneft - reducing bp\u2019s reported oil and gas reserves by more than 50%, reported oil and gas production by around one third, and reported earnings by around $2 billion a year. \n\nbp has not received any dividends or other revenues nor reported any profits from Russia since its decision \u2013 and does not expect to. \n\nbp is aware of statements regarding Rosneft\u2019s payment of dividends but it has not received any payments since its decision of 27 February. It has no expectation of receiving any in the future. \n\nbp continues to actively pursue the disposal of its shareholding in Rosneft. \n\nThe process is complex due to both international sanctions and Russian regulations. bp is actively engaged in marketing the asset, but its ability to sell is constrained by Russian legislation and the Russian government, who have effective approval rights on any buyer, as well as by limitations resulting from international sanctions. It was anticipated that this would be \u2013 and it is proving to be \u2013 a drawn-out process.",

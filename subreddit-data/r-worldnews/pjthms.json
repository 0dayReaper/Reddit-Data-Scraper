In essence, not much different from Roe v Wade.\n\nOnly 4 states have laws that allow abortions: Oaxaca, Hidalgo, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, Veracruz.\n\nFrom what I've seen in the news (can't find the actual court decision/opinion/writeup), the decision does allow for doctors to object based on religious grounds, but I don't see how this would apply to government run hospitals.\n\nIANAL, but based on how it's written, it's entirely possible that the jurisprudence will allow those seeking an abortion to obtain a court order (\"amparo\") preventing any 3rd parties from blocking the abortion, as well as an order forcing government-run healthcare to provide an abortion (which is how some minors are forcing the government to vaccinate them).",

The same way as it is in the US, where states cannot explicitly make it 100% illegal to get an abortion, but to get around Roe they simply make it *awfully inconvenient* if not *almost impossible/unfeasible* to get one, or as they do in Texas now, allow random ass people to sue anyone facilitating an abortion (but not to sue the actual person getting the one, presumably because Roe).",

                    "comment": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s supreme court voted unanimously on Tuesday to decriminalize abortion, a striking step in a country with one of the world\u2019s largest Catholic populations and a move that contrasts sharply with tighter restrictions introduced across the border in Texas.\n\nEight of the 11 supreme court judges had expressed support for decriminalization in arguments that began Monday, making the decision virtually inevitable.\n\nThe vote comes as a powerful women\u2019s movement is transforming Mexico, where female politicians now make up half of Congress. While [abortion remains illegal in most of Latin America](https://www.thedialogue.org/blogs/2021/02/after-argentinas-green-wave-assessing-abortion-rights-in-latin-america/), there has been a surge in demonstrations demanding more rights for women, particularly focused on rising violence.\n\n\u201cThis will not only have an impact in Mexico; it will set the agenda for the entire Latin American region,\u201d said Melissa Ayala, coordinator of litigation for the Mexican feminist organization GIRE. She called the ruling \u201ca historic moment for feminists and activists\u201d who have pressed for women\u2019s rights for years in Mexico\u2019s state legislatures, health ministries and law schools.\n\nFour countries in Latin America allow abortion under virtually all circumstances early in pregnancy: Argentina, Cuba, Uruguay and Guyana. Some nations forbid abortion for any reason. In El Salvador, [women accused of aborting a fetus can be prosecuted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/06/08/elsalvador-abortion-woman-released/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10) on assault or homicide charges, and face decades in prison.\n\nFour of Mexico\u2019s 32 federal entities have broadly legalized the procedure \u2014 Oaxaca, Veracruz, Hidalgo and Mexico City.\n\nOne of Mexico\u2019s biggest opposition parties, the conservative National Action Party, declared its [opposition to the arguments advanced in the supreme court](https://www.pan.org.mx/prensa/posicionamiento-de-accion-nacional). \u201cWe are in favor of defending life from the moment of conception until natural death,\u201d it said in a statement. It called for more measures to avert abortion, such as improving adoption services and providing more assistance to pregnant women.\n\nYet the decision was out of the hands of politicians.\n\nThe court was asked to rule on a law in the northern state of Coahuila that establishes jail terms of up to three years for women who procure illegal abortions. \n\nAbortion wouldn\u2019t instantly become widely available, but the ruling will \u201coutline a route, a criteria\u201d that states will use to change their laws, said Diego Valad\u00e9s, a former supreme court judge. The decision will automatically free women who have been jailed for getting abortions, he said.\n\n\u201cIt will have very broad effects,\u201d he said.\n\nMexico has the world\u2019s [second-largest population of Catholics](https://www.theyucatantimes.com/2021/01/religion-in-mexico-declining-inegi/#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20the%20percentage%20of,who%20claim%20to%20be%20Catholics.&amp;text=Protestants%2FChristian%2Devangelicals%20number%20is,points%20over%20the%20previous%20census.), after Brazil. Around three-quarters of Mexicans identify themselves as members of the faith, according to census data. But the government is officially secular and the church has been losing influence, due in part to clerical sex-abuse scandals.\n\nIn addition, women\u2019s groups and social media have driven home the severity of the problem of unwanted pregnancies, especially among teenagers. [More than 1 million abortions](https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2019/12/womens-abortion-seeking-behavior-under-restrictive-abortion-laws-mexico) are performed each year in Mexico, most clandestinely and in unsafe conditions, according to estimates by the U.S.-based Guttmacher Institute.\n\n\u201cThe effects on women\u2019s health, including the number of deaths registered due to clandestine abortions, and the number of child pregnancies, represent a profound social problem,\u201d said Valad\u00e9s. \u201cSo the attitude of most of society toward abortion has changed, despite the resistance of ecclesiastical authorities.\u201d",

They have small fangs but a red and very tender area will develop within 3 or so hours. This tenderness may turn into burning with dry, flaky skin, and the classic sign is a lesion forming that has a pale center and red ring around it during that time. \n\nIf you only got a small bite/minimal venom then pain will subside in a few days but infection risk is still there. Wound may take 3 weeks to heal.\n\nIf it is a more serious bite then you'll have an ever growing ulcer that will eventually become necrotic in about a week or two. This is a wound that will last months and need consistent car to prevent infection or worsening symptoms. \n\nUltimately, it is tough to know if you've been bitten but if you've seen them nearby (they're pretty distinct fuckers) or live in a region that has them then definitely monitor any sudden itchy or burning patches of skin and seek medical attention if it worsens. Keep in mind, it'll be extremely unpleasant and could result in a serious infection but the bite alone will not kill you.\n\nSigns that it isn't a brown recluse bite: it is raised, the center is red, the area swells (except some cases like on the face or lean portions of feet), if you have multiple bites, or if pus is present.",

All reasonable because COL is different. Yet here's the fun part!\n\nThe difference for the medical treatment is that it is 2,205 times more expensive to get in America compared to Mexico.\n\nEven with insurance reduction, let's say for example you had everything 100% covered, you still gotta pay your deductible (what you pay before you can use the service you pay for).\n\nAvg deductible in the US is $4,552 for a family plan. So you have to pay that amount *at least* in the course of the year. Even with that it's still 133 times more expensive in America.\n\n**So even an ideal scenario where the treatment is $4,552 in the US for it instead of the 75k figure, it's still 133 times more expensive than America.**\n\nFor every single American treated in this situation, is equivalent to treating 2,205 people in Mexico without insurance, 133 people with insurance.\n\nAbsolute purposely engineered disaster",

(Best friend got bitten just before a spring break trip together, so I've witnessed the whole ordeal firsthand).\n\nThe difference is that rattlesnake bites require special antivenoms to treat, whereas you can simply scour out brown recluse venom and damaged/poisoned tissue with a scalpel, then pack the hole with gauze and top it with a bandage. It's much, much easier to treat.",

Got the ER bill for $200.00 so we  think ok cool we know it is pricey but there is staff etc and it IS the Er after all so we pay it. A few weeks later came the hospital bill $1200.00. Charges were for a Bed and Tylenol and other stuff were on there the pill was $600.00. Called to dispute the bed etc and they said it\u2019s standard and the best they could do was a payment plan. The part where we just lost it was The doctors bill after that. We never saw a doctor or even a practitioner but the argument was that there\u2019s always a doctor in charge to authorize the treatment. We let that sucker bore itself into collections.

Say you need surgery - you do everything right and triple check with your insurance and the hospital to make sure the hospital and doctors are in network. You go in, get knocked out, have the surgery, recover, and go home. A few weeks later, you get a bill in the mail - just your standard co-insurance bill (even if you pay your premiums for insurance and even once you've paid your yearly deductible, most insurance doesn't cover anything 100% - they instead cover 60% or 80% of \"approved procedures\"). \n\nA week after that, though, you get another bill in the mail - for tens of thousands of dollars. You scramble and quickly call the hospital and insurance. Turns out that while you were unconscious on the OR table, the hospital \"consulted\" with an out-of-network doctor. You literally had zero way to consent to this, but you're now on the hook for the full cost, which is of course massively inflated due to the influence of insurance.\n\nSuch a great fucking system. I've had good insurance, bad insurance, and, currently, no insurance. No matter what insurance I do or don't have, I have literally *never* had a positive experience with our healthcare system (and I've had a LOT of experiences with it). I have no fucking clue how anyone could have any interaction at all with the American healthcare system and come away from it thinking they want MORE of it.",

Idk where you live but if you live anywhere near a major university they will more than likely have a dental school that does dental work for a fraction of what a private dentist would cost. Even with out insurance it'd like be 50-75% the cost of going to a private practice. I had a broken tooth in my 20s and a wisdom tooth removed by dental students who were supervised by a licensed dentist/professor. What would have been a $5000 with insurance bill cost me just under $900 without insurance. Might be something you could look into if your teeth are starting to break up. Good luck. \ud83d\udc4d",

I spent $25 for a 360 xray of my mouth, and $15 for a cleaning and evaluation with the dentist who will be assisting in my surgery with the surgeon. Probably have to drop another $15-$20 for medicine afterwards but all in all around $200 for a full on surgery. If I wanted to proactively take my other 2 out (I'm not going to, they're not even coming in and they are lined up straight, not crooked) it would've been another $25 each one. Dirt cheap and this isn't some sketchy dentist. Just a normal dentist who graduated from the big public university here and recommended by a friend.",

And it likely would've been a 3-6 month wait for her in the US as well.\n\n\nIt's kinda crazy there, though, it's clearly a big booming industry. You cross the border and there are signs EVERYWHERE for cheap medical care, cheap dental care, etc. etc. - we did a lot of research before agreeing to it but it honestly seemed more professional and higher quality than what we'd get in the US, in a way better environment for her recovery. When I say 4 star hotel room, I mean it was literally a hotel with a floor devoted to patients recovering from surgery with  that on call nursing staff.\n\nIt was not a joke, it wasn't sketchy, we weren't in some dirty back alley - it was, honestly, the highest quality medical care situation I've ever seen.",

            "comment": "\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s supreme court voted Tuesday to decriminalize abortion, a striking step in a country with one of the world\u2019s largest Catholic populations, and a decision that contrasts with tighter restrictions introduced across the border in Texas.\n\nTen supreme court judges ruled unconstitutional a law in northern Coahuila state that imposed up to three years of prison for women who underwent illegal abortions, or people who aided them. The eleventh judge was absent during the vote. The ruling is binding on other states.\n\n\u201cToday is a watershed in the history of the rights of women and pregnant people, above all the most vulnerable,\u201d Chief Justice Arturo Zald\u00edvar said.\n\nThe vote comes as a powerful women\u2019s movement is transforming Mexico. Female politicians now make up half of Congress, and an ambitious constitutional reform passed in 2019 aims to ensure gender equality in senior government positions. While abortion remains illegal in most of Latin America, there has been a surge in demonstrations demanding more rights for women, particularly focused on rising violence.\n\nMexico's bold break with machismo: women are now half of Congress and gender parity is the law\n\n\u201cThis will not only have an impact in Mexico; it will set the agenda for the entire Latin American region,\u201d said Melissa Ayala, coordinator of litigation for the Mexican feminist organization GIRE.\n\nFour countries in Latin America allow abortion under virtually all circumstances in the early stages of pregnancy: Argentina, Cuba, Uruguay and Guyana. At the other end of the spectrum, some nations forbid abortion for any reason. In El Salvador, women accused of aborting a fetus can be prosecuted on assault or homicide charges, and face decades in prison.\n\nFour of Mexico\u2019s 32 federal entities have broadly legalized the procedure \u2014 Oaxaca, Veracruz, Hidalgo and Mexico City. Abortion has also been available to women who became pregnant through rape.\n\nA handful of antiabortion protesters prayed and demonstrated outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday as the justices wrapped up their second day of arguments. The Catholic Church had expressed its concern a day earlier, in an editorial in its magazine Desde la Fe \u2014 \u201cFrom the Faith.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t create a huge setback just to please an ideology in vogue, or due to peer pressure,\u201d it urged the judges.\n\nThe conservative National Action Party also rejected the court\u2019s arguments. \u201cWe are in favor of defending life from the moment of conception until natural death,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nYet the decision was out of the hands of politicians. Under Mexican law, a supreme court ruling supported by at least eight justices supersedes state laws.\n\nAbortion won\u2019t become widely available right away, but the ruling will \u201coutline a route, a criteria\u201d that states will use to change their laws, said Diego Valad\u00e9s, a former supreme court judge.\n\n\u201cAbortion has been effectively decriminalized in Mexico,\u201d said Paula Avila-Guillen, executive director of the New York-based Women\u2019s Equality Center. \u201cAnd every woman currently imprisoned in the country for abortion can use this precedent to be freed.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many Mexicans have been jailed on abortion charges. In a recent study, GIRE found at least 500 criminal trials were held between 2007 and 2016, but it acknowledged that it was unable to find data for many states.\n\nMexican feminists occupy building, demand end to violence against women\n\nMexico has the world\u2019s second-largest population of Catholics, after Brazil. Around three-quarters of Mexicans identify as members of the faith, according to census data. But the government is officially secular and the church has been losing influence, due in part to clerical sex-abuse scandals.\n\nMexicans have also become increasingly aware of the problem of unwanted pregnancies, especially among teenagers. More than 1 million abortions are performed each year in Mexico, most in unsafe conditions, according to estimates by the U.S.-based Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports access to reproductive health\n\n\u201cThe effects on women\u2019s health, including the number of deaths registered due to clandestine abortions, and the number of child pregnancies, represent a profound social problem,\u201d said Valad\u00e9s. \u201cSo the attitude of most of society toward abortion has changed, despite the resistance of ecclesiastical authorities.\u201d\n\nAnalysts said the ruling reflected years of activism by women\u2019s groups who have promoted gender equity and rights in federal and state governments, health ministries and courts. Before the pandemic, hundreds of thousands of women join protests against femicide and labor abuses, in a burgeoning movement also fueled by the global \u201c#MeToo\u201d phenomenon.\n\n\u201cThe Mexican supreme court understood the climate had changed,\u201d said Denise Dresser, a prominent political scientist. She noted that political factors may have also been in play. Zald\u00edvar, the chief justice, has been under fire for his close relationship with President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. A congressional maneuver that would have extended the chief justice\u2019s term was recently dropped, after critics assailed it as unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThis is a way of recuperating his reputation as a progressive,\u201d said Dresser. \u201cIt\u2019s a way in which the court positions itself as a protector of rights, when rights are being limited or are being suppressed in other areas.\u201d\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador rose power as a leader of the left, but many feminists have expressed disappointment with his policies. He cut funds for women\u2019s shelters as part of a broader austerity program, and has expressed suspicion that opposition political parties are behind the women\u2019s movement. The president has defended his record, noting he named Mexico\u2019s first Cabinet composed of half women.\n\nHis winning coalition included a small party, Social Encounter, that is firmly opposed to abortion. For his part, L\u00f3pez Obrador has been neutral on the subject.\n\n\u201cWomen have to sort this out, the Mexican people have to sort this out,\u201d he said at his daily news conference on Tuesday, when asked about the court deliberations. \u201cWe have acted, in my case as president, with prudence, in a respectful manner, because these are very controversial, polemical topics. And we don\u2019t want to encourage any confrontation.\u201d\n\nThe ruling comes as Texas is implementing a law that effectively bans abortions after six weeks. Republican leaders in at least seven states are considering copying it. The Guttmacher Institute said recently that more abortion restrictions had been enacted by U.S. states in 2021 than in any year since the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.",

Later their bloviating shitbags said things like \"they were on vacation, just tourists\". The left politicians should have FLOODED the media and Sunday shows to call bullshit and show images. The GOP wins because they fight better, too bad that means everyone looses except them. Another great example? Sorry Obama you can't pick a SC judge too close to election. So what do the dems do? They turn into George Mc fly \" gee you're right Mitch,  sorry Mitch hey Mc Fly I need my reports\". When what they should have done is shoved it up his wrinkled sigmoid like he did to them when Trumpster Fire was King. Maybe if they had found a spine we wouldn't be where we are in Texas.",

Every late night host has taken jabs at Putin, and they don't have people tasting their food before every meal. Comedians and satirists (generally speaking) aren't in immediate danger, because their targets can dismiss what they say as entertainment and not the whole truth. \n\nJournalists, on the other hand...\n\n___\n\nedit: I wanted to watch this before I commented further. I'll just say that, while I understand how him being Muslim is notable, I'm just not sure it makes things any more dangerous for him personally. He's not actually exposing anything new, just taking jabs and sharing his personal takes on news and reporting that's already been done and has hit front pages across the world. \n\nHe might not want to go walking down the streets of Jeddah at night, but he's a comedian living in NYC with his wife and kid. When it comes to silencing opposition, I think Saudi Arabia has their sights elsewhere.   \n\n",

Plus, the original Streisand created situation is pretty damn hilarious in its own right.\n\nFor those who don't know the situation, background context and court documents can still be found [online at the very website that she unsuccessfully attempted to sue.] (https://www.californiacoastline.org/streisand/lawsuit.html) \n\nSemi TL;DR: Streisand tried to sue an environmentalist over one of his coastline degradation documentation photos containing her property. Prior to the lawsuit, it was downloaded only 6 times; in the month following her filing, it registered 420,000 unique visits. The crux of her argument was a breach of privacy, but, if I remember right, one of the key pieces of evidence from the defense was a recording of the Oprah Winfrey Show in which Streisand gave Oprah, and America, a far more detailed tour of her property.",

He only charged $5 per ticket, and he would take one of his topics and run the episodes through with the audience. Then afterwards he would ask the audience for help, advice, critique and what they thought. It was one of the coolest things I've ever been witness to in a part of, I got to be part of the affirmative action Practice episode. His brain just works faster than everyone else's, he was putting together stuff and taking in critiques and information on the fly and it was kind of magical to watch him. Much respect.",

Did you luck into being there that night, or was this a well-known event of his, or are you a Williamsburg hipster who prefers RAMBO to DUMBO and would never give an honest answer?  Haha, it's just cool that you got to see him basically workshopping his material.\n\nI went to Nick Swardson's first tour show last year in Dallas.  He was still working thru material, referencing s sheet of paper at the back of the stage.  That's not a dig - I was really appreciative to see him do that, because it shows he cares about performance and delivery.  He still killed the Majestic that night.  Sidebar, his show was like being hit with paddles in an ER for me; it took the edge off a particularly bad depressive period.  Anyway, cool yeah!",

If I like it, I'll watch the rest of the series. I enjoyed Hasan's work at the White House Correspondents Dinner so I have a feeling I might enjoy his work here.\n\nThe Streisand Effect in full swing here folks.\n\nEDIT: I watched the first two episodes of Patriot Act...I liked them!",

He's a little intoxicated, and a bit off (is it drugs? Mental illness? Unclear).\n\nThe guy clearly doesn't respect normal boundaries; he sits down across from you and starts talking. By the time your mates are back you've heard his life story, how he has 2 kids down the coast that their mother doesn't let him see but he's been trying real hard to get a job so he might get to soon.\n\nHe tells you his theories about the government, how they're all out to get him and about how centrelink really fucked him over. As your friends return he pulls out some cards, does a couple magic tricks, and asks you to buy him a beer.\n\nThat's Bob Katter.",

HIV detection and treatment has improved drastically since the 90s and even more drastically since 2000. There's essentially no way you'd get a blood donation with HIV in it. Using \"but what about HIV?\" to stop gay people from donating blood is just ridiculous today. It's the job of those collecting the blood to test it, regardless of the sexual history of the donor (since every donation should be checked regardless; there are plenty of straight folks out there with HIV).

As it stands the bill essentially went through unmolested and unconditional, which is the best possible outcome.\n\nSo the postal survey, expensive? Yes. Political theatre? Absolutely.

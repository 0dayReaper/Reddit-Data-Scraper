The fact that he's resorting to violence like this as a means of shoring up political power seems to indicate a domestic weakness that we in the West were previously unaware of. But now this; did Putin miscalculate? Do we not fully understand the domestic political context of these protests? Are they small enough that Putin can safely disregard and/or suppress them?\n\nAnd what of the American conservative support for Putin? It flies in the face of their stated priority of promoting individual liberty and national sovereignty. Is it really as simple as supporting international figures that Trump has expressed admiration for? He's expressed admiration for Kim Jong Un before, and I don't see conservatives rushing to the defense of NK missile tests. Or is it that they are now so skeptical of democracy and the pax-European project that they reflexively side with opponents to those two principles?\n\nIt's all baffling.\n\nedit: sum spelingz\n\nedit II: just wanted to say the responses to this have been some of the most thoughtful and interesting I've read on Reddit in a political context.

There's no economic, strategic or political goal to invading the whole of Ukraine, either short-term or long-term, which is why no one believed he would do it until this morning. I genuinely think he's bought his own kool-aid about how strong the Russian military is, how willing the Ukrainians will be to stand down, how NATO is dreaming of invading Russia and how he's the grand savior of Russia's greatness.\n\nThink about it: he just cut the Russian economy in half. In one morning. With more to come. You think Gazprom is happy about it? Sberbank? Rosneft? Those are companies owned by the government and operated by Putin's cronies. He used to keep their interests in mind, if only for the sake of festering loyalty, but now he's thrown away untold billions of dollars of value AND made those people pariahs outside of Russia... and for what? There's not even any popular support within the country, and it's virtually always there at the start of a war campaign.\n\nPutin's state of mind has been degrading before, but two years of life in a Covid bunker might've finally put the nail in that coffin. He's alienated everyone, including his closest partners, which is why I think he has no longer than a couple months left on this Earth. Some big business owner's bound to get pissed off, and since they're all bandits from the 90s they're no strangers to resolving problems the \"hard\" way.",

He had to make some deals, kill a few hundred Russians in a false flag apartment bombing, and appoint a puppet with some autonomy - but the hostile population is now a part of Russia. Some of them have been fighting for Russia in Ukraine for eight years. \n\nI grew up in Kyiv, as the first Chechen war was happening I watched it on the news and thought it was so awful. Then one day my dad brought one of his friends from the army and later from some business dealings to one of our apartments. He and his wife were refugees from Grozny. Their home had been destroyed and they used their remaining savings to bribe various border guards and make their way to Ukraine. \n\nThey were very nice people, Rashid and Zuleika. I felt so bad for them, seeing the bombing on TV and how brave they must have been to leave everything. They were so grateful, I still have a gift Rashid gave me when they were able to find permanent housing - a Sony tape cassette Walkman. At the time an expensive and rare item in post Soviet Ukraine. I kept it for some sentimental reason. I have no idea what happened to them, last I heard he had bought a former kindergarten and turned it into a successful cafe. Chechnya is now a brutal dictatorship under Putin\u2019s aegis and his puppet Ramzan Kadyrov. \n\nI never thought I\u2019d see my friends in Kyiv become refugees themselves. But here we are. There\u2019s a Ukrainian equivalent to Rashid somewhere out there and it breaks my heart. I applaud these protesters risking the beatings of the Russian police - I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to look at a Russian the same way ever again despite knowing that this isn\u2019t their doing. Maybe it\u2019s raw emotions, but no matter what they do to Ukraine, make it neutral or a puppet state or whatever, I can no longer look at the world the same way.",

It really feels like he doesn\u2019t care if he leaves Russia in shambles, his personal story will read that he cracked down on the oligarchs after the fall of the Soviet Union (or at least got things more organized), became basically a new Tsar and now, if he succeeds in installing a puppet government in Ukraine, he\u2019ll have \u201creunified\u201d the \u201ctrue Russian Empire\u201d.\n\nWhat we are seeing are delusions detached from reality in the mind of an old man obsessed with his own legend and who thinks he\u2019s the main character in his country\u2019s story. And millions will suffer as a result.\n\nEDIT: after talking with others around other threads, there likely is another answer as to why he\u2019s doing this - test run for China to invade Taiwan so both countries can have an essential monopoly over semiconductors (they have preexisting tech sharing agreements in place), which would make it nearly impossible for the US and Europe to keep up techwise. \n\nAn alliance of devils hellbent on ruling the world and getting revenge on countries they hate.

Russian gas flows into Europe are slated to be lower this winter, with the country's Gazprom gas giant opting not to buy additional capacity on the Ukrainian transit system in anticipation of regulatory approval of commercial flow on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany. \n\n&gt;\"This blackmail from the Russian side, this would not have been possible if we would have developed Black Sea reserves,\" he said. \n\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/102121-turkish-gas-finds-could-stimulate-black-sea-exploration-and-production-panel",

Naturally Russia wasn't under invasion threat from Ukraine.  And colonizing Ukraine doesn't push Russia farther away from NATO countries - it brings it closer.  \n\nPure speculation, but Putin might not care whether this is a successful invasion.  He's showing willingness to fight, likely stoking his support base, and causing havoc far away from Moscow.",

We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.\n\nPolish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl\n\nPlease share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.\n\nEDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!\n\nEDIT2: as a proof that you no longer need visa:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060in Ukrainian https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina---ua\n\u2022\t\u2060in English https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina-en",

So there's not enough space or resources to arrest and hold 3-4% of the population. What are you going to do, just shoot them? Say hello to +10% more resistance then.\n\nAnd Russia, like most countries, has less than 0.5% of its population as police (and military is bad at policing and otherwise occupied at the moment), so if 4% of the population is protesting, they're outnumbered 10:1.\n\nIt takes less than you think... and not all of those people even need to be out and about, that would includes strikes etc. too.\n\nPart of the reason sanctions can work too is by motivating people in an area to push those protesting numbers up into that unstoppable wave territory.",

They know this can turn nasty. It is one of few ways to get to Putin. An army fighting a war in Ukraine while watching their homeland enter an uprising.\n\nI think it will take surprisingly little. Maybe an officer accidentally killing a protestor. Maybe a protestor knifing an officer. Some factor that escalates this to actual violence.\n\nSo far they are peaceful, but this is a people that is about to get desperate as they learn the Russia of today is not the Russia of yesterday. So far it is mostly \"just\" reactionary to the war itself, but it's going to turn into something so much more than that.\n\nThe world is in such a weird state right now. I can't see how Ukraine will get out of this without military support. But I also can't see how Putin will get away with this.",

No where in the bible doe sit say the antichrist will be successful on the first try, the antichrists will appear throughout history to attempt to take over, the point is if the world is sinful enough, it will let him take over, the question is if the world is sinful enough right now.\n\nhttps://www.harvestbiblechapel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/10-Characteristics-of-the-AntiChrist.pdf",

My family is mostly \"christian\", but my grandmother is the near embodiment of the Good Book itself. But she has even quoted the bible verse (unsure the exact quote or verse, but basically...) about how evil people will pretend to pray or use prayer as a tool instead of just for the act itself.\n\n She used this to highlight, not Trump, but Biden. Not the guy who smoke bombed a church for a photo op..... the guy with a fraudulent laptop that we havnt heard about, found, or seen since the dipshit screamed about it after an investigation or 2. \n\nIts mindboggling how VERY EASILY anyone can see Trumps being a criminal, illegal dealings, and embodiment of multiple 7 Deadly Sins (and i do mean at the core of his being, not the \"no ones perfect, everyone makes mistakes\" sort of way). All they have to do is watch anything but Faux News. But they still hold him on high. And its crazy to me.",

This show of force is a response to that.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran knows that Trump can't tweet at them right now and they're essentially mocking him by trying to bait a tweet storm he can't give.\n\nPersonally, I think the Ayatollah should be banned along side Trump if we're now banning world leaders who incite violence.",

In my travels most of the ex-pats i've hung out with in various countries are ex military or business folks who had to travel internationally for work and pretty quickly realized that screams of \"America is the greatest\" or \"America is the last free nation on the planet!\" is utter lies and decided to move.\n\nDon't get me wrong, America is a great place for the most part, especially if you don't get sucked into the 24hr news cycle, but when you travel you realize it's full of insanely selfish people who think suffering is some right of passage people should be forced to go through.\n\nI'm quickly reminded of it based on how helpful most folks are to foreigners in other places.  Asked for help in Shenzhen had quite a few folks excited to practice their English and assist me.  Got lost on the NYC subway and got ignored, and in one instance, told to flat out fuck off for the audacity to ask a stranger for assistance.",

Because the British and Americans had oil interests there and the prime minister (and the parliament) was trying to nationalise the oil.\n\nBasically, the US, who had fought so hard to defeat fascism and bring democracy to Europe in the early 40's, turned around and completely demolished a democracy in the 50's in order to control oil.\n\nTruman himself had been opposed to any attempts at coups previously, especially ones involving the CIA out of fear of what precedent it would set.hewas absolutely correct, as the CIA has been involved in numerous coups and attacks on democracies that go against the US grain. \n\nThe US and UK are responsible for the theocracy that is modern day Iran. \n\nWithout their involvement, it is entirely possible that Iran would be a relatively progressive and secular country. Certainly more progressive than it currently is and almost definitely more than their neighbors.",

That's the largest single-year decline in life expectancy in at least 40 years, and it would bring the country's life expectancy down its lowest level since 2003, the researchers said.",

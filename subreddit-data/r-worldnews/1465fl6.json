I used to bus, train and walk everywhere, I straight up didn't consider 1.5 h of walking to a destination a big deal. Use a car in moderation. Get a bloody bicycle. Hell, get some roller skates.

The majority of road damage is caused by heavy vehicles such as busses and big trucks. If heavy vehicles are causing the most wear and tear then adding a few hundred kilos to smaller vehicles is a drop in the rain.\n\nI keep seeing this argument cropping up and it isn't well sourced and doesn't make sense. I'm not saying EVs won't cause more wear and tear, but the amount of extra wear and tear they will cause compared to heavy vehicles seems to me to be obviously marginal.",

It seems the intent of this variable parking pricing is not about accounting for road damage but instead for valuable city space being taken up by parked vehicles. In this case, Montreal\u2019s proposed pricing scheme by car length makes the most sense.",

Most of them just search another spot but few park there anyway and then some small truck can't pass them and it create a mess. Same for linear spots, when you put a suv on it, you lost one spot every 3 ones.\n\nI only take my car twice a month to carry big packaging like drinks and it take me sometime 45 min to find a parking spot.

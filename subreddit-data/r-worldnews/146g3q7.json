That was of course a fight against a genocidal authorotarian Nazi regime and whilst war is terrible the basis for Britain declaring war on Germany in 1939 was moral IMHO. What Russia has and is doing can't be tolerated, they keep upping the ante and escalating when they need to be getting out. The West simply can't let Russia win or draw, but Russia won't leave - a dangerous impasse but that's not an excuse to allow Russia to succeed in their goals. The future will be more dangerous and unpredictable with an emboldened Russia that is lawless and unchecked.",

And I'm not sure every side actually necessarily believes in their side being justified in a war - the Russian soldiers on training exercises finding themselves in Ukraine and being fired upon certainly weren't in a position to justify anything. I fully expect Putin can justify himself in his own mind, but that doesn't mean those around him can do too, esp if they have access to other info and value their and their families' lives.  \nI do think that outside Russia we have access to the bigger picture, it's not hard to agree on who is right and who the aggressor is and we agree.",

Sure, targeting dams in wartime is nothing new, including in the current Ukraine war before the recent dam destruction, but the Russian's actions is a new low and further evidence of their disregard for law and humanity. The British comparison is IMHO wrong - sure the WW2 Allies had actions to answer for (and by and large have), and not just that Geneva came later, but Britain and others were literally fighting for freedom from a regime that had a network of gas chambers. And Britain never commited the atrocities and genocide that Russia does daily.",

I specifically mention a modern war, and you bring up WW2.\n\n I know dudes who's whole job for about two whole years during the occupation was smashing in doors and taking people from their homes. Often people would die or be extremely injured during these 'raids'. And more often then that, it would be bad intel or false rumors and the poor idiot that got bagged and tagged got fucked up for literally no reason. This went on for over a decade.\n\nOne really nice story from someone I know that served in the Army, they went into some dude's house they thought was an observer for IEDs. Someone who watches and calls when the US gets close. They saw him sitting up on this really good spot where he could see this entire valley where IED were going off, and they had good intel that he sat there like every other day and just watched the valley. Right out in the open. So they went in and took this guy from his family, he had grown children and he lived with one of them and their family. They never asked the family anything though. \n\nThey took his ass and roughed up, he was obviously terrified, but these guys thought that he was responsible for giving up their friends to be blown up. So they beat the fucking shit out of the guy. Well, he wasn't doing too well. He was an old man. Prolly in his 60's. \n\nHe slipped into a coma, so they took him out to secluded spot and shot him and buried him. Never got anything out of him. His family came looking for him, and we said we released him. They said he never came home. They also said that the reason he was always sitting up there is because that's where he used to sit with his brothers and watch the sun set and rise over the valley. All of his brothers were dead.\n\nThis sort of shit was happening all the time. Especially in the first few years of the occupation. I've heard stories that hurt my very fucking soul. And none of these things are common knowledge, and I only have good knowledge of ONE FUCKING UNIT. \n\nTo say that the US did a lot of war crimes is probably an understatement. What can't be overstated however, is how much worse Russia is.",

The city center and public transport are covered in Zs and ads. I don't think they'd do that, if they had a whole lot of support and volunteers.\n\n&gt; they deserve worse  \n\nYou know, it would be cool if more of the sanctions were targeting the Russian government, instead of straight up fucking assisting it.  \n\nFor example, I'd get the hell out this Tartarus... if the counties where I have any friends or family would actually let me in. But they don't. Because sanctions. They don't issue visas anymore.  \n\nIt's my fault, I guess, that Russia decided to invade Ukraine back when I was still going to school.

Given that the 'I don't care' opinion is arguably just as bad as the nationalistic opinion, I would say that yes, the Russian population does support the country's current actions in Ukraine.\n\nOn your second point, I would like to point out to you that there are not currently 300,000 or however many Russian 'government officials' invading Ukraine. They are ordinary Russians, just like you. They are the ones killing, they are the ones torturing and they are the ones raping. \n\nNow you'll probably have something to say like 'They are just normal people who will be killed if they didn't obey commands'. To which I will reply, killed by who? Oh, that's right. Ordinary Russians again. Not government officials (in most cases). You may not personally be a bad Russian, but enough bad Russians do exist that the sanctions are more than deserved.",

They're members of the Russian army. They're being paid by the gov't, so technically they're gov't employees.  \n\nThe ones who volunteered for that, though- I have zero respect or pity for those people. Even less for those committing atrocities and war crimes.  \n\nRegular conscripts, those who never wanted to be a part of it, on the other hand... I hate the fact that I might end up being one of those.  \n\nAs for sanction and emigration: I know it can be difficult to execute, but just do a background check? Restrict emigration for Russians who are known members of the Russian military, government or oligarchy. Not just everyone with a Russian passport. Maybe even deport people spreading pro-Russian propaganda and defending its views, if you must.  \n\nCurrent sanctions don't actually affect anyone on top. There's plenty of countries more than willing to give out citizenships to anyone willing to \"invest\" a couple hundred thousand dollars in them.

But, in my view, half the point of sanctions is to push ordinary Russians into action. As much as I've seen it spread by propagandists, NATO isn't going to march in and regime change Russia. But as you can hopefully understand, a lot of countries aren't happy with the current regime. The only way to get that change is by prodding ordinary Russians into realising that they no longer have to be run by the mafia state. \n\nEasier said than done, I know. But I hope one day we will have a prosperous Russia who is friends with the West. \n\nI also hope you don't end up getting conscripted, but just remember, ordinary people like you are capable of stopping all of this.

But changing the lists, and comparing the counts, by process of elimination you can get an estimate of the support for one specific question without anyone specifically answering it.

They just beat and arrest people until they disperse. And I absolutely wouldn't be surprised if we ended up with \"Tiananmen Square, Russian Edition\" one day.  \n\nWhat are the other options?

[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The farmer thinks for a moment, then says to the genie, \"I would like the Mongols to invade my village.\"\n\n\"Your wish is my command,\" says the genie. A few months later, the Mongols burn down the farmer's village. The farmer emerges from the wreckage, and life slowly returns to normal... until he speaks to the genie again.\n\n\"I want the Mongols to attack my village.\"\n\n\"Again? Well... your wish is my command.\" \n\nSure it was a dumb wish, but the genie was used to those, and at least it wasn't a weird sex thing. So the Golden Horde comes back and wipes the farmer's village from the face of the Earth. And again, the farmer comes out of hiding and summons the genie.\n\n\"I want the Mongols to attack my village.\"\n\nAt this point the genie is confused and a little disturbed.\n\n\"You've rebuilt your home twice now, why do you keep asking me to destroy your village?\"\n\n\"Every time the Mongols come to burn down my village, they have to march through Russia twice.\"",

A lot of nations forgot their roots.\n\nSame case can be mentioned about a lot of modern nations/countries fighting hating each other for no reason when they are from the same people/tribes.

There is talk of some Russian fanatics looking to take back Alaska saying it was a 99 yr lease not a sale. The Smithsonian has a copy of the sale and the cancelled check.",

[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

At least, the United States already funds a pretty large number of researchers, including in basic sciences. There's probably some room to reasonably expand research head count, but especially with basic sciences, you're often not getting easily quantifiable/justifiable economic benefits (with applied sciences, the benefits are more readily apparent).\n\nThe United States and I believe Canada and Australia have generally been pretty aggressive about poaching talent globally. I can't speak to Europe. But there's limits to how much your economy/research sector needs.",

The same autocrat that completely ruined their power division, who created a cult of personality not seen since Mao, who thoroughly corrupted the system for his personal gain, the same who had to bow down to public pressure (first one since the revolution?), the same who blew the mask of the \"nice wise man from China\" at least about 20-30 years too early (imagine if Xi hadnt shat the bed, and China would have continued to quietly buy up and transfer tech while building up its military and spreading their influence via investments all over the West for another two or three decades. Theyd be utterly unstoppable), for no better reason than his megalomania not allowing him to take a second row place in modern chinese history like Deng Xiaoping? That guy? He is Chinas Putin, and this is his \"first half\", like Putins from 2000-2012. And just like Putin back then he is seen as good leader by some, especially people who worship authies.

But yeah, the focus should obviously be on improving the situation in Japan to make people WANT to stay rather than forcing them like that.",

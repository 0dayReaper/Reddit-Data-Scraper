All you have to do is do look at the hundreds of different materials employed by speaker manufacturers for cone materials alone.  Each has its own signature and is very noticeable.\n\nSaying you can 3d print a replica of a 12kya flute with modern materials and expect it to sound **the same** as the original natural materials is absurd.\n\nI am not arguing against similar.",

I've played various flutes (bansuri, ney, shinobue) made from various materials (bamboo, wood, reed cane, plastic, pvc pipe) - in other words I've played all those instruments in all those materials. In each case, a bansuri sounds like a bansuri and a ney like a ney irrespective of what material it's made from. Yes they all sound *slightly different*, but that difference diminishes the more accomplished the player. For example, professional Turkish ney players often prefer plastic over reed cane because it's more reliable and sounds good enough to them. It's *similar enough* to serve as a replacement in a professional context.\n\nA copy of this flute using modern materials would sound *similar enough* for scientists to recreate what the flute sounded like, minus qualities such as harmonics which are less noticeable in such a small instrument.",

You can very easily tell from spacial imaging if there\u2019s other non-natural cavities or materials present. From what we do know from recorded history of ancient flute like instruments is that they very much did \u201cjust hollow out\u201d different things. They didn\u2019t do anything special other than hollow stuff out and put holes in appropriate places/appropriate lengths to make the desired sounds. If this flute is somehow special from other ancient instruments, who knows, but we could tell with some analysis.\n\nI don\u2019t really care what anyone says about \u201cslight difference\u201d when it comes to recording in a sound proof recording studio using endless amounts of optimization, sound calibration, and tuning. I\u2019m talking about it sounding close enough that no one could tell the difference between in and a series of similar flutes from the time. You think that these flutes were somehow all perfectly calibrated and tuned in sync together with each other? Do you think birds vocal cords are? There\u2019s always some kind of natural variance and we could definitely recreate something within that variation range.\n\nEven modern instruments right next to each other on the assembly line wont sound the **exact** same as each other but will sound similar enough that they can be calibrated easily to be within an allowed tolerance of each other. That level of control didn\u2019t exist until very recently in history. Even classical music didn\u2019t have that level of control which is why instrument heritage and branding mattered so much more back then to replicate the most similar sound.",

I wonder if they used this technique for hunting or if it had some sort of spiritual significance. It's fascinating to see how humans have been exploring and experimenting with music for thousands of years. Thanks for sharing this interesting piece of history!",

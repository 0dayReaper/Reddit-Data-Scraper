He has expressed admiration for his grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, who was imprisoned after World War II on the charges of being a Class A war criminal. His scumbag grandfather was the economic manager for Japanese occupied China. His policies resulted in tens of millions Chinese being worked to death as slaves. A TYPICAL example is the Fushun coal mine. That mine had 40,000 Chinese slaves and need over 1,000 new slaves a week because 1,000 slaves died.\n2. Abe was a special advisor to the group Nippon Kaigi (Japan Conference), which claims Imperial Japan should be lauded for liberating Asia from Western colonial powers, the Tokyo war crimes tribunals were illegitimate, and war crimes such as the Rape of Nanking in 1937 were exaggerated or fabricated. He was quite vocal that the Rape of Nanking NEVER happened.",

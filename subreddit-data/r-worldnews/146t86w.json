He was already fined by the police for breaking the law, this is a Parliamentary Enquiry into whether he mislead (lied to) Parliament and broke the Ministerial Code. \n\nHe likely resigned because the enquiry recommends that he be suspended for over 10 days, which means his constituency can trigger a by election and force him out of office. It was already looking likely that he would lose the next election, so this is him jumping to save the embarrassment of being kicked out. Boris Johnson will know what is in the report already, as the standard practice is to provide the investigated with a copy before publication so they have time to form a response.",

Supposedly, he had enough votes for the competition for leader after Truss was ousted. It would have meant it would be between him and Sunak, but he pulled out anyways. He either didn't have the support he said he had, or he was not confident he could win the race confidently. \n\nHe has made a boatload on the speech circuit and writing memoirs as a former PM. After he was ousted from the PM office, he went on a tour while he is still technically a MP, so he was not representing his constituency during that time.\n\nHe also has recently purchased a home in a constituency that is safer than his current one, which does have a non-zero chance of flipping in a by-election or in the next one, which would leave him with the same power as Farage, a politician with no political power and a public that is turning against him as Sunak cements his stability in the party (at least until the predicted pounding in the next election).",

This was a result of a long investigation expected to come out next week publicly on rule breaking during their Covid lockdown that would recommend a suspension of Johnson. Both Johnson and Sunak (current PM and Tory leader) have been forwarded a copy of the findings in advance, which prompted this reaction from Johnson. If an MP is suspended over a certain amount of time, members of that constituency can force a by-election as they are not being represented in parliament. Johnson's seat is also contested seat, and with the unpopularity of the Tories and Johnson personally to many people, he might lose. So rather than be dealt a humiliating defeat, he resigns right now and accuses the current PM and Tory party of trying to oust him. This saves him from losing an election, lets him possibly run in the next election in a different place that is a safer seat.\n\nHis resignation has also started a rebellion by Johnson loyalists who are also resigning and forcing by-elections. hoping to damage Sunak enough to come to the negotiating table with Johnson's supporters, or at least weaken Sunak enough to challenge him after the next general election when the Tories are expected to be dealt a huge defeat in the polls.",

His attempted rebellion on the Windsor Framework was patheticly ill supported. He's got no pull, outside of media barons. Arguably Johnson wasn't even that popular in the UK in 2019, he barely improve May's vote share, but won by narrowly winning a lot of constituencies with a one off deal to people in the North of England who were put off by Corbyn.\n\nTrump... Trump holds popular support with a greater chunk of the US population, and in the Republican Party, afaik. And he could feasibly return to power, unlike Johnson who has sort of burned his support in the only party that could put him at the top.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; LONDON, June 11 - The world has moved on from former British prime minister Boris Johnson and the governing Conservative Party and the rest of the country do not miss the drama of his period in office, energy minister Grant Shapps said on Sunday.\n\n&gt; Johnson quit parliament late on Friday in protest against an investigation by lawmakers into his conduct as prime minister during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdown- breaking parties were held in Downing Street.\n\n&gt; Asked about criticism from Johnson and his allies that he was forced out, Shapps told Sky News: &amp;quot;The world has moved on. He is the one who&amp;#039;s removed himself from the current political scene, standing down as a member of parliament.\"\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/146td14/uk_minister_the_world_has_moved_on_from_boris/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688513 tl;drs so far.\") | [Service Blackout](https://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/146cacj/joining_the_blackout_a_message_from_uautotldr/ \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Johnson**^#1 **minister**^#2 **Party**^#3 **parliament**^#4 **prime**^#5",

As a regular Reddit user, I've seen many opinions on the controversial UK minister. Some view him as a competent leader, while others criticize his policies and behavior. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide if they think Boris Johnson is keeping up with the times or falling behind.",

There will always be someone else waiting to take his place. Who knows, maybe he'll make a comeback someday. Until then, let's keep our eyes and ears open.",

He has very little support from his own party (that he purged and made as supportive as he could for 2019, so as pro-Johnson a Tory parliamentary party as you could likely get), he's unpopular with most of the public (I think it was 62% of the public supports him resigning, 70% think he committed more crimes during COVID), his attempted rebellion over the Windsor Framework had basically no support. All he has is friendly media barons who make it sound like he has more support than he does, both in the public and party. He's not coming back. Arguably, he only became leader due to a deal with the devil to try and not lose the next election following the May chaos. I don't see how he could functionally return.",

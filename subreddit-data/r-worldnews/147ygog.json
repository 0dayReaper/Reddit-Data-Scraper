[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The Supreme court recently ruled that all criteria is met and there is no reason to refuse the request. And now the government has given their final stamp of approval. Teeechnically they could still hold off on turning him over, but like I wrote, that would have been problematic, as politicians do not want to be seen meddling with what is supposed to be a judicial matter. This applies to the other Nordic countries as well.\n\nAs far as Swedish domestic politics go, the left wing (currently in opposition) has strong sympathies and links with Kurdish activists, while the right wing (currently in government) does not. No one is a fan Erdogan or AKP, though.",

He was released on parole and moved to Sweden but was arrested in August last year following a request from Turkish prosecutors.\n\nhttps://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/06/12/sweden-to-extradite-self-proclaimed-pkk-supporter-to-turkey_6030986_4.html\n\nAnd just for clarity's sake: in Sweden, the Supreme Court is an independent judicial body which does not take orders from politicians.",

I fully support the rights of Kurds in Turkey (I want the Kurdish language to be officially recognized and thought in schools as an elective, I want villages and cities to have their Kurdish names on their signs if they want, I want racism against Kurds to be harshly punished, I want the government to use funds to help Kurdish areas.) \n\nWith that being said anyone who flies a PKK flag is a Terrorist supporter in my eyes. To me a PKK flag is as bad as running an ISIS or Taliban flag. That to me is the core issue with Sweden\u2019s predicament. PKK is recognized as a Terrorist entity by NATO. How do you think the average Turk feels when they see these events in a country that wants to be our allies? All Sweden is doing is buttering Erdogans toast by allowing this and not extraditing terrorists. He comes out on TV and just goes Eyyyyyyy Sweden, rambles on and the average people just eat it up. You want to stop all this BS then stop enabling terrorists. This includes Turkey as well. We all know damn they bought ISIS oil and allowed ISIS to transport their wounded. We should damn well admit to it and pay the price, Sweden should do their part to stop PKK then should be allowed in. If Kurds want to protest then by all means do it, shit I\u2019ll even join if they don\u2019t run PKK flags but I won\u2019t hold my breath.",

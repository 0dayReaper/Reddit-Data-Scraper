And what's more, St. Paul refers to it in his letters to the Roman's, and Corinthians. See, he was a pharasee, a learned man who had rabidical training. He walked the earth talking not just of Jesus, but pointing out to the jews that the old Testament speaks of this. His whole set of apistles speaks of the coming, life, and death and resurrection of Christ.\n\nAlso, many points of the old testament are taken out of context. Unfortunately, this is perpetuated and taken for solid truth of evil intent in the Bible, mostly pushed forward by people with no knowledge of the words they butcher.",

Canaan was sacrificing children, burning them on altars and so the Israelites were given the task of being a judgement on them. Skip forward not very far along - Persia, Babylon, Assyria, Greece and Rome did the very same thing to Israel/Judah because they ended up doing worse than the Canaanites. So it's not one sided.\nThat being said, the Russians should be allowed to be pacifists if they don't believe in being an invading force. The bible says to obey authorities up until it conflicts with God's teaching. You can't quote the OT and say \"therefore - we can attack anyone we like\"... that's isogesis and dishonest interpretation.",

Jesus is also the guy who chased the moneylenders from the Temple.   \n\nThe moral problem is that strict pacifism eliminates self-defense or defense of others. Non-violence is strongly preferred, of course.  Murder is forbidden. But you're not required to stand by while someone is murdering your children, and sometimes you may have a moral obligation to use violence if other options don't remain.\n\nThis has been extended to governments, who have the right and responsibility to protect their people from external harms.\n\nI have no idea or comment about this scenario in Russia, I'm just explaining doctrine common to most Christians.",

Although the emphasis on pacifism as an anti-war doctrine is the focus of this article, the other nuances of the theory need to be noted.\nhttps://iep.utm.edu/pacifism/\n\n\nAnd never fighting in war has the same moral problems - it's usually immoral (and stupid) to just stand by while, say, the Nazi tanks are rolling in.  Legitimate war fighting comes from the right of self defense.  Or to use a more recent example, were the Ukrainians required just to passively let the Russians invade?",

It was viewed as similar to, but inferior to life on Earth, quite grim, with the dead being reliant on food and drink offerings from their kin for sustinence, or else they'd become beggars. In the afterlife, you basically did the same thing you did in life, except things were worse. That goes for everybody; nobody had it better in the afterlife.",

Socialism is a particular type of communal ownership. And should not be imposed retroactively. 2) Jesus didn't advocate for any sort of communal ownership. Early Christians are said to have practiced a type of communal ownership, but that is found in Acts, not in Jesus' own teachings. \n\n&gt;Paul was Mr render unto Caesar what is Caesars.\n\nNo, that's literally Jesus. \n\nMatthew 22: 17-21 \"Tell us, then, what you think.

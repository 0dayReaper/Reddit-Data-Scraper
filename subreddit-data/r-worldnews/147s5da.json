[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I dont know how many drones the two had yesterday but now it seems they can get the data the us drones get.  that i think is a big deal and will piss off china.",

That's the extent of Japan's involvement in the Korean War other than creating the base unstability.\n\nBoth Taiwan and Korea were colonies of Japan during similar time periods 1895-1945 or in Korea's case 1910-1945\n\nThe difference is that Taiwan has been less publicaly bitter about the colonization for political reasons and has been for a long time. South Korean politicians tends to use Japan's WWII past as well as Japan's attempts to whitewash whenever their popularity declines. Japanese politicians use South Korean responses to cater to hyper Nationalist Japanese which all leads to a cycle of Japan and Korea hating each other periodically.\n\nJapan for better or for worse wants to put WWII in the past and move forward. Taiwan has more or less let Japan do that.\nSouth Korea wants to relitigate WWII because they aren't happy with what was decided in the past governments.",

I mean, just seeing the kind of atrocities carried out under Operation Gladio - and the ignorance of almost everyone in NATO nation states about it should be eye opening.\n\nI do not think that nuance on this issues is expressed by cheering on sides as aggression amps up in chip/territorial waters struggle. Defense agreements like this may be inevitable, but its hard not to just feel dismay that we find ourselves in these kinds of situations.",

This would have been a good idea back in the 'effing 90s, when NAFTA was supposed to have paved the way for a regional common market with open borders and free trade.  But instead - because we exported all the Bush/Obama-era capital across the Pacific - it seems more like Malyasia and Indonesia and the Phillipines are trying to fill China's role.  And that becomes difficult for the US, because these countries are still squarely in China's geographic region of influence.\n\nBack in the states, you've got Governor Greg Abbott practically advocating open war on Mexico because of his state's own demand for migrant labor and recreational narcotics.

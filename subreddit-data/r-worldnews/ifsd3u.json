Had she just stayed and faced it nothing would have happened to her. She wasn't under the influence or anything, she just accidentally drove on the wrong side of the road in a foreign country. She literally just had to stay and cooperate and aplogise and chances are it wouldn't have even gone to court. Maximum she might have had would be a fine and maybe her license taken away, or at most a suspended sentence (which would be extremely unlikely). Which is how it should have been, there's no point in locking someone up over an accident, if you believe she's still a danger then remove her license.\n\nBut instead she did the most cowardly and pathetic thing possible and ran away, and tried to hide behind her diplomatic immunity. Now she absolutely will not be treated lightly by the courts, and she shouldn't be, causing an accident is one thing, but then running away to hide in your home country is just disgustingly cowardly.\n\nHonestly I really can't even understand why she did it. It was literally the only choice she could have made which would have made the situation worse for everyone.",

She had to have known about this stuff long before it became public, and as far as I can see she must have assumed it'd just stay a dirty little family secret swept under the rug. Even if she took no active part in the coverup she surely could have been part of the *un*coverup.\n\nVery sad if her legacy ends with this as the final footnote. [She served as a truck mechanic in World War II](https://mashable.com/2015/04/22/queen-elizabeth-army/#52W3D0qAnsqO). That's a queen that should have been well remembered.",

Harder drugs were easily available at parties. From what I heard the police would tolerate using, but dealing would be a big nono. If you were caught with a little just pay a bit to the officers and you were good. Funny thing was the happy pizza places often wouldn't sell their extra happy pizzas before the sun set.",

You point them out to us and we let you go about your business.\u201d\n\nThen some idiot tourist finds out he can score weed from some dude on Facebook and the dealer tips off the cops who are waiting for the guy the second he steps out of the drug buy and they shake his ass down for $1,000 - $2,000 USD.  \n\nLike a broken slot machine, it just keeps paying off.  \n\nAnd, the drug dealer doesn\u2019t need to rat out his regular expat customers.

I traveled through southern Thailand for a month in 2012, and I never had issues finding weed. As long as you were sensible about it, and didn't just light up anywhere, there wasn't any issues. I think the south was a bit more progressive in that way, and they knew what the tourists wanted. I found weed within 1 day of being there, and our hostel owner let us smoke in our room (he was a super chill French guy)",

It's such a comical no-brainer to allow it that I can't believe it's still illegal anywhere, let alone countries that are far more progressive than the US like Australia or the UK.",

Alcohol is an addictive substance meaning people will buy it regularly out of necessity and it was then far easier to profit from. The official complete ban with the CSA in 1970 was to counter dwindling American faith in the government during the 1960s as marijuana was still finding its way legally around people who happened to oppose the way the government was operating. Guilt by association, I suppose. \n\nEither way it all comes back to government controlled alcohol sales, and only with thanks to better technology and medicinal research is the tide slowly starting to turn the other way. But only when the government is able to get its hooks completely in the industry is when decriminalization will occur.",

Greatest thing about legalization is how many of my neighbors are openly growing and consuming as well, just enjoying our lives free from government overreach. I was recently out walking the dog with my partner and we got talking to a little old lady about her tomatoes, peppers, herbs and her husband's 'special plants for his arthritis, that he used to have to grow in secret', told her about our special plants, and she invited us to stop by for tea. I have given joints, buds, and brownies to several of my neighbors and our friends as gifts (they make excellent Christmas gifts, like homemade jam/sauces), and we have bonded over this plant without having to worry about the police, it's viewed now just like homebrew - don't go peddling it to kids and you won't have a problem. I have pounds and pounds of product in various forms around my house - I am set for life on supply and am growing as a fun hobby. Merely 10 years ago but especially 20+ years ago that would have put me at risk of being violently robbed, fined, or imprisonment plus a criminal record and reduced employment prospects.",

So they are are essentially still banning extracted oils / concentrates / distillates as narcotics, but also setting a limit for edibles of 2mg/gram. If you made 1 gram gummy candies with an extract in them you could put up to 3 milligrams of some 66.5% oil in them, or 4mg of 50%, etc. 2mg of compounds total\n\nHowever, \"flower\" now basically just  counts as a public nuisance charge if you do it around someone who is offended by the smell enough to call police on you.\n\nSo stick to the weed bars and avoid dab.\n\nAlso there's about to be an edibles market boom there. People are going to make a lot of money, but you don't want to hold onto the oil for long before its processed into edibles. It's a grey market game where they are probably not going to issue licenses to do primary processing of the plant into oil, but selling products that have gone through secondary processing with 1/500th compounds in them is fine. The risk of not allowing primary processing officially just raises the cost, looking forward to see how they approach that",

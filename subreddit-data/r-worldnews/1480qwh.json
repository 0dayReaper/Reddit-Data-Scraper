It's mostly to show leadership and display the ability to find and ensure the completion of a project that provides a service to someone\n\nFor my project we built these big ol' sliding gates for the city community gardens. The amount of planning that went into it was way more than I anticipated, and there were a ton of problems we had to overcome. It took longer than any of us thought it would but the experiences I had leading, organizing, and finishing the project were pretty substantial for how old I was (i was either 13 or 14, I can't remember exactly)\n\nObviously not all projects are of the same scale. Some projects are massive undertakings that span long periods of time (personally I think that's a little overkill) and some are probably not quite enough\n\nThere is a large amount of paperwork that goes into the project, which you submit at the end of it all (I wish I could remember how many pages mine ended up being) and that's really what you need. You submit this to a council of dudes (again this is all a little fuzzy and I'm sure lots has changed) and they sort of look at what you did and decide if it was enough, though they also have to approve it beforehand\n\nIf I'm being honest I think that it's not nearly as serious as it used to be. Even when I got my eagle badge, my eagle scout interview was pretty relaxed. My dad talked about his and how he was practically sweating buckets during his but I can't remember being nervous at all during mine. I can imagine it's only gotten more lax as more and more issues come about with the scouting program\n\nTL;DR: Eagle projects are generally meant to show leadership and organization but the project itself isn't all there is to do. That being said it should probably be more than planting some brushes, but who am I to judge lol",

I got into more than one heated argument with adult leadership about how I did not want to be forced to participate in their worship services, and how it was impossible in their eyes for a scout to live up to \u201cA Scout is Reverent\u201d without believing in some form of higher power. \n\nWhen you\u2019re going through a progress review board for advancement to the next rank, and you\u2019re outnumbered three-to-one by adults who think that it\u2019s a great opportunity to proselytize to you, it puts a real damper on your enthusiasm to make Eagle. By the time I left at sixteen, I had long since met all the requirements for Life, but I just couldn\u2019t go through that again, so I stayed at Star.\n\nI can only imagine how it would have been if I\u2019d *also* been openly queer at that time. It wasn\u2019t until shortly before I left that they lifted the ban on gay adult leaders, after all. That\u2019s not a welcoming stance from the organization\u2019s leadership.\n\nAlso, now that I think back to it, did anyone else get a really *weird* vibe from the Order of the Arrow? Not just the frankly embarrassing appropriation of Native American culture, but even back then it felt weirdly cult-like.\n\nE: also also, the not-so-subtle military undertones did not help matters.\n\nE2: should clarify that I\u2019m talking about the BSA, not UK Scouts.",

I run cubscout pack camping trips with kids of all ages and can keep them from doing that.  We are vigilant, we make huge announcements about camping rules (I am pretty sure I have a pdf or word doc of the full list somewhere if you want it), we make parents and scout read and sign the rules every year and make it known thay breaking them means immediate leaving of camping and potentially no longer allowed to attend camping. I am very known amongst all of my scout groups as the rules enforcer, I play and do silly stuff and have a great time but I don't fuck around with safety rules.",

That is true in schools and youth sports teams too, but overnight camping does introduce potential problems not found in those other settings.\n\nStrict enforcement of that two deep leadership and an independent reporting channel for potential abuse is a good start.",

But I do think scouting HAS been making a lot of good reforms to stop child abuse in the future.\n\nFor example, I've been volunteering once a month at a boy scout camp with some old friends to do construction work. We go in the off season as volunteers and don't interact with the scouts. New rules were just put in place that mean we have to get regular background checks and take child protection training if we want to even work on camp property. \n\nTraining and background checks are not perfect but I think the problem is less that scouting turns a blind eye to abusers and more that abusers are always attracted to activities like scouting that put them in close proximity to kids. \n\n(Also, I don't think the scouts have ANY problem pushing for convictions of sex offenders)",

The Mormons basically used the program as youth ministry and were able to dictate a lot of BSA policy just because of the disproportionate number the scouters ($$$) that were Mormon.  When the [BSA started allowing gay members](https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-boy-scouts-evolution-2017-story.html), the Mormons at National threw a bitch fit and pulled out of the program.\n\nWith the Mormon's influence now gone, there's been a massive change in the BSA including fully cooperating with Law Enforcement regarding child abuse/assault investigations and allowing girls to join regular troops rather than be forced into Explorers.",

Scout safeguarding policy is quite clear and detailed, and the training was good. Leaders in my group absolutely made sure that it was followed. Rule one was 'never be alone with a scout'. Follow that and you can't go too far wrong.\n\nThat's clearly not happening everywhere through. Having a paid, professional safeguarding lead in each county, as the article suggests, would definitely help ensure that policies were being correctly followed.\n\nI'm also not surprised that most of the abuse was from some time ago, and quite a bit was in Venture Scouts. Having a group of 15-20 year-olds together, often with leaders who were barely older, was always going to cause issues. Made sense to change the age groups.",

If the training is followed, there should never be a situation where a scout is alone with an adult, it is always \"two deep\" leadership.\n\nDue to the settlements, the BSA had to sell the local \"Cub World\" camp where I spent a lot of my weekends and summers camping in Cub Scouts. We now have to drive over an hour further to the Boy Scout camp. It stings a little to see a place I fondly remember get bulldozed because was sold and is now \"prime real estate\".",

I feel horrible for the many victims who have been affected by past leadership. As someone else has noted a huge portion of those victims where from charters (a charter is a place or group that allows the troop to use their facilities for meetings) Mormon church or other religious institutions. That all said since all that has gone down it is now a requirement that all volunteers who in interact with the kids be background checked and take online courses on youth protection against abuse as well as it being a requirement that every child takes online lessons as well each year. The kids one is different for each age group and catered to their understanding level and uses age appropriate messaging. Also I would like to add that while the organization still has some religious ties though it now tries to cater to any cultural religion not just Christianity and those lessons are for the individual family to pursue not for the den. We use Unitarian Universalism for my family. I have not had any issue with my sexuality at all and I have not been the only one that\u2019s lgbtq in our troop either. I understand that can differ by place or region but they really are trying to make the organization better. My kids really enjoy all the outdoor opportunities they get and I really like the the way the lessons teach a sense of community, sportsmanship, ethical awareness and service.",

That being said, I disagree with the second half of your comment.\n\nAs a recentish (last 5 years) eagle, my time in scouting was incredibly formative. I gained so many important leadership skills and learned how to teach and train others. I use these skills on a daily basis as a tutor, organization leader, and researcher. The values that scouting instilled through the scout oath and law are some that I will carry with me through the rest of my life. \nFurthermore, in a world that has become increasingly connected, it is important for us (and especially children) to experience and gain an appreciation for the natural world. Scouting offers these opportunities, including for those who otherwise couldn\u2019t (ie. My troop had \u201cscholarships\u201d for scouts who couldn\u2019t afford to attend otherwise) I would argue that scouting has never been more relevant.\n\nNow, do I agree with everything that scouting stands for? Of course not. And I certainly believe that they can have better protections for youth members. But I\u2019ve been through many of the scouter trainings, and I know that they are actively working on improving as an organization. My parents were both very active scouters who participated in everything from woodbadge to directing camps and hosting university of scouting, and I have heard from them how much the organization changed for the better in the 20-odd years that they were scouters. \n\nUnfortunately, it seems that many people share your sentiment. I think that\u2019s deeply unfortunate. I understand why you feel the way you do, but just know that the organization today is not the organization it was 50, or even 20, years ago. It is still relevant, and plays a significant role in many people\u2019s loves. \n\nAs for money, I don\u2019t know how to feel about people suing scouts BSA and the Scouts in the UK. I understand that many people feel a need for restitution or otherwise. I cannot disagree with that. However, it pains me to see an organization that has been such an important component of my life being torn to shreds. Four of the camps that I attended as a scout have been, or are on the socket to be, sold to developers to pay the BSA\u2019s legal fees. Honestly, it sucks. I really empathize with people who are suing, but it just doesn\u2019t sit right with me.",

Your experience is truly terrible, and I hope that you are able to find counseling or some other measure so that you may be able to more comfortably interact with the children in your life. \n\nScouting organizations back nearly 60 years ago were significantly different than they are now. (At least, from my interactions with scouting in the US, NL, and Germany) These organizations were negligent and as you said even covered up allegations of sexual abuse. This was horrific, and it is every right of the victims to sue and/or seek restitution for these organizations failures. I do not disagree with any of these facts.\n\nHowever, I can still feel pain that the organization that was so integral to my development into the man I am today is suffering. These organizations have done significant work to improve their procedures to ensure that no inappropriate conduct occurs. It is a purely lose-lose situation.\n\nNow, I can definitely argue against the idea that scouting is no longer relevant. It is, and the experiences of millions of scouts today indicate that this is the case. \n\nI cannot help but feel sad many of the great opportunities that scouting currently offers - opportunities that I had and took advantage of - may not exist in 20 years due to the settlements in many of these lawsuits. I support victims in their journey for recovery. I always will. But it sucks that an organization that has so thoroughly changed (especially with the severing of ties with the LDS church in the US) may disappear.",

Twenty of them died and others are injured,\" Abdi Ahmed, deputy district commissioner of Qoryoley told reporters earlier.\n\n&gt;\"We request the government and aid agencies to clear mines and shells from the area,\" he added.\n\n&gt;Residents said that the unexploded shells, which were being played with by the children, were used by the waring factions in Somalia.",

[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The rest of the party is pretty much comprised of yes men with no spine to speak of. It'll likely drop to 5% within the next couple of yeas, its votes siphoned by the other two right wing parties as we saw in the recent elections.\nWithout Berlusconi, there is no Forza Italia.",

They seem like entertaining people. But why, for the love of w/e the fuck you find sacred, do you think they should be in charge of everything?\n\nIt's literally impossible to convince legitimately stupid people to make good decisions. Those same stupid people probably look back on this assholes blunders and complete lack of awareness as endearing. It's embarrassing. Imagine having Trump be a major fixture of your nations politics for three decades. Imagine what three decades of Trump would have done to our policies and outlook. Look what he's done to the US in such a short time.",

Berlusconi\u2019s personal hold on the party makes it vulnerable in his death, experts say, even as it is key to holding up Meloni\u2019s 8-month-old coalition government.",

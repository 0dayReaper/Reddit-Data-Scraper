            "comment": "These murders tend to be in one of 2 buckets:\n\n1. Murder of women by their husbands or his family. Women in the traditional Arab culture are property, and even in the almost-traditional Arab-Israeli culture they have far far less rights than men. That means that in the Arab villages and towns in Israel, the cultural laws outweigh the national laws, under which women have complete equality.\n\n2. Tribal/Family-related murders. The Arab society is divided into large families (hamulas) or tribes. Many times there are feuds between them, and revenge killing is the norm. By extension, their gangs, crime families, and criminal organizations are also family-based, so assassinations of members of another one of these is also common as it stems from the same cultural laws.",

Those are grim numbers for Israel, especially since it's a terrible rise from the previous year - 2022 had 111 murders in the Arab sector, and 2023 is nearly there with almost six months left to go.",

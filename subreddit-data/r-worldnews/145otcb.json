Back when the Soviet Union was still around, they were a formidable power and it was only in the 1970s that they started into stagnation and decline. That was a long time ago now but those older pieces of hardware weren't ready for museums back when the US was spending to counter the Soviets.",

They wanted to join. \n\nFinland and these other countries may have not been joining or trying to join Nato for protection from Russia if Russia didn't invade Ukraine.\n\nIt's like someone else telling you who any persons friends are.\n\nIt doesn't work for parents and it doesn't work for neighborhood bullies. By saying. \"I said you can't be friends with them and i won't allow it or i will make them not be your friend or i will tell them a bunch of lies about you so they won't. Or the they will be my friends instead after i say what i do to them or i force them to not be your friend too.\"\n\nThe bullies point of reference is that without friends they are weaker and there is nothing they can do about it and then they can get away with what they want to do to the person to control this person how they want including threatening or by attacking. They can then take what they want and abuse the other person. Make them feel helpless and many other things. Then they go on about how they can't get in trouble for it because you can't prove it sometimes and that they will lie in a court. And that they have a way with turning it around in there favor. Sometimes bullies murder too and and they lack empathy. They are also more likely to grow up or are already a rapist or a person who commits sex crimes against the unwilling people of the opposite or something same sex or even forcing sicker things on people. I have heard about sick bullies forcing people to do sick pervy shit to animals. Not much they won't do. Bully type, force people around and try to control them and push people around. The trying to be dominant over people they deem weaker. That's how much better they are than who they bully around. Those kinds of people often end up raping. Most bullies turn into future rapist who often get away with it. However i can't say they all do. A large percent of them do however by the time they are an adult or sometime when they are an adult or when they are a teenager still. Most bullies around bars and taverns are rapist but the woman don't tell. Some of those bullies brag about that stuff. So everytime we have known about a bully in the area that are an adult. We have learned that they are rapist either from women who won't do anything about it or from locals or from them bragging all around to their friends or others wherever they drink.\n\nWell guys. This is Russia right now but it's far worse.",

With Chechnya you have a point that there could be motive and there are people who would likely secretly want more independence. In a realistic political scene there is no way to get there though. Chechnya is tiny and would be totally disfunctional without support of a different state. Who do you see them allying with? Would Georgia be an option for either side?

Are there any domain experts, so historians or foreign policy professors etc, who are backing it up?\n\n&gt; It has the exact same credibility as anyone elses opinion.\n\nI disagree. Someone who never was in a given region, like Chechnya in this example, and wouldn't be able to even point to it on a map does not have the same credibility as someone who has been to these places and has a grasp on the people living there and their mentality. Not all opinions are created equal.",

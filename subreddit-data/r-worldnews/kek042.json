When I was there and staying on Rarotonga island, my number was 049 \n\nLicense plates are similarly small. R999 was pretty much the max plate there.",

What was wild was a blanket $20 per passenger taxi fare no matter how far you went! \n\nCircle the island? $20\nGo 2km up the road to the dive shop? $20\n\nI had a scooter hire which saved a lot of coin on cab fares, but one night when my ex and I went out for dinner the taxi ended up costing as much as the meal! \n\nThe entire Cook Islands is geared up as a honeymoon destination though, especially aitutaki Island and so everything has newlywed taxes on it. \n\nOur hotel on Rarotonga had a sister island at aitutaki and would offer \u201cupgrade\u201d offers under the door each night. $550NZD extra for 1 nights including transfers. \n\nDamn son! Suffice to say, we made do with the day trip and a cruise and stayed at our hotel (replete with statues of Tangaroa - the big dick sea god - out the front).",

We're being told that we should expect to be vaccinated by September 2021.",

Damage atrophies overtime, if not taken care of, so by the time the war is done they'll have even more to repair.\n\nBefore the reactors could even hope to be restarted they need to rebuild the dams, which will take a few years, adding to the time the systems are shutdown. Reactors don't do well when shut down, and not maintained, they'd need significant maintenance at a high costs. This all assumes the plant doesn't suffer additional outside damage too.\n\nIdeal case, you're looking at anywhere from 4-6 years before the plant could be brought back on line. The plant's cores were 30-40 years old, which means more than half the overall life span of the plant has already been used. It doesn't make a lot of economic sense to pump money into something that will only have 15-25 more years in it. Plus there will be continued risk from Russia unless there's a massive regime change.\n\nI doubt this plant will be operational again. Maybe 1 or 2 of the reactors, but you're unlikely to see all 6 back online again. IMO.",

Plant costs go up over time and maintenance needs increase due to age. In general cores are not designed to operate past 50 years. Anything beyond that is outside their operational life. Yes, we can and often do push that to 60 years, but the cost of upkeep goes up substantially after that point, and that's in an ideal case. Eventually the costs to keep a core online out way the costs of tearing it down and installing a new one.\n\nAgain, in an ideal case. With the possibility of damage from the war, that would be made even worse. \n\nThe time effort and money spent on bring this plant back online probably isn't worth it in the long term, and certainly isn't in the short term.",

Further more it's only direct capital costs, it doesn't include ongoing maintenance or operational costs which will also increase year over year, and may increase because of the refresh. You're still adding costs to a preexisting setup, that doesn't make it cheaper. Given these updates have life expectancy too (about 20 years), it's going to be an on going cost. The $40 LCOE referenced only considers this update (not preexisting and other on going costs, and it's questionable if they're even including true decommission costs), it also makes some very aggressive assumptions about power output that are not realistic.\n\nAll that assumes a lot about the site too, in the case of Zaporizhzhia where damage is significant, your costs will likely be outside those ranges.",

The reactors are inherently self regulating (the liquid gets hot, expands, slowing down the rate of fission) and are walk-away safe.   If for some reason an MSR reactor does get too hot, a freeze plug melts, the fluid drains from the reactor vessel into an outflow tank designed to shut the reaction down.",

Early salt reactor tests had fires that couldn't be put out for months.\n\nAdd to that the added complexities (and cost) of waste extraction from molten salts, and general costs associated with running it all, there are cheaper and better alternatives.\n\nAs for walk-away safe, that's a buzz-word without meaning. No plant or reactor design can be left alone for prolonged periods. You might get away with 24 hours (which is what most define as walk-away), but that assumes the plant was in good order to begin with. In the case of damage, that no longer holds. Also those outflow tanks, they would need to be handled an monitored as soon as the process started. It contains the problem, but it doesn't stop it.",

Stainless steel alloys capable of resisting the corrosive salts were developed.\n\nNo, not at those temperatures or in those considerations. Neutron flux alone would damage any galvanized coating used, and once that happens the salts will attack the Fe atoms in the pipe. The extreme heats would cause further issues. You need ceramic or glass based piping systems. They're not unusual, but they have their own issues.\n\n&gt;There wasn't in later phases of development. They were developing a new technology and learned from their mistakes, \n\nIf by later phases you mean in the past few years you'd technically be correct. Molten salts were generally abandoned after the 60s due to the problems it has, and the difficulties in dealing with it. Including the removable of waste and byproducts which still has not been solved fully. It's only been the past few years that some countries have seriously started re-investigating the problem.\n\n&gt;From what I understand, the tanks are designed to let the molten liquid spread out enough that the fission reaction is slowed to the point insufficient heat is generated and it solidifies.\n\nIt's not that simple, first off, you have extremely high temperature, highly (chemically reactive) salts. You have to monitor the tanks to ensure there's no secondary reactions going on or gas leaks. Solidification can take days, or longer. Any imperfections, and I mean any, can cause a serious breach. If you expose molten salts to the atmosphere, at those temperatures, you risk fire and explosions due to hydrogen production.\n\nThey contain the problem, they don't stop it, and they need to be actively monitored and dealt with immediately. It's not risk free by any stretch.",

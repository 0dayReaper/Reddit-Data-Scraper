They spent all that time and money in preservation efforts just to place these creatures directly back into the habitat that they were being poached into extinction from in the first place.\n\nThe title of \u201cnational park\u201d or \u201creserve\u201d will not stop any poacher or wealthy European/American/Chinese/Saudi hunter looking for an illegal thrill. They couldn\u2019t then and still can\u2019t defend nature, in the designated National Parks, what makes them think anything\u2019s changed since?\n\nThey just kept and bred these creatures to basically send them all right back into the jaws of death and desperation. Acclimated to the presence of humans just enough that they won\u2019t know when to run.\n\nUnbelievable.",

In Fribourg, rainbow flags had been destroyed on Georges-Python Square at the end of May. The organisers recalled that while the right to marry for all represented a historic step forward last year, the queer community was facing a return of insults and violence.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/146oqgf/tens_of_thousands_celebrate_geneva_pride/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688501 tl;drs so far.\") | [Service Blackout](https://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/146cacj/joining_the_blackout_a_message_from_uautotldr/ \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **people**^#1 **march**^#2 **right**^#3 **more**^#4 **published**^#5",

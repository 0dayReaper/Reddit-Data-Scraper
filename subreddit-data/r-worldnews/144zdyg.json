Escaping refugees doesn't prove the US policy is good, just simply that Cubans are suffering and hope for a better life.\n\nI understand the internal US politics prevent people from disrupting the status quo without significant cost.",

In Donald Trump's first few months, the white house pivoted and closed the door on Cuba, specifically revoking travel and what little prospect for trade. The United States was on track to cool ties with Cuba up to 2019, then Trump axed years of work. So I think it's fair to partially blame Trump for Cuba getting closer to China.",

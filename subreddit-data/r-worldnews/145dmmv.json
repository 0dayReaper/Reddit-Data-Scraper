We expect the preliminary decision on the implementation of the nuclear reactor construction project by Rosatom in Hungary to be reviewed,\" the Ukrainian prime minister stated, according to MTI, the Hungarian State News Agency.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; He added that he had already raised this issue in his speech at the ministerial-level meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Council in Paris on Wednesday.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"In light of the disaster at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant and the Russian seizure of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, such decisions seem surreal,\" Smihal stressed. He said sanctions against Russia should be tightened, especially in areas such as nuclear energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; We recently reported on the EU having given the green light for the modification of the contract for the expansion of the Paks nuclear plant, and also detailed some of the questions surrounding the project.",

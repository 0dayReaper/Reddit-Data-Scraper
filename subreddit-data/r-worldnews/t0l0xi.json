I suspect that the Russians threw everything they had at holding that airport and the fact that they couldn't means that unit is probably on borrowed time and will surrender soon.",

But from my understanding their push from Crimea was also halted, which is important to cover forces that fighting with DPR/LPR who achieved literally nothing today in their attempts to break through.",

They would be right, but they are also missing the point. \n\nRemember, every one of those soldiers wants to go home at the end of the day. Would you want to be the first one through if it mean a 50/50 chance of eating a 7.62x39 round? There are far more of you than there are of them. If enough of those door kickers get blown away, they'll have no choice but to stop or escalate. But then you ask, if they escalate then wouldn't we be dead? You were dead to begin with. What's stopping them from leveling the entire apartment block as-is? In the case of these Russians, they don't want to rule over a pile of ashes. Furthermore, indiscriminately taking out entire buildings will only galvanize resistance towards them.\n\nObviously it's easy for me to sit here and type this up like I'm some sort of internet badass, but this is how occupiers have been traditionally been fought. You make it so bloody and unpleasant as possible that they give up.",

An occupation of Ukraine will eventually fail either due to war exhaustion and a lack of popular support both in the military and the civilian population, or just crippling effects of sanctions they are facing.\n\nWestern countries could very well push for Crimea to be returned to Ukraine as a condition for sanctions to be removed and that would open up eligibility for Ukraine to then join NATO.  The saddest thing about this though is it could take years of occupation, world pressure, and war crimes against the civilian population before we get to this stage.",

Russia will be using any leverage it has against the wealthy and powerful to push for easing them and deflect media attention from the war.\n\n\nI feel for Ivan Q. Proletariat in Russia as well but they've been too complacent with Putin's regime for too long.  You can only have a dictatorship for so long until something goes horribly wrong.  Hopefully strong arm leadership comes off looking less attractive after this.",

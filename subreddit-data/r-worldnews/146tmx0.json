White flag WW2 references are insensitive, inappropriate and inconsiderate of the great pains France endured during WW2, especially in this case where the Organizer of a festival (unjustly) denies entrance to a Taiwanese group because of extortion by its Chinese counterpart; nothing to do with the government of France. Even if statements by Macron have been unfortunate at best in the past.\n\nAnd the US are a beacon of freedom just like France, those two countries are close allies, both have flaws and (rightfully) act in the interest of their population (mostly), even if that means making compromises (while some of those compromises really seem to have been misjudgments).\n\nAt the end of the day they are pretty United on issues like the Russian war of aggression and even Chinas threats towards Taiwan; they share values much deeper than some opportunistic policies.",

When the delegation arrived they noticed that the flags of every country in the world were represented all around the hall and ofc there was the taiwanese one. \nFew whispering in the ears later , they had us ask the school to empry the hall and send the students in the yard, so that they could take off the taiwanese flag. \nTaiwan is a big nono for china and no country wants to fuck up their economy by breaking ties with China.",

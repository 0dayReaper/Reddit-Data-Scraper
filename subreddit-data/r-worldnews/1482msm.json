[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1.

So far, there has not been independent verification of the dam\u2019s destruction, although a time-lapse video presented below, from the Sentinel Hub satellite data provider, does appear to show almost all the water leaving the Staromlynivske Reservoir behind the dam. While Ukrainian accounts suggest some kind of explosion breaching the dam, it remains possible that Russian forces may have simply opened sluices to drain the reservoir as quickly as possible.",

There are also some SWIR bands on there and Sentinel 2 that I think should see through clouds but I haven\u2019t really looked at that.\n\nSentinel 1 (edit: I said 3 erroneously before) has SAR which can see through the clouds fine. I know you can reconstruct a DEM from that (though haven\u2019t done it myself). Much less accessible but might be worthwhile for someone to try. (?)\n\nUpdate: last Landsat overfly was yesterday, but the clouds cover it all up. I tried looking at the SWIR bands and there is still way too much cloud cover. Looking at the SAR data on Sentinel Hub for the last overflights of the area the water stands out pretty clearly and is consistent up until the 11th when there is significantly less.\n\nOk update to the update. Here are the coordinates I'm looking at:\n47.675054, 36.875126\nHere's a link to 2 screen grabs, one for 6/8 and one for 6/11:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/jfN6Y7v\n\nEdit to the edit to the edit: I should have just read the article, this is basically what they did (SAR) and they even gave coordinates.

Which would only make more sense after seeing what happened in Germany with the soviets. The allies knew that the USSR was going to be a problem after WW2 and wanted to keep them from the negotiation table in Japan. There really wasn't a need for the propaganda to take the heat off of the killed civilians from the two nuclear bombs bc more civilians were killed by firebombing Japan, which would almost have certainly continued prior to an all out invasion of the Japanese mainland. As terrible as it sounds, dropping the nuclear bombs on Japan most likely resulted in less deaths than taking Japan by invasion and a more standard overtaking of the country, especially if the Japanese army continued with their no-surrender, fight-to-the-death ideology. This invasion force would also include the red army, which wasn't known for treating civilians very well",

That doesn't go against the theory that they wanted to end it before the Russians could get involved in the Pacific theater. They dropped the first bomb as soon as they could, and dropped the 2nd after issuing a warning to Japan, which went ignored. The Manhattan project wasn't completed overnight and the US had done projections of what they thought it would take for a full scale invasion of the Japanese mainland and they expected a huge amount of casualties if they did invade so they decided to go with the bomb when it was ready. This served to show the world what they now had in their arsenal and to expedite the end of the war without a very bloody invasion. It was a terrible thing to do to the Japanese civilians going about their daily lives, but it did most likely result in less deaths than an all out invasion would have.",

Gaining the entirety of Ukraine in one go is now out of reach, but he's willing to pay the long game by negotiating a \"peace\" deal car both cripples what's left of Ukraine and leaves open a wide door to annexing more territory unopposed.",

During World War II, Soviet commanders destroyed bridges and a dam at Zaporizhzhia to prevent German forces from crossing the Dnipro River and slow their advance, **killing many civilians in the process**, too.\n\nI wonder if we will ever get to the place of holding governments resposible for the human suffering and death they cause to civilians?",

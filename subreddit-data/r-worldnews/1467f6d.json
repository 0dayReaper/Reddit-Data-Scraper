And in general, if other people find your holy site holy, that means your religion is succeeding.\n\nAnd on top of that, let's just add that it was a Jewish holy site waaaaay before Islam was even founded. Let's put it this way: the Al Aqsa mosque was established where it is in the late seventh or early eighth century (the original structure fell in an earthquake and was rebuilt, so all those right-wing ultra zionist nationalists saying it was built in the 11th century are being dishonest at best) meanwhile the Jewish Temple was first *destroyed* in 538 BCE. And it had been standing for hundreds of years. In other words, for well over 1,000 years it was a Jewish holy site, before Islam was even a thing! And yet you claim that the Jews are coming into the Muslim's \"house\"?!",

However, so as not upset the Muslims, and potentially start large scale riots, the police give in to Muslim/Jordanian/Waqf threats and suspend this freedom of religion for Jews in the name of public security. Essentially bowing down to threats of violence.\n\nOver the past few years, Jews have been pushing back on this artificial restriction of the police. \n\nAs for young arabs being restricted from the temple mount, the solution is simple. Arabs ascending to the temple mount should need to undergo security checks, just as Jews do before entering the western wall plaza. If youthful arabs were not able to bring weapons and fireworks onto the temple mount, there would be less rioting, and less reason to restrict them.  (Oh Yeah, when Israel tried requiring security checks, there was major outrage in the arab world. So....)",

The Western Wall is a Jewish holy site, not a Muslim holy site.  And AFAIK it gained significance because historically it's been the closest site to the Temple Mount that Jews could pray at (and still is).  Muslims literally can just go to the Temple Mount, so this would have zero impact on them.  \n\nOTOH the Temple Mount site is holy to both religions.  So different situation.\n\n&gt;  Not to mention that Jews are literally not allowed to live to practice judaism in nearly every single Muslim majority nation\n\nThat doesn't sound right.  Iran (and there aren't many countries more hardline Islamic than Iran) certainly has a Jewish population, which is protected under their laws and which has representation in their parliament.  And that's *Iran.*  \n\nThere aren't big Jewish populations in many other Muslim countries, but that's down in part to emigration to Israel / the US and their not having big Jewish communities in general, not really laws AFAIK.",

Jerusalem involves two states directly, the entire region politically, and three global religions.\n\n&gt;Imagine if someone said the same for Vatican City or Mecca or Medina. \n\nAnother horrible analogy. Those sites are only holy for one faith, and there isn't the long history of religious strife there is in Jerusalem. \n\n&gt; Yet somehow we are supposed to put perfect trust in this hypothetical international entity\n\nThe mere fact that it's an international entity and not one of the parties directly involved is an improvement already tbh. Israel doesn't trust Palestine and vice versa. The international entity won't be perfect but in theory it lets shit be hashed out without domestic politics of both countries getting too involved.\n\nAnd before you nitpick, yes, domestic Israeli politics would still get involved, but there'd be a layer of insulation, at least.\n\n&gt;Believe it or not, the status quo is much more equitable than any international organization can deliver. \n\nIt's not really a permanent solution though.

And which feels it's still being hard done by, given the settlements.  \n\nAlso worth noting that the Temple Mount is in East Jerusalem.  Which is part of the West Bank, and as such is technically supposed to be Palestinian land.  And AFAIK is generally recognized as such, internationally.  So Palestinians look at it as their rightful land which is being occupied by a foreign power.  \n\n&gt;Hamas is saying do that and we will commit terrorist attacks.\n\nWorth noting here that the news source is pretty closely linked to Netanyahu.  AFAIK it's far-right as fuck.  And that the dude proposing all this is a far right ultranationalist doing all this in part to stir up their base.  And that his plan would have Israel controlling the Dome, not the Waqf.  \n\nObviously not condoning anything Hamas does, but there are absolutely grey areas in this.  Like... I think everyone wants peace and stability in the region, this'd just be a massive step back.",

Every chief Rabbi of Israel has adamantly insisted that it is absolutely forbidden. All of the ultra-Orthodox Rabbis have also held the view that it is forbidden according to Jewish law. Not a single Charedi/chassidic MK has ever ascended. \n\nIt is a huge fallacy all this religious zealot nonsense. Nothing has  changed. Barak and olmert weren't corrupt? Nobody's rights are being taken away. Netanyahu may be currupt but he cares about Israel being a Jewish State. He didn't steal the election. Respect the Israeli voter. \n\nToday that's right wing fascism - it should be a state of all it's people, a liberal democratic state.  The Jews could have this in Uganda  In reality the land of Israel and the Jews are inseparable. \n\nWhy is it prohibited ?\n\nTwo reasons, the first everyone will think is nonsense, the second is purely practical.\n\nJews believe that we are prohibited from walking in certain areas of Har Habayis (Temple Mount) due to the overwhelming holiness and purity. The effect is that the person's soul is \"cut off\" - there are plenty of Rabbis who do ascend claiming to know where it is ok. But they don't represent all orthodox Jews! They are a minority! \n\nThe second reason is well... A matter of life and death. It is antithetical to Judaism to provoke a religious war. Jews will die Gd forbid so the state can make a political statement?\n\nIt's not splitting Jerusalem! Israel isn't giving them anything. Just letting the Jordanian Wakf control it. And what a spectacular job so far...",

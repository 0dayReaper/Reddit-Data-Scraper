It's far-fetched to believe they had any involvement whatsoever, because they are thousands of kilometres/miles away and they're one of two doubly-landlocked countries, with likely limited experience on undersea demolition operations.  \n\nThis past winter, though, they started importing gas from Russia, despite typically being a gas-exporting country.  Apparently, it was a very cold winter in Uzbekistan.\n\nA very unlikely motive would be that to reduce Germany's demand for Russian gas, and potentially increase their own prominence as a potential importer, Uzbekistan was involved.  This is not serious speculation at all, but has anyone come out with a definitive list of who has been ruled out?",

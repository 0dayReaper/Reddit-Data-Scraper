He made Russian his minor and went to Russia with a group during spring break and claims the dude he met in the group wants to open a restaurant with him in a small town north of Moscow.  He claims the ESL program is great because they partner foreign teachers with opposite sex Russian to help you around Russia kinda like a translator/guide.  \n\nAnyway he dropped out of college when covid began and was paranoid that the apartment manager was stalking him.  That grew to them leaving my state because he convinced his father they were being watched.  Once said a helicopter was following him.  Dude really needs some psychiatric help.  Now he's reading junk on Telegram and feels the USA is his enemy\n\nEdit:  I hate Telegram.  It's brainwashed my friend, and my former coworker was so far gone that she believed the wealthy were building underground tunnels to secretly deal in underage sex slavery.  Had a small earthquake near Shanghai back in 2022 and she said it was the elite building their tunnels.",

First you compare both countries when it comes to freedom of speech and try to juxtapose it with women rights, but this time you don't say US, you use TEXAS specifically.\n\nYou know very well there are 49 other states in the US and in some of those you actually have more rights as a woman than in Russia.\n\nBTW: I am not an American myself, I don't care where you live and what you do.

There are several roadblocks in place, for example the American spouse has to show enough income to prove that he/she has enough money to feed the family (which isn\u2019t much if you live in the U.S., a bit more than a poverty level, but a whole other story if you live abroad where average pay is much lower). \n\nAnd now Russian citizens are not able to get a U.S. visa in Moscow and have to travel to a dedicated embassy, which is in Warsaw. But guess what - Poland stopped issuing travel visas to Russians in 2020 and just never resumed the service. So people have to apply for something like a tourist visa to France, basically lie about the purpose of the trip on their visa application, and people working at the French embassy often deny visas because, well, they are not stupid. So then you have to start contacting all the other U.S. embassies in the world describing your case and praying that they will take it (they don\u2019t have an obligation to do so), or at least acknowledge the receipt of your email... I know people that contacted every embassy they could physically go to, received denial letter to got no response at all, and had to start contacting them again, until someone finally took a pity on them. \n\nSo even after your spouses\u2019s and/or children\u2019s immigration cases had been approved by the USCIS, it could still take months to actually get a visa and come to the US. \n\nSource: helped several relatives obtain immigrant visas in the past few years.",

My sister\u2019s case was accepted in Rio de Janeiro (lucky, no visa!), a friend of mine went to Uruguay, another friend flew to Papua New Guinea.

[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Lauterbach then revised the proposal to not include commercial trade, but allowing people to grow their own and trade privately in what he calls \"social clubs\". That way, many people would have access to it, without the feared \"drug industry\". \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't mind either and would be excited if the state would rake in fucktons of taxes, but I also think that the current proposal is kinda cute and makes sense for me. I don't want to consume it, I just like the plants and want to grow some to give it away.",

The Swedish government is progressive with regards to certain issues, but it can really be ass backwards in others.\n\nEdit: Wanted to add that it's not just government policy, a lot of Swedes will stigmatise you if they know you consume it. The whole \"weed is a gateway drug\" mantra is very much alive there.",

Czechia doesn\u2019t have a left-wing party in national government right now, the Estonian right-wing historically does very well, and Hungary is oddly nonreligious.

In most cases such a conversation lasts an hour and the woman cannot be denied an abortion by the counseling center. It's meant to be a counseling session, not an interrogation.

Not to say your other points aren't true, but if you are referring to the legalization in 2015 a lot of the rights benefits were already present for gay couples.

The EU simply does not allow a country to Legalize a substance, because of the Schengen Area (vis free travel to any EU country, no border checks no passport needed, nothing). The EU believes if one country legalizes something, that criminal groups will use that to transport it freely between all EU countries. Thats why the Netherlands never legalized it. Its just tolerated. Germany is in heavy fight with the EU and until they dont give the go, germany can do shit (well they could do things, but those would make relations a bit worse)",

However little to nothing ever comes from that.\n\nThe only real threat is not to be reelected, but we have more than enough cases of politicians who acted unethical etc but reelection didn't matter cause they already filled their coffers or secure a lucrative position in some major company for their lobbying services. \n\nJust look at the current climate change policy which was deemed as unconstitutional by our Verfassungsgericht! Did that change any policies or anything at all? Not really despite that we now know for sure that Olaf Scholz' promise to be the \"climate chancellor\" was a big joke to begin with",

You said it yourself, you lead a very happy life. And if you do, do as you please. \n\nWhat we are lamenting here is substance dependence to a level where you need a hit to function even a little.\n\nWhat we're trying to say is that if you are in such situation, you have serious issues.\n\nFor you, personally, that's clearly not the case, and to the guy above neither, but you both seemed to misunderstand the meaning of what we are trying to convey.",

MY tiny brain understanding is that this trade deal will open up a Brexit-wounded electronics industry to the subsidies provided by the US government which, in my mind, means that US taxpayers are getting bent to let the UK sell us marked-up green energy related products and recover after their ham-handed exit from the EU? please tell me I'm wrong, and that I should be excited about this portion of trade deal?",

It reaffirms the special relationship with US &amp; UK.\n\nAn important goal for the US is finding strategic partners that will help provide security in different areas of the globe, so the US doesn't need to do all the heavy lifting. British soft power, global reach, naval tradition, and a strong history of partnering with the US makes them one of the ideal candidates.\n\nIf the UK needs a boost to shift directions, I'm confident none of that will be wasted money. This deal sounds like it will be a massive savings for the US in the long run. Details pending of course.",

I'm all for a stronger UK/US partnership, be it economically or otherwise, but this seems like a really odd way to go about it? it kind of bypasses the new money theory these green-deal subsidies so often operate on. they're taking it out of their left pocket but failing to return it to their right? I guess it's confusing me because it doesn't appear to directly benefit the corporatocracy. color me surprised!",

The UK is one of the few that hasn\u2019t and won\u2019t for some time.\n\nEssentially we make a good closer trade partner to the USA, we both have very balanced and strong consumer markets whilst the rest of the developed world essentially is seeking to dump excess production on us. Older worker are more productive, Europe is highly productive but has few young people to absorb that productivity. China is similar.\n\nTo avoid this the USA and the UK will need to carefully select partners to trade with more.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; Rishi Sunak and Joe Biden have agreed a new partnership to bolster economic security in response to the growing threat of China.\n\n&gt; Brushing off his failure to deliver on the Tory manifesto promise to land a full-fat free trade deal with the US, the prime minister and US president announced the Atlantic Declaration during a meeting at the White House.\n\n&gt; The new accord contains an in-principle agreement for a deal on those minerals - used to make a range of products from solar panels to electric vehicles - to give UK exporters access to the huge $370bn green subsidies programme, the Inflation Reduction Act, introduced by President Biden to turbocharge huge green investment in the US. The US signed a similar deal with Japan earlier this year to prohibit the two countries from enacting bilateral export restrictions on the minerals most critical for electric batteries - lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite and manganese.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/144henf/uk_and_us_agree_new_partnership_to_boost_economic/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~688193 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **deal**^#1 **new**^#2 **trade**^#3 **president**^#4 **agreement**^#5",

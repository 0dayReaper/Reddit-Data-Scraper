[Several](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/) [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/144gmfq/rif_will_shut_down_on_june_30_2023_in_response_to/) of commercial third-party apps have announced that this change will compel them to shut down their apps. At least [one accessibility-focused non-commercial third party app](https://www.reddit.com/r/DystopiaForReddit/comments/145e9sk/update_dystopia_will_continue_operating_for_free/) will continue to be available free of charge.\n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Limit your involvement with Reddit, or\n2. Temporarily refrain from using Reddit\n\nas a way to voice your protest, specifically on June 12 and June 13, the days of the planned protest.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that some subreddit moderators have made the decision to take their subreddits private, we ultimately do not believe it is our place as moderators to impose such a decision on all users of this community. \n\nWe respect your right to make your own decision.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Bolsonaro gave him a military salute.\n\nall that trump says in the USA, Bolsonaro did, and does, in Brazil: COVID is a hoax, vax will kill you, the elections are frauded, the \"people\" needs to \"take back\" the country and, more recently, the supreme court is being weaponized by \"The Left\" to take him, the \"favourite\", from future elections.\nand our maga crappers, damn, all day and night reading fake news and habbenings on their social media's. I lost count how many times a particularly hated judge from the supreme court has being jailed in their subs...\n\na big difference is that here the military DO get out of their way to support Bolsonaro. thank the gods they haven't the numbers nor the will do venture in a full coup, but there was much planning and hooping for one among way to many high patent officers both in the polices and military.\n\nwe even had our own 1/6, that happened on 1/8 in here, when +-5k \"\"good citizens\" invaded and vandalized the buildings of the supreme court, presidency and Congress... on a sunday.\n\noh, men, how they celebrate that day. they were so happy to topple the government... on a sunday.\n\nsunday, when no one was there. no president, no judge, no nobody except the skeleton crews.\n\nGod, they are so stupid...",

Brazilian military has been always close to the US than any other country. Gezz, Brazil had a right wing military dictatorship for decades sponsored by USA while the URSS was sponsoring opposite left groups in the country for decades. Not sure if you don't know history of South America or what...\n\nThe fact that some Ukranian soldiers are using symbols close to the ones from WW2 Germany only makes these neo nazis groups even more against Russia.",

He only stopped sucking american shoes after the new president was elected and decided to take revenge against Bolsonaro for supporting a political enemy. The Americans blocked some military deals with Brazil, in specific with nuclear Submarines that would crush the Brazilian Navy dream project for decades (remember how the Brazilian military is very close to the right wing and Bolsonaro? Now Bolsonaro had to find a new partner to give the nuclear submarine technology to the Navy since the old one was screwed up). If you payed attention you would see the shit face he was making to the cameras vising Russia and even paying respects to communist soldiers in a event there (something everyone in the country, left and right joked about, he looked ridiculous there, years talking against communists and then vising Russia to pay respects to them), but it was what left for him after his disastrous support in a external political election in the US.",

Most Spaniards moved to their colonies. The Portuguese, on the other hand, make up the single largest contributor for the Brazilian gene pool, not to say all Brazilians have Portuguese ancestors (many don\u2019t), but even Brazilians who appear strictly of African descent might have Portuguese ancestors because they had a stranglehold on political, economic and social power.\n\nThe vast, vast majority of German Brazilians descend from Germans from before WWII. Most Germans arrived in Brazil in the 19th century and are the third largest European ethnicity in Brazil, behind the Portuguese and Italians. Many Brazilians have majoritarian or exclusive German ancestry, the likelihood varying from location.\n\nZero Brazilians have Mengele as an ancestor as his only child never lived in Brazil.",

                    "comment": "Brazil is a very diverse society. The Brazilian population is composed of people from nearly every corner of the Earth, and Brazil never had the restrictions that existed in the US on \u201crace miscegenation\u201d, so the majority of Brazilians are of mixed origin. The majority doesn\u2019t mean all, however. Brazil has received many waves of immigrants from Europe, West Asia and even from East Asia, it has had many West Africans brought to the country during the Atlantic Slave Trade era plus its original Amerindian population. So while these groups mat have integrated and mixed Brazil has never achieved a homogeneity in its racial composition: there are people who descend exclusively from one group, and people who are a mix of all groups.\n\nThe racial diversity of Brazil actually leads to such a gradient of appearances that Brazilians often have difficulty putting races into neat boxes like in the US, with the definition of black, pardo (brown), white, etc changing from area to area and even person to person. Race is Brazil is subjective and fluid. Brazilians don\u2019t usually care about blood quotas either, so racial determination is done nearly exclusively by phenotypic appearance. In fact, it could happen that you may be considered brown or even white in one region of Brazil and, by moving to another, be recategorised as black. Usually the higher predominance of European phenotypes in a area the more strict people are about what constitutes whiteness.\n\nAs such, neonazism in Brazil operates on the basis of whatever is considered white in the location the cell exists. Which might lead to funny situations where one neonazi might be seen as brown or black to another neonazi group. That said, Brazil still has many people who descend exclusively from Europeans and some neonazi groups might incorporate that, too. Some might get even more strict with promoting a single origin, like German.\n\nSo that\u2019s how it operates, it is neonazism but it doesn\u2019t follow the exact same rules as other neonazist groups elsewhere, for the most time.\n\nRace in Brazil is complicated. For example there\u2019s this other commenter here, Sure Garbage 2119, who is sustaining that all Brazilians are mixed and some just look whiter than others. That\u2019s a common rebuttal of Nazi rhetoric in Brazil, the idea that all Brazilians are mixed, and as such neonazism is idiotic. Neonazism is idiotic, but not for that reason, it\u2019s idiotic because it operates on false assumptions of one\u2019s group superiority over another and the cruel ramifications of that. Downplaying the white identity of white Brazilians is often used in order to undermine said identity. As I said above, reality doesn\u2019t exactly correspond with that: most Brazilians are mixed, often European and African, but different regions of Brazil were colonised differently, by different groups and at different times, and there are many pockets of populations that descend exclusively from one group or another, including Europeans. Unfortunately that commenter, despite being obviously against racism still isn\u2019t afraid of using the term Latino to refer to Brazilians, which is not only incorrect but might be seen as offensive: latino is a primarily US based label for descendants of people from Ibero-American countries (Portuguese or Spanish majority speaking countries), regardless of race. The reason it\u2019s offensive is because Brazilians in Brazil are Brazilians, and Latino is a loaded term which often conjures images of Central Americans Spanish speakers with Indigenous or European-Indigenous ancestry, which doesn\u2019t correspond to the vast majority of Brazilians, much less Brazilians in Brazil.\n\nAlso, since white Brazilians historically dominate economic, social and political roles, there\u2019s an overrepresentation in the institutions of power.\n\nTL;DR: There are white Brazilians. But more importantly, what is white in Brazil isn\u2019t a strict as in some other places.",

As for EU measures to follow, it's hard to predict exactly what they will entail, but it's likely that there will be some kind of intervention or sanctions imposed. It's important to keep up with current events and stay informed on the developments in this situation.",

Kosovo has faced numerous challenges in terms of diplomacy and international relations. As for the potential EU measures, it's hard to say for sure what they will be, but it's likely that they will be aimed at addressing some of the issues that were discussed during these talks. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing situation.",

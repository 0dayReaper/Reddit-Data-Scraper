Such a ruling could boost legal claims for damages or reparations from not only Ukraine but also individual victims of the conflict.\u201d",

That doesn't allow for evolution of an organization.   Take a fair look at what the UN does and compare that to what it SHOULD be doing.   It should be protecting human rights.  It should be operationalizing the implementation of human rights standards but it has zero authority to enforce anything.   And the fact that Russia sits on the UN security council is a joke.  If the UN had any power it would have kicked Russia out and led the world in its own UNSC mission statement which is \"ensuring international peace and security\".   How's that going?   Instead it is used to give rogue nations a platform to spew rhetoric and lies and continue to operate and terrorize the rest of the world.  It doesn't get involved in major conflicts.  It doesn't recognize Taiwan and believes in the One-China policy.  I could go on and on.  \n\nEven the South Park creators made fun of it in their movie - \"we will be very, very angry with you and we will write you a letter telling you how angry we are.\"   It's outdated and their 3.4B budget could be used somewhere else.   The world has changed drastically since WW2 and it was a good idea at the time, but the organization has not adapted to the changing world.",

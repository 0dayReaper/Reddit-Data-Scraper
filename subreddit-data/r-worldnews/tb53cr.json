Their military from overall operations and strategy to 1-5 star reviews on their rations; their political structure from overall messaging to individual personal reactions on social media; all being aggregated and analyzed.\n \nThe thing that sucks is that Russia is only going to contract after this.",

Even then you're never 100% safe, because you never know what capability the threat agents have (see below for RAM being used as a NIC). Any time you're dealing with these situations, never ever do it near devices that contain your personal information. Also never trust that a deep level disk wipe is enough, literally buy a new drive and image it for testing. \n\nTl;dr there are many ways to safely contain a fire, but you are never 100% protected from burning the building down regardless of what you do.",

In Russia, it's basically endorsed by the government,\n\nhttps://darknetdiaries.com/episode/110/\n\nThe two largest botnets in the world, both Russian, set up fake pharamacy sites  and sold globally, starting with fake products and placebo pills, and eventually getting large enough and enough connections they got real pills even.  \n\nIt all came crashing down, simply because the two had a rivalry and hated each other,  \n\nThey had the largest affiliate accounts where their links and affiliate groups were making hand over fist so much they even had dummy accounts that were still in the top 10 of most funded affiliate accounts.\n\n&gt;So, on September 2, 2007, Nikolai McColo was riding in a BMW through Moscow.  The driver was a guy named Jaks, a known Russian spammer.  When they got to an intersection in the middle of Moscow city, a Porsche drove up beside them.  Jaks and Nikolai looked over at the Porsche.  Both cars came to a red light and stopped side by side.  One of them revved the engine; the other revved back.  A race was about to begin.  When the lights turned green, both cars roared off at high speed, but it all went wrong.  Jaks lost control of his car.  The BMW went into a spin and clipped the corner of the Porsche.\n\n\n\n&gt;Both cars went screaming off the road, and the BMW went straight into a lamppost.  It totally destroyed the car, and Nikolai was killed instantly at the age of twenty-three.  Jaks and the guy driving the Porsche walked away with minor injuries.  This was big news across the spammer community.\n\nLike 30% of all botnet spam traffic disappeared in a single night.",

A speech given by the Trump Campaign's Foreign Policy Advisor, who then went on to drunkenly brag about establishing a backchannel between the Trumps and Moscow in order to help Trump win the 2016 election.

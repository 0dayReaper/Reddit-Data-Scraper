Probably the biggest though is that it disrupts their regular season schedule and exposes their players to potentially serious injuries.  In some Olympics it's worth it for them anyways.  Like when it was in Canada, there at least weren't travel issues, and then it would have been a big headache for them not to participate in the Russian games given the Russian stars that make the NHL their home.  However, South Korea isn't as exciting a destination for the NHL.\n\nThey tried to get some degree of compensation out of the IOC in exchange for their continued participation and didn't succeed in that, which led to the NHL pulling out.  Perhaps they'll be back in 2022 given that those Olympics will be in China and the NHL wants to grow the game there.",

The guy took up swimming eight months before the event, practiced in a lake somewhere in Equatorial Guinea, and had up until the event never seen a full-sized Olympic swimming pool before in his life.\n\nShows that it's not necessarily about winning or breaking world records. It's about participating, about doing one's best. Pretty sure that when he was completely spent with 20 meters to go, all that carried him to the finish line was the amazing crowd that cheered for him as if he was Phelps.\n\n(Honorable mention to Robel Kieros Habte, representing Ethiopia (and dadbods worldwide) that [finished a similar race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1j7y1BDlA4) against actual people.)",

The methods in place to prevent doping are hardly effective due to the disconnection between those who are policing the athletes and the Olympic organization themselves who are just as corrupt as the Russian government.",

Fearing for his life, Rodchenkov fled to the U.S. with Fogel's help and confessed on camera that he oversaw the swapping out of hundreds of athletes' urine samples during the Sochi games. \"\n\nFogel is the filmmaker. While I do not know the exact extent in which he \"helped\" Rodchenkov escape. He certainly played a role in helping not only protect the whistleblower to get him out of the country, he also helped to shed light on the entire controversy.\n\nI'd say it was an important factor from what I've read/seen.

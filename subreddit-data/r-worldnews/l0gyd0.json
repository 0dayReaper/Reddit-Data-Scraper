Yes that's right, a significant portion of Hong Kongers have a type of British nationality, and it's them and their kids and spouses who will be allowed to come to the UK. These people are also entitled to British Passports, they always have been; which is kind of a joke because the passport doesn't give you right to live in the UK.",

It still gives you the right to visa free travel to the UK, to vote in the UK if you are a resident, and provides an easier path to citizenship.\n\nAnd that's not getting into the benefits extended as a result of this policy now.",

Parents can be born overseas too in some circumstances. If you are born overseas and claim is coming through your dad they needed to be married before your birth. IIRC under the 2006 rule changes they brought in a think where you can register based on your father's nationality for a nominal fee, (&lt;\u00a3100). He'd need to be named on your birth cert though. Look into registration with UKVI. \n\nIf they were married before your birth, your dad is named on your birth cert and he is a BC under a section he can pass on claim, then the examiner fucked up or there is something else in the background.",

Programs like TeachFirst get you working in the classroom unqualified almost immediately and within two years you\u2019re fully qualified making full salary. That being said, not a cake walk of a job.\n\nEDIT: said this in a reply further down, thought most would benefit from it.\n\n\"Isn't the main issue that it pays incredibly little, relatively speaking?\"\n\nYeah for sure. I had a lot of colleagues (especially those in the recently-graduated-but-still-unemployed demographic) that used teaching as a stepping stone in their career towards other ventures. Bursary (where applies), a salary (meagre as it is) and something to add to the resume that displays work ethic and personable skills in the interim until they find out their next play. Certainly not ideal, and definitely untraditional, but a growingly popular career path nonetheless.\n\nEDIT2: \n\n\"Good idea, tell people who never really wanted to teach, to teach. Those kids are gonna be so lucky to have someone who's there to collect a check.\"\n\nThat's a caveat I should have mentioned. As clich\u00e9 as it is, the system is broken. I'm gonna be a classroom teacher for life, I know that, but I can also sympathize for others in this thread that are looking for an answer. To their defence, those same colleagues I've had still showed up and were excellent teachers while they were there. There's demand on both sides.",

The population of London has also fallen by 10-25% since the start of the pandemic, but I wouldn\u2019t base policy on that remaining the case in six months or a year. The UK in recent years has a low unemployment rate, historically and compared to other countries, although it\u2019s difficult to work out the figures for underemployment.\n\nIn general the UK wants to be a service export economy, and those jobs are not impacted by people moving in, in fact that\u2019s more likely to strengthen a hub which attracts more business and more employers. Programmers in Silicon Valley don\u2019t lose jobs when another programmer moves there, it\u2019s the opposite.\n\nEdit: I added in the range of figures rather than the top end. It's 700k who have moved out of London, so it's 25% if those came solely from Inner London, or 10% if they came from the whole of London. Likely the former is closer to being true, because young people with fewer connection tend to live in Inner London and not far out into the suburbs.",

They painted pro Brexit people as racist nationalists who only care about themselves and used people like Tommy Robinson who would have been better off as a cum stain as an example of the type of person pro Brexit people are. \n\nIn reality they are just people with different opinions on a very complex political issue. I consider myself neutral on the matter (mostly due to distrust in the media) but most of my friends are pro Brexit and are generally really nice, tolerant and welcoming people, they have their reasons which I won\u2019t go into but it just seems people are too eager to gobble up whatever shit they are told about the group that has opposing opinions. It\u2019s really quite heartbreaking to see how easy it is to manipulate shit like this. LOOKING AT YOU THE DAILY FUCKING MAIL!",

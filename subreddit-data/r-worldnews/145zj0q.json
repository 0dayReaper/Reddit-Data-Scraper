It's the whole reason why China is desperate to solve climate change while also maintaining their growth. If they can solve it, they don't need to secure their water as desperately, and can rely on trade to secure their water (and oil); but if they don't, they need the growth to have the power to take it from Russia. China's deeply aware of their long term issues, and are clearly aware that east Russia is the cause or solution to many of them.",

Depleting your stockpile to near empty in modern warfare is problematic because you need to be able to swarm enemy air defenses with vast numbers of contacts in order to occasionally breach defenses, this is hard enough with modern missiles let alone with cannibalized scrap from the 60's that you can't get to the front in large quantities. \n\nIt's even worse for Russia because their soldiers are so inept that a large portion of russian military doctrine is to pulverize enemy defense and more often *civilian cities and infrastructure* with incredible amounts of bombs, missiles and artillery, all of which are either in short supply or cannot make it to the front fast enough in large enough quantities to matter stratigicly. The modern battlefield is an equation of saturation of equipment and trained personnel to operate it.\n\nSecondly, nobody is saying that's how it works, you're taking your own assumptions and plastering them all over everyone else and virtually every media outlet including ones run by the russian government say you're just fucking wrong and don't actually know what the fuck you're talking about. \n\nLastly, every missile russia uses is one less they have, and they can not domestically manufacture enough missiles or procure enough low quality arms from the politically unstable benefactors to meet the challenge of breaking modern air defense systems. Which means fewer apartments and schools being bombed, and less protection and support for russian ground forces. It doesn't mean an instant collapse of russian forces in Ukraine. Nobody thinks that, we're not God damn toddlers.",

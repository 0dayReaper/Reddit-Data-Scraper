(I'm a bot)\n*****\n&gt; Iran has issued an arrest warrant and asked Interpol for help in detaining US President Donald Trump and dozens of others it believes carried out the drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad. Tehran prosecutor Ali Alqasimehr said on Monday that Trump, along with more than 30 others Iran accuses of involvement in the January 3 attack that killed General Qassem Soleimani, face &amp;quot;Murder and terrorism charges&amp;quot;, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported.\n\n&gt; Alqasimehr was also quoted as saying Iran had requested a &amp;quot;Red notice&amp;quot; be put out for Trump and the others, the highest-level notice issued by Interpol, requesting that seeks the location and arrest of the individual named.\n\n&gt; It is unlikely Interpol would grant Iran&amp;#039;s request as its guideline for notices forbids it from &amp;quot;Undertaking any intervention or activities of a political&amp;quot; nature.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/hhyl3a/iran_issues_arrest_warrant_for_trump/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~502154 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Iran**^#1 **Interpol**^#2 **notice**^#3 **request**^#4 **arrest**^#5",

How can any politician be held accountable internationally if basically every crime they commit is politically motivated?  And isn't terrorism *by definition* a political act?  If taken to it's full logical conclusion, Interpol is useless because someone could argue that any arrest of a government official is political \"activity\" because politics are *inherent* in literally all international affairs.  Even arresting the Money Heist gang would be political in nature when considering WHY the state found it so damned important.",

Last time the Hague tried to try an American soldier, a judge resigned after the US threatened their families\n\nEdit 1: As someone pointed out, the US does prosecute war crimes themselves. Which means they have discretion to not. Ex. Trump pardoned a war criminal early this year and Blackwater.\n\nEdit 2: As u/BoabHonker pointed out, I confused two stories. Pompeo threatened the families of the ICC with a veiled threat and Bolton threatened the OPCW families very explicitly BUT he never *said* anything about killing.\n\nSource 1: https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/28/international-criminal-court-icc-judge-christoph-flugge-quits-citing-political-interference-trump-administration-turkey\nSource 2: https://theintercept.com/2018/03/29/john-bolton-trump-bush-bustani-kids-opcw/",

How many more gigatons per year would you need to emit in order accelerate the rate of warming in order to reach 2 \u00b0C of warming by 2030?\n\nWhile the curve is exponential, if you can answer the above question, you'll get a true sense of scale within reason. Current emissions are ~37 GtCO\u2082 per annually. \n\n***\nYou might find the following useful for your calculations:\n\n1 ppm by volume of atmosphere CO2 = 2.13 GtC or 7.875 GtCO2\n\nRCP 2.6 = 455 (430 - 480) ppm CO2 (0.9 - 2.3 \u00b0C)\n\nRCP 4.5 = 649 (580 - 720) ppm CO2 (1.7 - 3.2 \u00b0C)\n\nRCP 6.0 = 859 (720 - 1000) ppm CO2 (2.0 - 3.7 \u00b0C)\n\nRCP 8.5 = 1371 (&gt; 1000) ppm CO2 (3.2 - 5.4 \u00b0C)\n\n***\nYou can check the above using the following equation:\n\n\u2206F = 5.35 ln(C/C_0). \n\nWhere '\u2206F' is the radiative forcing in W/m^(2), 'C' is the concentration of atmospheric CO\u2082 , and 'C_0' is the reference CO2concentration. Normally the value of C_0 is chosen at the pre-industrial concentration of 280 ppmv.\n\n***\n\nA second equation is \u2206Ts / \u2206F = \u03bb where the global mean surface temperature response \u2206Ts to the radiative forcing \u2206F is \u03bb, a nearly invariant parameter typically about 0.5 K/(Wm^(\u22122)).\n\n***\n\nAs an example, using 523 CO2-eq ppm (our current atmospheric CO2-eq) for C in the first equation yields \u2206F = 5.35 ln(523/280). \n\n\u2206F = 3.34\n\n\u2234\n\n\u2206Ts = 0.5*3.34\n\n\u2206Ts = 1.67",

They don\u2019t understand that only an average is being described, bizarre weather is potentially more dangerous than overall warming.  Most crops are not tolerant of extreme weather and temperatures.  Most crops die when exposed to prolonged heat and drought.  Conversely a late season freeze will also damage or destroy crops.  Many fruit trees require a certain number of winter chill hours to produce properly, Georgia lost 90% of the peach crop this year because the winter was too warm and the trees did not get sufficient chill hours.  Vermont lost two entire counties of fruit tree and berry bush production because of a late season freeze, any crops planted likewise died or were damaged.  People don\u2019t understand that their food is being damaged in a variety of ways, they are not going to get it until there are actual shortages and then they\u2019ll scream for Solutions but there won\u2019t be any.  Food production is reliant on mother nature more or less being predictable and we\u2019re getting the exact opposite these days.  You can\u2019t irrigate your way out of a long drought and too much heat just like you can\u2019t keep millions of acres of crops and fruit trees warm during a freeze.",

Things like trying to bring down the costs of indoor farming, modifying crops to better withstand temperature swings, trying to develop the technology to synthesize edible molecules, or at least to grow things that don't need a lot of outdoor farmland like edible algae, or building up the infrastructure for things like putting aerosols in the upper atmosphere to induce volcanic winter if we decide to go that route, which I also think we should seriously consider. \nEven if we manage to largely limit the amount of warming, some negative effects are already guaranteed, and it does not hurt to be prepared.",

Just building the infrastructure to grow food indoors would generate massive pollution, cost a fortune and not make a significant contribution towards feeding people.  Oh sure you could do multiple tiers with indoor farming but The US alone has 900,000,000 acres of farmland.  A football field is about an acre.  If the US built 1 million buildings the size of a football field and those buildings magically produced 10 times as much food versus the equivalent farmland that\u2019s still only about 1% of our needs. Imagine how much money that would cost to build and our and how much pollution would be created building them.  \n\nModifying crop sounds like a great idea but most crops are not cold tolerant and if we could\u2019ve modified them we would\u2019ve.  Likewise most crops cannot survive prolonged heat waves and drought, and with climate change crops could be hit with both during the same growing cycle.  Likewise fruit trees are susceptible to heat waves frosts.  \n\nGrowing algae as a food source is one potential option, the problem will be convincing people to eat it.  Infrastructure becomes a problem just like with indoor farming, we are just talking about growing algae and we\u2019re talking about growing algae in a food safe environment so it doesn\u2019t get contaminated with other microorganisms and kill a bunch of people.  \n\nYou really went off the rails at the end, intentionally darkening the skies sounds like something a bond movie villain would do.",

It's a serious enough idea: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection\n\nAdmittedly as far as geoengineering concepts go it has more negative side effects than most, but as far as I understand it's also the only one we really have a reasonable chance of being able to afford. It could potentially even be done by a sufficiently well off country alone if they really wanted to, though I imagine trying to intentionally modify the global climate without international agreement would have diplomatic ramifications",

I'll agree it's not really a great solution, it doesn't fix the whole problem, only the temperature, and it has to be continuously maintained once started until the excess greenhouse gases one is trying to counter are removed from the atmosphere, and obviously has pollution concerns from whatever you're adding, but if the consequences of increased temperatures are worse than the consequences of the project, it's a potential quick bandaid solution that can be applied until such time as we can sequester the carbon out of the air or something",

Did you expect that 10 years worth of solar panels and electric cars just starting to become viable was gonna magically erase the centuries of damage we\u2019ve done to and still are doing to our environment in order to allow humans to develop to the standard of living we have now?\n\n&gt;You're in the bargaining phase. By all means, throw some solar panels on the roof and go vegan, it's still better to try, but at the same time the likelihood that humanity does enough, in time, to avoid catastrophic disruption to the climate is vanishing small.\n\nI\u2019m sure it makes you feel better to believe that people with actual solutions to this problem are in the \u201cbargaining phases\u201d but your doomer mentality is just as destructive as climate change deniers. Instead we need a realistic approach can lead to a sustainable path for human growth. The evidence is clear that doing this would help to ameliorate this problem. Will our climate go back to pre-industrial levels? No. But that doesn\u2019t mean that human civilization is done for-the evidence that we are fucked already is just not there. Ask any scientist who studies this. Most-whether optimistic or pessimistic acknowledge the effectiveness of green energy, sustainable resources, and less meat (lab grown could substitute) on the environment. The only thing they are skeptical of is carbon capture and even that is gaining increasing acceptance. Most climate models that provide a pathway to the future incorporate some form of fossil fuel removal from the atmosphere and/or ocean (various methods exist). \n\n&gt; So like I said, not having kids is the ethical thing to do because we know with a high degree of certainty that theworld they are born into will unravel during their lifetime, with the mountains of suffering that will entail.\n\nHumanity has had kids through WAY worse than this. You are operating off of a borderline apocalyptic cult like mentality-not a scientific one. Again-scientists have been working on this problem for decades now and they do not endorse this form of destructive doomerism any more than they endorse outright climate change denialism.",

There is no mention of 1.5\u00b0C being the end of the cliff or that being the only choice. (Though yes, naturally all the other explored scenarios and their consequences in the report paint a somewhat \"bleaker\" future.)\n\nWhat I *do* find are \"Long-term mitigation pathways\" to keep the temperature under 2\u00b0C and what do to do reach them.\n https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf\n\nPerhaps your Information from the time was somewhat selective and influenced from some news articles or opinion pieces at the time? I get it, it is very time consuming to read primary sources. But I don't see how the IPCC did really do what you claim they did.",

From a cursory read at least, what this says is that 1.5 is substantially better than 2.0 from a ecological and human suffering pov, which the last report also says. This also says that some ecosystems will be permanently damaged, pointing out that some regions will experience more extreme changes than others.\n\nDo you have reason to doubt any specific statements? Is it the numbers 1.5 and 2.0?",

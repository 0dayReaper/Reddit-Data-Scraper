The trucks to haul the machines to the factories were either made in China or with parts from China. \n\nAfter all that, when you start making something at this new factory you set up, chances are the raw materials are being transported via China or packaged in China. \n\nWe made this massive industrial machine in China that streamlined everything through one place, and it would be nearly impossible to divert it now.",

Also the logistics of transporting 500,000 troops like north Korea asserted they'd send over or even 5000 troops is pretty monumental and takes months of training and equipping and then sending out to the front lines.\n\nAlso I don't doubt that north Korea has the manpower to send out men, but whether or not Russia wants them is a different story. There are already a lot of big heads directing troops in Ukraine and I doubt putin wants more big headed military guys trying to look good on the field for prestige and rank. Look at the rivalries that have formed between people like prighozine of wagner and gerasimov who is the commander of the actual Russian forces in Ukraine. They hate each other",

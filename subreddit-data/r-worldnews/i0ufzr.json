There will be a heightened awareness so any sort of deterrent will play a much larger role in the grand scheme of things. Something that may have not been as important last year now may be enough for someone not to go entirely. There\u2019s so much less incentive to travel like that now.\n\nEdit: I totally understand that by then there will almost certainly be a vaccine. The point I\u2019m making is that a place like Qatar, which I\u2019ve never heard of being a tourist destination in the past, will be a trivial place to travel to after this pandemic. If you\u2019re going to an event like the WC you know people from all over the planet are going to be there, and that the potential for some sort of outbreak or calamity will be high \u2014 people will in turn start to enjoy being able to do the touristy things near them again, as they weren\u2019t able to enjoy them for nearly a year if not longer.",

But then the IOC came with their demands, which we told them to stick up their asses. \n\nThe ESC, however, is a punishment. Since the next competition happens in the country of whoever wins, anyone could end up hosting. Competing doesn't cost much, but hosting is really really expensive. Not to mention you only have 1 year to do it. Thus, nations have refused to host after winning. \n\nThe UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy also pay a lot of the bill, so they get to go straight to the final. Which is more of a punishment for the UK, as they suck and keep coming in dead last. The others usually do quite well.",

The soviet empire invited many journalists to Russia to write magazine and news articles about them that sounded pretty rosy, and even then we knew they had concentration camps, we just called them \"gulags\".  I don't think there has been an oppressive regime that didn't at least partially get away with it, until a massacre happened or a war, and even then the world sometimes turns a blind eye to it.  What China is doing is pretty bad, but not unheard of in recent history, things like this have happened before, I'm just not sure if it comes to war with China.",

Time also always stresses that it awards the cover image to people who make the largest impact on world events, not necissarily the *best* impact; for a recent example of this, Kim Jong Un was in contention for the time person of the year award very recently\n\nThis was also 5 years prior to the organized slaughter of Jews, which we have the first evidence of occurring in 1941, so the image Time had of him might have been significantly more rosy because the terrible things we associate with Hitler in retrospect simply didn't happen yet for it to taint the contemporary world's image of him. At the time, british appeasment policies were still the favored response to Hitler's aggression, so at the time the contemporary perspective of hitler was a ruffian who started border skirmishes, not as a genocidal maniac we know him to be today.\n\nI completely agree with you when you said that we tend to develop unjustifiably complacent attitudes towards authoritarian regimes when they are our contemporaries, but its equally important not to contort context or leave it out of the argument when finding evidence to support our viewpoints. I just wanted to add the context to the Hitler's feature on the time cover for the first time in 1936. Historical accuracy is important\n\nedit: i originally confused hitler's time person of the year award, awarded to him in 1939 for his actions in 1938, with the first time he was featured on the time magazine cover in 1936:\n\n [http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19360413,00.html](http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19360413,00.html) \n\nOriginal comment has been edited to reflect the change",

It doesn't matter that you could get cheaper labor force in poland or what have you if you're not yet located there in any meaningful way. And between all those slaves...uhm cheap workers there is also chinese staff that is mandatory for the operations. \n\nSlowly but surely companies are reallocating their factories but that will take ages. It's still by far the most important factor as to why we deal with china and mostly overlook the shit they do. \n\nMy guess is sooner or later china will start relying on their own stuff anyway and companies know this. Whether they want or not, that market isn't going to stay. China still relies on us/eu just as much as we do on them and they certainly don't want to keep it that way.\n\nFunny enough sooner or later we wont be able to financially punish china at all anymore but culturally we will. If they were to lose the 2022 games that would actually be impactful. Excluding them from the cultural exchange such as olympic games, worldcups etc. is more a feasible way to discipline them, in a way.",

We\u2019ve tried moving factories to Vietnam and Pakistan and the cost and time it takes to get goods to port was dreadful. China is efficient and make arguably high quality goods. Most people don\u2019t understand that some of the best quality goods come out of China. It\u2019s the brands and corner cutting companies that direct Chinese factories to make the cheap shit.",

Today, it is the main face and voice of a separatist operation dedicated to destabilising the Xinjiang region of China and ultimately toppling the Chinese government.\n\n&gt;While seeking to orchestrate a colour revolution with the aim of regime change in Beijing, the WUC and its offshoots have forged ties with the Grey Wolves, a far-right Turkish organisation that has been actively engaged in sectarian violence from Syria to East Asia.\n\n&gt;None of these links seem to have troubled the WUC\u2019s sponsors in Washington. If anything, they have added to the network\u2019s appeal, consolidating it as one of the most potent political weapons the US wields in its new Cold War against China.\n\n&gt;From its inception, the WUC has been backed by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). With millions in US taxpayer money, the NED and its subsidiaries have backed opposition parties, \u201ccivil society\u201d groups, and media organisations in countries targeted by the US for regime change.\n\n&gt;Philip Agee, the late CIA whistleblower, described the work of the NED as a more sophisticated version of the old-fashioned covert operations that Langley used to engineer. \u201cNowadays,\u201d Agee explained, \u201cinstead of having the CIA going around behind the scenes and trying to manipulate the process by inserting money here and giving instructions secretly and so forth, they have now a sidekick, which is this National Endowment for Democracy, NED.\u201d",

Many of which were also, famously, involved in producing anti-soviet propaganda during the cold War, as well as the information \"proving\" Iraq had WMDs in the leadup to the invasion or Iraq, and most recently the now debunked information accusing Morales of cheating in the election in Bolivia in order to justify regime change.\n\nI don't want to say it's *all* fake, but I pretty much couldn't think of a less trustworthy source. And seeing those sources of information make it to the front page and then all the top comments call for open war with China..... it just paints a bad picture. Reeks of public manipulation. Something anyone thats been alive for more than 5 minutes knows the government is not hesitant to do.",

[...]\n\n&gt;In a February 2011 interview with The Guardian he \"admitted for the first time that he lied about his story, then watched in shock as it was used to justify the war.\"\n\nAs a German, we should have kicked this guy out and revoked his asylum in my opinion. He is literally partially responsible for the Iraq War and the death of hundreds of thousands of people, all because he made up stories about Iraq and basically played right into the US' hands, and they certainly were not shy about using him for their propaganda purposes. And frankly, it's quite shocking how much of these reports that are currently coming out are based on organisations or individuals that have ties to the US government and are mirroring almost exactly what we went through in 2003.",

Anyone, especially foreign governments, can invent organizations and release \u201creports\u201d that look legitimate on the surface, but collapse under scrutiny. \n\nHell, one of the biggest recent China-related AMA\u2019s has come from a purported \u201cUyghur Concentration Camp Escapee\u201d, but five minutes of research showed that she was literally an employee of the CIA. For a site that prides itself on being a more intellectual part of the internet, people here lack basic critical thinking skills.\n\nAnd before anyone accuses me of being a Chinese shill, I assure that I am not. I am an American who recognizes that the United States has a vested interest in making China out to be a boogeyman so that a new Cold War will have public support. I don\u2019t support all of China\u2019s actions, by any stretch. I don\u2019t support incarceration of Uyghurs based on their ethnic group (though it\u2019s worth mentioning that much of the prisoner population are returning Jihadists, or those detected to be budding Jihadists). But by all accounts there is *none* of the Nazi-esque activity going on in the camps that reddit wants so desperately to be happening.\n\nI\u2019ll leave this with one thing: there are 25,000+ mosques in Xinjiang, by far the most of any Chinese province, more are being built every year. And the Uyghur minority was *exempt* from many of the family planning restrictions placed on the Han majority. Really sounds like a cultural genocide to me /s",

This is because dirty coal produces sulfates which cloud the atmosphere and act as a sunscreen. This sunscreen has prevented the level of warming we **should** have seen by now, but have avoided (kinda, keep reading). [Here\u2019s good example of this on a smaller scale:]( https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610007/were-about-to-kill-a-massive-accidental-experiment-in-halting-global-warming/)\n&gt;In effect, the shipping industry has been carrying out an unintentional experiment in climate engineering for more than a century. Global mean temperatures could be as much as 0.25 \u02daC lower than they would otherwise have been, based on the mean \u201cforcing effect\u201d \n\n * much has been done in the way of researching the extent of this (Aerosol Masking/Global Dimming)effect. Currently it is understood that [Anthropogenic aerosols have already brought about a decrease of \u223c2.53 K, Experiments based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 given in IPCC AR5 shows the dramatic decrease in three anthropogenic aerosols in 2100 will lead to an increase of \u223c2.06 K]( https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.4613)\n\n\n * That's not to say that we have **truly** avoided this warming. We simply kick the can down the road with these emissions. The warming is still there waiting, until the moment we no longer emit these sulfates. * [Just 35% reduction in industrial output(emissions) would lead to 1C temperature rise](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jgrd.50192). Depending on which scientist you ask, it could be as little as a week, or it could be up to 6 weeks. Regardless though, the warming is still there on the horizon. \n\n * Worse though, [It's been recently discovered this effect is actually more potent than we previously had estimated](https://m.phys.org/news/2019-01-cooling-effect-aerosols-cumulus-msc.html?fbclid=IwAR1AyPkeQ2JlWu5bs1r6uwGlBrOciNWlJ9t57XMQ3KlGMQBun7JPLfh2r-g). By more than twice as much.\n\nThis all amounts to bad news because [Nature: 2C temperatures exponentially increase likelihood of ice free summers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0127-8.epdf?referrer_access_token=8oMBjRrFiX64Z1Haei6z3tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NRyZNTJX4vdDMHJ4-rPouf-Sdg3u4otuwTt1cOuayIj_x06Bw2-9DHnjuBzuPpd79MF7QfGGRaqRHyVC-1ba8kkfj1zHLW-71cFmlnipiab_WK4D8DyjEYD-qvye07IGDAbFWOhkTtnfg5SjmK51p0WvZgTR40c81IApKz1J9tYvQsgTiOkdUh0LqKFv64L3zLFJ1j_qJRSgM8ryq7olwZ&amp;tracking_referrer=mashable.com) and the [Head of Polar Ocean Physics Group at Cambridge says IPCC grossly underestimates blue ocean event frequency and timeline](https://streamable.com/s7mvo).\n\nWe, and all vertibrate species are reliant entirely on eachother and others in a way that is rapidly being threatened as seen in a recent-ish paper [\"Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines\"](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/30/E6089) from Ehrlich et. al. as well as [\"Co-extinctions annihilate planetary life during extreme environmental change\"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35068-1) from Giovanni Strona &amp; Corey J. A. Bradshaw. Furthermore, there are limits to adaptation. \n\nWe can only adapt so far. 5C global average temperature rise is our absolute survivable wet bulb threshold. This is illustrated in [\"An adaptability limit to climate change due to heat stress\"\"](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/21/9552) from Steven C. Sherwood and Matthew Huber \n\nWhat this culminates to is a clear disconnect in what is understood in the literature and what is being described as a timeline by various sources. How can one assume we can continue on this path until 2030,2050,2100? How could this possibly be? We are on an unstable trajectory and **we need to act *now* or our children and us alike will suffer.**",

Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets the regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in tax](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)) and allows for a higher carbon price (which [is what matters for climate mitigation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S201000781840002X)) because [the public isn't willing to pay anywhere near what's needed otherwise](http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/Is-the-Public-Willing-to-Pay-to-Help-Fix-Climate-Change-.aspx). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own.\n\n[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)).\n\nTaxing carbon [is in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf), and [many nations have already started](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29687/9781464812927.pdf?sequence=5&amp;isAllowed=y). We [won\u2019t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG). Each year we delay costs [~$900 billion](https://cla.umn.edu/heller-hurwicz/news-events/news/policy-brief-calibrating-price-climate-risk).\n \n[It's the smart thing to do](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069698910580). And the IPCC report made clear [pricing carbon is **necessary** if we want to meet our 1.5 \u00baC target](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf).\n\n[The U.S. could induce other nations to enact mitigation policies by enacting one of our own](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). Contrary to [popular belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) the main barrier isn't lack of public support; in fact, a majority in [every congressional district](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/?est=reducetax&amp;type=value&amp;geo=cd) and [each political party](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf) supports a carbon tax, which [does help our chances of passing meaningful legislation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2016.1116651). But [we can't keep hoping others will solve this problem for us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility). *[We](https://i.redd.it/tomv8cnadxa11.jpg)* need to take the necessary steps to make this dream a reality:\n\n[**Lobby**](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-CarbonTax&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=CarbonTax).

[Ch. 15](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should. There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf).

People can be quite calm about the inevitable, especially if they truly believe there's nothing they can do about it.    Death itself is that way.  We all are pretty sure that we'll eventually die, that it's natural, and that there's nothing we can do to prevent it,  but we don't spend our lives in a straight up panic.\n\nI'm not saying I agree that the climate change we've been seeing is natural, or that extinction of our species is inevitable, I certainly don't.

Just as your nose stops smelling something if you are around it long enough, people hear about how the end is nigh *all the time* while not really being given a lot of examples about what they can do about it. Not everyone has the money for a solar roof or electric car, not everyone can just move closer to work, not everyone has a yard they can plant trees in. Many people, especially in much of the US, are just trying to get by day to day, and don't have much of a *choice* about climate change - but they're told every single day, the world is ending, and it's their fault.  \n\nAnd it's only going to get worse, as the environment gets worse.",

But here's why its the most sinister, as much as i support individual acts because movements need to start somehwhere, the real climate impact wont come to pass until cooporations are heavily regulated for climate purposes, and sadly, for us americans at least, the power of lobbying will let these big com,panies doing most of the damage continue to do so until the problem is so much worse.

            "comment": "I've posted this before, but it needs to be seen as much as possible. Additionally, I don't write this to be a defeatist, but rather to draw attention to our very real problems: \n\nClimate change and the degradation of the natural world are going to be **humanity's existential crisis**\n\n[If we stopped all emissions today, the planet would warm for at LEAST a century, and very likely closer to scales of millenia](http://theconversation.com/if-we-stopped-emitting-greenhouse-gases-right-now-would-we-stop-climate-change-78882). CO2 lasts for hundreds of years in the atmosphere, and then only goes into other forms of the carbon cycle slowly over thousands of years (or never).  \n\nFirstly, there is a [delay in air temperature increase.](https://skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html) This means that the carbon already emitted will take 40 years to reach its full potential. This is largely due to the slow process of Earth's oceans warming. In many ways, we're feeling the emissions of the 80's right now.  \n\nThere are feedback loops. As the planet warms, the oceans cannot absorb as much CO2. [Methane](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-bad-of-a-greenhouse-gas-is-methane/), which works on scales of hundreds of years instead of thousands(but is much more effective at heating), will be released more and more on large swaths of land as time goes on. \n\nOther feedback loops include deforestation and albedo effects, [melting ice caps](https://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/more-resources-on-climate-change/climate-change-lines-of-evidence-booklet/evidence-impacts-and-choices-figure-gallery/figure-9/), and [increasing water vapor](https://phys.org/news/2014-07-vapor-global-amplifier.html) which will only amplify the damage that has already been done.\n\nThink about that: If we did the impossible and switched entirely to 100%, zero-emission, fictional renewables today and provided zero carbon footprint... We'd *still be in dire conditions for generations to come.*\n\nFrom a wildlife standpoint - even more grim news.\nEvery animal on the planet is dropping.  [Recent studies](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37775622) estimate 58% of all wildlife has died since 1970. The U.N. has warned [1 million species are at risk of extinction](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/05/ipbes-un-biodiversity-report-warns-one-million-species-at-risk/).  We are in an extinction event that is [*ten to one-hundred times*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction) the rate of any other extinction on Earth, save the giant impact event.  It seems like hyperbole, but it isn't.  We are currently undergoing (at least) the second-fastest extinction in the planet's history.\n\nClimate-deniers like to call people like me who agree with the global consensus of scientists \"alarmists.\" You're fucking right I'm an alarmist. This is our planet and our livelihoods at stake.",

However, there is a way to treat this. Using Pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS), which uses black carbon/charcoal, plants are farmed, pyrolyzed into black carbon, and buried. This form is less susceptible to decomposition and, when buried, provides long-term carbon storage.\n\nOf course, what is much more feasible, and has been shown to work, is to remove it from the source itself. Putting chemical scrubbers onto the exhaust pipes and places with signifcant CO\u2082 production, would be much more sensible and effective.",

Millions of acres of previously cleared farmland in the southern US are now back to being tree farms, primarily loblolly pine. \"Bottomlands\" or the areas near streams that are not suitable for tree cultivation provide additional biomass and crucial forest diversity.  Add in designated wildnerness areas that were previously stripped clean of trees but have since been allowed to regrow as natural successional forest, and you have additional biodiversity as well as wildlife refuges.\n\nAs a result of this, the southern US is one of the few places on the planet that have been *reforested* over the last few decades.  A mixture of managed forests and wilderness has allowed the unused land in the states to become a giant carbon sink.",

I have seen a forest get stripped down to dirt replaced with new pine trees and be fully regrown in my lifetime. I'm only 26. You would be surprised at how quickly a forest can be rebuilt. loblolly pine can reach maturity in as little as 15 years, which then provides shade for hardwood saplings to grow as the lack of sunlight kills off underbrush that chokes out those saplings. Plant the trees people.",

The company producing them also sells the captured CO2 for things such as carbonation, they don't keep it out of the atmosphere. It's certainly better for those industries to source their CO2 in a more carbon neutral way but such industrial uses of CO2 actually in products is incredibly minuscule compared to power generation, transportation, and agriculture.",

Fwiw, a lot of people are hard at work to at least come up with solutions that are feasible, and that's getting better all the time.  The question lies in whether enough people start taking it seriously anytime soon, and start being willing to pay the price to start fixing this.  The biggest obstacle is absolutely not the tech, but the people who are stubbornly refusing to even allow progress on this.",

And besides, this all sounds very expensive and something something jobs something economy. \"\n\n\nFundamentally this is why people aren't engaging on this issue. Cause and effect is abstract. You can't go outside, point to something, and say \"that's global warming.\" It's not an experience for them, it's statistics. Statistics aren't very convincing on their own.\n\n\nBut you've touched on the other half of the problem. Namely that we don't have a solution. There's no one thing we can do to put a check next to this. What we have is a huge, huge list of things that are varying in terms of impact, cost, and likelihood of success. There is no quick fix. \n\n\nPolitically, there's no will to act because of this one-two punch of lack of emotional connection to the problem and the complexity of the problem defying a single solution. Global climate change activists almost always quote statistics and scenarios while denialists \"confuse\" weather and climate. The disconnect isn't understanding what it is, but rather how to relate it to their daily lives.\n\n\nIf you want people to take this seriously you need to bring it home. Post pictures showing how much trash a single person generates. How much space it takes up. Show them how many trees they need to meet the oxygen requirements for them, and then show how many modern living needs. How many tons of earth get dug up to make their car, computer, home, and workspace. Basically show them the deficit -- that they're taking more than is being put back. Those are examples people can relate to.\n\n\nThe only argument I've found effective is appealing to people's sense of fairness. If I give everyone a dollar that's fair. If I give you a thousand dollars and everyone else one dollar most people are going to ask why and be upset it wasn't them that got it. Environmental impact is about fairness. It's fundamentally about protecting a shared (and currently rapidly diminishing) resource. \n\n\nWe need to change how we're presenting this crisis to people who aren't convinced or who are but balk at the cost. Japan recycles over 90% of what they generate and their cities and infrastructure is more modern than ours. We can certainly have modern living while greatly diminishing our impact to the environment.",

Look at the example of lifestyle choices that will - with some high degree of probability - lead to a bad outcome *for that individual* later on in life; smoking, lack of exercise, poor diet etc. People in general find it very hard to motivate themselves in the now for payback in the future. This is made even worse by the fact that, on an individual level, it feels as if there is very little impact we can make to the outcome and, as you say, the results of that action are so ill defined. This is exactly the sort of situation that demands that adults in the room (the government) stands up and demands appropriate action but I must admit I am extremely pessimistic about that chances of that happening.",

They normally detect the electrical impulses from fish coming towards them and swim away, but with the acidified environment they would turn *toward* the stimulus and... well you can guess what happens from there...\n\nWe really shouldn\u2019t fuck with Mother Nature like this.",

I took the plunge after reading [this article](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/lobbying-for-the-greater-good/) a few years ago, and here are some things I've done so far:\n\n* I've talked with friends and family about a [carbon tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price). I've convinced several that a carbon tax is a good idea. I've convinced a few to start volunteering for carbon taxes. [34% of Americans would be willing to volunteer for an organization to convince elected officials to act on climate change](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). If you feel like you're up against a wall in your own political conversations, [here's some short trainings on how to have better political conversations](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/how-to-have-better-political-conversations/). \n\n* It took a few tries, but I published [a Letter to the Editor](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/111) to the largest local paper in my area espousing the need for and benefits of a carbon tax. Maybe you don't read LTEs, but [Congress does](https://www.aclu.org/other/letters-editor-how-write-them-and-why-they-work). \n\n* I wrote to [my favorite podcast](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) about carbon taxes asking them to talk about [the scientific](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economic](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) consensus on their show. When nothing happened, I asked some fellow listeners to write, too. Eventually [they released this episode](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/573) (and [this blog post](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/economics-renewables-and-climate-change/)) lauding the benefits of carbon taxes.  \n\n* I've written literally dozens of [letters to my Rep and Senators](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/write-your-representative/) over the last few years asking them to support Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend. I've seen their responses change over the years, too, so I suspect it's working (in fairness, [I'm not the only one](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/accomplishments/), of course). [Over 90% of members of Congress are swayed by contact from constituents](http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/communicating-with-congress/citizen-centric-advocacy-2017). \n\n* I've hosted or co-hosted 4 letter-writing parties so that I could invite people I know to take [meaningful and effective action](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) on climate change.\n\n* At my request, 5 businesses and 2 non-profits have signed [Influencer's Letters to Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/leaders/) calling for Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend. \n\n* I recruited a friend to help me write a municipal Resolution for our municipality to publicly support Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend. It took a lot of hard work recruiting volunteers from all over the city, sometimes meeting 2-3 times with the same Council member, but eventually it passed unanimously. [Over 100 municipalities have passed similar Resolutions in support of Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend that call on Congress to pass the legislation](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/endorsements/municipal/). \n\n* I started a Meetup in my area to help recruit and train more volunteers who are interested in making this dream a reality. The group now has hundreds of members. I've invited on several new co-leaders who are doing pretty much all the work at this point. \n\n* I gave two [presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/159) to groups of ~20 or so on Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend and why it's a good idea that we should all be advocating for. I [arranged these presentations](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/160) myself. \n\n* I co-hosted two screenings of [Season 2, Episode 7 of Years of Living Dangerously \"Safe Passage\"](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/take-action/host-a-screening/#1485986882331-9e38cb79-9c5e1492-21fb7dd6-03b9bd85-3e3cce1f-2786706c-ee83)\n\n* I attended two meetings in my Representatives' home office to discuss Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend and try to get their support. \n\nI know some of these things seem small, but it may be that at least some of them are having an impact; [just five years ago, only 30% of Americans supported a carbon tax](http://closup.umich.edu/issues-in-energy-and-environmental-policy/13/public-views-on-a-carbon-tax-depend-on-the-proposed-use-of-revenue/). Today, [it's over half](https://news.gallup.com/poll/232007/americans-want-government-more-environment.aspx). If you think Congress doesn't care about public support, have a look at [the evidence](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2016.1116651).\n\n[Lobbying works](https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/friends_or_foes-how_social_movement_allies_affect_the_passage_of_legislation_in_the_u._s._congress.pdf), and [anyone can do it](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-CarbonTax&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=CarbonTax).",

But many people literally can't make these choices, in fact, most people can't. Many people have little choice in the food that they buy. They take public transportation (which is greener than electric vehicles). They don't fly because they can't. It universalizes the experience of a consumer to be that of a middle-class American. These \"solutions\" are ineffective and only bolster those that have cause climate change.\n\nThe only way to really stop it is to pressure governments and heavily regulate large corporations, especially those that are responsible for most of the CO2 in the atmosphere.",

I have been organising strikes for half a year now and this is one of the biggest public misconceptions of climate crisis:\n\n\u201eI\u2019m terrified, but what can I do?\u201c, many here are asking. The answer: A lot. But not the way they tell you. \n\nI mean, obviously: stop using plastic straws won\u2018t make it. \nHowever, even if you live car-free, eat a plant-based diet and choose trains over flights: This is not enough.\n\nYou can cut an estimated 1/3 of your emissions by individual action. The rest of it is structural. Public infrastructure, the food system, international trade and transportation is nothing you can change at an individual level. \nAdditionally, 71% of emissions are emitted by the 100 most polluting companys. You can\u2018t change them by individual action either.\n\nIt is a system that is wrong. And it\u2018s biggest success has been to make you believe that there\u2018s only YOU to blame. \n\nBut as we race to reduce our carbon footprint by individual action, they are making sure that this is a race we\u2018ll never win. They - big oil companies &amp; the rest of the fossil fuel industry - have an enormous amount of influence in our governments. Not only the Trump administration is highly corrupted - for example, in Switzerland, our biggest party\u2019s president is also president of the biggest oil-lobby group. \n\nThe scientific consensus is clear: climate emergency has become of such a dramatic scale that only radical and immediate action from our governments can prevent the worst. \n\nInstead, politicians talk about everlasting growth and distract the public with minor or made-up issues (Muslims will be the death of western civilisation!). \n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear: They have failed us. They will fail us again. They won\u2018t protect us from climate breakdown. \n\nWell, here comes what you can do: Get your ass up. Read into what the amazing activists of The Sunrise Movement, FridayForFuture, Extinction Rebellion etc. are doing. \nSupport them. \nJoin them. \nTell the truth and rebel for life.",

            "comment": "ETA 2: reformatting, sorry everyone it looked normal on mobile! \n\nETA: climate change is really scary and overwhelming. Telling people that making small changes does nothing is counterproductive. No one thinks that not using a single straw will save the world, the point is to offer a way for people to take small steps in the right direction, which soon empowers us to take bigger and bigger steps because we see it\u2019s not so hard. If you\u2019d rather everyone give up, sure, keep posting about those 100 companies making all those emissions (even though emissions aren\u2019t the only problem). If you want to make a positive difference in the world, encourage others to do something to help. If everyone does some of these, it will make a tangible difference. \n\nI wrote this in a sub thread but I\u2019m making it its own comment. Please suggest any additional ideas you have, I\u2019ll edit and add them (as well as any others I think of)! \n\nHere are some things you can do personally to help the environment: \n\n1) one of the most important things you can do is VOTE! Vote for people who care about the environment, and get your friends to do so too. \n\n2) donate money to research, climate change initiatives, wildlife funds, and girls\u2019 education\n\n3) yes, get an degree in ecology/sustainability/environmental engineering/wildlife biology (and I\u2019m happy to answer any questions about wildlife biology specifically\u2014it\u2019s so important so I gotta plug it!) \n\n4) LOBBY! [Here\u2019s](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-CarbonTax&amp;utm_campaign=CarbonTax&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) one place to start, happy to add links to others if people want to share some! \n\nThings you and anyone can do that are on a smaller scale (which will have a greater impact if you tell others about it and encourage them to do these too): \n\n1) eat less meat. Specifically less red meat. Same goes for other animal products. You don\u2019t need to go full on vegan, but reduction is important. And there are a ton of really good meat and dairy substitutes now\u2014I personally highly recommend Gardein (in the frozen section), as well as beyond meat and impossible burgers. Ripple milk is also great! \n\n1a) following that, if you do still eat meat, dont eat free range. Takes up way more land and water. Backyard chickens are fine \n\n2) keep your cats inside, and bring feral cats to the shelter. They\u2019re invasive species and responsible for 63 extinctions and counting. TNR doesn\u2019t work. \n\n3) choose walking, biking, and public transportation over driving \n\n4) reduce, reuse, THEN recycle. We need to buy fewer things (especially electronics). A lot of things can be bought as reusables, including batteries\u2014check those out!\n\n5) ethical ecotourism (and no cruises!)\n\n6) compost \n\n7) support GMOs, most are specifically  engineered to be more efficient \n\n8) plant only native plants, and get rid of non-native plants. This will help pollinators, and bonus is it\u2019s way easier to maintain! Also consider building bee houses if you have room. \n\n9) buy less single use plastic. Recycling is like a bandaid on an enormous dam about to burst\u2014it\u2019s really not doing much but it\u2019s better than nothing. \n\n10) call out companies and businesses that do shitty things on social media and via call centers. This includes using unsustainable ingredients, not recycling, using ridiculous amounts of plastic, etc \n\n11) don\u2019t litter (and cigarette butts are plastic litter), which should be obvious \n\n12) only adopt domesticated animals as pets (I\u2019m counting mice and rats and guinea pigs as domesticated jsuk), and if you want an exotic only rescue them. The illegal wildlife trade is the third largest black market in the world, and is destroying wild populations of animals. Even if your specific pet is from a captive breeder (spoiler alert, still a good possibility it was wild caught or is otherwise unsustainable), people will see pics of it online and want one, and may not be as responsible. Furthermore, don\u2019t support \u201ccute\u201d vids of people playing with wild animal pets online. Every wild animal, and especially the ones that are cool \u201cpets\u201d, fill an important role in their ecosystem, and all of these things just further encourage poaching. Happy to talk more about this point as it\u2019s more of my specialty (I\u2019m a wildlife biologist, specifically primatologist). \n\n13) don\u2019t buy essential oils, they require huge amounts of water and plants to create. Also, many popular scents are actually endangered species (see #14)\n\n14) don\u2019t buy anything made from tropical hardwoods! Before purchasing anything made of wood, look into the sustainability of it. Rosewood is the #1 most trafficked species in the world, it\u2019s used for furniture, tchotchkes, essential oils, etc, and it\u2019s endangered and plays a very important role in forests (for example, some populations of red ruffed lemurs will only build nests in rosewood trees!). The darker the wood, the longer it took to grow, so while sellers might tell you they replant any trees they cut, please know that it takes centuries to regrow these trees and so they cannot be harvested sustainably. In addition to rosewood, see ebony, Purple Heart juniper, sandalwood, teak, etc. \n\n15) try and buy clothes and other fabric goods made from natural sources. Many (including the very popular microfiber) release microplastic fibers into water sources with every wash. Cotton takes a ton of water to grow, so consider hemp and linen.\n\n16) see if your energy company has green options. Mine lets me donate a percentage of my bill to solar and wind power farms. Check out u/Atom_Blue\u2019s comment on atomic power!\n\n17) while in general reusing is better, look into the efficiency of your products. Upgrading to a newer and more efficient AC unit for example is one of the biggest things you can do to lower your carbon footprint! Also look into low flow appliances and faucets. \n\n18) be skeptical of things that seem better because they\u2019re \u201cmore natural\u201d. For example, wood is not an efficient or environmentally friendly fuel source. Like I said above, essential oils are also garbage. And \u201corganic\u201d doesn\u2019t mean no pesticides, it means no NEW pesticides\u2014aka, organic veggies require more land and more pesticides than non-organic, because the newer pesticides work so well. And be aware of trade offs\u2014sure, glass is better than plastic with regards to waste...but a) glass is expensive to recycle so a lot of places aren\u2019t doing it anymore, and b) glass products are heavier, and so shipping them requires more fuel. I personally choose glass when I know I\u2019ll reuse the item. \n\n19) buy secondhand. You can get so many great things basically or actually brand new, and for so much cheaper! I got my purse secondhand, it was half the price and was never used\u2014still had the tags on it.\n\n20) have non-recyclable plastic you just don\u2019t know what to do with? Before tossing it, try [ecobricks](https://www.ecobricks.org)! You can use them yourself (I\u2019m gonna make a foot rest when I have enough), or find a drop off location. You can also suggest projects like building park benches to your local girl/boy scouts or similar organizations.\n\n21) have fewer children, and adopt.\n\n22) wear reef safe sunscreen, even if you don\u2019t think there are any reefs around. Zinc oxide is the active ingredient you want to look for! \n\n23) volunteer for cleanups! \n\n24) Get a bidet attachment so that you use less toilet paper, and/or use recycled toilet paper\n\n25) cut up old clothes into rags, and use those to clean up instead of paper towels \n\n26) turn off all lights and anything plugged in when you leave a room! Power strips make this easy.\n\n27) try to stop using k-cups, it\u2019s so much plastic! Look into getting reusable k-cups. \n\n28) swap out dryer sheets for reusable alternatives like wool balls",

But those solar panels are apparently the breaking point. \n\nAnd in my neighborhood a guy put panels on his garage, not even enough to run the fridge, lights and garage door, and within a week was fined for not having the proper permits and told to take them down. Same with wind turbines. My house is on a lake and has a steady breeze most of the year, I could probably save a few bucks every year by installing a couple small wind generators. But they're pretty much impossible to get permits for in my area. Want to build a 10,000 sq foot mansion with a heated 6 car garage, that's no problem at all. Want to pave over your entire yard? OK, go ahead. But a 10 foot spinny boy is unacceptable!",

They would probably all be relieved by someone else coming in winding down the SMO and consolidating their gains. \n\nWhat you were probably thinking about is the Siloviki, folks like Patrushev or Bortnikov, with KGB/Chekist connections; the \"old money\" faction of the police/intelligence complex. That is where Prigozhin will run into trouble. Men with equal or greater professional experience with violence hundreds of thousands of of state security forces of various flavors and a distinct dislike for the fact that he is a outsider, a crass critic of the institution, and by some accounts a queer and a literal whore.",

The story goes that while in prison, Prigozhin was a bottom rather than a top. \n\nSome of the stories stop there. Some go further. The next tranche is that (worse in the eyes of the Russian establishment) he didn't necessarily need to be raped but would directly trade sexual favors for goods and services. \n\nThe farthest out assertions I have seen is A: it seemed like he might've even enjoyed his work and/or B: that he actually carved himself out a small power-base among the lower/lowest rungs of prison society by trading favours of that sort until he became a more general sort fixer/broker....",

The question is in what form will that take and will wagner group respect him enough to listen. My gut tells they will, but to what degree and when they're being killed in a civil war will that hold up. Can Russia even commit forces to fight a third army?\n\nEdited to add: This feels a bit like a move of desperation by the MoD imo, they need wagner on the frontlines but Prigozhin is probably refusing without more resources and Russia needs people on the frontline badly. Not to mention that if Wagner becomes the largest military force in Russia...uh oh.",

Despite the Defence Ministry's directive for all \"volunteer detachments\" to sign contracts with the ministry by the end of the month, Prigozhin maintains that the order does not apply to Wagner. \n\nThe group, notorious for its alleged destabilizing activities across Africa and purported interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, remains committed to Russia's interests, according to Prigozhin, but he fears its efficient command structure would be compromised by reporting to Shoigu.",

It makes it harder for ambitious underlings to decide they have enough power to overthrow their master, while also hypothetically pushing both agencies to better performance. \n\nThe reality however often is that having multiple independent military branches under different command structures with similar purposes is wasteful, and leads in infighting and malicious competition like what we've seen between Wagner and the Russian MoD, and what we saw between the Wehrmacht and the SS.\n\nUltimately the initial successes of the Third Reich comes down to a number of factors including but not limited to: \n\nThe development of very new and risky military doctrines utilizing new technologies whose potential was only glimpsed during The Great War.\n\nThe damage (both economically and politically) inflicted by the Great Depression on many capitalist democracies who made up the old Triple Entente Alliance which was then superseded by the new Allies alliance.\n\nHigh amounts of political and civil unrest (especially in Spain and France) caused by clashing radical progressive parties and unions funded by the USSR and radical conservative parties and militias funded by Germany and Italy.\n\nThe political hesitancy from both Briton and France to embroil themselves in another war with Germany, even to meet their mutual defense obligations with countries like Czechoslovakia or Austria. \n\nThe willingness of the USSR to work with the Third Reich to partition Poland and the Baltic states despite the two nations on paper being clear ideological opposites of each other.\n\nThe stagnation of military thinking and doctrine within former members of the Entente who prepared for another war under the misconception that it would inevitably devolve into the same kind of trench warfare seen in The Great War. Preparations that dismissed the very idea that Blitzkrieg was even a possibility, let alone a threat to their militaries.\n\nThe outright incompetence and indecisiveness of both French and British high command who had the opportunity to end the war in the opening weeks, but didn't take it because they made incorrect assumptions about German force strengths along the western front based on bad intelligence, and faulty reasoning that would have been appropriate during WWI, but was no longer valid.\n\nEct. Ect.",

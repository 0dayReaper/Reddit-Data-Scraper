    "postText": "I was born in 1927 in Herne, Germany. To quote from my memoir, \"I am a survivor of Nazi Germany during WW2. During my childhood I had to live 2 lives: a false public one as a loyal Nazi and my true one at home as a Jewish child in an anti-fascist family.\" Though both of my legal parents were German citizens, by biological father was Jewish. My family was always very open and accepting of others, and did not support fascism (but did what they needed to to survive). During WW2, we kept my heritage a secret. As a result, I was raised in the Hitler youth and trained as an anti-aircraft soldier. I was quite tall and desirable to the SS, but I had no interest in becoming one of them, so I volunteered to be in the anti-tank division once I was old enough to enlist.\n\nThough I fought as a German, I never believed in the war and waited for an opportunity to desert. When I was 17 a group of like-minded soldiers and I deserted and became POW in a British camp for 7 months.\n\nWhen the war ended, I returned to the secret family business of smuggling. The economic depression post-WW2 created an opportunity for my family to make money by illegally importing goods from surrounding countries (e.g. women's stockings from France). During this time I married my wife and had my first daughter.\n\nIn 1955, my wife, daughter, and I moved to Montreal, Canada. I worked any job I could get, including work as a butcher (even though I was not trained as one), a gas station attendant, and a candy maker. In 1958 we moved to Thunder Bay where I worked in a factory, then as a logger. There I had 3 more children.\n\nMy family and I eventually moved to Thompson, Manitoba so I could work in the mine. We had a good standard of living there (my wife was quite happy). We had a brand new home and plenty of extra income, but I saw no future for my children there. I lied to my wife, saying I had secured a job at the Britannia Beach mine and moved the entire family across Canada to Squamish, BC. I did end up getting a job in the mine, where I worked for a few months (until they went on strike). After that I worked in a pulp and paper mill (Woodfibre) for 25 years until my retirement.\n\nMy wife passed away from cancer in 2001. Since then I have traveled extensively, remarried, and am living happily in BC. I recently wrote a book about my life and you can find it here: [https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr\\_1\\_4?keywords=fearless&amp;qid=1578004297&amp;sr=8-4](https://www.amazon.ca/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=fearless&amp;qid=1578004297&amp;sr=8-4)\n\nUSA link here :  [https://www.amazon.com/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr\\_1\\_6?keywords=middelmann&amp;qid=1578093209&amp;sr=8-6](https://www.amazon.com/FEARLESS-Jewish-boy-Nazi-Germany/dp/1674561202/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=middelmann&amp;qid=1578093209&amp;sr=8-6)\n\nHello Reddit, I am Roberts grand-daughter. I will be helping him with this post, by asking him your questions and writing his responses. He would like to add that this post makes it sound like his life was a lot more smooth and pre-planned than it was. His life was a lot more 'by the seat of his pants' than this suggests.\n\nBelow we have attached some photos from his life\n\n[https://imgur.com/6HHns4T](https://imgur.com/6HHns4T)\n\n[https://imgur.com/YXmbbvv](https://imgur.com/YXmbbvv)\n\n[https://imgur.com/r8CXl4g](https://imgur.com/r8CXl4g)\n\n[https://imgur.com/M293MDR](https://imgur.com/M293MDR)\n\n[https://imgur.com/33gdQDW](https://imgur.com/33gdQDW)\n\n[https://imgur.com/xKS6AoK](https://imgur.com/xKS6AoK)\n\n[https://imgur.com/NOhWVL6](https://imgur.com/NOhWVL6)\n\n[https://imgur.com/8lR9RkT](https://imgur.com/8lR9RkT)\n\nNSFW [https://imgur.com/t0VDnVX](https://imgur.com/t0VDnVX)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\* EDIT 1\\*\\*\\*\n\nHello everyone, thanks for the overwhelming amount of responses. We are going to stop answering questions for now but we might try and answer some of the bigger ones in the next couple days, when I (grand-daughter) am able to get together with Robert again.\n\nAlso, to people wondering how someone who had a Jewish father, who was killed for being a Jew, could be alive (since the Germans would have killed the whole family). Simply put, Robert's biological father and legal father are two different people. His biological father was one of his neighbors and worked as a sales manager for the family.  Robert found out at 4 years old, but he was still raised to be his legal father's son.\n\n\\*\\*\\*EDIT 2\\*\\*\\*\n\nRobert has asked me (granddaughter) to add his reflections on all the comments he has either read or responded to:\n\nI\u2019d like to thank everyone for their questions and comments, even the ones who insulted me. I am able to understand them. Most of your questions are answered in my memoir, \u201cFEARLESS\u201d \u201cA Jewish boy in Nazi Germany.\u201d I would like to clarify a few things for those who have read my profile. My family was totally opposed to Hitler and the Nazi regime. During the war we risked our lives to help those who were being persecuted by the Nazis. After the war I reconnected with some holocaust survivors who I had helped and were my friends. In 1944 Hitler was losing the war and students were forced to join in the fight. Our entire grade 10 class of 15 and 16-year-old students were placed in the anti-aircraft units. Soon I was made to join the tank division and after my training I was being sent on a suicide mission to blow up allied tanks. In order to avoid this I smashed my foot with a 100 pound boulder. I wanted the allies to win as I saw them as our liberators from an evil and brutal regime. I am very thankful that I escaped armed combat and never killed anyone during the war. It has been estimated that 150,000 Jews or partial Jews served in Hitler\u2019s military. I was one of them.",

Now I see a little better how Nazism overcame Germany not by attack from without or by subversion from within, but with a whoop and a holler. It was what most Germans wanted or, under pressure of combined reality and illusion, came to want. They wanted it; they got it; and they liked it.\n\n&gt;I came back home a little afraid for my country, afraid of what it might want, and get, and like, under pressure of combined reality and illusion. I felt and feel that it was not German Man that I had met, but Man. He happened to be in Germany under certain conditions. He might be here, under certain conditions. He might, under certain conditions, be I.\n\n&gt;If I and my countrymen ever succumbed to that concatenation of conditions, no Constitution, no laws, no police, and certainly no army would be able to protect us from harm. For there is no harm that anyone else can do to",

Since you decided to talk about your interaction with Latinos - I figure I should share mine.\n\n\nIn 2013 I worked in a Rehabilitation Center (drugs/alcohol.) The place was owned and operated by Latinos. Out of 30ish employees I was the only \"white\" guy. Polish to be exact..\n\nI initially was daunted. I had a hard time understanding a lot of the clients strictly because I did not speak any Espanol. By my third or fourth week there - I had this crazy idea to possibly just start learning their language. It was definitely rough - and whatever source proved that learning different languages as you get older is definitely difficult. I found that speaking the basics - and *trying daily* it not only became constructive for myself - but constructive for the *clients.* A year or so in - I could speak Espanol in what I like to call broken sentences - whereas I could say something and they would understand it. I also found that listening to conversations and body cues also entirely helped me out. It was a gain-gain situation, leading a lot of the folks calling me La Pollocko to my actual name. It was at this specific moment that I realized I made a great judgement call by actively trying to learn it. Eventually, the conversations in the other rooms and in the halls became less of indestinctive chatter and more or less automatically translated in my head. I worked there for about 3 years before I went back to Uni and now I think it it safe to say that I can speak *a lot* of Spanish. I still need a lot of work to do within it - and the dialect differs greatly between certain ethnic groups, but this was entirely invaluable to me. I came from working in Roofing and not being able to understand a lick of it. Failed it in High School - but something about seeing peoples faces light up as I attempted to speak it boosted my ego tremendously. On top of this - I got to learn some very very very good dishes.\n\nPiononos, are still one of my favorite dishes to cook. Thanks for sharing.",

Mainly because i have his old field manuals, and he was an artist so he has sketched out all his battles and made his own maps. It's fascinating. I actually just found a typewritten letter that he never told us about. And it was wild and surreal. Anyways your story is fantastic and it is phenomenal that you are taking the time to learn the Internet and share your story with us. Thank you sir.

Like the lowest security prison imaginable.  I guess it\u2019s like a prison in the middle of a desert.  Could you really expect to wander off into a city in Texas and blend in during WW2?  The safest place is in the camp haha.  It was at White Rock Lake if you want to look it up.\n\nEdit - my father in law told me the story last week while we sat by the lake and watched my kid run around and play on T&amp;P hill, and he was pointing across the lake towards the bath house or winfrey hill - I'm not from Dallas so it's all new to me. Hope that helps.\n\nEdit - Edit:   Here y'all go:   https://lakewood.advocatemag.com/2016/07/25/p-o-w-camps-occupied-white-rock-lake-wwii/\n\n\nGoogling White Rock Lake WW2 POW Camp gets lots of articles about it.  Super interesting.",

A lot of high-value prisoners including a couple of former French Prime Ministers were being held in a castle in Austria. \n\nOne dude escaped from the castle but couldn't reach American lines to warn them of the prisoners who were at risk of getting executed by roaming Nazi elements. He did find a former German Army unit led by Major Josef Gangl that had defected to the local anti-Nazi resistance and was trying to stop a nearby town from falling into anarchy, so he tried to get them to liberate the castle.\n\nThose Germans decided they were too weak alone, so they headed west and rendezvoused with advancing American elements, whom they told of the pending situation. The American commander set out with the German defectors to liberate the castle but had to leave most of his tanks behind at a flimsy bridge.\n\n16 Americans and 11 Germans, with one truck and one Sherman tank to their name, fought their way into the castle. Most SS guards had abandoned their posts because they were worried about incoming Allied troops, although one guy remained who had been kind to the prisoners.\n\nSo now this mish-mash of US Army, German Army, 8 former French politicians and celebrities, and an SS officer quickly set up defenses for the castle and hold out for reinforcements. Before reinforcements could get there the SS returned in force, 150 men or so and several pieces of artillery.\n\nThe joint German-French-American coalition held off the Nazis for a while but soon started running low on ammo. Gangl sent French tennis star [Jean Borotra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Borotra) out to warn the American reinforcements to hurry the hell up. Borotra vaulted out of a lower level window and used his world-class athleticism to run like the devil through SS lines and fortifications to get to US lines, which he successfully did before donning a US uniform and guiding American tanks back to the castle, catching the SS by surprise from the rear and taking them prisoner.\n\nThe only Allied casualty during the battle was Gangl, who took a sniper's bullet intended for [Paul Reynaud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Reynaud).\n\n[There's a metal song about the whole thing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwfJsKfCnaM)",

    "postText": "\\*\\*WE ARE DONE! Thanks everyone for all the great questions.\\*\\*\n\nHello, Reddit! It\u2019s World Quantum Day. I am an engineering professor at Princeton University who studies and builds quantum information devices. What does that mean?\n\nIn science, we used to say that quantum mechanics was the physics of atoms and molecules, because that\u2019s the realm where it was first discovered and where its effects are most pronounced.\n\nAll of that is changing now.\n\nBeyond the hype around a \u201csecond quantum revolution\u201d lies an enormous effort by engineers, physicists, chemists and computer scientists to create fundamentally new applications in computing, communications and sensing. And together we are harnessing quantum mechanics into larger and larger systems \u2014 actual technologies \u2014 to solve some of the world\u2019s most complex problems.\n\nWhat do you want to know?\n\nI'll be answering questions at r/IAmA from 1:30pm \u2013\u00a02:30pm ET. You can find out more about my work through [my website](https://houcklab.princeton.edu/) and read my overview of the topic at [Princeton Engineering](https://engineering.princeton.edu/news/2023/01/05/building-technological-stack).

                    "comment": "Quantum information is exceptionally fragile. Defects or impurities in materials can lead to decoherence, the process by which quantum information is destroyed. In order to make better qubits, we need to find better materials. This is a big part of [my research](https://houcklab.princeton.edu/) at Princeton. Working with Nathalie de Leon and Bob Cava, we are trying to figure out what metals, substrates, oxides, etc are the leading causes of loss in superconducting qubits, and how to make them better. This is also a major research thrust as part of our DOE National Quantum Initiative Center (the [Co-Design Center for Quantum Advantage](https://www.bnl.gov/quantumcenter/)).\n\nDefects in diamond are a useful platform for quantum networking and quantum sensing, but there are an enormous number of defects (helpfully cataloged by De Beers). Trying to design and grow new diamonds for quantum purposes is another major effort here on campus, in conjunction with the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.\n\nThere are other long term materials questions that could impact quantum as well. Scientists have speculated that an elusive state known as a Majorana fermion could encode quantum information in a way that is naturally robust against noise. Scientists like Ali Yazdani and Phuan Ong at Princeton are trying to find new materials that actually realize these particles as a new avenue for quantum computing.",

            "comment": "Dear Prof. Houck,\n\nI am a big fan of your research work, especially your experiments on tunable couplers. I have some questions, specifically about tunable coupling architecture. You worked on suppressing photon shot noise to increase coherence times for a tunable coupler setup consisting of two transmons coupled to a superconducting island. Would it be possible to apply this idea to the currently implemented tunable coupler architecture proposed in 2018 by F. Yan?\n\nAlso, tunable coupler architecture has resulted in the implementation of high-fidelity two-qubit gates, which is not possible with static couplers. It has enabled realizing fidelity up to 99.85%, not counting the 99.9% fidelity gate result that was presented in the APS March meeting recently. Given this, how can we further improve on the coupling architecture? In what research directions do you see them being used in the future?\n\nFinally, a general question pertaining to the field of superconducting circuits-based quantum computing.  I would think one possibleresearch milestone achieved in the field in the coming years would be in Quantum Error Correction, given the recent paper by Google in regard to successfully implementing the five-distance surface code with their Sycamore qubit processing unit.  What do you think are the big research goals in the field that would be achieved in the current decade and the next decade?\n\nLooking forward to reading your replies, and thank you very much for the AMA.\n\nBest regards\n\nnumberandphase",

With the amount of energy required to entangle particles, is it possible that entanglement isn't what we think it is? So far, I believe the hypothesis is that it is creating miniature wormholes. Seems overly complicated when most everything is based on more simpler forces and interactions. I do believe there is something happening at a much smaller scale than we can detect currently.",

While I cannot provide an exact figure for the current average salary of a Princeton professor, a rough estimate from publicly available data suggests that the average salary for full-time professors at Princeton University ranges between $150,000 and $250,000 per year.\n\nKeep in mind that salaries can vary significantly based on factors like department, seniority, and research productivity. Additionally, universities typically review and adjust their salary scales periodically, so the actual figures may have changed since my knowledge cutoff date. It's always a good idea to check the latest information from reliable sources or the university's website for the most up-to-date salary information.\"",

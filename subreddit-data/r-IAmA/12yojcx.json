    "postText": "ETA: Hey, all! Thanks for all the great questions today. Just in case anyone ever stumbles upon this thread and has a question, for now we\u2019re not going to lock it. You\u2019re also invited, though, to reach out via DM or through any of our social channels. We\u2019re thebelmontgoats pretty much most of the usual places. Thanks again!\n\nThe Belmont Goats has offered Portland \u201can oasis of rural community amidst the built, urban environment\u201d since 2013. We\u2019re a minor darling of the local press, have had visitors from around the city, around the country, and around the world, and 2023 promises to be full of decade milestones both large and small.\n\nTo mark this rolling anniversary, we\u2019re hosting this AMA now on the 10th birthday of Bambi and Cooper because the herd really started to take off as a thing when these siblings joined at just two-weeks-\nold. After all: baby goats.\n\nIn many ways, Bambi and Cooper mark the official 10th anniversary of The Belmont Goats. Although not yet going by that name, at that point the herd was \u201ccomplete\u201d: no new goats would join until those who were *born* into the herd later in the year.\n\nThere\u2019s ten years of stories to tell and potential questions to ask, so let\u2019s get started! We\u2019ll be answering questions from 10:00am until 10:00pm Pacific, some of that from the field.\n\nDisclaimer: No goats will be answering, at least not without the help of their social medium. Our volunteer staff will be watching the thread and drafting answers in our Slack workspace for posting here.\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/uCY6yYP)!",

(None of them were The Mountain Goats.)\n\nThe intention of an urban herd springs from the original field (on SE Belmont in Portland) where after three years of rented herds an adjacent business owner started his own there because he just liked seeing goats there. It wasn\u2019t long before it was clear that people really used the site as a respite, and when that property was being developed, some of the volunteers bought the herd in order to keep that going.\n\nThanks! We\u2019ll be back to get to the other two questions!",

It\u2019s such a micro-nonprofit that especially with the emergency medical expenses in more recent years it\u2019s almost like you could say a good month is when board members don\u2019t need to go out of pocket for things like feeding the herd. Like many nonprofits, burnout is a risk. We\u2019re fortunate to have all the supporters we do, especially during emergencies where we are fighting to keep a goat going.\n\nAs for a more traditional, full-on sanctuary, the first thing is that it would be such a much larger operation that it\u2019s an open question whether or not it would be feasible to do in an urban fashion here, because you\u2019d need permanent land, not just some city parcel that will be vacant for two or three years. So it\u2019s hard to judge how people would react to such a thing because it might not even have been a doable thing.",

A little of this is answered in another question but we don\u2019t want people to have to jump around, and we love telling the story anyway.\n\nBack in 2010 a local landscape architect spotted two whole square blocks of vacant field on the line between a light industrial area and a residential one. He approached the developer to pitch bringing in goats to clear the brush during summer months.\n\nHis secret agenda was that he also was interest in what an urban neighborhood would think about Sudden Goats.\n\nFor three summers rented herds came in at which point an adjacent business owner asked if he could just start his own herd there because he\u2019d grown to love the idea but wanted goats there year-round.\n\nThat\u2019s the herd that still exists today. The neighborhood of course loved the goats, and people from around Portland would come either for respite or just the whimsy of it. When the land got closer to development, several volunteers bought the herd in order to keep the project going on another property.\n\nThere\u2019s definitely no plans to expand to other cities although people of course are welcome to try on their own and use us as a resource for how to go about it. The project is a very small nonprofit and its capacity is pretty well tapped just maintaining a herd here in Portland.\n\nThanks!",

I let them approach me. Mini goat liked the head pats and then mosied on past me, while grumpy goat started to push against me to the point where I was as gently as I could, steering him in circles essentially spinning the fucker around and then away from me while making my way to the exit without alarming the children. Internally I was fearing for my life concerned he'd think he was part ram, but my partner had recorded me and it looks actually like I had the situation under control and I was doing some slow walking dance routine. His tail was wagging.\n\nThe goat wasn't lowering his head but kept walking towards me while I held him at arms length, span him around me ( to mostly not deal with his horns near my body) and I would release him facing away from me before he would turn around and try to headbutt me.  \n\nSo goat experts: What caused this behaviour? Was it because i was crouching down and stole his goat friend and he decided to assert his dominance and be territorial? If not this, then what other explanations do you think it could be?\n\nWhat should I do in the future to counteract this behaviour in the future? E.g. should i try to become big and loud or should I just accept he is a fucker and leave the enclosure the next time i decide I want to pet some sheep because goats are now on the same level as ducks in terms of evilness?",

Pushing back against a goat doesn\u2019t really get you anywhere good, really.",

(Portland, for example, you can even just have backyard residential goats, though not many.) Other than the legal question the single biggest hurdle is land. For our herd, they began on private property and then moved on to various city-owned lots that eventually would be developed (like the original private lot) but aren\u2019t being used in the meantime.\n\nBeyond those things are the matter of financial support. This herd originally was paid for out of pocket by its original owner. Since then, while the goats themselves are privately-owned there\u2019s a nonprofit that gets to use them for this public good.\n\nAlso, and this is crucial: neighborhood and local resident/groups buy-in.",

                    "comment": "This is a tough question to answer because in ten years we\u2019ve had so many volunteers that there\u2019s simply no one answer. The early-days volunteers simply might pick the day they learned they could go inside with the goats as their favorite story. Or the day they realized they weren\u2019t visiting anymore, they were volunteer goatherds.\n\nThere are a lot of favorite *moments*, like (as we mentioned elsewhere here) the \u201crunning of the goats\u201d across the field in Lents, lured by treats.\n\nCertainly it\u2019s tough to beat the birthings of the two sets of twins who were born into the herd, in September and December of 2013. Not everyone got the chance to see those happen, though.\n\nThere\u2019s also the time the original owner and some friends were in the Belmont field and watching Chester who was up on the platform, and everyone suddenly learned about the thing where male goats will pee on their own faces in order to smell good to the lady goats.\n\nOr that time on Belmont when we all thought there was a weird crow waking toward us and it turned out to be a Silkie Bantam rooster, who stayed with us for six months until we re-homed him. Of course, this sort of happened again with a suddenly-appearing Black Sex Link hen. (Note: don\u2019t dump animals on us.)\n\nOr the time in Lents where while the barn was being built and the herd had just moved in and we wanted to see how the neighborhood was overnight, volunteers slept in sleeping bags on the barn roof, and would wake up and be able to look through the dormer opening down onto the herd.\n\nOr how so many kids have walked in and immediately called Chester \u201cGandalf\u201d.\n\nOr the quiet woman visiting in North Portland with some kids innocently picking figs from the fig tree on-site suddenly finding herself surrounded by goats.\n\nOr how the property owner at the Belmont field once strung that temporary orange plastic fencing up so they could dig a hole for geo-engineering tests but Chester just ran a hole through it like the Kool-Aid Man.\n\nWe will say that the single most *infamous* story is the morning back on Belmont when we got a call that there was a goat tied to our fence. Sure enough, there was our own Bambi. A couple had literally just left watching through the fence and they\u2019d turned back like a block away and spotted it. Someone had to have waited until their left. It seems Bambi had spent some time at a party, as evidenced by her horns having been somehow stained a festive pink-red. Note: do not steal other people\u2019s goats.\n\n(Not for nothing but that Black Sex Link hen? Years later after we moved to the Lents neighborhood, she took an unexpected trip of her own. One that might have included a trip on the local light rail, because she was spotted by a supporter of the goats several stops away.)\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, we hope that over the year other people share their own favorite stories. We\u2019ve got a BelmontGoats10th hashtag ready and waiting for them.",

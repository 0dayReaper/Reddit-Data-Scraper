I am going to close for the day.**\n\nAsk me anything about art therapy, dreams, creativity, or the search for meaning.\n\nMy background includes a fine art degree in undergrad (2003), earning a master\u2019s in art therapy in 2018, and earning a national credential as a board-certified art therapist in 2021. I also hold a master\u2019s level dream pattern certificate (2019).\n\nMy proof:  [https://imgur.com/y4MoOpo](https://imgur.com/y4MoOpo)\n\nI've worked in hospitals, hospice, and agencies, assisting clients from ages 4 to 91.\n\nCurrently, I work with adults, using clients\u2019 fantasies, dreams, and art images.

                    "comment": "Art therapy is great for perfectionism because we are so quick to judge ourselves.  In art therapy I do a couple of things with clients to work on perfectionism.  Here are some examples:\n\n1.  We make UGLY art.  If the goal is to make an ugly mess, how can you go wrong?\n2. I often encourage people in art therapy to set the intention that \"there is no wrong or right way to do this.  anything goes\" \n3. Can we accept what is and use it as a way to learn rather than think of it as failure.  I love Angela Duckworth's book Grit where she talks about having an attitude of learning and using falling short of the goal as \"practice\" and part of the learning process.\n4. We also try to work on self-compassion.  How would you encourage a niece/nephew, child, or your best friend?  Try that with yourself too.",

I have a video example of me demonstrating it here:  https://youtu.be/XLpDTAou6u0\n\nHere's the thing. you wouldn't be battling me.  I'm not a teacher and I don't give grades.  The perception of the judgement is internal.  That battle is within you.  \n\nThe art would not be what you would normally define as art.  It would be more about self-compassion work and acceptance rather than making anything.  \n\nI like Buddha Boards for this too.  the image you made disappears in a few seconds and you start again.  Nothing is permanent.  \n\nWe live in world where we are tested on everything in school which is absurd.  What would happen when there isn't a right answer, or an expectation for performance? \n\nOne of my favorite quotes is, \"Good art is not what it looks like, but what it does to us.\" by Roy Adzak.  \n\nIs ugly art something that would offend my mother? or ugly art something that make me respond with \"gross!\".  There's not \"right\" answer to that.\n\nThank you for exploring this with me.",

You are focusing on sitting with that decision and how it might feel, trying to hold onto that feeling and \"sit\" in it.  Then a couple of days later go back to both visual images and see how you respond emotionally to them.  A lot of times you'll get new insight from this. \n2. Journaling.  I start to explore what is connected to how I feel about things, often asking the question \"why is that?\" as you explore, sometimes you will get down to \"because my mom told me I SHOULD\" or \"Please no don't make me do that!\" will suddenly pop into your writing. \n3. See how each decision feels in your body.  I recommend sitting and exploring what your body feels like.  Or you can do a \"body scan\".  Look for youtube guided meditations on this if you want more details, or you can just explore what things feel like.  Do I feel cold, sweaty, \"what is this tightness in my throat\". When you get connected to a feeling, start to be curious and ask questions about it, \"what might this be about, what is it trying to tell me.\" Then hold it in an attitude of listening to it,  your imagination will help you get clearer.\n4. If none of that works, sleep on it.  Creativity research shows that often new ideas are synthesized when we quit consciously thinking about something and go do something else.  I learned how to parallel  park in my dreams.  I woke up one morning and crashed into the kitchen, announcing to my mom \"I can do it!\" I was right.  I had synthesized it with my unconscious, not when I was practicing.",

Often, people had a critical person in their life growing up and they have internalized this person's criticism as part of themselves.  Often in art therapy, I do inner child work with my clients so that they can be the \"good enough parent\" for themselves.  I provide an encouraging environment for them to work on building their confidence and feelings of self-worth.  Then we make a doll that represents their inner child.  What does a child need?  Hugs, encouragement, words of love, feeling safe and cared for, and feeling seen.  In making and working with the doll that nagging, gaping feeling starts to feel nourished.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe other way to look at it is having really big dreams, goals, and a sense of destiny.  This happens for a lot of intelligent, gifted, or ambitious people.  I recommend the book the Gap and the Gain that talks about measuring yourself from what you've accomplished and where you've come from rather than measuring your present against some sort of imagined ideal.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProgress not perfection!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this makes sense.",

Much of art therapy is about the relationship between the therapist and the client.    \n\n\nHowever, there are a ton of things that you can do with therapeutic arts on your own.  Some of these things would include art journaling, mindfulness activities, affirmations, and things like ZenTangle(tm) or SoulCollage(tm).    \n\n\nI have a free resource on my website for starting a therapeutic art practice as home which might be a great intro to this sort of practice and fits really well into what you were asking about.  you can find it here:  https://columbusarttherapy.com",

The way I've gotten around it is a couple of ways:\n\n1.  just writing.  not expecting it to be \"good\" or organized, or whatever, but just doing the thing.  I can throw 75% of it away if I dont' like it, reorganized, keep what works and keep going.  Pablo Picasso probable made 50,000 art pieces but only about 1% of those are considered important or famous.  It's a numbers game.  The more you make, the more will sooner or later hit home.  \n2. I recommend Morning Pages, an exercise from Julia Cameron's The Artist Way.  She says write 3 pages of free form, long hand, stream of consciousness writing.  You aren't trying to make anything, just sit and write.  It helps purge the garbage thought monkeys from messing with your head.  It also takes the pressure off as well as creating a habit of writing.  \n3. If you feel like your rut is self-inflected, it is probably related to a limiting belief that is holding you back.  psychoanalysis helps you uncover these unconscious limitations or emotional barriers and work through them.

My gap was great for me, even though it went on too long but I didn't have the goal to pursue art therapy until about 2008.    \n\n\nI would recommend a couple of things:  \n\nVolunteer with art making whether it be in a mental health setting or a community arts setting.  It helps keep you involved, engaged, and you'll learn something.  You also need volunteering on your resume for grad school anyway.\n\nAlso, make a commitment now to a personal art practice.  I come back to this over and over and it is so rewarding and important for an art therapist to also uphold their identity as an artist.  It is also super important as self-care too.  You can't expect clients to do the hard work in art therapy if you don't also have this practice with yourself.  \n\n\nIf you haven't started personal therapy yet, that is my number one recommendation for art therapy students.  You can't know your blind spots working with clients if you haven't worked through them personally.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck to you!",

Studies are showing that accessing the visual parts of the brain are an effective way to treat PTSD, which is also stored in the visual centers of the brain.  PTSD symptoms often include flashbacks and nightmares, both visual symptoms.    \n\n\nUsing your imagination to engage in creative problem solving activates neuroplasticity and often will help someone experiencing depression start to feel better sooner than with medication alone.  \n\n\nPainting and art making often gives people a sense of satisfaction, enjoyment and sense of mastery from learning something new.  For those I've worked with in palliative or hospice care, it gives them something positive to talk to their family members about and create legacy projects.  Then they have something to talk about that they makes them smile, rather than just talking about their illness.\n\nOther studies are showing, and I've seen this working in rehabilitation hospitals for those in acute pain, that the art can help alleviate pain both in acute cases as well as for chronic pain.  \n\nCreativity research shows a correlations for those who have a creative outlet and an overall sense of wellbeing.\n\nWe have a lot of defense mechanisms with habitual ways of talking.  Art works around some of those so that we can get down to what your unconscious is trying to tell you.",

(Mine said \u201ctell me who you are\u201d, I asked what she meant for clarification, she said \u201cthere are no wrong answers\u201d, then when I tried to answer she got visibly frustrated and accused me of \u201cstonewalling\u201d. Turned out there *were* wrong answers after all, lol.)\n\nAnyways, can I give you an example of how painting helped me recently?\n\nWe had devastating floods in my city in January, and a 1-in-250 year cyclone the following week. I wasn\u2019t personally affected, my house was generally fine, my people were safe, but I was so *emotionally* affected by the devastation I had to take 2 weeks off work. I didn\u2019t know why it affected me so much, and I felt so many things, I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. Then I got out my (not used in years) paints and decided to paint it out.\n\nI walked down to the waterfront and took a photo - bright blue skies, sun shining, but the sea was a weird muddy green, and there were land slips all along the cliff above the road. That expressed it perfectly to me - on the surface \u201ceverything\u2019s fine\u201d, but if you look closely, things are off, there are scars on the landscape.\n\nI spent the next two weeks painting that photo, and donating goods and money to the cyclone relief in between. While I painted, I had the mental space to reflect on PTSD I\u2019d been carrying for years from previous crises, and I was able to acknowledge that, learn some tools to remind myself I\u2019m safe, and to let it go.\n\nI felt so much better afterwards. It was genuinely healing.",

            "comment": "Hello! First off, thank you for coming today to answer everyone's questions. I've been an overachiever all my life (still kind of am), and I wanted to ask for some specific input from both an art perspective and a therapy perspective. I'm somebody who is very driven in terms of career, academics, volunteering, and athleticism, but art was something I used to enjoy for myself that I had lost on and off as my life got busier with college and work. Aside from my overbooked schedule, however, my perfectionism just gets in the way of any inspiration.\n\nWhen I was in middle school, I was always the kid who doodled in my planner and carried a sketchbook with me. There were times that I would practice with landscapes or still-lives, but the bulk of what I drew were characters from media I liked. I also used to avidly create my own characters, but of course, as an adolescent who didn\u2019t have much technical experience in creativity, the characters weren\u2019t very well-written. \n\nI want to have the joy and contentment I used to have while drawing, but all I can think of while putting pencil to paper is, \"What's the point of making this if I'll be ashamed of it in one, two, or five years when I'm more aware of the mistakes that I am blissfully ignorant of now? What is it about this creation that will reveal to more experienced artists that I am an amateur clearly motivated by emotional fulfillment, to which they will be amused by and maybe even joke about behind my back?\" \n\nIt\u2019s not just about technical aspects of the art either. If someone tells me that all the colors I\u2019m using are too saturated and that I need to balance the colors better, that\u2019s something I can work with. What I\u2019m deeply afraid of is that my interest in drawing the things that I really enjoy because they will betray deeply personal flaws to others that I will be blind to, if that makes sense. \n\nUsually, I come across well-intended pithy quotes like, \"Don't listen to the haters! Your art is not for them! Draw what you love!\" Which I politely accept because I know that they're given with love, but they're not as convincing as full comment threads of people taking other people\u2019s art to nitpick and criticize - sometimes with valid criticisms in good faith, but oftentimes to insult the creator because they are seen as cringeworthy (especially if the creator is neurodivergent, particularly autistic). Is this something you\u2019ve encountered from clients before?",

There are several things I do in life where I will never be great at it but I do it because I enjoy it.  Sometimes there is that for a motivator.  I like the idea of getting the opportunity to engage with the creative process and being less focused on the product of that engagement.  \n\n\nI have seen people with a lot of blocks focused on the negative thoughts.  I think this is something to be worked through as it is usually getting in your way.  \n\nMary Oliver said something to to the tune of, \"It's none of my business what other people think of my art.  My business is to make art and put it out there.\"   \n\n\nI also think you're talking about imposter syndrome, of thinking that you don't have a valid seat at the table of art making.  I believe that to be creative is to be human.  We all have the innate interest and capacity to make art until someone tells us to stop.

If a client was working on a project for a while but comes into the office with a different concern not related to that project we switch gears and follow the what seems most important that day.  In art therapy it doesn't matter if we finish a project (unless that's the main goal we are working on).  \n\nThe art is often a tool for listening to our emotions and bodies and therefore also the language of the unconscious.  We often aren't striving for a \"finished art piece.\"    \n\n\nWith school, in undergrad I had to take a lower class load because I was also working and struggling with untreated anxiety at the time.  It was a good way for me to manage being able to take care of myself and not get overwhelmed.  Even one class at a time would get a degree finished, it would just take longer.  That's the thing about getting overwhelmed, what good to crashing and burning do?  It's better to get to where you can be gentle with your body, mind, and soul's needs and take care of yourself rather than push too hard to the breaking point.  \n\n\nDepression and anxiety often go hand in hand.  I work with my clients to find a middle ground between ramping up into a panic driven productivity, and then running out of energy into a total crash.  Often this pattern is related to lack of support in childhood and can be realigned and sorta smoothed out to a more manageable rhythm.    \n\n\nTo get there we use a lot of physical sensing check ins to see what your body needs.

A myth that comes to mind is Icarus.\n\nCarl Jung considered the second half of life when we start to turn from the outside approval of the world and increase our attention in an introverted way to what is going on inside our selves and searching for internal validation and alignment with an authentic sense of self rather than our public personas.  I'm sure Jung actually dealt with this a lot as he had quite the public notoriety during his career.  \n\nIn the case of Michael Jackson, he was larger than life on stage.  It was said he almost seemed to be a bigger person when he stepped into his public role.  However, this was so far from how he felt about himself on the inside that he was tortured.  He felt estranged from himself.\n\nWith the myth of Icarus, he was warned not to fly too close to the sun or the sun would melt the wax holding the feathers on his wing.  Furthermore he couldn't fly too close to the sea or his wings would get wet, and again, he would fall.  He got so exhilarated with the feeling of flying that he flew higher and higher toward the sun, and ultimately fell to his death.  Psychologically this is a story about hubris and feeling too Godlike, also called a psychological inflation.  In an inflation, we take on qualities that are not really ours, bigger than a single human life, the narcissistic inflation you are talking about.  The best way to avoid this pit fall is to have as much of a normal human life as possible.  Jung felt grounded by his family and his work during his most creative years.  Other people feel grounded in a close group of friends, membership in a church or similar social setting, their families, or just the daily schedule of making a living.  I find it through things like walking my dog, doing the laundry, and having to take care of my physical needs such as taking care of my blood sugar and arthritis.    \n\n\nI highly recommend the book After the Ecstasy the Laundry by Jack Kornfield which talks about adapting to the boring, tedium of regular daily life after having peak experiences.",

I also recommend Art for All the Children as another text.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested in mindfulness worksheets the Mindful Doodle book by Patricia Isis is great for copying.

Being able to copy proportionally is about draftsmanship and not creative or self-esteem building.  \n\nAnything that you do that encourages processing feelings and movement in the body, visual self-expression and creative play and exploration will be helpful.  This world needs all the creative expression we can get.  Here's other prompts:\n\nDrawing emotions, going beyond sad, glad, mad, and scared\n\nCreating themselves as super heroes\n\ndrawing a response to a piece of music.  \n\nbodyscan guided meditation.  then you draw out how you felt.\n\nDrawing your safe space\n\ndrawing a rainy day and talking about being sad\n\ncreating an animal out of model magic, talking about how it might symbolize qualities of yourself.  creating an environment with all the animal needs on a piece of paper.\n\nWorking together with recyclable found objects to create a city together as a group project and talking about the different parts that need to be incorporated.  This could be done as a mural relating to a story or an environment, etc.  \n\nThank you for the work you do and for valuing art.  I really appreciate it!",

I believe that much of art therapy was influenced by Carl Jung and his own process with working with images from his fantasies, or active imaginations, and his dreams.  He theorized that the archetypes come to us as images that are driving the instincts.  He also said our dreams speak in the ancient language of images.  Another way to look at it is that we start processing visual images before we learn the symbolic uses of language.  So, the visual centers of the brain are developed first.  Our earliest learning around us is a visual language.  So the images that we get from our dreams often relate to a very early part of ourselves.  Getting in touch with that visual language directly through art therapy is a way to access a deeper level of the symbol and process it with the parts of the brain where the images came from.  \n\nI often find with a dream that if I draw it, I get a better perspective on it, a get some reflected distance as we say in art making.",

And then a picture flashes of my hands a light green porcelain sculpture of a shell into his hands.\n\nIf you have any thoughts on that specifically I\u2019d love to hear them. Generally I wonder if you have any thoughts on what people can do with their dreams - processing them or using information from them? I tend to either receive clarifying messages in dreams very late after events unfold or I get question raising dreams about current events that are confusing and later on seem to be almost predictive of what will happen, but i do not usually understand the connection until it\u2019s too late for me to use anything I \u201clearn\u201d.

I have found that even a little bit of dream analysis with a dream often connects current patterns to past traumas in a really visceral and pertinent way.  This goes into therapy work, which due to safety, care, and privacy, can't happen on social media.  \n\n\nClients find that they are more connected to that deep part of themselves once they start doing dream therapy.  Sometime we can pinpoint what energy is moving and brace for its manifestation as it gets ready.  Other times, the energetic shift happens within us in the dream in a way that we can tell what it relates to in the outerworld before we are caught unawares by the shock wave.  \n\nFor basic dream knowledge, I recommend using google or wikipedia as a start for what a symbol means in the real world.  I am sure that sea urchins have characteristics particular to them as a species.  \n\nAnother good place to start would be reading Inner Work by Robert Johnson.  I especially enjoy his chapter about rituals and responding to a dream by an action in the world.  I have done this several times and found that the meaning became clearer when I performed an action in relationship to the dream image.",

It certainly wasn't creative but I felt like a flat tire at the end of the day.    \n\n\nAre you giving too much of yourself?  This is sort of a rhetorical question.  I find that I am drained when I am having a boundary issue with myself such as; working too many hours in the day, not taking a break when I need it, or skipping lunch or not taking enough breaks.  If we give what we don't have emotionally or mentally to give of ourselves we are like a dry well.  That's the boundary piece to ponder.  It's so easy to give too much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other thing is that creativity can't always be monetized or have a value placed on it according to the market.  The Gift by Lewis Hyde blew my mind about two ways to look at creativity.  He talks about the nature of engaging with the spirit of creativity for its own sake in the first half.  The second half he talks about capitalism and the commercial market.  They aren't always in alignment with one another.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also find that when I am drained, I have an unfulfilled need that's coming from deep inside me that I'm ignoring or devaluing.  When you approach this internal need as legitimate and prioritize it as serious, you start to feel better.  My first therapist said, \"I do know this, that when creative people don't create bad things happen.\"  \n\nOh man he was right I think.",

In the second half of the book he talks about art from a capitalist commodity in the marketplace.  These two modes are often at odds.  \n\nI would bet that you have an unmet need that you are not prioritizing.  Psyche's are tricky.

He would leave a party in the middle of it to go pay tribute to his sacred creative time.  One of my favorite authors gets up at 3:30am to spend the wee hours in his office writing and reading.  It is a sacred discipline for him.  This is the level of deference to your creative time that I'm talking about.    \n\n\nI have several hours every morning that I spend walking, reading, and working with my dream and art journal.  I feel off and get really cranky when I don't take care of it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLikewise when I overdo my work.  For example, I had a feeling well up in my a couple weeks ago that I wanted to go take a nap, do art, or take a walk in the middle of the day.  I told myself to shut up and get my paper work done.  When I finished my paperwork, my back went out.  That little voice that needed a break was serious.  It was by body begging for some love.  Learning this process of surrender to the internal movement of psyche can be a struggle, but is so rewarding when you are able to let go.",

I have at times encouraged people to destroy things as their \"art making\".  It can be cathartic to \"get it out\" and then feel like it's no longer trapped inside you.  I've been known to put a bunch of angry, splattery paint on something, rip up art, write a letter and burn it, or encourage people to smush a clay sculpture.  I also enjoy wedging clay for this because its loud, you get to throw something, and it feels physical.  \n\nthere can be destruction before something can arise from it.  I think about this when I'm weeding in my garden too. \n\nI'm also reminded of the litany of fear from Dune.  I think it could apply for anger too.  Some say fear is underneath what we feel as anger.\n\nThe Litany is as follows:  \n\"I must not fear.  \nFear is the mind-killer.  \nFear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.  \nI will face my fear.  \nI will permit it to pass over me and through me.  \nAnd when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.  \nWhere the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.\"  \n\n\nOnly when we disallow ourselves to feel or bottle up emotion does it create a block... like a pressure cooker.  If we let it flow through in a way that isn't destructive to society, then we remain after we've experienced it.",

There is a lot of misinformation on the internet that talks about it being the dark parts or the parts we don't like.  If you can see that it's a part you don't like, it's something you can see and not in your shadow.  In dreams, the shadow shows up most often as a peer that you are in conflict with.  In the world if shows up through projections with people's actions that irritate you or attitudes, behaviors, etc, that you are opposed to.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThink of a book or movie character you hate.  draw or paint the image.  then dialog with it, being curious about the conversation and sit with a listening attitude,  you are preplanning the conversation, you are waiting for it to spontaneously arise in your mind.  That can give you a little insight.  Jung called this technique active imagination.  My favorite book about it is called Jung on Active Imagination edited by Joan Chodorow.  \n\n\nThe work I did that I thought was shadow work on my own paled in comparison to when I started doing personal Jungian analysis.  It is just so hard to see your blind spots on your own.  It's also hard to keep shadow material in your consciousness for every long and actually think about it.  Has someone said something ever and you've had to get them to repeat themselves cause you for some reason couldn't process it?  It's like that.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps some.",

In Elizabeth Gilbert's Ted Talk about Genius, she tells a story about Mary Oliver where sometimes she would have to run home as fast as she could to catch what she wanted to write before it passed through her.  If we don't tend the creative spirit it, fizzles out.  The more we show up to make things, the more energy we get to make more and it feeds all sorts of parts of our lives.  Don't worry about the quality of it.

How would you help someone who is really on the verge of achieving their dreams/goals, but is afraid to move forward and maybe has a tendency to sabotage themselves?",

                    "comment": "sounds like there's an unconscious limiting belief somewhere in there that is acting as a saboteur.  A part is at odds with the achievement.  I recommend reading up on the idea of the set-point.  My favorite book about breaking through these sorts of limitations is the The Big Leap by Gay Hendrix.    \n\n\nI also often see fear as denoting that I'm in foreign territory and something is changing.  It's natural to feel afraid when something new is happening.  Our brains are designed to protect us which is instinctually at odds with achieving or experiencing anything.  I also see that fear as potential energy that I can channel into what is about to happen.  \n\nFirst day of school, stepping onto a stage, going to a job interview, etc.  All of these things make me nervous, but if I wasn't nervous, I would be worried that it wasn't important or I wasn't taking it seriously.",

                    "comment": "First off I want to say that art therapists don't \"interpret art.\"  However, while working with a client we do notice things that are worth mentioning about the client's engagement with their artwork, how they talk about it, etc.  We often prompt clients to get curious and ask questions about the art to help clients express themselves more fully.    \n\n\nThere is one assessment that has validity that I often use to inform me about art marks and the qualities of the artwork and that is the FEATS (The Formal Elements Art Therapy Scale).  It looks at line quality, density of art on the page (how much white space), color, etc.  We are trained to be able to see certain symptoms in the art that can include: depression, anxiety, psychosis, and dementia.  However, these symptoms can be from different causes which is why we always involve the client's feedback and their other behaviors as well.  A traumatic brain injury can manifest in different ways with artwork, and low self esteem might look like depression.  Really creative use of color and subject matter could look like psychosis, if someone didn't take into account the client's behavior as well.  It isn't a simplistic formula.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, I also look at patterns and motifs with my clients' artwork as it progresses overtime to see how things change.  When something new starts to be incorporated, it is often a reflection of the something changing within the client's mood or life that they are now expressing.",

                    "comment": "I would call that a coping mechanism to deal with isolation and loneliness.  I think you would be best served by someone who specializes in Internal Family System work and/or Jungian orientation.  Both work well with those who are imaginative and help you integrate your internal figures.  We all have internal figures, its just a matter of how much people pay attention to their internal world.  It sounds like you are pretty attuned to your introversion.\n\nI would not call specifically what you are talking about a \"disorder.\"  However, the cPTSD and the autism can be supported by a therapist who specializes in cPTSD.  Someone who might be a good fit for you would talk about attachment theory and cPTSD.  Therapists who specialize in these concerns understanding working with people who need to feel really comfortably at their own pace and not rush things along.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany of my clients intellectually know what is going on but know how to feel emotions or sense their body sensations.  That's a trauma response too.  If it's not safe to be in your body, you aren't going to connect to emotions.\n\nSo yes, the right therapist can help you on your journey.  I also recommend the books, Jung on Active Imagination edited by Joan Choderow and Focusing by Eugene Gendlin as possible other resources for you if you are interested in doing solo work outside of therapy.",

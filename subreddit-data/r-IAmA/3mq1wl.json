    "postText": "Today, NASA confirmed evidence that liquid water flows on present-day Mars, citing data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The mission's project scientist and deputy project scientist answered questions live from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, from 11 a.m. to noon PT (2-3 p.m. ET, 1800-1900 UTC).\n\n**Update (noon PT): Thank you for all of your great questions. We'll check back in over the next couple of days and answer as many more as possible, but that's all our MRO mission team has time for today.**\n\nParticipants will initial their replies:\n\n* Rich Zurek, Chief Scientist, NASA Mars Program Office; Project Scientist, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\n* Leslie K.

We also have a rover in development for the 2020s (same basic design as MSL/Curiosity) and NASA is considering the science that might fly on the next Mars orbiter to be launched sometime after the 2020 rover.    \n\nThe instruments that are chosen to fly are selected because they can accomplish the science goals of the mission, so as the science goals change - with new discoveries - instruments will be proposed and selected accordingly. \n\nThe food at JPL is actually quite good!

Is it possible that these microbes sent by us could harm Martian life?\n\nThank you!",

Cells like to have a specific range of 'saltiness' and deviating from that range can kill them. Granted, microorganisms are hardy and quick to adapt, which is why you see them pretty much everywhere on Earth (even really salty places). \n\nMy guess at what the responder is trying to say is the water on Mars may even be *too* salty for life form in the first place. \n\nMe? I like to bet on the tenacity of life. Working in the biology field it's incredible just how pesky microorganisms can be. ",

What might happen to the life when the water disappears?|It's possible. We know of forms of life that hibernate during dry seasons on Earth. The water that we're seeing within the RSL (the seasonal dark streaks that we're seeing on slopes on Mars) is salty. Salty water could be harmful to life.\nIt was mentioned that there's life on Mars in the form of microbes on the machinery. Is it possible that these microbes sent by us could harm Martian life?|We don't know what Earth life could do to any potential life on other worlds. That's why we try to clean our spacecraft very carefully. -- LT\nWhat's the next step?|The next step is to look for more locations where brine flows may occur. We have covered 3% of Mars at resolutions high enough to see these features. -RZ\nWhat are some examples of microbes that could be living on the rover that you are concerned with infecting the surface of Mars?|These features are on steep slopes, so our present rovers would not be able to climb up to them. Because liquid water appears to be present, these regions are considered special regions where we have to take extra precautions to prevent contamination by earth life. Our current rovers have not been sterilized to the degree needed to go to an area where liquid water may be present. -RZ\nIf the rovers haven't been properly sterilized already, will this throw doubt upon any possible future discovery of Mars-based microbes living in or near the water? Wouldn't detractors be able to claim that they are microbes that somehow survived from Earth?|The rovers have been sterilized for their particular landing sites where there's been no evidence of present day liquid water. To go to the RSL rovers will be required to be sterilized to a higher level. We also take samples of microbes that might be on the spacecraft before they're launched, so we can compare with any future discoveries. -RZ\nCould you explain why you can't go near the water? Is it for fear of harming the rover? Or contaminating the water?|It's both. The dark streaks are on slopes that are too steep for our present rovers. Also, we want to be careful to not introduce Earth bugs into an environment that may have liquid water. -RZ\nHow long into the future do you think it will be before we can realistically think about sending humans to Mars?|Presently, NASA is looking into the possibility of sending humans to the vicinity of Mars in the early 2030s. In this scenario, the earliest humans to the surface would be in the late 2030s. -RZ\nWhat quantity of water are we talking about? what volume?|We think this is a very small amount of water -- maybe just enough to wet the top layer of the surface of Mars. The streaks are ~4-5 meters wide and ~200-300 meters long. -- LT\nHow much liquid water are we talking about? Like.. tap water leaking when you don't close the valve tight enough, or Niagara falls?|Tap water leaking. -RZ\nIt was [shown back in 2011](http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/04aug_marsflows/) that salt water flows may be a seasonal occurrence. What was the final proof for the team that this was happening, and what was your initial reaction to the data?|With MRO, we were able to observe a few of these sites at various points within the Mars year, and again the next year. Over time, we saw that the streaks darkened and lengthened during the warm season and faded during the cold season. A benefit of having MRO lasting so long is that we're able to see changes and patterns over time. My reaction? This is all very exciting! The closer we look at Mars, the more interesting it gets. -- LT\nIs NASA now considering putting a man on Mars to get more data on this or can we find all the information without having a man/woman on Mars?|The basic answer is yes, NASA is planning to send humans to Mars in the 2030s. It's always helpful to have more information before sending them, and that's why our robotic explorers are so important. -- LT\nDo any of the space scientists at NASA write poetry/do art? If their art is inspired by their scientific work, can you please share it with us?|Absolutely. It takes all kinds of creative minds to do science and engineering that no one has ever done before. Among our mission teams, you'll find actors, musicians, sculptors, painters -- the list goes on. For visual artists, two individuals who spring to mind are [Bill Hartmann](http://www.psi.edu/about/staff/hartmann/painting.html) and [Dan Goods](http://www.directedplay.com/). -- SLS\nIs there any evidence of evaporation happening on Mars? And do you know where this water came from?|Is there any evidence of evaporation happening on mars? And do you know where this water came from?\nWhat does this mean in regards to possible life?|We think liquid water is essential for life (at least as we know it.) That does not mean that life is there; but, it's a good place to look. -RZ\nIf the Mars rover were to travel to the site of the briny water, what would be the scientific procedure for determining if that water supports life?|The Curiosity rover does not have life detection instruments. It would look for confirmation that liquid water was present and how long during the day it was liquid. -RZ\nWhat would be the procedure if life is found on Mars? WOuld the public be made aware? Who gets told first?|Information flows to the public very quickly. If one of our missions here at JPL detected life, we'd notify NASA headquarters immediately, who would then follow procedures to notify the US government and the public. -- SLS\nIn the articles I've read so far, the water is referred to as \"briny\" and that it's more fluid than it is water. What does that mean? Would this be something theoretically possible to drink or grow things with? Or would this be the kind of thing that would need purification before it could be used?|The salts in the water appear to be perchlorates, so I wouldn't want to drink the water. To be a future resource for humans, you would want to remove the salts. -RZ\nThis may be a bit far-future looking, but does the fact that we know liquid flowing water exists mean anything for terraforming Mars in the future?|Think of this as a \"seep\" not a flow. We have not seen flowing water on the surface. We see something that darkens the soil, which may be just a wetting action but still involves (briny) liquid. -RZ\nGiven the seasonal nature of today's discovery, does this suggest that their is a hydrologic cycle on Mars?|There is a hydrologic cycle on Mars, but typically it involves vapor going to ice (frost) or ice going to vapor. There is no rain in Mars today, but there may have been very early in its history. -RZ\nScale of 1-10, how excited does this make you guys? Is this a huge deal for the scientific community?|This is super exciting! It is an important discovery because it is evidence that supports our hypothesis that the RSL (seasonal dark streaks that appear to flow in the warm season) are flowing briny (salty) water. --LT\nHow close is the rover to the water? Will you be able to get close enough to get pictures without contamination?|There are no confirmed brine flows (RSL) near Curiosity nor Opportunity. There are in Gale Crater some interesting slope streaks but they are several km away from the Curiosity's present path. -RZ\nWhat do you say to those who would argue we already had proof with the ice caps? Obviously, they're full of water. Don't they melt periodically?|The ice caps freeze and sublime (solid to vapor.) The RSL water stays liquid because it has salts in it. Yes, we know there's water on Mars. We're looking for where it stays liquid for an extended period of time. -RZ\nWhat was the hardest technical challenge you faced on this project? What was the hardest nontechnical (political, cultural, legal, emotional &amp;c) challenge?|The features that darken and fade as temperatures get warmer and then colder are long but narrow. The difficulty was to get enough resolution from our orbiter instruments to first detect, and then characterize what these features are. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) can do that with its HiRISE camera and CRISM Mineral Mapper. -RZ\nWhy should the average joe care about this? What does this mean for science and space exploration?|Liquid water, even if very salty, is still a good place to look for life forms. We don't know how robust martian life (if it exists) could be. Also, water in any form is a resource that future missions could exploit. -RZ\nWith the discovery of water on Mars does that mean there could be rainbows on Mars?|Not quite rainbows, because there is no rain, but we have seen icebows with the Pathfinder mission. -- RZ\n\nThanks for doing this AMA, /u/NASAJPL!",

The difficulty was to get enough resolution from our orbiter instruments to first detect, and then characterize what these features are. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) can do that with its HiRISE camera and CRISM Mineral Mapper. -RZ",

I can hardly fathom what kind of life may have once been on Mars - but it's kind of depressing to think that it is something that was once but unless terraforming becomes  a thing - Mars will remain a grave stone of a world where life once may have thrived.

Or is it frozen in the crust today? Mars seems to have ice ages when water at the poles is sublimated and redistributed to the rest of the planet. Ice in the crust today may have been formed during one of those ice age cycles. -RZ",

For example, \"Harlem Shake\" went to No. 1 in 2013 because the Hot 100 formula had been recently adjusted to incorporate YouTube data.  \nOf course, methodologies are never perfect and any legacy system for music tracking/gatekeeping is bound to have biases (who could forget when Billboard kicked \"Old Town Road\" out of country charts?). -Callie",

Before that, it was the sudden switch from vinyl to cassette, then cassette to CDs. \n\nAll this to say, the music industry is always evolving and I don't think there's anything inherently sinister about artists who rise to fame through social media, whether it's YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, or SoundCloud. -Callie",

I didn't mean to imply there's anything sinister about Marc Rebillet. I'm a huge fan of his.\n\nIt seems like the music industry has focused a lot more on promoting artists who have already achieved some level of fame on social media as a sort of proof of concept that they're worthy of investment, rather than periods in the past where relatively unknown yet incredibly talented performers would be elevated to fame by a label taking a risk and having that gamble pay off.",

It's hard to market a new artist in a traditional way when fans today are so savvy and hyper-aware of marketing tactics. \n\nI think social media's most significant effect is democratization. It sounds corny, but fans want authenticity. Growth has to be organic (or at least *seem* organic). The power is in the hands of the people who consume music (as opposed to labels and PR professionals) more so than ever before, and I think the industry's eagerness to promote already-popular artists on social media is a reflection of that trend. Labels want to throw their weight behind someone that audiences already like, so they can skip the hard part. -Callie",

Music reporters get hundreds of emails from publicists and labels and PR professionals every day, so it's important to personalize.

It's quite cute when you think about it like collecting souvenirs or preserving a memory. Taking photos and videos eases the existential dread of time passing.\n\nOn the other hand, I do think there has to be a line. I try to give myself a personal limit: take videos during two or three songs, then put your phone away and enjoy the rest. There is definitely something to be said for \"being in the moment,\" and it can be really frustrating when you're trying to connect with an emotional song and you can hardly see the singer through a sea of iPhones. I do think some people take it too far.\n\nAs for your second question, it has to be rock \u2014 hard, classic, alt, emo, all of the above. There's nothing like hearing an electric guitarist nail a live solo. And I don't think that's weird at all! Contrast is one of the things that makes listening to music fun and interesting. -Callie",

Take a creative writing class if you can! Keep a journal and record uncensored, messy observations while you listen to new albums. (You can always clean it up later.) Expand your appreciation for language and it becomes much easier to find interesting, unique ways to write about something as universally beloved as music. -Callie",

Coachella is great in the sense that it's huge and there's something for everyone \u2014 every stage has a unique lineup and appeal. Smaller festivals like All Things Go serve a more niche audience and can tailor their lineups accordingly. \n\nOn a personal level, I prefer a music festival that has public transportation options, like Gov Ball, Boston Calling, and Lollapalooza.

I started as a general entertainment reporter, but I've always wanted to write about music for a living. I saw a gap in Insider's coverage, pitched myself to fill it, and then worked really hard to prove it wasn't a mistake. I still have a long way to go in terms of making a name for myself as a writer, landing big names for interviews, networking within the industry, etc. But I just try to build a little every day and trust the process. I already feel so much more established and confident in my abilities than I did just two years ago, and that encourages me to keep going when I doubt myself. -Callie",

Try to explain why you love the person you love. You just do! Something about that person intrigues you, excites you, appeals to your sensibilities in a unique way. I think it's the same with music.\n\nFor pop specifically, there is a pervasive sense that it's somehow \"low brow\" or less refined than other genres. But I would argue that writing a song that has some kind of impact on such a huge number of people \u2014 makes them want to dance, to drive with the windows down, to text a link to a friend \u2014 is an incredible and rare skill. Blending the personal with the universal is no small feat. Pop music does that better than anything else. \n\nOf course, that's not to say all pop music is perfect and meaningful. There are great pop songs and bad pop songs, just like any other genre. But the label \"pop\" casts a wide net by definition, so I think the range in quality is a big larger. -Callie",

How much I enjoy a concert is super dependent on the vibe of the crowd, the set list, what I've been listening to recently, etc. Of course, everyone loves going to a concert where they love the songs and know all the lyrics, so I'm biased towards those experiences.\n\nBut in terms of performance, concept, and overall stage presence, there are definitely artists who consistently impress. Beyonc\u00e9, obviously, but of the shows I've seen post-pandemic: Halsey, Lorde, Maggie Rogers, and Tyler the Creator come to mind. Pre-pandemic, my favorite live shows I'd ever seen were probably FKA twigs and Vince Staples. -Callie",

I currently don't think genre matters too much, as long as the group or artist don't sound like they are trying to copy what's popular. I tend not to listen to genres where everything sounds too similar, I usually keep it at one or two artists or songs from a genre when it comes to country, hip hop, punk, pop.  My question is: am I wrong or am I on to something? Do I just need to be schooled more, or does it even matter? Am I being ridiculous? Maybe I shouldn't think about it so much.

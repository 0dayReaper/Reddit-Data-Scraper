Most Americans don't realize that our GDP is up to $20 trillion+, they just have a sense of whether it's getting better or worse.  The same would be true of the Scorecard.  A lot of it is channeling energy toward moving us in the right directions.",

A VAT is great because it's really hard for companies to game, if you're doing business in the US you're paying the VAT.\n\nCan't find the study now, but in Europe about half of the VAT is passed on to consumers and half is absorbed by the businesses. Even if 100% of the 10% proposed VAT gets passed on to the American consumer, only the top 6% of Americans spend more than 120k on consumer goods each year. (Meaning that only the top 6% will come out net negative getting $12k a year) So it's an overall increase in buying power guaranteed for 94% of Americans. And will be more because companies do absorb some part of the VAT\n\nMuch more info in this analysis by a UBI expert not affiliated w the campaign.\n\n[https://medium.com/ubicenter/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d8dab818bf1b](https://medium.com/ubicenter/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d8dab818bf1b)",

It has been an ongoing discussion in German politics why some things are taxed at 7% and others at 19%. Milk and mineral water are taxed at 7% - other beverages are not. If you go to McDonald's they will ask you if you wish to consume it at their premise or have it to-go. If you eat it in their restaurant they are paying 19% tax (they are providing restaurant services), if it's to-go they pay 7% (it's food). The list is endless.\n* Once the VAT is established it becomes a political vehicle. Ten, twenty, thirty years down the line someone will decide to raise VAT to balance the budget. It happened 8 times in Germany over the course of 40 years. Every increase significantly and disproportionally hits the lower income class. \n* VAT is paid for by the consumer, not split evenly between businesses and consumers. Check Apple's prices for example. Their iPhone is around 28% more expensive compared to US pre-sales-tax-prices which is largely due to our 19% VAT (+ other stuff, like a tax for cellphone manufacturers, localization efforts, etc.).",

It'll become obvious as Yang gets more coverage, but it's very exciting to watch. \n\nMy theory is the way he structures his arguments.  Normal liberal problem solving is empathy based: identify a problem because you empathize with someone who's suffering.  BLM?  Empathize with the person who's going to be shot.  LGBTQ rights?  Empathize with the person who's afraid to be themselves.  Climate change?  Empathize with the future generations.  \nConservative problem solving usually correlates with being in control, or distrusting institutions.  Higher taxes?  The government will waste the money, I'd rather spend it myself.  Gun control?  We need to trust the law of the constitution, and I don't trust the government.  Even religion probably has to do with taking control over the uncertainty of death. \n\nSo when you get to medicare, the typical liberal argument is to empathize with the people who go bankrupt from medical bills.  When [Yang was interviewed by Ben Shapiro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DHuRTvzMFw), he makes a different argument.  He sees government funded medicare as something that will give people freedoms: conservative problem solving.  It gives the freedom to leave your job or to move because most people are reluctant to leave their insurance.  It also gives more power to entrepreneurs if they don't have to insure their workers, it would boost small business and grow the GDP significantly.  \n\n\nIt's a theme that runs through most of his policies:  a conclusion that fits liberal ideologies, but with reasoning that fits conservative ideologies.  It's pretty awesome.",

I've found that people tend to care about issues that don't directly impact them if they feel like it will leave a mess for their children. \n\nThanks for the support, I love the MATH stickers too!",

There are only two countries, the US and New Zealand, that allow direct to consumer (DTC) pharmaceutical advertising with product claims.\n\n\nIn an ideal world, consumers would be knowledgeable enough and information would flow freely enough such that this practice only added information for them to make more informed decisions. But in practice, there are many negative effects from this practice.\n\n\n\n- It is often a way for certain companies to manipulate audiences and maintain an entrenched advantage, moving medicine away from being evidence based.\n\n\n\n- This practice gives pharmaceutical companies undue influence over media companies as their biggest customers. Pharmaceutical companies even have a seat on media boards if I'm not mistaken.\n\n\n\n- It becomes an arms race and diverts money away from far more important things-- [for instance, almost every top pharmaceutical company spends more on marketing than on R&amp;D, sometimes by a factor of more than 2:1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/11/big-pharmaceutical-companies-are-spending-far-more-on-marketing-than-research/). \n\n\n\nWould you disallow or regulate this practice?",

Second, what is your plan for funding the development and commercialization of the technology in order to finally reach widespread adoption of the technolgy?\n\nThank you for your time!

This is where the improved safety really comes from, and isn't restricted to a Thorium fuel cycle (which is a bit over-hyped). The reason this is important is because the world already has uranium mines and uranium as a fuel is better understood than Thorium.\n\n[https://whatisnuclear.com/msr.html](https://whatisnuclear.com/msr.html)",

They will be looking to get money to families to make us stronger and healthier.  \n\nBut the kicker is that Republicans, conservatives and libertarians don't hate the dividend.  Alaska is a deep red state and their dividend was passed by a Republican governor.  Conservatives don't dislike greater individual freedom and autonomy.  Republicans will see that it benefits rural areas and red states on the interior disproportionately - places that have gotten bombed out by automation.  Can you imagine their offices and phone lines?  Plus we don't need 65% of Congress, we just need a majority.  Cash is hard to demonize.  The Freedom Dividend will be very hard to stop after I win.",

I\u2019m sure it seemed quixotic so it took a special person to join and put their heart and soul into making the campaign what it is today.  \n\nZach and I met through Venture for America.  He worked at UBS in client philanthropy, and UBS supported Venture for America in its earliest days.  Zach had started his own non-profit so we\u2019d bonded over that.  I was an advisor to his non-profit - Suit Up (volunteersuitup.com) - that helps schoolchildren learn about business.  Zach is an entrepreneur and saw the potential for the campaign.  He has a tougher job than I do on the campaign and I appreciate him every day.  \n\nI met other team members through Venture for America too.  Muhan and Andrew Frawley.  Matt I knew through Manhattan Prep.  Carly heard me on Sam Harris.  We\u2019ve grown organically so now the campaign has all sorts of people.  It\u2019s been incredibly touching how many friends have come out to support me and my campaign, but I\u2019ll always give the most credit to the folks who quit their jobs and threw in with the upstart campaign that seemed very unlikely in the beginning.",

Basically, I think different people and different organizations have different needs.  A startup is a very different workplace than a mature company or a government agency.  It's not one-size-fits-all.

I am salaried.\n\nFactories run 24/7 (husband has on call duties at his, also salaried), hospitals run 24/7 (certain types of nurses/doctors are on call 24/7, such as our state's SANE nurses), companies providing dev ops, public relations managers, etc. So many industries require 24/7 support from salaried workers, so I'm also interested in how the workload could be better mitigated while not breaking the companies'/agencies' backs monetarily.",

A chart I put together using BLS.gov data eludes to this fact: https://i.imgur.com/61QRLKL.png Just 2% of the workforce, concentrated in tech \u2014 computers, semi conductors, software mainly \u2014 is responsible for just about all of the productivity growth since 1980. 40% of the workforce, mainly retail and wholesale trade and restaurant workers, have seen hardly any gains in productivity since 1980.\n\n**Do you think it\u2019s worth addressing this fact on  a debate stage?** I think many Americans are disillusioned by the gap in productivity and wages. Many are convinced it\u2019s exploitive corporations, when the truth is a single computer scientist can produce more output than 100 warehouse workers. I think many Americans are preoccupied with low unemployment numbers, and don\u2019t see that labor force participation is at its lowest level since 1980. \n\nThis feels a lot like the housing crash in 08. The numbers and facts are right in front of our eyes, but everyone seems to be ignoring this reality.",

The rampant human rights abuses of China. I know you've mentioned you want to work with them. But as we've known for over a decade and as the UN tribunal recently reported, china is holding millions of religious prisoners, Falung Gong and Uighur Muslims, captive in concentration camps and murdering them on demand to harvest their organs for profit. This is genocide. It is no exaggeration to compare their actions to those of the Nazis. Meanwhile the US has normal relations with them and they profit greatly off of access to our markets. I can't help but feel as an American that I'm tacitly supporting a genocide, and I'm disgusted.\n\nAs president, what specific steps will you take to force China to end this repugnant genocide?\n\nEdit: While I really appreciated the answer, and I'm thrilled to have directly communicated with a politican I greatly admire and who I will definitely be voting for, I wish that it had included an unequivocal declaration that China is committing genocide and we intend to stop it. Having researched the Rwandan Genocide, it was painful to see US officials dance around that incredibly powerful word. Please Chief, put your foot down here and use the word that correctly describes their action. Millions of people in China are currently imprisoned without light, without hope, they need America to be the shining city on the hill that it was born to be.",

The only way to influence their policies is to speak to one of these goals.  \n\nThe United States has a key role in maintaining China's economic growth.  The best way to improve their treatment of various groups is to make it clear that doing so is vital to maintaining their continued economic trajectory.  It will take a combination of both sticks and carrots.  To me, the US and China having at least some form of relationship will be crucial to address not just human rights issues but also climate change, AI, North Korea and other vital concerns.  Managing the relationship will be one of my top priorities.",

As a conservative you seem like one of the only person on the other side of the aisle that is actually worth listening to and has concrete plans that I could see myself getting behind. I have heard from many other people on the right who could see voting for you. Do you think that the support from some Republicans hurts you as the it seems the Democratic party moves further to the left?",

It's a bad thing when people think that if someone else likes a candidate that means you shouldn't.  I personally don't think that happens as much as one might think.  Most people will make up their own minds and listen more to their friends and family than the commentariat.  This is the campaign of common sense and I believe it will bring the country together.",

It\u2019s not very glamorous, but I think the biggest hurdle all the shows\u2014 especially the props departments :) \u2014 face is often storage-related: we do a LOT of shows with a lot of consumables (one-and-done use)! You mentioned ponchos, but there\u2019s also bulk orders of Twinkies, freight pallets of Cap\u2019n Crunch, and enough paint to put your local craft store out of business!\n\n- Carly",

Our initial audition is an acting audition where we work with people for about 30 minutes per group. We walk performers through a couple different non-verbal exercises to see how comfortable they are with non-verbal storytelling, taking notes and having fun. It's an unusual audition process but one that really helps us get a sense of who each person is and what they might bring to the role that is unique.  The initial acting auditions is followed by two-day callbacks and quick drumming assessment.   \n\n\nWe cast a pretty wide net and see hundreds of people every year for the initial audition.\n\n\\-Tascha",

In addition to the blue makeup they also handle a surprisingly large amount of costumes for the different acts and are constantly altering and mending as the show goes on because the performance is quite hard to fabrics. Plus the blue makeup is tenacious so they also travel with their own washing machines and dryers and there is a strict washing schedule during the show so that things are cleaned and ready for next use.",

Anything new that we should keep our eyes out for within the next year or so?\n\nTwo - One of my favorite things about the band is the experimentation with what can be an instrument. Since the release of THREE, are there any particular sounds that you've discovered in the last seven years that you're very pleased with, that album listeners haven't heard yet?",

A theater tech approached me before the show (I'm assuming it was based on my seat, which was at the edge of the back row) and ask if I'd like to be part of the show. I agreed and partway through the performance someone guided me backstage and positioned me under a table. Next thing I knew an object was removed from my head and I could see the audience cheering. I was later told that my head popped out of a cake or something.\n\nEdit--My head popped out of a jello mold, not a cake",

You guys brought me up on stage to do games and put a wig and cape on me \ud83d\ude02 no phones we\u2019re aloud during the show but I was wondering by the off chance you guys have the videos I would love to have them because it\u2019s such a good memory I\u2019ll never forget! Another question why the color blue?",

            "comment": "Hey all! Blue Man Group has been a huge influence and inspiration to me as a theatrical and concert lighting designer ever since I first saw the show in NYC back in 2001. I've even had the pleasure of working backstage on your touring show 3 times! The mantra of \"follow your bliss\" along with the symbol of the complex album will be a tattoo I get very soon. \n\nMy question is regarding the change from  the original ending finale (the KLF paper one) to the current one. That original finale is still to this day one of the most mind blowing and incredible live experiences I've ever been a part of. Why was the overall ending sequence changed? Was it a music rights issue with the KLF? (which I'm curious what their thoughts are on BMG using their music) was it a waste thing either the amount of paper used nightly, or was it just time to do something new? The visual of tubes going all over the place, paper waterfalls over your head in blacklists and Strobes with acid house playing loudly is very unique.\n\nThank you all for everything! Taking my fiancee to see you guys in Vegas this November for her first BMG experience!",

We're glad you loved KLF and we'll hope you'll like what we come up with next.\n\nPaper is back! We still use recycled paper for our finale that we in turn recycle. We love the experience and agree its something we're not quite ready to let go of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo thank YOU! Lets see that tat when you get it done!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLove,\n\nDustin",

So the range is probably anywhere from 3 months from initial audition to finishing training, to 18 months or longer if someone needs to learn how to drum.  Sometimes we get performers who don't know how to drum but pick it up very fast - and can move through the process in less than a year. \n\nTascha",

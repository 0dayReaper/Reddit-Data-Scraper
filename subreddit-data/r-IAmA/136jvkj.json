We answer about 3 listener questions each show and just published our 278th show, so that's probably (counts on fingers and toes) like over 800 questions! But new topics are coming in all the time and one of the things we most love is the questions are very situation based, so even if two are about anxiety they will be about anxiety in different ways, which really gives listeners the chance to relate to specific ways. \n\nWe also do topical deep dives on our Patreon ([Patreon.com/Therapy](https://Patreon.com/Therapy)) which gives us the chance to take on topics in a bigger way. We recently published a 6 hour series on ADHD and got into the weeds of the history of the diagnosis since DSM 1, the anatomy of the brain, how therapists assess and treat, and why we are seeing a huge surge of new diagnoses. \n\nAll of this is to say that when things come up that we want to cover, we get a chance to cover them and publish content on them, but we are always looking forward to new questions and are sure to get something we've never talked about every week!",

                    "comment": "This is a great question that so many people relate to. \n\nFirst, its not inherently bad to get a sense of our selves from the perspectives of others. Humans are social animals, we value community and its normal for us to want to please others and desire their approval. \n\nHowever, as you've realized, this often becomes toxic to us. Maybe the people we look to for approval will never give it, can't give it, or have a myopic view of reality and we shouldn't trust their judgement of us in the first place. Maybe people around us see our conspicuous flaws and fail to be curious or interest in who we really are. Or maybe we are just surrounded by assholes. \n\nHere are some things I'd like you to do. (1) Get a list of personality description words from the internet. Look through that list and circle as many positive qualities about yourself as you can find which you relate to. Then reflect on each of the words your circled, recalling memories and experiences you've had which you feel exemplify that word. Make it a ritual in your life to review your day, your week, your month and your year through the lens of what your personal goals for yourself were, where you've grown as a person, and what you are proud of. Part of how we let go of the voices of others is to consciously hear our own voice, so we have to make this a practice in your life. (2) While its natural to seek validation from others, we often do so in a passive way that is unsatisfying. We are \\*hoping\\* somebody will thank us, compliment us or affirm us. We post online that we are sad or feeling down to fish for some positive feedback (which isn't wrong to do). But a better way is to approach a few quality people in your life from time to time and tell them that you need a reminder of what they like about you, or admire in you, and ask if that is something they can take a moment to give you. I like being direct and honest about what we need from others because it gives them an opportunity to think about it and get closer to providing what we need. \n\nGreat questions friend, good for you for taking this on and realizing that you are enough just the way you are!",

It uses the fundamental principles of CBT - identifying the meaning we give events in our lives, challenging our perspectives and giving ourselves permission to find the truth - but it also incorporates techniques from mindfulness and meditation. \n\nResearch is always showing us how new theories and approaches are making headway with various populations of people, and ACT is showing some great results in some populations that might be less responsive to CBT. ACT's focus on positive values and accepting the presence of discomfort can be transformative. \n\nIn the end, every psychotherapy approach is better than placebo, but ACT has some great tools that many people are benefitting from!",

It seems like meeting with friends became so \"serious\". We either talk (a lot) about problems that need to be solved, some relationship drama or stress at work. I'm usually the one asking to do fun stuff like activities outside, play games, go to the cinema, but no ones really up for that anymore. Everyone is so absorbed with their jobs, always exhausted and there is always something to complain about. I have the impression it got worse since covid. I'm also very tired of always making plans which are cancelled the last minute and somehow feel like \"giving up\" on friendship. Do you know these feelings? Is it somehow my generation, is it age, is it me?",

It seems like we get asked this more in the past 2 years, but I can't say for certain. \n\nI like you suggesting fun things to do, and making your time together based around an activity. It can lighten the mood. However, I also understand that that's not for everyone. As we get older, we become less active. It also sounds like some of your friends are dealing with a lot of stress in their home and personal lives. Getting active is probably one of the best things they could do, but when we are feeling stressed and depressed, doing something like playing a game starts to feel like a chore. \n\nYou might just be at a different place in your life. Don't give up on friendships, but instead be open to fostering new friendships. If you enjoy things like playing games, going to movies, engaging in outdoor activities, Keep Doing It!  Look for social groups in your area that are based around activities, and look for ways to get involved. You can still keep your friends and meet up with them for coffee (or whatever it is that they like to do) while not feeling like you're holding yourself back. \n\nBest of Luck, \n\nNick",

There is a lot we can learn from more experienced clinicians. Keep an open mind throughout your career and never stop learning.  2) Remember that everyone is struggling with something. Keeping that in mind can be useful when we find ourselves dealing with a hostile or verbally aggressive client. 3) Find a good self-care routine. Learn to separate your work life from your personal life. Be able to check-in with yourself and process your own thoughts and emotions at the end of your work day before heading home. Doing so can be the difference between someone who has a fulfilling career as a therapist versus someone who needs to find another line of work after a couple of years.  Lastly, 4) when you feel scared, when you feel stuck and you're not sure what to do, your fallback position is always that of a cheerleader. Find some success the client has had, no matter how small, and fan those flames. \n\nBest of luck to you! \n\nNick",

                    "comment": "Welcome to the profession! \n\nIn our show we often offer advice to new therapists or point out common mistakes when we answer listener questions. Here are a few things I'm preaching to new therapists these days: \n\n1. Avoid value imposition. Every ethical code, every theory founder, and every state's laws specifically forbid a therapist from imposing their values beliefs or attitudes on the patient. However, in modern culture we have seen a dangerous trend of therapists feeling comfortable teaching their patients a political worldview or moral philosophy, believing that the greater challenges of society are so intertwined with mental health that as therapists we have an obligation to teach our patients whats right and wrong in the world to help heal them. New therapists are being influenced by social media voices with hundreds of thousands of followers who (spoiler alert) have more experience in social media than in the therapy chair. These outsized voices are influencing new therapists to impose their values, which is not good. \n2. Avoid hyper diagnosis. New therapists coming out of grad school are often in a \"case study\" mentality. They are scanning all the clues and hints they hear in therapy looking for the diagnosis code as if there is going to be an exam after the session. But part of being an effective therapist is seeing the humanity in your patient, not their diagnosis. Carl Rogers said it best \u201cWe have come to recognize that if we can provide an understanding of the way the client seems to himself at this moment, he can do the rest. The therapist must lay aside his preoccupation with diagnosis and his diagnostic shrewdness, must discard his tendency to make professional evaluations, must cease his endeavors to formulate an accurate prognosis, must give up the temptation subtly to guide the individual, and must concentrate on one purpose only; that of providing deep understanding and acceptance of the attitudes consciously held at this moment.\u201d (Client Centered Therapy: Its Current Practice Implications and Theory, 1951, pg 30) \n3. Focus on connection. If you can provide a genuine connection with a patient where they feel unlimited positive regard, safety and freedom from judgement or scrutiny, and experience you as a curious and empathic listener, your patient will become to access and unlock parts of their human experience that they never have before. Healing happens when we can create the conditions of relationship that facilitate healing. It isn't a theory, it isn't a list of techniques, its a connection. Again the great Carl Rogers said \u201cIf I can provide a certain type of relationship, the other person will discover within himself the capacity to use that relationship for growth, and change and personal development will occur\u201d (On Becoming a Person: A Therapist\u2019s View of Psychotherapy, 1961)",

We expect this, and call them \"themes\". In a sense this repetition is very important to a therapist because it gives us chances to develop insight for the patient into their patterns, notice when change is occurring and stimulate new solutions to familiar realities. \n\nBut speaking for myself (Jim) I never get bored with my patients. I'm one of those people who will be on the edge of my seat to find out what you had for lunch or how you slept last night lol. I realize that not everything a patient says is important, but my patients never bore me. \n\nHaving said that its ok if other therapists reading your question do feel bored sometimes. We are human beings after all. Even your dog, who probably thinks your the most interesting thing in the universe, probably loses interest in you every once in a while in favor of a chew toy or something lol.",

TikTok and Reddit seem to be my default screens on my phone, and I can find myself opening my phone seconds after closing it to \"check again\" or ending up on a long spiral of up swipes where an hour can pass without my noticing. \n\nSocial media \"addiction\" is absolutely a reality, and in many ways none of us should be surprised. The people who made this billion-dollar websites are very smart and designed them specifically to give humans dopamine bursts every time we use them. Our brains will naturally seek these bursts like a moth to a flame, and since we haven't evolved since our caveman days we don't exactly know how to stop accessing something (food, drugs, alcohol, love, Tik Tok) when its becoming unhealthy for us. \n\nWe've seen people have success by starting with a social media \"detox\". Deleting the apps from their phone for a week and giving their brain time to just get back to the duldrum slow reality of meat space. After that using your phone screen time limits \\*can\\* be helpful, though for me it just becomes one more screen I click through to get to the goodies. \n\nIn the end, most people don't want to quit social media, they just want to get their use under control. Physically disconnecting the apps from your devices for a solid week is a great way to recalibrate your brain's neural circuitry and give you a chance to return to the apps with less of a compulsive pattern.",

They need to be constantly encouraged and reminded that they \"are the expert in the room\" and that if they default to their training the patient will be ok. \n\nThe most important thing I want an intern to learn are the Common Factors (the qualities of effective therapy) with a focus on Carl Rogers Person Centered approaches. New Therapists need to develop those \"chair skills\" of unlimited positive regard, deep interpersonal understanding, and becoming a human mirror for the patient to have an experience they simply cannot have with others. \n\nSupervisors have a lot of influence over this, and I think we need to make sure we demonstrate it and simulate it with our interns so they can \\*feel\\* the experience. Interns often struggle with being \"book smart\" for a while and they need to get that intuitive feel of therapy. Simulating that with them is a huge help to launching their career!",

People are exploring new ways of love as they try to find what is an authentic fit for them, which overall is a good thing, but as is always the case with love and relationships there will be challenges. \n\nAt this point I haven't seen hard data arguing for or against the \"health\" or polyamory, polygamy, or monogamy. I will say that when I see strife and emotional suffering in relationships of any type it often has to do with poor communication and a lack of needs communication. There is a book I've recommended to people exploring polyamory, open relationships and related things called \"The Ethical Slut\" by Dossie Easton and Janet Hardy. In my experience one of the biggest challenges of that lifestyle is feeling that all the relationship members feel heard, seen, validated and understood. Sometimes when humans lack a commitment that might come with an exclusive relationship they feel afraid and insecure, so poly relationships need to make it a priority to create space for validation and support. \n\nIn fairness to your parents, I don't think they are out of touch or merely traditionalist. While marriage as an institution has roots in patriarchy and property management, it isn't inaccurate to say that humans often like to be exclusive with a partner and tend to pair off more often than they poly off (new phrase lol). I would encourage you to seek what's authentic for yourself, you may find in some cases that a monogamous relationship is a better fit for some aspects of your life, or for the goals you want in a relationship overall, though you are still in your heart a poly person. Its ok to be two things but choose to live in one way as it serves you best. \n\nGood luck on your journey and thanks for the question!",

Medicare, the VA, the DOD and other Federal Insurances need to recognize all licensed mental health providers, not just Psychologists and Social Workers. They are missing out on enormous portions of the workforce, and are restricting important funding from good providers. \n2. Medicare needs to provide General Medical Education funding so Psychotherapy disciplines can create Fellowships similar to what surgeons have. We struggle in this profession to train new interns in an affordable and effective way, the mental healthcare system is not adequately funded and needs the same support other healthcare disciplines get. \n3. Advocate for and encourage an interstate compact allowing licensed providers to practice over state lines. Its 2023, the internet is the primary mode of commerce and face becoming the primary mode of outpatient health. \n4. Enforcement of the Mental Health Parity Act. Insurances ROUTINELY don't pay mental health providers a living wage, steal back funds, deny their enrollment in networks, use administrative delay tactics to starve us from our paychecks, or just generally use red tape to stop us from treating because they know we are too small to do anything about it. But the penalties for breaking the law are MINIMAL. I often compare what insurance companies do to parking in a handicap spot instead of paying for parking at a special event. Its cheaper for them to break the rules and MAYBE pay the fine than do things correctly. Until the federal government is willing to punish insurances for their illegal behavior, it just makes economic sense for them to keep doing it. \n5. Forgive student loans for mental health providers. We have a special crisis in the USA, and if we don't ease the economic burden one way or another (force insurances to pay realistic rates and stop breaking the law, or give special loan terms/forgiveness to mental health providers) we are going to continue to see too few professionals coming into or staying in the field. The hard truth is that it takes 7 years of school and 3 years post graduate training to become a therapist, the cost of entry is VERY high and the system does not properly reimburse. If the government can't fix the \"free market\" insurance stuff, they can at a minimum grant a general forgiveness with generous terms to licensed providers.",

The Mental Health system generally is an enigma to most people and there are all sorts of barriers to entry. Then the costs can be annoying and unpredictable, the services can get interrupted, and this whole thing does a poor job of serving a person who is already inherently discouraged and struggling. \n\nWe made a blog post this morning on how to find a therapist, and include information on low cost and no cost therapy options. You can read it here: [https://www.tumblr.com/podtherapy/716312595828817920/how-to-find-a-therapist?source=share](https://www.tumblr.com/podtherapy/716312595828817920/how-to-find-a-therapist?source=share) \n\nBut I'm also going to post it in this thread because I think it will be helpful: \n\nHow to Find a Therapist:\n\nWill you be paying out of pocket?\r  \n1. Search Yelp, Google or Psychology Today to find therapists in your area. All therapists take out of pocket patients, pick whoever you like. \r  \n\r  \n2. Don\u2019t be afraid to use telehealth therapists, most people say they find it to be very natural and easy to use. \r  \n\r  \nDo you have insurance? \r  \n1. You may have a phone number on the back of your insurance card to call for mental health care. \r  \n\r  \n2. Go to your insurance\u2019s website and download the \u201cprovider list\u201d for mental health. Start googling the names of providers and see if any of them are a good fit. \r  \n\r  \n3. Go to Psychology Today and search for therapists by Zip code, filter those results by your insurance. You can also filter by specialties, but keep in mind most therapists are competent to treat most things and will tell you if they aren\u2019t, so don\u2019t over think it. \r  \n\r  \n4. Websites like Alma, American Well, Live Health Online, and others may be able to use your insurance and connect you easily with a therapist. \r  \n\r  \n5.   If you have your state\u2019s insurance (Medicaid etc) then contact them for the provider list or search Psychology Today. It isn\u2019t the case that Medicaid therapists are lesser in quality, the same therapists take multiple forms of insurance. \r  \n\r  \nAre you or your spouse/parent employed?\r  \n1. Contact your Human Resources department and ask if your company has an \u201cEmployee Assistance Program\u201d (EAP). You may receive access to a therapist completely independent of insurance. \r  \n\r  \nUninsured and Unemployed?\r  \n1. Search therapists in your area and look for \u201cInterns\u201d or \u201cAssociate\u201d therapists. Many therapists are in their \u201cIntern\u201d years, this is sort of like a learners permit, they are practicing therapy under the supervision of a master therapist. These are great lower rate options. \r  \n\r  \n2.

As research continues, we're seeing the link between exercise and mental health become stronger. \n\nTo examine the question, let's look at the extreme case of an eating disorder (with someone who has an obsession with exercise), the problem has to do with self-image. Exercise may be the mechanism they use to get there, but I wouldn't say it was the exercise that caused the problem. \n\nSo, can someone be so obsessed with physical health that it is a detriment to mental health?  Absolutely. However, I feel like the issue may be the \"Obsession\" part, and not the physical health. We should spend some time looking at what's driving the obsession. \n\nHope that helps, \n\nNick",

Infidelity is one of those things that happens a lot in our society, the majority of people have experienced it to some extent, but that doesn't negate how traumatic the experience is for us. Being cheated on, or being effected as a family member, can have life long effects on our ability to trust other people, value ourselves, or feel safe in relationships. Jealousy, anxiety and relationship self-sabotage are also common consequences when we've experienced infidelity. \n\nI think describing this as a trauma is really the right perspective. Which means I also think that the path toward healing from the trauma is similar to what we'd recommend for other survivors. There are multiple therapeutic approaches, but most of them rely on intentionally and carefully reprocessing the events, the feelings the visceral unconscious realities we experienced throughout the process and as a result of it. Some more advanced techniques (like EMDR or Brain Spotting) might even incorporate techniques to help mitigate the pain of these memories while you are sharing them. \n\nIn the end I believe that experiencing infidelity - and often even perpetrating infidelity - can have long term effects on a person. However, if they are living with constant flashes of pain, memories, or regular emotional confusion related to those past events I would encourage them to speak to a therapist and do some trauma work.",

I took my car in for an oil change once and didn't care for the mechanic, but that wasn't the last time my car was ever serviced.

But if the service is needed, we need to find someone we like to perform the service. \n\nI've had people in my life express the same thing.

Thanks for listening and SO GLAD to hear we influenced you taking that first step into therapy! \n\nSo, support groups have an important role in the helping ecosystem. Like you said they are often affordable (or free), they are usually easy to find and get started with, and its a great place to meet other people who relate to what you're going through. Importantly, it can be a first try at language your personal experience, and it can give you valuable insight as you hear what others are going through. \n\nBut sure, support groups can also be a drag at times. Its not uncommon for a person to visit Alcoholics Anonymous and say \"that group made me want to drink more than ever!\" or to go to a depression group and leave feeling \\*more\\* depressed than when you went in. As a therapist I usually take those groups and my patient's participation in them on a case by case basis. Usually, Im a fan of people having the experience because Id rather them have SOMEBODY to talk to and at a minimum normalize their their experience. But I also realize that it isn't easy to be among sick people who are sharing about their sickness, even if you can relate. \n\nI do think that groups do help people overall. By the way, if anybody out there is looking for mental health support groups we recommend looking up your local chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)",

                    "comment": "(Jim Here) So first off, you are a good person and Im glad you exist. Its easy to dismiss when people talk of suicide because we aren't sure how to help or when to take it seriously. Here are a few things I'd want your family members to know:\n\n1. Take any talk of suicide seriously. That means that when somebody openly says they are thinking about it we need to sit with them and talk through it. Don't be dismissive of it, don't just assume it will go away. \n2. If your Sister In Law is not already scheduled to see a therapist, or at minimum her doctor, that needs to be a priority. Your family should be encouraging, insisting, facilitating, and if needed driving her directly to appointments to make sure she has been evaluated and a plan is in place. \n3. Listen, hear and understand. If a depressed person is talking about their feelings, that's huge. It might hard to listen to, its tempting to want to correct every poor perspective the person might have, but just giving them space to language their emotions is a big step in them becoming more resilient. They are metabolizing those feelings by talking through them, and even if we just listen with sincerity and agree that what they are feeling is awful, it makes a big difference. \n4. If you haven't already, make sure your Sister in Law has information about the suicide hotline. You can call or text 988 and a real person will reply. These crisis counselors are trained and will listen to what's going on and point you toward good resources, they aren't going to send the cops or do anything rash, they know how to handle the situation. \n\nNow, let's talk about suicidal thinking for a moment. Many people are unsure how to measure suicidal thinking, so I want to teach you how therapists think about it. Again, we take all talk of suicide seriously, and we want your Sister in Law to see a professional as soon as possible, but here is a way of thinking about suicide severity. \n\nWe use the metaphor of a baseball diamond. The further along the bases the patient gets, the more in danger they are the more intervention may be needed. \n\nFirst Base - This is when a person just has thoughts of death. They are feeling sadness, loneliness, despair, hopelessness, worthlessness, fatigue and other general loss of joy. They think about dying sometimes. They don't have a plan, they don't exactly how they would hurt themselves, but them sometimes imagine dying as an escape from what they are feeling or a solution to their troubles. At this base a therapist wants to listen, get the person to language their experience, start to help them (slowly) challenge these feelings and replace them with facts, but we aren't panicking. First base is a very common place that many humans - depressed or not - may find themselves one day. \n\nSecond Base - This is when a person is not just thinking about death, but is starting to think about HOW they would do it. The actual way they might end their life. They don't have a plan, they haven't started writing goodbye letters or giving things away. But they have started contemplating practical ways to end their lives, maybe even doing research. Here a therapist is still interested in working with the patient to talk through their experience, we want to make a safety plan with them so they can easily recognize when and how they are to take action to protect themselves, and we want them to start having some accountability in monitoring what they are experiencing. If they aren't already on medication, we want to talk about this too. \n\nThird Base - This is when a person is not just thinking about death, not just consider practical methods of suicide, they are now making a PLAN. They are thinking about the when, the where, and the how. They might even start saying goodbyes to people, write letters, giving things away. As they have progressed through the bases they may have become increasingly wreckless, using alcohol or drugs to self medicate, which can make them very unstable and difficult to control. When a person reaches third base a therapist is interested in protecting them. Its time to talk about being admitted to an inpatient program and making a plan for safety that doesn't rely on the patient's will power to make good choices. \n\nStealing Home - When a patient starts toward Home Plate that means they are in danger. Here there is only one solution: admitting them into inpatient care. We need to stabilize them long enough to slow this process down and get them help. \n\nHaving said the above there are also some important red flags to watch for which can increase the danger of suicide, causing a person to quickly round the bases. \n\nRed Flags:\n\n1. Using Drugs or Alcohol excessively. This can include addictive prescription drugs like Xanax or Adderall, pain killers, and yes marijuana (even if people say these things are helping, using them to excess is a warning sign that they could hurt themselves). \n2. Risk taking behavior. Sex with strangers, gambling, adrenaline seeking, poor self care, all of this can mean a person is starting to give up. \n3. Social isolation. Suicide likes solitude. Depressed people often withdraw from others for multiple reasons, but this can be a red flag because we lose sight on where the person is in their baseball diamond, and the voice of depression becomes dominant in their mind. \n4. Firearms. 51% of suicides in America happen with a gun. If a person is feeling depressed they should IMMEDIATELY ask a friend or family member to take their firearms for a while until the person is ready to have them back. Another organization to know about is Hold My guns ([https://www.holdmyguns.org/](https://www.holdmyguns.org/)) a charity that will help you find a safe and professional gun store to take custody of your weapons while you recuperate. Guns in the home are one of the greatest risk factors for a person experiencing depression and suicidality and must be taken seriously. \n\nThanks for this question friend, I hope you Sister in Law feels better soon and Im glad you are in her life to help.",

I realize that depression has a sliding scale of severity, and that we might suspect that loved ones are overreacting to our situation, but I'm happy you chose to be proactive and preventative with your depressive symptoms. Taking medicine can be a very personal decision, but its important to keep in mind that if our healthcare providers are recommending this its probably a good idea. \n\nNow lets talk about your partner. First, I get the frustration. If one member of a relationship is a chain smoker but gets upset at you for vaping it can feel like there is a inequality that must be addressed. However, I would point out that the nature of mental health is a uniquely personal experience. Anxiety is one of those things that people are sometimes afraid to deal with because they dislike the experience so much that when it isn't happening they'd rather not think of it at all. I'm glad you've encouraged your partner to deal with their anxiety and have been supporting them, but I know its hard to watch somebody suffer (and, honestly to suffer along side them) and not see them get help. \n\nOne idea could be asking them to go to a mental health support group \\*with\\* you. Afterall, your partner seems very interested in your mental health and insistent that you take action. Perhaps you could look up a local NAMI Support group, or see if a local therapist's office is doing any kind of special groups for general mental health support. Maybe they'd be more likely to come \\*for you\\* rather than for themselves. \n\nThis is actually how alot of people get their partners interested in going to therapy. They will invite their partner to come to a session and meet their therapist so the therapist can gather more info on the patient. The partner is treated as an \"expert witness\" who can teach us about the patient. But after getting a feel for what happens in therapy, the partner often feels comfortable trying it for themselves. \n\nLast suggestion: Listen to Pod Therapy! That's the whole reason we created the show! Maybe find some episodes that speak to your spouse's experience and put them on during your next road trip. If your partner can tolerate our bullshit long enough to get something from the message they might just find that therapy is more approachable for them than they realized!",

With the advent of telehealth we've gotten a lot better at treating this population, and I know in my own practice (Jim) I've treated way more of these patients in the past 3 years than ever in my career. Unfortunately the reason behind the failure has to do with the healthcare system not making special exceptions for particular issues. Insurances and their lobbyists force state legislatures to write laws limiting care anywhere they can, and they HATE telehealth because it means more people get help which costs them money. Agoraphobia doesn't get special treatment, it just gets put in the bin of mental health generally. HOWEVER the good news is that as I said telehealth has really opened up treatment for this population. \n\nYes, in my opinion, agoraphobia is rising. We saw a unique version of it emerge during the covid crisis that was difficult to diagnose because we all had good reasons not to socialize or leave our homes. The after effect of the pandemic is that much agoraphobia has been untreated or unrecognized, and many more people found themselves entering that isolated avoidant pattern without anybody in their lives growing concerned. The work from home movement has also accidentally facilitated this as a person can now choose agoraphobia as an entire lifestyle without many consequences. You can have food delivered, work from your home computer, date online and play video games with friends and nobody would think you have a problem. \n\nWe did an episode during covid about agoraphobia which might not resonate as much today ([https://podtherapy.tumblr.com/post/660562525468917760/190-covid-agoraphobia-wife-attracted-to-female](https://podtherapy.tumblr.com/post/660562525468917760/190-covid-agoraphobia-wife-attracted-to-female)) We are overdue to talk about this, submit a question we'd love to discuss it! \n\nRe: Disability/SSI - The process is meant to be difficult in part to dissuade people from accessing it too easily and without merit. Of course, this is sort of cruel to those who actually suffer because of course they will struggle to complete the process. Most states have a social service program with helpers who can assist in navigating the application process and support you in knowing what to answer and where. Another option is to contact a disability lawyer, they will take a cut of your owed pay (the government technically owes you starting from when you apply to when you get your first check, often resulting in a big check to start). \n\nRe: ADHD Meds for Anxiety - The relationship of any med to any condition is very complex, and this is a big reason why I like people on medicines to also be talking to a therapist for a while so we can monitor their experiences and make sure we are getting the results they need. \n\nGreat questions!",

                    "comment": "Yay! You asked the GOLDEN QUESTION! This comes up every year and is really important! \n\nWe have a blog post with links on this: [https://podtherapy.tumblr.com/post/716312595828817920/how-to-find-a-therapist](https://podtherapy.tumblr.com/post/716312595828817920/how-to-find-a-therapist)\n\nBut here is a summary: \n\n**Will you be paying out of pocket?**\r  \n\r  \n1. Search Yelp, Google or Psychology Today to find therapists in your area. All therapists take out of pocket patients, pick whoever you like.\r  \n\r  \n2. Don\u2019t be afraid to use telehealth therapists, most people say they find it to be very natural and easy to use. \r  \n\r  \n**Do you have insurance?**\r  \n\r  \n1. You may have a phone number on the back of your insurance card to call for mental health care.\r  \n\r  \n2. Go to your insurance\u2019s website and download the \u201cprovider list\u201d for mental health. Start googling the names of providers and see if any of them are a good fit.\r  \n\r  \n3. Go to Psychology Today and search for therapists by Zip code, filter those results by your insurance. You can also filter by specialties, but keep in mind most therapists are competent to treat most things and will tell you if they aren\u2019t, so don\u2019t over think it.\r  \n\r  \n4. Websites like Alma, American Well, Live Health Online, and others may be able to use your insurance and connect you easily with a therapist. \r  \n\r  \n5.  If you have your state\u2019s insurance (Medicaid etc) then contact them for the provider list or search Psychology Today. It isn\u2019t the case that Medicaid therapists are lesser in quality, the same therapists take multiple forms of insurance. \r  \n\r  \n**Are you or your spouse/parent employed?**\r  \n\r  \n1. Contact your Human Resources department and ask if your company has an \u201cEmployee Assistance Program\u201d (EAP). You may receive access to a therapist completely independent of insurance.\r  \n\r  \n**Uninsured and Unemployed?**\r  \n\r  \n1. Search therapists in your area and look for \u201cInterns\u201d or \u201cAssociate\u201d therapists. Many therapists are in their \u201cIntern\u201d years, this is sort of like a learners permit, they are practicing therapy under the supervision of a master therapist. These are great lower rate options. \r  \n\r  \n2. You can also contact therapists and ask if they have a \u201csliding scale\u201d, this means they will charge some patients less if there is a financial difficulty.\r  \n\r  \n3. Contact your state Colleges and Universities, ask if they have a program where graduate students practice counseling. These are usually nearly free for patients and exist so therapy students can get hands on experience.\r  \n\r  \n4. Are you religious? Contact your church and ask if they have any options. Often religious institutions have lists of professional therapists they partner with and are happy to pay the bill for. \r  \n\r  \n5. There are websites that create low rate directories of therapists like Open Path\r  \n\r  \n**In the Military, have Tricare or part of the VA?** \r  \n\r  \n1. Look into Telemynd, a service provided to all military members families and veterans which can connect you with a mental health provider. \r  \n\r  \n2. Active duty and afraid talking to a therapist will compromise your clearance? Maybe start with couples therapy between you and your spouse. At last check, clearance forms make an exception for meeting with a therapist to talk about relationships, that might be a good place to start a conversation about how your mental health is effecting the relationship. \r  \n\r  \n**More Tips**\r  \n\r  \n1. If you contact a therapist you like and they aren\u2019t taking patients, ask them if they can recommend a therapist they respect who might have openings. \r  \n\r  \n2. Don\u2019t give up! It can take some time to find a therapist that matches your resources and needs, and then finding a therapist who is a good fit can also be \n\n**What Qualities Should I Look For In a Therapist?** \n\n1. Professionally licensed. While \"life coaches\" and \"healers\" have value in the world, there is a reason mental health is the domain of clinical professionals. When you see therapists names you will usually see some letters like PhD, LMFT, LCSW, LPC, LMHC, etc. Google what those letters mean in your state and make sure the Therapist is a licensed provider. \n\n2. Professionally oriented. Its becoming increasingly fashionable for Therapists to signal on their profile that they dabble in some mystical, political or social philosophies. On one hand there is nothing wrong with them doing that, and its helpful if you find a therapist who aligns with your personal world view. On the other hand, when a therapist presents themselves in professional, clinical ways, they more likely to carry themselves in those ways. \n\n3. Alignment. Maybe you'd feel more comfortable with somebody who looks like you, comes from the same religious background as you, has a similar gender or sexuality experience as you, has or doesn't have children, is of a certain age, etc. Its ok to look for those human factors. But don't prioritize them too highly. Like hiring a plumber, its more important that they be good at plumbing than somebody you'd like to have a beer with.",

It sounds like you're not all that optimistic about your salary suddenly doubling and this becoming your dream job, so there's no sense in delaying the inevitable. \n\nOn the positive side, the job is supporting you currently, so you're not in an emergency situation. This provides you an amazing opportunity to search out a career that you're passionate about. Sometimes people are forced to take big risks and jump full-on in a new direction. You have the ability to try things out on a part-time basis because your FT job to fall back on. Take advantage of that. Find some things your passionate about and explore what kind of a career you could create for yourself in that industry. \n\nLastly, it's never too late to learn new skills/trades. I decided, in my early 40s, to pursue a career in the fitness industry. I was able to study and start a business part-time while keeping my full-time gig as a therapist/educator. It was scary, and a lot of work, but I'm grateful I had my full-time job to take some of the pressure off. \n\nKeep a positive, optimistic attitude. \n\n\\-nick",

The vast majority of this profession are interested in your mental health, and if you say something they don't personally believe, they aren't likely to even wince at it, you'll probably never know. \n\nIn that sense, picking a therapist should be like picking a surgeon. You want somebody professionally competent who seems to want to be good at their profession. However, in therapy, it does help if the person feels approachable to you. Maybe they look visibly like somebody you'd feel comfortable talking to, maybe they appear to have some life experiences you relate to, or maybe they self identify as something that appeals to you. \n\nHowever, you're not very likely to get much from a therapist if you ask them about their worldview. If you ask who they voted for, how they feel about contemporary political situations and what not, they will probably demeure and be more interested in your perspectives on these things - as they should be. \n\nOn the other hand if you fish through profiles long enough you might find a therapist who is signaling in one way or another that they have strong political or religious views. You might find that resonate with you and makes you feel safer with them, and if so that's great. In general I don't love therapists doing that because there is an inverse relationship between being a good clinician and being an activist to your patients, regardless of whether the patient agrees with you politically. \n\nGenerally if you look long enough you'll find somebody that fits you, but I encourage you to look for a person of skill and approachability over worldview match, you'd rather have a good therapist than one you'd have a beer with, but who knows you might just get both!",

If you've been seeing the provider for a while, maybe your primary challenges have changed, maybe (hopefully) you've changed, and it sometimes makes sense to find a new provider to address new concerns in your ongoing story. \n\nHowever, my first choice before changing providers is to open up a conversation with your current one about what your treatment plan is, what your goals are, and how \\*they\\* feel you are doing on progress. Sometimes as Therapists we think you're doing perfectly fine, or we think that our role in your life has become more about maintenance than actively addressing big obstacles. It helps to open up a conversation with your therapist about how your therapy is going, what items you feel you want to work on, and to get their feedback on ways you might get more traction. \n\nIn the end we want you to reach your goals! Its ok to talk to us when you feel like you've slowed down or you want to identify new problems to work on =)",

Listener of the show and love the awareness you guys bring to Mental Health. \n\nOver the last few years, I\u2019ve noticed that my spending has become a problem. I\u2019m guess you could say I have a shopping addiction. I\u2019m keep buying clothes, books, house decor, etc. that I do not need nor really have the money for. It has gotten out of control the last couple of months. I have a credit card that my significant other doesn\u2019t have access to, but name is on the account. They looked at their credit history recently and saw the balance bring it up to me. I panicked and broke down from the guilt. However, I am still spending on it. \n\nI want to stop this before it gets more out of control that I can\u2019t stop it. What are some helpful ways to deal with this? Should I bring this up to my current therapist? \n\nThanks for all you guys do!",

It's not too hard to recognize when a friend or family member becomes addicted to alcohol or meth, but a shopping addiction can fly under the radar for a LONG time. That means that by the time others are aware of it, the person has already put themselves in a very deep hole. \n\nWhat you're dealing with may not be at the level of an \"addiction,\" but in either case, it sounds problematic, at minimum. Let's address this snowball while it's still manageable. \n\nBring it up to your therapist, and be open to exploring some of the thoughts and emotions that are tied to the behavior. Another thing you may consider, if you're open to it is finding a Gambler's Anonymous meeting in your area. I realize you're not a gambler, but you would be welcome at that meeting, and it might be worth checking out. \n\n\\-Nick",

Sometimes, with your therapist's endorsement, this is a good way for the therapist to meet a very important person in the patient's life, and also treat them as an \"expert witness\" who can share more with the therapist about what the patient's experiences in day to day life are. This can sometimes provide both partners with better insight into what language the therapist uses and what each person is working on. Its also a good idea to ask your partner's therapist how you can be helpful and supportive, sometimes the therapist has good suggestions for you that might make it easier to talk about these things outside of sessions. \n\nOf course, most doctors recommend listening to Pod Therapy with your partner to stimulate conversation about mental health generally. Its guaranteed better than placebo!",

The use of the substance causes a physiological or psychological response (in the case of nicotine, that may look like a sense of calm/relaxation).  This is not necessarily problematic until dependence develops (which in the case of nicotine, happens quickly and relatively consistently across populations). Dependency basically means that sense of calm/relaxation is now dependent on the substance. It becomes harder for my body/mind to achieve that state naturally. Also, tolerance develops meaning that I now need to smoke more frequently to maintain that sense of calm/relaxation. \n\nWithdrawal symptoms, generally speaking, consist of the exact opposite of the physiological/psychological effects I got from using the substance. The opposite of calm/relaxed is anxiety. Which is why people are restless and irritable when they quit. The psychological part of this is also present in how I choose to deal with those symptoms. How did I deal with anxiety in the past? I smoked. So, I smoke again, making me more dependent on the nicotine, and the cycle continues.",

I\u2019m also in the Uk :)  I had always known I was differently wired, but this answered so much, and my diagnosis has enabled me to be a lot more self compassionate.\n\nI first fell down deep deep rabbit holes, learning about Autism, especially in women, who are historically under diagnosed, partially because of masking, and partially because of misconceptions about autism historically. Some good resources for me were Yo Sandy Sam on YouTube, NeuroDivers on IG. That lasted maybe 6 to 8 weeks of drinking in everything like a sponge, and feeling like I had found \u201cmy people\u201d.\n\nI then started trying to make my life more comfortable for the way my brain is wired. I acknowledged that I needed time to process things, allowed myself to discover Special Interests and indulge in them. I finally learned to rest, which has taken a long time.\n\nI got a new job, and decided to disclose my neurodivergence to work. That has been good, and I have had support through Access to Work (more for the ADHD, but you may want to look into it). I consciously unmask in my office, stimming (more tactile than verbal stims, though sometimes the verbal stims happen anyway). I also work from home 3 days a week (rather than the 2 others do), to help me manage my sensory needs and energy levels. I am a lot kinder to myself.\n\nI have also joined my workplace\u2019s enabling staff network, and I am an active part of our neurodiversity meet-ups, which are so invigorating, being around others who get me.\n\nYou may want to read Chlo\u00e9 Hayden\u2019s Different, Not Less. Great book.\n\nI hope this helps. I\u2019m an early bird, so as am off to bed with a good book now, but feel free to @ me if you have any questions.",

These are the exact challenges that lead many people to making that first appointment, and Im glad you did.\n\nAs for your first session, if I were your therapist here are things Im probably going to ask you to share about. (Btw, be prepared to do some talking, lol, this is afterall about you)\n\nIm going to ask:\n\n1. So, what brings you here today? This is a good place to describe some of the challenges you've been having lately. A good opening is to share a couple paragraphs about each area, maybe two or three bullet points each. Expect that the therapist is going to ask more about each item you list to try to understand what your experience has been like.\n2. How long has this been going on? This question invites you to help me understand what life was like without these challenges you're facing, and help me compare then to now as we've seen these problems escalate. Its also a chance for me to learn how things went from \"meh\" to \"uhg\" to \"uh oh\" to \"oh shit I need therapy\".\n3. Can you tell me more about your life? We want to learn about your \"human ecosystem\". Are you dating? What do you do for work? Do you have close friendships? Hobbies? Who do you live with? Are you facing any unique realities (legal, financial, medical, familial, relational, etc)?\n4. Can you tell me about growing up, what was your family like? We want to understand a bit about what your childhood was like. What did your family household look like? Any important changes happen in childhood? Are you close to your parents, siblings, grandparents, etc? Who in your family supports you today? Did you have a unique experience in childhood that helps me understand who you are as an adult?\n5. Have you done therapy before, or taken medicines? This is us trying to understand if you have any history that we should know about. Teenage depression? Anger management? Family counseling? Couples counseling? Anti-anxiety meds from your general doctor? Its all good to know.\n6. Is there anything I haven't asked you that you feel I should know about you? This is where you tell me if you've been abducted by aliens. That the only answer to this question, so its yes or no.\n7. What are our goals? What does success look like? This is where we get an understanding how you will know therapy has worked for you. You might say something like \"I'll have better boundaries with my family, whether they like it or not\" or \"I will have a career plan that feels fulfilling and exciting\" or \"I will know what my life is missing and I will start taking action to get those things for myself\". It can also just be as simple as \"I will be happy to be around my family\" or \"I wont cry when I get home from work\" or \"I wont feel lost anymore\". You don't have to over think it, its just a rough draft so we know what direction to help you go in.\n\nAgain, congratulations on taking this step. The good news is that when we do our lives on purpose, we get more purpose out of our lives. Im excited for you and hope you'll find the direction you're looking for!",

I agree, I don't know if a sex therapist would offer you anything better than what you have. You've got a therapist you feel comfortable with, stick with it. \n\nRegarding the anger/rage issue... First, I'll defer to your current therapist over anything I tell you. I know it sounds like a cop out, but your therapist knows more about you're specific symptoms than I do. \n\nThat being said, if I'm your therapist, I want to explore the emotions under the anger. Anger/Rage can sometimes be viewed as a secondary emotion, i.e., it can be a response to another emotion that goes unrecognized and unaddressed. As an example, you can look at Road Rage. \"Anger\" is the emotion that people will display, verbalize, and recognize, but if we dig deeper we will usually find other emotions, such as Fear (having anxiety about getting into a bad accident, or feeling like other people's behaviors are threatening your safety); Resentment (feeling like other people are getting away with breaking the law while you've been caught in the past); or feeling injured or wronged (this person did this behavior in malice with the intent of harming me).   Once we identify some of those emotions, we can start examining the belief systems that led to them and the thinking patterns that support them. \n\nHope that helps",

Regan's policies were bad, and so have been the policies of many other leaders. \n\nUnfortunately to this day the number 1 provider of mental health services in any state of the country will be the criminal justice system. Because our mental healthcare system is so disjointed and under funded (Im looking at you insurance companies) many people don't find their way into help until they've decompensated so far that they've found themselves in legal trouble. \n\nThe good news though is that we are seeing the advent of speciality courts like Mental Health Court, Drug Court, Youth Offender and Veterans Court, which have been hugely successful in creating diversion programs to rehabilitate and treat people rather than just throwing them into the system and forgetting them forever. \n\nAlso, the government did eventually make it illegal to just institutionalize a person experiencing mental illness, by that I mean keeping them in care long term with no discharge plan. The unfortunate side effect however is something called the IMD Exclusion which prevents medicaid from funding long term inpatient care for mental health, which needs to be fixed (Im looking at you Congress). \n\nThe past few administrations have made some great progress in funding drug treatment and prevention programs, especially around opioid treatment, and most states are not understanding that part of addressing mental health and substance abuse is to address their social safety nets like food and housing. I think we are heading in the right direction overall.",

When people we are close to are experiencing mental health stuff, it effects our relationship with them and we have to think carefully about what parts of their experience are their responsibility, and what is ours. \n\nWith \"triggers\" in particular this can be tricky. As a person learns more about what sets them off they will want to teach those close to them to hopefully avoid those problems. Its natural to want to help them as much as we can, but often we find that we can't possibly accommodate their every request. Also, the person has to learn the coping skills to live life on life's terms, not try to bubble wrap the world so nothing ever harms them. \n\nIf your person is seeing a therapist I think its a good idea to ask them for the therapist's opinion on this matter. If you are romantic or family with this person you might even ask if you can attend a session so the therapist can give you some feedback on how support this person, but also hear your thoughts on when \"walking on eggshells\" around this person is harming you in the relationship as well. This gives the therapist a chance to help the patient right size their expectations and start working on coping skills where they are needed. \n\nNo, you're not being selfish. Yes, you should try to help a person who is struggling by listening to them and working with them to make reasonable life changes. But in the end the person's growth is measured by their ability to function in the world around them, not change the world to suit themselves.",

What considerations do you make in providing a mental health podcast that's entertaining to your audience while still being safe and responsible?\n\n\nTo expand on my question, I think mental health content in particular can generate an \"oh shit, they're talking about me!\" response for some people. I have friends that tell me they're definitely suffering from *x*, *y*, and *z* because a youtube channel or podcast told them so. \n\n\nI saw a previous answer about neurodiverse people and how symptoms of ADHD can be so relatable that many people diagnose themselves as ADHD (which resonates with me; half my social circle now claims to be neurodiverse, including some people that... probably aren't?)\n\n\nFWIW I have been diagnosed with ADHD by a licensed psychologist, so \"fakers\" for lack of a better word may strike close to home for me.\n\n\nI'm also troubled sometimes by the way various mental health communities can become problematic echo chambers rather than channels for support and good-faith sharing of experiences (thinking of some popular subreddits here, and the lack of empathy I see there).\n\n\nWhat do you think of the risks posed by the integration of social media and entertainment products with medical topics? Obviously it's great for generating awareness... but is there any element of voyeurism/self-diagnosis/misinterpretation that concerns you about this medium over others?",

                    "comment": "Hot damn I like this question! Let me tell you friend, I think if you can get past how annoying I am on the show you'd really like our podcast! This is Jim btw, the annoying one. \n\nAnywhozzle, I love so much of what you said on here. Our project, and the community that has emerged around it, is actually a direct response to much of what you've observed in other internet mental health communities. Sure we have our bad apples - I'm probably one of them sometimes - but I'm proud of how this project has tried to teach people how to have a moderate, even handed, serious tone about mental health while also asking people to relax and not take themselves or mental health too seriously. \n\nSo lets talk about how we did that. \n\nWhen Nick and I started planning this project in Summer of 2017 we had two observations and one proposal:\n\nObservation 1: Half of the \"Mental Health Podcasts\" are a famous or funny amateur giving advice while being relatable and entertaining. \n\nObservation 2: Half of the \"Mental Health Podcasts\" are clinical experts educating the public while being credible, serious and academic. \n\nProposal: What if we found the middle of those ideas? Could we be clinical experts offering sound, practical education to the public while being entertaining, casual, and approachable? \n\nNick and I had worked together at several treatment programs throughout the years, and sometimes we'd go out for a beer after work. People might over hear us talking shop and become curious, they'd ask us what we did for a living. When we told them we were therapists they were honestly surprised. They assumed therapists were aloof, tweed jacket wearing scholars who judged you with unblinking eyes - not two assholes in sports jerseys trying to get the bar to do the wave when the game cut to commercial. \n\nWe found that people at the bar found us approachable. Because we didn't take ourselves too seriously, they felt safe talking to us. We'd get a chance to show them what talking to a therapist might feel like, and when we'd encourage them to go see one many often did now that we'd humanized the field. \n\nWe wanted to recreate that experience in a podcast. \n\nBut as you might expect, danger lurks in every corner. If we are too crass, too dude-ish or too irreverent, we lose credibility. If we are too clinical, too scholarly or too serious, we lose approachability. We had to try to find the middle. After 6 years I can tell you we haven't found it, but we try every week to get closer to it, and with the help of our audience, a comedian \"life coach\" and finally a female therapist willing to put up with us, we are helping a lot of people become willing to get help.\n\nRe: Social Media Influence over Mental Health\n\nThis is an area I rant about a lot on the show. I'm glad the world is talking about mental health. Im glad that its stigma is so weakened that now its \"cool\" to be diagnosed. But as a clinician I want people to understand that mental-illness cosplay is often hurtful to those that suffer and can have real effects on the mental healthcare system at large. \n\nIts our job as clinical educators (therapists with a podcast) to help people navigate the tricky waters of self reflection, self help and diagnostics. We are careful on the show to discourage people from self diagnosing, we are also careful on the show to always point people toward a clinical helper in their area, our job is to start a conversation about mental health and get people thinking about it. Which we've enjoyed doing the past 6 years.",

I also have a bunch of anxiety challenges and self esteem. It's all really fun stuff.\n\nSo I've been looking for a therapist through Spring Health since my insurance gives me a bunch of sessions before I have to pay out of pocket and where I live I just couldn't afford to pay out of pocket. \n\nHow do I actually pick a therapist? I end up looking through profiles and credentials and either roll my eyes at things that are written in their profiles or find myself comparing their credentials (LCSW vs LMFT. Phd, PsyD, MS, etc.), something I'm not even remotely qualified to analyze. I also compare these potential therapists to a friend of mine who is an LCSW and it kinda horrifies me that she is in a position to give anyone advice about just about anything, so I get hung up on that as well. And I have some sexual hang ups that maybe would be appropriate for a sex therapist, which Spring doesn't employ.\n\nAnyway, that's all a really long question, any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.",

There's really no way to tell by looking at credentials only. I do believe (I know, I'm biased) that most therapists are good therapists. But that doesn't mean that if you have a good therapist that that therapist is right for you. Unfortunately, I think in your case, this is going to be trial and error.

It was an issue they were dealing with because prosecuting attorneys will look at a lot of crime scene photos and hear a lot of traumatic details about violent crimes. The trauma doesn't show itself right away, or in obvious ways. Instead, it seems to accumulate and come out in the form of a Substance Use Disorder. \n\nIn this presentation, I focused heavily on the importance of a debriefing. Being able to talk to others at the end of the stressful day and express your thoughts and feelings as you went through the experience is very helpful in avoiding the cumulative effects of vicarious trauma. It doesn't need to be therapy, or have structured facilitation, per se.  Simply being able to verbalize and express your thoughts and feelings allows the brain to process the event and file it away. \n\nThat would be my #1 tip for anyone who regularly deals with 2nd hand trauma. \n\n\\-nick",

I'll take a swing at answering this as best I can from his perspective, but he may add more later. \n\nOne great piece of advice I've heard Jim say that he's used in the past is to recognize catastrophizing thoughts and challenge them.  The example used is, if you were sitting at home with the windows open and heard hooves outside walking on pavement and were not able to see anything, you're probably thinking \"a horse.\"  It's very unlikely that your brain will immediately go to \"OMG, a zebra!\" It's even more unlikely that you'd be thinking, \"I'll bet it's a unicorn!!!\"  \n\nBut that's what anxiety does. When there is a cue that triggers a thought, we can often catastrophize, and immediately think of the worse case scenario. Then we continue to replay the event in our heads to lock in that fear even more. Instead, we want to get into the habit of recognizing that thought as a thinking error. \"Do you really think it's a zebra, or is it more likely to be a horse?\"  The catastrophizing thoughts don't really go away, but with practice, they have less control over your life because you learn to recognize and challenge them. \n\n\\-nick",

Of course, both types of relationship have elements of each of those things, but bear with me a moment. \n\nSo its devastating when romantic relationships end. Its a person we were deeply vulnerable with, sexual with, and to be rejected by them or to have to let them go feels like we are losing something of value that we once possessed. It can also feel existential in the sense that we are being evaluated somehow and learning that we are not acceptable to somebody. \n\nPlatonic relationships can be very deep. Because they don't rely on sexual chemistry or relationship exclusivity they have this sense of perpetual buy-in. You aren't always just \"owed\" contact with the person because they are you \"boyfriend/girlfriend\". They have to want to be connected to you, and so when they choose you there is a sense of joy and being valued that comes from that. When a platonic relationship ends it is usually after some difficult disagreements, an erosion of the friendship over time, or silence and indifference settling in. Its a different type of rejection that a person being seduced by their new coworker. This friend who was once a wellspring of affirmation and joy in your life had decided not to be in your life anymore. This leaves an emptiness, a sense of worthlessness, and vacancy in your life where once a constant connection stood. \n\nIn the end, the pain of relationship loss is measured by the significance of that relationship to your identity and life navigation, regardless if it was sexual or not.",

They will want to ask more questions about what medicines have been tried, what therapy work has been done, and are in the best position to give you feedback about right sizing your experience and keeping in mind the longer story of what you've been through. They'll probably remind of you where you've made some progress, while also taking you seriously about why you still feel your struggling with these feelings. \n\nThere are some really exciting new clinical breakthroughs happening in the field of medicinal depression treatment. While there is also a lot of hype about some of these, the science is very encouraging and your Psychiatrist may have more information about taking some next steps. \n\nNot long ago we did a deep dive for our patreon community about the long list of depression treatments over time, and we explained how new treatments like TMS and Ketamine, along with older treatments like ECT, have shown to be effective for those with forms of depression that haven't responded to other therapies. \n\nAgain, in the end we are here as educators, we don't know your condition of what other challenges you may be working through, but I do want to encourage you to open up with your doctor about your struggle and make sure they know exactly how you feel.",

                    "comment": "Hey there! So ADHD has come up a lot in this thread, which is great because it gives us all a chance to talk about something a lot of people are thinking about lately. \n\nSo the thing I'd encourage people to think about here is the idea of \"seeking a diagnosis\", as if this will change who you are or what your experience is. A lot of people think that mental health diagnosis is the same as a medical diagnosis, but actually they work in opposite ways. Let me explain: \n\nIn gastroenterology you may show up with a stomach ache. Your symptom is stomach pain, you want to know the \\*cause\\* of that symptom, or the diagnosis. When the doctor does tests she tells you have diverticulitis, this is important because now you can know what other symptoms you might experience and how to manage this condition long term. \n\nIn mental health diagnosis works in the opposite direction. Patients arrive with a list of symptoms they are experiencing, let's say sadness and despair, loss of joy in life. We don't tell them the \\*cause\\* is \"depression\". We explain that what they are describing is called \"depression\". In mental health, a diagnosis is a description of a bundle of traits, its a short hand word used by the field to summarize the symptoms, not to explain them. \n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder isn't a cause of fear, it is the phrase we use to describe a certain style of fear. Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder isn't a \\*cause\\* of one's life experiences, it is a word we use to describe those life experiences succinctly. \n\nSocial media often presents AD/HD as something you \\*are\\*, when technically speaking it is something are \\*experiencing\\*. This is why more than 50% of children diagnosed with AD/HD eventually find remission and no longer meet the definition of the diagnosis in adulthood. \n\nNow some things, like Autism which has many similarties to AD/HD, are seen as a permanent condition which we try to help patients manage and adapt to rather than eliminate. But generally speaking mental health diagnoses are bundles of symptoms, not causes of symptoms. \n\nIt should also be noted that part of the way we define the diagnosis of AD/HD involves how much the symptoms negatively effect areas of life like work and family. Unlike many other mental health diagnoses, AD/HD often evaluates the external effect of the symptoms on other people. \n\nAnyway, if you feel this is something you'd like to look into further I encourage you to talk about it with your primary doctor. They should be able to get you a referral to a specialist who can do an evaluation.",

That talking about suicide can encourage people to acknowledge their suicidal feelings and talking about them  can keep them in check or encourage them to seek help. That mentioning suicide to a distressed individual isn't going to make the idea pop into their head.\n\nIs the difference between the two concepts one that a personalized conversation is different than a news report? Are the journalists basing their prohibition on something without a scientific basis? Are the journalists just full of themselves and their perceived power over the public's attention and actions?",

I don't know if that decision is based on any kind of scientific understanding, or if it's just a stance made by the publication for some other reason. But Yes, personalized conversation is much different. \n\nWe get a lot of questions to the show about friends/family being afraid to broach the topic of suicide for the fear of putting the idea in their head. That's just not how that works. In my years as a therapist I've never heard anyone say, \"boy, I wish I hadn't mentioned that thing about suicide.\" But what I hear all the time is, \"I wish I would have said something.\" \n\nPeople sharing their stories about their own experiences sends the message to others that they are not alone at a time when they feel most alone. It also gives hope to see that someone else was in that spot and made it out. \n\nNick",

Looking back this probably hurt me more than I could have realized at the time.... As an adult I'm highly aware, and my coworkers and boss even comment on it, that I still have ADHD and would like to get back on medication for it. What would the process be for me to get the ball rolling on that? Do I have to dig through old medical records from 20 years ago? Or would it just be easier to look into getting re-diagnosed?",

If you are in the UK or Europe, you might find the process to be daunting and highly involved. You'd need to get a referral from your general doctor, then get on a waiting list for a multi-hour evaluation, then do a long form clinical interview with further testing, then wait to be approved for the medication. A friend of mine recently went through this process and it took her almost 2 years from diagnosis to dispensing of the medication. \n\nIf you live in the United States you can talk to an online Nurse today and have the pills delivered to your house by Friday. \n\nThis is also why the diagnosis of ADHD is triple in America what the global average is, and why the ADHD medicine industry ran out of pills last year. \n\nSo the good news: its very easy to get the diagnosis and the medicine if you need it. \n\nThe bad news: its so easy that now its hard to get the medicine because of supply shortages.",

Let me make a few points:\n\nComorbidity (the double trouble of having two mental illnesses at once) is statistically high in people diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - what most people call \"neurodivergent\". Sometimes this is situational as people with ASD and ADHD struggle in social lives, work lives or in a world not quite built for them. Sometimes this is chemical as the brain may predispose them to experiencing acute sadness and low joy in life. \n\nHowever, one thing we are seeing a lot of lately are people who primarily have depression, adjustment disorder, or are going through difficult life transitions concluding that they are actually \"neurodivergent\" and seeking treatment for ADHD (stimulants) rather than addressing the depression itself. This is possibly due to the new global discussion around ADHD/ASD and especially its relatability and popularity on social media. So in some ways, the hyperinformation about these conditions is also creating a misconception about them which can also lead to some depression and neurodivergent (or perceived ADHD/ASD) crossover. \n\nIn the end, we encourage people to talk through all their experiences with a healthcare provider. The more information we can gather as helpers the more likely we will be to zoom in on the specific problems a person is facing and help them find better solutions. \n\nGreat question!",

The qualities of ADHD are extremely relatable, the diagnostic criteria have been lowered over time in more recent editions of the DSM, and social media has misinformed the public that an infinity of life challenges or thinking qualities are proof of ADHD. \n\nASD on the other hand, while also suffering from much misinformation, isn't as \"sexy\" to have and the qualities are always as relatable. Many people on the spectrum don't know they are. Having said that, diagnosis is not the most important thing. Knowing a person \\*technically\\* has ASD or ADHD isn't actually that useful in real life. This has to do with what mental health diagnoses actually are (not a cause to effect thing, but more a description of a bundle of symptoms).

This doesn't mean we will turn them away, but it can mean that the patient's insurance won't cover their care. If that happens we make the patient aware of this and talk through their options. In situations where insurance isn't involved, most of the time the therapist will still work with the patient, but help them identify what the best use of therapy will be for their specific goals. \n\nBut you're right that many people never take that first step because of the stigma, or the fear they will be told they don't have \"real problems\". I can say with confidence that this is something nobody has to worry about. You don't have to have a named diagnosis or be about to fall apart to talk to a therapist. Mental healthcare can be PROACTIVE and PREVENTATIVE, which means we want to help you get ahead of patterns and struggles in your life before things get out of hand. \n\nIn the end, if you or somebody you know is wondering if they'd benefit from seeing a therapist, a great start is to write down a couple challenges in your life (these can be as simple as \"I want to lose weight\" or \"Im not sure Im coping with stress well or \"I feel stuck in my career\" or \"Im feeling unsure about my relationship\") and then one or two goals you might have for yourself and then booking a session. If the therapist for some reason has other suggestions for your besides therapy, at least you'll be able to get those and know how to return to therapy if/when needed.",

            "comment": "How would you address people harmed or traumatized by mental health treatment, especially in cases where there wasn't any reportable wrongdoing on the part of prior therapist(s)?  It's something I've struggled with a lot because it often seems that the vast majority of therapists don't seem to want to engage with the idea of treatment potentially harming a patient.  I know when I've tried to bring it up with future therapists in real life I usually get a shocked \"oh I would *never* do anything to harm a patient!\" or something, which is honestly a problem because in my experience the most damaging therapists were the ones that were completely convinced therapy was going great.  (Often in retrospect I feel like I was manipulated by the therapist to continue because the therapist believed we were making progress.  At the time I didn't see how therapy was doing harm; I thought the therapists were great and I was just too messed up to understand, or that if it wasn't working right it was my fault for not being a good enough patient.  In my experience most therapists tended to encourage this view, albeit in more positive-sounding language.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat sort of safety standards beyond the really basic ethics would you suggest or look for to ensure a therapist isn't causing harm to a patient in their treatment plan, and especially how would you address cases where common treatments might cause harm to particular patients?  Again, this is something I've tried to address on the ground and it's just been impossible to get a straight answer.",

There isn't a way to answer that with a percentage, because drug addiction isn't something that one gets cured from. Drug and alcohol addiction viewed similarly to diabetes or heart disease, in that sense; it's not cured, it's managed. In treatment our goal is to improve functioning and decrease symptoms. The condition will always exist. It may go into remission, but it is always there. \n\nIn regards to success rates of treatment, this has always been complicated because we need to set clear perimeters in how we define \"success.\" (i.e., if a client is being treated for their 5-year-long meth addiction, and relapses once in their first week post-discharge, but is abstinent for the next 5 years, would that be considered success? I would say Yes; some researchers would say no.)  The best research has looked at success as the patient's follow-through of their aftercare plan. In those studies, success rates are right in line with what we'd see with the patient's success in follow-through for diabetes and heart disease (40-60%).   \n\n\\-Nick",

The good news is that people do get these things under control. With proper treatment, support, and internal readiness in the patient, we see that people can leave behind their broken patterns and the misery that comes with feeling like they \\*have\\* to use their drug. \n\nHowever, it is also common that people relapse into their old behavior, and we don't see recovery as a straight line from problem to solution. Clinically we know that its a winding path with steps forward and backward. The person isn't just quitting something, they are inventing a whole new way of life for themselves, and dealing with raw emotion and stress without the \"medications\" they have used to cope. Its expected that they will struggle along the way. \n\nI prefer not to use the word \"cure\" when talking about addiction because it implies that there are sick people and there are well people. In reality, even people with years of sobriety may still see themselves as \"working on it\" and every day as a new step in their long term recovery. \n\nBut the good news is: People DO recover. People CAN get better. If somebody is ready to be honest, openminded and willing to get help, anything is possible for them!",

What I can say, is that I don't think this should deter you from therapy in the future. \n\nNot giving direction, and putting it back on the client to determine the next course of action is a tactic used by therapists, but it's not used by ALL therapists, and it's not used in ALL situations. Therefore, your next therapist might have a completely different approach. \n\nWe talked about this a little bit in one of the questions in our latest episode. Sometimes people can become dependent on other people making decisions. Putting it back on the other person with \"What are you going to do about that\" type question can be useful to force the person to verbalize ideas they have that they wouldn't otherwise verbalize, and to build trust in one's own decision-making. But again, it's not the only strategy, and not used in all cases, so please continue on with therapy if you feel that therapy is still needed. \n\nAlternatively, if you were sticking with that same therapist, I would encourage you to bring it up to them and have a discussion about it. \n\nHope that helps, \n\n\\-Nick",

I didn\u2019t pressure her on this, because why? but now it\u2019s made my work life really miserable. I can\u2019t explain how or why, but I\u2019m absolutely filled with anxiety (or maybe fear) around her to the point I completely ignore her. It\u2019s getting really toxic since it affects my whole mood for the day/days, and I need something to change (and getting moved around isn\u2019t an option)\n\nTo make matters worse, my manager is\u2026 clingy, in a way. She likes to be really friendly, sometimes touching me (like cheek pinching stuff) and calling me her buddy and stuff\u2026 and if I hint or imply I\u2019m not her best friend she gets offended.

That's a good observation. I might spend some time examining what is driving that fear. \n\nPersonally, if I'm in that situation, and I'm having so much anxiety that I am completely silent around her and intentionally avoiding her, my guess is that she's picking up on that, and is probably having a similar experience. My strategy would be to force myself to say \"Hi\" or \"Good Morning\" when I see her. **BUT HERE'S THE KEY**, do so without any expectation of having any deeper conversation. Saying \"Good morning, Cindi,\" as I pass by her in the breakroom *and keep on walking*, helps me work through my anxiety and sends a message to her that 1) I don't want to treat her any differently than I would any other co-worker, and 2) by me walking away and not pushing the conversation any further, it sends the message that I have accepted that we won't be dating and she can feel comfortable knowing that I won't be pursuing it any further. \n\n\\-nick",

                    "comment": "Hi there! So as you'll hear elsewhere in the thread, I did a 6 hour series on ADHD for our [patreon.com/therapy](https://patreon.com/therapy) community in which we go over the entire history of the diagnosis, why we are seeing a surge in diagnoses today, exactly how we test and treat it, and a ton of other interesting tid bits. \n\nBut for your question let me point out a few things:\n\nSo in the 1980 edition of the \"Psychology Bible\" (the DSM 3) the diagnosis was \"Attention Deficit Disorder\". By 1987 the revised edition of the DSM 3 replaced that diagnosis with \"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\". \n\nIn 1994 the DSM 4 kept ADHD as the diagnosis but identified 3 flavors: \u201cADHD Combined Type\u201d, \u201cADHD Predominantly Inattentive Type\u201d, \u201cADHD Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type\u201d. Colloquially many people started referring to \"Inattentive Type\" as \"ADD\" and the other two as \"ADHD\". But really it was always clinically called \"ADHD\"\n\nIn 2013 the DSM 5 stayed with ADHD as the official name, but offered two sets of symptoms, an inattentive set and a hyperactive set. If a patient satisfied either set they received the diagnosis of ADHD. \n\nIn 2022 the most recent revision of the DSM 5 pretty much kept everything the same. So today, we only have a diagnosis called \"Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder\", we do have some specifiers to note whether the patient presents with predominantly inattentive of hyperactive of combined types. \n\nTLDR: They are not different diagnoses, but some people with AD/HD are inattentive, some hyperactive, and some combined. \n\nNow let's talk about Adult AD/HD:\n\nIts not special. We don't have a different diagnosis for adults than children, and part of the diagnosis requires onset of symptoms at an early age (currently 12 yo). The symptoms are easy to google but they are the same for adults or children. \n\nBefore I turn this thread into another 6 hour lecture on the topic I will conclude by pointing out that AD/HD is not considered a life long condition. 50% or more children with condition are expected to go into remission by adulthood, and \"neurodivergent\" is a word coined by Judy Singer (Australian Sociologist) as a way to destigmatize people who had mental differences, not a \\*type of person\\*.",

When you find a population you like and a job you love, I'm on team \"do more of that\". A happy therapist is an effective therapist. \n\nBut in your unique situation I think if you can have one foot in two different pools that would be great. When I did my graduate practicum/internship I intentionally practiced at three different sites in three parts of town serving three different populations. I'm glad I did, because it kept me from being myopic in my clinical worldview, or elitist about certain populations. \n\nIf your career has handed you an opportunity dabble in a couple different clinical spaces, I strongly encourage you to do that at this point in your career!",

I know therapy, like all of healthcare, isn't always a winning experience. The fact that you have given it multiple tries, and are here in this AMA, tell me you are a mental health advocate and somebody who doesn't give up, which is awesome. \n\nI think you're also asking a good question about your own trauma effecting how your raise your child. We have a saying in trauma work, \"that which is not transformed is transferred\". Meaning, if you don't pay your trauma bill your children will, in one way or another. \n\nDealing with your trauma can look like talking about it with your partner, your friends, doing a trauma workbook, journaling, doing reprocessing work in therapy, or any number of times you reflect upon your lived experiences as you develop as a parent. Sometimes trauma can make us a better parent, we have a \"Im not gonna do that shit\" mentality for our kiddo which causes to try harder than if we'd never experienced pain. It can also cause us to \"over correct\", where maybe we do more than we should because we so fear replicating what we've experienced - this btw is also part of \"transferring\" what we didn't \"transform\". \n\nI encourage you to pick up a trauma workbook and so some personal reflection work on this. Its not something you will \"solve\", its part of your lived story, but its something we want you to develop deep insight into and bring into your awareness when you're navigating your own relationship with your child.",

The advice I always give new therapists is to set good habits of daily self-care right away in the beginning, and learn to build separation between your personal life and your work life. \n\nI answered a question earlier today about vicarious trauma. A lot of therapists will leave the profession or move into administration early in their career because of what they call \"burnout,\" when in reality it's actually vicarious trauma that continues to accumulate without being dealt with. \n\nWe hear a lot of difficult stories, and over time, that can take it's toll. If she has co-workers or peers in the community that she is close to, I recommended her getting involved in a peer supervision group. In that group, she can verbally process events, thoughts, and emotions she has, as a way to debrief. Doing so allows the brain to language what she is experiencing, process it, and file it away so it doesn't sit there and accumulate. \n\nAnd yes, many therapists have therapists. I went to therapy several years ago, and it was the best money I every spent. It is not uncommon, and there is no therapist specialization needed for it. \n\nWe're excited to have a new colleague! Send her a warm welcome from Pod Therapy! \n\n\\-nick",

There a free test you can take on a government website called ONET called the Career Interest Profiler. That could be a neat way to explore other career paths if thats something you're in a position to do. If that's not something that's possible, another way to get through burnout might be to sit down and do a values inventory for yourself. Consider what are the 10 most important things for you to live a quality and satisfying life. Then evaluate how you are currently doing with each of those things, maybe give yourself a letter grade. This can sometimes give you perspective on what areas of your life you want to focus on to bring balance back.",

I don't even care about the Oscars, but when I see someone win... \n\nAnyway, my first thought is \"is this something you feel like you need to change?\" and if so \"why do you feel the need to change it?\" It's a strange question, but I ask it because sometimes people have this idea that we should never hold back emotion. Sometimes, holding back emotion is healthy (or benign). \n\nThe question we always like to ask is, \"is this causing a clinically significant amount of distress?\" We don't want to pathologize normal human behavior. I don't want you feeling like you have to cry. If stopping yourself from crying is not causing significant problems, then maybe it's not something we want to jump in to try to fix. \n\nIf on the other hand, your doing this in many areas of your life and it is causing significant distress, it could be something a therapist could help you with by finding strategies specific to your needs. \n\nProbably not the answer you were hoping for, but I hope it helps, \n\n\\-nick",

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a great method and I imagine has already given you great tools for dealing with existential dread and self hatred. \n\nFinding a specialist in a particular modality (theory, approach) can sometimes be difficult. However there are usually some great self help resources like workbooks and online support groups that might be a helpful supplement to what you're already doing. If you haven't already I'd encourage you to look up your local chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and see if they have any support groups you might be interested in joining. Especially as somebody who has experienced several mental health realities, you mind find so many people to relate to at NAMI and could probably bring some of what you've already learned to the community. \n\nYou might also enjoy the book \"Man's Search for Meaning\" by Victor Frankl, he is considered the father of Logotherapy, or Existential Therapy, which has a lot to say about existential dread and finding purpose in our lives.",

So thank you for that outlet in my life!\n\nOnto my question, how do you help someone who doesn't want to get help? My brother in law has been going through a hard time since he and my sister in law (who honestly both are having a bad time right now) moved to another state due to work. It seems anytime tries to help him, he doesn't want to talk about it. He shuts the conversation down and that's the end of it. Especially when a lot of family members have tried to talk to him about quitting his job and moving back which I know is easier said than done, but he won't even try.\n\nAlso, he (and my sister in law) seem to be drinking alcohol a lot heavier since they're really only around each other most of the days, and that is how they tolerate each other. I told my sister in law that isn't healthy which she knows.\n\nI just struggle with trying to figure out how to help them since I seem to get caught up in the middle of it. It has started to affect my mental health as well, but I don't want to have to set boundaries in place when I know they're needing help.\n\nThanks!",

We've got the greatest listeners! \n\nSecondly, I absolutely empathize with your situation. It's really painful to be in a front-row seat of a loved one's struggles. Normalizing seeking therapy was the main drive for creating this podcast, and we have a long way to go. For a lot of people, many of them males, talking to a therapist is like admitting defeat. I'm hopeful that as more people open up about their own experiences in therapy, it will motivate people like your brother-in-law to get some help. \n\nIn the meantime, unless they are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others, the best we can do is be supportive and continue to encourage them to talk to someone. Express your concerns, tell them you are there to help, but that you cannot do what a trained professional can do. \n\nI'll also take this time to talk about self-care. Boundaries aren't put in place to keep a distance from others, but instead for self-protection. When you're in the middle of all of this, it takes a toll mentally and emotionally. Like jumping into the ocean to save someone from drowning, their instinct is to push you down to keep themselves up. We need to learn to help in ways that don't put ourselves in danger. For this, I'd just remind you of the Al Anon 3C's: \n\n1) You didn't Cause it\n\n2) You can't Control it\n\n3) You can't Cure it \n\nBe a cheerleader and continue to point them in the direction of help. They need to take the steps to get there. \n\n\\-Nick",

The profession is very much aware of the this pattern and therefore requires 2-3 years (different depending on states/countries) of direct supervision before being able to practice independently. Even to become a clinical supervisor requires years of training, which focuses heavily on the gatekeeping function we have to our profession. I, personally, have had to deny someone of the opportunity to enter the field because I was concerned about their unstable mental health. It was devastating to that individual, but my loyalties are to my profession and the people we serve, not to my interns. \n\nI obviously cannot speak to your personal experiences or to the specific therapists you know, but I can say that I am proud of the efforts made in my State and with my Board to ensure clinicians that earn their license are capable of treating others. \n\n\\-nick",

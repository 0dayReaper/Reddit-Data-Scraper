I went from educating folks in our viewing area to now talking about weather with millions across the internet.  Did I mention this has been bizarre?\n\nA few links to share here:\n\nPlease help us help the victims of this year's hurricane season: https://www.redcross.org/donate/cm/nexstar-pub\n\nAnd you can find my forecasts and weather videos on my Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/WKRG.Alan.Sealls/\n\n[Here is my proof](https://twitter.com/WKRG/status/906301177154949120)\n\nAnd lastly, thanks to the /u/WashingtonPost for the help arranging this! \n \nAlright, quick before another hurricane pops up, ask me anything!\n\n[EDIT: We are talking about this Reddit AMA right now on WKRG Facebook Live too! https://www.facebook.com/WKRG.News.5/videos/10155738783297500/]\n\n[EDIT #2 (3:51 pm Central time): THANKS everyone for the great questions and discussion.

It'd be one thing for a short minute to show how powerful the wind is, but I saw multiple reporters standing in open roads with debris blowing around in the background for full hours at a time. I was like, man, all it takes is one tree branch to explode and you'd be riddled with splinters flying 70+mph. While it'd prove a point to the viewers, it seems totally irresponsible of the stations/weathermen.\n\nStay safe Alan, your reporting will be much more effective if you're not a human pincushion.",

Sure. But is it necessary to people's understanding that hurricane = windy danger cloud? No. \n\nI watched one of them during Irma who was reporting live say something like \"I'm just going to step in here (a sheltered area) where it's less windy and a bit safer.\" Then 30 seconds later when they cut back to him, he's back out standing in the wind. The look on his face said \"My asshole producer just ordered me to go stand back out here, despite it being completely unnecessary.\"",

That evening, the worst storm to hit South East England for three centuries caused record damage and killed 19 people.\n\n\u200ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fish#Hurricane_controversy",

This is partly due to gas exchange at the water surface, but mainly due to plankton and certain plants oxygenating the water using photosynthesis. \nAs you may guess, deeper you go , less light will reach that depth, thus this limits oxygenation at depth.\n\nIf water is very still that oxygen won't get mixed, and apparently can be slid offshore (this part is new to me, but possible).\n\nSource: I know stuff... and environmental scientist having done quite some research on coastal and reservoir dynamics",

You're right they tend to not have a lot of lightning but they do have some, and the new satellites are showing it to us.",

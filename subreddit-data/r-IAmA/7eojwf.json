Don't misinform people.\n\n What you are showing in that pic is a way companies are trying to work around net neutrality by offering no MB quota for specific vendors of various services, and normal MB quotas for vendors they don't work with. But you are always allowed access and with no artificial speed limitation (which is entirely different from the MB/GB quota your contracts offers with no additional charge). \n\nIn US if net neutrality things will be worse, because ISPs will be legally allowed to block access to service vendors they don't work with.

Sure, stuff isn't getting blocked, that's the fundamental difference but they are charging for traffic for selected services. The way I understand NN, no service is above other, they are all internet traffic. Whatever traffic you're allowed shouldn't be discriminated depending on what service you access. If you can't charge to not block something specific, you shouldn't be allowed to charge to allow access to something specific. You can also see it as they blocking whatever services are not contemplated on the extra allowance you're paying for. It doesn't feel right, regardless and NN should be there to prevent this too.",

The way it works in that one is as follow: \n\nYou pay, say, 4.99 Euro per month for mobile internet at a high bandwidth, for up to 2 GB of data (&lt;&lt; all numbers made up, sorry, can't recall the exact values).\n\nAfter using that amount at a high bandwidth, you can continue using an unlimited amount of data, albeit, at a much lower bandwidth.\n\n*But* -- here's where net neutrality comes in, in a sneaky way -- some services are exempt from this throttling. In the Dutch ad/contract I read, these were similar services like the ones above, i.e. snapchat, insta, etc.",

For Google, at least, we're all customers from searching, so we should all be concerned that the end of Net Neutrality will affect our search results.\n\nThese software giants are global so people across the world can start to pressure these companies to join in. Having large companies join in would be a large boon to the Net Neutrality movement, and having people from around the world pressuring them to support Net Neutrality would be very important and helpful, if not critical.\n\nConsider contacting your local reporters to have them look into companies stances on Net Neutrality to help put pressure on the companies to support it.\n\nThanks for helping us out (and Happy Cake Day!)!",

The owner might be one, but every facility or whatever you call it, is most likely kind of \"owned\"/controlled by different people and not everyone is greedy, at least not on the same scale.\n\nThat's just assumption but I don't really know what else it could be. Like, it doesn't matter where I work, I work for money, that is, if the best I could get is to work at tobacco company for a year or two, even though I don't smoke nor support it, it would be because of money I'd get, not because I support it. I think it's the same everywhere, as most people prefer to live for themselves and not others.\n\nJust like you could work at verizon but be against it's decisions but stay silent inside the company because you don't want to lose a well paid spot in it.",

While disappointed with the outcome, we will continue our efforts to eliminate barriers and give the unconnected an easier path to the internet and the opportunities it brings.\u201d\n\nWhile the campaign for net neutrality was happening Facebook  tweaked the notifications tab on users\u2019 homepages to notify them about friends who, apparently, supported free basics \u2013 which, as it turned out, wasn\u2019t entirely\u00a0true.\n\nSo nobody should trust these big companies.",

This will encrypt your data so that no third parties are able to get it (ISPs etc) it also helps bypass Geo blocks, and protocol throttling.\n\n\u2022 Keep your social media usage as little as possible.\n\n\u2022 Use throwaway accounts on Reddit. Especially if you give away identifying information or post in local subreddits.\n\n\u2022 Extra tip, use PGP on sensitive exchanges.\n\nIf anyone has any extras please share! :)",

We're not dying from the inside out, we're not becoming a third world country, etc.\n\nWhat you are seeing is an internal institutional battle that has culminated all at once. \n\nThe Hollywood sex scandals? This is bad, but it's also good in a way because this stuff was going on THE ENTIRE TIME. This is us cleaning house. This is people, mostly women, feeling they have enough support to come out against abusers. It looks bad, but it has to happen for us to move forward and become better. We need to dismantle the culture of unchecked abuse.\n\nThe other stuff you mention (Net Neutrality, elephant hunting, climate pact abandonment, basically everything Trump and his corporate toadies do) is a showdown between America's love for corporations/capitalism and our basic institutions that exist for the people. Trump is pretty much the avatar for all the terrible things that capitalism is capable of doing. What is happening now is the American political and cultural spheres that he is touching are responding.\n\nSometimes good, sometimes not. On a national level, there is a political rebuke (such as was seen in VA and Jersey) of Trump and the Republican party. The importance of our sometimes invisible third check and balance, the judiciary, is now coming front and center in important issues like the travel ban. Senators from his own party are now denouncing the president and VERY importantly, I think it is becoming more clear to the average American how much power has been devolved to the executive branch of American government away from the other two.\n\nThink of what you are seeing as America getting a really bad flu and all the stuff going on are the white blood cells dealing with it. There's vomit, we're shitting ourselves, nobody feels good, but our institutional body is fighting something that runs contrary to it's health (as a democracy). You're not watching a downfall yet, you're watching America get some serious stress testing.\n\nI don't know where it leads, but Americans have to get involved and rebuke capitalist cronyism. They have to vote and they have to communicate with their representatives and remind them who serves who. This happened to us before at the turn of the last century and we survived the Gilded Age. I think we will overcome it again this time, it just won't be pretty to watch.\n",

Videomax is a streaming service that can only used on their streaming service like HOOQ (netflix equivalent in indonesia) and supersoccertv for straming soccer matches everywhere around the world. the \"kuota fb and BBM\" can only used on facebook and blackberry messenger which nobody use anyway.\n\nso only have 1 gig of data for browsing the internet, 500 mb if you are out of the city and if you want to use the rest of 4 gigs you need to use their aplication. pic from /u/reardaranda in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/7eh08w/when_a_country_doesnt_have_a_net_neutrality_laws/)",

            "comment": "Serious question from a non-american non-lawyer who is probably talking out of his ass but is an absolute cunt and rules sharks based on the exact wording of things in card games. (If I can out argue an MTG judge I think I can do this too, right?)\n\nHere is the exact wording of your 1st amendment:\n\n&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\n\nI see several ways this can be used to protect Net Neutrality forever:  \n*(I'll go from most to least serious suggestion)*\n\n1) \"abridging the freedom of speech\" - The internet is a place where people can speak freely, yes? Without NN this can easily become harder, therefore free speech has been abridged, no?\n\n2) \"or of the press\" - If I have to pay a service provider an extra $3 to look at Kotaku (let's just say I wanted to for some mad reason.) but CNN is free - then the freedom (as in open accessibility) of the press has been restricted.\n\n3) \"petition the government\" - THE LITERAL WAY YOU DO THIS NOW IS ON THE INTERNET???\n\n4) \"religion (...) free exercise thereof\" - Ok so this one is a dumb fucking suggestion but *if everyone on reddit claims that the internet is their religion and worship requires net neutrality, then that means they can't ever touch it, right?* - is that dumb enough that it might actually fucking work? Because after all what is a religion but a set of common beliefs shared by a lot of people?\n\nHave these arguments been made and seriously considered by courts yet? Because it seems to me like any sort of repeal of NN is a massive breach of the constitution in several ways.\n\n**Note: I genuinely want people to point out to me if and why these arguments don't work - please do not downvote anyone who plays devil's advocate in this discussion!**",

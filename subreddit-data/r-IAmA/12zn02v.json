Many will not be comfortable with using verification technologies like FaceID, and that is OK. That said, others believe that using tools like FaceID creates a better, safer customer experience. In that latter scenario, we have seen that with proper controls, and if a user TRUSTS a company, they'll give up some control to gain better usability.",

Contrasting that to some AI cars all jamming up and stopping at the same time in my city (Phoenix) this week...that was pretty concerning. I was thinking...wow..they all just stopped at the same time but what if they all put the pedal to the medal and took off full speed at the same time? That would be tragic.",

If there are no red flags along the way, would it be possible for that fake object to convince core systems that it is a legitimate person? It seems that planting a seed inside the right system could create a self sustained identity, especially if that identity is managed regularly by an AI, ensuring that the \"person\" is registered as regularly going to the doctor, taking vaccine shots, school records, rejection of military service due to medical records, injecting fake tax records etc.\n\nHow difficult would it be for an AI to maintain such a person assuming that the government systems also use automated services based on AI technology?",

Basically treating it like a search engine on steroids with a helpful spirit that tries to make sense of it for me.\n\nSome days are good; CGPT nails it. Other days, CGPT confidently tells me something very wrong, but still convincingly right. Yet other times, when it's giving me an example configuration but that configuration happens to be long? I've seen it just stop sending output. I have to point that out to CGPT to get it to give me the rest of the truncated info.  \n\n\nConsequently, I've found myself having to dumb down my questions and/or parcel my request into smaller chunks. And as I get to understand the results of those chunks, I then take the relevant references from one or more and then try to get CGPT to help splice the bits together, but still with a goal of keeping CGPT's responses brief, in case there's a repeat of dropped/truncated info. Going through this today, in fact.\n\nCGPT might be great at writing papers, but so far I've yet to see a vast chunk of \"ready to use RIGHT NOW\" code come out of CGPT, at least IME. I've even had a few occasions where the code CGPT spat out was... tragic, to say the least.",

Sure watermarks can be painstakingly removed but this would still stop the heavy spam of fake art flooding every website. And there's specific ways you can make watermarks that it's next to impossible to remove cleanly.\n\nAnd AI voices should have whispers saying \"This is AI\" during dialogue, unless it's special cases with the original owner of said voice giving consent.\n\n\nSame for deepfaked faces. Big obtrusive watermarks covering the face rapidly, or just outright do it badly unless the owner of said face gives consent.\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these? What's a regulation you believe should be pushed for instead? I think so far these are a fine thing that doesn't halt the progression of AI, and helps be a deterrent to the worst immoral things about AI.",

We\u2019re staff with the Washington Emergency Management Division on Camp Murray, WA and the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, WA and we\u2019re here to answer your volcano questions!\n\nIn May 1980, the world changed forever when Mt. St. Helens erupted. Each May these past few years, we\u2019ve liked to pay tribute and remember what happened and part of that is answering your questions.\n\nWe\u2019ll have lots of folks joining us today. And they are prepared to answer questions on the volcanoes in Washington and Oregon as well as Hawaii and Yellowstone and general volcano and preparedness questions. They can try to answer questions about volcanoes elsewhere but make no promises.\n\nWe\u2019re all using this one account and will sign our first names after we speak.\n\nHere today (but maybe not all at once):\n\nBrian Terbush, volcano program coordinator for Washington Emergency Management Division\n\nMike Poland (Yellowstone, Kilauea and Krakatoa)\n\nEmily Montgomery-Brown (volcano deformation, monitoring)\n\nLiz Westby (volcano communications, Mount St. Helens)\n\nWendy Stovall (volcano communications, Yellowstone, Hawaii)\n\nJon Major (Cascades, volcano deformations, general volcanoes)\n\nWes  Thelen  (Earthquakes, Kilauea)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's our .gov website and a [blog about this event.](https://mil.wa.gov/news/volcano-awareness-month-brings-time-to-ask-experts-questions) [Proof of who we are via our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/waEMD/status/1656699363815723008), which still has a gray checkmark.

                    "comment": "Good question, and thanks for asking! It's possible, but really unlikely. Looking at other large earthquakes and eruptions around the world, there usually needs to be magma high up in the volcano, and getting ready to erupt for the shaking from an earthquake to \"trigger\" an eruption.For Reference, our most recent Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake (in 1700) did not trigger any eruptions of any of our 5 active volcanoes. SImilar stories? In 2004, the magnitude 9.4 Sumatra earthquake, in an area with far more frequently-erupting volcanoes than the pacific northwest didn't trigger any of them to erupt either; nor did the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan.So historically, it's not really common.However, since we want to make sure you're prepared for all the hazards you could possibly face - a good idea is to make sure that whatever your plans for disasters are, they will work if other hazards occur, too!  For instance, would your volcano plan work after an earthquake, or would the earthquake damage something that means you wouldn't be able to receive volcano alerts, or properly evacuate. If there was an earthquake, are you still ready for a flood? or Fire? or other far more common hazards?  NOW, while things aren't happening \\*knocks on wood\\* is the best time to think about things like that, and make sure your evacuation and communication plans would still work if soomething was different than just one disaster at a time (earthquakes might not trigger volcanoes very frequently, but they do often cause landslides, tsunamis, and fires). And what about fiires or floods during Pandemics? Those are challenges we all had to think about during the past couple of years, that made things more complicated.I recommend reaching out to your local emergency management agency as a place to begin learning about the hazards in your area, and what you need to be prepared for them.Hope this helps!  \n\\-Brian   (Edited post to add name)",

Volcanoes have their own magmatic systems and whether or not they erupt is based on what's happening locally, within that system. It's incredibly hard for an external event to trigger an eruption. Just look to the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake (Mw 9.0\u20139.1) as an example. The large earthquake didn't trigger eruptions from volcanoes in Japan (or elsewhere). - Liz",

I think as a resident of Tacoma, it's more important to think about what you should be doing *NOW* to mitigate the impacts of a future eruption. There are some great resources on Pierce County's \"Active Volcano\" web page where you can learn about Rainier/Tahoma's hazards and what you can do to get prepared for them (Which is quite a lot!)  \n[https://www.bing.com/search?q=pierce+county+active+volcano+web+page&amp;cvid=6fd66d8f389b443ca02a81b779848f0f&amp;aqs=edge..69i57j0j69i11004.5871j0j1&amp;FORM=ANAB01&amp;PC=U531](https://www.bing.com/search?q=pierce+county+active+volcano+web+page&amp;cvid=6fd66d8f389b443ca02a81b779848f0f&amp;aqs=edge..69i57j0j69i11004.5871j0j1&amp;FORM=ANAB01&amp;PC=U531)  \n\n\nEven though Mt. Rainier is a really big volcano, it's really not very explosive - much less so than Mt. St. Helens. It's biggest hazard is lahars, or volcanic bmudflows, so what your actual danger is from a Mt. Rainier eruption really depends where you are in Tacoma.  If you're up on the hill, (like most of the city), you really don't have much immediate danger at all - but there will definitely be long-term impacts to any large enough to make it all the way to Tacoma - it would take a huge one to get that far, and it would cause long-term changes to the river valleys..  \n\n\nIf you are down in the river valley, you'll want to know how to reach the safety of high ground, and how you're going to be alerted that there's something you need to evacuate going on. For Tacoma, there are outdoor warning sirens to warn about lahars, but a NOAA weather radio, and subscribing to PC Alerts (from Pierce County), will really help you know when you need to get up and go! you can find links and information about both those sources (and USGS's Volcano notification Service) at [https://mil.wa.gov/alerts](https://mil.wa.gov/alerts)!  \n\n\nHope this helps! - Brian",

Here's a video that sheds some light on the timing of those lahars in the zones: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYTbfySHSxU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYTbfySHSxU)  \n\n\nWhile their maps are excellent, the form you usually get to see them in isn't the most interactive - I recommend checking out Washington DNR's geology portal for an interactive version of the same maps, where you can type in an address and compare it to the maps. it's available at  https;[//geologyportal.dnr.wa.gov](//geologyportal.dnr.wa.gov)   \n\n\n(Unfortunately, it doesn't work well on mobile, but if you're at a computer I hghly recommend that site.  \nOn the table of contents on the left when you open the page, uncheck \"surface geology\"  then check \"Volcanoes\" and \"Volcanic hazards\" in the drop-down menu that shows up - and type in the address you want to know about.  \n\\-Brian",

Mount Hood is not a highly explosive volcano, rather it tends to erupt lava domes much like what we saw at Mount St. Helens in the 1980s and again in 2004.  It has shed some large volcanic mudflows that have traveled down the Hood, White, and Sandy River valleys.  The current geometry of the mountain is such that the next eruption will likely occur on the south side (which is where the focus of activity has been the past few thousand years).  One of the most concerning aspects of a future eruption will be the possibility of pyroclastic flows related to collapses of new lava dome growth, and they could flow down toward Government Camp.  So, will Hood wake up anytime soon?  Hard to say.  Just like any of our other Cascades volcanoes, it has been active over the past few thousands of years, but currently shows no signs of unusual activity.  It does have a fairly consistent habit of minor earthquakes and minor earthquake swarms, but these are part of its background chatter and not out of the ordinary.",

It became \"gravitationally unstable\" and failed, generating a huge landslide. The landslide \"uncorked\" the volcano to generate a northward blast. At the time, scientists were very concerned about the landslide but didn't anticipate the ferocity of the lateral blast.  - Liz",

So chances are, if you live in the PNW for a lifetime (reaching 100 yrs of age) you will have experienced 1-2 eruptions. When the next one will occur, we can't say. Mount St. Helens went from a quiet volcano to producing a catastrophic eruption in 1980 with only 2 months of warning, which is why we talk so much about being prepared for the next eruption. At CVO, we install monitoring equipment on volcanoes to help give us early warnings of unrest, and we'll pass that information along to you. - Liz",

                    "comment": "A lot of great questions in here, thanks for asking! Will answer a couple, and save some for other experts (who will arrive around 11):- Washington has always been a \"home rule\" state, meaning the State government isn't allowed to force anyone to evacuate, no matter the hazard. in some areas, local officials can override that and force evacuations, but it depends on the area. To add to the complication though, while geologists monitoring the volcano knew it was potentially preparing for a larger eruption, forecasting exactly when, where, and how large an eruption will be (annd in which direction, precisely which hazards will accompany it, etc.) is still not an exact science. The observatories have gotten much better at it since 1980 from working with and on other voolcanoes around the world, but it's still tough to say exactly when something will happen, and that uncertainty really makes telling people to evacuate difficult. Imagine being told to leave your home, asking \"for how long\" and officials not having a solid answer. In volcanoes in unrest around the world, that time before an eruption could be days, but it could also be weeks, months, or even years - annd the volcano may not even end up erupting at all! (this happened with our own mt. Baker in 1975 - several months of unrest, no eruption!). So this uncertainty makes it really difficult.From my perspective in emergency management  - I respect that people make their own decisions about  whether to evacuuate or not, but the really important thing is to help people understand exactly what those hazards they might face are *when* their volcano erupts, so they can make a solid and informed decision for themself and their family.\n\n\\- *On St. Helens over a Hot Spot*:  All the volcanoes in the Ccascade Range in Washington, but also Oregon, Northern California, and British Columbia, are located along a subduction zone - where the plate of Juan De Fuca is subducting beneath the North American plate. Once that plate reaches a certain depth in earth's mantle, it releases water, which causes the mantle to melt, and that melt becomes Magma, and rises up through 30-40 miles of continental crust. This is a long  and difficult journey, so it only ends up coming to the surface in several places, but it tennds to continue following those pathways for thousannds of years, since they become paths of least resistance of a sort, the easiest ways for magna to reach the surfacee, so those vents where magma repetetively reaches the surface are called volcanoes.  This is why if you look at a map of volcanoes in the Pacific northwest, you'll see that most of the volcanoes are roughly parallel to the subducting pate, and about the same distance inland from it: [https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/cvo](https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/cvo) (&lt;there's a good map of the volcano locations.)  Mt. St. Helens is a bit offset from the others, but it's magma still comes from the same subduction zone as the other volcanoes, just takes a different journey to reach the surface!\n\n...hope that helps for a couple fo the questions - and I'm going to let others answer some of the other questions on here!-Brian",

It comes out of solution as the pressure drops, causing the magma to grow bubbles that expand and break the magma apart.  The pieces between the bubbles are the volcanic ash.  --Larry",

But the predicted warming was just a fraction of a degree.  I am not aware of measurements yet that confirm the prediction.  It was pretty small in any case.  Most big eruptions have a cooling effect because SO2 aerosols reflect the sun's heat back into space.

And at the far side, there she was - Mme. Pele doing her thing down in Halema'uma'u. You could see the orange and red glow in the cracks breaking the lava crust on the lake as they slowly meandered across the surface, sparkling as occasional drops of water fell in, while the tunnel feeding the lake poured out millions of tons of white hot liquid basalt, kicking out heat waves so intense you could hear them just by looking at them from our perch a couple miles away.\n\nRain was absolutely soaking the Volcano Village, 200' below, but the edge of the caldera was barely above the cloud line, and the rain kept trying to send little wisps of clouds into the caldera where they would get blown apart because of the rising heat. The sky above was crystal clear, with Mauna Loa looming in the distance and the Big Dipper draping her southern shoulder. And then - the full moon came charging up past the trees behind us, casting a goddamn full-color MOONBOW which arc'd high over K\u012blauea Crater and terminated IN the lava lake.\n\nIt was like Hawaii was showing off. I've never seen anything like it.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/9SZLqnV.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/U4meRhr.jpg\n\nAnyway, I know research is one thing, and academic life is another, but all of you have spent time in places like this and, oh man - life well spent!\n\nI'm still blown away just thinking about it.  If I'd experienced this when I was younger, I'd probably have given serious thought to moving to Hawaii to study volcanoes.\n\nHow did you all decide to go into this field?  And was it just coincidence that caused Kilauea and Mauna Loa to shut down at the same time last year?  And why did Kilauea go *off* a couple weeks later?",

I landed on volcanology because of watching volcano documentaries on TV while in geology undergrad. Geology is such a slow process, except for natural hazards, and volcanoes create new and fertile lands (after the decimate everything) - it was the death and rebirth cycle that pulled me in (I have my woo-woo tendencies).

These are the times where you conduct research on a topic, which really allows you to become an expert on a specialized area of that research. But you  can be thinking about that specilaization for a long time. I studied geology for my Bachleors, but realized I really wanted to learn more about volcanoes, so searched for a program where I'd be able to research them for a Master's.  \nBut everyone's Story of how they got here is a little different, so I'm sure other volcanologists on this AMA will have different stories.

Hood, but it's at least seismic and GPS).  Since hood hasn't erupted in a while, there will likely be earthquakes that move upward through the edifice as magma moves close to the surface, which seismometers will be able to detect. The best way for you to remain informed of this activity is to Sign up for USGS' Volcano notification service - they'll send an Information Statement if anything looks unusual about mt. hood (or any other cascades volcanoes), and if it appears to be potentially moving towards eruption might raise the alert level from Normal to Advisory, Watch, or Warning.

Regarding Mount Hood, we do have a network of sesmic stations around that volcano.  Every few years it produces a small swarm of earthquakes, usually below Mount Hood Meadows, with magnitudes up to around 2.  But they have always died back down.  Last eruption was in the 1700s.  The last one before that one was several thousand years ago.  So it doesn't erupt as often as St. Helens, or Rainier.  --Larry",

It is still building a dome that has almost entirely filled the crater back up.  Now, comparing Bezy to MSH, Bezy has been much more voluminous in its dome building thus far (faster building).

We try to strike a \"scare and prepare\" balance in everything we share - it's critical that people understand the hazards, and respect the potential magnitude of it's impact on their lives - but don't become overwhelmed by the size to the point where they are unwilling to do anything. It's true that these are incredibly powerful forces of nature - but it's also true that people are not powerless in the face of them, and there are so many steps people, neighborhoods, communities, and governments at all levels can take to minimize their impacts when they do eventually happen.  \n\\-Brian",

Some magma gets caught by the \"sponge\" and sits there to crystalize - a bit of liquid is left behind. When that liquid collects into a large enough amount (maybe 50%), it is considered eruptable, but that doesn't mean an eruption will occur.  Based on science, both Yellowstone and Long Valley only have a small fraction of melt (between 5-20% maybe...). However, the tap of magma feeding the storage region at Long Valley is probably a trickle compared to a hotspot. \n\nNow hot spots - Yellowstone and Hawaii are both fed by hotspots. But Yellowstone's hot spot is in the middle of a continent and the continental crust is THICK and made of rocks stubbornly resilient rocks and minerals.  Hawaii is in the middle of an ocean, and oceanic crust is pretty thin and weak (less silica more iron).  So, Hawaii's hotspot is voluminous and effective at supplying magma to the volcanoes that reside above the hotspot's apex. Magma is stored in an interconnected network of storage regions (so we think) at Hawaiian volcanoes, but there's WAY more liquid than at Yellowstone, which is why K\u012blauea is considered one of the most active volcanoes on the planet. Interestingly, there's an experiment happening right now at K\u012blauea to create a subsurface image of the volcano's plumbing system.  We will know much more about what it's like once the results come in.

Vesuvius was not a well-monitored volcano in 79 A.D. (and while it is now, it is still considered one of the world's most dangerous volcanoes due to how close it is to major populations).  So for Pompeii and Herculaneum, there really wasn't official warning that the volcano was going to erupt. For St. Helens in 1980, there were signs of an eruption for months leading up to it, so there was warning, and there was an understanding of what could happen - but the ultimate style of eruption surprised everyone.\n\nEvery eruption around the world (unfortunately, some of which end in tragedy) help scientists to better forecast what might happen at the next eruption - which helps them work together with local officials to help get more people out of harm's way. But there is still a lot of uncertainty involved, especially with exact eruption timing.  This can be a huge challenge, because people look at the volcano and don't \\*see\\* it erupting, so they figure everything is fine, and get antsy about getting back to their activities (which might be their livelihood, like the loggers around St. Helens - so understandable). There are a lot of factors at play, and a lot of reasons people may choose to stay in a dangerous area. We just try to ensure that they actually understand the risk, so when they make that decision, they understand the risk they're taking for themselves.  \n\n\nHope this helps -Brian",

Phreatic eruptions, etc. All of this activity was taking place within the plug that gave the cone it's height and had created a graceful carpet of debris that shaped it into the beloved Mt Fuji appearance.\n\nWith the injection of magma up into the throat of the cone, it was blunted off to the north to become the bulge. What was it about the summit plug that forced the magma sideways? I thought that the summit plug would have been progressively damaged and weakened by all the preliminary activity that was taking place in it? Shouldn't the magma have been able to push the broken plug out of the way?\n\nWith that in mind, what managed to contain that much explosive potential in the magma intrusion? If the cone of the mountain was made up mostly of debris that wasn't very homogenous I would have thought the magma intrusion would have pushed the north face apart and began erupting instead of remaining contained under it? Mount Lassen is a plug volcano that erupted from it's summit and I guess I think it logically should have happened in a similar way at Mt St Helens?",

Mount Rainier would threaten more people however, especially with lahars down the Carbon and Puyallup River valleys.  Newberry Volcano could produce lava flows and cinder cones that threaten Bend.  If another lava dome started growing on the south side of Mount Hood (as it did in the 1700s), Timberline Lodge and Mount Hood Meadows would be threatened, along with houses in the Sandy River Valley.  --Larry",

Fortunately, many of them are remote and do not have large populations very close by.  But several of them have a habit of shedding large volcanic mudflows that can affect communities far down valley, and some are explosive enough to send substantial amounts of ash down wind.  As noted in answer to another questions, we have about 1-2 eruptions per century in the Cascades.  We monitor the major volcanoes for any signs of unusual activity and will notify the public and public authorities of any changes that concern us.  -- Jon",

But if you look at the geological record, Mount St. Helens is the most likely to erupt next.  Indeed, it has the most earthquakes of any Cascade volcano (followed by Rainier and Hood). But background earthquake activity is not a reliable measure of the potential of eruption.\n\n\\--Wes",

I remember someone once asked the hypothetical question what if you could trade a film that is currently available with one that is lost to the mists of time. Would we really prefer to have LAM over West of Zanzibar or The Unknown or in the extreme case Phantom of the Opera. And actually I do have one more lost film I wish would surface, THUNDER - which looks like a fine character role for Chaney.",

Interviews were filmed over the last 12 months - as and when we could raise funds - and included key older figures such as Jack Hill &amp; Roger Corman (who also discussed Vincent Price, Peter Lorre, Basil Rathbone &amp; Hazel Court - not Karloff though because I interviewed Roger about BK for my last film). In addition we interviewed  Beverley Washburn, Kim Newman, Greg Mank, Bill Fleck, Mark Iveson, and just before the Reddit session a preliminary interview with John Soister. So we have filmed a fair bit, though there's a good deal still to do. Hopefully the Indiegogo campaign will enable this. If you'd like to follow up with any more questions please contact me on Facebook - you vcan go via Boris Karloff: The Man Behind the Monster - as after this morning I won't be checking the Reddit very often.",

                    "comment": "Hi Njdevils901,\n\nThat's a terrific question. \n\nAnd the honest answer is that while I enjoy editing, I'm actually very slow and not very disciplined in terms of putting together a full documentary, \n\nGoing into a project I'll have some key sequences in mind but the overall structure is something I've tended to arrive at later. \n\nWith Leslie Howard, it took me about 18 months and a couple of passes to create the first edit, and probably another 5 or 6 to do the 2nd version. This was all on FCP, However when we got the funding to fully finish Howard, it needed to be re-edited on Avid for the post-production house and as I had no experience on Avid, we hired a pro to come in and reconstruct what I'd created - he also added some new ideas and there was a lot of additional archive added- all of which resulted in a tighter and more polished film. \n\nWith Karloff, in part because of the vast volume of material we assembled (far too much really) I struggled to get a handle on my opening sequence - for quite a while. Also I knew I needed to start using Avid. \n\nSo it was only at the end of 2020 when I was able to get an AVID system (and learn Avid) that I started making headway - putting together the first 17 minutes up to the introduction of Maria in a burst of editing over a month. However although I knew by then how I wanted to tell the story, I realised I wouldn't be able to maintain the pace while covering all the other production aspects (Shout needed the complete film within 5-6 months) So I brought in an outside editor - Anuree De Silva, who did a terrific job - in what became a very productive if exhausting collaboration.\n\nOn The Chaneys, I'm going in with a much more definite sense of how I'll tell the story - and am already working with editor Anthony Magnoni - who created the two trailers you can see on the Kickstarter and current Indiegogo campaigns we ran.\n\nHope that answers your question. \n\nTom",

Horror as a genre didn't really exist in American silent cinema - at least not in the way we think of horror cinema post 1931.\n\nI\\\\ think Chaney was seen as this extraodinary actor who could do almost anything on screen and was a true one of a kind in cinema. I think some critics did turn their noses up a little at the more extrem Browning - Chaney collaborations - interestingly reviews of London After Midnight were decidedly mixed. However I think the fact that Chaney always invested a strong if twisted vein of humanity into his characters meant this films weren't just dismissed as camp (a term and a concept that didn't exist back then). The thing to alos remember is that Chaney played numerous straight character parts in the late 20's in very well regarded films such as Tell it to the Marines, Thunder, Mockery etc.",

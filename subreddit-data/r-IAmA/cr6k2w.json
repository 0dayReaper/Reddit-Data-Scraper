    "postText": "Hey Reddit!\n\nI'm a Hong Kong person in the midst of the protests and police brutality. AMA about the political situation here. I am sided with the protesters (went to a few peaceful marches) but I will try to answer questions as unbiased as possible.\n\nEDIT: I know you guys have a lot of questions but I'm really sorry I can't answer them instantly. I will try my best to answer as many questions as possible but please forgive me if I don't answer your question fully; try to ask for a follow-up and I'll try my best to get to you. Cheers!\n\nEDIT 2: Since I'm in a different timezone, I'll answer questions in the morning. Sorry about that! Glad to see most people are supportive :) To those to aren't, I still respect your opinion but I hope you have a change of mind. Thank you guys!\n\nEDIT 3: Okay, so I just woke up and WOW! This absolutely BLEW UP! Inbox is completely flooded with messages!! Thank you so much you all for your support and I will try to answer as many questions as I can. I sincerely apologize if I don't get to your question. Thank you all for the tremendous support!\n\nEDIT 4: If you're interested, feel free to visit r/HongKong, an official Hong Kong subreddit. People there are friendly and will not hesitate to help you. Also visit r/HKsolidarity, made by u/hrfnrhfnr if you want. Thank you all again for the amounts of love and care from around the globe.\n\nEDIT 5: Guys, I apologize again if I don\u2019t get to you. There are over 680 questions in my inbox and I just can\u2019t get to all of you. I want to thank some other Hong Kong people here that are answering questions as well. \n\nEDIT 6: Special thanks to u/Cosmogally for answering questions as well. Also special thanks to everyone who\u2019s answering questions!!\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/1lYdEAY](https://imgur.com/1lYdEAY)\n\nAMA!",

It typically runs for 72 hours.  \n\nAfter 72 hours you have a profile of the cell phone towers near your home.  If a new cell tower signal pops up later, you can set your phone not to connect to it which means if police were around with a stingray, your phone wouldn't be fooled into connecting to it. \n\nAdmittedly, this isn't very useful when you're carrying your phone on your person in public but it's great for when you're using your cellphone from home.",

Police win and protesters just start getting into smaller numbers until no protesters are left.\n3. China sends in military. (highly unlikely in my opinion.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA portion of protesters are looking for independence from China, some people just want the five demands and keep the one country two systems policy.\n\nSince China is heavily restricted on their exposure to media, China blasts them with propaganda to make protesters seem bad.

When you go from not able to buy a microwave because it's too expensive to owning luxury cars, multiple apartments and making ten times your income in 10 years you tend to trust what your government is doing. The lives of the middle class in China has improved drastically and the government has earned the loyalty of people through progress.\n\nImagine if in 10 years you and everyone you know is making 10 times more money than you do now and owns multiple houses you would be pretty loyal to your government. I don't know why people think the Chinese people are brainwashed and follow the government blindly when in reality they believe the government is truly good for the people of China.\n\nEdit: Holy crap this blew up when I was away. Thanks a bunch for the Gold.\n\nEdit: To elaborate on some of the other issues mentioned. China used to be a very power empire but in the 1800s and 1900s the country declined to the point of ceding parts of its nation to invading countries and being carved up and divided (thus creating Hong Kong and Macau). This shameful history is deeply engraved in the older generations of Chinese people and taught to the younger generations through media/education. However, China became a strong country again under the Communist Party and people I know in China (family and friends so a very small sample size) do not want to give that up for a shot at potential Democracy, especially after what happened in the last US election and with Brexit.\n\nAlso the Chinese people are much less individualist than Westerners. The concept of sacrificing for the greater good is much more engraved in the Chinese (and other Asian) psyche than in the West. For example, when China was building the Three Gorges Dam, it had to move millions of people from the path of the river and most people just followed the government orders, even if it meant leaving everything they knew behind. Another example (not from China but demonstrates this Eastern psyche) is when the Japanese Fukushima nuclear power plant started leaking after an earthquake and some Japanese workers volunteered to stay behind to contain the radiation leak, knowing the risk involved.\n\nI'm not passing judgement on whether the government is right or wrong but simply want people unfamiliar with the Chinese culture to understand a little of the Chinese mentality. After centuries of national humiliation you see your life improve drastically and your country become a super power, you probably are not in a rush for a change in government.",

Lots of conflicts happened in Chinese history, and ultimately, the desire of peace and unity is strongly sought after by a lot of citizens. \n\nHonestly, especially with the recent thrive and Chinese economy, I could hardly blame any of them. There's Taiwanese people that probably feel the same way and want to work with China more, but in general, most Taiwanese want as little to do with Mainland as possible.",

Taiwan then wanted Hong Kong to sign an extradition bill so Taiwan authorities can retrieve the criminal. However, China wanted to butt in and wanted Hong Kong to sign an extradition bill if they sign one with Taiwan. Since China practically controls the government here, the Chief Executive proposed this bill to LegCo, the Legislative Council. Obviously it was refused, but then the Chief Executive kept pushing as well with some pro-China politicians. This started peaceful protests against said extradition bill because if China can grab who they want from Hong Kong, that basically makes Hong Kong part of China's extreme media censorship and retraction of freedom of speech and expression. After the first few marches, university students and other people protested near LegCo, then police was deployed and down goes the spiral.

With \"toxic\" not referring to how the ROC is acting or speaking but their unwanted status easily complicates things.\n\nI used to live in Taiwan and when the topic came up I have never even heard of anyone truly believing that Taiwan should reunify apart from one guy's elderly father. The KMT holds the \"we will eventually reclaim China\" position, but most people seem to think that they've been corrupted by the PRC.\n\nThe only reason most other democracies don't recognize Taiwan is political pressure from the PRC. If you look at when various countries have changed their stance on recognizing Taiwan, it has always been correlated with strong economic incentives or coercion from the PRC.\n\nAn officially independent Taiwan is seen as a threat because they are a lot more complicated to invade, and might make Macau and HK get weird ideas of their own.",

Big brands are already diversifying away from China for cost reasons and for competitive security reasons since the local Chinese partner firms are controlled by the state and steal all the technology and design elements.\n\nPeople already don't like China and don't trust the government there. They just feel stuck because they are flooded with Chinese products.

It would be bad for Hong Kong to demand independece.\n\nEven with the heavy cost, is it still worth it for Hong Kong to be indepedent? The responce will probably differ greatly circle from circle. I think for the most of the protesters they don't currently want indepence, but just maintain our high degree of autonomy and a more democratic government.

Taiwan was occupied by Imperial Japan during the sino Japan wars and WWII. While talking to many Chinese people about these things, they said they feel that the liberation of China from imperialism has not finished until \"all these kidnapped children returned home\" (literally quoting one of the songs a Chinese friend of mine told me about).\n\nWhat's interesting was that when I asked many of them if once China is able to get Hong Kong and Taiwan to \"reunite\", and then these places declare independence, how would they feel about that. And surprisingly most of them said they would then be fine with it if that's indeed what the majority of the people want. A few of them said they would even go out there and support Hong Kong if the the government prevent them from getting what people their wanted.\n\nIt seems that the key problem with 1.4 billion Chinese is the history of past imperialism.",

Instead, you should sing the Chinese Anthem. There are a few reasons to this\n\n1. You're not actually trying to be independent of China, You have no issues being part of China, you only want your rights to be respected and elect a representative that will do what's best for HK instead of doing what China wants. If mainland tourist hears that, they'll fully understand that you guys wants to be chinese, you just strongly disagree with the government. \n\n2. The lyrics actually fits nicely. \n \n\n&gt; \u8d77\u4f86\uff01\u4e0d\u9858\u505a\u5974\u96b8\u7684\u4eba\u5011\n\n&gt; Raise! Those who do not want to be slaves\n\n&gt; - This is exactly what those protester is protesting, they don't want to be slaves of Chinese Government\n\n&gt; \u628a\u6211\u5011\u7684\u8840\u8089\uff0c\u7bc9\u6210\u6211\u5011\u65b0\u7684\u9577\u57ce\uff01\n\n&gt; Using our flesh and blood, to build our new great wall\n\n&gt; - This is what's happening.

                                    "comment": "I agree with this strategy. There is no value to petty ridicule that only exacerbates the anti-China sentiment that the mainland government is exploiting. There is a responsibility of diplomacy in protests, even if you're not a diplomat, because in effect what you're doing as a citizen joining a protest, **is standing up to represent the values and principles that defined your people and state**. The protest is a means to an end, and at no point should one choose means that conflict with one's responsibilities to that end.\n\nI have seen great attitudes and respectable behaviour from the protests, but that goes to waste if a pro-USA theme grows, which will lead HK to become a proxy issue that foreign forces will be hungry to engage with.\n\nThis protest is about defending the rightful autonomy and sovereignty of HK. The protest must remember what the central mission is, because if it loses the relation with what it is to stand for, it will stop being a protest and be just undirected unrest, and that is the worst thing that can happen for HK by their own hands.\n \nAlthough I am open to alternatives, I also think singing the Chinese Anthem could be a powerful tactic to interfere with the mainland's narrative. A huge problem is the mainland Chinese sentiment as a result of the propaganda, which will continue to have effects long after this protest, and deteriorate the HK-Mainland relation both on a political and cultural level. If HK shows itself to be Chinese in their cultural roots that precede politics, it allows for a foundation for future diplomacy and strategy.\n\nEither way I wish HK the best of luck!",

Unlike what some of the other posters here are saying, the Mainland's lack of support is not stemming from the **current** propaganda being put out by the CCP.\n\nIf you have been following the relations between Hong Kong and the Mainland over the past few years, what you will **definitely** notice is that what the Mainland Chinese are saying about Hong Kong in the current protest environment is not any different from what the Mainland has been saying about Hong Kong for the past few years anyway.\n\nRelations between the people of Hong Kong and the people on the Mainland is already poor and a number of viral marketing campaigns in Hong Kong have already caused the sentiment in Mainland China to plummet.\n\nHere are a couple of links to illustrate:\n\nHong Kong media calling Mainland Chinese locusts (this was being parroted at the ground level by many residents as well) :\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-16828134\n\nA series of stereotypes pushed by a Hong Kong design studio that went viral: \n\nhttps://qz.com/442887/how-hong-kong-is-different-from-china-in-a-series-of-offensive-stereotype-based-posters/\n\nThese images go viral in China too and the message they send to the Mainland Chinese is \"The people of Hong Kong look down on us and see us as lessers\"... which if you have spoken to people from Hong Kong, is often not far from the truth.\n\nAs it turns out, when you constantly denigrate and talk down to people from a particular society, the likelihood that they become sympathetic to your causes tends to walk away.\n\nAt the same time, the city of Hong Kong has seen its stature and prosperity relative to the Mainland decline over the past couple of decades, leading many Mainland Chinese to see these recurring waves of unrest as a sign of deep insecurity over Hong Kong's financial and social position, and NOT as a desperate attempt to maintain an autonomous political system.\n\nWhen you add these factors together the answer to the question \n\n&gt; What's the best way to convince Chinese people from the mainland who support the police and denounce the protests?\n\nis simply this:\n\nIt is too late. Hong Kong lost Mainland Chinese support years ago. This support is not coming back. A damned shame as this is largely a self-inflicted wound.",

And yes, some people in Taiwan or Hong Kong will be less-friendly to you if you have a mainlander's accent. \n\nThe truth is that some Taiwanese and Hong Kong people are simply racist towards mainlanders. Some people here in Taiwan still see China as some under-developed country and its population is lowly educated (Though it's only a really really small group of people that has these kind of thoughts). Yet I was in Shanghai for two weeks and this was most definitely not the case at all. It saddens me that through Instagram and other social medias, I see people of my age group being very, very anti-china. They often mock mainlanders not having access to most informations, despite everyone and their grandma in China knows how to use VPN, and the government really ain't doing anything to stop you. Anything China does is \"bad\" (Or even worse, anything partially 'related' to China is bad), and is something that needs to be resisted. The medias aren't helping this situation either, but medias everywhere have always been political, and this is a very complicated issue that I'm simply not knowledgeable enough to speak about.\n\nMost mainlanders, Hong Kongers I've met is all very friendly and well-educated, and it sucks seeing these groups having grudges, or even spites against each other. \n\nI sincerely wish that one day Taiwanese people, mainlanders, and Hong Kongers can get along perfectly, but I'm afraid this is nearly impossible, as these issues were planted long before my generation is born and have reached a point of no return.\n\nI apologize for my weird English writing as this is not my mother tongue.",

They provided funding, advisers, and escape routes for the student leaders (with the help of CIA) so HKA is meant to be the representative of \"Western Democracy\" in the entire movement. They directed the movement from the initial goal of domestic issues, to creating a full democratic government, which was not the initial intent. Not all students were on the same page.\n\nBut, the student leaders, in a sense but not entirely accurately, asked the students to fight, to die for the cause, but they all had golden parachutes. Most of the students, after 1989, felt betrayed. Then they find out one of the leaders, Chai Ling, lied to CNN in the interviews, etc. One thing led to another, HKA's main function in that movement is very questionable, as they were (or had major impacts on) the main decision makers, **because they were the only adults in the room**, the students are technically adults but they are very young. Somehow the decision was to risk everyone's life for the cause, and when the student did, the leaders escaped.\n\nHKA had a bad reputation since then. I am not entirely sure if they know this because Chinese do not talk about it openly.\n\nIt does not help that the current HK movement is trying to use 1989 as a propaganda tool. It will backfire.",

What we actually are hoping for is bloodshed, the moment when the  government is ready to brazenly butcher the people. Only when the Square is awash with blood will the people of China open their eyes.  Only then will they really be united. But how can I explain any of this  to my fellow students?\" And what is truly sad is that some students, and famous well-connected people, are working hard to help the government, to prevent it from taking such measures. For the sake of their selfish interests and their private dealings they are trying to cause our  movement to disintegrate and get us out of the Square before the government becomes so desperate that it takes action....  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Interviewer: \"Are you going to stay in the Square yourself?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Chai Ling: \"No.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Interviewer: \"Why?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Chai Ling: \"Because my situation is different. My name is on the  government's blacklist. I'm not going to be destroyed by this  government. I want to live. Anyway, that's how I feel about it. I don't  know if people will say I'm selfish.

I hope you don't report what I've just said for  the time being, okay?\"\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chai\\_Ling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chai_Ling)\n\nThe american-made documentary itself can be found on youtube: [https://youtu.be/1Gtt2JxmQtg](https://youtu.be/1Gtt2JxmQtg).

The past few weeks have been inundated with blind hatred by many who were previously unaware of the Mainland-Hong Kong dynamic and being led on by certain groups who intended to incite such hatred.\n\nThat being said, the overall frustration from HKers are based in wealth disparity, lack of direct election, and violations of One Country Two Systems (see Causeway Bookstore Disappearances). Despite some reprehensible rhetorics souring the discourse, we shouldn't ignore that the PRC government is ultimately at fault.\n\nThere's a Chinese phrase called \u4ee5\u5fb7\u62a5\u6028 (repaying contempt with grace). I don't want to bother with rebuttals against every incidence of racism because I believe it will diminish across the board once the underlying issues have been addressed. Forcibly abolishing OCTS right now is equivalent to poisoning the well (this metaphorical well poisoning has already happened in Xinjiang due to the government's inability to reconcile pluralism with national cohesion, as well as the authoritarian tendency to resolve things via brute force methods) That is my stance towards Hong Kong and I hope more people can understand this.",

Chinese myself, and this is quite the reality that\u2019s dividing the mainland and HK.\n\nJust some days ago, amidst criticism of the Aug 13 airport incident involving the beating of 2 mainlanders (an alleged policeman and a Global Times reporter), someone posted on Weibo, asking if anyone remembered how HK people stepped up to donate huge amounts of money for the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, that came down to like 2-3k HKD per person. People all say they remember, and call that the dipping point since afterwards, we seem to drift apart. Eventually, the rhetoric became \u201cthose who are rioting were still kids back then. It\u2019s not them who donated.\u201d \n\nTbh, it\u2019s not a \u201cmainland vs HK\u201d issue. Even those who speak out loudest against the movement would claim to love HK and China, and I don\u2019t doubt in their mind they truly feel that. The mainland media focuses on reports of non-participating HK citizens whose lives are disrupted by the protests, and they get tons of sympathy. \n\nSo yeah...it\u2019s a twisted relationship, but definitely not broken. But if things go on, I don\u2019t think I can remain optimistic.",

I remember the first time I went to China as a student, we visited Tsinghua University and got to discuss about Taiwan and Hong Kong with the local students. The responses were overwhelmingly positive at the time. It was right after the Asian Financial crisis and there seem to be a lot of optimism amongst the mainland students that all three sides can cooperate more in the future and make a better China. Every few years I would go back and visit these friends who are now all across the country and some in Hong Kong. I can feel that optimism fading more and more. I remember them telling me that last time I visited right after the Yellow Umbrella protests that the optimism and idealism is one sided. Hong Konger do not want to have anything to do with them. \n\nThat's sad because Hong Kong could have been the leader in many fronts in China. It's a financial capital with a stable mature legal system. It's a net exporter of culture and democratic values. It's the biggest preserver of Cantonese Language and Culture. The Canton region is over 100 million people and immensely wealthy by China standard. That's a formidable political block to influence Beijing in many ways, including allowing more democratic reforms to take place. It's sad that the opportunity was lost. Hong Kong fell behind the curve. They have a whole generation of kids with no hope because they refused to reform they land policies to take care of their own people. Instead it's become a play ground for the rich.",

The reason HongKong is such a major hub is because it's the gateway to China for many years. Despite this, HK acts like they're above China for the greater part of a century. This along with the sentiment of HK seeing the mainland as lesser people only helps fuel the flames even more.\n\nTo the mainland, HK is seen as a spoiled brat who is throwing a tantrum for being contested by other major cities and the pearl river delta. It's no wonder why mainland Chinese are pro-CCP when they're just fed a bit more of the violent parts of the protest/riot.",

There is no negotiation, no trust and no willingness to move forward from the protesting side, which means there is already nothing that the government can do to placate them. As far as I can see the protest is now nothing more than a continued expression of their frustrations, it no longer serves any higher purpose than just to crash burn and bring the rest of HK down with it.\n\nMy understanding is that in civilized countries, democratic or otherwise, the leader generally does not generally have power to interfer with police or the law directly.\n\nMany of the demands (e.g. for Carrie Lam to to release the arrested and grant them immunity) just seems unreasonable and unrealistic when their leader does not, and should not, have the power to dictate the legal system.",

I think that, considering the small fraction of violent rioters, 40-60% of violence is fake, caused by undercover police, triads, and Chinese police.",

Just wanna say fully support the peaceful protests and it's amazing what you guys have achieved. Seeing the images of the 2 million people March was breathtaking. My questions to you:\n\n1. The standard of living and economic equality gap is pretty large in HK. The government is not doing a huge amount to improve it. Do you think this fact is part of the reason why protests are so emotive, and what is the best way to address this moving forward? \n\n2. Carrie Lam and a large number of HK politicians have been almost non existent since the protests started, if she did resign is there anyone in HK you would stand behind? What does the next leader have to do to impress you.\n\n3. In regards to point number 5 in the demands. Whilst the HK police have been pretty awful, there are some extremist protesters who have caused real harm. Building vandalism, petrol bombs, violence (in the extreme forms) etc, if individual members of the police are to be held accountable for their acts of brutality, should the protesters not be too? \n\nThanks again, good luck in the coming months!",

However, I'm sure some protesters fight for just a better place to live here. The disparity is quite big, but this probably isn't the reason why the protests are so emotive. I think it's bursting with emotion and passion because the Hong Kong people are fed up of being oppressed.\n2. If Carrie Lam did resign, then we don't know who will be Chief Executive next. Honestly, I don't really know the Hong Kong politicians, so I don't know who to stand behind.\n3. The fifth point in the demands is to free anyone arrested because of protests. The HKPF has been terrible and yes, I don't at all deny the fact that some protesters caused violence and harm. However, people need to keep in mind that this is only a small portion of the protesters. However, there is evidence that undercover police dressed up as protesters hurled petrol bombs to make it seem like protesters caused extreme violence. Real protesters should definitely be held accountable for their actions but if caught, there should be a less harsh sentence.\n\nThis is all just in my opinion.",

If thier purpose was to be symbolic or pander for attention, they may have succeeded even if just a little... However such an act is also a double edge sword, as the media of the host country can show these videos without even spinning the story and the viewers would see it as a traitorist act. It would only push the rest of the country away. Change has to come from within not from the outside. Something these HK protestor doesn't seem to understanding.",

If you ask the average mainlander they *want* the CCP to send in the PAP and crush the protests once and for all. For reasons I\u2019m not going to get into, that\u2019s most likely not going to happen. However even Mainlanders abroad, with access to non-Chinese news about the protests still don\u2019t support them. In their view HKers are a bunch of spoiled brats who just want to trash shit for fun.\n\n\nThere is also a lot of bad blood between mainlanders and Hong Kongers. Hong Kongers used to look down on the mainland as a bunch of \u201ccountry hicks\u201d because they were poor. Now the situation is reversed and a bunch of rich mainlanders go to HK every year to buy luxury goods, safe baby formula, tour around, etc. in response to the influx a lot of HKers have taken to calling mainlanders \u201clocusts\u201d and accuse them of \u201cinvading Hong Kong\u201d. This isn\u2019t helped by a lot of the nouveau riches mainlanders not having the western style manners and upbringing to go along with their stacks of cash. \n\n\nThe discrimination against mainlanders is bad enough that when I visited relatives in Zhuhai, across the bay from Hong Kong, my parents warned me to speak English to each other in HK instead of mandarin so we don\u2019t get profiled.",

    "postText": "PROOF: https://i.redd.it/gpyb6vjgg5va1.png\n\nHey Reddit - Happy Earth Day Eve from the Pacific Crest Trail! Last year, we announced our plans to embark on the largest-ever trail trash survey, and now we're doing it. For the next five months, we\u2019ll be living in the backcountry and hiking the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail to study and document litter along the way. We're already 200 miles in! Our goal is to use the data we collect to create solutions for keeping our natural resources clean and pristine.\n\nOur team is here to answer your questions:\n\nVictoria McGruer, has her Ph.D. in Ecotoxicology studying pollution in the environment and is currently hiking the Pacific Crest Trail and leading the litter survey.\n\nMacy Gustavus, has her M.S. in Watershed Sciences studying microplastic pollution in river systems. She joined our mission after seeing our AMA last year and is now a core team member leading microplastic sampling along the trail.\n\nWin Cowger, a data scientist with a Ph.D. in Environmental Science, focuses on trash research and is currently working at the Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research.\n\nEmin Israfil, the lead developer at Rubbish, is a fellow trash and data enthusiast who will provide tech support to ensure all the litter data is captured throughout the journey.\n\nWe invite you all to participate along your local trails. Logging the clean spots is just as important as logging the dirty spots. \n\nWe're excited to share our progress and discoveries with you! Follow our project @notracetrails on Instagram or  www.notracetrails.com.",

We aren\u2019t currently collecting plant samples but totally agree that there likely are microplastics depositing on plants. Win even coauthored a piece about leaf microplastics (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2023.101651). We are collecting background samples of microplastics off of the trail in untouched soils to compare that from microplastics on the trail itself. We don\u2019t know for sure yet what source most of the microplastics are coming from but it is totally possible that microplastics are blowing from roads onto the trail.",

I am starting to turn the corner from \"Leave no trace\" to \"Stay out because we've determined you will leave a trace\". Personal accountability vs govt regulation and all that. I think there are too many people, with too many various effects both known and unknown, to tell someone \"hey if you are careful you won't hurt nature!\"",

Most technical and backpacking gear is made out of plastic, even our shoes are shedding microplastics while we walk. We\u2019re working and sharing data with Marmot, an outdoor brand committed to reducing their microfiber impact and Materevolve, a textile consulting firm focused on exploring alternative fabrics to synthetics, to work towards a cleaner outdoor industry. In the meantime, we\u2019re collecting data to understand more about what impact these microplastics have on backcountry environments.",

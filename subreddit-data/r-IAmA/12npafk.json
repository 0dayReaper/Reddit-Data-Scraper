The first four meters of the lanes were about half  a meter wide, and then the lanes widened to fill width. I think the balls were smaller than a five pin bowling ball, and may not have been round, but that part is hazy. Apparently it is common for groups to play together for years, with strange rituals. There were a few different games and pin arrangements and it was a hell of a lot of fun.",

By the time it clears the oil it will have a lot of rotation(if thrown right) and the increased friction will cause it to *hook*.\n\n There's a ton of physics involved that I can't even begin to understand, much less explain. And myriad factors that will effect when it curves and how much. Everything from the ball's outside material(coverstock) and level of polish(finish) to exactly where the finger holes are drilled relative to the inner weight. And that's just the ball. There's different oil patterns, how many games have been played on the lane since it was oiled, how much spin the people playing on it have and what lines they take. Etc etc. A lot of serious bowlers bring multiple balls to switch to as the lane conditions change.\n\n Long story short: If you wanna start throwing a hook buy a Brunswick Rhino and get it drilled for a hook. Then go practice a lot until you decide you need a better, more expensive, ball.",

                    "comment": "If you had gone in through the door to the back of house like the mechanics, you\u2019d see a long room with each pinsetter, arrayed [like this.](https://i.redd.it/4jf5kmizcdn21.jpg) These are the pinsetter types I work on, but there are several different types and formats. Some newer pinsetters use strings to lift and respot the pins after each frame. Ive only ever worked on Brunswick A2s so I can\u2019t speak for any other pinsetters. It\u2019s not too exciting and a bit loud and dusty, but it is pretty cool to see all of the machines running at once. In some bowling centers the pinsetters are right up against the back of the wall, making maintenance a nightmare. In our case the wall behind the pinsetters is full of small cubbies with spare parts and tools. Boxes of pins and spare balls at one end, and a back room with a small desk for paperwork, ordering parts, keeping track of maintenance and repairs, playing Tetris, etc. \n\nIf the hypothetical is now that a 6 year old girl walks down a bowling lane and crawls onto the pin deck (the area at the end of the lane underneath the pinsetter where the pins are spotted for you to bowl) things become a bummer. If the cycling of the machine is triggered by a software, as most are these days, there are usually two lasers that shine across the lane and hit reflectors on the other side. When a ball rolls down the lane and cuts both lasers, the software knows that a ball has rolled down the lane and how fast it\u2019s going, by calculating the time between both lasers being tripped. It will wait longer to cycle if the ball is slower, to ensure any wobbling pins have time to fall down. If your feet don\u2019t trip or only trip one of the lasers, you\u2019d get to the end of the lane and nothing would happen, the machine would continue to idle waiting for a ball. If your feet tripped both lasers on the way down the lane, when you crawled onto the pin deck the rake would come down behind you and the machine would begin to cycle. It would sweep you backwards with a very big smack. At the back end of the pin deck is the pit cushion, a big steel plate covered in black canvas that pivots backwards to absorb the force and shock of the bowling ball. This raises up when the rake comes down, and the rake would try to sweep you and the pins underneath it. Most likely you\u2019d get swept off the back of the pin deck onto the shaker board, a downward sloping fiberglass board that shakes the pins backwards so they can be collected by the pinwheel and taken back up top. So you\u2019d find yourself jammed underneath a big steel plate with ten pins, being shaken pretty violently by a board underneath you, with several choices. Your best bet would be to try to climb out of the back of the pinsetter, which is tricky since there\u2019s are two big wheels spinning in opposite directions and several places to get a finger taken off or pinched. Hopefully a pin chaser in the back hears you crying for help and hits the breaker on the pinsetter and helps you out. Still, you could manage to do it on your own with enough care and fortitude. \n\nGoing back out the front of the pinsetter at this point is a gamble. If the machine hasn\u2019t completed the cycle yet, the deck, a massive, immensely heavy metal casting, will be coming down soon to set ten new pins onto the pin deck. If you find yourself underneath it when it does so, I\u2019m pretty confident it would be enough to kill a six year old. It\u2019s a pretty morbid hypothetical unfortunately. If it wasn\u2019t heavy enough to kill you, it would certainly break some bones while dropping ten pins on you to add insult to injury. If you cower on the shaker board though and wait for the cycle to finish and for the new pins to be reset, I suppose you could clamber your way out the front and run back down the lane. So I guess in a way, the pinsetters are an enchanted portal to another world, but it\u2019s a one way trip sometimes.",

    "postText": "The film is called a A Run for More. It will be available to stream for free on PBS until mid-August. Watch it here: [https://www.pbs.org/video/a-run-for-more-fkvzy1/](https://www.pbs.org/video/a-run-for-more-fkvzy1/)\n\nABOUT THE FILM:\n\nAs a corporate executive, political campaigner, military spouse, and proud Latinx daughter, Frankie Gonzales-Wolfe is used to fighting for other people\u2019s causes. But when she decides to campaign as the first trans woman to run for city council in her hometown of San Antonio, Texas, she faces a different kind of challenge\u2014and this time it\u2019s personal. Filmed over the course of three years, this moving documentary follows Frankie as she embarks on her 2019 campaign, drawing on the strength she needed when recovering from a pre-transition assault. Now happily married to a loving, supportive husband and surrounded by a loyal team of volunteers and friends, Frankie takes on the fight of her life. Shot in intimate cinema-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style, A Run for More follows Frankie\u2019s political and personal journey of discovery over the course of her historic campaign, and what she uncovers about herself along the way is as eye-opening as the reactions she receives from the community she hopes to represent.\n\nProof:  [arunformore.com](https://arunformore.com) //  [https://imgur.com/a/0RJpI73](https://imgur.com/a/0RJpI73)",

Campaign work is often monotonous and they both always found a way to keep things light. No matter how the campaign was going, they were always having fun. I laughed a lot in that campaign office while filming.\n\nThe most difficult part of filming with Frankie was when she was being verbally attacked for being who she is. Even though I knew it was going to happen, it\u2019s still hard to see someone you care about go through a negative experience simply because of her identity.",

I think the most surprising thing was the importance that candidates placed on making sure they had campaign signs all over their communities. The amount of strategy and resources around the campaign signs was super surprising to me! We even included a discussion of signs in the documentary! For the incumbent candidates, it definitely seemed like a statement of strength to put hundreds of big 4 foot by 6 foot signs across a city council district. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne other thing I learned about and was surprised by is that because San Antonio city council is nonpartisan, there are occasionally weird political alliances that form on a wide range of issues.",

Thank you!\n\nHere's an extremely incomplete list of some of my favorite documentaries: \n\nCameraperson by Kirsten Johnson\n\nMinding The Gap by Bing Liu\n\nCrime and Punishment by Steve Maing\n\nWhat We Leave Behind by Iliana Sosa\n\nOn Her Shoulders by Alexandria Bombach\n\nKnock Down the House by Rachel Lears\n\nHale County This Morning, This Evening by RaMell Ross\n\nCrisis and The War Room by D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus\n\nOverburden by Chad Stevens \n\nThe Territory by Alex Pritz\n\nFather Soldier Son by Leslye Davis\n\nBuilding The American Dream by Chelsea Hernandez\n\nThe Overnighters by Jesse Moss\n\nIf I try to sum up a commonality in this group of filmmakers, it's that they share a commitment to the people with whom they work. These filmmakers take the time to really get to know the participants and honor the trust they've built in that relationship. I also think they exercise patience as a project unfolds. \n\nYou cannot rush good storytelling. \n\nMost of my favorite documentary films unfold in the present tense. If the filmmaker doesn\u2019t know how the story will turn out, then the narrative suspense in the film is genuine. For example, when I filmed A Run for More, I didn\u2019t know whether Frankie would win her election. The film unfolds in a way where you see Frankie find out the election results in real time. \n\nI am also really intrigued by more non-linear storytelling like Jessica Bashir\u2019s Faya Dayi or Ascension by Jessica Kingdon.",

                    "comment": "The hardest lesson I took away from making this film is that making a film is hard! Every aspect of the filmmaking process challenged me and required patience, sacrifice, tenacity and resources. If I knew in 2016 what I know now about making a film, I would have pursued this process in a completely different way. The youthful naivete helped me in some ways, though!\n\nThis was my first documentary feature and so there were so many things that I had never experienced before. I work as a cameraperson for a living so I had a sense of how to do the filming part of the film, but most of everything else was something new. \n\nPutting together a good story in the edit was hard! Katrina and I spent many many hours on the phone discussing how to shape the edit and the storyline. We had more than 100 hours of footage and infinite choices on how to put it together. \n\nFundraising is hard! This is particularly true when you don\u2019t have any credibility because you\u2019ve never made a feature before. We got rejected from more than 75 grants along the way. \n\nNavigating distribution is hard and it\u2019s getting harder. True crime and celebrity docs are dominant and this film is neither of those things. Secondarily, platforms are producing more in-house docs and acquiring fewer films out of festivals. Big shoutout to Reel South and PBS for distributing this movie on TV.  A shoutout also to Indie Rights, The Film Collaborative, and Collective Eye Films, who are helping us out with digital distribution, festival distribution, and educational distribution.  \n\nA final shoutout to everyone on the film team who was a part of getting the film to the finish line, including: \n\nProducer: Andre Perez\n\nEditor: Katrina De Vera\n\nExecutive Producer: PJ Raval\n\nExecutive Producer: Monique Gabriela Curnen\n\nImpact Producer/Associate Producer/Assistant Editor: Zander Cole Karlin\n\nMusic Composer: Nicolas Repetto",

That takes real courage and her determination really moved me. I should also say that I met Frankie back in 2016 when she was a volunteer for the Clinton campaign in San Antonio, Texas.

Our goal is to partner with local LGBTQ+ organizations to screen the film as a tool to gather community and cultivate conversations about transgender empowerment and representation in politics. So far  we've partnered with 22 organizations for screenings across the country, from places like Chicago and Brooklyn to places like Spencer, Indiana and Birmingham, Alabama. It's been really rewarding to screen the film in partnership with these community organizations because the conversations have been super in-depth. We've been lucky to have Frankie join many of the screenings virtually as well! You can learn more about those partners and our screening tour here: [https://www.arunformore.com/por](https://www.arunformore.com/por)\n\nInitially, we were going to do the tour for 6 weeks but we're going to keep it going at least through pride month. If any organization wants to host a screening of the film, we have a super simple screening request form you can fill out: [https://www.arunformore.com/host-a-screening](https://www.arunformore.com/host-a-screening)\n\nDuring our festival run last year, we also partnered with local LGBTQ+ community organizations. At each festival Q&amp;A, we tried to have a representative from a local organization join us on stage and talk about the state of transgender rights wherever the screening was taking place. We also used the Q&amp;A as an opportunity for the organization to talk about their mission and current activities.",

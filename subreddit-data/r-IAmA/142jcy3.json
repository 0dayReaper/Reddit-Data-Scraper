Gary VanDeaver previously said the overhaul could help \u201cbring students back into community college\u201d by making it more affordable after the steep enrollment drops such institutions saw in the last few years.\n\nIf the legislation is adopted by Gov. Greg Abbott, high school students from low-income families could also enroll in dual credit courses at no cost through a new Financial Aid for Swift Transfer program.\n\n[You can read more on the legislation here](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/2023/04/12/texas-community-colleges-eager-for-state-funding-revamp-would-get-hundreds-of-millions/).",

However, Ricki Korba, a 23-year-old student from California, said she wouldn't rely on artificial intelligence software for her coursework because \"there's just some things it just gets wrong.\"\n\nShe also added some professors use unreliable tools that scan students' work and note if it was created by AI or not, noting that people have uploaded the Constitution of the United States to test it out. The website said AI had been used.\n\nStill, some professors recommend it for things like cover letters, Korba said. She believes there's still a long way to go before colleges, students, teachers and administrators adapt to such tools and is unsure about what AI's impact will be on higher education.",

But some schools and individual teachers leaned into the new technology, teaching students how to use it to their benefit.\n\nThis required a firmer grasp on evaluating the quality and bias of sources, and it taught lifelong lessons associated with such practices.\n\nI would argue this is no different.\n\nTeachers should embrace new technologies, especially ones that are likely to become valued in the job market.\n\nThis is off the top of my head, but if I taught literature, for example, I would introduce my students to Chat GPT and have them come up with three questions that yield valuable information on the theme, cultural context, and impact of a novel or poem we are reading. Then they evaluate the AI response they feel they could use it in a professional capacity. They would have to turn in the questions they came up with, the AI responses, and their evaluation.\n\nBased on recent trends, it seems AI is here to stay. Teachers can spend their time policing students to ensure they follow trends of the past, or they can prepare them for an evolving job market that will value experience using artificial intelligence.\n\nSigned,\n\nA Struggling Two-Time Dropout from Cincinnati State Technical and Community College",

I worry that a narrow \"building skills\"-focused conversation risks losing what makes American higher education great.  Even community colleges that do have a mission to train people for jobs do so much more than that-- and a vibrant American middle class comprised of informed and engaged citizens depends on that broader mission continuing into the future. Just my opinion, but we need to resist the temptation to whittle down community college to \\*just\\* a place you go to learn specific skills/to meet employers' immediate demands for skilled workers.  FWIW, we know can't predict the job needs of the future economy with absolute certainty and a community college education should last a lifetime, so we should try to do more.",

However, there are also inter-state transfer and articulation policies. States like Florida have done a great job standardizing lower-division courses and implemented common course numbering for ease of transferability/course evaluation. Further, like Florida, Virginia has developed a General Education certificate which allow for more flexibility when transferring between state-institutions without an Associates degree. The Interstate Passport seeks to expand a similar model on a multi-state level ([https://interstatepassport.wiche.edu/](https://interstatepassport.wiche.edu/)). The Education Commission of the States provides a breakdown of transfer policy, including general metrics and state-specific policy: [https://www.ecs.org/50-state-comparison-transfer-and-articulation/](https://www.ecs.org/50-state-comparison-transfer-and-articulation/) . As a transfer student, I recommend connecting with your community college\u2019s transfer office to learn more about your state policies as well as any articulation agreements your institution has with particular universities.",

The college then implemented success coaches \u2014 who not only provide academic advising or help with financial aid applications, but also anticipate barriers.\n\nOverall, success coaches help students navigate the college and connect them to free resources they may need \u2014 such as childcare, food pantries or bus passes \u2014 in efforts to reduce the amount of students who drop out of school. \n\n[You can read my full story on this here (all of The Dallas Morning News Education Lab content is in front of the paywall!)](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/2023/05/22/how-success-coaches-dig-a-little-deeper-to-anticipate-and-tackle-dallas-college-students/)\n\n\\- Valeria Olivares\n\n**California \u2014** In California, a common issue I see, talking with both my cohort from community college as well as other students in my transfer institution, is credits not transferring over perfectly. Many students from a range of majors have had classes that should have had their credits transferred but simply have not.\n\nAnother issue I have seen is the culture shock of being a transfer student on a CSU/UC/Private campus. In my experience, it was hard to adjust to both the campus culture and the city I moved to.\n\n\\- Ricki Korba\n\n**Virginia \u2014** Online education has obviously done a lot for college access, however, if there is not a stable internet connection, rural students will continue to struggle with degree completion. Affordability continues to be top of mind as well. Our program (and a growing number of others) looks to alleviate this for students within a specific income-level through a last-in grant, called the Mason Virginia Promise.\n\nOpportunities such as this, particularly those that do not require an application, can support low-income students\u2019 continuous enrollment, which increases likelihood of degree completion.

More men are going to college now (well, 2018 because I couldn't find more recent numbers) than they were in 1980, both in absolute numbers and as a proportion of the male population.\n\nI am going to avoid the scope-creep of engaging with each point in the article you shared and just summarize my view by saying: yes, there are certainly measures by which women lead men, and in the long-run I think getting gender-parity is a good goal for most measures.  However, where many issues that women have faced or continue to face have called for gender-targeted solutions, I think most issues that men face today would be best resolved with non-gender-targeted solutions.  Ending the war on drugs would resolve the bulk of the male incarceration problem, as well as knock-on effects like violent victimization of males.  Background checks for gun purchases would reduce the male-female suicide completion gap (note that it's a suicide completion gap - women are about as likely to attempt suicide, just more likely to survive it).",

I'm Mike Pierce, with the Student Borrower Protection Center and one of the experts on the AmA today.\n\nThere are a number of state and local \"promise\" programs that deliver free community college at scale, sometimes universally and sometimes targeted to lower- or middle-income families.  We expect we'll see more of these over time.\n\nWe also know that the cost of community college is more than just tuition-- people give up working, or work through college, need to keep a roof over their heads and food on their tables.  Figuring out wraparound support for students is a key part of making \"Free\" community college actually work and part of why Washington, DC has struggled to deliver a national answer that meets students' needs.",

We unfortunately have not extensively researched this topic, so we can't directly answer all of your questions.\n\n\r  \nIA textbooks have become more popular in recent years, with many institutions offering the option. Ricki Korba, current college student and former community college student, said that her school has been trying to do more zero-cost textbooks and most are digital copies. She said her professors prefer digital textbooks so there\u2019s more access. This was also the case at her former community college.\n\n\r  \nAccording to [https://www.inclusiveaccess.org/](https://inclusiveaccess.org), the advantages of the IA model seem to mainly be lowering costs for textbooks and providing a more accessible option for students. However, that may not include the costs of used textbooks, which could ultimately be cheaper.\n\n\r  \nThere is also speculation on how much IA textbooks have improved academic outcomes overall. Additionally, there is another alternative called [Open Educational Resources (OER)](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-educational-resources).",

            "comment": "Why do you insist that communtiy colleges are failing while ignoring the fact that the majority of our students do not plan to transfer to a four year college?  \n\nOur prof tech programs are absolutely thriving.  Seems to me that peoples priorities have changed, not many people want to be saddled with 100k in debt and waste four years to get a worthless degree in 18th century French liturature when they could have nursing school,  areospace manufacturing, or cybersecurity certificates practically paid for,  then get professional certifications that lead to living wage jobs.  \n\nPerhaps universities have bloated their costs out of the competitive market, have ignored the plight of disadvantaged and minority students, and gatekept too effectively to be relevant, so no one wants to transfer to them.  Acadmeic snobbery is so 20th century!  The AA transfer programs may be dying off as more students become aware of the pitfalls of highr ed, but there are waitlists for many of our prof tech programs.  \n\nThe reporting you all are doing is damaging to a system that you claim is already failing-are you trying to discourage people from enrolling?  Can you imagine being a student at a CC and reading these reports?  Why keep attending if its all a failure anyway, right?\n\nWhat is the end goal here, and who is funding this project?  My guess is university special interests.  The same folks who push the idea that EVERY high schooler needs a college goal and a four year degree to even get started in life, and make those who dont have these goals feel like failures in high school.  Or the \"bachelors is the new hs diploma, and masters is the new bachelors\" crowd.  The same group that wants you to pay $350 for a book they published and now require as course materials (cha-ching!).  If everyone is a statistician, doctor, or MBA, who is going to fix the toilet or keep the heat on in the winter?\n\nCommunity colleges remain an excellent value and the quickest way to gainful employment.  Our goal is to eliminate barriers to eduation, and we are stuck cleaning up the woefully poor outcomes the k-12 system produces. My program enjoys 100% job placement for any student who seeks employment upon completion. Not all do, but that isnt the colleges fault, is it now? \n\nWe not only have to teach students to read and do math that they should have learned in 5th grade, thus making up for K-12s failings, but we deliver on teaching skills relevant and nessecary to the modern workforce.  \n\nI read an article you produced from this project a few weeks ago and shared it wih my collegues at our community college.  It was widely panned as a special interest opinion peice and our journalism professor had some very poigniant insights to how stories like this come about.\n\nAccording to him:\n\"As ad revenue goes away from news publications, reporters lose their jobs do to lack of funding.  This creates a vacuum.  \n\nEnter into this vacuum think tanks (Saving the College Dream in this case) that offer free \"journalism\" to fill the gap.\n\nThe think tank will be funded by people or corporate entities who think there is an issue with the way a topic has been covered.  They then fund \"reporters\" (your \"experts\") to write stories for free within established publications (The Dallas Morning News)  sometimes they actually show up in person and are given desks next to real news reporters.\n\nWhat they turn out is pure PR or opinion (like this series of articles), often produced by trust fund \"revolutionaries\" who feel they are doing the noble job of \"changing journalism\" but are really just meeting their own ideological or special interest ends.\n\nThe Journalism Solutions Network seems to be just such an outfit.\n\nI wouldnt waste my time contacting the reporter.  Contact the editor/publisher and let them know you are on to what they are doing and that you are questioning the integrity of their publication.  This will have a much bigger impact.\"\n\nThis guy is a Poynter-Koch Fellow, so he is legit, what are your credentials?  \n\nInstead of focusing on \"what community colleges do wrong\", why not focus on areas we thrive in?  Wouldn't that be more contructive? \n\nCould it be that this entire project is a front for private Big Ed/Student Loan sharks to get students to enroll straight to university for undergrad work, thus racking up astronomical loans that could have been avoided by attending a community college?\n\nYou highlight a handful of students whose ed plan was not strong to begin with and hold them as evidence that the entire system is a failure.  I could present to you dozens that the system worked flawlessly for, myself being one of them.  \n\nAgain, what is your end goal?  Why not highlight the good these colleges do for society, how we break generational poverty and open doors for poor, underserved populations, how we enrich working class and minority communities, and are often the first stop for first generation and/or immigrant college students (who fail out at a high rate at universities, too, if they are even allowed in in the first place)?\n\nHow can you defend such skewed opinion peices as anything but that, let alone call it reporting or journalism?  This is similar to Tucker Carlson pontificating on the failures of America.  But I would bet you guys blast the folks over at Fox News as clowns (rightfully so).  Then you turn around and do the same thing to the community college system, with no regard for the damage it causes.  \n\nCasting stones isnt the same thing as objective reporting, and some of us can see right through this thin curtain and see the special intrests at work behind the scenes, just like a sinister Dr. Oz trying to convince a bunch of Munchkins he knows all.",

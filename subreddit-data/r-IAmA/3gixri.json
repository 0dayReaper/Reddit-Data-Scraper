    "postText": "Ronda here. My favorite Pokemon is Mew and I used to moderate a Pokemon forum. I'm an active player on WOW and a Mage named Randa on TaichiPanda \u2013 I\u2019m on the 3rd Game Of Thrones book and will shank a bitch who tries to give shit away about the series cause you watched the show already. \n \nOh, and I'm also the UFC Bantamweight Champion and undefeated in MMA. I'm here today to answer your questions with the help of my friends Bobby and Leo. \n\nAs many of you already know, I get a **lot** of questions about femininity and body image. Women are constantly being made to feel the need to conform to an almost unattainable standard of what\u2019s considered attractive so they can support a multitude of industries buying shit in the pursuit of reaching this standard. \n\nSo, I've decided to expand my support of the charity Didi Hirsch with their work in the field of women's body issues, and have partnered with Represent.com to [release a limited edition \"don't be a D.N.B.\" shirt](http://represent.com/ronda), with a portion of proceeds benefiting this amazing cause. (For those of you who don't know- a \"D.N.B.\" is a \"Do Nothing Bitch\")\n\nI'll be answering your questions for the next ~34 seconds, so I'll have plenty of time for 50+ thoughtful answers.\n**AMA**!\n\n[Proof](https://twitter.com/RondaRousey/status/630885903121055744)!\n\n**EDIT**: Thanks so much for the awesome questions! Gotta head out now, but it's been real, its been fun....its been real fun - thanks reddit!",

And I feel like I have so much extra space in my brain now that I'm not constantly thinking about the next meal and trying to eat as much as possible every day while still losing weight. I feel amazing. I (think) I look amazing. And I just ate some bomb-ass french toast this morning.

You have a choice to cry or laugh at them. My mom chose to laugh more than cry. Kids can be mean and if they think they have an edge on you they will press it. If being called James bothers you then figure out how to make it not bother you. Either find a way to make a private joke that makes you laugh or come up with some witty one-liners to throw back with a smile (such as, (if it's a guy) *laugh*, \"jealous much?\" or *laugh* \"Don't worry, I won't beat you in arm wrestling in front of the other kids\" (not sure what to say if it's a girl, a fit girl can help with that.). Once they see it doesn't bother you it will either become a loving nickname or just go away. Or you can ignore it. You most likely won't make it go away by challenging it so I wouldn't recommend that path.    \n\nI have 10 sisters of whom I am older than most of them. Several of them were \"tomboys\". One of my sisters has a gimp hand that is useless to her. That has never stopped her. One day a guy was trying to get me to fight him at school. He started talking about how he was going to hurt my sister with the bad hand. I laughed at him, I told him to give it a shot and if he asked nicely I would pull my sister off of him after she beat his ass. Her one arm was weak, but the other arm was twice as strong as any one arm. The funny thing about her is she does what she wants and is so used to it that when people try to slow her down because of her arm she just brushes by them. She doesn't let other predefined idea's about what she can do or how she should look or anything define her. She doesn't let other peoples ignorance bother her. She started a business, figured out how to drive, and has done everything she has wanted to by herself if she must or with support if others will help.    \n\nMost people don't have a passion when they are 20, much less 13. Don't let other people deprive you of your passion, keep on with your passion and ignore or educate those who mock you. And if they can't get on board then leave them in your dust. Ignoring is hard, but after some practice it's gets easy (and fun)(\"huh? You were talking to me? I thought you were calling someone names james...\", \"james? who is that? I'm Maximax12, I can't believe you don't know my name....\")\n\nI know I am not Ronda, but I hope this helps. I would love it if my sisters started learning to defend themselves and when I look at girls to date I look for fit girls. If they can fight, that's sexy, not intimidating. ",

I know for a fact she can make the weight. She consulted with Mike Dolce (my current nutritionist) before I ever started working with him and after consulting with her he said he could get her in \"the best shape of her life\" at 135. She then started being represented by Tito Ortiz and all talk stopped. The delay is all about money, not her weight. She made 145 pumped full of steroids. She can healthily make 135 without them. Her shows that she headlines lose thousands of dollars, and the majority of the tickets are given away because no one will buy them. She *needs* me. So pretty much we're waiting for her to realize that she needs to fight me before I retire or she'll never have enough money to retire. I would like me kicking her ass be my retirement fight but whether she steps up or not I'll walk away undefeated and happily ever after regardless.\n\n\nDo I think I would legit beat Mayweather in a ruleless fight? Floyd is one of the best boxers of all time. He would definitely beat me in a boxing match. I unfortunately don't get into \"matches\". I *fight* for a living. In a no rules fight, I believe I can beat **anyone** on this planet. Boxing is a sweet science with strict rules that I respect very much and aspire every day to improve at. But you said ruleless fight, and that's my honest answer.\n\nI'd be surprised if Mike Tyson returned to the ring but could imagine he would do it in a charity kind of capacity, and if so good for him. \n\nRing rust is a real serious thing that is hard to overcome and of course I wish Fedor the best but that much of a lay off would affect anyone's performance, which is why I fight so often.",

I've had confidence problems (which teenager hasn't?). I'd never played sports in my life and I didn't think I could ever be athletic. You're my hero and you inspire me to do the best that I can in everything I do. Now I'm training in mma (judo based) and one day I hope to be the UFC Bantamweight Champion too, after you retire ofc. Thanks for changing my life. Sorry this is pretty jumbled, kind of freaking out. When I meet you I swear I'm going to really lose it and cry! Just answer one of my questions and you'll make my life, lol!\n\nQ: What would be the coolest fighter nickname? I need one for when I go pro!\n\nQ: How do you feel about Fedor's comments about you and women's mma?\n\nQ: When are you coming to New York again?\n\nQ: How tolerant are you of eyebrow plucking? My mom tells me to suck it up because you probably do, but I hate it!\n\nQ: Do you still train with Gokor? And could you drop by his seminar on September 13th if you happen to be in New York?\n",

Keep it up, and don't let anyone tell you differently!\n\nEdit: Shit, Reddit! Thank you for all the upvotes. Each and every one of you is doing something as awesome as this girl is, you just don't know it yet! If you're having a good day, keep on going. If you're having a shitty one, remember that if everything around you is terrible, you're still awesome for being able to go through it a step at a time.

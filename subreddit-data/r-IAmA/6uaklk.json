    "postText": "Hi Reddit, my name is Colin Warner and you read that headline right. I was arrested in 1980 for the murder of a young man in New York City even though I was on the other side of town when it happened. I wasn\u2019t exonerated until 2001. With me is Phil Desgranges, a staff attorney with the New York Civil Liberties Union who can help answer some of the more legal-based questions you might have. I\u2019ve also included links to a website with a timeline of events you can reference, as well as the trailer for Crown Heights, an Amazon Studios movie coming out tomorrow that\u2019s based on my true story. AMA.\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/CrownHeightsMOV/status/897808822152163328\nhttps://twitter.com/CrownHeightsMOV/status/897916854068432897\n\nMy Timeline: http://crownheightsthemovie.com/\n\nCrown Heights Trailer: https://youtu.be/JgrFRyMsWiY\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone so much for your time and questions. That's all the time I have for now, but your questions have truly touched me. Hopefully some of my answers did the same for you.",

I spent 3 days in jail for cops accusing me of having prescription pills that were for a dislocated shoulder at the time, for selling purposes. They even took me to a dr to verify if my shoulder in a sling was indeed broken, and still took me to jail and tried to charge me with a felony that would have put me away for 6 years. Had to hire an expensive attorney to get the case dropped. Total cost me over 10k dollars with medical and legal fees from hiring an attorney and paying the hospital they took me too 3 thousand dollars for the dr simply asking me what was wrong with my shoulder to see if I was good for booking. All because these two baldheaded white cops thought a brown man with pain pills in an arm sling was just pulling a ruse to sell pills.\n\n3 days was hell for me and I can't imagine how those years must have felt. This shouldn't be allowed to happen.\n",

If I had the money I would do it just for the principle of the matter, but they know a person of my class wouldn't be able to afford to do so which is probably why people like myself are targeted; less chance we could legally fight back. \n\nEdit: to all you guys saying you would fund a lawsuit against the police department that did this to me, thank you so much, it warms my heart to see you would do such a thing. At the moment I have seen neighbors and family who tried to fight back get harassed after the fact by the police departments around here. But if I ever move out of this area away from their reach, I promise I will pursue these guys to the fullest extent for their actions against me. For the moment living in my area(by compton) and going after the police legally doesn't end up well when I've seen others try to do so. ",

Charged with three felonies, paid $15,000 in various fees, mainly attorney fees, and the DA ended up dropping all the charges within just a few weeks.  I wanted to sue, but you have to prove intentional malice or any LEO/DA is shielded from liability.  It's an insanely high bar that effectively gives them a blank check to fuck you as hard as they want with zero repercussions.  There ought to be some sort of fund for anyone who is arrested and has charges dropped or beats them at trial.",

I was arrested by a cop over possession of marijuana back when I was 18 (about ten years ago), and in his police report he lied and included that I admitted to the marijuana being mine, which I never did. The pot belonged to a person in the group to which I was with at the time, and he obviously never spoke up, instead just let me take the fall for him. I was only in jail overnight as I was bailed out the next day, but it cost me over $3000 in legal fees to fight the case and get the charges dropped. Additionally, the main reason the DA decided to drop the case was because the lawyer I hired used to work at the DA office and was on good terms with many of his former peers, and about six months prior to my arrest I had testified as a witness in an assault case that put a man away for about 8 years (he and some of his friends attacked a friend of mine with bats and almost killed him). From what he told me, it was because of this that they decided to drop the charges, as a sort of favor for helping them get that conviction, since it was my testimony that really sealed the deal on that case. \n\nI had never been in legal trouble before, and had just turned 18 a couple of months prior so now I have this arrest on my record. Thankfully, I was able to afford representation at the time or my life, and this story I'm telling all of you might have gone very differently. All because a cop decided that trying to guarantee that his arrest would stick was more important than justice and his duty as a public servant. It is for this reason I NEVER give any LEO the benefit of the doubt when it comes to my freedom. All it takes is for one of them to believe that your are guilty before you are ever given a chance to prove your innocence and they can ruin your life. \n\nI'm on mobile so I apologize for the shit format. The troubles I faced pale in comparison to what OP, and so many other innocents are forced to endure in the land of the free. Also, financial strain aside, I'm really glad that you were also able to secure your innocence and I'm especially glad that OP is now able to enjoy his long deserved freedom. The justice system in this country is failing its citizens in a major way, on a daily basis and it is a disgrace. Apologies for the rant, I just haven't spoken about this in quite some time and your story reminded me of how frustrated and disappointed this made me with my country. ",

The state bet on two things:\n\n- Nobody would care to help him\n\n- Another case \"solved\" which in the public eye is often as good as solved.\n\nThat's a bet that mostly works out.

What I heard the most (from nearly everyone) was not what I expected: \"You should never tell the truth,\" to them that was the bigger mistake. No one really cared about what I did or who I was. Even the prosecutor said I was the nicest person they ever prosecuted. Really...I asked why I was there then, they shrugged and said that's just how it works. \n\nAfter $12,000 in legal fees, losing my job and being slapped with a B Misdemeanor - I am more upset that telling the truth was my error. \n\nTheir reaction to my honesty was; \"ha, gotcha sucker! Was a real psychological blow I am still recovering from. Feeling that a lifetime of trying to be a good person meant nothing, rejected by society, and treated like scum. \n\nNow I don't think \"innocent\" or \"people\" are part of the process anymore. \n\n",

This is really only tangentially related to cell phones but I see this as an extension of the \"no good deed goes unpunished\" mindset where people might be wary of extending personal responsibility for fear of being fined or arrested. \nEx: in HS, someone threaten to \"kick the head in\" of someone who had returned to school just weeks ago from having a brain tumor surgically removed. After I confronted this person and pushed them back after they pushed me, I was suspended for 3 days for \"fighting.\" That has a lot to do with public schools in general but I think it's also a reflection of our hyper-cautious culture now.

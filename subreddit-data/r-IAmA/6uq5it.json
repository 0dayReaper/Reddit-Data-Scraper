If you could go back, would you do it again?\n5. What do you think of the fame/publicity that this heist has attracted?",

Therefore by dividing 907815 by 100 then multiplying by 20 and multiplying by 546 we get 62,595,765 calories for 20 tons of Nutella. The recommended daily intake of a person is 2000 calories (varies a lot by person but for the sake of this we'll use 2000). If the guy who stole the 20 tons ate all of it in a week and only Nutella and nothing else, he would in theory have burned 14,000 calories out of the 62,595,765 which would leave him with a true gain of 62,581,765 calories.\n\nAs one pound of weight is gained for every 3500 calories, dividing 62,595,765 calories by 3500 would tell us the man who stole this gained 17,880.5 pounds in weight, therefore he would indeed in theory be much much much much more larger than the rest.",

Where I live, there is a stand about every mile of farmers selling their sweet corn. Usually out of the back of a truck or van and they sell a lot. In fact, people seem to prefer buying corn on the side of the road than at the grocery store.\n\nI'm guessing stolen produce gets moved in a similar way. They take it to a farmer's market or set up a roadside stand, call it locally grown organic corn, sell it for cheap and it'll fly off the shelves. Not to mention you'll blend in because there are countless guys in town also selling corn.",

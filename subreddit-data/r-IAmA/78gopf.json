In the very initial stages of the audition process we are looking to get a sense of who you are, if you are able to connect and tell a story non-verbally without adding the many layers we are all so used to adding on a daily basis as people. So we are really trying to strip layers away rather than add layers. As we move through the process we are also looking for your ability to play, to work collaboratively, to take direction and take risks. Most of our Blue Men have extensive acting experience. ",

They were still in character. When I got my chance to go up and talk to one of the blue men, we took a picture and I said to him that I was really inspired by the show, and that I had done performance art, and I hope one day I can be as cool as you. He looked at me like I was an alien talking for the whole time, but then right before I left, the guy broke character (his eyes got normal and not hugely big) and whispered \"good luck\" to me. I will never forget that. ",

I imagine the really long swoopy whippy poles might break every once in a while. \n\nWho -does- make them?\n\nHow long does it take a new Blue Man to get trained in on the different instruments and songs?\n\nHas there/will there ever be a Blue Woman?\n\nDoes each group have someone really good at catching marshmallows in their mouth?\n\nHas being in the BMG helped you in dating or other social interactions? Do people respond to it favorably?\n\nIs there an aspect of the show which has helped you develop an odd skill which is useful in everyday life?",

I think you are right and that audiences in general are interacting with live shows differently today than they were ten or twenty years ago. But when you sit down in the audience at Blue Man Group and lights come up and the Blue Men look at you, and change their story based on what they get from you and other audience members, it's emotionally dangerous, isn't it?  I think this actually touches on the essence of why people are so drawn to the show.  And I think that we need this! Even more now that we are all so used to communicating through our devices, we need these real, uncomfortable, exhilarating connections. We talk about this a lot in the audition process...trying to find a way to be fueled by the discomfort of honestly connecting with another person, often a \"stranger\". ",

Proper, or rather healthy, immune function is necessary for lots of other things to work.\n\nTl;Dr of the tl;dr- there is an immune system component in basically every disease.",

I would actually disagree with OP because early talk about herd immunity was based on the assumption that infection or vaccination would lead to *sterilizing immunity*. Many infections cause sterilizing immunity, which means you can't be infected more than once. That turned out not to be the case for Covid-19.\n\nMass vaccination is still vital because subsequent infections after a first infection or vaccination are generally more mild, which puts less strain on the healthcare system. This means the survival rate is much higher even for severe cases because they can access good healthcare.\n\nIn theory mild and asymptomatic cases are also less transmissible due to less coughing and lower viral loads, which means the virus spreads less to other people. This would be an example of partial herd immunity. However, the real-world impact of this is a bit unclear because people with mild symptoms are much more likely to go to work or school and interact with lots of people, while people with severe symptoms would stay at home in bed.\n\nI guess it's true that herd immunity worked for the initial strain, but that's not what anybody was talking about when they mentioned herd immunity at the beginning of the pandemic.",

It was always a worry with a coronavirus that it would be challenging to develop long term immunity- some common colds are rtpes of coronavirus.\n\nHowever herd immunity is still important. Although it was hoped the vaccines would prevent further re-infection, they have not and instead reduce severity, likelihood of long covid and death. They do also reduce the level of transmission.\n\nCurrent research is trying to develop long term vaccines that will prevent disease completely",

The consequences of virus infection are quite similar because they share similarities in how the divide and the cells they infect. Also, immunity to viruses is similar across different types. In high numbers, most viruses cause significant disease and death.  Thus there may be similarities to feline coronavirus, but most cats are assymptomatic.

A recent systemic study  looked at all Clinical studies from 1 January 2021 to 1 October 2022 of immunocompromised patients, particularly those with blood cancer, who received tixagevimab/cilgavimab (aka Evusheld). 18 studies, with 25\u2009345 immunocompromised participants were assessed. The overall clinical effectiveness of tixagevimab/cilgavimab against COVID-19 breakthrough infection, hospitalisation, intensive care admission and COVID-19-specific mortality was 40.54%, 66.19%, 82.13% and 92.39%, respectively. Tixagevimab/cilgavimab DID work at reducing COVID-19 infection &amp; severe outcomes for immunosuppressed individuals, including patients with a haematological malignancy. We still need more 3rd generation drugs but it does look like combinations can help.",

We don't know exactly how the placebo effect works, but it is believed that involves the nervous system and the production of some proteins called neurotransmitters. What we do know is that some immune cells  sense and are modulated by these neurotransmitters. So, in theory the placebo effect could modulate the immune system via the stimulation of neurotransmitters. However, this is still a matter of debate. Specially, because this is a very difficult area of research, as the right controls are very difficult to implement.

The home tests pick up highly conserved parts of the virus which means they deal well with variants which may have for example altered spike (the bit of the virus that it uses to get into your cells) \n\nThere have been a lot of variants of Omicron with varying levels of severity. the way you respond to the virus depends- for example if you were originally infected with the original COVID strain (ancestral) it means your immune response is \"imprinted\" and this can mean you feel more grotty when you get the infection. If you had been vaccinated and never had the infection prior to covid that can make you do better. But equally everyone's immune system is impacted by eg how old they are, if they have comorbidities such as diabetes that can make their immune system less effective and the symptoms worse.\n\nThe symptoms are also quite diverse and we learned a lot about those from the Zoe app for example. Loss of smell is still sadly quite common.",

The vaccine does not give you immunity there. Hence why masks were so important. Still should be.",

At the start of the pandemic our immune system had never encountered the virus and so in everyone it had the potential to cause severe disease.  Until we had a vaccine, the best way to slow its spread was to break the human chain i.e isolate from one another.  Now most of us have immunity, through vaccination and/or natural infection and so the severity of symptoms is less and it is likely anyone you pass it to will react the same.  Be assured that hospitalisation rates are being monitored. If anything drastically changes then new rules will be applied.  However, at present most seem to have some form of protection",

The best way to not get long covid is to be vaccinated.  Vaccination doesnt stop infection, but it reduces the length of time the virus is in your body.  Treatment of long covid depends on your precise symptoms.  THere is some evidence that using anti-virals in the initial infection can reduce development of long covid",

Scientists spend huge amounts of time watching how the genetic material drifts from one strain to another.  They then predict what the next train might look like and make a vaccine.

Please can you explain to them why that isn't the case, and also explain what immunology is in layman's terms? I really don't want them to get ill. Thank you all so much.\n\nEdit: @downvotes: I am in no way an anti vaxxer. In fact, I think immunisation and knowledge is very important. I just want to prove to someone close to me that vaccines are indeed safe, and you don't get an opportunity like this everyday.",

Safety of the vaccines is still closely monitored by governments and the companies producing them, and after millions people having been vaccinated they are still considered very safe! Here you will find all the info you need about the COVID vaccines all in layman's terms: [https://www.immunology.org/sites/default/files/2023-03/BSI\\_GuidetoCOVIDvaccinations\\_Mar23-v2.pdf](https://www.immunology.org/sites/default/files/2023-03/BSI_GuidetoCOVIDvaccinations_Mar23-v2.pdf)  \nThe immune system protects us from all kinds of infections through specialized cells and proteins. Immunology is the science that studies how the immune system works.",

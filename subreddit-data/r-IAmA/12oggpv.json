    "postText": "PROOF 1: https://imgur.com/a/rWMIx1c\n\nPROOF 2: https://imgur.com/a/3IMCe7O\n\nHi! I'm Skrintch. Ukr\u0430inian \u0430rtist who p\u0430int col\u043eurful p\u0435t p\u043ertraits. Me and my 2y.o. daughter l\u043est our home near Ky\u0456v when the w\u0430r was started. We didn't have a c\u0430r and were forc\u0435d to walk. Three weeks we hid in b\u043emb shelt\u0435rs because the Russ\u0456an tr\u043eops were advin\u0441ing. I told about it in the Internet and caring people helped us find a person who will take us out by his car. Now we have temporary housing in another town. We p\u0430int and send col\u043eurful pet p\u043ertraits to people who help Ukr\u0430ini\u0430ns from around the world. There is no w\u043erk here but some c\u043emmissions help us buy food and p\u0430y for rent. We p\u0430int for d\u043enati\u043ens dogs, cats, rabbits, horses\u2026 we p\u0430int all anim\u0430ls! Sometimes we p\u0430int people too but not often. \u0410rt makes her happy and distracts from the constant howl of an \u0430ir \u0430larm sir\u0435n when misil\u0435s and k\u0430mikaze dr\u043enes fly over us. Thanks to the help of other countries, they are replenished much less than before. My daughter thinks we are just walking for a long time and keeps asking when we will be back home because she doesn't understand that we have nowher\u0435 else to r\u0435turn. I hope the n\u0435ws is true and we can r\u0435turn to n\u043ermal lif\u0435 soon.

The exact date and location was never known for sure, but it seemed likely Ukraine was going to push the south and cut Russia's land bridge to Crimea (leaving the only way there either 1 bridge or by sea), greatly compromising Russian supply lines. \n\nCrimea was annexed by Russia in 2014, and was one of Putin's proudest accomplishments in office. The threat of Ukraine pushing up to and taking Crimea back may force Putin to negotiate. If he doesn't, Ukraine may attempt to retake Crimea. If the Ukrainians succeed, it's very possible that Putin would be ejected from power, which may be followed by the collapse of the current Russian regime, or in a worst case scenario for Russia, it may break up in to several smaller regions/countries. This is more likely than a lot of people probably realize.",

It's not much but it feels good to get something you love in exchange for something Ukraine needs (money flowing into the economy from outside). I'm pretty sure I've seen one of the channels I watch also cover your content! IDK maybe Denys Davydov or Jake Broe? Not sure on that one, they release videos almost every day it seems like so it all kinda blurs together at this point. Anyway regardless, your artwork is wonderful, and I sincerely hope you guys come out of this conflict stronger than ever (and the same goes for all of Ukraine). I don't have any questions, other than to ask if there is anything you guys need more of where you're currently staying, and where you recommend we send such donations.

Old soviet tubes are great, and Ukraine was known for making some of the best technology products in the union, so I try to buy them whenever I can. Just looking at them in detail, you can tell Ukrainians put better quality parts into their tubes as well. I have some Russian made 6N23P-EV tubes where the internal copper is dusky and oxidized, like it was sitting out for a long time before being used, without polishing first. All my Ukrainian tubes have new shiny copper wiring by comparison.",

All scenarios where Russia exists as it is \u2260 victory for Ukraine, the longest border (all east and north) is with Russia, there will be no trade with them, and all the cities there would be dead, demographics were bad even before the war, and now get worse as the war goes by, so the economic, business are leaving, so as people and even more are preparing to leave,so as people. \n\n0 sings the war will end any time soon, the more it goes, the worse our future will be",

After the war, Ukraine will hopefully be a member of NATO, for example. \n\nI had a premature baby once, 14 weeks early. I don\u2019t want to compare the experience to war, but it\u2019s similar in this way: I knew the outcome would probably eventually be good, but I didn\u2019t know what that would look like. So many babies born so early have ongoing health issues, and it felt like repeating the same miserable day over and over with an uncertain end point while he was in hospital, life was paused and everything that mattered was dependent on this going well. \n\nSo I celebrated every little bit of progress like it was getting promotion at work or winning money. When he finally weighed 1kg, I cried with happiness. Each weight gain, every time his feed was increased, holding him was like the first time every time. \n\nI don\u2019t want to patronise you, but there are so many stories worth celebrating. Every inch of ground that Russia is pushed back, every victory day that gets cancelled, every day Putin hides in his bunker scared of being assassinated by his own men. \n\nIt is awful right now, I apologise from the bottom of my heart if I have offended you with any of my comments. But the world is watching, and the world will not let Ukraine fail - either before the war or after it. We are all with you.",

Actually thank you for attempt to change my mind, I like when people prove I'm wrong and I shift my expectations, but it's not that case.  The best I can do is to have no expectations, because there's a lot of unpredictable factors. It's just that I tend to oversee more negative markers then positive ones. I'd say progress of UAF and western help is the only positive, everything else, like social sentiments and inner political actions are disturbing, if not terrifying.\n\nAnd time, as times goes on, those positive phenomenons tend to loose their value, I mean the cost may be too much, like absolute victory may be worse than some sort of compromise (with security guarantees from west) in the long run\n\nI may sound like a broken record, sorry. It's like I'm trying to explain something and don't know if all those things even make sense outside of my had, hah. \n\n\nP.S. it's just hard to stick to your plans when you're going from hopelessness to obscurity. If you believe in positive outcome - stay and wait. In negative - get out of here at all cost. Everything else -????\n\nP.S.S. It's a nice comparison you made, a lot of common in terms of human emotions, and it's your experience so it's extremely relevant. Any tragedy is a tragedy, some are just bigger and built of millions of smaller ones. Good that it ended well, can't imagine what a stress for mother is to lose a child.",

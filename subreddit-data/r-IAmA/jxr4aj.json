    "postText": "I'm Ricky Kidd. In 1997, I was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for double homicide \u2014 a crime I didn\u2019t commit. I couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer, and the public defender I was assigned didn\u2019t have time or the resources to prove my innocence. I spent 23 years behind bars trying to prove the things my public defender should have found in the first place. In August of 2019, a judge ruled that I was innocent and released me. After I got out, I started \"I Am Resilience,\" an organization that raises awareness about those who have been wrongly convicted. Last month, I got married and, in December, we're expecting a baby daughter.\n \nAnd I\u2019m Sean O\u2019Brien, a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. With the help of UMKC clinical students and my co-counsel, Cindy Dodge,  I represented Ricky for more than a decade and eventually got him released last year. I\u2019ve spent decades working to overturn wrongful convictions, especially for inmates on death row. Before that I was the chief public defender in Kansas City, Missouri, from 1985 through 1989.\n \nRicky\u2019s story and how it illustrates the greater crisis in America\u2019s public defender systems was the subject of a PBS NewsHour podcast called [\u201cBroken Justice,\u201d](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts/broken-justice) released last year. In October, about a year after Ricky was released, producer Frank Carlson checked in with him [for a special episode](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/podcasts/broken-justice/an-update-from-ricky-kidd). Subscribe, download and leave a comment wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/w8txwatoi1061.png\n\n------\n\nEdit: \n\nRicky: I\u2019m happy that we had this time! It is always fun to be with the PBS NewsHour team, along with the one individual who first believed in me, who ultimately never left my side until I came home. A fun and exciting year it has been and looking forward to the next chapter with I Am Resilience/new baby/marriage/purposed living. Feel free to listen to \"Broken Justice\" if you haven\u2019t had a chance, and if you would like to support and participate in the next chapter forward for me, feel free to follow this link and share as much as possible: https://linktr.ee/IAR\n\nSean: In closing: Until we reform indigent defense systems, this story will play out over and over again. There are lots of ways to get involved, and lots of good people trying to change the system. Find out who is doing the work in your community, and support them. Sister Helen Prejean says if all you can do is bake a pie, bake a pie and bring it to a meeting! I'm happy to say Ricky's team was kept well-fed by people who care.",

Ricky had what should have been an airtight alibi for the crime: he was at the Jackson County Sheriff\u2019s Lake Jacomo Office at the time of the murders, filling out an application for a gun permit.\n\nhttps://themip.org/clients/ricky-kidd/\n\nIt could have easily been somebody that really didn\u2019t like him and decided to say he was one of the killers. Just crazy to think that I could be doing my thing and then before I know it, I\u2019m serving a life sentence and have no fucking clue what is going on.",

I hadn\u2019t had a *single* drink that night. Well, I got pulled over for going 7 over the speed limit. My bad on that one, I\u2019ll pay the ticket, I thought to myself. \n\nThe cop, who turned out to be the head of the DUI Taskforce, however, told me I was acting nervous - I was because I have bad anxiety - and asked me to step out and do a sobriety test. I passed everything with flying colors, the walking test, light test, ABCs, etc. and I guess as a last resort the cop asked me to do a breathalyzer. I was fed up at this point, exhausted, nervous and not thinking straight so I just said \u201cnah, I\u2019m good, can I go please?\u201d To which he responded, \u201cput your hands behind your back\u201d and read me my Miranda Rights. \n\nI spent a night in jail until my mom bailed me out the next day. When I went to court, they watched my arrest video and saw that I was polite and passed all the tests, so they ever-so-kindly dropped the charge to reckless driving. **Which** (in GA) **is just like a fucking DUI** but without the permanent record. I ended up spending years trying to pay off the $14,000ish that I accrued between lawyer fees, probation, and reckless driving class, and had to do community service for a year (which I had to take time off for!!!). \n\nI was a broke line cook with shit pay, and that whole thing set me back for a LONG fucking time. I was supposed to go back to college that year but ended up staying in the restaurant, giving my paycheck away every couple weeks, and ironically developed a heavy drinking habit that followed me until I finally quit about 7 years later.\n\nFuck those assholes. I\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t get locked up like OP, though. I really feel for the wrongfully convicted.. hope the system changes for the better one day.\n\nTLDR; broke line cook, pulled over by cop, nervous but sober, got charged DUI (dropped to reckless driving), set back for years with $14k-ish in fees and probation, ironically developed heavy drinking habit after that",

I don't have any kids of my own, but I don't plan on punishing my kids for saying naughty words. On the other hand, I once told my Dad to \"fuck off\" when I was a teenager and he asked me to \"please never do that again.\" I could tell that I really hurt his feelings and so I never did that again.",

She teased me endlessly from ages 5-6 about my crush on her brother. Also told everyone I still watched Barney with no proff. Ruined both Barney and that crush. Her brother was a sweet kid idk what her major malfunction was. But she was sent to school in a brand new adorable outfit, and when we went to the bathroom someone ran through a very small puddle and splashed her ankle with three tiny dots of water. You would have thought she was dunked in water with the fit she threw. She blamed me, I had an airtight alibi dry hands, only soap on them, and hadn't even turned the water on. I explained to her what happened. She threw a tantrum ran out to tell the teacher who made me apologize to this brat. Teacher refused to even let me speak. I wasn't allowed to defend myself and felt helpless. I cried all the way to lunch with my classmates asking why I was crying I covered my face with the bottom of my shirt, classic kid move, and said \"cause I didn't do anything!\" The teacher informed me to stop crying or I would be in more trouble. \nThat was 15 years ago and it still gets me. \nWhen I became I substitute teacher I made sure no child in my class ever felt as helpless as I did that day. I made sure both parties were heard and listened to all witnesses. \n\nI can't imagine how you felt not being able to properly defend yourself even with an alibi. Glad your out and have made a good life for yourself. Congratulations on your new baby!",

And in the ones that do when prosecutors are worried that they're dealing with a wrongful conviction and that there's a chance they could lose a follow up case they put what's called an alford plea + time served on the table, which is basically saying to the court \"I'm telling you I didn't do this but I understand that if I took it to trial there's a real chance I could lose\" and it's handled as a conviction. Which automatically bars you from compensation because you've taken a plea deal. And a lot of times people go for it because they otherwise risk spending the rest of their life in prison if they fail, it's the scummiest of moves to do instead of just dropping the case",

(It statrted out in juvenile court, and all the judge needed to do was find probable cause to have the case sent to adult court, which she did, but she felt there would be significant issues with proving the case BRD, so she set a bond the family could pay.)\n\nThe prosecutors proceeded to request a bond modification, but specifically waited until the following week to do it so they would have a better judge draw. That mistake, once they discovered at trial that their sole piece of evidence against my client was a result of a miscommunication between two crime lab employees, ended up costing the kid 19 months of his life and the county a million dollars.",

It requires money, time, private investigators.....the prosecutor has access to hundreds of police officers, the defense does not.\n\nI'm not sure how to fix this, besides more money. Could we trust an section of police that are also investigating a crime based off the idea they person is innocent, instead of the opposite? Idk if I would, but in a perfect world we deserve it.",

A detective should be just as motivated to prove a suspect innocent as he is to prove guilt. Unfortunately, high conviction rates give the \"law and order\" crowd false justice boners, and increase the chances of sheriff re-election, and budget increases, so that has become their only focus. They no longer serve and protect the public, they serve them selves, and their masters.\n\nNeither public defenders, or private attorneys should need private investigators, or labs or anything else. The same labs the prosecution uses should be tax supported to defend those accused of crimes. Just like the DA can submit something for testing, or ask a detective to investigate or question a witness, the defense should be able to do the same. It should be the DA vs. Defense attorney. Everyone else should be unbiased seekers of truth.",

What knowledge, skill, or factor do they have going for them that the public defender does not?\n\nI have heard public defenders are often overloaded and just don't have the time and investigative resources at their disposal, so that is probably one major thing... But is there anything else that makes an expensive lawyer better than a public defender?... Are they smarter? More savvy? More experienced? More brutal in the courtroom? Better \"connections\" (I have heard surprising tales of certain lawyers having closer relationships with judges, and the ways those lawyers can influence the way a judge presides over the trials. It seems totally wrong and unethical, but I have heard this from more than 1 source that I have deemed to be credible )\n\nEdit: thx everyone for the great answers! I don't have time to respond to all of them, but thx",

Especially on a personal level, were there still people from your life who still thought you were guilty, and what complications came with dealing with that? are they going to reopen the case of the two murdered people?   \n\n\nThank you for taking the time",

I thought I would but it didn\u2019t happen. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ll reopen the case. It\u2019s been almost 25 years and probably would be difficult to pursue charges.\n\nSean: When you convict an innocent person the evidence gets distorted. By prosecuting an innocent person, it distorts the evidence that makes it difficult to pursue the real killer.",

A conviction, no matter how it's obtained, is treated like it's truth. So if you're going to overturn it, and you've already lost your appeal, and you've already been denied your appeal of your appeal, then the law takes away a lot of your options. You can't just knock on a judge's door and say, \"Hey, I've got new evidence, can you look at this dude?\" You have to show that the evidence you got is evidence you couldn't have gotten before, or was withheld from you.\n\nNot familiar with OP's case, but I'm guessing that's what's involved.",

In the 1980s, I was in charge of the office that later defended Ricky, and it made me sad to see how far down the standard of performance had sunk, so I felt a responsibility to Ricky. Something needed to be done, and nobody else was stepping up to the plate.",

Everybody wants to pick up right where they left off, and so many years have passed that that is virtually impossible to do. And so I have clients who look back and all they can see is what they lost. And I have clients who look forward and marvel at the everyday life around them, the beautiful things in their future. And I don't know how to help someone be someone who looks forward. That\u2019s the hardest part. It\u2019s been a beautiful thing to watch Ricky hit the ground running, but I have other clients who struggle every day. \n\nThere\u2019s also a difference in exonerees based on their experience inside prison, and the people who have the hardest time adjusting are those who were on death row. I have one who came within minutes of execution and was exposed to the danger of execution constantly in his last 18 months in prison before we were able to free him, and he is literally disabled by his post-trauma stress disorder. And so that\u2019s hard. Ricky has taken Joe Amrine out to get groceries. I pay for his cell phone so he can at least have that bc he lives on the back porch of his sister\u2019s house, and if it weren\u2019t for the kindness of strangers he\u2019d have a hard, hard time even surviving.",

I would research case laws and stay abreast of new court rulings just in case the legal team may not have laid eyes on it yet. And finally, I would participate in the strategy sessions that were necessary to navigate an innocent person out of prison.\n\nSean: I decide based on the evidence what cases to get into.  I mentioned earlier that there are \"red flags\" that I look for.  For example, there are particular prosecutors who have a reputation for cheating to win, and there are certain defense lawyers who are known for their incompetence.  There are also certain types of evidence that are notoriously unreliable. Eyewitness identification is the least reliable, followed by jailhouse informants, junk science (hair and fiber microscopy, bite mark evidence, etc.), and, believe it or not, confessions. The Reid method of interrogation that is commonly used by police is notorious for producing false confessions.",

I am sure it was discussed in the podcast, but for the purposes of this AMA, it would be helpful to know a little bit more. \n\nI used to work in the superior court system in Seattle, and I knew many of the attorneys who worked in the three public defender agencies. They were extremely dedicated, qualified, and caring of their clients. I hate to hear people disparage public defenders, although I know that it\u2019s often the case in some jurisdictions where private attorneys with little to no criminal experience get assigned PD work on a contract basis.

She was too inexperienced to have a man's life in her hands, but she didn't know enough to know that she didn't know how to do her job, and her caseload was too high to get on top of Ricky's alibi early on. The longer you wait to put an alibi defense together, the weaker it is.  The trial was 13 months after the crime, and two of Ricky's alibi witnesses were contacted for the first time the week before trial. The prosecutor attacked them for being unable to reliably what happened at a particular time or day a year earlier. How can you be sure today it was February 6, and not the 5th or the 7th? The prosecution was essentially alibi proof. This is a good example of systemic incompetence: the turnover is so high, the experience level so low,  that no one is left who knows how to practice law.",

Instead he did it many years later after op was \"proven\" guilty. There's no presumption of innocence after a conviction.",

But I\u2019m also curious as to how you determine who has been wrongly convicted and sentenced as there are some truly terrible people in prison as well. Do you ever worry you may be helping one of these true criminals because they are such good liars? \n\nAlso congrats Ricky!",

Read Malcolm Gladwell's latest book, Talking to Strangers.  I get into cases based on evidence; I look for \"red flags.\"  For example, Ricky's case was brought to me by Dan Grothaus, an investigator I know and trust,  and the prosecutor on the case was known for misconduct, and the defender office was known for being overloaded and ineffective, so it was an easy call.  I don't worry that I'll free a guilty person because it is way harder than it should be to free the innocent ones.",

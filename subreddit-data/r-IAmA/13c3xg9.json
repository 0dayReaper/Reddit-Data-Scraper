I started recording voicework about 8 years ago, but would say I've only really been *decent* for the past 5. \n\nAsk me anything about voiceover processes, or breaking into the industry *without* being a trained actor beforehand, I've got no clue how to go the actor's route. Uphill battle but can be done, and I've got a lot of time for others starting without a theatre background.\n\n**My Proof:** www.voiceofgeorge.com / https://imgur.com/a/IKYUc4Z\n\nedit: proper proof added",

Mostly it's corporate/explainer videos and training work, stuff that blends into the background but is very very consistent. Keeping 'grey' reads engaging and human is probably my niche, if I had one.\n\nDue to the amount of working voiceovers, if you focus on landing adverts you are leaning into the feast and famine side of the industry.\n\nCorporate stuff pays the mortgage, Commercials pay for the fun stuff!",

Everyone is trying to make money off you with coaching so they sell that as the only way.\n\nIn reality even after spending $10k on coaching sessions, you'll need huge amounts of practise with actual jobs. But it's a catch-22 because you won't be good enough to book *proper* jobs. So..\n\nI started on Fiverr, even though it's a dirty word in the business. I was rubbish when I started, but it helped me get experience and feedback, whilst getting paid (a very small amount), which allowed me to upgrade my equipment and improve my recording space without risk. I have done some coaching back in the day, and it helped for sure, but without the constant practise from lowly paid jobs I wouldn't have progressed far.\n\nI've been off Fiverr for ages now, as I've moved up the ladder but it's a necessary part of the ecosystem imo, to keep things accessible to everyone regardless of whether you were privileged enough to have a theatrical education.\n\nBit obsessed with designing themed playing cards the moment, currently working on a Mistborn set. Other than that, Gym and Badminton! Nothing really related to the work at all, ha. Suggest something fun for me to try, I need to mix life up a bit.",

But maybe it can be done with less, using a smart phone and maybe there's a decent mic that's compatible with your phone hardware and software, but audio mixing and editing is complicated enough with the control of a mouse and keyboard, so idk how being limited to a phone could possibly produce a good output without being very unwieldy.",

If you're in an apartment with thin walls and sirens or construction are constantly around you, it's gonna be tough to get this done at home unless your active hours are like 0200-0500. Even then, you'd want to find a budget friendly way to effectively deal with the reverb of the room. I've heard that old egg cartons can work, but I have no idea if that's true or how effective they are. You'd probably also want a pop filter, which I've seen handled with pantyhose around a bent wire hanger.",

That should be enough to see if you can make it work.\n\nAgents.. I have a few, but it's not how it used to be.. i.e in the old days, an agent had a few clients they are actively trying to win work for, it's now more that the agency has a big roster and the clients scroll through it and picks a voice out.\n\nI'd say 95% of my work comes from my direct relationships, which are the golden goose. Really nice people as well, and you don't get that connection working through a 3rd party.\n\nI was making \u00a340,000 a year on Fiverr in the final days, I decided to beat my country's median wage before I went solo. Then made about \u00a312k the first year post-fiverr-account-deletion, working purely directly, and now my last tax return was somewhere about \u00a350k.\n\nMost of these clients are word of mouth, as I really struggle with the sales aspect of the job, I just don't gel at all with the idea of cold calling people and demanding their time.

People turn off or skip commercials in the age of streaming. Instead clients aim to draw you in by appealing to your emotions. A conversational tone is just that, it sounds like you're part of a conversation, just some people talking. When you hear some big radio voice selling you soap you probably register \"that's a commercial, time to tune out\" while if you just overhear someone talking about this great new soap that really helps their psoriasis you are more likely to go \"oh shit I've been having trouble with my psoriasis, what soap is he talking about?\"",

I guess people just downvote when they don\u2019t like what they hear. \n\nAI is absolutely going to decimate voice over work. It will be able to perfectly replicate any type of voice, and clone familiar favourites like Morgan Freeman or Don Lafontaine. It can basically do it now. Tools like [Eleven Labs](https://youtu.be/17_xLsqny9E) are already like 90% perfect for voice cloning, and their text to speech is also like 90% indistinguishable from humans. And they can do a wide variety of ages, accents, languages etc. We are like 1-2 years away from basically not needing humans to do voice over work at all. There may be a few more years before everyone becomes familiar with what\u2019s possible and makes the switch, and some people may still want to use \u201cartisan\u201d human creators the same way some people still buy vinyl records\u2026and things like cartoon characters that are much more unique and specialized may last longer. But I\u2019m sure AI will be able to generate infinite variations of quirky character voices eventually as well. \n\nI would definitely *not* get into voice over work now. It is one field that is certainly threatened by AI very soon.",

Realistically you can earn a living there, but you'll stagnate with the quality of your clients and the feedback you receive. \n\nPushing yourself to make the jump to direct work is terrifying, but really lights a fire under you to treat it like a proper business.\n\nMain advice really is be personable. Everyone working as a Voiceover has a decent voice, so you need to make genuine connections with clients, and that will set you apart.",

Practise practise practise, and be as critical as you can about yourself until you reach the point where you might land a job or two in the market. It's cutthroat and there are many talented people who have much more than 'the VO voice'",

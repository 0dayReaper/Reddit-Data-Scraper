    "postText": "**Our short bio:** We're Chris O'Donnell, Eli Murray, Connie Humburg and Noah Pransky, reporters for the Tampa Bay Times and 10News/WTSP. We've spent just short of a year investigating ['zombie campaigns'](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/): political campaign accounts that are still spending years after the politicians they were working to elect left office.\n\nWe found more than 100 former lawmakers spending campaign donations on things like cell phone bills, fancy dinners and luncheons, computers and an ipad, country club dues, and paying salary to family members \u2013 all after leaving office. Around half of the politicians we identified moved into a lobbying career when they retired allowing them to use those campaign accounts to curry favor for their new clients. Twenty of the campaign accounts were still active more than a decade after the candidate last sought office. Eight of the campaign accounts belonged to congressmen who had died but were still spending donations as if they were still running for office. In total, the zombie campaigns we identified have spent more than $20 million after leaving office.\n\nIt's not just small fish either. We found [Ron Paul paying his daughter $16k+](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=paul,%20ron) over the course of 5 years after he last campaigned in 2012. [He fled when our affiliates tried to ask him questions](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/ron_paul.mp4) outside of the building where he records the Ron Paul Liberty Report. Kentucky Sen. [Jim Bunning paid his daughter almost $95k](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=bunning) since he retired. [Mark Foley](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=foley), who was forced out of office a decade ago amid allegations that he was sexting teenage boys, still spends campaign donations on posh luncheons and travel. Sen. [George LeMieux](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=lemieux) hasn't run for office since 2012, but spent [$41k+ on management consulting services](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?two_year_transaction_period=2016&amp;data_type=processed&amp;committee_id=C00494971&amp;recipient_name=milano&amp;min_date=01%2F01%2F2015&amp;max_date=12%2F31%2F2016) and then [denied to us on camera](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/g_lemieux.mp4) when we confronted him. Hawaiian political operative Dylan Beesley was a campaign advisor the for the late Rep. [Mark Takai](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2018/investigations/zombie-campaigns/spending-millions-after-office/database/#/?search=takai). A couple months after his death, papers filed with the FEC listed Beesley as the campaign treasurer. Over the course of 17 months since Takai's passing, Beesley has paid $100k+ out of the dead congressman's campaign to his own consulting firm for 'consulting services' rendered on the campaign of a dead man.\n\nAnd that's only a slice of what we've uncovered.

Thanks for all the awesome questions, observations and conversations. I also want to give a special thanks to the folks who gilded this post \u2013\u00a0too bad I use an alt when I browse reddit on a daily basis (Ken Bone taught me a thing or two about mixing your private and professional reddit accounts lol). I'll check back in the morning to keep answering questions if there are still some coming in. It would make it easier for me if you make the question a top-level post on the thread so I can get to it by sorting on 'new' \u2013\u00a0otherwise it may fall through the cracks. Thanks!",

If I had to pick one campaign that should attract attention it would be that of Robin Tallon, a former S.C. congressman. He left office in 1993 and is still spending.",

National general presidential elections are kind of a different beast in the sense of how much money they spend and raise, so we didn't think it was fair to compare them to congressional campaigns.\n2. In an attempt to be as fair as possible, we gave campaigns two years to close after they lost an election or retired from office so that they could get their affairs in order, pay off debts, get out of contracts, etc. Hillary's campaign hasn't passed that two year thresh hold to be what we considered a zombie campaign.",

The only exceptions I've ever seen are long-time incumbents who are secure in their victory and prefer to build up a war chest for the long term(and share some with poorer campaigns). \n\nThe thing is, this sort of spending is mostly harmless. Ads don't do much in practice, office space is irrelevant, and most people who work in politics are, frankly, idiots. There's no particular need to limit it, you just need to prevent diversions that line candidates' pockets. After that, the donors' money is being spent on what it was supposed to be spent on, so you let them police it. ",

If it requires a treasurer to handle the money after, wouldn't a small expense be warranted? 16k over five years to a Congressional campaign treasurer just doesn't seem like a big deal even if it's a family member with cancer. Is there some other context you can explain this in? What about other campaigns whose candidates stopped running? Does the treasurer typically get compensated for their work?",

This is the first time hearing about all of this.\n\nWhat was the action, thought or whatever that sparked this investigation in the first place? \n\nHave you ever considered looking into where Jill Stein's campaign funds went? I ask because after she ran for this past election, she garnered a lot of money from people with her whole campaign to put funding towards a recount. To me this felt like a blatant money grab because I don't recall her ever putting forward any sort of framework. Also, to make matters worse, the recount was mostly rejected and there was no follow up or further action. It felt very disingenuous. It's a thread that I would love to see someone follow.\n\nThanks for your hard work!",

I don't want this to turn into another Reddit \"us\" vs. \"them\" thread, but I found this interesting.\n\n1. Is that a fair assessment?\n1. Do you feel that one side or the other spent more this way?\n1. Was there a difference in how this money was spent by party?\n\n**Edit:** Below /u/EliMurray says \n&gt; there are more than 18,000 campaign committees filed with the FEC so we didn't get to look exhaustively at all of them \n\nThis is an important point that invalidates my \"analysis\" above. Counting the number of Ds or Rs on the list isn't worthwhile, because the list isn't exhaustive.",

Reddit even made a great video about it: [https://youtu.be/VfzV00Xz0Kg](https://youtu.be/VfzV00Xz0Kg)\n\nI'm back today with my daughter Gail and grandson Adam ( /r/BenLesser_Grandson ) to answer more questions about my life, the Holocaust, the world today, and how people can live lives that matter. AMA!\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/H1BRmwA](https://imgur.com/a/H1BRmwA)\n\nMore About Me: I am Ben Lesser and I am the founder of the [**Zachor Holocaust Remembrance Foundation**](https://www.zachorfoundation.org/)**.**\n\nI was born in Krakow, Poland, in 1928. With the exception of my older sister Lola and myself, the rest of my family was killed by the Nazis.\n\nOver the 5 years of the war, I was fortunate to survive several ghettos, as well as the notorious camps of Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and finally be liberated in Dachau. After the war, in 1947 I immigrated to the United States where a few years later, in 1950, I met and married my wife Jean.\n\nOver the years, I became a successful realtor in Los Angeles and after retiring in 1995, I have devoted my time to being a volunteer to speak in colleges and schools about the Holocaust.\n\nI wrote a book about my experiences, entitled **Living a Life that Matters** **(**[**paperback**](https://www.zachorfoundation.org/product/living-life-matters-paperback/)**,** [**ebook**](https://www.zachorfoundation.org/product/living-life-matters-ebook/)**)**.  I'm looking forward to talking with you all.",

That's why I have dedicated my life to sharing my story and the stories of other survivors so that people remember that this real and that it happened to real people. \n\nI named my foundation \"Zachor\" which is the Hebrew word for \"remember\" because every generation must re-learn the consequences of hatred and bigotry. We developed a curriculum to help teach this for generations to come. https://zachorlearn.org/",

I'd read Anne Frank's diary and had been studying Germany in WWII for my GCSEs but nothing prepares you for it. \n\nWe saw the train tracks, and visited the barracks that extended long into the distance. They took us to the gas chambers, we could see the scratches on the walls. We saw the piles of hair cut from prisoners, a giant cabinet full of baby shoes. We were all bawling by the end. Getting back onto the bus afterwards everyone was quiet, we didn't really know how to behave. I remember feeling guilty later that day when I was talking and laughing with my friends. \n\nReading the news these days I often think of the sign about those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. It was probably the best thing I never want to do again and I think everyone needs to see it with their own eyes so they understand the reality and the gravity of what happened and what human beings are capable of.",

It was heart rendingly sad and horrific.\n\nWe stood in the gas chamber, icy cold though hot outside, One of the crematoria is still intact with the ovens and equipment in place, to think of the many thousands that stood where I stood, to be gassed and burnt within minutes was just mind shattering, incomprehensible.\n\nMany of the huts have displays of the victims personal effects behind glass walls. One has suitcases, another hair, etc. One contained thousands of pairs of shoes, mostly well worn adult shoes.\n One pair stood out, a pair of bright red ones that look to have belonged to a 6 or 7 year old girl who must have been so proud of them. This broke me, had to go outside to try and compose myself.\n\nCoachloads of people were visiting and walking round, we saw many members of the Israeli armed forces, from junior ranks to army, navy and Air force top brass all in full uniform.\nEvery member of the Israeli armed forces has to visit and I also believe German schoolchildren must visit during their academic career.\n\nPart of me is glad that I went and paid my respects but another part wishes I hadn't, I saw a lot of things I will never forget. \nI will never tolerate any holocaust deniers.",

The USA/World is becoming crazy!!\n\nOddly, my grandmother didn't believe it. We were shocked when we found out and she did come around eventually, I believe after a trip to the Holocaust museum. To clarify, she wasn't going around *actively* telling people it didn't happen, it only came up when she was in her 70s and my mom (her daughter) mentioned something about the Holocaust and her reaction was something like \"Oh, that never happened!\"\n\nI have a theory on what happened in her particular case, based on her life story, but I have no way to confirm. She passed away several years ago now. Her family left Germany in 1939. She would have been a young girl at that time. What I think might have happened is that her parents wanted to shield her from what happened in their home country. She would have been just barely a teen when the war ended and the camps were found by the Allied forces. I can kind of understand a parent wanting to protect their child from knowing about that horror happening, possibly even to old friends and neighbors. And I've definitely seen adults carry naivety on things they were told as children into adulthood.\n\nThis certainly wouldn't be most peoples' reason for not believing it happened. Her situation was fairly unusual.",

Now, I don't know anyone that doesn't believe the holocaust, but it is taught fairly extensively in Ontario schools.  My educational experience was that we spent a lot of time on the Holocaust, including a couple of films and a survivor coming to speak to us.  In Ontario, this happens in grade 10, but because of how the internet has changed, they are considering changing the curriculum to teach kids about it sooner.  Kids are getting exposed to some pretty disturbing misinformation on this subject before learning the truth, so this is probably a good idea.  It's just not like how it was when I was a kid.  \n\nHowever, I know a disturbing amount of people who outright disbelieve or doubt what happened with residential schools.  This was not taught at all in schools when I was a child (I attended school in the 90s and 00s), however it has received a lot of news coverage in recent years.  I learned about the system when I went to university, but only in the context of cultural genocide.  I didn't know about the missing children until the graves were discovered, but apparently Indigenous people who had had children taken from them or who had attended the schools had been saying for years that there were missing children and the government and police refused to search.  And that's pretty common.  There have even been some serial killers in my lifetime who got away with it for a long time because the police just don't care about victims from marginalized groups and won't take reports or investigate properly/at all.\n\nAnyway, I think it is important to teach history so that we can learn from it.  It's the only way we can really move forward and become better as a society.  Otherwise, we're just going to stagnate (or get worse...) and keep making the same mistakes.\n\nEdit:typo",

Many Maya people that I have talked to about the genocide don't even know it happened, because their parents don't talk about it and they don't get taught about it in school, and many non-Maya Guatemalans who have heard about the genocide deny that it even happened.\n\nNevertheless, there are also many Maya and non-Maya people that are very outspoken about their opposition to that presidential candidate, saying \"never again rivers of blood!\" But on the other hand I saw a photo in the news recently about the same candidate, Zury Rios, traveling to a Maya community and being surrounded by Maya people that support her (that obviously haven't learned what the Zury's father has done to their people).

A few years ago I was a part of an interesting program called StoryFile where they recorded me telling my story from multiple directions. Now anyone can \"Ask\" me a question virtually online and you can hear my answer back to you. \n\nIts amazing! You can see more about it here: [**https://exhibit.storyfile.com/?user=Ben%20Lesser**](https://exhibit.storyfile.com/?user=Ben%20Lesser)\n\nI am not the only survivor to have been recorded like this, and there are lots of wonderful programs dedicated to capturing and preserving the stories of survivors like me. Unfortunately its a battle against time so the more stories we can capture and the more students I can speak to while I still can the better.\n\nAt some point this will be out of my hands. It will be up to the next generation to keep the flame alive and keep telling and retelling the stories to prevent the world from developing amnesia. \n\nThis goes beyond stories of the Jewish Holocaust. All people have stories to tell that get lost with each generation. Hopefully between technology like StoryFile and motivated youngsters we can keep it alive.",

In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n&gt;\n&gt;And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying \"Jewish swine,\" collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. \n&gt;\n&gt;The world you live in\u2014your nation, your people\u2014is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. \n&gt;\n&gt;Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. \n&gt;\n&gt;The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\n\n\u2014 *They Thought They Were Free* by Milton Mayer",

Yet we understand that what he did was very wrong, and we act accordingly.\" And she got mad and said \"how dare you compare the two!\"\n\nLike do people seriously think that shitty people just sprout out of nowhere and everyone will recognize them as shitty?

I am German and I am trying to learn about what happened about once a year for a week or two. I want to understand (and I think I do by now) how we as a people could let this happen. \n\u201eBanality of evil\u201c doesn\u2019t begin to cover it. Eichmann (an Hoess, for that matter) are the epitome of German mentality. Square, follow the rules, be precise and punctual, no matter the cost. It was a bureaucracy taken to the insane extreme. \nSometimes it still is. I recently got a letter from our IRS equivalent, informing me that I owe 50 cent back taxes for my motorbike. I\u2019m not paying, just to see if they send a reminder. The time they put in, hell even the paper and postage must be worth more. But them\u2019s the rules. \nBut what happens to all the little, dutiful bureaucrats, when the government makes insane rules?\nYou can go insane watching today\u2019s bureaucracy in Germany. I can\u2019t imagine what it must have been like as a German Jew living in this hellish world. Bureaucrats enforcing a criminal law must have been hell. \nAs stated I am German, but my family wasn\u2019t spared either. My great-granddad was a social democrat and was denounced and was supposed to be deported to Dachau. A friend with influence saved him. I am a social democrat today and have the plaque the US army government gave him in 47, to thank him for his service as mayor of his hometown. Being the only non-nazi there, the US appointed him. Makes me proud to no end. \nBut I still want to know what happened. I still weep for all the Jewish Germans we lost back then. All stories sound read say the same thing. They loved and fought for Germany, even back in WW1. To be betrayed like that because of some delusional idiot\u2026",

But to be perfectly honest I'm not sure I'd trust any of those places to accurately report suicides, if they even know about them all.\n\nWhile yes, food security and needs and such are a big difference between developed and less developed nations... Another big difference is how easy it is to avoid government attention. In a developed nation the government will find out about the death unless you do your own backyard funeral, and even then you'll have to report if you don't want to get slapped for fraud. I would imagine in less developed nations there are plenty of rural places where someone can live and die without having ever really interacted with the government.",

As someone who has struggled with suicidal ideation for 40 years (since age 7), I have never considered my privilege part of the reason for it.  I grew up poor, but had basic needs met; I did not experience the trauma of war or high crime, but was sexually abused and raised by mental illness. I think as a child I just wanted to be away from the patterns and people of abuse.  As an adult, I have found it difficult to escape a fatalist mindset in times of stress. I am atheist, aware of my privilege, and unable often to find meaning in a world where there is so much needless suffering.  \n\nI am suicidal less often now (meds and therapy), but still experience existential crises when the universe gets in the way.  I actively work to find meaning most days.  I'd be interested to know how religion is represented in those results.",

They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.\u201d  \n\u2015 Jean-Paul Sartre",

They were born into a world where it was already too late, Hitler's rise to power occurred before Mr. Lesser was born and the Nazi Party had attained complete control over Germany and begun to conduct forced sterilization by the time he was just 5 years old. His frame of reference begins with some of the very worst things that have ever been done but it does not include the gradual run-up.\n\nAs much as the term *fascism* has become exhausting, we do need to be vigilant. The parallels may not be there for the Holocaust but they absolutely are there for the 1920s. The folks we really need to be asking these questions to are, unfortunately, long gone.",

People are and can be very vulnerable everywhere but part of the alarming nature of political shifts in America recently are even more alarming because we are far more alert to oppression in the US today than Germany or Poland were a century ago. \n\nWe're far from perfect and its not equally distributed but progress is real. \n\nThis is my opinion on the matter and I am not speaking on his behalf.",

I studied antisemitism and the history of nazi germany exessively and I have to say that I'm very grateful for Ben Lesser to do this but also for the many people in here who are alert and vigilant. So thank you and thanks to u/Drabbeynormalblues and u/h3r4ld.\n\nu/BenLesser_Grandson is right when he says \"progress is real\". It's very real and we can't compare today's reality with Nazi Germany. But progress isn't a one way street and late Nazi Germany isn't the bar we mean when we say \"never again\".\n\n\"Never again\" doesn't just mean that we must prevent the holocaust from happening again. It means that we must prevent everything that led to the holocaust from happening again and that includes the situation in Weimar Germany. As the german saying goes: \"Wehret den Anf\u00e4ngen\" (nip things in the bud).\n\nToo many people forgot or simply don't want to remember that conservatives destroyed the republic in Germany and handed its corpse willingly to the nazis. And that's where we have to be vigilant because if we wait for actual nazis to take over it might be too late.\n\nI know it's difficult to convince people about the possible danger of the early signs but that's what we need to do and for that it is moral and necessary to point at the 30s and explain where things might lead to if we allow dehumanization, laws against minorities and fascist rhetorics.\n\nIt has always been difficult to convince people, but it was more difficult back then. Even after the nazis came to power. Two days after Hitler was elected Chancellor Germany's biggest jewish newspaper wrote \"remain calm\" on their front page. In 1936 thousands of jewish tourists from the US and Austria visited Germany for the Olympic Games and, back home, reported that they thought it was nice. That's three years into concentration camps and deprivation of civil rights of jewish citizens.\n\nWhen you listen to german survivors there is a common theme. They all report that their parents said something like \"The country of Goethe and Schiller will never allow it\" when someone expressed concerns - even in the late 30s. My own great-grandmother founded a resistance group in the 30s and told me she had a hard time convincing her own father. In 1935, when he received a letter with his expatriation, he thought they must have made a mistake, took his WWI-Iron Cross and walked to the registration office.\n\nThat's the problem with things that are so unbelievable. Most think it will never happen until it happens.\n\nBut that's why and how we need to point at nazi germany. Not to compare today's situation with it but to point out that things like that can happen again because it happened before.\n\nEdit: thanks for the award!",

I thought about this the whole day and still have no good answer. \n\nThere are some issues that I noticed.\n\nFor example it seems that knowledge about the holocaust [is declining in the US](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/survey-finds-shocking-lack-holocaust-knowledge-among-millennials-gen-z-n1240031) and I think that's something every society needs to be aware when it's supposed to be vigilant against early signs. I've heard someone saying that this has to do with the american education system that is based on property tax which leads to poor neighbourhoods being terribly underfunded. So I'd say that's something that needs to be reformed.\n\nAnd there is a general lack of outrage when it comes to antisemitism. Jordan Peterson for example was able to talk about [cultural marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory) in front of millions without being outcalled for it. Same with Trump. It took the american press on both sides years to point out that a lot of the tropes he uses are antisemitic.\n\nBut I'm not sure why that is and what can be done about it. We had a similar situation in Germany in the 90s. Being antisemitic on TV was a pretty normal thing to do and no reason for public outrage. That changed in the early 2000s when Germany started to properly process its past. The key here was that young germans started to become proud of that very processing and wanted to emancipate themselves from blind patriotism and the old germany in general.\n\nBut that is of course a very special situation and probably no solution for the US.\n\nI think what the US needs first and foremost is a general consensus about the idea that this is a problem and for that you need people who raise their voices when they see antisemitism (or any other kind of chauvinism). I have high hopes that the new National Strategy Against Antisemitim that was released by the White House a couple of days ago is going to help here. It sounds pretty good. But I think it needs more support from the general public and the jewish community.",

When France's revolution took place, many philosophers declared that the perfect state had been created in France. \n\nThose idealisms were then broken over the back of the First World War. \n\nSeeing the failure of the Liberal Democratic state to realize that goal, other schools of thought began to popularize. Communists believed that the goal was still attainable but had to be realized under Marx's theories of historical materialism. Fascists rejected the premise outright: Fascism was born out of the idea that ideals and freedoms were meaningless, and that the only thing that mattered were power dynamics and the exercise of power over those not in your group. It is a lawless, criminal, rudderless ideology that only rose to prominence because the law and order of the powers at the time had catastrophically failed in the eyes of the thinkers of the time. \n\nThis isn't to say that such circumstances couldn't rise again, far from it, we must be diligent to ensure such ruthless ideologies never again rise to prominence. But the political circumstances of the 1920s and 30s were not a time of political stagnation as one could argue it is now, but a time of enormous political upheaval.",

That material is designed specifically for middle school and high school students because we know that this is an age where bad habits and hateful language can fester into lifelong bigotry and bullying. I am also happy to speak with student groups directly or through Zoom sessions.\n\nUltimately, this is a multi-generational problem.

I haven\u2019t read your book yet (just ordered it!), but I have a question about your experiences immediately after the camps were closed. Primo Levi wrote about the awful treatment by Polish civilians and total lack of humanitarian assistance. Was this your experience?\nBe well! \nbagjoe",

His superiors chose him and one other man from his unit to tour the place, because in their words, \"You must be witnesses, nobody will believe a civilized country like Germany is doing this.\"\n\nThe war haunted him his whole life with nightmares, but he did take time to speak to school groups, and give interviews to historians. I only managed to save one copy of his memoir when his estate was liquidated, and it remains a priceless cherished record of his experiences and thoughts.\n\nLike you, he always encouraged others to choose love, and kindness, and to push back against those who would try to divide us. He was also pretty funny and a great musician as well. Thank you for sharing your story.\n\nWhat advice do you have for young people who are nervous about the worldwide rise of violence and distrust aimed at minority groups? What acts of solidarity mattered to you or made the most difference, during and after the war?",

For most of my life. I beg for forgiveness on behalf of any of my grandparents and great-grandparents who were alive back then. Knowing they might not deserve it. I hope the world will be a better place eventually. And I hope it is already a better place than it was when the Holocaust happened.\n\nIt\u2019s our duties as humans to make sure such atrocities can never happen anywhere again. And it\u2019s our duty as Germans to make sure it\u2019s never forgotten.\n\nI am sorry. I am horribly sorry. It wasn\u2019t me, but sometimes it feels it might as well have been.\n\nI thank you for your bravery and I\u2019m happy you got to live a long life despite everything. You lived to tell your story.

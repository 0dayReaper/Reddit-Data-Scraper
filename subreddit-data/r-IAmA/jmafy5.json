I am the originator of the Internet Hate Machine that took the world by storm in 2007-2008. This was confirmed the other day by Gregg Housh.\n\n[https://twitter.com/GreggHoush/status/1322017274623107072](https://twitter.com/GreggHoush/status/1322017274623107072)\n\nI have \"come out of retirement\" in service of dealing with the current QAnon menace warping minds around the world.\n\n[https://twitter.com/Kirtaner/status/1321975553264680960](https://twitter.com/Kirtaner/status/1321975553264680960)\n\nIn the process, I am working closely with forensic researchers and journalists. Most recently, I collaborated with Mother Jones on a piece covering Jim Watkins' past business.\n\n[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/10/jim-watkins-child-pornography-domains/](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/10/jim-watkins-child-pornography-domains/)\n\nAnd lastly, for the piece that revealed my identity to the world, you may read this article published in The Atlantic on August 11 earlier this year.\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/08/hacker-group-anonymous-returns/615058/](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/08/hacker-group-anonymous-returns/615058/)\n\nI am also the founder of 420chan, one of the oldest living imageboards still in operation today.\n\nAsk me Anything.\n\nedit: This is probably going to take a while :)\n\nedit 2: 3 hours in, do not worry, I intend to be here for a very, very long time. I know everyone is going to have so many questions.\n\nedit 3: by \"very long time\" I literally mean days.\n\nedit 4: WE DID IT WE BROUGHT BACK SNACKS [https://twitter.com/MidnightSnacks/status/1323171108481306624](https://twitter.com/MidnightSnacks/status/1323171108481306624)\n\nedit 5: ok i need to take a nap i will return you really have no idea how much your support means\n\nedit 6: morning folks that was one long hard nap\n\nedit 7: in response to the trolls attempting to brigade - [https://twitter.com/Kirtaner/status/1323523066102767622](https://twitter.com/Kirtaner/status/1323523066102767622)\n\nedit 8: to further clarify, there was also some suspicious timing of vote manipulation beginning in this AMA that kicked off the moment I outright said \"Fuck Scientology\" and /u/greggh stated that he was the one that took all the heat. I have a gut feeling there is a coordinated smear attempt right now fuelled by that\n\nOne more for good measure:\n\nFUCK SCIENTOLOGY, FUCK XENU, FUCK L. RON HUBBARD, FUCK DAVID MISCAVIGE, FUCK PETER THIEL, FUCK JEFF BEZOS, FUCK RUPERT MURDOCH, FUCK STEVE BANNON, FUCK ROBERT MERCER, FUCK MARK ZUCKERBERG, FUCK CHARLES KOCH'S ROTTING CORPSE, FUCK DAVID KOCH, FUCK FALUN GONG, FUCK NAZIS, FUCK TRUMP, FUCK THE DISINFORMATION PUMPING GOVERNMENT MACHINES, AND FUCK QANON",

They then used their own people to track the possible subjects at protests and dox them. Following them home, then to their jobs.\n\nAfter a couple months they doxed me and a few others. I was the one they were looking for from YouTube and they created a DVD all about us with our names and info in it. After that they started filing false police reports claiming that I had done things to them.\n\nThe police reports were mostly funny. I was out of town a lot during that time period and half of the things they said I did at their building or to a member, I wasn't even in the state and had simple proof of it. But they filed a police report that I had trespassed on their property and gone into their building and terrorised the receptionist. Some Anons in masks had actually gone into the building. I was not one of them, and I had video proof of me not being one of them.\n\nThat proof didn't seem to matter and I ended up in court where they spent 7 months delaying, missing dates to provide evidence and generally using the court system to make me miss work and attempt to drain my bank account. Joke was on them though, my bank was already empty, I am pretty much always poor as hell. I have no idea how to handle money. So it didn't really hurt as much as they were hoping.\n\nIn the end I took a CWOF, which means I told the judge that I understood that he had seen enough evidence that he had the option to send this to a real jury trial. Even though some of that evidence was literally me not being in the building and instead being blocks away. I accepted the CWOF because they had made a mistake. It only listed their Boston addresses as places I had to avoid, they had buildings in many cities, states, countries, all over! So I went to protests against them in Connecticut, New York, even Los Angeles.\n\nBut it did cost me a lot of work time and stress, so it definitely wasn't a fun time. And with my name out there I ended up all over the press, as everyone from local channels to CNN was playing the Message to Scientology video.",

Glad to hear you like it!!! \n\nFor anyone who is trying to break into security, our free flagship course is [https://www.hoppersroppers.org/course.html](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/course.html). It's the best self-paced intro to computing fundamentals on the internet, bar none. We assume no technical knowledge and help you every step of the way. We also have a course on [security](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/courseSecurity.html), with many more being developed.\n\nIn a twist of irony, one of the primary inspirations for my site was I wanted a healthy, safe place on the internet for people to step into this field. When I was coming up it was Hackforums, Twitter, and anon IRCs, and I knew there was a better way. I'm in the Navy these days but my site is still dedicated to the memories of Aaron Swartz and Bassel Khartabil.\n\nCan't forget my roots, and I'm honored that Roppers will be a place that the next generation will learn the skills they need to change the world.",

Members of the epilepsy forum claimed they had found a thread in which the attack was being planned at 7chan.org, an imageboard that has been described as a stronghold for Anonymous. The thread, like all old threads eventually do on these types of imageboards, has since cycled to deletion.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy_Foundation",

    "postText": "HI, my name is Joe Hall, and I have a rare brittle bone disorder called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) which causes my bones to fracture easily, and be deformed.\n\nOI is typically broken into 8 different types based on commonly found clinical features. I have one of the more severe called Type 3.\n\nI estimate that I have had around 250 broken bones in my lifetime, though I don't really keep count. OI is caused by mutations to collagen molecules in the body. As such it can also effect other aspects of your body such as skin, teeth, hearing, and even your heart.\n\nMost people that have OI experience the majority of their fractures before puberty when the body's bones are still developing.\n\nMy type of OI (Type 3) is considered severe/moderate which is why I have never walked and am around 3 feet tall. I also have low respiratory functions and I am partially deaf. I use an electric wheelchair to get around and hearing aids to hear.\n\nI have always tried to live my life as fully as possible and attack each day like a very hungry honey badger!\n\nThis week is OI awareness week, which is why I wanted to come here and do this AMA!\n\nYou can learn more about OI by asking me questions in the comments, or from the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation &gt;&gt; [http://www.OIF.org/](http://www.oif.org/)\n\nOver the next couple of days I'll try my best to answer as many questions as I can. \n\n**--Verification info for mods and cynics--**\n\nI have done this same type of AMA before here: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/n64z8j/i\\_have\\_had\\_approximately\\_250\\_broken\\_bones\\_so\\_far/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/n64z8j/i_have_had_approximately_250_broken_bones_so_far/)\n\nand here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/90q6yx/i\\_am\\_the\\_real\\_mr\\_glass\\_i\\_have\\_brittle\\_bone/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/90q6yx/i_am_the_real_mr_glass_i_have_brittle_bone/)\n\nand here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/4hhtzg/i\\_have\\_had\\_around\\_250\\_fractures\\_broken\\_bones\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/4hhtzg/i_have_had_around_250_fractures_broken_bones_in/)\n\nHere is a depressing selfie of me on my formally verified twitter account w/the same username used for this post: [https://twitter.com/joehall/status/1357106427660300299](https://twitter.com/joehall/status/1357106427660300299)",

Does this affect you, and if so, are you more sensitive to bright light? \n\nI am curious about this because I am a vision researcher and have worked with people who have differing degrees of a different condition (albinism) that can have this effect, so that the normal reaction to light, the pupil getting small, doesn't help as much because light will still pass through their irises and sometimes their sclera.",

                            "comment": "The \"shifty eyes\" is probably nystagmus, which commonly accompanies ocular (and oculo-cutaneous) albinism. We believe it is the result of \"miswired\" connections from the retinae to the brain: people with albinism tend to have fewer photoreceptors serving the central, most detail-sensitive visual area (called the fovea), and as a result the portions of the brain responsible for vision and eye-movement control have problems properly calibrating, leading to this oscillation. (This is horribly oversimplified, but captures the essence of the problem).\n\nYou can learn more about the condition by visiting [The American Nystagmus Network](https://nystagmus.org/). There are potential treatments (not \"cures\", but treatments) that can help reduce the effects on vision, and help deal with the social problems that some children experience due to being different.\n\nThe first step is to find someone -- either a specifically trained ophthalmologist or optometrist -- or a research lab that specializes in nystagmus. It is a complex condition, and can only be properly categorized by an expert making precise, high-speed (at least 250 samples per second) recordings of the eye movements under a variety of viewing conditions (e.g., across the range of gaze angles; at far and near targets; etc.) using special equipment, and then be evaluated by someone who has the knowledge to properly interpret the results.\n\nOnce the nystagmus is accurately classified, it may be possible to treat it based on certain exploitable properties, essentially what viewing conditions will minimize the oscillation and increase visual acuity. Treatment is usually (but not always) muscle surgery, though it is really one of the simplest and most minor operations performed. It is an outpatient procedure, with results seen within days, and complete healing within a couple of weeks.\n\nI must emphasize, however, that if your child does have underdeveloped foveas, that will be the limiting factor in how much visual improvement will be possible, because if there aren't enough photoreceptors there can be only so much ability to see fine detail. Think of it like an earlier model digital camera compared to a more modern one. But even if the visual improvement is minimal, the social improvement may still be worthwhile.",

I know a lot of folks in the OI community did not like that movie because Price was a villain. But in real life even people with disabilities have the ability to do evil things. Overall I thought it was a good film and brought a lot of good exposure to OI.",

My question is how have you found a comprehensive medical team? Collagen is in everything, and finding a whole team that knows collagen and MTCDs has been really difficult for me. So far I've got a cardiologist who knows about it, but feels like I'm too complex, so I'm waiting for Mayo. Have you had success in finding a comprehensive care team for all the neurological, GI, and rheumatology issues that collagen disorders come with?",

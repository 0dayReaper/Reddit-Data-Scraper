We appreciate your time and for reading! Have a great week! - Molly (social editor)**\n\nPROOF: [https://i.redd.it/tlgnkkvbmzqa1.jpg](https://i.redd.it/tlgnkkvbmzqa1.jpg)\n\nTikTok has faced scrutiny in recent months from state officials to federal lawmakers over the Chinese government\u2019s access to and influence over US users. The popular social media app has faced bans [at every level](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/why-tiktok-app-bans-are-trending-across-the-us-explained)\u2014on college campuses, across most state governments, and within the halls of Congress. But a country-wide ban, which federal lawmakers are now considering, faces some hurdles.\n\nIt\u2019s been interesting to see lawmakers coming to the defense of TikTok after the bipartisan concerns raised at the hearing with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew. Not much is expected to get done in the current divided government, but opposition to TikTok is one of the few issues with enough momentum on both sides that we might see something pass.\n\nAnswering questions today:\n\nSkye is reporter with Bloomberg Law covering consumer privacy and data security. He primarily follows litigation happening in the courts, but also reports on how other branches of government engage with privacy and cybersecurity issues.\n\nEmily is a reporter with Bloomberg Government in Washington, D.C. covering Congress and campaigns and recently [wrote a story](https://about.bgov.com/news/ocasio-cortez-progressives-see-censorship-in-bid-to-ban-tiktok/) about how House progressives are pushing back on efforts to ban TikTok. She is also excited to answer any questions you have generally about Congress.\n\nWhat do you want to know?",

Are either of us correct or is the answer a bit more nuanced than that?",

We should not assume that our government will interpret the bill's language so the bill will have the least impact allowed by the language in the bill.\n\n A good exercise would be to pick a controversial part of the bill and do a thought experiment: **How could you use the bill to destroy the person you dislike the most.** That will be how the bill gets used eventually, though since the bill is already aimed at *enemies of the state*, this bill is already built with hostile intentions. The fact that there are no exceptions for things like a normal person using a VPN mixes with the hostile intent of the bill to equal out to a very bad deal for anyone who likes the thought of freedom.\n\n Louis Rossman read the relevant part of the bill, and as it is currently written, it could be used to go after anyone who supplies technology that allows users to access banned technology, and any user who uses that technology.\n\n\n&gt;That said, some policy analysts have expressed concerns about the broad nature of the language. The real questions about applicability would come up during the regulatory process if this became law, but I'll also caveat that this proposal has many steps to go (as Emily also noted).

Getting more tech-savvy elected officials is a factor of time/the folks electing them.\n\nI don't want to excuse any lawmakers for not asking better questions on this, but precedent does play a role here.

[Source](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/statistics)\n\nThe RESTRICT Act does have some things going for it. It's truly bipartisan, which makes it more likely to pass. There's interest among both House and Senate leadership, which is also key.\n\nBut RESTRICT has a long way to go. It needs to be marked up in a Senate committee, and then needs to pass in the Senate. Will the House take up that bill? Will they try to do their own? If the later, can both chambers reconcile their bills? Are we going to see issues in the House as the GOP has a four-vote margin that has tripped up far less controversial bills?\n\nA lot of bills take time to pass. They get reintroduced again and again and again before they pass (if they ever pass.)\n\nOf the 4,000+ bills that have been introduced since Jan 3, RESTRICT is one of the several dozen I'm keeping an eye on. But it's too soon to say whether it lands on Biden's desk. -Emily",

They also haven't provided any supporting evidence on that front. - Skye",

As long as they're going through legal pathways (what federal agencies do illegally is a whole other conversation, but not one that's really relevant when we're talking about proposed laws), I'm pretty sure the US government needs subpoenas to get your social media data.\n\nFeel free to fact check me on that, but it's probably a good starting point for your question.",

We could do a search for bills ([here's a website that will allow you to do that for the House](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/?index=%22lobbying-disclosures%22&amp;size=10&amp;sort=[{%22_score%22:true},{%22field%22:%22registrant.name%22,%22order%22:%22asc%22}])) but we can't really say how they were lobbying on the bill and what they were asking for.\n\nI do think it's safe to say that because FB and Insta have similar features to TikTok, Meta could benefit if TikTok was banned in the US.  \n\\-Emily",

John Thune's attempt at creating a framework that can uniformly address them now and in the future. You're correct that TikTok and BytDance aren't mentioned once in the bill, but it's been labled as that because it would allow the Commerce Department to effectively ban tech from any \"foreign adversary.\" \n\nThe bill contains more specifics on how foreign adversaries would be identified, but it includes China in a list of existing foreign adversaries. Because TikTok is owned by parent company ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing, China, the app would therefore be subject to the limitations outlined in the RESTRICT Act. \n\nBut to your point, the bill isn't explicitly targeting TikTok and would affect plenty of tech beyond the social media app. - Skye",

The Chinese government is willing and able to exert direct control over Chinese companies and break international laws to further their geopolitical agenda, so having that much access to user data and content feeds of American citizens is seen as a national security risk.\n\nTo give one example of why, without going into detail I work for a company that handles a lot of classified data. I don't personally, but we all have to go through the security trainings. One of the primary ways modern espionage happens is through developing inside sources in companies like mine through social engineering, and the first step in that is identifying employees who are sympathetic to the other country, have a grudge against their employer or the US government, or would be susceptible to blackmail or bribery. The Chinese government having direct access to a vast database of information about the day-to-day lives of American citizens that could be mined for that kind of information, including information people may not be aware they were sharing, is highly concerning in that respect.\n\nNot saying that I support the RESTRICT Act or that I necessarily think what American companies are doing with that same information is less dangerous, but that's the rationale for singling out TikTok.",

Lack of understanding internet protocols and how social media itself works. Waste of money, time, and energy. Not the first proposed act to be out of touch with reality. I don't think it will pass. In a way, it's just as uninformed as net neutrality proposal. Preventing access to TikTok in the US is only going to encourage sales of VPN and do very little effect (besides kill a major amount of active users) against usage. Like pirating, I don't see the US enforcing it either unless it's a massive scale.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Provides a harmful scale of fear, propaganda, paranoia, and misinformation. If a lot of people aren't well educated on the internet and sees something on the internet (let alone information about how the internet works) that scares them, once it gains a lot of attention, how much of the concern is legitimate concerns, versus something sensationalized and false? Privacy within itself should be a concern to everyone. But the action of singling out TikTok is not targeting the actual problem. \n\n\n\n\u2022 I believe internet safety is a major concern. I believe in privacy being a concern. Social media scares are nothing new and people forget about them until another pops up. Informing people to be safe online will go a lot farther than banning a controversial social media platform. Implementing regulations will go far too as to what platforms can share and sell or ask for. We pride ourselves on freedom of speech. That is why killing off one or multiple platforms will only grow more.",

I don't have hard numbers on TikTok ban coverage compared to other events in the world, so I can't truly assess the amount of attention the topic is receiving, but anecdotally we're covering this developing issue (among many others) because TikTok is a massive social media platform, with over 150 million monthly users in the US. The complete removal of that app would affect millions of content creators and small businesses on the platform, so that's just one reason we're writing about it. \n\nIt's hard to say for sure why you haven't seen RT cover this without inside knowledge, but I will note that it's a state-owned news outlet. And, given the comparably tense diplomatic relationship between the US and China vs. China and Russia, it's likely that US public officials are talking about this much more attention than anyone in Russia. - Skye",

It was about progressives defending TikTok but I do wonder why no conservatives were canvassed.\n\nAlso, I guess I don't really follow or fear the reason for banning it  ...  would it be to prevent the Chinese from getting more of our information? How much harm would that do us?\n\nAlso, if Republicans are in favor of the ban, is it that they fear the \"popular app\" as you put it might indoctrinate young people more than their side could get its reasoning out?\n\nI enjoy TikTok. I haven't seen too much that is extreme except for the content reported by Libs of TikTok, which I must admit I usually see on other platforms. I guess given all the data collection already going on by business and government, it doesn't seem particularly threatening to me and might actually help all sides get their messages out.",

Even if TikTok hasn\u2019t sent a single piece of data to the Chinese government to date, if they\u2019re asked to do it tomorrow, they will do it.\n\nEven if TikTok hasn\u2019t altered the algorithm yet, if the Chinese government asks them to tomorrow, they will do it.\n\nI don\u2019t really understand what people don\u2019t get about this. Like, even if you\u2019re against the TikTok ban, you kinda have to admit that it is potentially a HUGE Trojan horse tech that could be used in war vs America. And yes Facebook benefits here and yea Google has all our data too, but at least those are American companies.\n\nSpeaking of propaganda it\u2019s crazy how there are basically NO anti-TikTok opinions on Reddit. Very suspicious.",

Such as allowing spying on all of our people through businesses such as Amazon or Google? Or illegally performing insider trading?

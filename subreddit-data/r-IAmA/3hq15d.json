If you\u2019re curious, you can watch the first episode here: https://www.facebook.com/patrickstewart/videos/879535608801013/?video_source=pages_finch_trailer \n\nP.S. I have a helper to assist me typing (I\u2019m old). Ask Away!\n\nPROOF: https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/634372330765033472\n\nUPDATE: It was mind blowing to see all of these questions.

Unbelievable because I never expected it would happen to me and as an ex-athlete and huge fan of the Olympic Games, it was one of the best days of my life. And, I ended the day taking home the torch, but I seem to have mislaid it. If anybody knows where it is, please let the @SirPatStew team know. ",

Under the feudal system peasants were tied to the land they worked and couldn't really leave. Whole generations lived, worked and died in the same places, in the same communities, with the same linguistic influences. Not surprising that every little village ten miles from every other one has a distinct accent. It's like evolution - isolation leds to variation.\n\nWith the US you already had carriages, railways etc when you went out there (or soon after - not so hot on rail history). Your range of movement was much larger from the off, plus you're a young nation. Accent variation at that kind of level hasn't had the time or isolation to develop. Therefore, greater distances between distinct accents.",

It\u2019s often stated that \u201cThe Inner Light\u201d or the \u201cCaymen\u201d episode, is one of your favorites. I was hoping you could briefly describe your feelings about that episode and what about it resonated with you? For the rest of my life, I\u2019ll distinctly remember the scene where you hug the recorder after Riker leaves the room. Thank you for inspiring me, for teaching me so much through Jean-luc. ",

But another important reason is that I had a son in that episode who was played by my son, Daniel Stewart. And if you care to see how he has grown up, watch my new series Blunt Talk. ",

It was poignant, spoke to all the best attributes of Star Trek, upheld Picard as the shining beacon that he is and left a very intelligent debate sort of open ended for the viewer to think about.\n\n\nI really hope Star Trek gets made again for TV, preferably by Netflix! Much of the younger generation now needs exposure to good sci-fi that isn't all time warps and laser blasts.",

I have three questions:\n\n1.\tWhich Captain did you have more fun playing \u2013 Captain Ahab or Captain Picard?\n\n2.\tDue to your fame \u2013 is it hard for you to enjoy most activities that some people take for granted?  For example \u2013 can you and Sir Ian McKellen go down to the pub for a pint of beer without being harassed by fans?\n\n3.\tFinally \u2013 what was going through your mind at [this moment](http://i.imgur.com/14FEj.jpg) during this photo op?\n\nThanks again!\n",

            "comment": "Hi, Sir Patrick! I have eagerly awaited your AMA - thank you for doing it!\n\nFirst, please allow me to say **thank you.** At a young and critical age when I had very few positive male role models in my life, you beautifully rendered in Captain Picard a powerful but temperate man worthy of emulation: externally rational but internally passionate, proud but grounded, diplomatic but resolute, shrewd but decisive. Your work as Picard as an immensely positive presence, and I believe seeing him as an alternative helped me break more fully away from the influence of an angry, embittered, abusive father. As I learned ever more about your childhood experiences and your positions on domestic violence and PTSD, I saw that the good man on-screen was occupied by a good man off-screen. So, at length: **thank you.**\n\nMy question:\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite story about a Next Generation co-star behind-the-scenes that we may not know about?\n\nP.S. You also helped me go bald with grace.\n\nEDIT: Came back from a day of meetings to dozens of great comments - thanks everyone! Can't say I'm not disappointed that Sir Patrick didn't respond, but I got my first gilding, so that's pretty great. Thank you, gilder!\n\nEDIT 2: Just realized I was gilded twice! That's a hell of a first time. Thanks, second gilder!\n\nEDIT 3: Thrice! Thank you! Seems like this comment really struck a nerve.",

Well, it's inspiring.  \n\nYou do not know me, but you have affected me in a profound and good way.  There are many battles I am able to fight in part because of the role model you provided.  ",

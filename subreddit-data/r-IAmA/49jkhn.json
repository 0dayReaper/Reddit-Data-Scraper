But I\u2019m excited to hear what you\u2019re interested in.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nMelinda and I recently published our eighth Annual Letter. This year, we talk about the two superpowers we wish we had (spoiler alert: I picked more energy). Check it out here: http://www.gatesletter.com and let me know what you think.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n \nFor my verification photo I recreated my high school yearbook photo: http://i.imgur.com/j9j4L7E.jpg \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**EDIT:** I\u2019ve got to sign off. Thanks for another great AMA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiFFOOcElLg\n \n&amp;nbsp;",

Polio, Malaria, HIV, TB, etc.. are all diseases we should be able to either eliminate of bring down close to zero. There is amazing science that makes us optimistic this will happen.\n\nThird are tools to help make education better - to help teachers learn how to teach better and to help students learn and understand why they should learn and reinforce their confidence.",

In case of an AI arms race the regulated parties might be disadvantaged even though they might be more likely to produce friendly AI vs an unregulatable rogue state, for example. [J. McGinnis (2010)](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1593851)\n\n2. Slowing down progress in AI research and not the progress in computing technology might make takeoff scenarios faster and less controllable because the AI will be less limited by computational resources.

Sutton on The Future of AI (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD-FWetbvN8)\n\nEdit: Added sources.\n\nEdit 2: User Ken_Obiwan [has commented on ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/49jkhn/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/d0vtvno) that might actually work for government intervention.",

There are a lot of great teachers but we don't do enough to figure out what they do so well and make sure others benefit from that. Most teachers get very little feedback about what they do well and what they need to improve including tools that let them see what the exemplars are doing.\n\nTechnology is starting to improve education. Unfortunately so far it is mostly the motivated students who have benefited from it. I think we will get tools like personalized learning to all students in the next decade. \n\nA lot of the issue is helping kids stay engaged. If they don't feel the material is relevant or they don't have a sense of their own ability they can check out too easily. The technology has not done enough to help with this yet.",

Also, whenever you notice any pattern that crops up from time to time that you *don't* know the probabilities for - take a minute and work it out (even just ballparking it is better than nothing). There are plenty of patterns that are you won't see *every* game, but still pop up often enough that it's worthwhile to figure them out. It'll kill your time for that one game, but it'll help every future game.",

I now work in the STEM field and completed my 4-year degree with no debt and I owe it to your charitable work.\n\nThank you, and thank you for starting the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.",

Also the government needs to talk openly about safeguards. Right now a lot of people don't think the government has the right checks to make sure information is only used in criminal situations. So this case will be viewed as the start of a discussion. I think very few people take the extreme view that the government should be blind to financial and communication data but very few people think giving the government carte blanche without safeguards makes sense. A lot of countries like the UK and France are also going through this debate. For tech companies there needs to be some consistency including how governments work with each other. The sooner we modernize the laws the better.",

This was my essay entry:\n\n&gt;The coolest computer would be one that changes speech into words that I can see because I'm deaf. The computer should be powerful and portable. The microphone could be worn on my body or set on a table. It would have a heads-up display that projects words whenever someone speaks.\n\nI'm curious if you remember this meeting - I'm to your right in this picture: http://www.proudlyserving.com/images/itm1995.jpg\n\nMicrosoft held a similar contest a year later but did not do it again after that. Have you ever given thought to having another contest like this world-wide, perhaps to spur innovation among children to help the goals of your foundation?\n",

There's a program called \"Hunt the Wumpus\" aimed at high school students that teaches program design, problem solving, etc. They also have a high school internship program they offer to students within driving distance of their Redmond campus.\n\nThere's probably more examples, but those are just the ones I'm familiar with that Microsoft is doing now.",

People thought we were a bit crazy - even leaders in the industry like Ken Olsen said they didn't need a computer at home. Being young allowed us to think about computers in a different way.\n\nToday the challenge is to make computers more intelligent. Software still doesn't understand what thing I should pay attention to next - in fact the proliferation of various tools like texting and email and notifications mean the user has a lot of complexity to deal with. Eventually the software will understand what you should pay attention to by knowing the context and learning about your preferences.",

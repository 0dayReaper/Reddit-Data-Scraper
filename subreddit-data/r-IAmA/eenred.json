    "postText": "Hello, I'm Mark Rober.  I have a YouTube channel where I build stuff and come up with new ideas.  I recently cofounded #TeamTrees with Mr. Beast.  My passion is getting people (especially the young folk) stoked about Science and Engineering.  AMA!\n\nPROOF- https://www.dropbox.com/s/1c3coui7rzuhbtc/AMA%20Proof-%20Mark%20Rober.png?dl=0\n\nMy channel- https://www.youtube.com/markrober\n\nMy most popular videos on reddit were probably:\n1) Glitterbomb- https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/a739zk/package_thief_vs_glitter_bomb_trap/\n2) Carnival Scam Science- https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/78k522/carnival_scam_science_and_how_to_win/\n3) Courtesy Car Horn Honk- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv8wqnk_TsA\n\ntl;dr of me: \n\n-I have a Masters in Mechanical Engineering. I worked at NASA for 9 years (7 of which were spent on the Curiosity Rover).  After that I worked for Apple for 4 years doing Product Design in their Special Projects Group (I just quit to do YouTube full time 6 months ago).\n\n-Some highlights for me this year were:\n  + Co-founded TeamTrees with Mr. Beast \n  + Went from 3M to 10M subscribers on YouTube and passed 1B views (I make 1 vid/month)\n  + Announced a show I'm making with Jimmy Kimmel that will air on Discovery where we prank people with cool contraptions that violate social norms\n\n\nEDIT- Ok. After 2 hours I'm gonna sign off for a bit! I will check back later and if there are any questions that have bubbled to the top I will try and address them. That was fun and different for me!! You guys are the best!",

One things for sure, your 2020 december vid has to be going to space! (If you do you going down in history!)",

I lawyered up pretty strong on this one so I feel really confident in my position all across the board.

We didn't try or weren't able to obtain releases from the rest and I don't want to ruin their lives for a single bad decision without their consent.  Also gets more legally tricky unblurred and without a release because you open yourself up to some ambulance chasing type of lawyer who would track them down and encourage them file a lawsuit.",

Sold it to some guys in the UK and they wanted me to come up with more ideas.  It may sound like a downgrade but it was a fun opportunity and a chance to see what it's like starting a business plus I knew I could always go back to NASA if it failed abysmally.   After doing that for 2 years I was offered a position at Apple to do really cool stuff so I took it.  My philosophy on career paths and life really is like crossing a river by jumping on stones.  Have a very rough general idea of your path but then look at the best stone and hop on it.  Only at that point will you really see the next available rocks and then wiggle them all with your foot and pick the best one.  This idea of a having a 20 year career plan or knowing exactly what you want to do with your life in high school is a fallacy and it stresses people out.  We think life paths are a straight line but they are always filled with twists and turns and mountains and valleys.  That's way more interesting anyways :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT- link to that Halloween video- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOQws77j\\_6c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOQws77j_6c)",

                            "comment": "&gt; My philosophy on career paths and life really is like crossing a river by jumping on stones.  Have a very rough general idea of your path but then look at the best stone and hop on it.  Only at that point will you really see the next available rocks and then wiggle them all with your foot and pick the best one.  This idea of a having a 20 year career plan or knowing exactly what you want to do with your life in high school is a fallacy and it stresses people out.  We think life paths are a straight line but they are always filled with twists and turns and mountains and valleys.  That's way more interesting anyways :)\n\nAmazing. Saving this for future reference, thanks.",

That advice stuck with me, and it was easier to follow for some classes than others. After years of doing my best to heed that advice, I was lucky enough to be offered a job working on Mars 2020 at NASA JPL! \nI believe studying for the sake of deep understanding played a strong role in getting this amazing opportunity.\n\nDo you have any advice for engineers about to enter the workforce? Are there common mistakes you see young engineers make that can easily be avoided?\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: Thank you for my first Gold and Silver!",

You'll noticed the lady that stole the package after covering herself up didn't have a reaction.  That's because the weather was slightly colder and the box malfunctioned.  GPS still worked so we found it in the dumpster next to her apartment (we recovered probably 90% of the boxes and they were always in the closest dumpster... fart spray ftw).  At NASA and Apple the problems were much harder but you also have massive teams working on them so one person's job is always doable.",

Like many low molecular weight organosulfur compounds, the smell is potent and can be detected even when highly diluted.[6] In 1889, an attempt to distill the chemical in the German city of Freiburg was followed by cases of vomiting, nausea and unconsciousness in an area with a radius of 0.75 kilometres (0.47 mi) around the laboratory due to the smell.[7] British chemists at the Whitehall Soap Works in Leeds noted in an 1890 report that dilution seemed to make the smell worse and described the smell as \"fearful\".[8] Thioacetone is considered a dangerous chemical due to its extremely foul odor and ability to render people unconscious, induce vomiting, and be detected over long distances.",

I think the psychology of conspiracy theorists is fascinating.  I think generally they are people who weren't the smartest in their class growing up.  This gives them the \"secret knowledge\".  They have a leg up on the sheeple.  Then a community forms and now they have an identity and friends.  There is just no incentive for them to look at it objectively.  Confirmation bias runs strong. If they agree the Earth is round then they lose all their friends and go back to being the not smart ones.  They don't receive a hero's welcome from us either.  We're like \"it's about time idiot\".   It's just misaligned incentives.  If it wasn't flat earth it would be something else.  Don't despair if you feel people are getting stupider they're just getting better at sharing it.",

                    "comment": "I feel strongly about burnout.  I can't speak to your situation but I will speak to mine and hopefully there is some nugget that will translate for you.  I feel like YouTubers feel this pressure that as soon as they see some sort of success they need to scale up.  Hire a team, do merch, write a book, start releasing 4 vids/week, start a podcast, etc.  It's the equivalent of turning up the speed on a treadmill.  At first it's exciting and you're killin it but the problem is that the dopamine wears off (that's a feature not a bug of human evolution to keep us striving for more) but you're stuck on a treadmill at a sprinter's pace.  That to me is the definition of burnout.  It's the same input but you're not getting the same output you used to.  I have done 1vid/month for 9 years.  I JUST hired my first full time employee a few months ago.  I still do all my own editing because I like it!  Why would I outsource that?!  I've just really tried to keep my treadmill at a jogging pace and keep the video quality high and as a result I've never felt burnt out yet.  There's a great story about this concept- [https://bemorewithless.com/the-story-of-the-mexican-fisherman/](https://bemorewithless.com/the-story-of-the-mexican-fisherman/)",

It was such a group effort from so many YouTubers and people who just really latched on to it and it was really special to be part of it and watch it unfold.

In my opinion, the most important thing is to be able to show how passionate you are about space and the space industry! If there's an astronomy club at your school, get involved with it, if you're doing projects in school and you can, make them related to space/the space industry! If you can get involved with NASA or some other company/organization in the space industry via an internship or volunteering or just go to events that they have. Being able to show your engagement with the industry before getting a job in it, especially if it relates to what you want to do, will help show companies that you are passionate about working in the industry.",

I'm currently pursuing my bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering. I've always found a desire within myself to stay inclined to scientific arenas wherever I may decide to go with my career.\nMy question to you is, do you think I can make it into space and research following the stream I'm currently in? It has always been a dream but I'm clueless for the opportunities, or lack of, out there.\nYour reply would mean the world to me.. thanks a lot.",

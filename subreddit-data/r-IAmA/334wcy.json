This is my first time doing a reddit AMA, and I'm looking forward to answering as many of your questions as time permits this morning (with assistance from Victoria from reddit).\n\nThis week we are celebrating a milestone, I'm taping my 500th episode (#ramsay500) for FOX prime time!\n\nAbout me: I'm an award-winning chef and restaurateur with 25 restaurants worldwide (http://www.gordonramsay.com/). Also known for presenting television programs, including Hell's Kitchen, MasterChef, MasterChef Junior, Hotel Hell and Kitchen Nightmares.\n\nAMA!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GordonRamsay/status/589821967982669824\n\n**Update** First of all, I'd like to say thank you.\n\nAnd never trust a fat chef, because they've eaten all the good bits. \n\nAnd I've really enjoyed myself, it's been a fucking blast.

You can have them as a snack at midnight, or at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. ",

It's a guy who is judging you incognito. We have a lot of guys in this country, and Europe, who are a bit too familiar, too chummy with chefs, and they overindulge - food editors, they'll know, and tip off the chef. With a Michelin guide, you have *no* idea when they'll be in, or when they'll review you. And that's why they're the most feared and respected by chefs.\n\nNow I'm always asked - you're a hands-on chef, you're on TV, how come you're still with these stars? Who does the cooking when you're not there? \n\nWhen I'm not there, I have trusted proper chefs - like Clare Smyth, the chef de cuisine in Chelsea - even when I'm there, she's still running the ship. She's been running it there for 10 years.\n\nSo the stars are awarded to the restaurant. And sometimes the chefs think the stars belong to the chefs, but they belong to the restaurant. The service is just as important. Michelin's had a hard time in America, because it was late coming to the table. But if there's one thing I respect, it's consistency. They manage to identify consistently, and it's all there for the customer.\n\nSo when people ask me \"What do you think of Michelin?\" I don't cook for the guide, I cook for *customers.* ",

So they won't know *exactly* what they're doing, but we'll show them basic techniques a few weeks prior. And also, things like the croquembouche - we'll do a class in sheet pastry, but we'll do sheet pastry BUNS, as opposed to actually doing a croquembouche. \n\nWhen it comes to the more serious elimination challenges, they'll have insight 3-4 weeks out. We are halfway through shooting season 5 of Master Chef Junior, and I am staggered by the level of competition. We start taping tomorrow morning, but based on the standards of the first few seasons, the level is just amazing - they are coming in better, stronger. And for kids to have ballet lessons, soccer lessons, that's something we've grown up with. And I've never known kids like we're having now, who are having cooking lessons outside of school hours. ",

There is NOTHING worse than an overcooked brussels sprout. The smell is *disgusting.* ",

I certainly don't sit down and eat dinner.\n\nI have a breakfast with oatmeal, that's the first thing, and that sets me up for the rest of the day.\n\nIt's very hard to sit down for a 3 course meal, and I'm very easy to please. If i go out to dinner, I'll share an appetizer, enjoy my entree, and enjoy my dessert. It's very hard for me to enjoy a full meal, because I taste every 2 minutes in the kitchen.\n\nI'm not very good at sitting down for 3 hours to enjoy a meal. I'd be lying if I told you \"I sit down 4 nights a week and have a 3 course dinner.\" I do nothing of the sort. \n\nAnd also, there's nothing worse than eating dinner at 5:30 and then having to get up and cook for 3 hours. So I like to keep on my toes, and eat small bits. Almost like in Hong Kong - 4 or 5 times a day, small bowls of food. ",

Two weeks ago, I was at a parent's meeting for my school. And my daughter said \"*Daddy, please don't embarrass me.\"*\n\nSO I get to the school and the first thing that happens - there's all these mums and dads there, and all the teachers are there, with the names on the table, and I see the head-mistress, and my daughter Holly was there, and it's *incredible* - I went straight up to the head-mistress and asked for a selfie! Which I thought was fucking brilliant.\n\nMy daughter dived under the table in embarrassment. But it just broke the ice. These things are just so formal.\n\nAnd the head-mistress said \"*Oh my LORD, I've never had a selfie before! What do we do!?!?\"*\n\nSo I said \"Put your head up and fucking smile!\"\n\nI tweeted it out. God bless 'er. ",

Brown rice? Phenomenal. You don't need expensive proteins. Just make them incredible with how you cook them, or prepare them - a pressure cooker is a great way of making these foods go a long way, is to cook them deliciously. Chilis, garlic, definitely. ",

I love to cook, but unfortunately my 80 hour workweek does not allow me more than a day to catch up on shopping, cleaning laundry and food prep.  and yes, i cook every meal.  no fast food, no junk food.

He didn't want pampering, he wanted to roll his sleeves up and dive in there.\n\nHe said \"Gordon, I just want you to teach me to put food on a plate, because it's really magical how you put food on the plate the way you do.\"\n\nSo I'm very excited for this movie, coming out, called ADAM JONES. It's very exciting to see an actor understand what you do, and knowing that he can't learn how to cook in a few months, but absolutely *nailing* it when it came to the level of presentation. \n",

I work my ass off - you know, 15, 16 hours a day. I quite enjoy the time difference when I finish, for instance, last night we were taping MASTER CHEF until 9 or 10 PM at night, I'll have a quick bite to eat, and then I'll call the UK at midnight - because come midnight LA time, West Coast time, it's 8 o'clock in the morning. I'll say good morning to the kids, I'll catch up with my business in London, and then from 2-5 o'clock, I sleep, get up, go to the gym, and then start my day again.\n\nSo that's my daily slog.\n\nSo I stand by my convictions - when I opened up the restaurant, Gordon Ramsay, back in September 1998, I decided I was going to work my ass off. My flagship restaurant in Chelsea has never been open on a Saturday and Sunday - it's never been open on a week-end, because I thought if we're going to do this, I'd like to do this properly, so my staff needs time off. So I work hard, but I give myself time off on the week-end. I cut it off, and power down for 48 hours. ",

We also loved all of the adventures and animal raising that happened throughout the series. Thank you for that. \n\nMy question: outside of your own restaurants, where are some of your favorite places to eat? What dishes do you order?",

How often do you go out for lunch or dinner, and you don't know where the food comes from? So the F Word tried to show the importance of that journey.\n\nI've become a big fan of Vietnamese and Cambodian food. Because they cook with very little dairy. SO everything was tasty, but incredibly healthy at the same time. Great use of spice, broth, pork, a way of eating *well* but also JUST on the cusp of trying to stay healthy at the same time. \n\nSo, you know, when I travel across the US, I always try to get off the sort of main \"foodie\" - the main, sort of high streets, and get into little foodie quarters. If it's South New Orleans, or Austin Texas, I'm going for the latest little thing that's just opened. So I'm pretty low-key like that. I like going into some sort of off the beaten track areas. ",

So I needed a bigger sort of commitment, to spend a little bit more time to myself. So - listen - I love running, but it's given me quality time to spend on my own.

And I'm now on the verge of actually feeling sorry for them, because it's not correct.\n\nThey're one of a kind. \n\nI have no desire to come back. It was the only time I ever threw the towel in - where I physically *can't* do any more.\n\nWe tried so hard for that program, you know. We left them with descriptions to get the business back successfully, and even if restaurants don't follow your recommendations, you still get blamed for it.\n\nI'm frustrated with them. And I just wish they'd listen.\n\nYou know, them becoming sort of big online - I've seen some of the stuff they've been doing and saying, and it's quite embarrassing. It's quite embarrassing, in terms of what they're doing.\n\nI just wish they'd put their heads down, and let their business, you know, think for itself, rather than trying to react to every little sort of negativity.\n\nSo, yeah... they seem to go out on a limb to attack people, and take great pleasure in attacking people.\n\nIt's a bit weird. They've become so successful, for being so bad... ",

My dream is to have my own kitchen one day, and I'm trying my hardest and working my ass off as a prep cook right now. Anyways, I'm a huge fan of your cooking, and have been watching you on television since I was a child, so I'd love your input on a couple things:\n\n1. What's the biggest piece of advice you can give a young, aspiring chef?\n\n\n2. This is a harder question to ask, but I would really love your input on it if you can spare it; I've been pretty severally allergic to dairy and eggs my whole life. I've learned to cook with them at work, but obviously I don't use them at home because they would kill me. Do you feel that it's worth trying to find and fabricate milk, cream, egg, and cheese substitutes? Or do you think that those things would be impossible to truly \"replicate\" and that I should focus on developing recipes that are delicious without needing those elements?\n\nThank you, Chef! ",

                    "comment": "1.) Ehm, good question. The biggest piece of advice - you know, cooking is about character. It's about different cuisines. And I think sometimes we go into it a little bit blinkered-vision. *Learn* a second vision - I thought I really knew how to cook when I worked for Marco and then when I went to France, it really opened my eyes. So learn a second language, and *travel.* It's really important to travel. That is *fundamental.* because you pick up so many different techniques, and learning a second language gives you so much more confidence in the kitchen. \n\n2.) Very good question. First of all, you know, you can't find a substitute for such incredible ingredients. It's very, very difficult. So, you know, a lot of difficulties in terms of trying to find substitutes, so you have to develop recipes with  great alternates. I was recently sent an amazing array of sauces, and dishes, by a company that didn't use eggs. The company was called \"Just Mayo\" but it was done without eggs yet it tasted ABSOLUTELY incredible. So try to figure out a recipe without eggs, because when it's that dangerous, the backlash could be *incredible.* ",

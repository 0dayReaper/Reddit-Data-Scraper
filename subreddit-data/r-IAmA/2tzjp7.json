(Short answer: Just like drinking any other kind of water, except that people get a little freaked out by the whole idea.)\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI hope you\u2019ll take a few minutes to look at the **annual** **letter** that Melinda and I just published ([gatesletter.com](http://gatesletter.com)). This year we make the case that in the next 15 years, life will improve faster for people in poor countries than it ever has before.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Proof:** http://i.imgur.com/lBMmhsA.gif\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BillGates/status/560503503274008576\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**UPDATE:** I have to go. But thanks for all the questions. This really is a fantastic community: Thanks! http://i.imgur.com/aHGlmuI.gifv\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI\u2019d like to sign off with one last plug for the Annual Letter, www.gatesletter.com, and my blog, www.thegatesnotes.com. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**FINAL UPDATE:** Thanks for joining in, Reddit. I knew all that time I spent writing signs would pay off: http://youtu.be/9p4bm-RAlLA\n",

They're so effective that for a time they had eradicated many childhood diseases that were common in the 50's and early 60's. When I was growing up in the 80's and 90's, I would read books with characters that had the measels, for instance, but to me 'measels' was merely a word. I've never had measels or even seen someone afflicted with it. Same with Whooping Cough, rubella, polio, mumps, etc. Those diseases didn't exist in my world. I only met one polio survivor in my entire life, and he was a very old man in a wheelchair. \n\nSo it's hard for GenXers and Millenials like me to truly grasp the threat those diseases present. Because we never spent any of our time worried about them, they're not a threat. In the vast majority of cases, if we don't get a vaccine and don't vaccinate our kids, nothing happens.\n\nEssentially, because my generation didn't grow up with the diseases we're now immunized against, it's difficult for us to judge based on our own personal experience the danger these diseases present. Our forebearers' had direct experience and thus to them the vaccines were a godsend.",

The idea that you have to find applications and pick them and they each are trying to tell you what is new is just not the efficient model - the agent will help solve this.

A great jug of maple syrup and the book The Promise of a Pencil. All very thoughtful. Last year I waited and nothing came. \n\n**EDIT:** More to come soon: http://i.imgur.com/pg8ZbLQ.jpg\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**EDIT 2:** Reddit just let me know that I did get a gift last year: a generous donation to [Heifer International](http://www.heifer.org/), a great non-profit that helps fight poverty and hunger around the world. So, thank you /u/SailorKingCobra, my Secret Santa!&amp;nbsp;\n\n**EDIT 3:** I\u2019m jumping back into the thread to thank /u/bfarnsey for the generous gifts. The quilt is amazing! /u/sillygirlsarah made it in just a week\u2014I don\u2019t know a ton about quilting, but I understand that\u2019s really fast. The Snoo on there is a very nice touch. To show my appreciation, the quilt is being featured as my cover photo on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BillGates) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BillGates).\n\nThe Promise of a Pencil looks interesting. It touches on two key areas: improving education in the developing world and inspiring talented young people to get involved with global issues. Adam Braun\u2019s story is a good one and I\u2019m eager to learn more.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love maple syrup? Especially from Vermont. A nice personal touch given that this is the kind /u/bfarnsey grew up with.\n\nThanks again to a terrific Secret Santa.",

We've all seen the [images](http://newtelegraphonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/polio-victims.jpg) of [crippled](http://socioecohistory.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/indian-boy-with-polio.jpg) [children](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140305152904-polio-patient-feet-india-story-top.jpg), or of [rows of kids in iron lungs](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/20/Iron_lungs.JPG/1280px-Iron_lungs.JPG) \n\nBut did you that the reason we are **this close** to actually eliminating polio is largely due to a few key private organizations? \n\nIn 1985, Rotary International made a pledge to eliminate polio around the world. As of this year, **Rotary has raised over 1.3 billion dollars** in the fight against polio. It is the largest private immunization project in the history of the world, and the total funds raised actually eclipse the GDP of many of the countries in which they work. \n\nOver 2 billion children have been immunized by Rotary, and polio has almost been completely eradicated. In 2014 there were approximately ~~175~~ 356 (thanks /u/Keyframe) polio cases TOTAL. \n\nHowever, it is a slippery disease, and unless we keep pressing, it spreads like wildfire. \n\nRotary are one of the good guys, with 89% of funding going to actual eradication, 9% to fundraising, and a mere 2% going to administration. \n\n**If you want to know more, or give to this important cause (a child can be immunized for life for $0.60 USD), check out [End Polio](http://www.endpolio.org/about-polio).** \n\nThe only [remaining endemic countries are Pakistan, Nigeria, and Afghanistan](http://www.polioeradication.org/dataandmonitoring/poliothisweek.aspx). You can imagine why it is so difficult to reach these areas, and why this last push is so critically important. But it is equally important that we maintain our vaccination program here at home. **Polio is easily spread and all it takes is one infected child - this is not a \"third world issue\"!!**\n\nIf you see fit to donate, you should know that between now and 2018, the **Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation** will match **TWO dollars to every dollar donated through Rotary.** This is it guys, we can actually get over the hump and wipe this awful disease out forever!

The system the rich world uses of pumping in clean water and pumping it to a processing plant is too expensive. I challenged engineers to create a processor of sewage where the costs could be covered by the energy and water (clean water) that it outputs. We have made progress on that. One team, Janicki, which was written up in Wired, is send a prototype machine to Senegal later this year. Getting rid of sewage helps a lot to reduce disease and improve living conditions.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**EDIT:** Speaking of the OmniProcessor. You inspired me to post a photo over in /r/photoshopbattles.

Considering that the people of this country are not having a very comfortable time, you can't perhaps, blame them for being somewhat callous about suffering elsewhere, but the remarkable thing is the extent to which they manage to be unaware of it. Tales of starvation, ruined cities, concentration camps, mass deportations, homeless refugees, persecuted Jews \u2014 all this is received with a sort of incurious surprise, as though such things had never been heard of but at the same time were not particularly interesting. The now-familiar photographs of skeleton-like children make very little impression. As time goes on and the horrors pile up, the mind seems to secrete a sort of self-protecting ignorance which needs a harder and harder shock to pierce it, just as the body will become immunised to a drug and require bigger and bigger doses.\n\n-George Orwell, \"As I Please,\" The Tribune (17 January 1947)\n\nEDIT: see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion_fatigue",

Canada does some of this like the United States. We need to raise African productivity by 1.5 to 2x in order for them to avoid malnutrition and be able to lift themselves out of poverty. It is strange a continent with 70% adults as farmers imports food from countries like the US with 2% farmers. Africa spends $50B net buying food today. With productivity improvement they can offset the weather getting worse and feed their children enough to thrive.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**EDIT**: You can read our letter here: www.gatesletter.com",

I know your foundation focuses largely on global health issues, but do you have thoughts on research back here in the USA? Governmental funding is reaching dangerously low levels, and many bright and talented clinicians and scientists aren't even applying for federal grants knowing they have little chance of being funded. What can we do about this? \n\nAs an aside, I am about to launch a non-profit dedicated to crowdfunding individual medical research projects. I'm working with little entrepreneurial experience or backing but a ton of passion and experience in the healthcare field--do you have any suggestions or is there anyone at your foundation who might take a few minutes to offer some advice?\n\nEdit: whoops. Reddit ate the end of my post.",

Government (and Foundation) funding of research helps but it still should be more. The United States funds a lot more than any other country even relative to its success. It should do more medical and energy and educational and other research. Politicians often think short term unless the voters tell them to avoid that. Perhaps the most outrageous thing is we have not raised Energy research funding to help solve climate change!",

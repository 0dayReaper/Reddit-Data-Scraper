    "postText": "Hey everybody! I'm Andrew. I'm in a band based in Las Vegas called The Delta Bombers. We used to be a straight forward rockabilly band, but now we're more of an Americana meat grinder. We have a [new album out called 'Neon Sounds'](https://ffm.to/neonsounds) and we're going on tour this month with Reverend Horton Heat and later on in the year in Germany. Would love to chat about the fine art of tour traveling and/or geopolitics.\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/EQi4mio](https://imgur.com/a/EQi4mio)",

They have a really cool little central kitchen where you can order hot food from a touch screen. It isnt the healthiest but it just as fresh as any fast food.   \n\n\nthe WaWa pretzels and iced teas are very addictive btw.   \n\n\nLove's truck stops are great for healthier options. They usually have a big section of cut meats and fruit. We really haven't been able to crack the code on consistent good hot meals on the road though. The closest we've come is taking heating elements into our hotel rooms and making a ground beef / veggie stir fry. That's about the best there is!",

As a family we went to Switzerland and Venice last year. This year we went to Spain Portugal and Morocco for two weeks! I had taken my wife on several European vacations before we left our 20\u2019s.  This is all because a lot of my travel and lodging is funded by show promoters. \n\nSo we\u2019ve had really good life experiences especially for my boy.",

I have a wife and a 5 year old son. When I\u2019m not on tour I\u2019m at home. I get to have 200+ days a year at home with kind of work from home type situation because I make a lot of my bands merch and work on stuff from our home office.\u201d\n\nSo idk, seems like they\u2019re home a fair amount. At the very least, it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re home dramatically less than someone who travels somewhat regularly for a \u201creal\u201d job. I\u2019ve got friends who work in marketing that are gone more days out of the year than that, for instance. \n\nMore importantly, though, it also doesn\u2019t seem like you (or anyone in this thread, for that matter) really know all that much about this person, their wife, their child, or anything else to be making such strong, baseless, and angry assumptions about them.\n\nAnd based on your recent comment history, I\u2019ll just say is that I hope you\u2019re able to work through whatever you\u2019ve got going on and arrive somewhere more mentally and emotionally peaceful. \n\nHave a good day \u270c\ud83c\udffb",

I\u2019ve been to Germany a bunch and I love getting the bratwursts at the gas stations with way too small a bun and a side of simple mustard and sauerkraut. Damn I\u2019m hungry now! \n\n\n\nOverall anything that\u2019s made by a local butcher is gonna be good. I\u2019ve had some amazing home made brats in the midwestern usa. The store bought one\u2019s often have a weird after taste",

One time in England we went into this little green room next to the stage to put our show clothes on before we hit the stage. Big festival! A few thousand people. We went to leave as our name was announced and the door knob broke off. We all started dying laughing but realized we were legitimately stuck in there. We tried to shoulder it a bit but the door opened inwards so it wasn\u2019t going to do the trick. Fortunately the show promoters daughter was able to barrel through the door on the other side. It was really a moment we were all practically screaming with laughter as we went on stage.",

I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen 10 years from now but most people are not interested in rock n roll. That\u2019s alright.

The quintessential rockabilly guitar was an orange gretsch so I got the cheap electrometric version and then moved onto my own thing through experimentation.\n\nI would try to accept that most tone is in the fingertips. Jimi hendrix would sound like jimi hendrix playing through a $120 Squier Bullet or a James Hetfield ESP.\n\nA quality tube amp like a Vox AC15 or Fender Deluxe Reverb is almost as much amp as there is in existence. You can pay $4000 more for a marginally better amp or just stick with trusted work horses that sound great.\n\nLong story short, learn music and focus on your playing! The tone and style will come. Become obsessed with learning songs and the music and you can't go wrong. Equipment will come and go",

Nearly went bankrupt but our fans came through for us huge buying a load of merch for a tour that got cancelled. \n\nNot much is different now. There were lots of confusing hybrid rules last year and the year before but now things are basically the same as they\u2019ve always been. I\u2019m thankful for that. \n\nI never doubted the lethality and virality of the virus in the beginning but I will admit I got annoyed later on during the pandemic when it was obvious it wasn\u2019t as lethal as it was in the beginning. I know that\u2019s easy for me to say having been almost unaffected by the virus. Our bass player lost his dad to it :/ it was tough.\n\nLong story short the rules towards the end were kind of annoying because it was obvious everyone was getting it precautions or not. They made live music hard but I\u2019m just happy it\u2019s mostly over.",

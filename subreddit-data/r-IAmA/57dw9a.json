    "postText": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI\u2019m just a normal guy, who spends his free time with his hot wife and cat in St. Louis. I didn\u2019t see any of this coming, it\u2019s been a crazy week. I want to make something good come out of this moment, so I\u2019m donating a portion of the proceeds from my Represent T-Shirt campaign to the St. Patrick Center raising money to fight homelessness in St. Louis.\n\nI\u2019m an open book doing this AMA at my desk at work and excited to answer America\u2019s question.\n\nPlease support the campaign and the fight on homelessness! [Represent.com/bonezone](https://represent.com/bonezone/)\n\nProof: http://i.imgur.com/GdMsMZ9.jpg\n\nEdit: signing off now, just like my whole experience so far this has been overwhelmingly positive!  Special thanks to my Reddit brethren for sticking up for me when the few negative people attack.  Let's just show that we're better than that by not answering hate with hate.  Maybe do this again in a few weeks when the ride is over if you have questions about returning to normal.\n\nMy client will be answering no further questions.\n\nNEW EDIT:  This post is about to be locked, but questions are still coming in.  I made a new AMA to keep this going.  [You can find it here!](https://redd.it/63posi)\n\n",

Here I am bringing all my stuff to a bigger, better house, thinking what hot shit I am for affording the place.  \n\nThen I see him and realize that he has literally nothing but the sign in his hand.  People driving by him giving him no more mind than a street sign or a shrub.  I drove on by, reasoning that I was too busy to stop and help him out, it was moving day.  Somebody else will give him a couple bucks.  I never saw him again.  \n\nIs he OK?  Did he move on out of town?  Turn his life around?  Die in a gutter OD'd on heroin?  I'll never know cause I didn't give him the time of day.  I was too busy pretending I had arrived.  \n\nThese are people who deserve love and happiness as much as me or anyone.  But that day to me he was a shrub.  Never again.",

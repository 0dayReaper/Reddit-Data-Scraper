If you're looking to jump right into this specific industry, I'd recommend starting with a consulting firm that would allow you to learn more about the profession. If you have time to spare, which at your age you do, I'd recommend building up your domain experience in whatever industry you're interested in and transferring into consulting later.",

Looking back though, from the beginning of my career, I was always picked for taskforces or other growth initiatives. So even before I was consulting, I was consulting!\n\nAs for my education, I have both a bachelor and master in Business Administration. The former from Grand Valley State University and the latter from University of Michigan. My longest non-consulting stint was in sales at Xerox for about 15 years.",

If you're a process consultant, you'll most likely focus in on a skill that can be applied equally across various industries, such as IT integration, pricing, or salesforce management. If you're a problem-solving consultant, you have to have techniques and practices that allow you to quickly learn about an industry, both theoretically and empirically. For someone working as the latter, continuous learning is key.",

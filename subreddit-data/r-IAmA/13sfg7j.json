    "postText": "Hey Reddit!\n\nOver 40% of first marriages in the US end in divorce. This number is even higher for a second (60%) or third (73%) marriage.\n\nDivorce is one of the most stressful life events a person can experience. The only thing more stressful is the death of a spouse. Divorce is an enormous decision that requires a second look and a lot of consideration.\n\nI am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and I specialize in helping couples on the brink of divorce decide what to do with their marriage. The process is called Discernment Counseling.\n\nThe goal of discernment counseling is for each partner to get clarity and confidence about the future direction of their marriage. Their work is to identify how their marriage got to this point, and to take accountability for what their personal contribution has been. Then, they decide whether or not those issues can be worked on in therapy.\n\nHappy to answer any questions!\n\nDisclaimer: I can\u2019t provide therapy on Reddit or any other social media platform. Please call 911 if you\u2019re experiencing a mental health emergency.\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/zYBH1Cl](https://imgur.com/a/zYBH1Cl)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit: Closing up for the day. Thank you everyone for the excellent and thoughtful questions. This was really fun. I work with clients in Massachusetts, Oregon, and Florida. I am available for consultations or if you need a referral. For more information, please** [**check out my website**](https://www.bridgetownclinical.com/)**.**\n\n**To find a discernment counselor in your area,** [**click here**](https://discernmentcounselors.com/)**.**",

This means that the domestic violence is part of a person's personality, and not confined to situations when conflict spins out of control. My other thoughts such as affairs and addiction would really depend on the context and nuance of the relationship. But, I think characterological DV is a solid reason to divorce 10/10 times.  \n\n\nIn regards to your second question, my answer is: doing your own personal work to change whatever it is that you contributed to the breakdown of your first marriage. You can't divorce yourself, and whatever bad behavior you had in your first marriage will carry over into the second - unless you actively work to identify it and change that behavior.",

There's a huge difference between a *batterer,* and a person who loses his or her cool during an argument. Characterological domestic violence is highly unlikely to change. Researchers have said it is likely due to early childhood trauma, most likely witnessing the same type of domestic violence between parents.",

It's your attitudes, moods, opinions, values, interests, and behavior. Another way to say it is: your attitudes, moods, opinions, values, interests all *expressed through* your behavior. Someone once explained it as the way you relate to the world and that resonated with me.  \nIn the context of this specific type of domestic violence, the perpetrators usually have personality disorders, for example Antisocial Personality Disorder. With that situation, the person lacks empathy, has a volatile mood, believes the rules don't apply to them, holds themselves as more important than others, is vindictive, etc. Those beliefs, moods, etc. are then expressed in behavior - in this case battery - that is often criminal and victimizing.",

I suspect your wife would feel differently if the two of you had more frequent and established emotional touch points that she could count on.",

For example, before you leave for your outing and she's working, sit down and ask her about her day, ask about the specifics what she has going on that particular day, tell her specifics about your plans. Connect with her before you leave. An example of a coming-home ritual could be a hug, a 6-second kiss (Dr. Gottman recommends this!) and ask her about her day, tell her about your outing, etc. You'll have to make it work for your life and your circumstances, but rituals around leaving and coming home are important.

Criticism - attacking your partner, blaming your partner, character assassination, questions that aren't real questions but hidden insults. Examples: \"you never pick up after yourself\" or \"what were you thinking?!\" \n2. Contempt - acting superior to your partner and/or disgusted by them\n3. Stonewalling - a lack of communication, responsiveness, eye contact, physically turning away from them during an argument\n4. Defensiveness - either counter-attacking your partner or being an indignant victim\n\n* Interestingly, going to individual therapy for marital problems also predicts divorce, but the above four are a lot more salient.\n\nFor couples who are dating or engaged, it's really important to build a culture of appreciation in the relationship. It helps mitigate conflict and builds intimacy. All that means is that partners say thank you to each other for the mundane things as well as the big things.\n\n  \nI also recommend partners dedicate an hour a week to talking about the relationship. Discuss what's working, what's not working, share appreciations, and tell the other person how they can make them feel loved this week.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for saying that. It's honestly maybe my least favorite aspect of couples therapy. It can be very triggering and overwhelming for me.\n\nI often talk about \"flooding\" with couples, meaning: a person gets so overwhelmed by the conflict that their brain shuts down and they can't effectively participate in solving the problem: your heart rate gets above 100 beats/minute, you get tunnel vision, your blood pressure increases, you can't perspective-take or be compassionate anymore. I talk about this because it's really important for partners to understand how their bodies feel when they start to ramp up. Relationships in which partners can take a break before getting to that point have a much higher success rate. But, this takes practice because we don't really feel overwhelmed at 100 beats per minute...we feel it at 120 or 140! But by then we are too far gone.\n\nWhen the fighting happens in session, I point out that one or both of them might be flooded, and I also might be flooded as the therapist. We take a break so everyone can calm down, and then talk about how to avoid flooding in the future, ie: how not to attack and criticize your partner when you need to bring up an issue.",

There are a few that are about intimacy specifically, and others that are more generally for marital dissatisfaction. Books like \"The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work\" by Dr. John Gottman is one example. That might help loosen her anxiety about talking about the subject, and hopefully eventually she would be more open to the thought of involving a third party.  \n\n\nAnother thought is along the same line as the book. Seeing if she would go with you to a marriage workshop. These are more educational, but similar to the book idea they will give you some concrete tools for conflict, compromise, intimacy, etc. The Gottman Institute has workshops around the world, and so does Sue Johnson who created Emotionally Focused Therapy. Those workshops are called \"Hold Me Tight\" and so is her book.  \n\n\nA final idea is to see a couples therapist by yourself. Discernment counselors have a protocol for partners who want to work on the marriage but their spouse refuses to go to therapy. It's called \"Hopeful Spouse Counseling.\" That's usually reserved for a scenario in which your wife is thinking of leaving the marriage, but I think talking with a trained couples therapist can be useful for you even by yourself because of their skill set. Individual therapists, if not careful, can unintentionally push partners further apart. In fact, individual therapy for marriage problems predicts divorce. So, I would be wary of that.  \n\n\nIt also may be very difficult for her to go into that conversation with you because the child issue is one where there isn't much room for compromise, and I would guess the prospect of having either a relationship-ending or dream-crushing conversation is intimidating. Keep your compassion for her, but continue to push for the help the relationship needs.",

                    "comment": "These questions are excellent and I'm glad you asked them!\n\nThere are seven principles that make a marriage go the distance:\n\n1. Knowing your partner, not just their quirks and sense of humor, but knowing what makes them tick, what triggers them, what their hopes and dreams are, their perspectives, what their insecurities and anxieties are, really KNOWING them. If you don't, become a good listener. Ask open-ended questions, listen to the answer, and remember it.\n2. Sharing what you like, appreciate, and admire about them - out loud, on a regular basis. Multiple times a day. It doesn't have to be a big proclamation but it needs to be iterated.\n3. Turning toward each other, instead of away when they make a \"bid\" for connection or attention. For example, you're sitting on the couch watching TV and your spouse makes a comment about something your dog just did. Don't grunt in response, don't ignore it, and don't tell her you're too busy. Turn around and engage with her about the dog. Or the rain, or her day at work, or her mom's cancer diagnosis, whatever small or big thing it is.\n4. Letting your partner influence you, meaning, you can validate their point of view and feelings about something even if you don't agree. You can acknowledge and validate without agreeing, and while still maintaining your own perspective or experience.\n5. Solving the problems that can be solved in the relationship, meaning: coming to compromise when possible. Remember, in a compromise, *both* people lose something and *both* people gain something.\n6. When the problems are not solvable, develop dialogue about the unsolvable issue instead of getting entrenched into your position and therefore ignoring your spouse's feelings or perspective.\n7. Creating shared meaning together - have rituals, traditions, and a culture within your relationship of how you approach life. Decide what \"home\" means, what \"play\" means, what \"sex\" means, etc. Have goals together that you work towards. It could be as straightforward as being a specific type of parents, or saving for a certain kind of retirement, how you approach wellness together, etc.\n\nHope this helps!",

It's very hard to take a look at your own behavior when you're focused on how much your spouse has hurt you. So, I help people look at what their role in the dynamic has been. I can see it easier because I'm an outsider and I have a much different perspective than someone who has been hurt time and time again. I point out to both parties how they have hurt each other, misunderstood each other, and how they've taken each other for granted for years.\n\nThen the partners themselves decide whether or not the things they have contributed to the marriage can be worked on. I will give some examples of how we could work on it in couples therapy, but we don't actually work on the marriage until both parties have agreed to participate fully in couples therapy.\n\nIn discernment counseling, because it is so focused on the individual's influence on the relationship, it is successful if someone learns more about themselves and how their behavior is part of a system. It's a success if both spouses can honestly say, \"I recognize how my behavior influenced my spouse to behave in this way.\" I would consider this a success even if they choose not to work on the marriage.",

She has a perspective you don't agree with or understand, but it isn't irrational. I would start by asking her open-ended, nonjudgmental questions and getting to the bottom of why she feels the way she does.\n\nFor more productive conversations, I always ask partners about how they started the conversation to begin with. 97% of the time (so basically all of the time) the way a conflict conversation starts predicts how it ends. If you start the conversation with a criticism, or an insult, or an invalidation, or something negative, your result will also be negative. \n\nHere is something you can try that will curb the negativity:\n\nState your emotion (an actual *emotion*, not a judgment of your partner!) and what you need from her in the future.\n\n\"I feel \\_\\_\\_\\_ when \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ happens. I need \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ from you.\"\n\n\"I get upset when the dishes aren't put away like we agreed on. I need you to put them away before we go to bed.\"\n\nSteer clear of \"I feel like you...\" because that's not an emotion.\n\nYour wife ends up emotional and disrespectful most likely because she is flooded, meaning she is emotionally overwhelmed and she can't be present and effectively participate in the conversation. You are also probably flooded. In this case, make sure to take breaks often during conflict for at least 20-30 minutes at a time, and make sure to tell your partner when you'll come back to the conversation so they don't think you've just disappeared. Distract yourself during the 20-30 minutes so that your biology can settle.\n\nI hope this helps!",

That being said, I\u2019d take a look at when and how you\u2019ve brought it up in the past. If it\u2019s brought up during conflict, your wife might think you want to go to therapy because you think she\u2019s crazy, or so you and the therapist can gang up on her, or something like that.

I would also pitch \u201cinterviewing\u201d therapists, meaning attending a free consultation either on video or in person. That way she can get a sense of who you will be working with.

Everyone makes their own decisions. We would want to look at what happened in the relationship prior to the infidelity.\n\nFor your husband, there are two discernment processes taking place: the first would be discerning whether or not to end the affair(s), and the second is discerning whether or not to work on the marriage with you in therapy.\n\nAnother thing to note is that if you and your husband went through discernment counseling and you did decide to stay married and work on the relationship, a lot of couples therapists (myself included), will not treat a couple when there is active infidelity. So, he would have to truly end the affairs in order to move forward. (Of course, there's no bulletproof way to verify that he isn't engaging in an affair, but it would likely come out later.)",

    "postText": "EDIT: Wow, thank you for all your comments and questions today. It's time to relax and get ready for bed, so I need to wrap this up. In general, I do come to reddit almost daily, although I may not always comment.\n\nI love doing AMAs, and plan to continue to do them as often as I can, time permitting. Otherwise, you can find me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/donttrythis), Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/therealadamsavage/) or Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/therealadamsavage/). And for those of you who live in the 40 cities I'll be touring in next year, I hope to see you then.\n\nThanks again for your time, interest and questions. Love you guys!\n\nHello again, Reddit! I am unemployed explosives expert Adam Savage, maker, editor-in-chief of Tested.com and former host of MythBusters. It's hard to believe, but MythBusters stopped filming just over a YEAR ago (I know, right?). I wasn't sure how things were going to go once the series ended, but between filming with Tested and helping out the White House on maker initiatives, it turns out that I'm just as busy as ever. If not more so. thankfully, I'm still having a lot of fun.\n\nPROOF: https://twitter.com/donttrythis/status/804368731228909570\n\nBut enough about me. Well,  this whole thing is about me, I guess. But it's time to answer questions. Ask me anything!\n",

Actually seeing it happen, and seeing a random thought which had been nagging in my mind for years being actually played out on TV by you guys (with helicopters and everything!) was so extremely satisfying, I can hardly describe. I was thrilled to have been able to contribute in some way to a show I loved. \n\nMy actual question though, as this is an AMA... one of the myths that always gripped me was the Nikola Tesla \"earthquake\" machine. In the episode you managed to make a small, simple machine which, at the right resonant frequency, could be felt right the way along a massive bridge. Both yours and Jamies change from joking about how such a machine could never work, to suddenly seeming somewhat plausible and even alarming, is one of my absolute highlights from the years of that show. Were you ever tempted to return to testing that machine? It always seemed like there was more to it and some untapped potential - perhaps with a slightly larger device.  \n\nThanks. ",

It helped me decide that I wanted to pursue a career in civil engineering, and now in my third year as a CE student I couldn't be happier with my decision. So thank you so much for that, and also for participating in this AMA today!\n\nSo my question for you is, is there any myth that you wanted to do but didn't have the right technology? If so, do you think it'll ever be possible to test it?\n\n-Briana",

I like building stuff, dissasembling stuff, reverse engineering stuff and inventing stuff. Ever since I put a can of hairspray on a bonfire and got a huge fireball I've also been intrigued by explosives. Now obviously I don't make bombs in my spare time, closest I got was took the innards of a bunch of boxes of fun snaps, put them in a sandwich bag and sealed it. That made a loud bang.\n\nI'd love to play with bombs and seeing what is and isn't explosive, responsibly of course, and if there's any hobbies surrounding bombmaking. \n\nSo is there any avenues I can take without retraining that you know of, or am I already on a watch list by the grace of this comment? \n\nYours most faithfully\n\nSoz im drunk",

She has a busy schedule do to her career, so we try to all be together whenever she is free. On weekends when she has work, I watch our son. While I love spending time with both of them, I also can't help but feel like I don't have time for many creative projects.

That is: that feeling shitty about doing what I do will occur from time to time but doesn't define me. Then it's about pushing past the lack of desire to do anything about it. \n\nHow does one do THAT? For me with any project there's a list of, let's say, 10 things at any given point I know should happen. When I'm feeling really down that might descend to only one thing. Or even half a thing. That is: I can't really see how to proceed and my usual intuition is in the toilet. So I gingerly proceed with that half-a-thing until things start to normalize. Or I go home and recoup and just be ok with not feeling awesome. That's ok too. It's a huge question you're actually asking and it's somewhat of a disservice for me to try and answer in a couple of paragraphs but that's what works for me. Hope it helps.\n",

One problem that I frequently have is getting caught up in the energy of building so much that organization goes completely out the window.  Any tips for keeping the enthusiasm while also being organized?",

The desire to have a strong home life and a successful work life can be so demanding, what are some tips for people to help keep a proper balance?\n\n\nCommentary:\n\nDuring your Tested video \"Adam Savage's One Day Builds: NASA Spacesuit Parts!\" a few mistakes happened during your build, but what you said at the end of the video really hit home with me. (Video Link: https://youtu.be/7JrCejRYGAM?t=55m31s)\n\nYou discussed a maker's \"slump\" and how it can truly rattle you to the core.  I wanted to thank you for those kind words as I myself have been in that position- but it's taken years to realize that it's simply ok to mess up and I'm not a failure haha!   Thank you for showing me that these things happen to the best of us, and it's all about moving forward &lt;3 \n\n-Tony D.\nHuntsville, AL",

Even though I am physically limited by my illness, your creativity is electric and you have instilled in me a deep sense of hope and excitement for learning despite my current situation. Thank you for what you do.\n\nSometimes I am overwhelmed by a sense of inadequacy in myself, that I am not well-versed in art, cinema, culture, etc. On your podcast you have talked about giving your children a well-rounded film education and you have mentioned the process you went through as a teenager discovering new things. To a 19 year old just entering adulthood, what advice do you have? What are some books, films, and experiences that set you on the path of exploration?  ",

    "postText": "Welcome to my Reddit AMA.  Thank you for coming.  My name is [Daryl Davis](https://i.redd.it/5vx78wtmjxlz.jpg) and I am a professional [musician](https://i.redd.it/o74xsdqajxlz.jpg) and actor.  I am also the author of Klan-Destine Relationships, and the subject of the new documentary Accidental Courtesy.  In between leading The Daryl Davis Band and playing piano for the founder of Rock'n'Roll, Chuck Berry for 32 years, I have been successfully engaged in fostering better race relations by having [face-to-face-dialogs](https://i.redd.it/myn3evngjxlz.jpg) with the [Ku Klux Klan](https://i.redd.it/uku4sqejjxlz.jpg) and other White supremacists.  What makes [my](https://i.redd.it/6gi8yhqy5jlz.jpg) [journey](https://i.redd.it/xn26jczw5jlz.jpg) a little different, is the fact that I'm Black.  Please feel free to Ask Me Anything, about anything.\n\n[Proof](https://i.redd.it/lopd1v216jlz.jpg)\n\nHere are some more photos I would like to share with you: [1](https://i.redd.it/de8t8p1ijxlz.jpg), [2](https://i.redd.it/p0g33v6ljxlz.jpg), [3](https://i.redd.it/baf3ni6fjxlz.jpg), [4](https://i.redd.it/78dlg9ldjxlz.jpg), [5](https://i.redd.it/5lfvuo8cjxlz.jpg), [6](https://i.redd.it/rj0q1ya9jxlz.jpg), [7](https://i.redd.it/2qaufg38jxlz.jpg), [8](https://i.redd.it/b7wi0nk76jlz.jpg), [9](https://i.redd.it/ahfzkuu56jlz.jpg)\nYou can find me online here: \n \n - www.DarylDavis.com\n\n - https://www.facebook.com/daryl.davis.104\n\n - http://accidentalcourtesy.com/\n\n - https://www.facebook.com/accidentalcourtesy/\n\n - https://www.amazon.com/Klan-Destine-Relationships-Black-Mans-Odyssey/dp/0882822691\n\nHey Folks,\nI want to thank Jessica &amp; Cassidy and Reddit for inviting me to do this AMA.  I sincerely want to thank each of you participants for sharing your time and allowing me the platform to express my opinions and experiences. Thank you for the questions.  I know I did not get around to all of them, but I will check back in and try to answer some more soon.  I have to leave now as I have lectures and gigs for which I must prepare and pack my bags as some of them are out of town.  Please feel free to visit my website and hit me on Facebook.  I wish you success in all you endeavor to do.  Let's all make a difference by starting out being the difference we want to see.\n\nKind regards,\n\nDaryl Davis",

                    "comment": "Absolutely!!!  Despite what you may have read in the numerous press articles about me converting KKK members, I NEVER set out to convert anyone.  I simply set out to ask a question I had formed in my mind as a kid: \"How can you hate me when you don't even know me?\"  Growing up, we all are told, \"A tiger doesn't change its stripes, a leopard doesn't change its spots,\" etc.  I believed that and I didn't think anyone was going to change, so that wasn't my initial goal.  I just wanted the answer to my question.  But over time, though repeated interactions with various KKK members around the country, some of them began questioning their own beliefs as a result of their interacations and conversations with me.  Then they began quitting, and I was astounded.  Exposure and one-on-one dialogue is the KEY to solving a lot of issues in this country, not just racial ones.  We live in echo chambers in which we surround ourselves with people who will reflect back to us, the very same thing we say to them.  Therefore we block out anything from the outside as being inferior to what we learn in our little bubbles.  I like traveling outside the bubble.  Even people with good intentions, tend to shut out those who may hold different opinions.  I am willing to listen all all.",

They both said that it would help to make them question their own reality and allow them to possibly reach a more logical conclusion on their own rather than trying to force a belief or opinion on them, doing the latter would cause backlash and a stronger attachment to their original belief. I believe this is known as the backfire effect.\nIt makes sense since racism, in a sense, is a sort of delusion(in my opinion). Some people have claimed racism could be a form of mental illness, having similar symptoms to PTSD. What is your take on that perspective? \n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold!",

Their already superior mental state is then stroked. But after a while they realize that it was their interaction with you that led them to this conclusion and they are often grateful for it.",

In order to influence someone with your viewpoint it is better to ask questions which will lead them there. Daryl shows this influence through his seemingly simple question, \"How can you hate me without knowing me?\" It's likely many of these people never had strong convictions, but were parrots until they were asked to think and listened to. \n\nI disdain groups like Antifa (edit: the violent wings of the organization) as they reinforce what you call the original belief and help increase the backfire effect while producing propaganda for these insane groups. If you want peace, do not get into shouting matches and matching violence with violence. Set up tables and provide food/refreshments and TALK - learn about the people marching \"against you\" and ask them questions. The toughest things to do are often the right things to do. ",

To me an ignorant person is someone who makes the wrong decision or a bad choice because he does not have the proper facts to make the correct decision or a good choice.  If you give that person the facts, you have alleviated their ignorance and they can make the right decision.  A stupid person is one who has the facts but still makes the wrong decision.\n\nIf I painted the walls of a room and didn't post any \"WET PAINT' signs, people coming into the room would be ignorant as to the walls being wet and may lean up against the walls, getting paint on their clothing.  I can fix that by posting warning signs and telling each person entering the doorway that the walls are wet and to stay off them.  But, if I go all of that and someone still leans up against the wall and then wants to know why there is paint on their clothes, it's because they are STUPID!!!  There is a cure for ignorance.  That cure is called education.  Unfortunately, there is no cure for stupidity.  If you give someone the education (facts) and they choose not to use them, there is nothing you can do.  :)\n",

This reflects a lack of any meaningful prior exposure to and empathy with the black experience. While it's heartening to see so many change after getting to know you, it does leave me curious - do you think anything similar to your process could be replicated by white anti-racist activists, or is the very fact of your blackness so crucial to the result that white people would have to take a different approach?",

There are those who still pose a threat and will probably do so till they pass away.",

I remember commenting on a forum that the show,  the L Word seemed dumb since it was focused on one sexual persuasion and I didn't think it was good for children to be confused by the representation.  Several people jumped in to tell me what an evil piece of shit I was, and that I should die in a fire. One poster, a lesbian herself, actually engaged me in a discussion to see why I felt that way and provided me with well reasoned and respectful counter-points. I recall her even encouraging others to calm down a bit. The discussion made me realize my view on the subject was wrong and I eventually admitted as much and gained a much needed change of perspective.  Had I only dealt with the initial hatred and social shaming, I probably would have just become more entrenched in my views.",

Maybe anyone else that reads this can give me feedback! I'd love to hear from anyone. \n\nToo many times I have seen on Facebook and other social media where my friends who support BLM and racial equality (and gender identity stuff too) talk VERY condescending and rude to people who ask questions and challenge them. I believe that as soon as you stop talking to the bigoted person as if you are on the same level, they will know, and they will get pissed, and there will be no turning back. To me, typing things in all caps shows that you think are much better, and that your voice needs to be heard, no one else. Saying things like \"All white people are racist\" and the like, while up for debate, really doesn't help at all. If there are white, non-racist, non-bigoted people offended and upset at this, do you really think a racist white people is gonna be on board, and willing to listen to anything you have to say after?\n\nI know I will always try my hardest to support anyone, whether you are, black, white, queer, non binary, or whatever, but it's just so exhausting and damn depressing to hear and see blacks and LGBT supporters talking down and rudely to others. And it honestly makes me feel and question \"why would I support this if these people are assholes?\" And I also think to myself sometimes, \"If I think this, just imagine what racists and bigots think\". I really encourage everyone to read up the story of Johnny Lee Clary, and encourage everyone to practice having debates and discussions like Rev. Wade Watts (and Daryl Davis too!). Because as soon as you stoop down to racists level and start shouting and yelling and calling them ignorant pigs, they won't listen and it will just reaffirm their views. I've been trying to be to be like them too, and I think I've had some success!\n\nI hope this is understandable! It's hard for me to get my feelings and thoughts down to words. Always has been. ",

It hurt me to see the young black gentlemen towards the end get irate and insult you. They seemed to refuse to try and understand what it is you are doing, and why you are doing it. I do not understand having one's thought process be so encompassed by divisiveness that one is less willing to engage in open dialogue than even the KKK themselves. I think with time and enough people like you, that mindset will slowly begin to fade out of our culture. I think you're doing amazing things and I am very inspired by your work. Thank you for all you do, Mr. Davis.",

We are not going to let spics and niggers take over our country.\"\n\nYet others join because the environment in which they live, is conducive to that mentality and in order to get along with your neighbors, you join the local societal groups, garden club, PTA, KKK, etc.",

It was created to bring the national spotlight on the disproportionate number of Black males who for lack of a better term, are being murdered by White police officers, when White males in the same circumstances are not.  Blacks go to their graves and Whites go to jail or go home.\n\nThe way to change that, is to bring national attention to the plight.  Just like MLK did with Rosa Parks and riding the bus in Montgomery, Alabama.  Ms. Parks was not the first woman who refused to give up her seat. That had been going on.  But when MLK organized the Bus Boycott and it drew national attention for almost a year, the laws were changed, which is why I can sit anywhere I want to on the bus today.\n\nSo the formation of BLM was a good idea.  Where I believe it fell short, is in the fact it was not centralized and not trademarked.  In otherwords, there is no central BLM in which policy is created and then disseminated to chapters all over the country so everyone is on the same page.  The NAACP, the Boy Scouts of America, the Red Cross, would be some example of centralized organizations.  They are run top down.  BLM is run bottom up.  In this case it has not worked to their advantage in that they have chapters that have sprouted up all over the country and each one is autonomous.  Therefore there are those who are aggressive and disruptive, while there are those who are more constructive and instructive.  The negative actions always make the news media and of course, casts a bad light on the the ones doing positive things, because people just say BLM, without realizing that each chapter is not connected to another.

Many of them have been brain washed to believe that Blacks have smaller brains than Whites, therefore, we are not as intelligent, nor are we capable of acquiring higher intelligence.  Due to this defect, we are predisposed to laziness, and violence.  They will often cite the book The Bell Curve, which most of them haven't read, but someone told them about it.  You know who that goes.  This person said that, who told someone else, who then told another person and so on. Next thing you know, it's the Gospel truth.\n\nI find things we have in common such as getting drugs of the street and better education in our schools, etc.  Building upon these and similar commonalities, are the first steps to a relationship.  Building upon that relationship, is the first step to a friendship.  As you nurture those commonalities, they find the things they had in contrast, such as skin color, begin to matter less and less.",

They did their own conversion. I was simply the impetus for it.  Now understand, when a Klan group falls apart, it does not mean there are no more racists in the area.  It simply means there is no more KKK group. In some cases, some of them renounce their beliefs and some still maintain the beliefs but don't reorganize into a group.

Still hold onto a few obviously racist beliefs that they never quite let go of?  Or do some view you as they \"exception\" while remaining racist against other nob whites?  ",

However, behind closed doors, they are rivals with each other and there is even a lot of in-fighting within each group, which leads to them beoming splinter groups. There is no central KKK organization any longer.",

When I heard all of that in person, it just cuts deep and makes me clench my fist, and I can't imagine having the strength of character you have to confront it in the manner you did. \n\nAll that aside, can I ask what your childhood was like? Were you influenced early on, or did you get inspiration later in life, the inspiration to take on this project? Was there a place you felt like you might actually be in danger while you were visiting? ",

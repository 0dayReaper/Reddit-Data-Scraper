    "postText": " **Hi Reddit, I'm Will Joyce Jr, the COO of Joyce Van Lines Inc. I'm here today to talk about how to avoid moving scammers, brokers and best practices for vetting your moving company before you commit to a company to move all your possessions.** \n\n[**https://www.joycevanlines.com/about**](https://www.joycevanlines.com/about) can verify my position. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/9p6Zpc0](https://imgur.com/a/9p6Zpc0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are a few basic tips to help you avoid moving scammers:\n\n* **Get multiple quotes.** Don't just go with the first moving company that you find. Get quotes from several different companies before making a decision.\n* **Check the company's license and insurance.** Make sure that the moving company is licensed and insured. You can check with your state's Department of Transportation to verify the company's license.\n* **Get everything in writing.** Before you hire a moving company, make sure to get everything in writing. This includes the estimate, the contract, and the insurance information.\n* **Beware of high-pressure sales tactics.** If a moving company is pressuring you to sign a contract right away, be wary. This is a sign that they may be trying to scam you.\n* **Trust your gut.** If you don't feel comfortable with a moving company, don't hire them. It's important to find a company that you feel comfortable with and that you can trust.\n* **Verify they actually have assets.** Truck count and driver count and miles traveled in the last year is available by checking the mover you are wishing to use and their company name. \n* **Only ever put down a small deposit (under 10% of the move) and by credit card.**\n* **Only ever do a weight based move. NEVER DO CUBIC FEET.** All of your rights to fight an overweight shipment are based around you witnessing a reweigh. To go over with cubic feet all that needs to be done is load the shipment poorly then after that you are out of recourse options. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm happy to answer any other questions y'all have about anything in regards to Moving, Storage and Beyond.",

The basic protection of moves at no additional charge is universally 60 cents per pound per article which is very little.\n\n   Second is to take a video of your items before the move. Similarly to when renting a car this will help show that the damage is new.\n\n   Third, document after damage and make sure to email it to the claims department. With documentation it will be an easy case to get set and paid out.",

                    "comment": "   It is important that the company you hire is at least open with who else would be involved prior to you move. Sometimes for small moves especially an interline partner the primary agent knows and trusts will handle the second end of the move or even the whole process but this is also communicated with the customer and only done with their consent. \n\n  For instance, we currently started doing consumer moves for JK moving and storage that they cannot cover themselves but they openly show the customer that their vetted partner Joyce Van Lines can handle the move so it isnt always an evil.\n\n   Just many scam online broker only companies defraud shippers and often get things tied up in ways where their goods are taken hostage by a malicious moving company demanding thousands of more dollars than you agreed upon.\n\n   The first step is to vet the honesty of the business. Moving companies that last need to do right and if things ever go wrong, make them right.\n\n  Once it is established that they care about their reputation the next would be to explain your weariness of brokers and that you want their written confirmation that your move wont be brokered. ALWAYS DO THIS IN WRITING BY EMAIL. The paper trail helps you a ton. Anyone repudiable will respect this as part of the move and be open even in the worst case that the move cannot be handled unless we have a second party involved in a way.",

On the initial estimate you receive common possible additional charges should be listed with cost of service so while these aren\u2019t fun for any party they are a necessary evil. At first be calm and figure out the situation. There are good ways to work with people who handle things reasonably but if you react to a shuttle or long carry having to be added by yelling at the rep the situation is guaranteed to be worse for everyone.\n\n   If it goes from an additional cost to a clear scam hold up the best two routes are to contact the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) asap since they have the authority to investigate movers and take broker hostage complaints very seriously. Then contact a lawyer. The FMCSA is actually currently making a large push to clean up the broker industry as it has gotten out of control over the last few years. Ideally you paid by credit card and also can file a dispute there.\n\n   The downside is the broker model is to farm several future companies, use scam number 1 until it gets too many complaints/legal heat bankrupt it then to move on to one of the other companies they farmed up fake reviews and SEO on. When you sue for financial compensation you often will be trying to milk a rock. The best case is you get back your items back where you started.",

Currently a new air ride trailer for moving costs around $110,000 and a new tractor costs $125,000 minimum for the costs on our end.\n\n   For spots for family\u2019s to save, purge heavy items you don\u2019t use or that aren\u2019t worth at least $1.50 a lb. That\u2019s the very rough cost of a normal sized move by weight. Pricing on interstate moves should always be weight based.\n\n   For local moves that are hourly, mainly having things well organized for your movers generally saves at least an hour of time and cost. \n\n   An interesting spot people often can save too is getting used packing from their moving company. We offer this for free as it helps all party\u2019s involved. Packing costs also have skyrocketed in the last few years.",

    "postText": "Intelligence officials have repeatedly warned that Russian hackers will return to plague the 2020 presidential election, but the decentralized and underfunded U.S. election system has proven difficult to secure. While disinformation and breaches of political campaigns have deservedly received widespread attention, another important aspect is the security of voting machines themselves.\n\n[Hundreds of counties still use paperless voting machines](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/election-security-americas-voting-machines/), which cybersecurity experts say are extremely dangerous because they offer no reliable way to audit their results. Experts have urged these jurisdictions to upgrade to paper-based systems, and lawmakers in Washington and many state capitals are considering requiring the use of paper. But in many states, the responsibility for replacing insecure machines rests with county election officials, most of whom have lots of competing responsibilities, little money, and even less cyber expertise.\n\nTo understand how this voting machine upgrade process is playing out nationwide, Politico surveyed the roughly 600 jurisdictions \u2014 including state and county governments \u2014 that still use paperless machines, asking them whether they planned to upgrade and what steps they had taken. The findings are stark: [More than 150 counties have already said that they plan to keep their existing paperless machines or buy new ones](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2019/election-security-americas-voting-machines/). For various reasons \u2014 from a lack of sufficient funding to a preference for a convenient experience \u2014 [America\u2019s voting machines won\u2019t be completely secure any time soon](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/05/election-security-cybersecurity-1445539).\n\n**Ask us anything**.  ([Proof](https://twitter.com/politico/status/1161300134933618688))\n\nA bit more about us:\n\n**Eric Geller** is the POLITICO cybersecurity reporter behind this project. His beat includes cyber policymaking at the Office of Management and Budget and the National Security Council; American cyber diplomacy efforts at the State Department; cybercrime prosecutions at the Justice Department; and digital security research at the Commerce Department. He has also covered global malware outbreaks and states\u2019 efforts to secure their election systems. His first day at POLITICO was June 14, 2016, when news broke of a suspected Russian government hack of the Democratic National Committee. In the months that followed, Eric contributed to POLITICO\u2019s reporting on perhaps the most significant cybersecurity story in American history, a story that continues to evolve and resonate to this day.\n\nBefore joining POLITICO, he covered technology policy, including the debate over the FCC\u2019s net neutrality rules and the passage of hotly contested bills like the USA Freedom Act and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. He covered the Obama administration\u2019s IT security policies in the wake of the Office of Personnel Management hack, the landmark 2015 U.S.\u2013China agreement on commercial hacking and the high-profile encryption battle between Apple and the FBI after the San Bernardino, Calif. terrorist attack. At the height of the controversy, he interviewed then-FBI Director James Comey about his perspective on encryption.\n\n**J. Alex Halderman** is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan and Director of Michigan\u2019s Center for Computer Security and Society. He has performed numerous security evaluations of real-world voting systems, both in the U.S. and around the world. He helped conduct California\u2019s \u201ctop-to-bottom\u201d electronic voting systems review, the first comprehensive election cybersecurity analysis commissioned by a U.S. state. He led the first independent review of election technology in India, and he organized the first independent security audit of Estonia\u2019s national online voting system. In 2017, he testified to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence regarding Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Elections. Prof. Halderman regularly teaches computer security at the graduate and undergraduate levels. He is the creator of Security Digital Democracy, a massive, open, online course that explores the security risks\u2014and future potential\u2014of electronic voting and Internet voting technologies.\n\n***Update:*** Thanks for all the questions, everyone. We're signing off for now but will check back throughout the day to answer some more, so keep them coming. We'll also recap some of the best Q&amp;As from here in our [cybersecurity newsletter](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity) tomorrow.",

But you can dispute a transaction and get your money back. There's really nothing happening online that's comparable to elections, in terms of the stakes. So the inherent vulnerabilities in the internet raise more serious questions for voting than for any other application.\n\n\u2014Eric",

The only machines permitted to count votes in Nebraska, he said, are those made and programmed by the corporation formerly run by Hagel.** \nMatulka shared his news with me, then sighed loud and long on the phone, as if he were watching his children's future evaporate. \n**\"If you want to win the election,\" he finally said, \"just control the machines.\"** \n\nhttps://www.thomhartmann.com/articles/2003/01/if-you-want-win-election-just-control-voting-machines",

Trivially easy, actually. The problem is distribution. You need the keys (accounts) to not be traceable to any individual. What that means is that I give you your key with one Votecoin attached. But if you lose it, it's gone. There's no way for me to cancel your old key, because I don't know which one it is.\n\nIt's like if we just mailed out ballots to every registered voter 6 weeks in advance. Lost in the mail? Break in? Too bad. No ballot, no vote. Two ballots, two votes.\n\nThen there's the issue of actually voting. The blockchain itself is secure as hell. Software interfacing with it, not so much. At some point, unless you want to do the math by hand, you're going to have to enter your secret key into some computer somewhere. That software is a point of exposure.\n\nA more secure crypto voting system, in my mind:\n\nI go to a terminal and enter my vote. I also type in a secret phrase, like \"ILIKEFISHSTICKS\" or \"spsjcjns95;\". That terminal submits my vote. It prints a slip for me that says\n\n1. How I voted\n\n2. How I voted, encrypted by the polling station's private key (garbled text, but can be decoded by anyone)\n\n3. What my secret phrase was\n\n4. What my public key is (QR code)\n\n5. What my private key is (QR code)\n\nThen everyone gets to see the list of votes. In the list is:\n\na) How the person voted\n\nb) What their public key is\n\nc) Their secret phrase, encrypted by their public key\n\nThat means:\n\n* I, and only I, can figure out which vote in the list is mine, because only I know my public key (this is a bit weird but not unheard of)\n\n* I know no one else has the same vote in the list, because I can check the secret phrase. Only I know my private key, so only I can check it.\n\n* If my vote is wrong, I can prove it, since the only way I can get (2) is if it comes from the polling station.\n\nIt's vulnerable to fake votes, but that's true of ballot boxes as well. And it has the ability for me to look and see if my vote was counted while remaining anonymous.",

I'm not gonna pretend to know exactly what type of security risks we're worried about here or what type of scheme would be required to defend against that, but is it really impossible? I feel like if we gave the NSA or some equivalent entity unlimited resources to secure paperless voting machines, that it could be done. Am I wrong about this? Obviously it may not be feasible to do so, I'm just kinda wondering from a theoretical standpoint.

That's an attack surface that only needs one corrupt tech staff to exploit.\n\nRight now some counties in the US are doing \"internet voting\" of sorts - they pass precinct-level data to the county over VPNs and cellular modems.  So what happens if one county election staffer gives the VPN password to their good buddy at the Russian embassy?  That county is pwned.\n\nSaying \"one county\" makes it sounds harmless but think about how many states are dominated by the politics is just one county?

You don't get a ballot unless you prove your identity.  Once proven, you don't get a second ballot unless you return the one you've already received.\n\nThe physical number of ballots is also controlled so security revolves around the physical security of the ballots and the screening of voters.  The ballots themselves can be audited, but not attributed to any 1 voter which preserves the anonymity of the process while retaining the credibility.  The only routes for attack are physical manipulation of the ballots or breach in voter records/identity.\n\nWith electronic voting, there are no physical ballots to secure.  Instead, it's electronic and all that does is increase the number of attack vectors on the electronic ballots while reducing the credibility of the process.  Going online adds vectors for compromising voter identity.",

It is huge, made of many subsystems.\n\nI'm not an expert yet I find you exaggerated when you said the system have major problems. The attack you mentioned was fixed, and it needs to be said that such attack would be quite hard to be made. Also, the voting system is not connected to networks. At the end of the vote the score of all candidates on that ballot box is printed out and can be compared to the tallied results made available later. There was an app by professor Aranha made for the purpose of public auditing, but I think it's discontinued.\n\nAnother team found a way to connect a device and write something onto the voting screen. So far, nothing terribly useful for hackers.\n\nI believe a coordinated attack perpetrated by the parties preparing the machine would have more chance of success. Components are signed but I'm not sure if strong enough security is used. The higher the stakes (executive) the higher the viability/cost of coordination.",

Polling locations also have drop off spots two weeks before election day and the day of election if you vote in person they literally just print you out a paper ballot with that same tear off tab. They have a digital way to fill out the ballots if you prefer but the counting is not done by those machines it's simply for printing a filled out ballot. It's so much easier than New York where I used to live and voting participation in Colorado is some of the highest in the country.",

Basically, you have people inspect a random sample of the paper ballots, and you use math to make sure the sample is large enough so that the chance that the audit would miss outcome-changing fraud is less than a pre-specified probability (the \"risk limit\").\n\nHow big a sample you need to audit depends on how close the election result appears to be.  Intuitively, if the computers say the race was a landslide, you only need to inspect a very small number of paper ballots to confirm it really was a landslide (maybe just a few hundred across the whole state), but if the outcome was a tie, you need to inspect every ballot to make sure.  An RLA adapts the sample size to ensure that you already get to a high level of confidence, regardless of how close the outcome was.\n\nOther states have recently passed RLA legislation, including Rhode Island and Virginia, and many counties across the country are piloting RLAs, but it's going to take a lot of work to get every state to run them.\n\n \u2014Alex",

They could cross another party and nullify their vote, they could not put a ballot, but what they cannot do is give a valid vote for any other party.",

You still have the problem of \"choosing\" which one to go with.\n\n\nAnd in reality all dual systems like that do is make everything massively more complex, more expensive, and more time consuming. Not to mention the machines break which causes long voting lines and disenfranchised voters, it makes it hard for the disabled and elderly to vote in many cases, and it removes the ability for an individual person to verify and tally their own vote.\n\n\nIt's adding complexity and removing protections and layers of security, and I genuinely can't figure out why. There's no benefit to electronic voting. It's not easier, it's not cheaper, it's not faster (when you verify against the paper trail), it introduces more weaknesses (you press \"I vote for Flarg McNewton\", and it prints out \"I voted for Dude McManperson\", and now what do you do? Do the polling place runners know how to \"undo\" a vote? Would they be able to undo anyones vote?). It is just worse in every single way, and I really don't understand why so many people want it.",

You can read our research paper and see a video of our findings here: [https://indiaevm.org](https://indiaevm.org/)\n\nWith just a few minutes of physical access, an attacker can tamper with the machines to change the votes stored in them, or to make the machines count future elections dishonestly.  We built low-cost hardware devices to carry out both attacks.\n\nAs a result of our research, India has recently rolled out a voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT), which could help detect such attackers.  Unfortunately, I understand that there are some major unresolved problems with the implementation.  First among them, the audits aren't risk-limiting, so in a close election, they might not be thorough enough to detect outcome-changing fraud.\n\n\u2014Alex",

Every county votes on paper, but you showed me last year that even the tabulators are susceptible. I was lucky enough to be in the audience during your talk at DEF CON. \n\nES&amp;S seems to have at least a decent system in place for delivering and handling election definition USB sticks. What's the real risk of tabulators being hacked? Is there an easy way to check what vulnerabilities exist by firmware version? Do you have any recommendations on securing paper ballot states?",

ES&amp;S is a good illustration of the risk: they create the ballot programming for 2000 jurisdictions across 34 states from their corporate headquarters, which is a much more centralized point of attack that most people are aware exists.\n\nOne important defense is to make sure you have the latest firmware.  But voting machine firmware tends to be years out of date, because there's a lengthy certification process.  For instance, the latest certified ES&amp;S software still relies on Windows 7, which will soon be unsupported by Microsoft.\n\nIncredibly, most states do not even require that jurisdictions use the newest available firmware.  For example, Georgia currently uses paperless DREs across the state with firmware that hasn't been updated since 2005.\n\nThe strongest and most important defense is to rigorously audit the paper trail, through manual risk-limiting audits.  Even if the machines are somehow hacked, such audits ensure that there's only a small statistical chance that any outcome-altering fraud will go undetected.  That creates a powerful deterrent, and if an attack happens anyway, you can correct it by recounting the paper.\n\n \u2014Alex",

That means that any error or hack affecting the outcome can be detected.  One way to do this is to use paper ballots with optical scanners and manual risk-limiting audits, so you get two independent records of every vote that would need to be separately hacked to change the results without detection.\n\nThat's way stronger than either hand-counted voting or unaudited computer voting alone.\n\n\u2014Alex",

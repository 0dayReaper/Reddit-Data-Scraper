    "postText": "Update: reddit hug of death, try the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skiplagged) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skiplagged-actually-cheap/id823443083) apps if website fails &lt;3 . We're also hiring, particularly engineers to make Skiplagged better. Email apply@skiplagged.com if you're interested.\n\nThis is a followup to the [AMA I did last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2o831k/i_run_skiplagged_a_site_being_sued_by_united/), just after the federal lawsuit was filed.\n\nHey guys, I founded [Skiplagged](https://skiplagged.com). Skiplagged is like a regular airfare search engine except it also shows you fares other websites don't. Among those is something very controversial known as hidden-city. \n\nBasically, hidden-city is where your destination is a stopover; you'd simply leave the airport when you arrive at your destination. It turns out booking this way can save you hundreds of dollars on over 25% of common routes, especially in the USA. [New York to San Francisco example](http://i.imgur.com/Np06G1j.jpg). There are a few caveats, of course: (1) you'd have to book a round-trip as two one-ways (which Skiplagged handles automatically), (2) you can only have carry-ons, and (3) you may be breaking an agreement with the airlines known as contract of carriage, where it might say you can't miss flights on purpose.\n\nWhile Skiplagged is aimed at being a traveller's best friend and does more than inform about hidden-city opportunities, hidden-city is what it became known for. In fact, many people even refer to missing flights on purpose as \"skiplagging\". United Airlines didn't like any of this. \n\nAround September of last year, United reached out trying to get me to stop. I refused to comply because of their sheer arrogance and deceitfulness. For example, United tried to use the contract of carriage. They insisted Skiplagged, a site that provides information, was violating the contract. Contract of carriage is an agreement between passengers and airlines...Skiplagged is neither. This was basically the case of a big corporation trying to get what they want, irrelevant of the laws.\n\nFast-forward two months to Nov 2014, United teamed up with another big corporation and filed a federal lawsuit. I actually found out I was being sued from a Bloomberg reporter, who reached out asking for my thoughts. As a 22 year old being told there's a federal lawsuit against me by multi-billion dollar corporations, my heart immediately sank. But then I remembered, I'm 22. At worst, I'll be bankrupt. In my gut, I believed educating consumers is good for society so I decided this was a fight worth having. They sent over a letter shortly asking me to capitulate. I refused.\n\nSkiplagged was a self-funded side project so I had no idea how I was going to fund a litigation. To start somewhere, I created a GoFundMe page for people to join me in the fight. What was happening in the following weeks was amazing. First there was coverage from small news websites. Then cbs reached out asking me to be [on national tv](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/finding-cheap-airfare-made-easier-with-skiplagged-startup/). Then cnn reached out and [published an article](http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/29/news/united-orbitz-sue-skiplagged-22/). Overnight, my story started going viral worldwide like frontpage of reddit and trending on facebook. Then I was asked to go on more national tv, local tv, radio stations, etc. Newspapers all over the world started picking this up. United caused the streisand effect. Tens of millions of people now heard about what they're doing. This was so nerve-wracking! Luckily, people understood what I was doing and there was support from all directions. \n\nFast-forward a couple of months, United's partner in the lawsuit dropped. Fast-forward a few more months to May 2015, a federal judge dropped the lawsuit completely. Victory? Sort of I guess. While now there's no lawsuit against Skiplagged, this is America so corporations like United can try again.\n\nFrom running a business as an early twenties guy to being on national tv to getting sued by multi-billion dollar corporations to successfully crowdfunding, I managed to experience quite a bit. Given the support reddit had for me last year, I wanted to do this AMA to share my experience as a way of giving back to the community. \n\n**Also, I need your help.** \n\nThe crowdfunding to fight the lawsuit led to donations of over $80,000. I promised to donate the excess, so in addition to your question feel free to suggest what charity Skiplagged should support with the remaining ~$23,000.

But Hipaa has loopholes, open windows, and back doors. Hipaa isn't as much iron clad protection from people asking your doctors questions, it just means they need to have some form of cursory information on you to get more Information. You'd be surprised how little information you need to have in order to get a lot more information.\n\n For instance, if you call the doctor and say \"I am so-and -so's wife. His birthday is 12/25/1975. We live on Houston Ave, in NYC, NY. Can you tell me if he has an upcoming appointment?\" Guess what? You'll find out real quick whether or not they have an upcoming appointment. Because here's the thing about Hippa: **it doesn't require the doctor or doctor's office to confirm the identity of the person they are speaking to.** You literally only need a name, a birthdate, and an address. If you have that information, you're good.  An unscrupulous airline employee would certainly be able to access that information with your airline reservation. \n\nSo, yeah, Hipaa isn't as iron clad as many believe. \n\nEdit: my stupid phone keeps autocorrecting Hipaa to Hippa. Wtf Apple? What the fuck is Hippa? ",

They won't black ball you after one event, but if they can prove a pattern, they will. The first course of action is to take away your status and/or miles. Black balling happens after repeated incidents. The \"horrible PR\" bit comes up occasionally, and all the airline has to do is show you broke the stated terms of service, end of story. It's not terribly damaging when the facts are laid out. Moreover, the target audience for this \"trick\" are not frequent flyers, or people purchasing non-refundable and biz/first tickets. They're generally not airline loyal, infrequent, cheapest fare flyers. In airline terms, they're seat fillers who are only marginally profitable, if at all, and therefore expendable. \n\nThe ethics of taking advantage of \"skiplagging\" and alternatively, the airline pricing model are for you to decide. Just make sure you are fully aware of the ramifications. Most importantly, only do this on the FINAL leg of your itinerary. Skipping one leg will automatically cancel any remaining legs.",

But there aren't enough people going NYC -&gt; SEA to make it a direct flight. Or, if there is a direct flight, people prefer direct flights to flights with stopovers, so they'd charge more for the direct flight, so they still need to have a stopover flight.\n\nAnd if you're going to have a stopover, it makes sense to have hub cities. This is just basic network theory -- if you have N cities and you can only do direct flights, you would need at least N^2 direct flights every day to cover all of them. If you instead have one massive hub city, then you only need 2N flights every day -- one taking people from everywhere else to the hub, one taking people from the hub to everywhere else.\n\nReality ends up somewhere in the middle, because you still want some direct flights, and population is clustered on the coasts so you want at least one hub on each coast, and not everyone going NYC -&gt; SFO fits on one plane so you need a bunch of flights, and so on, but hopefully you get the idea.\n\nIf you're going to have some small number of hubs like this, it makes sense to put them in big cities that are popular destinations. You can offer more direct flights, because every flight from NYC -&gt; SFO -&gt; SEA can carry some people who just bought a direct NYC -&gt; SFO ticket. The big cities have more of the infrastructure you need to run an airport, including just more people to hire.\n\nEvery part of this makes sense. It's just the whole that's absurd, where NYC -&gt; SFO -&gt; SEA is cheaper than NYC -&gt; SFO, even though the latter is strictly less work for the airline.\n\nSo why do they care? Simple: You're getting a more expensive trip for cheaper. Every person who does this instead of booking NYC -&gt; SFO costs them $130.\n\nBut it's worse than that -- if everybody did this, they would have to change the pricing scheme so the NYC -&gt; SFO -&gt; SEA trip really is more expensive. But this would result in selling fewer tickets, so they'd have to raise prices to compensate. They can't just lower prices and hope to sell more tickets, because they've presumably already priced this at what the market will bear -- they might get more people flying NYC -&gt; SFO if it cost less than $170 than if it cost $300, but it wouldn't be enough more people to make up the difference.",

They're still technically in the process of cutting over to Continential's systems and procedures.  Outside of changing flight routes to keep up with the Joneses (American, Delta or Southwest), they don't really move all that swiftly.\n\nBesides, they and most of the other mainline carriers are heavily invested in the hub and spoke system and changing that would require a complete overhaul in the way they operate.",

I showed up for an international flight to Mexico 2 hours before departure at 5:15am. The airport was empty...except for the handful of people waiting for early AM international flights. There was no one in the security line, it was a 7 minute walk to the gate. There was only one counter agent working so everyone was trying to use the automated terminals...which weren't working properly causing a huge delay for everyone checking in. By the time I got to the terminal to put my information in I encountered the same errors as everyone else requiring me to manually input my passport information 3 or 4 times. It was now 58 minutes before departure. The terminal rejected my request because American Airlines policy said \"international flights must be checked in an hour before departure\". Now...I had checked in online the night before, but policy required a \"check in\" when you arrived at the airport to get your boarding pass. No big deal, I'll just talk to the counter agent, right? Nope...I spent the next 40 minutes arguing with the counter agent, then her supervisor, then a manager. All they had to do was press a couple of buttons to print my boarding pass so I could walk through the non-existent security line and board the plane. None of them wanted to make the effort and I finally caused enough of a scene that security came over which brought another manager who...pressed a couple of buttons and gave me my boarding pass. Which I now had to get over to security, be the asshole to try and cut in line because I was \"late\" and run to make it to the gate on time. Logic and common sense don't get factored into American Airlines staff.",

She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.\"",

Those people gave you those donations to ensure that you survive, so let's be sure you do :)\n\nAlso, just a word of warning for those using the site to fly internationally -- often it might make sense to book a trip to somewhere like Russia for cheap, and then plan to get off at your stopover city in Europe or wherever.  However, if the end destination country (that you never really intended on visiting) requires a visa (that you have no intention of actually getting), the airline could request proof and not let you on the plane.  I almost just did this on a flight from JFK to Geneva and thankfully someone pointed it out to me before I pulled the trigger.",

Also you are going to be late for whatever you were going to, or on the way back, late to get home (potentially missing work, costing you more money).  On top of all that, you are going to be pissed and the airline is going to be pissed because they know what you did at that point.  In the case where you are trying to move not just you, but you and your SO or children, things can get increasingly complicated and expensive should things go wrong.\n\nIf it works, great.

To use the example, there might be lots of airlines going from Los Angeles to Nashville. United has a hub in Denver and so you would connect in Denver; Delta flies through Atlanta, etc. Because it takes two hops on any airline to get from LA to Nashville, there are lots of competitors, and that drives prices down.\n\nBut if you want to go from LA to Denver on Delta, you might have to fly to Detroit first and then fly back to Denver, which would take all day. It might even take three hops. But on United, you can do it nonstop, and so they can charge a premium, because most people would prefer one 2.5 hour flight to two flights that take 6 hours. In fact, if United has the only nonstop, they might be able to charge so large a premium that it's more expensive to fly to Denver than to fly farther to Nashville.\n\nEdit: Deleted an extra word.",

Not as many people want to go to Nashville, and not as many want to deal with a layover, so it's cheaper.\n\nEdit: That is a pretty Eli5 answer, but I'll continue it with more description. Consider LA to Denver -- [1,061 miles](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=distance%20from%20la%20to%20denver). vs LA to Nashville -- [2,003 miles](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=distance+from+la+to+nashville). So, assuming a linear relationship, the flight from LA to Nashville should be twice as expensive. (Not necessarily the case, but reasonable for this thought experiment). \n\nUse Nashville as our base. $500. Now, see, this is the issue. Would you rather fly to Denver, and get super baked on an extra $250 (LA-&gt;Denver = 500/2=250) worth of pot, or fly to Nashville? Now there'll be some people who say, \"Yes, I do.\" Maybe someone's relative died or someone is into Nascar. But by and large - there's more people wanting to go to Denver.\n\nWell, now you're the airline, and you have a problem. You have a huge line of people ready to pay $250 to go to Denver, and a small line of people ready to pay $500 for Nashville. So, what do you do? Like any good capitalist, you increase the price to Denver to start a bidding war. $250? Okay, what about $260! Now you can see - we're increasing Denver's cost while Nashville stays the same because we can. So now we hit some point -- and because I suck at constructing examples, people go crazy until we just barely fill the plane at a cost of $550 per person! \n\nNow we have all these people who decided \"eh, weed isn't worth that much to me\" and decide \"I'd love to see some people drive in circles!\" But they were the same people who weren't willing to spend $550 to go to Denver (really, a range of people between $250 -&gt; $550 are in this group who dropped out). So we decrease the cost on our Nashville flight. Sure, we might be taking a hit financially, but our plane was empty. Might as well fill the seats up. So we almost do. To about $400 and our plane is 2/3rds filled. Well, turns out those pot heads actually like staring into repetitive motions, and there's this untapped potential of people in Denver who also want to join our flight to NSH. They've spent a bunch of their money on pot already though, and now we're going to inconvenience those people who just paid $400 for a direct, so we land the plane in Denver and drop our prices to $300 to make up for the problem plus get the potheads to join us on our trip to Nascar.\n\nNow what started as $250 for LA-&gt;Denver and $500 for LA-&gt;NSH became $550 for LA-&gt;Denver and $300 for LA-&gt;Denver-&gt;Nashville.

                            "comment": "Sounds strange, but I've booked a couple super cheap last minute flights in the last 6 months.  I booked flights from ORD-DFW for $98 on AA less than 24 hours from departure and from ORD-BOS for $107 on United 4 days from departure.  \n\nFor shits and giggles, I looked up those same flights 2 months out (same day of the week, same time, same flight number, not on or near a holiday) and they were both well over double.  \n\nThere are so many variables that go into flight pricing that, as he said, the prices change every few minutes.  \n\nMy best advice is:\n\n* **Know what you're willing to spend and book a flight if it falls in that window.**  \n\n* **Use a private browsing window.**  I've heard a ton of debate on this one; some say airlines can track your IP/cookies to see if you've looked for the same fares in the past and will artificially inflate the price to make you think the price is going up and that you should *book now*.  Anecdotal experience(take it with a grain of salt): more than one time I looked for a flight in a normal browsing window for the 3rd time and it was $157 and when I opened an incognito tab it was $107, the price I was quoted the first time I looked.  \n\n* **Have flexible dates**.  Some pricing rules will give you a significantly discounted fare if your trip starts and ends outside of a weekend, among other conditions.  \n\n* **Use Kayak/Travelocity/Orbitz to look for your flights,** ***but book on the airline's website.***  The prices are almost always exactly the same, but the airline pays a cut to the aggregator which makes them way less likely to work with you if you have issues in the future.  This also applies to hotels.  The only time I'd recommend using an aggregator like hotels.com to book stays is if you get a significant amount of rewards.  I've booked through them and legitimately been told at the front desk of a nice hotel that there's nothing they can do because I didn't book directly through them.  ",

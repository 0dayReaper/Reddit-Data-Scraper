If you are interested in learning more about my work please follow me on Twitter @garjoh_canuck, on LinkedIn, or visit my website for links to my research https://www.garjoh.com. \n\n*********************************\n\nI\u2019m Garrett Johnson, an Assistant Professor of Marketing at Boston University's Questrom School of Business. My research on Internet marketing examines online display advertising: the medium\u2019s effectiveness and privacy issues. My ad effectiveness research uses large-scale experiments to measure how and how much ads work. My privacy research quantifies the value of online behavioral targeting to industry and considers the impact of policy &amp;amp; self-regulatory approaches. I work with Internet companies\u2014including Google and Yahoo!\u2014to answer these questions with Internet-scale data.\n\nAsk me anything about:\n- Why and how exactly do ads track you online? \n- What are browser cookies? How are they used?\n- How effective are online display ads?\n- Why and how should you run experiments to measure the effects of online ads? \n- What is the economic impact of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)? \n- What is the future of online advertising without browser cookies? \n- What was the impact of the 2020 YouTube settlement (i.e., the \"COPPAcalypse\") on made-for-\nkids content?\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/o07cIUe)!",

See my response to u/kg_from_ct as well. \n\nThis allows the website to do simple things like personalize the site to you and to gather analytics data (e.g., Google Analytics) about how you and other users use the site in order to improve the site in the future. These identifiers critically allow the online ad tech industry to personalize ads to you--potentially based on your interests inferred from your past browsing--and to measure the effects of those ads by recognizing who sees ads and eventually buy stuff. \n\nSome people are especially concerned that this information violates their privacy and laws (namely Europe's GDPR) now require user consent, which is why you see these pop-ups on sites. \n\nSo, when you click \"Reject All\", you are improving your privacy. The challenge however, is that websites, make less money from ads when you do so. Our research estimated that ads make 52% less money in this case: [http://ssrn.com/abstract=3020503](http://ssrn.com/abstract=3020503). This is in line what most others have found, but estimates vary as I summarize here: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1juu6UBguR7ru1Rhfyor9knFBFsyLNP6FmIiXcJKyJZM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1juu6UBguR7ru1Rhfyor9knFBFsyLNP6FmIiXcJKyJZM/edit?usp=sharing). \n\nFor each individual that opts out, these are only pennies lost, but these pennies add up for publishers who are often providing content for free. This is one reason why we see more paywalls as we browse the internet: publishers are looking to subscriptions to make up for less ad revenue.",

So, when you add a product to your shopping cart, you wouldn't be able to see that product when you click on the cart. \n\nThird-party cookies are more controversial from a privacy perspective because they allow another website (not the one you are on) install a cookie on your browser. That other website can then track you across websites (that allow that site's third party cookie). This helps advertisers for instance know that which users have seen an ad and then later go on to buy something from their website.

I always ask my students whether they use ad blockers and the vast majority of hands go up. I then remind them that they are taking \"Digital Marketing\" and may want to see what other marketers are up to ;) \n\nThe funny thing about ad blockers is that economists and marketers think that they probably increase ad effectiveness! Most ad blockers prevent ads from being sold, so that advertisers are typically not charged for these ad impressions---this also means publishers aren't paid. However, we think that the remaining Internet users are more open to ads (because they could instead block ads if they chose). Simon Anderson and Joshua S. Gans have related research: see e.g., [https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.3.4.1](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.3.4.1). \n\nOne of my favorite papers on ad blocking describes the vicious circle that it creates whereby sites get less money, so produce less content, then attract fewer users, and thereby get less money: \"The effect of ad blocking on website traffic and quality\" by Benjamin Shiller and Joel Waldfogel and Johnny Ryan in The RAND Journal of Economics.",

Obviously, they are doing this because they are generating enough ad revenue to make this work. \n\nI teach search engine optimization (SEO) in my digital marketing class. This is the study of how sites can rank higher in site rankings. The trick to doing this is a combination of delivering value to users with great content for humans while at the same time being mindful of the bots that are visiting your site and scoring it with their algorithms. The trend now for over a decade in SEO is that search engine algorithms have gotten better and better at evaluating content like a human would. In this sense, it's a little surprising that you are encountering a lot of spammy sites. \n\nUnfortunately, I worry that advances in generative AI are going to make this worse as these technologies have dramatically reduced the cost of creating good (not always great) content. \n\nOn the advertiser side, this is one excellent reason to use a \"green light list\" of approved sites that you want to advertise on. This ensures that your ads are seen on quality publishers' sites and that you ad dollars aren't funding these spam factories!",

In particular, we find greater reductions in traffic from personalized ad sources (email and display ads) that we think are indicative of a real harm to websites. Paper and explanatory twitter thread here: [https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3421731](https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3421731), [https://twitter.com/garjoh\\_canuck/status/1397629091315134468?s=20](https://twitter.com/garjoh_canuck/status/1397629091315134468?s=20). \n\n\\- We show that sites cut back on their use of web vendors (e.g. ad tech) post-GDPR. This reduction is short-lived, but seems relatively hit smaller vendors the most, which we worry is bad for competition. Paper and explanatory twitter thread here: [https://ssrn.com/abstract=3477686](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3477686), [https://twitter.com/garjoh\\_canuck/status/1349799939535237121](https://twitter.com/garjoh_canuck/status/1349799939535237121) . \n\n\\- Other research by Lefrere and coauthors did not find an impact of the GDPR on websites content provision, probably because compliance was pretty weak: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=4239013](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4239013) \n\n\\- One paper looked at a panel of users over time and found that users appeared to engage in more search activity online after the GDPR, potentially because they were getting less personalized information via advertising. See Zhao, Yildirim &amp; Chuntagunta's \"Privacy Regulations and Online Search Friction: Evidence from GDPR\"\n\nI have a review paper summarizing the economic impact of the GDPR: [http://ssrn.com/abstract=4290849](http://ssrn.com/abstract=4290849), [https://twitter.com/garjoh\\_canuck/status/1623512102580154368](https://twitter.com/garjoh_canuck/status/1623512102580154368) .

This is a big important question.  \nIn essence, Google has proposed a large list of replacement technologies for the third-party cookies under the banner of Chrome's \"Privacy Sanbbox.\" Cookies are basically a magic-bullet solution right now that helps advertisers to target, measure, and optimize their ad campaigns. Without cookies, Google has proposed separate technologies for each of these use cases: targeting (Topics API, Protected Audience API), measurement (Attribution Reporting API), and anti-fraud (Private State Tokens API).   \nThese technologies are really ambitious because they propose to rearchitect how digital advertising works in order to better protect user privacy. I created short explainers below:   \n\\- Topics API: [https://twitter.com/garjoh\\_canuck/status/1486438310335721474](https://twitter.com/garjoh_canuck/status/1486438310335721474)    \n\\- Protected Audience API (formerly known as FLEDGE): [https://twitter.com/garjoh\\_canuck/status/1415064817799417858](https://twitter.com/garjoh_canuck/status/1415064817799417858)   \nYou can learn more about Privacy Sandbox and its timeline here: [https://privacysandbox.com/](https://privacysandbox.com/) . Google is moving from testing this on a small fraction of Chrome users to making this generally available now, which is why you recently got that message in Chrome.   \nYou ask very important questions about the implications of all of this. Some thoughts:   \n\\- Privacy Sandbox intends to make it very difficult for information to be shared across websites in ways that are typical today using third-party cookies. So, the point is to improve privacy by curbing user tracking.   \n\\- The British competition authority is closely monitoring and evaluating the Privacy Sandbox, in part so that this does not unduly hurt competition. They have engaged me as their outside expert for this task, so I can\u2019t say much about this, just that we will be learning a lot about how Privacy Sandbox works over the coming 1-2 years.   \n\\- Privacy Sandbox maintains personalized ads, because personalized ads delivers significantly greater ad revenue that funds the open web. It will be interesting to see how relevant or irrelevant ads become under these new technologies as a function of how they work.",

Website analytics is such an important ingredient to understanding data flows in modern digital advertising. This year I transitioned to the GA4 training now that Google is sunsetting universal analytics. GA4 adapts to the more privacy-centric reality of modern marketing, so is \"future proof\" in that sense. \n\nIn the past, I've had my students do Hootsuite Academy, which provides a great introduction to social media management using popular (and Canadian like me!) software. \n\nI haven't done other certifications myself, but students have told me that Google Ads training and Hubspot trainings are useful as well. \n\nThis would be a great opportunity for others in the space to weigh in on recommendations below :)",

Certainly, tools are available for users to block ads, block tracking (e.g., Firefox &amp; Safari), and even block cookie consent pop-ups. \n\nI am a little more sympathetic to the predicament that websites face. If you reject all cookies, then our research predicts that websites will earn 52% less money from advertising to you: [http://ssrn.com/abstract=3020503](http://ssrn.com/abstract=3020503), [https://twitter.com/garjoh\\_canuck/status/1117874397191163904](https://twitter.com/garjoh_canuck/status/1117874397191163904). So, I can understand why websites may want users to click a couple of times to opt-out of tracking. However, some extreme website practices can be outright deceptive and many website practices fall short of the GDPR's high bar for consent. \n\nWebsites may be able to function without ads or tracking, but these help to pay the staff (e.g., journalists) that create the content that websites often provide free of charge. Our own recent research on the YouTube COPPA settlement provides evidence that the privacy-for-content tradeoff is real: [https://ssrn.com/abstract=4430334](https://ssrn.com/abstract=4430334), [https://twitter.com/garjoh\\_canuck/status/1651592400643702784](https://twitter.com/garjoh_canuck/status/1651592400643702784) . Shiller, Waldfogel, &amp; Ryan (2018) show that ad blocking hurts websites: i.e., the ads-for-content tradeoff is real. \n\nNevertheless, I understand that not everyone is comfortable with trading off their individual privacy and attention (to ads) to help pay for free content.",

Advertising is no exception! \n\nI am a strong advocate for running experiments to measure the effectiveness of advertising by comparing a random group that is exposed to the focal advertiser's campaign and comparing them to randomized control group that is held out from the campaign. The latter group then allows the advertiser to know how much sales they generate without the ad campaign, so that the advertiser can know the \\*incremental\\* sales generated by the ad exposed group. \n\nI think a really fun and entertaining reading discussing the issue you bring up is the following piece in The Correspondent: [https://thecorrespondent.com/100/the-new-dot-com-bubble-is-here-its-called-online-advertising/109970897300-fd465983](https://thecorrespondent.com/100/the-new-dot-com-bubble-is-here-its-called-online-advertising/109970897300-fd465983). Hope you enjoy it! \n\nFor your second question, you are correct that the \"Big 2\" dominate the industry. After peaking 2017 at 54.7% of the online advertising revenue in the US, the Big 2 fell below 50% of ad spend in 2022 (48.4%).

Putting aside every personal opinion I have on them.  The costs come to the tune of an individual's life savings, a company's data being destroyed irrevocably, or their private data stolen and leaked to the world. The day I pushed out mandatory ad blocking to my contract clients is the day they stopped calling with fake login pages.  The cost for the cleanup and damage control that comes with it when someone does get phished by them alone is worth blocking.  I will never admin a network without an adblocker on every endpoint.  The risk to the companies I manage is an order of magnitude larger than the benefit of seeing advertisements.  It is not worth it in a corporate environment.\n\nI understand the indirect benefits in that ads support the sites and services I use, but they must be served in a way that isn't affecting the content they're providing.  If sites didn't serve my browser code that they haven't vetted because it comes from their ad partner who hasn't vetted them, I'd be mildly annoyed by ads instead actively against them.\n\nThe 3 letter agencies block ads.  https://www.techdirt.com/2021/09/30/cia-nsa-block-ads-network-wide-to-protect-agencies-ron-wyden-says-rest-govt-should-do-same/ In the name of security, not privacy, why shouldn't I?",

Really interesting. \n\nI don't completely agree with the statement about online advertising being socialist (rather then capitalistic). Very interesting point though. It does make sense that richer people spend more money after seeing ads, thus participating more to a website's revenue, which leads to people with less money being able to enjoy 'free' content as well. \n\nMy problem with targeted advertising, however, is that for example people with less money and a lower level of education are more likely to see gambling ads, day trading nonsense, etc. Targeted advertising is capitalistic in the sense that it strives towards maximizing profit. Whatever the consequences may be. That is what makes targeted advertisment (or any targeted algorithm) so capitalistic, in my view. For clothes, that's probably not an issue. But for gambling, money making schemes and politics, that can be a real issue. \n\nWhat do you think about this issue? Would love to hear. Thanks again!",

They point to the volume of vendors that put cookies on your computer, attempt to track your browsing across websites, and share this information between adtech vendors. \n\nI may be in the minority here, but I would say that the risk is quite low. The uses of this information are largely innocuous: personalizing content, personalizing ads, capping repeat ad impressions, measuring ad effectiveness, website analytics. In principle, data that tracks your cross-site browsing is risky, but companies could face a backlash if they snooped around this data or used it to abuse people. Despite large-scale cross-site tracking, I think its hard to point to widespread data abuses beyond the harms of some targeted advertising. For instance, cross-site targeting of vulnerable segments like gamblers or certain health issues could be harmful to the extent that advertisers do this. In my view, the solution would be to crack down on such abuses rather than eliminate personalized ads altogether. \n\nNevertheless, I am sympathetic to the notion that the stakes are high in privacy, because revealing secrets is irreversible. So, recent industry attempts to improve privacy in this industry are laudable (see u/deaneckles's question). \n\nI am more concerned about potential harmful uses of location data like in this story: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/03/09/catholics-gay-priests-grindr-data-bishops/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/03/09/catholics-gay-priests-grindr-data-bishops/).

This includes cookies IDs and IP addresses. Thus, the GDPR doesn't just cover personally identifiable information. \n\nSo, pseudonymizing IP addresses using a one way hash would still constitute personal data and be subject to the GDPR. \n\nThe GDPR is about data protection and it places a number of responsibilities on firms. These includes data pseudonymisation, which is also referred to as data protection by design. Pseudonymisation limits the potential harm in the event of a data breach as the pseudonymized personal data wouldn't be recognizable to hackers.",

(White hat marketing.)\n\nRecently Google's and Facebook's desire to collect customer data at checkout has been bugging me.\n\nGoogle and Facebook now openly demand that more and more personal data is passed back to them when purchases complete. This is a recent development. This data can be used to optimise ad targeting to improve performance of a campaign, so there is considerable pressure on businesses to provide it.\n\nRather than (somewhat) anonymous cookie tracking with a simple notion that a user has converted to a sale, as advertiser's, we are now being asked to pass back not only customer names, addresses and emails but also very specific details about what exactly has been purchased and for how much. All of this under the umbrella of 'First Party' data. Ie that the client website gets inexplicit permission (via website T&amp;C's) from users to share this data with Google and Facebook.\n\nI can't help but feel this goes way beyond what GDPR was designed to limit and yet here we are. I have yet to implement any of these changes with my clients websites as I feel it goes against the spirit of privacy legislation and I don't want to \"drop my clients in it\". But, it puts them at a commercial disadvantage compared to those businesses that do share this data.\n\nMoreover, this methodology also passes very commercially sensitive information back to these platforms ultimately allowing them to collect data about how much profit each business makes. (They ask for margins too!) Margins are being squeezed so much that many clients find advertising loss making and stop doing it.\n\nWhat's your view on this new approach these platforms are taking with respect to user privacy? I feel it's a scandal in the making as I don't think many people are aware that their buying habits are being tracked and recorded so directly and they are not currently given the opportunity to opt out of this data collection as it has nothing to do with cookies and client side tracking.\n\nAm I missing something here or am I right to be concerned? Many thanks.",

I'm not a lawyer, but my strong sense is that EU regulators would take a dim view of this practice unless you have obtained user consent. \n\nThis is a powerful example of the trend in digital marketing to outsource this function to walled gardens like Google and Facebook. Though the individual steps that led us here may have been sensible, I agree it is bizarre to step back and see so many marketers funnelling their customer's data and detailed transaction data to big tech firms.  \n\nAt the same time, I am sympathetic to marketers who opt to share data. This powerful study ([https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176208](https://ssrn.com/abstract=4176208)) highlights that Facebook can decrease the cost of acquiring an incremental customer by 37% on median. The value generated by cross-site/app identity is so great for online advertising, it is not surprising that marketers use work-arounds when some browsers unilaterally crack down on cross-site identity. As I indicate in my twitter thread, \"Life finds a way.\" \n\nSo, eliminating these sort of privacy-invasive practices (if that is the goal) would either require require developing suitable, privacy-centric digital ad alternative technologies  or a regulatory crack-down. However, the latter would harm online sellers and content creators as well as the consumers that depend on them. In the former case, recent developments like Privacy Sandbox (see my response to u/deaneckles), data clean rooms, and the application of secure multi-party computation show some promise. \n\nWe live in interesting times, u/HelloObjective ...",

I take some comfort that others notice and wish to discuss \"The elephant in the room\".\n\nLet me be perfectly clear on one thing: I am a fan of relevant advertising and digital ad technologies. I'd go as far to say that it's crucial to competition and innovation as it (in particular) allows small businesses to reach their niche audiences cost effectively.\n\nMy worst fear is that if things are over regulated users will only ever see gambling ads, insurance and financial services ads and large corporations ads because only those businesses will be able to afford to advertise. (Spray and pray style advertising.) It's like going back to 1950s TV advertising but with a distopian spin akin to Back to the Future 2!\n\nSo methods do need to be found to allow users to get relevant ads without compromising their privacy concerns. I will dig into sandbox tech.\n\nSadly what I am observing is relevancy being discarded in favour of profits and costs rising dramatically (in part due to privacy restrictions), especially for small businesses. Changes at Google and Facebook are making it much harder for small businesses to compete with higher spending competition who have broader offerings. They are being priced out of the market and margins are squeezed to nothing.\n\nWhich brings me to the bigger problem. As advertising platforms get more data about businesses transaction value and profitably they can squeeze as much value as is possible from their clients. This makes perfect business sense for them but will see declining choice for consumers as many businesses will fail to stay in business or stay in business with zero profit. The ability for governments to generate income from corporation tax on profits will be likely be reduced so we should be concerned about this in the UK as much of the tax take comes from small businesses.",

I had no interest in Flamenco type music or anything, but I didn't know anything about music at the time (I was 14 years old) and the guy at the local music shop said it was a good guitar to learn on with its more comfortable nylon strings. In retrospect, it wasn't a bad guitar to learn on but he was probably trying to move some inventory. heh!",

Around 2018, I started in earnest again, and then during the pandemic, I would practice every day for 2 hours on average, which has essentially lasted until today, so I did kind of have to re-learn everything. I also spent time learning music production (recording, mixing, mastering, etc.), which were all pretty new to me. \n\nMusic is really as hard or as easy as you want it to be, so this answer will vary wildly depending on what your goals are so I can only speak for myself, but I hope this helps!",

I'm still learning them each and every time I play. I feel fairly confident that if I played a new instrument 2 hours every day for a year or so, I could pick it up on at least a basic level.",

Udemy, for instances, offers complete courses on learning how to play guitar and they often have sales that make them quite affordable. Beyond that, I would practice scales, look into music theory (which I assume you have a bit of), and practice other people's stuff. From there, you can start improvising and playing your own stuff!",

From there I picked up the bass guitar, which isn't too dissimilar, but it would be a disservice to call them the same thing, for sure. I started playing in local bands, got interested in learning the drums from other drummers, bought a drumset and started practicing daily. I was a drummer in bands for a few years, etc. I've dabbled in piano for a little allthroughout but made it a higher priority to spend time to properly learn it over the past few years. Piano is great as it's connected to Midi, which opens the door for virtually every instrument in the computer.",

I competed on Season 6 of [The Great American Baking Show](https://people.com/food/the-great-american-baking-show-trailer-exclusive/), which is coming out on May 5th on the Roku Channel.\n\nBaking in the Tent for Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith was one of the wildest and best experiences of my life so I thought it could be fun to do an AMA about what it was like to participate in what I think is the most heartwarming of competition TV shows alongside some of the kindest (and most talented) fellow bakers I've had the pleasure to know.\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/PrR6Ah9)!\n\nEDIT: You can now stream the show at https://bit.ly/AmericanBakingShow",

It's really hard to balance both and do them at a very high level consistently.

The pandemic certainly made that easier..lots of free time on my hands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd say that planning (and running) a really good one shot program every day for a week for high energy 9 year olds is more work and perhaps more tiring than baking in the tent, lol. But it's like a sprint vs a marathon, I suppose. The Tent is more like a Sprint, being a camp counselor is more like a marathon.",

GBBO is known for being friendly and cooperative, despite being a competition show. The vibe is noticeably different than most American competition shows. Did you have that same experience on the American version? Was everyone really that nice?\n\nAlso, how much quiet work time did you have? The editing makes it seem like the hosts are always talking to people, but I assume that's just to keep the home audience engaged.",

It was equally surreal being in the Tent, I assure you.\n\nI do believe that this season in particular is trying to get back to its roots in terms of that feeling, and that it'll likely feel more like the British version than other American competition shows. It felt exactly as if I walked onto an episode of GBBO. The hosts, judges, crew, and other bakers are all just..really nice and supportive and friendly. It's honestly weird how well all of us bakers got along and became friends given that we were sort of just thrown together from around the country. I would gladly let whoever picked this cast pick future friends for me again \ud83e\udd23\n\nYou have surprisingly little quiet work time. The hosts or judges aren't at your table the whole time, but you almost always have a camera in your face or a producer asking you to explain what you're doing or why. It is a difficult skill to both bake, and talk about it at the same time. I have a lot more respect now for food/cooking celebrities who do that so smoothly.",

Sometimes people call it fermentation too, though I think technically they refer to different stages of the process. Either way, it describes when you let your dough rest and rise. Since yeast is a living organism, it takes some time to eat the sugars in your bread and emit the gas that makes your dough rise and get nice and fluffy. It is somewhat of an art - things like the ambient temperature, humidity, etc can affect how long it takes to proof bread so you really have to know what to look for beyond just following timing in a recipe.",

They all love baking as much as you do, they do it a lot, and they're pretty exceptional compared to the average home baker. Different people have things they've done more or less of, or personal preferences, or innate talents but really the level of skill and practice is just VERY high. I wouldn't say that I think higher or lower of myself than I did before I got to the tent, but it is pretty incredible to get to talk to and work alongside people who are as deep in the rabbithole of baking as you are, and quite a bit moreso in some areas! We have a very active group chat still going post-filming where we give each other tips and advice and share things we're working on. It's kind of awesome!",

Making an \"entremet\" with 4 or 5 different preparations and freezing it in a domestic fridge in less than 2 hours?\n So is everything done in real time or do you prepare things ahead (like weighting all your ingredients) or are the fridge just for the show and you have professional cooling gear hidden behind?

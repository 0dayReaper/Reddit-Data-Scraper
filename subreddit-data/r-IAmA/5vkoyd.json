    "postText": "Today, Feb. 22, 2017, NASA announced the first known system of seven Earth-size planets around a single star. Three of these planets are firmly located in the habitable zone, the area around the parent star where a rocky planet is most likely to have liquid water.\n\nNASA TRAPPIST-1 News Briefing (recording) http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/100200725\nFor more info about the discovery, visit https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/trappist1/\n\nThis discovery sets a new record for greatest number of habitable-zone planets found around a single star outside our solar system. All of these seven planets could have liquid water \u2013 key to life as we know it \u2013 under the right atmospheric conditions, but the chances are highest with the three in the habitable zone.\n\nAt about 40 light-years (235 trillion miles) from Earth, the system of planets is relatively close to us, in the constellation Aquarius. Because they are located outside of our solar system, these planets are scientifically known as exoplanets.\n\nWe're a group of experts here to answer your questions about the discovery, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, and our search for life beyond Earth. Please post your questions here. We'll be online from 3-5 p.m. EST (noon-2 p.m. PST, 20:00-22:00 UTC), and will sign our answers. Ask us anything! \n\n**UPDATE (5:02 p.m. EST):** That's all the time we have for today. Thanks so much for all your great questions.

The spacecraft has been monitoring the brightness of the star since December 15, 2016 and will continue to do so until March 04, 2017. That's over 70 days of data. Scientists will be able to define the orbital period of the 7th planet. They may also be able to see a turnover (or reversal) in the transit timing variations which will allow scientists to refine the planet mass estimates. Perhaps we'll even find additional transiting planets. The raw data will be placed in the public archive immeiately after the observing campaign finishes. It should be available to community by March 6th. This is one of the many ways that scientists will be studying the TRAPPIST-1 system. - Natalie Batalha, Kepler Project Scientist\n\nhttps://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/raw-data-for-k2-campaign-12-to-be-released-after-downlink.html\n",

Normally they take their time to process their data and release it ~2 months after it is downloaded, but they're making an exception this time. The raw data is going to be immediately made public to everyone (yes even you) as soon as it's downloaded from space sometime around March 5. You can bet there's already several groups out there waiting to pounce on that and planning their analysis strategy.\n\nThe discovery announced today was based on 20 days of observation. Kepler will observe in total for 80 consecutive days. That means the 7th outer planet should have multiple transits and get its period nailed down. And that also means there's plenty of time for even more planets to be discovered. :)\n\nPlus, the 80 more days of observations will help better constrain the \"transit timing variations\" used to estimate the planet masses. **So I would expect by the end of March (April at the very latest) for there to be several papers published constraining the masses and densities of all the planets much better than we have now.**\n\n",

This would produce individual oxygen atoms, which could then combine to form O2 or O3. These species would usually be broken down fairly rapidly, in reactions that involve the photolysis of atmospheric H2O2 and HO2 by near-UV (low energy UV radiation, or the end of the UV spectrum closest to visible light). \n\nAll stars emit both NUV and FUV radiation (in addition to visible, infrared, etc.), and do so in ratios that vary between stars. For planets orbiting stars that emit an unusually high ratio of FUV:NUV, the breakdown of O2 would be slowed while its production would be increased. This could produce an atmosphere with levels of O2, H2O, and CO2 that would appear consistent with the presence of life. \n\nThe second case is more straightforward, and likely to be more of a transient situation (in my non-expert opinion). TiO2 is a photocalayst, capable of performing water oxidation under NUV irradiaton: \n\n&gt; 2 H2O ---&gt; O2 + 4H^+ + 4 e^-\n\nIf a planet exists with shallow water seas or swamps, high levels of crustal TiO2, and abundant electron acceptor species (some chemical species that is able to collect the four electrons produced in the reaction above, which the authors suggest could be provided by volcanism), atmospheric O2 could be produced and actively replenished.\n\n-\n\n[edit: tried to clarify some of the language]",

When planets are close together and their orbits are in a certain spacing, they interact with each other through gravity, causing the timing of their transits to change a little as the planets tug on each other. By measuring this change, we can determine the mass of the planets. By knowing precisely the size and mass of the planets, we can determine their bulk density, and geophysicists can then help us better understand their interiors.\n\nThen next to this, there will most likely be some tidal heating and significant tides on the planets that would be water worlds!\n\nThe constraints on the orbital eccentricity of the planets are a work in progress and the amplitude of the effects described above will depend strongly on those. So let's see! \n\nIt is really just the beginning for the exploration of this system. Spitzer helped us lift the fail on its architecture, now we can initiate its characterization--the venture for the generation to come!\n\nJ.d.W.",

JWST will observe planets transiting their host stars. Transits are when the planet passes between us and its star, and from these transits, we can observe how gases in the planet\u2019s atmosphere interact with starlight passing through the atmosphere.  Unfortunately, this technique doesn\u2019t allow us to see the surfaces of exoplanets. To do that, we\u2019ll need farther future technology that may become available in the coming decades that will allow us to block out the star\u2019s light and observe the planets directly. Examples of these technologies are starlight suppression tools called coronagraphs and starshades. The planets we observe directly with these starlight suppression techniques will not be spatially resolved: they will literally be single points of light, but don\u2019t despair because we can still learn a lot from single points of light! By analyzing the spectrum of colors in these points of light, we can search for signs of interesting gases (like water vapor and gases produced by life called biosignatures), and we can look for temporal changes in the light caused by processes like planetary rotation and seasonal variations. However, the TRAPPIST-1 planets, being so close to their host star, would likely be tricky to directly observe in this way. These starlight suppression technologies fail once you get too close to the star, and so these types of observations would be extremely difficult. Other planetary systems orbiting hotter stars may be detectable with these technologies, though! And on them, we\u2019d be able to search for things like vegetation and other interesting signs of habitability and life. \u2013G.A.",

The uncertainties on the mass measurements are large, but our best guess is that the surface gravity of most of these planets is similar to that on Earth.  One exception is planet f.  It has the same radius as Earth but 68% the mass.  That means the surface gravity will be 68% that of Earth. - Natalie Batalha \n",

Since we do not yet know anything about the planetary atmosphere's, all we can say is how much energy a planet is receiving from the star compared to how much energy Earth receives from the Sun.  However, because this planetary system is so nearby, scientists should be able to characterize the atmospheres with future instruments and observatories.  That's one reason why we're so excited about this discovery.  - Natalie Batalha",

Still, habitable conditions on the planets require them to have magnetic fields to protect the atmospheres from these stellar winds. We don't know if they have. If we detect dense atmospheres, this will make planetary magnetospheres very likely.",

At this level, we discovered in the initial data on exoplanets various \"systematic effects\" having to do with both the telescope and the instrument which made it difficult to achieve this level of performance.  So the re-engineering really meant using the telescope and analyzing the data in new and different ways; this continues as we strive to achieve higher and higher precision. - M.

A high priority gas we of course want to detect is water vapor since water is necessary for life as we know it and is a fundamental part of our definition of planetary habitability. We will need to stare at these targets for a long time with JWST to be able to collect sufficient signal from them for a chance at determining their atmospheric compositions. During transit events (when the planets pass in front of their star), gases in the planets\u2019 atmospheres can absorb starlight, producing potentially detectable signals. These will be very difficult observations, however, and obtaining better constraints on these planets\u2019 properties beforehand (e.g. their masses) can help disentangle the signals we obtain with JWST in the future. -G.A.",

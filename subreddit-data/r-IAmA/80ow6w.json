The benefit of getting these things right would be amazing.\nWith all the talk about inequity it is interesting that we still work on vertical areas like health, education, housing, food, etc.. as separate things rather than having a full view of the challenges someone faces.\n",

I wanted to understand how Quantum computers could factor numbers so much faster than normal computers. It is amazing how the matrix math with complex numbers works - nature is doing arbitrary computation but it is tricky to access. These are early days but yes Microsoft is making large investments in quantum - particularly in handling the error problems that most approaches have.",

The On-Screen Keyboard isn't under heavy development anymore, but all of our efforts are being poured in the Touch Keyboard. To get to it you have to right click the taskbar and set `Show touch keyboard button`. This has some of the features you're looking for like text prediction, multilingual support, shapewriting and accent characters. It does not have a fade option but it is context aware and should re-position the input if it believes that the keyboard is obscuring it.\n\nThere has been lots of great research done on tools similar to Dasher, it would be interesting to see a modern implementation of something similar come on the Windows platform.\n\nWe very much appreciate the feedback and are always looking to make Windows more accessible for all people.  We would love to hear more from you and if you want to reach out and maybe have a skype call if it is easier for you than typing back and forth we would love to to hear from you.  Pm me back\n\nAs a side note: We're also hard at work bringing you [typing with your eyes](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/2/16087368/microsoft-eye-control-windows-10-availability-beta-test )",

For the future we need new tools since resistance is developing to all the current tools. We don't have a vaccine that protects for long enough to help out yet but we are investing heavily in one. We do a lot of modelling to understand which tools would help the most. One that would be new is called gene drive which would reduce mosquito populations for a number of years to make it easier to clear the malaria from all of the humans - this will be ready for field testing in a few years",

You've turned your profound success into opportunities for millions more to succeed.\n\nAs for my question - I completely agree with the stance you and Melinda discussed in your annual letter, where you stress that the onus of owning future change lies in the hands of the greater population. Too often, though, I feel that even though hundreds, thousands, or sometimes millions of people can hold opinions and strive for change, corporations still hold the vast power for change. You touched on it briefly in #7, but how do you convince corporations to look beyond short-term equity growth into the big picture of their role as changemakers within an increasingly border-less world?",

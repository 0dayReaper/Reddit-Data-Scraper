Although many people suffer the most symptoms during the spring and summer, when the trees and grasses pollinate, you can also have a dust mite  or animal dander allergy. This can cause symptoms year round. Dust mites are little microscopic creatures that like to live in very humid environments, like bedding and other upholstery. They are especially in high concentrations when it is humid outside, like during the rainy season or winter. Using the allergen encasements for the pillow and mattress, and washing bedding in hot water weekly can be hugely effective. This may help with your symptoms if you have this allergy.",

Flonase, as you probably already know, is an OTC anti-inflammatory spray. It works well in some people, but works very slowly, often taking 2 weeks or more to have an effect. In many people, it's not enough. I usually recommend adding on a fast acting allergy medicine spray like azelastine or olopatidine in addition to the anti-inflammatory (you can take the sprays back to back). The combination of a very fast acting nasal spray with a slow acting nasal spray is helpful for most people. I usually try and switch people off of fluticasone, since it can be super irritating for some people. I find triamcinolone or budesonide nasal sprays (with are in the same family) are much less irritating.",

Because nasal sprays go right to where the \"action is\", or where the symptoms are occurring, they tend to be much more effective. Most of my patients are able to wean off of oral allergy medications once we find the right nasal spray formula that works for them.\n\nRegarding the injections, the injections that we usually recommend are allergy immunotherapy, or allergy shots.  These, however, are multiple shots that are administered over the course of several years. The once a year shot that you are referring to might be an injectable steroid, which can be riddled with side-effects and can be quite harmful in some people. We usually do not recommend this course of treatment.",

Usually if the food is cooked or processed, they immune system does not recognize the protein in the same way, and they no longer react.

Many people tell me that they do better with the HFA formulations, while others do not notice any significant difference. I would, however, definitely recommend using a spacer with the Ventolin . You can lose significant amounts of medication without a spacer, and you will also probably notice that the medication works  much more effectively.",

It's literally the only thing that has beaten my allergies in Arizona, which make me react like most people do to tear gas. I've gifted it to family members and they've all had the same reaction - total relief.\n\nOkay, I have three questions:\n\n1. I've read about antihistamine poisoning. My prescription nasal spray from you guys has 3 different medicines listed. Is there a risk of poisoning because there are more medicines in the nasal spray?\n\n2. Could someone just take Claritin and Zyrtec with similar results?  \n\n\n3. I don't know how this started, but my family now assumes that any runny nose, watery eyes, or cough are allergies and need an antihistamine, even if the person also clearly has a cold or the flu. My questions are: are all runny noses related to allergies? Are allergies activated by a cold, and therefore solveable by antihistamines? If so, is it dangerous to take antihistamines with cold/flu medicine?",

I am not familiar with antihistamine poisoning, so I cannot comment on that.\n2. In my experience, nasal sprays usually work better for environmental allergies and have less side-effects because they are not absorbed by all parts of the body, like  oral anthistamines are. Because nasal sprays go right to where the \"action is\", or where the symptoms are occurring, they tend to be much more effective. \n3. As you alluded to in your question, not all runny noses are the same. The cause can be different, and can include upper respiratory infections and allergies, depending on the symptoms.",

They help loosen up the mucus so that the mucus stuck in the sinus cavities can come out through the nose instead of back-dripping into the throat. \n\nHowever, if the nose is very swollen on the inside, the saline rinses and neti pot often do not help decrease the swelling on the inside of the nose ( a common symptom in nasal allergies). I usually recommend doing a saline rinse or neti pot first, and then using a combination of an allergy medicine nasal spray (like azelastine or olopatidine) followed by an anti-inflammatory spray (like triamcinolone).

Allermi contains a prescription-only micro-dose of oxymetazoline that is a fraction the dosage of what is in over-the-counter oxymetazoline products such as Afrin. At this tiny dosage, oxymetazoline gently decreases the size of capillaries in the nose, relieving the feeling of congestion and allowing the other medications in your formula better access to the deep reaches of the nasal passages - without the rebound symptoms. We also combine that micro-dose of oxymetazoline with anti-inflammatory medications in the same formula, which even further reduces the risk of rebound. With these two customizations, rebound congestion is not something we see in the 30 years our allergists have been prescribing Allermi formulas.

I found no study that shows microdosing to reduce rebound congestion.\n\nI also believe Oxymetazoline is the reason people initially feel Allermi is so effective compared to other nasal sprays. Afrin is effective as well - imo neither is worth the long-term side-effects and only make sense to use for flare-ups.",

The consensus recommendations on allergy immunotherapy are that they should be administered in the safety of an allergist's office or other clinic under the supervision of a qualified medical doctor.

For 3 years now I've taken immunotherapy pills sublingually, basically compressed grass pollen. Its helped, my symptoms are better. This year I've noticed a reaction to birch pollen, something I was tested for and supposedly didn't have an allergy for. Have I developed an allergy to birch pollen?\n\nAlso for the interesting part. I've been allergic to weed for quite some time. Not diagnosed but its self evident. How am I allergic to something that does not give off pollen (its the female flower I consume, presumably unpollinated)? I don't have to touch it in order to have an allergic reaction. Is weed related to grass in any way, considering its called grass?",

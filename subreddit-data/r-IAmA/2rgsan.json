Has SpaceX looked into Hybrid craft like the SABRE program happening in the UK, or look into the possibility of a space elevator (Even at a thought experiment stage) in the way that Google and NASA have done? \n\nThanks for doing this AMA.

However, you also said that full reusability would be possible for the Mars Colonial Transporter launch vehicle.\n\nWhat have you learned from flights of Falcon 9 that taught you\n\na) that reuse of its second stage won't be possible and \n\nb) what you'll need to do differently with MCT to reuse its second stage.",

For those unfamiliar, in the rocket world, that is a super gigantic difference for stages of roughly equivalent mass ratio (mass full to mass empty).",

If we also have to the plane change for geo missions from Cape inclination (28.5 deg) to equatorial, then a downrange platform landing is needed.\n\n2. The Mars transport system will be a completely new architecture. Am hoping to present that towards the end of this year. Good thing we didn't do it sooner, as we have learned a huge amount from Falcon and Dragon.\n\n3. Our spacesuit design is finally coming together and will also be unveiled later this year. We are putting a lot of effort into design esthetics, not just utility. It needs to both look like a 21st century spacesuit and work well. Really difficult to achieve both.\n\n",

Growing SpaceX's profit margin by a couple orders of magnitude will [be difficult](http://imgur.com/B5vqqfw) due to [low market elasticity](http://i.imgur.com/TMxypBL); you're betting Mars (the fate of the human race) that lowering launch prices will trigger a large increase in demand, allowing SpaceX to grow.\n\n* Given that the only growth and market elasticity seems to be in the small satellite and CubeSat launch industry, why did you cancel Falcon 1 after only 2 successful launches?\n\n* How specifically do you intend to increase SpaceX launch revenue by orders of magnitude?\n\n* Will cheap/reusable launches have a similar profit margin, or will profits/launch fall?\n\n* Is the [SpaceX WorldVu partnership](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2014/11/12/spacex-is-entering-the-micro-satellites-game/) an attempt to grow the satellite industry, or for SpaceX to branch out into a more lucrative industry? (The satellite industry is a ~$200B/year industry)\n\n* What other approaches (by SpaceX or others) might grow the industry by orders of magnitude?",

Could you expand on how you see events playing out between now and then?\n- If you could regulate or deregulate any aspect of the US economy, how would you change the rules to encourage the commercialization of self-driving cars as fast as possible?\n- Will self-driving cars be owned by individuals, or mainly used as shared fleets of robo-taxis?\n\nThanks so much for everything you do!",

He thinks that once batteries reach an energy density of 400 wh/kg, it will be feasible to have a range of 2000-3000 miles.\n\nHe's also talked about making pre-fabricated freeway sections to speed up construction on the 405. (he has to sit through the traffic there almost every day).",

    "postText": "Hello there Reddit, I opened this account just to start this AMA for personal security reasons. With how the situation is progressing, I think that not even the volunteer medics will be spared.\n\nI saw that other post where a protester set up an AMA and thought that maybe I could chime in as well.\n\nI've been at the protests during weekends and holidays since I'm also currently in secondary school. I've witnessed first hand the injuries sustained by the protesters due to their participation in the movement and have been in a few situations where I almost got arrested.\n\nYou can ask me stuff about the injuries I've treated, my background, my opinions about the protests, or what I had for breakfast, anything goes :)\n\nHere's a picture of my EMS vest along with my first aid certification in the cardholder, helmet, goggles, and 3M respirator as proof, let me know if you need more proof and I'll do my best to accommodate!\n\n[https://truepic.com/rql7n74u/](https://truepic.com/rql7n74u/)\n\nI will be answering questions as they keep coming in, so give me all ya got.\n\n\\----------------\n\n**INFORMATION ABOUT HONG KONG PROTESTS + DONATION INFORMATION**\n\nTelegram group for live Hong Kong news updates\nhttps://t.me/hkprotests_reddit\n\n[https://youtu.be/6\\_RdnVtfZPY](https://youtu.be/6_RdnVtfZPY) Hong Kong's Huge Protests Explained\n\n[https://youtu.be/cMkkS\\_pZX1Q](https://youtu.be/cMkkS_pZX1Q) How China is framing the protesters\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PuPr2O2RT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PuPr2O2RT) First aid segment\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rehNF9hz47A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rehNF9hz47A) First aid segment\n\nGoFundMe Link: https://www.gofundme.com/f/fund-medical-supplies-to-hong-kong-volunteer-ems?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet\n(Thanks u/GunGrabbingMemes for setting this up!)\n\n\\-----------------\n\nEDIT: Sorry for the clumsy title, I used the word protest 4 times in the same sentence oops\n\nEDIT 2: I'm gonna go ahead and eat dinner, Ill be back to answering questions in an hour or so (7:42 PM HK time), thanks for all the questions so far guys!\n\nEDIT 3:\n\nA lot of people are asking me how I'm qualified to be a medic at 17. The word medic here is used loosely since Hong Kong people don't really see the term \"medic\" as anything more than \"person who gives medical assistance\" I'm sorry if that miscommunication led to some people thinking that I'm claiming to be a paramedic when I never was. I'm also going to give some details about my medical background as that seems to be an issue with a lot of people.\n\nI am 17, and as soon as I was 13 my mom had started to push me to take medical and first aid related classes because (oh the stereotype) she wanted me to become a doctor. So I got my first aid certificate when I was 13. I gained a lot of interest in emergency medicine and I voluntarily signed up for a lot of different classes relating to medicine by various organizations (ITLS + PHTLS). I had started providing event first aid with a local ambulance organization immediately after I got my first aid cert and started volunteering for the ambulance service when I turned 16. The highest certification I have is emergency medical responder, and I'm planning to get my EMT-B with a private organisation here as soon as I get enough money.\n\nIs this enough qualification to be volunteering on the frontlines? I know a lot of people who have much less than me and a lot of people who have much more experience than me. Which is much like the situation with the protesters, some are there and are only willing to chant or sing, but others are there throwing molotovs and slinging shit at cops. But honestly, we're all just volunteers, and we're all just doing what we can to help the movement in the way that we can the best, and we're all stepping up cause we're all Hong Kongers.\n\n**\u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\uff0c\u53cd\u6297**\n\nEDIT 4:\n\nIf you guys want to donate to our cause these 3 methods are the best way to do it\n\n* Donate directly to frontline medical teams and protesters (PM me and Ill get you in touch)\n* Donate to legal aid organisations such as \u661f\u706b\u806f\u76df (FB Page:  [https://www.facebook.com/sparkalliancehk/](https://www.facebook.com/sparkalliancehk/)  message them and ask for ways to donate)\n* Donate to local press organisations (Hong Kong Free Press, Apple Daily are good choices, Stand News I heard was in danger of running out of funds)\n* Visit r/HongKong and read their pinned post\n\nEDIT 5:\n\nDue to an influx of people commenting and asking questions about HK, u/k0ella, u/Stand_With_HongKong and u/electr9 will be helping me answer some of them :)\n\nEDIT 6: I'll be heading off to take a break now, I'll continue answering later on if I can, I'll be focusing on replying to messages and DMs now :) Thanks for all the questions! If you have any more questions well after this post is published, feel free to PM me and I'll reply",

There was a more notable incident where a protest in Tuen Mun saw mass arrest of first aiders despite them only being there to treat the wounded regardless of their political affiliations.\n\nAs for being attacked or interrupted, there have been an incident where a first aider being arrested had his arm broken by the police while he was on the ground, and another incident where a volunteer first aider was denied access to an MTR station to treat an unconscious man despite begging and pleading and agreeing to be arrested just as long as he is allowed to treat the unconscious guy. It really sucks that we get treated like this.",

Whether it be the Red Cross, MSF or a myriad of other organisations, they are not combatants (and, at least the ones I named, have a ban on carrying any weapons in the perimeter of their facilities) and are to be left completely unharmed and undisturbed while tending to the wounded, no matter what side of the conflict the injured belong to.\n\nA medical sergeant, though still a trained professional and (please correct me if this is wrong) as far as I know vowed to treat any wounded if given the opportunity, whether they are on his side or not, is still a soldier - as such they are allowed to engage and be engaged in combat, whereas disguising a military vehicle as a medical supplier (perhaps to lure in injured opposition or get undetected through enemy lines) is a war crime.\n\nIn practice, this is sometimes not respected (and a breach of the Geneva Convention, as such also a war crime), however troops affiliated with the likes of the UN or a western power are pretty much always respectful of these rules. You won't see a platoon of US soldiers subdue a company of medics/doctors to carry away the wounded they're tending to because they used to fight for the other side.",

Years of economic hardship, much higher prices on popular US goods (especially electronics and tech) and we simply wouldn't have enough of every resource to end trade relations with all countries guilty of Chinese level human rights abuses. Certain minerals rare earth elements and micro chip components are mostly found in China. We'd still have to have some sort of trade relations with human rights abusers, and either hunt for alternative resource locations or develop alternative technology.\n\nTldr: the comfy, affordable Western lifestyle is made possible by dealing with unsavory governments, and the economy is too global and international to expect this to happen any time soon if ever. \n\nNot to mention the fact that the US government and US companies are guilty of crimes against humanity that would shock the average American. If you want to live completely guilt free the only way is to overthrow the global capitalist market, and past history tells us that any country that withdraws from the global market gets bombed or brought to their knees through economic and cultural warfare. We're all cogs in a capitalist machine whether we like it or not.\n\nPast American history tells us that when the entire working class protests for economic reform, we were met with even more brutal tactics than the Chinese used. Our labor history is bloody. Today propaganda, dividing the public and brainwashing have replaced bullets. But that seems to be more effective considering America has completely abandoned attempts to unite the entire working class under one strike, protest or union. Instead we argue with each other over social issues while the rich get richer.",

Even in the most severe protests, the clashes usually occur in a limited area, and is then moved depending on where the protesters decide to go or where the police is coming from. It's not really the city halting, everything destroying, mass disruptions everywhere as a lot of the media is making it out to be. I can go an entire day without realising protests are happening if I were at home and didn't check the news or social media. The impact I suppose comes from a massive decrease in tourism due to Mainland people being scared to come down.",

I've heard lots of reports of insomnia and anxiety amongst the protesters, but I think a bigger issue would be suicides (I'm referring to the suicides that occurred at the start of the movement, and not the suspicious as fuck suicides that cops keep ruling as no foul play) since for a lot of the protesters, especially the younger ones, they're fighting for the future, and seeing China encroach on their freedoms might not do too good for their mental health. \n\nWe've already seen a few suicides happen at the start of the movement that received a lot of attention and rendered them martyrs. This might be used as reasoning for a person who isn't in the best headspace to go ahead and end their lives. Just speculation though, I'm no psychiatrist.",

The extradition bill that kick started this movement was just one of the many instances of growing Chinese extension of control into HK.",

HK young people prob feel like at this rate, they will have no hope of a good life, or political freedom. What's there to lose. \n\nIt is also important to note the economics side. The lives of mainlanders have trended up in the last 20 years, while for many HKers, esp young people without property, like many developed countries, have trended down. CCP contributed a big part of it in HK, at the same time, this fucking over young people is happening globaly. \n\nThe housing problem is like Bay area, but 100 times worse.",

We strike sometimes in responding to specific event, or rally(peaceful) on playground. Notably human chain in the morning. In my school, we shout slogans at the end of recess and lunchtime everyday. Some schools aren\u2019t this lucky, especially those funded by pro-China association. The teachers would call the police to arrest their own students.",

The Anti-Mask Law is possibly the most stupid thing a government has ever done in response to an already escalating social movement. Now it's obvious that Carrie Lam's withdrawal of the Extradition Law Amendment Bill, her promise of a dialogue on an open platform with the people, and her supposed desire to understand the plights of the citizens of Hong Kong were merely tactics to somehow quell the masses before the 70th Anniversary of the PRC on 1st of October.\n\nWe all know that everything is going to escalate, and hopefully then the government will understand that they serve us, and not the other way around.",

Recently it seems they are SPECIFICALLY targeting young skinny girls too.\n\nTwo days ago they stormed a shopping mall (where I live) and arrested a protestor without a proper search warrant. They pushed through the mall doors that were being blocked by the security guards. This is the first time they\u2019ve done this, normally they stay outside.

If you are anti-CCP, then you are damaging the growth of China, and China would continue to be weak and look down by others (which I personally disagree, but that's how some people feel).\n\nThe typical argument for the Tiananmen Square massacre is that because of the \"decisive\" decision and action of the CCP back then, it gave China 30 years of peace and prosperity.",

Many of the volunteer medics only have a first aid cert which I don't think is nearly enough training to be on the frontlines, but with everything that's going on, we'll take what we get. \n\nOn another note, there was a survey done by a protester organisation regarding first aiders in the protest, and they found that around 30% of respondents claimed that they were first aiders who were under the age of 18, which I think is pretty interesting if not worrying.",

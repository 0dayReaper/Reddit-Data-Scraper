You can see some pics here: [http://airbnb.com/h/titanranch](http://airbnb.com/h/titanranch)\n\nNow we are building a Titan II Replica Missile BnB - 103 feet (31 meters) in length and 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter. It's going to be epic! \n\nAMA!",

There\u2019s none of the launch complex aesthetic left other than the general room shape.\n\nPersonally I\u2019d be more excited to stay in such a place if it had the entire 1970s \u201cdesigned and furnished by defense contractor\u201d vibe going. Milspec gray steel, everything attached to shock absorbers, wire guarded fluorescent fixtures on threaded strut mounts. Cable bundles lining the walls down the access corridor. Throw in some austere government spec period furniture with some carefully selected creature comforts added. Maybe some replica equipment racks and launch console components so you can actually tell you\u2019re in a launch control complex.  All the cool factor of a missile installation comes from the functional aspect, not that its a concrete space underground.",

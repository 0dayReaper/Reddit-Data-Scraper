If I missed your question or you have a new question please chat, message, or email me here** [**https://naplab.com/contact/**](https://naplab.com/contact/) **I'm always happy to answer any questions and provide personalized recommendations at any point during the year.** \n\n**Many of you sent email requests for help. Confirming I am receiving them and doing my best to reply to all of those by tomorrow. If you don't get a reply from me by Monday please send in a new request.**\n\n**Thank you for all of the amazing questions, suggestions, feedback, and comments! This AMA was truly the highlight of 2023 for me. \u2764\ufe0f Reddit!**\n\nHi Reddit!\n\nMy name is Derek! I\u2019ve been testing mattresses since 2014 and over the years I\u2019ve tested 268+ different mattresses.\n\nI am the original owner &amp; Founder of Sleepopolis.com, where I operated it from 2014 to 2017.\n\nIn 2021, I launched a new platform at [NapLab.com](https://NapLab.com) to test mattresses. At NapLab I developed a battery of objective &amp; data-driven tests to analyze and score mattresses. [Our testing process](https://naplab.com/how-we-test-mattresses/) includes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Thermal imagery to assess cooling / heat retention\n* Accelerometer to measure motion transfer\n* 5 factor weighted equation to assess sex performance\n* Video / photo analysis to take precise &amp; objective measurements for sinkage, material responsiveness, edge support, and bounce\n* In addition to other data-driven tests\n\nNapLab\u2019s aim is to create the most objective, transparent, and helpful mattress reviews so our readers can make the most informed decision about the mattress that's best for them.\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve convinced the best friends &amp; family I know to come help me bring this vision to life.\n\nHappy to answer any questions about mattresses, sleep, NapLab, the industry, or anything else on your mind \ud83d\ude42\n\n**Proof** \\- [https://i.imgur.com/SgdmVKc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/SgdmVKc.jpg)\n\n**Update 9:15 pm EST** \\- Thanks so much for the amazing AMA &amp; questions, Reddit! I need to step away for few hours to get my kids fed / asleep. I'll be MIA for a while, but I will absolutely be back to answer a few questions late tonight and then again tomorrow. If I somehow missed your question feel free to shoot me a message here - [https://naplab.com/contact/](https://naplab.com/contact/)\n\n**Update 1:11 pm EST** \\- I am back for day #2 of questions, so fire away!",

This presumably led to a drawn out lawsuit, with Casper assuming direct damages due to this box discouraging people from immediately buying. Other mattress reviewers were also involved in lawsuits with Casper, and eventually settled, presumably alongside the agreement to take down any reviews that were too negative. \n\nSleepopolis refused to settle, and eventually their million dollar site was bought out by other, comparatively smaller reviewers, with the financial aid of Casper.\n\nThere's also lots of bribery, sometimes scummy and undeclared financial incentive given to reviewers by these companies to \"ensure a good review.\" Including from Casper itself. No one is unbiased, and there aren't a ton of legalities requiring declaration of conflicts of interest on sites like this, so be a discerning consumer :)",

Then all the mattress producers in the world will buy your equipment to perform the tests. Sure there may eventually be competitors, but being the first mover in the production of an industry standard procedure takes many years for that monopoly to get broken.",

He started his pitch and gave me all this info, and asked what I used at the moment. \n\nI said me and my partner bought a $1200 180x200 bed (king size I guess) a few years back that we\u2019re happy with. He was like \u201d you don\u2019t even get a bed for $1200, imagine all the labor and transport, packaging and overhead costs etc. after $1200 there\u2019s not even any money left for the actual materials, you\u2019re basically sleeping on air, or slave labor.\u201d\n\nSince I wasn\u2019t there to buy and was just curious I asked about their price ranges and what the cheapest one he could recommend was, he said \u201dwell, we have some commercial (aka budget) models in the store.\u201d\n\nI asked what \u201dcommercial\u201d models meant.\n\nHe clarified that they are their cheaper models, with prices below $50 000. He showed me a bed for like $12 000 which was apparently their cheapest model, it was just a mattress on legs, not a continental or anything. The most expensive one they had in the store was $200 000. He went on about the natural materials they use and shit, meaning that cheap beds will be ridden with mite and stuff after 10-15 years and have to be discarded, but a h\u00e4stens bed will be clean after 80-100 years of use!\n\nIt was surreal, he felt so removed from reality.",

The top and bottom parts of the mattress rise, it has nassage vibrations etc., all controlled by a remote. The bed is good but extremely heavy to the point where is almost impossible to move without scratching the floors because of the machinery + heavy mattress, and the remote hasn't worked for a decade. It feels very much like a slightly overdone luxury item, but it's still the only bed she can sleep in without back pain, so it was probably worth it. It's a pain if you ever have to remove even just the top mattress though, since it weighs so much it may give you that back pain right back.",

And even a more reasonable 50% margin means there is a lot of money to be made.\n\n2) The mattress industry is large - in the US there is ~$12 billion in annual mattress sales.\n\n3) Mattresses are relatively easy to manufacturer - there are numerous manufacturers in the US who can quickly and inexpensive build and drop-ship a mattress with your company branding. New brands don't need to build their own factory, often don't need significant warehouse, and don't need much in terms of start up capital. This is contrast to sofas, fridges, or cars, which are all comparatively hard to manufacturer.\n\n4) Consumers don't have access to good information - mattress brands don't generally do a good job at explaining what's in their mattress in a way that's easy to understand and easy to compare from model to model or brand to brand. Instead, there is lots of marketing language that can be hard to decipher. As a result, it's easy for mattress companies to get consumers to spend more than they need.\n\nThere is undoubtedly more to it than that. But these are the 4 major factors that set the stage. When consumers don't have full information as to what they are buying with a market size that's large, lucrative, and easy for new players to enter, you end up with where we are at today.",

You pay a lot of money to be able to adjust the firmness, but once you decide that you like soft or medium or firm (or whatever the number) then you'll never / rarely change it. As a result, it's just so much cheaper to find a mattress that has the firmness you need and not pay for this technology that you'll never / rarely use after the 1st time setting it.\r  \n\r  \nOn softer settings they really struggle. Sleep Number seems to think \"soft\" means \"sinks more\" and \"provides less support\". Every time I've slept on the softer settings I just feel like it's just sagging more in the middle. It's not actually softer. Sleep Number is best when you're in the medium-firm to very firm range. Below that, it's not great.\r  \n\r  \nBecause the support is created by the expandable air bladder you need to sleep right in the middle of the bladder. As you move closer to the edge or middle of the mattress you're lying on the support perimeter foam, which can create a less-than-great feel.\r  \n\r  \nIn my view, there are tons of options that offer better performance for far less money.\n\nAll that said, if you've already tried 3 different mattresses and come up empty then perhaps Sleep Number is a better option for you.",

IE. a mattress with a 6\" foam layer on top of 8\" of coils is going to warmer than a 3\" foam layer on top of 8\" of coils (in most cases).\n\nMattresses that use phase change materials in the cover also provide a notable cooling advantage over covers without these materials.\n\nAs far as what those specific mattresses are:\n\nEight Sleep Pod 3 on top of any high performance hybrid (I love the Pod 3 cover, but Eight Sleep's all foam mattress isn't overly impressive).\n\nSaatva Classic is up there as well as the coil on coil design creates great air flow + it doesn't have as much foam to hold onto heat\n\nBeyond that, there are several high performance hybrids that are all very close. If you go here - https://naplab.com/mattress-comparisons/#cooling - and sort the table by score you can find all the ones with 10/10 easily. Hard to go wrong with any of those.",

They\u2019ve recently forced a subscription model as well to unlock all features. It used to be opt in only but the first year is forced at $180 and only after that can you cancel it. Very stupid marketing. Last, the phone app and unit can be a bit buggy.

The Hybrid combines the material, memory foam, AND traditional coils all at once to create the bed. My partner and I got a California King Hybrid 3 a couple years ago and it's been AMAZING! It's definitely had the best \"weightless\" feel to it of any bed I've owned.",

The primary reason I haven't continued to aggressively test / review them over the years is simply the insane markups on these mattresses. \n\nThe traditional / legacy mattress brands are in an incestous relationship with major retailers. The result is insane markups that severely damage sleepers. Markups on these types of mattresses can easily be 10x. So that $3000 mattress you buy at your local mattress store might only have $300 in materials in it. Since 2014 the new breed of online mattresses have been challenging this by creating mattresses of similar quality, but with more fair markups. So a $1500 mattress you buy online has more like $400-$500 in actual materials. \n  \nUltimately, you just get more from the online mattress brands relative to the traditional / legacy brands. So I've wanted to focus my attention on reviewing the products that I think offer consumers a better value.",

That's just insane marketing / branding. It may be a good mattress, but there is no material / cost / manufacturing / transportation reason for a mattress to be that expensive (with very VERY few exceptions).\n\nA $200-$400 mattress on Amazon on the other hand has its own issues. Mattresses at the very low end of the price spectrum often use inferior foams, worse manufacturing, lower quality materials, etc. Which can lead to performance and longevity issues.\n\nIn some cases, it even leads to health / safety issues. Ex. a popular mattress seller on Amazon, Zinus, is being sued for using fiberglass in its mattresses - https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-zinus-mattress-fiberglass-health-hazard-lawsuit/\n\nThough Zinus is far from the only brand that uses fiberglass. Even so, it's the standard way a mattress meets federal fire regulations in the US at the lower end of the pricing spectrum.\n\nIn my view, mattresses in the $1000-$1500 range are the pricing sweet spot where you maximize quality and materials.",

There are some exceptions, but you need to spend quite a lot of money to get a higher enough performance memory foam to properly support the body weight.\n\n2. Adjustable foundations are great. They are a great way to reduce lower back pain and they can also help with other pains (neck, shoulders, etc.) because they force you to sleep in a more consistently supportive position. Adjustable foundations can help to relieve and prevent many types of soreness and pains, as they allow you to sleep in a pressure relieving position that creates better spinal alignment.",

                    "comment": "In general, I am really not a fan of Sleep Number (and most types of air adjustable mattresses). \n\nHere's why:\n\nVery expensive. You pay a lot of money to be able to adjust the firmness, but once you decide that you like soft or medium or firm (or whatever the number) then you'll never / rarely change it. As a result, it's just so much cheaper to find a mattress that has the firmness you need and not pay for this technology that you'll never / rarely use after the 1st time setting it.\n\nOn softer settings they really struggle. Sleep Number seems to think \"soft\" means \"sinks more\" and \"provides less support\". Every time I've slept on the softer settings I just feel like it's just sagging more in the middle. It's not actually softer. Sleep Number is best when you're in the medium-firm to very firm range. Below that, it's not great.\n\nBecause the support is created by the expandable air bladder you need to sleep right in the middle of the bladder. As you move closer to the edge or middle of the mattress you're lying on the support perimeter foam, which can create a less-than-great feel.\n\nIn my view, there are tons of options that offer better performance for far less money.",

But it doesn't really change the underlying support weaknesses of Sleep Number's air adjustable bladder.\n\nEven so, at this point you already have it, so trying to make the best out of it is key. To that end, absolutely, try adding a topper and see if that gets the comfort to where you want it to be.\n\nWith respect to topper, I would recommend at least a 3\" topper. Thinner toppers aren't going to make as much of an impact.",

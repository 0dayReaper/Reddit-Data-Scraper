    "postText": "Hi Reddit! We\u2019re Dr. Emmanuel Urquieta (Chief Medical Officer), Jimmy Wu (Senior Biomedical Engineer) and Catherine Domingo (Research Administration Associate), from the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH), an institute based out of Baylor College of Medicine with MIT and Caltech, empowered by NASA\u2019s Human Research Program. \n\nSpace is a harsh environment. Radiation, decreased gravity, and isolation present real challenges to human health. Another challenge: travelers have limited room for food, medication, and supplies. \n\nOur team includes physicians, scientists, former astronauts, engineers, and more, working to advance healthcare and keep astronauts safe and healthy. We support novel research and technologies to protect humans in space. Our work is especially important as we help prepare for NASA\u2019s planned longer-\nduration trips to the Moon and Mars. Plus, the innovations we advance in space can improve life on Earth. \n\nWe\u2019re here 1:30-4pm ET today. Ask us anything! We\u2019re particularly excited to talk about health care delivery in space, industry partnerships, improving diversity in STEM fields, and applying space research to life on Earth.\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/QAk4paa)!\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for joining us. That's all the time we have for today, see you next time!",

Some astronauts have reported changes to the duration and frequency of their menstrual cycles, as well as changes to menstrual flow. However, the underlying mechanisms for these changes are not well understood, and more research is needed to determine the extent and cause of these changes. Learn more [in this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjmgrav20168). \n\n  \nRegarding conception, there have been no reported cases of human conception occurring in space. While it is theoretically possible for conception to occur in space, there are many unknowns about the effects of spaceflight on human reproduction. The effects of long-duration spaceflight on the female reproductive system are not well understood, and more research is needed to determine the potential risks and challenges of human reproduction in space.

There are multiple scientists researching new materials that could provide better shielding against galactic cosmic rays, which are highly energetic and difficult to shield. Furthermore, very dense materials such as lead could generate secondary radiation (x-rays) through the Bremsstrahlung interaction.  \n   \nDosimeters: Astronauts' radiation exposure is closely monitored during spaceflight. Space travelers use a variety of radiation detectors to measure the amount and type of radiation. This information is used to assess the risk to astronauts and to develop strategies to reduce exposure.  \n   \nMedications/genetics: Researchers are also exploring the use of medications to protect astronauts from radiation exposure. These medications could help repair DNA damage caused by radiation, or they could prevent radiation from damaging cells in the first place. There is also the potential to use genes to increase biological resilience to radiation.  \n   \nHabitat design: Habitat design can also help protect astronauts from radiation. Commercial companies and space agencies are researching ways to build habitats that provide additional shielding, such as using water as a radiation shield or designing habitats with thicker walls or underground locations.\n\n  \n\\- EU",

Normally, ultrasound is used right next to the patient and the operator of the ultrasound needs months of training. In spaceflight, astronauts are not trained ultrasound sonographers. A new method for collecting ultrasound images used a remote sonographer to verbally communicate with the local ultrasound operator who is next to the patient. The sonographer is able to see in real-time the images from the ultrasound devices so they are able to see how the operator is moving the ultrasound to find the intended anatomical target. The group that pioneered this application of ultrasound named this technique remote guidance ultrasound.  \nRemote guidance ultrasound has been used in sports medicine to get a quick diagnosis of an athlete\u2019s injury instead of waiting until the athlete can be seen by a doctor the next day. Remote guidance ultrasound has also been used in global health to provide the highest level of diagnostic care in underserved areas of the world.  \nTechniques like remote guidance ultrasound fall into the field of medicine called telemedicine. I believe this is most translatable to health care on Earth. We saw an explosion in the use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic when all of us were under lockdown.  \nRegarding internships/rotations, TRISH currently has one internship opportunity in space health communications for Fall 2023: https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0B3d0000018IsJ/trish-space-health-communications-internship  \nKeep an eye on our LinkedIn channel for additional information about future internships at TRISH: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/translational-research-institute-for-space-health/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/translational-research-institute-for-space-health/)\n\n\\-JW",

Eventually, the body would freeze and become mummified.\n\n  \nIn addition, without gravity, the body would not experience the normal processes of rigor mortis and would instead remain in a relaxed state.\n\n  \nIf someone dies inside a spacecraft or a space suit, the body would decompose similarly to what we experience on Earth.\n\n\\-EU",

We know that countermeasures and technologies developed for space can have a huge impact on improving health for everyone here, on Earth. We regularly check in with our researchers about how they are applying their work to benefit both space and terrestrial needs. Our Industry Program focuses specifically on finding companies that are developing a product or technology for an Earth-based market while tweaking the product slightly for use in space, thereby serving both communities.\n\n  \nNASA has a website just for demonstrating the translational aspect of NASA\u2019s work called NASA Spin-Offs (https://spinoff.nasa.gov/). My favorites are probably the memory foam mattress or wireless headset.  \n\n\n  \nWe love to find new researchers that haven\u2019t connected the dots already about how their research applies to astronaut health and performance needs. We find these new potential investigators through a ton of outreach at conferences, universities, and professional scientific associations as well as attracting more investigators to find us and learn about our work. For instance, we recommend that new folks join our monthly webinar the TRISH Orbit Rendezvous (which will be back in Fall 2023; register here: https://bcm.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN\\_Ups3Kvd\\_QkCCiGiEyfpeTg)   \n\n\n  \nFor a research roadmap, you can check out the TRISH Strategic Plan that shows our 6 strategic goals (See the Strategic Plan link at the bottom of this page: [https://www.bcm.edu/academic-centers/space-medicine/translational-research-institute/what-is-trish](https://www.bcm.edu/academic-centers/space-medicine/translational-research-institute/what-is-trish))  \n\n\n  \nTRISH is funded through a Cooperative Agreement with the NASA Human Research Program. They have a clearly laid out Human Research Roadmap that you can peruse at your leisure here: https://humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov/ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- CMMD",

While it is theoretically possible for conception, birth, and/or child development to occur in space, there are many unknowns about the effects of spaceflight on human reproduction. \n\n  \nThe effects of long-duration spaceflight on the female reproductive system are not well understood, and more research is needed to determine the potential risks and challenges of human reproduction in space. [Learn more in this article.](https://www.inverse.com/science/future-of-human-sexuality-space)\n\n  \nIn terms of child development, there has never been a child in space, and that is a long time off. We can only speculate. However, humans have evolved to grow and live in an environment of gravity and low radiation. The space environment is characterized by 0 gravity and higher radiation, which could affect growth and development.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-EU",

However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that microorganisms have evolved in any significant way as a result of exposure to space conditions.\n\n  \nThere are studies looking at genetic changes in bacteria after exposure to simulated microgravity conditions. Researchers have found some changes in gene expression and protein production, but these changes were relatively minor and did not significantly alter the overall function.\n\n  \nSpace conditions can be harsh for living organisms, with exposure to factors such as cosmic radiation, extreme temperatures, and vacuum. These conditions can damage DNA and other biological molecules, which could potentially lead to mutations or other changes in microorganisms over time. However, the extent to which this occurs and the implications for human health are still not well understood.  \n\n\n\\-EU",

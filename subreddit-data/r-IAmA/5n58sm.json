                    "comment": "TRANSCRIPT:\nThis is the whole proof of life topic. We saw that evolve. It\u2019s both gratifying and alarming. I will explain why.\n\nI the rest of the team at WikiLeaks were very pleased there was such an expression of concern about how we were doing. We expected attacks against me. If you looked at my public statements and some of the statements tweeted by WikiLeaks in the lead up to my Internet being cut off and to that difficult diplomatic situation, we were saying that the attacks are going to come in and we will need people to defend us, we\u2019re going to need an army to get through this. And then the concern for how I was doing and why I wasn\u2019t being seen arose.\n\nMany were calling for \"proof of life\" but we are interested in something quite different. Anything that we did that claimed to be some kind of proof of life would be to set the precedent on what mechanism could be used to reduce concern about how we were faring. The calls, for example, that I issue a PGP signed message. \n\nThat's fine if you can understand that it\u2019s me issuing the PGP signed message, but a PGP signed message doesn\u2019t tell you who has issued it at all. It\u2019s just a plain message. So, let\u2019s look at what kind of precedent we would be setting. We would be setting the precedent that when there\u2019s a concern about whether one of our staff has been kidnapped or me, that concern can be destroyed simply by someone issuing of a message of text, which is coupled to a particular cryptographic key. \n\nBut if WikiLeaks is under a threat so serious that its people have been kidnapped then it is possible that it might lose control over its keys. The reality is that it\u2019s quite hard to protect keys from that kind of interference. The way WikiLeaks manages its keys, its submission keys, for example, they are not used to sign messages, but even if WikiLeaks did sign a message in this case, what would it be saying? It would be setting a precedent that could be very dangerous in the future.\n\nIf you produce the person and show that they are not under duress, you can either hack a WikiLeaks key or take control of infrastructure or take control of a person and then claim that they had produced some signed message.\n\nWe are much more interested in creating a precedent for proof of freedom from duress. Or making it hard for our people to be under duress. The best way to do that is live video. Because even if you were under duress (there\u2019s various forms of duress that could be applied) if you have live video then you\u2019ve got a few seconds to put things out. You can slip in code words into what you\u2019re saying. (I\u2019m not, by the way. I\u2019m not!) But you can slip in code words into what you\u2019re saying that your people could then see. So, yes, I\u2019m alive and free from duress, but I *am* in a very difficult situation.\n\nI have been for six years. Let\u2019s not think that I\u2019m not in a difficult situation just because I am alive. As I explained, this embassy is surrounded by high tech police and intelligence operation. It is a difficult situation. I haven\u2019t seen the sunlight in the last four and half years. It\u2019s a tough situation. I\u2019m tough, but you should be concerned about the situation.\n\nWhat we had hoped is those people concerned with my safety would direct their attention to those people who are responsible for the situation. That\u2019s the UK government, the US government, and the Ecuadorian government. Some of you did and that\u2019s quite possibly why my Internet has been restored--because of the expression of concern.\n\nBut, when the concern became very prominent, a black PR campaign infested the concern and tried take it off somewhere else and largely succeeded.\n\nWhat happened? Fabricated messages, claiming to be from our staff were posted on 4Chan on Reddit. Fabricated videos claiming to be from Anonymous [posted on YouTube]. Completely fabricated. Dozens of them. And what was their intent? What were they calling for? They were calling for people to not trust WikiLeaks, to not give it leaks, and to not give it funds!\n\nIt\u2019s obvious who benefits from the production of such a black PR campaign and it should be obvious in hindsight to all those people who were trying to support me that those types of messages were deliberately intended to undermine WikiLeaks and, in fact, undermine my support.\n\nIf this sort of thing happens in the future, think to yourselves, is what is claimed undermining the ability for WikiLeaks to operate, the ability for it to get new information, and the ability for it to financially support itself? And if the answer is yes then you should be extremely skeptical about what the claim is.\n\nHaving seen how concern for us can be manipulated and misled, but also the degree of concern, we now have a game plan for if this kind of thing happens again and I am confident about the kind of worldwide support we can get, if we get a similar type of attack again in the future.\n\nYou can see that I am speaking and maybe, apparently, sane, but don\u2019t reduce your concern. I am in a difficult situation. That\u2019s a reality. But the difficulty of the situation [has long been] expressed on Justice4Assange.com, UN findings, etc.\n\nWikiLeaks itself are also in a difficult situation. Constantly spied upon, harassed, etc. So, support us now. Don\u2019t wait until we are in a situation that might be difficult to get out of. Make sure we are strong now, going into difficult situations, as a result of what we publish!",

Obviously a black PR campaign erupted and your message here has clarified (for a lot of us in sure) why the situation was handled the way it was.  Quite frankly, a lot of us were just very worried.  Here in the US, especially in this political climate, it's not hard to jump to the conclusion that something bad may have happened to you.  There are so many news stories flying around that nobody knows who to believe anymore, so a random guy on reddit seems just as credible as the next, especially when it comes to your safety.\n\nAnyway, just... thanks again.  I can't tell you how grateful I am, personally, for everything you've done for me and for my country and for the world.  Thank you Mr. Assange, I truly hope to get you home to your family soon.  Thank you so much.  If there is ever anything a 27 year old guy from Wisconsin can do to help you I will absolutely drop what I'm doing and do everything in my power to help you and your organization.  Thank you so much.",

                    "comment": "TRANSCRIPT:\n\nI have to say that it is a little bit silly. Not in relation to us being under pressure. We have been under a lot of pressure, but we\u2019re very good at resisting pressure. But, in relation to whether I\u2019m alive or kidnapped. If you look at people like John Pilger, for example, long-term friend of mine, runs my defense fund, is a famously brave investigative reporter, my lawyers, close friends, people like Lauri Love, the Ecuadorian government. If you think about the number of people who would actually have to conspire and the amount of work that would have to be done to produce these false images is too many. That\u2019s a social proof. And to understand that, one needs to look at the costs and understand the costs involved in trying to pull together all those people and trying to keep a lid on them and engage in all this kind of fabrication technology, which does not yet exist, as far as anyone can tell, in a capacity to do what is done. To do all that, that\u2019s the cost. And then, but for what benefit? That\u2019s an interesting question.\n\nIn thinking about real-time proof of life, intellectually, the most interesting [method] is to take the most recent block in the blockchain, in the bitcoin blockchain, give the number and at least eight digits or something of the hash and then maybe to spell out this hash by sign language. That\u2019s intellectually entertaining, but what is the problem with it?\n\nWell, let\u2019s see if I can get a recent hash. While it\u2019s intellectually entertaining, the problem with it is this \u2014 it\u2019s very complicated, the underlying technology, so it has the same flaw that sophisticated voting machines have, cryptographic voting machines, which is the average person can\u2019t understand whether the security claims are in fact born out. Now experts might be able to, but the average person can\u2019t and so then you\u2019re back to a social proof. Does the average person trust the expert? And then how do they know that those experts are really experts that haven\u2019t been compromised?\n\nSo, in fact, while it\u2019s intellectually entertaining, it\u2019s not at all a good type of proof of currency. But, I\u2019ll give one anyway, so this is block 445706 and the hash is 178374F687728789CAA92ECB49. Ok, I think I made a mistake in the block number, which is going to drive everyone crazy! So, the block number 447506. This is how you can tell it\u2019s real time because of mistakes! Hash 178374F687728789CAA92ECB49. OK, intellectually entertaining.\n\nYou don\u2019t actually have to read out the whole hash number, maybe eight digits or so combined with a block number would be enough to show currency within a ten minute, hour, period, something like that. But the better way to show currency is news that can be widely checked, is widely spread, and is unpredictable before it happens. The best would be a few different natural disasters, maybe a lot of weather measurements, and otherwise need something that\u2019s not easily predicted and which can be widely checked or widely seen at the time. And a good example of that is sports scores. \n\nFor example, the New Orlean Pelicans versus the NY Knicks won 110-96, Oklahoma 109 versus 94 Chicago, Dallas 92 versus 101 for Minnesota. So, that can give you currency.\n\nIn terms of any future precedent, if I disappear or someone else disappears, the answer to if we are OK or under duress should be given by two things in future: Number one by lawyers, publicly associated close friends, people who fund my defense campaign. So, let\u2019s look at those. John Pilger, The Courage Foundation, people associated with it, my lawyers, such as Jennifer Robinson, Margaret Ratner in the United States, Melinda Taylor.\n\nAnd [number two] the ability to do live interactive video, where someone, even though theoretically they could be under duress, can interject in the stream quickly to say such a thing or to give a variety of messages in a live way, which each one is not comprehensible at the time that is said, but the last one, if you like, provides the conceptual key to decrypt them. (I am not doing this now! I am not doing this now!).\n\nI very much appreciate the support. It had some good effects. I think it probably contributed significantly to restoring my Internet. \n\nBut a lot of that well-intentioned support was waylaid by a black PR campaign, so don\u2019t let that happen again. And, that\u2019s it. Thank you, Reddit. Thank you, Redditors, for spending so much time on our material. We are really, really happy with it. Thanks. ",

So useless.\n\nSo, literally 0 assurance is better? So many of your supporters are on the verge of jumping ship, yet you continue to do nothing but say \"trust, trust, trust.\"\n\nEdit: I'm going to take his response as a reason to disassociate myself from my support of Wikileaks and Julian Assange. His refusal to provide verification proves that he has been compromised in a significant way. This goes against the initial purpose of the keys, and I believe is the canary in the coal mine, the signal we've been waiting for that Wikileaks and Assange are not what they once were.\n\nEdit: If someone says \"Don't trust me if I can't find the key...\" and then they refuse to provide the key, sounds to me like an awfully good reason not to trust someone.\n\nEdit: The key is about more than proof of life, see the quote from the original post by /u/g2n below: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5n58sm/i_am_julian_assange_founder_of_wikileaks_ask_me/dc8pgqr/\n\n&gt; It is likely that Julian is alive. However, failing to digitally sign a message with the Wikileaks private key is of great concern. It is possible that Julian is no longer in control of Wikileaks, provided that he cannot sign a message with the private key. \n\nEdit: Another poignant response from /u/g2n: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5n58sm/i_am_julian_assange_founder_of_wikileaks_ask_me/dc8ycd4/?st=ixruv7pj&amp;sh=545faa96\n\n&gt;Thanks for your response.\nWhile it is true that anyone with your private key could provide fake assurance, we are going off the assumption that you are the sole owner of the private key. It is clear from the video AMA that you are (likely) unharmed but I am still unsure about Wikileaks being compromised.\nAdditionally, there's no drawback to you using the private key to sign a message, or any key for that matter. I don't see how signing a message would imply that you need to change how you secure your private key.\nWith that said, the only reason I can think of to why you aren't signing any messages anymore, is that you don't own it anymore.\nWould you care to please prove me wrong?\n",

I'm assuming that you're intelligent enough to realize that a memorized key would always be extracted and took the same precautions I would.\n\nNow,  I figure the CIA can force you to do just about anything they want by threatening your family.  Because of these threats you're effectively working for the CIA, and if I was the CIA and I was giving you a job description it would go something along the lines of: \"Return to the embassy and remain there; assist us to convince the world that Wikileaks is still a functional, independent agency\".  So, you're here on reddit doing that, and whatever else your handlers direct you to.  It strikes me though that the one thing your handlers cannot by any means force you to do is to give up a key you don't have.  Drugs won't work, torture won't work, killing your family won't work;  there is literally no way for them to recover that key.  \n\nYou signing with the key proves nothing.  The CIA may well have been able to torture it out of you or seize it, and in that case they can use it as well as anybody.  But the inability to sign with the key would be one of the only indicators we would have in such a scenario.\n\n",

Censorship of this, and any topic relating to your safety or wellbeing forced the creation of alternative subreddits such as /r/WhereIsAssange and /r/BannedFromWikileaks.\n\nA little over a month ago, the newly added moderator 'Here4Popcorn' began claiming that he was in direct contact with you / your organization. We learned from a discussion with another of the moderators that that he was apparently the only one in the team who had been contacted. When asked if he was confident of the authenticity of the claims, we were told that it was 'probably' actually you.\n\nAre these claims true? If so, why was perhaps the most controversial member of the new moderation team selected as your only point of contact?\n\n**Edit:** Contrary to Julian's original response, it's now been [confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5daxix/send_your_messages_of_support_to_julian_assange/dd6r288/) that Sarah Harrison was in fact in contact with Here4Popcorn and did tell him that if he gathered letters from users she would deliver them directly to Assange",

It\u2019s a small embassy. The embassy is surrounded by a police and intelligence operation, of which there are numerous pictures and admissions by the British state. They admit to spending 4 million pounds a year, just on the covert and overt police surveillance, not including MI5, etc. They have sophisticated robot cameras installed in different buildings, plainclothes police operating on the street and they\u2019ve done deals, of which we have the paperwork, with some of the opposing buildings owned by Harrods, which is a big department store here. Harrods is owned by the sovereign fund of Qatar.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not an easy environment to work in. Spying on the outside, some spying on the inside, informers, robot cameras, etc. \n\nThen during October, there was pressure applied by John Kerry and the US administration and other forms of pressure domestically within Ecuador, that resulted in my Internet connection being cut off and an increase in the security environment here, in terms of people getting in and out of the building easily, etc. It was wrong for John Kerry to politicize the office of the Secretary of State and try to use that for domestic political advantage by pressuring me through my political asylum. WikiLeaks does not publish from the embassy. It doesn\u2019t work from the embassy. I am political refugee stuck in this embassy because the UK refuses to obey international law and respect my asylum rights and let me leave the country. We publish from France, Germany, the Netherlands, and so on, a wide range of countries. But not Ecuador.\n\nEcuador is purely pressured because they are responsible for my physical security as a political refugee. Which is disgraceful. To be fair to Ecuador, they have denied that they were pressured, but that\u2019s not what our sources say. It\u2019s a small country, 16 million people, an innovative, tough Latin American country which has stood up to enormous pressure from the US and UK, but it has it\u2019s own election on February 17th and you can see it wouldn\u2019t want an allegation that it had interfered, which it hasn\u2019t, with the US election, being used as an excuse by Hillary Clinton, who was the predicted president, to interfere with the election in Ecuador.\n\nAn intense security and diplomatic situation. \n\nDuring this recent pressure conspicuously and heavily armed British police arrived, which I took a photo of and which we published, parking their vans right next to the embassy, which they haven\u2019t done, since back in 2012 when the first kind of stand-off was in the embassy. It is a of show of force, presumably to make some kind of pressure for WikiLeaks to stop publishing, but we are setup to continue on regardless of what happens to me.\n\nNo one person in WikiLeaks can become a single point of failure. Why? Because we don\u2019t want to fail, number one. Number two because if that person is perceived to be a single point of failure, it places that person in danger.",

Let\u2019s pull back and understand what\u2019s going on.\n\nWikiLeaks has published more than ten million documents over ten years. We have a 100% accuracy rate on authenticating our publications. Everyone in the media knows that we have a 100% accuracy rate. Despite our publications affecting powerful groups, which are by definition are connected to the establishment media, this media is in a difficult position. Due to the perfect credibility of our content, ad hominem attacks are used to color perception or create displacement because no direct attack is possible. So, we get all sorts of ad hominem attacks about WikiLeaks, about our sources and about me - i\u2019ve been called a cat torturer, A Mossad agent, CIA agent, a Russian agent now, and a pedophile twice recently on CNN (by the former CIA 2IC).\n\nWikiLeaks has published more than 800,000 documents that relate to Russia or Vladimir Putin. Most of those are critical. More than 2 million are from Syria. We have material from China, we\u2019ve been banned in China, etc. Each country\u2019s establishment tends to perceive WikiLeaks as something that is difficult for them and that erodes the authority of state institutions and that\u2019s true in the United States. \n\nWikiLeaks said it was ready to drop a bombshell on Russia? Not quite, we said we had important document pertaining to Russian corruption and yes, the FSB was apparently quoted as saying that they can electronically attack WikiLeaks. We published regardless. Those were the Russian-related documents in the our diplomatic cables series and they are extremely strong on Chechnya and Russian crime. A number of books were written from that, some calling Russia a mafia state. A number of successful lawsuits against the Russian State have made use of those documents and other documents.\n\nAnother common untruth is the claim that I worked for RT, the Russian State TV. It\u2019s absolutely false. In 2012, we setup a production company and our production company worked with Dartmouth Films, a UK production company and a distributor, Journeyman Pitches, and twelve episodes were filmed of me interviewing people. It was called *The World Tomorrow*. It was my first TV production. We licensed that to a dozen different outfits and RT was one of them. RT aggressively promoted it internationally and then people tried to twist this story into having a \"job\" at RT because they have no arguments about content.\n",

                            "comment": "TRANSCRIPT:\nThat\u2019s an interesting question, but why the irritation? Why the irritation compared to publishing all at once? Critics would say, if we published all at once, that we deliberately made a giant bomb. You deliberately published all at once, in order to have maximum impact.\n\nIn WikiLeaks publications over the last ten years, we have used a variety of publication strategies depending on the amount of material, how readily engaged the audience is, and what the timeframe is for publication. What we have found is that we should closely match the demand curve with the supply curve. Humans can read a limited amount of words each day.\n\nThere is a finite number of people. There\u2019s a finite amount of time. There is a finite reading speed. So, the demand for words, even if an audience is 100% interested in that subject, is finite. It is optimal to match the demand for a particular type of information with the supply of that information. If there\u2019s oversupply of information, above the demand for it, then the oversupplied part is not read and of course, we want our publications to have maximum possible readership understanding. Our sources, of all kinds, want maximum possible impact. They don\u2019t want to go through these risks for their material to not be read.\n\nWe are proud of our election publication strategy. We had limited time and limited resources. Yes, we could have done things slightly differently if we had had more time more staff, etc, but within our resource constraints, we put together I think a pretty kick-ass publishing schedule designed to maximize uptake, readership, engagement, and knowledge extraction from our publications. \n\nThe strategy was designed to be hard to attack. What do I mean by that? Well, in this particular case, we have the Democratic campaign of Hillary Clinton and her associated media allies doing everything they could to spin what we were publishing. I know how this works. If there\u2019s knowledge that WikiLeaks is going to be publishing, say over a month-long period, then a crisis team is set up. We have had a number of these WikiLeaks war rooms and crisis teams setup against us by different governments and companies. From Bank of America to the Pentagon and State Department. They get ready each morning, wait for our publication, and then try to spin it. Insofar as our publications are at all predictable, that spin can be lined up ahead of time and those war rooms can be perfectly resourced. So, we made sure that what we were going to publish was unpredictable, when we were going to publish was unpredictable, how much we were going to publish each day was unpredictable, that we had both a human element looking closely at what was happening on the news and on social media and an algorithm, which also introduced cryptographically secure noise into publication decisions in relation to amounts and timings and making that decision on the fly, not a month ahead of time with a schedule all planned out. Why? Because if we were hacked, we didn\u2019t want, in this case our algorithm, the Stochastic Terminator, its programmatic output to be known in advance because that would permit the Clinton campaign and others to attempt to counter-spin our publications at each moment and we want our publications to be as unspun as possible. \n",

I worked with our legal team to get him out of Hong Kong and to a place of asylum. No other media organization did that. Not the Guardian, which had been publishing his material. Nor did Amnesty, human Rights Watch, not even any institution from a government. It was WikiLeaks that acted. A small, investigative publisher, which understands computer security, cryptography, the National Security Agency, which I have been publishing about for more than ten years, and asylum law, because of my situation.\n\nWe couldn't have a situation where Edward Snowden ends up in a position like Chelsea Manning and is used as a general deterrent to other whistleblowers stepping forward. Edward would have been imprisoned at any moment in Hong Kong and would have then been turned into the propaganda that if you\u2019re trying to do something important as a whistleblower, your voice will stopped and you\u2019ll be placed in prison in very adverse conditions.\n\nWe wanted the opposite. We wanted a general incentive for others to step forward. That\u2019s for philosophical reasons, because we understand the threat of mass surveillance, but it\u2019s also understandable for institutional reasons. WikiLeaks specializes in publishing what whistleblowers reveal and if there\u2019s a chill on sources stepping forward, that\u2019s not good for us as an institution. On the other hand, if people see yes, it\u2019s good for sources to step forward, then there will be more of them. \n\nOn full publication versus the sadly limited publication of Snowden files--Edward Snowden hasn\u2019t really had a choice. He has had various views that have shifted over time, but he is in a position where we made sure he had given the documents on him to journalists before he left Hong Kong. Both Edward Snowden and I assessed that it would be a dangerous bait for him to be carrying laptops with NSA material on it, as he transited through Russia to Latin America. That might be something that would cause the Russians to hold him. So he and we made sure he had nothing. Since the point of those initial disclosures, Edward Snowden hasn\u2019t been able to control how his publications have been used.\n\nEdward has been a very important voice in talking about the importance of different aspects of them, but he has had no control. The result is that more than 97% of the Snowden documents have been censored. Enormously important material censored and while there have been some good journalists working on them, and I think Glenn Greenwald is one of the best journalists publishing in the United States, you have to have hundreds of people and engineers working on material like this to understand what is going on.\n\nWe have a different position to those media organizations that have effectively privatized and limited that material. You can\u2019t say that the initial publications had all the important docs. There have been  more publications slowly as time goes by. Even some within the past two months. Those publications, for example, include ways to find interception sites in the United States used by the NSA. There are covert procedures to visiting those sites. Now, if those had been released in 2013, investigative journalists and individuals could have gone to those sites before there was a physical cover-up. That\u2019s true in the United States and it\u2019s true in Europe and elsewhere. I am sad about how the impact of the Snowden archive has been minimized, as a result of privatizing and censoring nearly all of it.\n",

Too many people in the overall general public have the mindset that \"If I have nothing to hide, then I have nothing to fear\" in regards to their privacy. This is absolutely 100% false. \n\nI wish I could remember where I read it, but I once read an article that pointed out that there were literally hundreds of laws on the books that people don't know about and are daily violating because they're so small and trivial, and nobody thinks about them as a result. What it boiled down to is that if privacy was lost, then all it would take is some menial excuse to detain, and then ultimately, incarcerate someone based on the accumulation these tiny laws. Granted, there was a lot of tinfoil hat stuff in there, but the idea is pertinent I think.\n\nEdit: I should probably put this in here since I'm blowing up a bit as well. (congrats to /u/DirectlyDisturbed on blowing up and getting gold). I agree with most everybody who has replied or messaged me about this - I think that there are limits to how far privacy should go. Nobody should have absolute, 100% opaque privacy. However, where those limits are, I do not know. I personally believe and am of the opinion that those limits are up to us, as a society to determine. If everybody is okay with, as one person suggested, having cameras in every bedroom to verify that consensual sex happened, then so be it. I was more trying to generate discussion and get people to think about this than I was trying to prove a point or make a statement (seems like it worked). The doomsday examples were just that - doomsday examples. A bit of thought exercising with a tinfoil hat on. I know bits and pieces of history and know sort of how societies and governments have gone from good to bad. Again - mostly my opinion from what I know of history, but the role of privacy has been key in those transitions.\n\nAlso, it was pretty cool to hear him read this comment almost verbatim. Anyways, I should probably get back to doing work instead of geeking out. Great comments and replies everybody, honest. I wasn't trying to pick fights with anybody, and if it seems like I did...my bad. Thank you for keeping things civil all! Great discussion and comments from everybody.",

It\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s not about whether you have something to hide. It\u2019s about whether society can function and what sort of society it is. The key actors in society who influence its political process: publishers, journalists, dissidents, MPs, civil society foundations, if they can\u2019t operate then you have an increasingly authoritarian and conformist society. Do not think that this will not affect you. Even if you think that you are of absolutely no interest, the result this attitude is that you have to suffer the consequences of the society your apathetic conformism helps to produce.\n\nYou\u2019re not an island. When you don\u2019t protect your own communications, it\u2019s not just about you. You\u2019re not communicating with yourself, you\u2019re communicating with other people. You\u2019re exposing all of those other people. If you assess that they\u2019re not at risk, are you sure your assessment is correct? Are you sure they\u2019re not at risk going into the future? Perhaps the biggest problem with mass surveillance is that the knowledge of mass surveillance. Fear about it produces intense conformity, so people start censoring their own conversations and eventually they start censoring their own thoughts. \n\nIt\u2019s not enough to create fears about mass surveillance. At the same time, one has to create an understanding of how to avoid mass surveillance or an understanding that at the moment, most of the mass surveillance authorities, like the NSA and the organs it feeds are pretty incompetent. But that will change as artificial intelligence merges with mass surveillance, when the data streams from the NSA and PRISM program are fed into artificial intelligence.",

The primary WikiLeaks support group, WikiLeaks Task Force, said it was \"thinking\" about creating what data points are needed to create a map of predictors to understand the influence relationships between people who are involved in influencing on Twitter.\n\nVerified users are influential, who influences those users? But that\u2019s a discussion question by a support group who explicitly stated that it\u2019s not about publishing addresses.\n\nBut why is that story spreading? It\u2019s spreading because of two reasons. Number one, as a result of the efficacy of our publications and their perceived damage to the US ruling class, there\u2019s a desire to reduce our reputation in the establishment press, so such Tweets are grabbed onto, re-assigned, taken out of context, and promoted. I also see a second reason, which is interesting. Is there exists a two-level class hierarchy on Twitter. People with blue ticks and people without blue ticks. There\u2019s about 230,000 users with blue ticks and they correspond with something like about 30% of people who would consider themselves members of the establishment in English speaking countries. Those are MPs, journalists, CEOs, etc. People who are representatives in some way and therefore have a need to interface with the public. About a third of those types, in particular, the upcoming ones, are on Twitter and they have blue ticks. So you have here both an identity phenomenon (where someone is branded with an identity of a blue tick and so an identity politics is emerging within this group) and also a class phenomenon. The recontextualization of the WikiLeaks Task Force discussion point into a threat against this identity group was then widely spread by self same identity group which also lined up fairly neatly with the \"liberal\" establishment politics of something like 80% of that identity group.\n\nThink about this new emerging identity class. It has a quality. Within the blue tick class that is you have a blue tick or you don\u2019t. So metrics looking at what the relationships are between people in the blue tick identity class and exterior (of Twitter) class dynamics, relationships to power of various kinds, removes some part of the equalitarian nature within the blue tick identity class, which can be seen a a threat to those people who have gained the blue tick, but are otherwise not in power in the exterior class. It\u2019s interesting. \n",

You'd been asked previously on multiple occasions to deny a state party was the source for these releases but [refused](https://youtu.be/pK2weomgl4k?t=279), saying it would be \"dangerous\" and \"irresponsible\" to do so.\n\nI found it very suspicious that, just weeks later, the first time you *ever* denied a source was in a [heavily-edited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUAOTFIXbp8) interview aired on RT, an organization that obviously benefits from you denying they're the source, regardless of whether they are. You've reaffirmed the other day that you're uncomfortable having so.\n\n[Your denial](https://youtu.be/_sbT3_9dJY4?t=161), in particular, seems to be spliced together from three separate responses (masked by cuts to reaction shots), in response to a question removed in the cutting room (though the cut happens a few frames after he starts to open his mouth to ask it). With zero follow-up from you or Pilger.\n\nMy question is twofold. Do you think the edited interview accurately reflects the answers you gave? If so, did your previous business arrangement with RT in any waeny influence your decision to break WikiLeaks's most sacred rule in an interview exclusivley aired on their network?",

Absolutely not. In fact, we explicitly stated that we did not believe that was so. The key journalist and newspapers who collected the Panama Papers in Germany are our publishing partners, so we knew about the story. We aggressively promoted it. However, the particular story that came out on Vladimir Putin, which was pushed as the leading story in the Western press, rather than issues relating to say David Cameron or Western figures coming out of the Panama Papers, was funded by USAID and Soros Foundation. They funded an organization called OOCPR, which does sometimes good work, but is based in Maryland and focusses exclusively on negative stories about Russia and the former Soviet states. So, you have a story on Vladimir Putin produced by an organization, which exclusively focuses on Russia and the former Soviet states that is based in Maryland and is funded, the only funders listed, by USAID and the Soros Foundation. That is no model for integrity. And that\u2019s what we said. Some good journalism, but this is a difficulty when you have negative stories about Putin being pushed forward and funded by the US government. We are trying to distinguish WikiLeaks' model of publication, where we are funded by our readers and not by dodgy foundations or the US government. We don\u2019t like it when we are in competition with an organization based in Washington, DC and funded by the US government. Readers should be able to distinguish which sources are more reliable to give you the truth. One that is funded by a government attacking a figure in another government or one that is funded by its readers and has a track record of publishing everything with time limited redactions.",

            "comment": "During the recent Hannity interview, you (Julian Assange) said:\n\n&gt; We published several Podesta emails which shows Podesta responding to a phishing email. Now how did they respond? Podesta gave out that his password was the word 'password'. His own staff said, \"This email, that you've received, this is totally legitimate.\" So this is something that a 14-year-old kid -- a 14-year-old kid! -- could have hacked Podesta that way.\n\nHowever, in going through the Podesta email dump, the only match to this \"password\" claim was [this email](https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/22335#searchresult) which is just someone telling Podesta that the default password on his new Windows8 PC was 'p@ssw0rd'.\n\nSo the statement you made seems disingenuous in multiple ways.  First, that password wasn't quite as simple as 'password', but given the medium, we can ignore that one.  Second, that password is unrelated to the [phishing email](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34899).  Third, that was just a default PC password, not the password to his network or Gmail account.  Fourth, [other email](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/6589) suggests that his password was actually 'Runner4567'.\n\nLastly, and this is the part that I'm most interested in, [another email](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34899) suggests that Podesta had 2-factor authentication enabled on his Gmail account.  Even with the password, no 14-year-old kid is going to hack Podesta's email in that way if it was enabled.\n\nSo, my questions are:\n\n* Do you have any evidence that Podesta's password for whatever account was hacked was actually 'password' (or a similar phonetic version)?\n\n* Do you have anything to say regarding how Podesta's Gmail was seemingly hacked while 2-factor authentication was enabled or if it actually wasn't enabled?\n\nEDIT:  Added email links and formatting.",

You were referring to **DNC hack data and John Podesta emails.**    \nYou did not mention the possibility that WikiLeaks got the material from a third party.   \nAnd because submissions to WikiLeaks are anonymous through TOR network, it's practically impossible for WikiLeaks to identify the leaker if he doesn't want to be identified. If leaker wants to be identified, it is still possible he impersonates somebody. I understand that you can't give any details about those submissions.   \n\nThere is some substantial evidence and consensus among US based security companies that original source of **DNC servers hack** could be hacker groups related to Russian government (Fancy Bear aka APT 28 aka Sofacy aka GRU and Cozy Bear aka APT 29 aka The Dukes aka FSB). But its all based on Reports of one Security company [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/) that could be biased. [Some suggest it has ties to FBI and Obama.](http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=62536) CrowdStrike reports seem to be main source for US intelligence too.  \nAPT28 and APT29 were identified based on infrastructure they used, use of domains, hacking tools and targets.

Since you are in the Ecuadorian embassy, what assurance can you reasonably provide that a courier was not compromised?\n\n* In an [interview with Sean Hannity that played on his radio show on Dec. 15, 2016](https://youtu.be/7FuQwedAWHI?t=7m28s) you provided the following rationale for publicly stating that your source was not a \"state party\":\n\n&gt;Assange: We're unhappy that we felt that we needed to even say that it wasn't a state party. Normally we say nothing at all. But we have a conflict of interest. We have an excellent reputation, a strong interest in protecting our sources, and so never saying anything about them. Never ruling anyone in or anyone out. We sometimes do it; we don't like to do it. We have another interest which is maximizing the impact of our publications. In order to prevent a distraction attack against our publications we've had to come out and say no, it's not a state party. Stop trying to distract in that way. Pay attention to the content of the publication.\n\n* 3 - Anyone listening to this explanation might reasonably wonder whether this is a tacit admission that you are willing to either lie or otherwise deliberately mislead if doing so would promote your organization. You reiterate repeatedly your interest in \"maximizing the impact\" of your publications. What assurance can you give that your interest in promoting your organization is constrained by other commitments?\n\n* In [the same interview with Hannity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FuQwedAWHI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=20m33), when asked about the Craig Murray story that was published in the (highly unreputable) Daily Mail, you stated:\n\n&gt;Hannity: Let me ask you about Craig Murray, former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, an associate of yours. He was quoted in the Daily Mail that he flew to Washington D. C. for the emails. He claimed he had a clandestine hand-off in a wooded area near American University with one of the email sources. And the leaker's motivation was \"disgust\t at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation\" and the \"tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders,\" and he said that the source had legal access to the information. The documents came from inside leaks not from hacks.\n\n&gt;Assange: Yeah. We don't comment on sourcing. Craig Murray is a former U. K. ambassador. He is a friend of mine. He is not authorized to speak on behalf of WikiLeaks.\n\n&gt;Hannity: Are you angry that he gave this interview?\n\n&gt;Assange: I just don't want to go anywhere near that.\n\n* 4 - Granting that Craig Murray is not authorized to speak on behalf of Wikileaks and that you are not interested in commenting on the bizarre account he gave to the Daily Mail, can you clarify whether or not Craig Murray is actually *associated* with WikiLeaks? Does he have any connection to the organization or is he just a personal friend of yours?\n\n* 5 - Why did you mention [the death of Seth Rich on the Dutch program Nieuwsuur in Aug. 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7FkLBRpKg)? Here is some of the exchange you had:\n\n&gt;Reporter: What are you suggesting?\n\n&gt;Assange: I'm suggesting that our sources take risks. They become concerned to see things occurring like that.\n\n***\n\n&gt;Assange: We have to understand how high the stakes are in the United States and that our sources face serious risks, that's why they come to us so that we can protect their anonymity.\n\n&gt;Reporter: But it's quite something to suggest a murder. That's basically what you're doing.\n\n&gt;Assange: Well others have suggested that. We are investigating to understand what happened in that situation with Seth Rich. I think it is a concerning situation. There's not a conclusion yet. We wouldn't be willing to state a conclusion, but we are concerned about it. More importantly, a variety of WikiLeaks sources are concerned when that kind of thing happens.\n\n* 6 - Can you clarify what it is that you were trying to convey with these remarks? If, as the reporter assumed, but you did not confirm, you were suggesting that Seth Rich was a source for WikiLeaks, then your remarks seem incredibly rash. How can you provide your sources any sense of security if you are publicly suggesting that your sources are being murdered? If, on the other hand, you were suggesting that your sources themselves were mistakenly under the impression that the recent death of a DNC staffer for unknown reasons may have been foul play, and that you were interested in reassuring them that WikiLeaks protects its sources, why would you fan the flames of their mistaken impression?\n\n* 7 - What assurance of safety can WikiLeaks actually provide their sources other than refusing to name them?\n\n* 8 - Why did you [request for a Russian national to be your personal bodyguard](https://archive.is/wEW0o) in the Ecuadorian embassy?",

If you answer these questions I respect that a lot, anyone who does an AMA and answers tough and fair questions is at least showing a bit of bravery, and I applaud that IF it happens.\n\nNow first off: Finally it was reported that you offered a reward for information about who killed Seth Rich. Seth Rich's family has pleaded to people to stop promoting conspiracy theories and wild ideas about their loved one's death. Many saw your offer of a reward as some sort of confirmation that there was a connection between Seth Rich and Wikileaks. Can you please, for the sake of the family of the victim, confirm that you have no information linking Seth Rich to Wikileaks, or any evidence at all that the DNC, Hillary Clinton, or any Democrat committed the murder? I know it is an unsolved murder so hypothetically it could have been anyone, I'm just asking you to tell your followers (many who saw this as a subtle message of support of their conspiracy theories) that you do not have any information on the case.

I do not question the veracity of the contents of the emails about HRC's campaign. However, if your organization is committed to impartial access to information, how do you reconcile holding verified information back to time it for \"maximum impact,\" which was the reason I believe you gave for releasing the Podesta emails in waves instead of all at once. Shouldn't an impartial distributer of information release any information it has once it has it (and has been vetted, of course)?\n\nTwo, your organization's alleged collusion with Russia. Given that your organization [threatened to release information on Russia](http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/10/26/is-the-kremlin-about-to-get-wikileaked/) and then didn't, after [threats were supposedly made against you by Russian intelligence service](http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/11/01/russias-fsb-to-wikileaks-we-could-destroy-you/). Since then you have not published anything (to my knowledge) negative on Russia, and have obtained a Russian visa and a TV show on Russian television, and even criticized the leak of the Panama Papers as a US plot to attack Putin (a strange position for the founder of an organization whose goal is to leak documents). \n\nGiven that, why should the average person on the street believe you when you say Russia was not the source of the Podesta emails, when your organization, and you personally, have had a cooperative and positive relationship since you refused to leak information on Russia back in 2010?",

Recently, I\u2019ve read the NSA has begun to [target people who use Tor](https://www.cnet.com/news/nsa-likely-targets-anybody-whos-tor-curious/) and may even have begun to compromise a number of [Tor nodes]( http://www.idigitaltimes.com/best-alternatives-tor-12-programs-use-nsa-hackers-compromised-tor-project-376976). Do you know if there\u2019s any truth to this, and if so what steps would you recommend to preserve anonymity online?\n\n2)\tCan you say anything about the content of the leaks we can look forward to this year?\n\n3)\tLastly, what can we do to help? I routinely share WikiLeaks material with my friends and family and I donate as often as I can\u2014is there anything else I can do to get more involved and better support WikiLeaks?\n\nThanks again for all your efforts and for taking the time to answer questions on reddit.

With ten million documents, adversaries can scan your documents and create a false narrative based on verifiably sourced documents, be it for financial, social, and or political benefit. \n\nThis already occurs on the wikileaks subreddit. False narratives utterly divorced from your original published source documents are upvoted while intellectual honesty that deviates from that narrative is not only down voted but actively censored by the mods. As one such example, I countered a post that promoted the idea that eric schmidt personally donated a secret $1.5B to the clinton campaign, something that is utterly divorced from your source document. My post was down voted, then deleted by the mods and I was banned without explanation. The post containing the false narrative however still remains and is upvoted and the poster in question still actively promotes these false narratives. A read over the mod logs would reveal this has become very typical in recent months. Will you denounce this?\n\nI think its a testament that humans prefer simplicity to complexity and the lack of critical thinking that dominates our society. It also promotes self censorship, a post in politics must be framed in a specific way vs a post in a wikileaks. Failure to do so leads to outright censorship or censorship through ranking which ultimately is the same as the system increases. \n\nHowever my experience represents a rather easily debunked comment but more well funded attempts where the narrative isn't divorced as much as its factually misleading i see as the real threat. e.g. People trust wikileaks, but they won't read the documents instead they turn to other journalists who cite wikileaks for their interpretations such as breitbart news. Their trust in wikileaks extends their trust to these untrustworthy news organizations. Strategically this is useful for your adversaries to attack you on.  Alternatively left leaning institutions will say yes hillary was corrupt but its more of being a shrewd politician and then go on to cite your source documents that support that narrative but leave out the ones that don't. With the rise of a.i. I only see the ability to launch disinformation campaigns as getting worse. \n\nWhich is why your verified twitter user info graph is so frightening. The lowest common denominator of fan does not think critically. They will see connections and impropriety where there is none and will act on it. Comet pizza being one such example. But online harassment and doxxing of critics is another, even if it's not done by your organization but rather by 'fans'. \n\n**You promote the idea that wikileaks is scientific journalism which requires input from the public some of which will be valid criticism. How does this work when the least common denominator of fan attacks any critic?**\n\n**Do you feel censorship through complexity poses a serious threat for you and other like minded publishers?** \n\n**do you think the rise of ai will make disinformation campaigns against you and similar organizations trivial? How is this combatted?**\n\n**Even though it's officially unofficial, will you denounce the censorship on the wikileaks subreddit?**\n\n**Do you intend on moving ahead with the twitter inforgraph?**",

We were all glad to see you were alive and well through the Hannity interview.\n\nWith Obama being succeeded hy president-elect Trump, do you think there may be a chance that international relations will relax in terms of your 'legal' proceedings? Would you settle for nothing less than full amnesty?And what reparations, if any, would you seek for these last 6 years?\n\nThank you for being our champion. Another comment mentioned you were opposite to Snowden in that you don't believe in privacy but I don't think that was ever your platform. As far as I know, you don't believe in the privacy of government and people who run the country due to the high potential for corruption. That's all I have to say!",

Wikileaks always stood for transparency, in this vein releasing them makes sense, however it feels as though the *way* these were released was intended to be more political than just for transparency sake.\n\nCan you please explain the reasoning behind this?",

What was done differently while you were offline? Some of the tweets seemed silly, such as pizzagate references.\n\n4) What was (supposed to be?) \"phase 3\"? Do you have any more material related to Hillary Clinton and her campain or the DNC? What's up with the hashes?\n\n5) What was going on with the last WikiLeaks AMA? A lot of unanswered questions and some claims that I would not expect to be made by WL staff.\n\nI am *not* saying that you or WikiLeaks are compromised, just to be clear. I would be interested in these responses. Thanks in advance!",

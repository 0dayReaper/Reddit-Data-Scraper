    "postText": "**My short bio:** I am a Junior that goes to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, I was in my 4th period class, Holocaust History, my teacher is Mrs. Schamis.\n\n**My Proof:** I wish I could provide concrete proof, but my phone is still in the classroom so this is a screenshot of my schedule on my Virtual Counselor http://prntscr.com/ifnngt\n\n**EDIT New Proof:** My student ID - https://imgur.com/a/4FJjU#1yeF8Vx\n\nHi everyone, my name is Sid, I'm a Junior at Stoneman Douglas and I'd like to share my story of what went on in [room 1214, the third room](https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/2EUXR1ZMYKOXietnIWiME2HyPxbqeFWu0OhUn-U3BIE/https/image.prntscr.com/image/scY9hNCkQ1_nLGOsx_VdKw.png?width=676&amp;height=327) that was shot into by the shooter, and where two victims, Nick Dworet and Helena Ramsey were killed.\n\n2:20 PM - We are working on the laptops doing an online activity when we hear about 10-15 gunshots outside of our door. Everyone scatters and from about 25 kids, two groups were split in different corners. I was in the corner that is immediately to the right of the entrance, Nick was in the back right corner that could be immediately seen from the entrance. The group with Nick and Helena were trying to form a barricade with a cabinet and a computer cart (one that holds laptops and charges them) but without even 20 seconds to react, the shooter comes to our door and starts shooting through the window of the door. He was shooting at the corner that Nick and Helena were in as well as about 12 other students with them in that corner. Nick got caught in the fire and died immediately, Helena also got caught and died within seconds. I was in the opposite corner so I couldn't see his body because a cabinet was in the way, and I'm thankful that I didn't witness his body because it probably would have affected me much more. My classmate Aalayah told me she had to use Nick's body as a shield once she saw he was dead immediately :(\n\n[Here is an edited version of the map](http://prntscr.com/ifnd5k) to show the corner where I was hiding (blue), where Nick and Helena were (orange) and where the shooter was shooting from (red). Thank you for the support you have been giving. And if any of you came out to the vigil yesterday, I have no words for how happy I am that you came to support.\n\nIf you have any questions about what went on on Wednesday, let me know, I'm here to fulfill your interest.\n\n#**The AMA is now over but that doesn't mean I won't reply to you if you message me, thank you all!**",

The news has said that the fire alarm went off right before this happened but from what I\u2019ve seen you say, there\u2019s no mention of it.\n\nYes, the fire alarm did go off. Despite beliefs, the fire alarm went off about 10-15 seconds AFTER he started shooting, I remember clearly. People across the school couldn't tell however, so they were treating it like a regular fire drill until word got around within a minute and everyone rushed back into their classrooms.",

These can be mutually exclusive, as pointed out by other users with examples like drywall dust and cat hair triggering false alarms. There is a ton of particulate matter in the air in the third room shot into. This is proven in [(NSFW) THIS HORRIFYING VIDEO](https://m.liveleak.com/view?i=9ff_1518644376)\n\n",

As soon as I got into my spot, I started to ask my teacher \"Are we geniuinely going to die right now?\" as soon as that last word came out of my mouth (now), the shots started ringing into our classroom. I had my head down and I was behind her desk so I couldn't see if the shooter had came into the class or not (he didn't), so I thought within seconds he would turn to me and shoot me, but thankfully he was only outside of the classroom shooting into it from the door window.",

I believe he was locking a door when he was murdered. It doesn\u2019t surprise me if it\u2019s true that he was trying to save others. He was a hero.\n\nI worked with him for 3 years at camp starlight where he is a complete legend. Maybe the funniest guy I have ever met. I remember at the end of camp when all the counsellors got a small gift from their adl. Beigel bought us all a fucking key ring with his own face on. The man was a genius haha.\n\nGod bless Scott. You\u2019ll be so sorely missed my so many.",

You talking about it here shows big things for your processing of the situation imo, but don't let the visible progress deter you from seeing a professional. Even if you just go once it stands to help you, and help you learn coping strategies moving forward.",

Many trauma counselors were offered at the time of the shooting, but the real, long-term need comes later, from interviews I've read from student survivors. By meeting with a counselor now, you might be able to develop a relationship that will help you even years later as you deal with this. So please do take up the offer for counseling now, and/or get the name of counselors if you choose to talk later.",

But, despite beliefs, the fire alarm went off about 10-15 seconds AFTER he started shooting, I remember clearly. Everyone in the Freshman Building (the building my room was in, its a 3 story building with mainly freshman based classes) knew that there was a shooter outside so no one left their rooms.\n\nPeople across the school couldn't tell however, so they were treating it like a regular fire drill until word got around within a minute and everyone rushed back into their classrooms.",

Here\u2019s what I can tell you:\n\n1. Expect that you\u2019re not going to feel normal for a while. What you\u2019ve been through is traumatic and you will need time to process. If you find that you have trouble sleeping, eating, or just carrying on with day to day life just accept that this is very normal and that it will pass. \n2.  Try to remember the five Fs to get you through the immediate future: friends, family, faith (this does not necessarily mean religion, it can be anything that makes you feel spiritually connected such as a walk or meditation), food (the nutritious kind that nurtures you), and fun (it will feel strange to laugh or smile but you need to embrace the good in life). \n3.  It will possibly be tempting to turn to alcohol or drugs but do your best to resist those urges if you have them, this type of coping will only cause problems later on. \n4.  This will take a long time to heal and some things will never be the same. Take advantage of offers of counselling and don\u2019t be afraid to talk to others when you need to.  Also, don\u2019t put any expectations on yourself about how you SHOULD feel or react. Whatever you feel is ok. \n5.  Focus on the love and support you see right now, it will help. \n\nIf you need to talk you can send me a message at any time. I\u2019ve been through this with other kids. Take care. \n\nEDIT - Thank you for the kind words and gold :)\nI think when something terrible and shocking happens most people want to do what they can to help. I am amazed by first responders and could never do what they do, but I can talk and I can listen and sometimes that helps. \n\n",

But I spent the whole school year with her so far and I can tell you that she would always be smiling while talking to her friends and she was a very positive person.\n\nNick (NICHOLAS DWORET, not the ruthless murderer who's full name I don't even want to say) was not necessarily a friend of mine, but I have had MANY conversations with him over the course of this school year. In particular, I remember our first conversation earlier in the year we were talking about what concerts we had went to during the summer. I told him I went to the Playboi Carti concert and the XXXTentacion concert, and he told me he went to the Lil Pump concert. He also told me stories about how he got caught doing bad things with his friends and how when Junior year started (he's a senior at this point) he made a resolution to focus on his schoolwork and make sure he stayed obedient to his parents because his swimming career was thriving at that point. Nick was one of the most pure individuals I have ever met, he always had a smile on his face. I remember specifically a few weeks ago he announced to the class that he committed to University of Indianapolis for swimming and everyone was applauding him and he did one of this gestures where you lower your head and scratch your head because you are embarrassed but happy (if you get what im saying). Every time I scroll down my instagram feed and see his face, I break down and its just all around rough to think about his family and his girlfriend and anyone else who was closer to him than I was.",

About a minute after the shooting stopped in our room, I look over to my right and in the opposite corner, a girl named Samantha had blood all over her face and her eye was swolen (I believe a bullet grazed her face), but she is luckily ok. I couldn't see Nick or Helena's body because a cabinet was in the way.

People have asked me what I think about him taking the video during a time like that, but to be honest, there really is no dissecting what was going through his head in that moment. Some people take in situations like that differently, and react differently, and that's perfectly normal. I wish he hadn't taken that video and focused on his safety first, but what can you do.\n\nFor anyone asking if Matt is ok, yes he is. He's also in my Algebra class and he was also in my English class last year.",

They then said \"is anyone injured, how many of you are in there?!\", before anyone could say anything I screamed \"4 injured, there are about 25 of us in here, please help!\". They said \"we are coming in! hands up!\" When they came in they got the injured out of the room immediately.\n\nAfter the injured got out of the room, they made us get up and walk out in a single file line, and when I was out of the room I had to walk over a dead body right outside of the door just to get across the hall.\n\nI heard that the shooter went out toward the middle school next to us and tried to blend in with people running away from the school and went to the walmart down the street, but I don't know a lot about exactly what he did after. What I can tell you is that it took about an hour or two after the shooting to find out who he was.",

Here was a response I wrote to one of the comments that is relevant to most...\n\nMy school really is a bit different.\n\nFirst, I pay for ALL the school supplies. Every pencil... Every sheet of paper.... every year. I pay for ALL of the dual-credit college courses and books. I pay for every meal for kids that don't qualify for the program and still can't afford it.\n\n80% of my kids are impoverished. \n\nI don't think I've said 100 words to the teachers in the decade plus I've been the superintendent about test scores. We focus on making individual connections with the kids first and foremost.\n\nWe simply can't make facility upgrades like we need. The entire taxable property in my district in under 25 million. So, the last bond here was in 1938. I pay cash for upgrades. \n\nI'm better today. We had already been meeting and have a solid plan. We even have a member of our community who works with homeland security who has helped.\n\nI truly believe the best way to avoid this is to have every kid feel connected and valued. We do that better than anyone. \n\nIt's just the overwhelming fear...what if I fail?\n\n",

Twenty seconds isn't enough time. Fortunately, in an office building, there are a lot of floors, and he'd be unlikely to start on mine unless he worked here and had a reason.\n\nAnyway, I figured the way to go would be shutting the door (which locks on its own), blocking it with my guest chairs (which wouldn't hold it but would delay the shooter for a second), turning the lights off (and the monitors, as the screens would give the game up!), grabbing anything that could be used as a weapon (scissors, etc.), and then hiding under the desk with the chair pulled in to block me from view.\n\nBut yeah...time and presence of mind, as I said. Probably not going to happen. :-p Still, it's a better position than in an open classroom in a one-story school.",

How do you manage 8 classes? \n\nI hope you are doing well, and I hope you reach out to a professional to talk about what happened",

In my freshman and sophomore years you would have 7 classes that were all 50 minutes long in one school day. \n\nNow we have 8 classes, but 4 classes on Silver (A) day, 4 classes on Burgundy (B) day. The days are called Silver and Burgundy because that is the colors of our school. Each class is about an hour and a half long, every student is given a study hour class on one of their days that takes up a whole period. My study hour is my third period as you can see.",

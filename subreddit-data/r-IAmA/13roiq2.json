In a country of 8 million people, with 2 psychiatrists, we have started a new psychiatry residency program that was last year accredited by the West African College of Physicians. Separately, but linked, in Eastern Sierra Leone, in Kono, and linked to Koidu Government Hospital, we have developed a continuum of mental health care that includes a range of providers. They go into the community and work with people directly. The heart of this work is non-specialists, that is, community members who provide support at a household level. We are excited to continue this commitment!\n\nLearn more: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/f133e3f4f4a64710ba559944eb10777c",

Its where I currently live, and despite having autism, I didn't qualify for other facilities because I'm literally too smart. The only other place we could go is *possibly* a group home, which wouldn't afford the same dignity.\n\nIMO, us 'low care' mentally disabled who aren't seniors are an under-served, under-acknowledged demographic. We can't live on our own, or hold a job, but are too, ahem, 'high-functioning' and young to qualify for anywhere else. I suspect many like us are homeless in the streets, even.\n\nCan I get your opinion on this?",

She does not require 24/7 care and can be relatively self-sufficient (e.g. can dress herself, but needs help bathing).\n\nThe wait list for a state-run home is some thirty-odd years.\n\nI will eventually be in charge of her care, and planning for it is a nightmare. The government systems feel like a punishment to navigate, and they're often pretty pathetic. I genuinely don't know how she'd live off government help alone; it would not be enough to cover shelter and water anywhere in this state, forget clothing or medical expenses.\n\nI do not know what people do if they don't have relatives willing and able to care for them. I think you're absolutely right, there must be a lot of people who just go homeless on the streets.",

I received little support from my own parents, and drove them nuts with how I struggled to do simple chores until I moved out.\n\nWA state bureaucracy is manageable for me, but I stress, no bragging, I'm extremely intelligent, which gives me a huge leg up in comprehending and navigating these things.\n\nMy support comes from a variety of programs. If your sister's disability payment is low enough, she might qualify for a Community First Choice program. That's the program I'm under to afford my place, and another Medicaid program that covers all my Medicare subsidies. \n\nAll I pay really is a predetermined rent each month, with a given amount left over for... Whatever. If your sister was disabled before she was 26, another important thing to look into is the ABLE program. Long story short, an ABLE account will allow her to have assets without losing benefits.\n\nPlease hang in there! I know its hard, but I promise, its just as hard on your sister! Above all else, be gentle with her. We often are painfully aware of how incapable we are, and criticism (as opposed to acknowledgment) is not helpful.",

Its pretty common to see them gossiping or watching videos in the med/break room, and I don't mean that as a criticism.\n\nThe call light goes off once in a blue moon.

It\u2019s all me being autistic. My inability to wake up before 6pm and increased energy levels between then and 2am? Autistic trait, it turns out. \n\nMy anxiety and depression? Caused by years of not having my needs met and immense social confusion with no one taking the time to explain socializing the way I needed it to be explained. \n\nChronic pain? It\u2019s sensory overload that I was never allowed to manage, and now that I am able to stim without being stopped it is gradually decreasing. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m happy to continue in dms if you want to talk more, as I find you pleasant to communicate with and think we may have much in common, but my point about the book is that it isn\u2019t only for people who have ASD and have obviously needed a lot of support for it; it\u2019s mostly for people who didn\u2019t get that support and have comorbidites or are socially marginalized in other ways (gender, race, income, etc) and who learned their own ways to cope/\u201cmask\u201d growing up and have done so so effectively that people think they can\u2019t be autistic.",

Many of us are gamers because we have trouble getting out, and we need *something* to pass the time (and its a good coping mechanism). Housekeeping does each room once a week, and handles laundry, though there is a resident laundry for those who prefer to do it themselves.\n\nIf you aren't on disability yet, apply and GET A LAWYER. They work for free upfront, and only get paid if you win, and only a small fraction of your backpay.\n\nOf course, that assumes you can find a place that can take you... Hence the problem. But I think someone like you would be able to figure it out.",

There is an enormous need for improved mental health services and a long way to go, but we are creating alliances and initiatives to try to improve access to mental health care around the country. It is important to note that this issue intersects not only with clinical and structural levels of the health care system, but also with assisted living, supported housing, and legal systems, to name a few. It will take a blend of policy and insurance changes, as well as widespread campaigns to combat stigma surrounding mental health conditions, for us to see structural shifts in the health system.  \nEach person\u2019s journey with their mental health is highly individualized, however, there are many resources that exist that can provide additional information and guidance on where to turn.  \nPlease see the following links for more information:  \nSupport Groups | NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness: https://nami.org/Support-Education/Support-Groups  \nDisability services | USAGov: https://www.usa.gov/disability-services  \nBenefits for People with Disabilities (ssa.gov): https://www.ssa.gov/disability/  \nASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES - Volunteers of America (voa.org): https://www.voa.org/services/special-needs-services/",

Having a \"label\" was everything because before that I didn't even know other people went through what I do. \n\nPeople who act like \"everyone has ADHD/autism now\" are overlooking the vast numbers of people, primarily women, who have been systematically ignored by the medical profession for decades. But now that we're advocating for ourselves getting the help we were denied as kids it's apparently \"trendy\" or we're faking? Fuck off with that noise.

In a lot of cases I see, mental issues are only issues when they aren't addressed and cared for. Everyone's brains are built differently, and some of us have more disruptive builds. Learning about yourself, and others, is important for \"neurotypical\" and \"non-neurotypical\" people alike. Some people don't have issues in one setting, but start expressing mental health issues in another, and that can be in anyone.\n\nTo the original asker:\nYou're looking after your daughter in her whole self by getting mental health attention. Don't look at it like a disease, but possibly something more akin to weak ankles, where they are capable, but may need special attention, or sturdier shoes. A lot of higher functioning people get lost in the all or nothing mindset, and that causes a lot of stress... She may or may not have the mental equivalent to weak ankles, but finding out and treating her appropriately will help her not reach the point of the mental equivalent of broken ankles.\n\nAnd if it is worse than that, it's not the end of the world. There is help out there, but it doesn't sound like anything severe considering what I've heard so far. I wish you and your family the best.",

Evidence-based psychotherapies, such as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, delivered by a mental health professional, can be an important first step.

                    "comment": "Separate from mental health care, we recently heard one of PIH's founders, Dr. Jim Kim, speak to the legacy of Dr. Paul Farmer on the anniversary of his passing. \n\nDr. Kim described: \n\n1) a preferential option for the poor; \n\n2) the highest possible quality of care for those who need it; \n\n3) be truly present with the suffering of others; \n\n4) \"accompaniment\" as the core of clinical and social innovation; \n\n5) the \"hermeneutic of generosity\"- always assume the best intentions in others; \n\n6) start with a single patient or program and then go; \n\n7) invest in students; \n\n8) commit to communities and stay the course;  \n\n9) build systems (and support staff, stuff, space and social support). \n\nThese ideas were helpful to us 15 years ago as we were starting to get going. HIV and TB care had strengthened the primary care systems within which PIH worked through the 1990's and early 2000's. But there were few formal mental health services. \n\nWe started by building small systems out of disasters: the 1994 Rwanda Genocide Against the Tutsi, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2014-16 Ebola crisis in West Africa, and a number of other crises. We used these situations as opportunities to strengthen mental health support. We collaborated closely with our site based leaders to build out systems. We supported the professional development of committed, local providers. We took care of the sickest people, initially. We showed that people could get better. We collected data and measured outcomes. We adapted the concept of a health care delivery value chain, published by Farmer, Kim and Porter in the Lancet in 2013, and built out a value chain for mental health car delivery that we felt reflected the realities of where were were working. But really, we started small, as our team is small, and there are few providers. \n\nWe've tried to be responsible in not growing work too fast, beyond the capacity of the individuals providing care to meet the very significant need. Here are some resources that might build out your explorations on this topic.\n\nHere are some links to learn more:\n\n[https://www.pih.org/MHMatrix](https://www.pih.org/MHMatrix)\n\n[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/global-mental-health/article/expanding-mental-health-services-in-low-and-middleincome-countries-a-taskshifting-framework-for-delivery-of-comprehensive-collaborative-and-communitybased-care/43537788DF743160294EE33C618B4D9F](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/global-mental-health/article/expanding-mental-health-services-in-low-and-middleincome-countries-a-taskshifting-framework-for-delivery-of-comprehensive-collaborative-and-communitybased-care/43537788DF743160294EE33C618B4D9F)\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32180989/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32180989/)\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23697823/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23697823/)\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283580084\\_Taskshifting\\_translating\\_theory\\_into\\_practice\\_to\\_build\\_a\\_community\\_based\\_mental\\_health\\_care\\_system\\_in\\_rural\\_Haiti](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283580084_Taskshifting_translating_theory_into_practice_to_build_a_community_based_mental_health_care_system_in_rural_Haiti)",

In the news, we have read about various problems with care being provided by people without credentials to do comprehensive evaluations, medication shortages, as well as other safety concerns, related to telehealth. Yet telehealth is certainly increasing access in many positive ways. If we want to develop person-centered care, many people prefer the convenience of telehealth as well. In many instances, however, meeting with a person in person is essential to obtain the most accurate information and to provide the best quality care. It is such an interesting time to be human, to be experiencing so much rapid social change, and to be struggling to keep up with all of the technology. (No one has asked about chat gpt yet! )",

I'm fine with next month, they deserve their pride... but it's next month and it's already out! Nobody I've asked even knows it's mental health awareness month.\n\n(Meanwhile it's weeks btwn appointments to solve my ptsd problems I've had for decades, constantly getting the runaround from docs. No one seems to be advocating to make this easier for anyone. My meds are controlled strictly because other ppl can't be trusted to not abuse them making my mental health worse trying to get ahold of them.)\n\nWhat awareness is happening and changes are being advocated for?",

            "comment": "I'm experiencing depression in a debilitating way that has affected my 36-year nursing career profoundly, to the extent that my director attempted to have me committed a little over a year ago (I was released in less than 24 hours after speaking to the psychiatrist who realized I'd been involuntarily sent to the psychiatric unit without cause). I have now been barred from cost-of-living and merit raises both last year for the psych incident and this year because my \"performance\" has not been adequate, according to my director - who is a huge proponent of toxic (and I do mean toxic to the point of gaslighting) positivity. I'm not positive enough, and he routinely harps on me to look at everything as an \"opportunity for improvement,\" which is fine in some cases but doesn't apply in so many others. My staff thinks I'm doing an amazing job and most are not aware of my depression. The surgeons where I work tell me constantly what a great job I'm doing. Meanwhile, my director scrutinizes my every move and finds fault no matter what, which is extremely disheartening. I am being treated for the depression with medications and therapy - although I'm currently between therapists because mine moved out of state.\n\nI am trying to make a case for discrimination due to my disability of depression. I have actually gotten an accommodation for the disability which is supposed to be more frequent breaks but I rarely get even one break a day, let alone \"more frequent.\"\n\nI know this is a quick overview but I'd have to practically write a novel to tell you the whole story. My question is this: Do you think this qualifies as discrimination due to this disability?",

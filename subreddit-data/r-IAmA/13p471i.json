    "postText": "We are the Bloomberg News reporters who investigated the long-lasting health difficulties, particularly among young children, following Australia's Black Summer wildfires three years ago. The blazes exposed an estimated 80% of the population to smoke and we spoke to families, medical professionals and academics to discover a range of troubling and long-lasting health complications. And concerns are mounting we're not ready for the next disaster.\n\n\nAmy Bainbridge and Angus Whitley spent six months working on a documentary and feature story that pointed to the grim health impacts from wildfires facing the next generation. These blazes are forecast to become more common and destructive, posing health risks for increasingly fire-prone regions from America and Europe to Asia and Africa. \n\nYou can read our deep dive here https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2023-australia-wildfire-toxic-legacy and watch our documentary here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htGnXYcSlms\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/zhuw4xp8wd1b1.jpg\n\nEdit: That\u2019s a wrap!

I was sitting in my lounge room and noticed smoke was creeping in under the doors and through window gaps.

I also remember many of us were wearing those things called face masks to prevent some irritants getting into our respiratory system. \n\n\nWhile as long as the planet has had trees, I\u2019d expect there to have also been bushfires. What difference is there to the toxicity of trees and bush land burning now, compared to 100+ years ago?",

And it\u2019s one that we asked experts during our reporting. An out-of-control wildfire will burn through more than just trees and vegetation. It incinerates cars, metals, plastics and thousands of buildings. So many of the toxic materials used in those things \u2014 from asbestos to metals and minerals \u2014 can become airborne and are breathed in by people who are close by or hundreds of kilometers away.\n\nFay Johnston at the University of Tasmania, who is one the world\u2019s leading air quality experts, described to us how it works in detail. Wildfire smoke contains hundreds of substances including tiny aerosolized particles, carcinogens and harmful gasses like nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide.\n\nAnother doctor we spoke to said walking around Sydney during the height of the Black Summer fires was equivalent to smoking 37 cigarettes a day, and more than that closer to the fires.\n\nWe asked Indigenous experts how the harmful effects of wildfires were managed in the past. We were told that specific grasses and vegetation can be burnt, depending on the time of year, to minimize the smoke. -AW",

Mothers questioned whether CPAP machines would have been necessary if there wasn\u2019t smoke from the fires. One had to have her baby removed from her for a second time to address breathing issues. She recalls looking out the window of the hospital at 10am and only being able to see a red dot in the sky amid the darkness of the smoke.

                    "comment": "Building homes that are more resilient to smoke is really important. And, actually, the fact that some homes block out smoke better than others makes it harder to formulate policies to protect the community. It also makes it harder for researchers to measure the impact of smoke exposure from a data perspective because people will be hit in different ways depending on the construction of their homes.\n\nBut there are sign of progress. Governments and academics recognize that improving building codes is one way to make sure future generations aren\u2019t so susceptible to smoke while they\u2019re in their own homes. It also makes it more feasible for communities to ride out bad smoke at home rather than having to evacuate to specific smoke-proof buildings.\n\nThe Australian Capital Government, for example, has said since the Black Summer fires that it\u2019s committed to improving the sustainability standards of buildings and designing and upgrading facilities to improve resilience to extreme smoke events through insulation, air locks, automatic doors and draught-proofing. -AW",

This has impacted some communities I\u2019ve spoken to in the past few years because it changes the way you can rebuild your home. The materials and building standards can be different when you go to rebuild, for example to be more fire resistant. On a community level, one interesting thing the ACT government is doing is establishing clubs as refuges. \u201cThe community, including those who are most vulnerable, will be able to attend these refuges during heat and smoke events for respite,\u201d a spokesman told us.

It\u2019s also a blanket measure that may not actually be necessary for all communities.\n\nOne other thought on this. Families we spoke to found it almost impossible to keep out smoke in any practical way, even with air conditioners running all day and night, and after taping up doors and windows. One family I remember came back to their rural home after evacuating in early 2020 to find ash everywhere. Just everywhere. Even under the toilet seat. Three years after the fires, some families still have traces of soot on their properties. -AW",

I imagine there are some design experts out there who know if this has been considered \u2013 cost would likely be a huge factor. One of the things we were repeatedly told was there are difficulties in evacuating. One mum evacuated to Canberra, but the smoke there was just as bad, so she went home. Then she and her family were trying to block off doors and windows with wet towels and it simply didn\u2019t work. The kids were trapped inside and this made it even more stressful. That is why there is some discussion about using the high grade air filters, known as HEPA units. Suggestions include subsidizing these filters, or making them available to hire from a local health service during periods of intense smoke. Some of us have become more familiar with what types of air filters are on the market these days due to Covid. Also, aside from having safe community evacuation spaces with filtered air, doctors say they need to make sure hospitals have adequate air filtration systems as well to keep people safe during this time. -AB",

    "postText": "Back in 2005, I was diagnosed with a very rare brain tumor. A pilomyxoid astrocytoma. Doctors believed that even with surgery and treatment that I would only live a year or 2 more. After brain surgery, I went through radiation treatment which killed the remaining tumor tissue, but resulted in me being left with mild short term memory loss. I was 12 at the time of diagnosis and I am now 30. \n\n The type of memory loss I have is called Mild Cognitive Impairment\n\nThe Make-A-Wish Foundation granted my last wish, which was a trip to Hawaii. My family and I went to Maui. \n\nProof: https://imgur.com/gallery/QWkl8wX",

I was told when I was diagnosed that only 3 other people globally had even ever been diagnosed with a pilomyxoid astrocytoma. All of them only lived about a year or 2 after diagnosis. Doctors had no idea why my surgery and treatment was so successful (I only did radiation therapy, never had to do chemo, because the radiation worked)  \n\nThe hospital sent my tumor off to be studied and they continued giving me regular MRI scans every year up until just now. I finished my final MRI checkup this year.",

He\u2019s got a lot to answer for in my opinion. \n\nLets be honest tho, if u were a rich king with a town of peasants, wouldn\u2019t organised religion be a great way to keep them quiet and not question why you have it so much better? Religion offers hope to people whose life isnt good, hence why the poorest countries are the most religious. Its a premise built on sand.",

Got to meet a few people, and the shopping spree ended up being so much more.\n\nLike you, I had radiation on my brain, though I'm doubtful it was as extreme as yours.\n\nLike you, I think I've finally come to realization that I probably do suffer from STML, or at the very less have ADHD, haha.\n\nLike you, I can remember past details pretty vividly, but I often forgot if I had brushed my teeth for the day, or what I had to eat. Seemingly trivial things like that. Makes me wonder if the radiation I had to go through is also the cause of it. \n\nWhen going through treatment, they were worried that my IQ might drop, but seemingly the doctors did tests after wards (I don't remember these in the slightest), and they said I was fine. I had to do radiation treatment for around 4-5 weeks, once or twice a week. It wasn't too much. I do remember HATING the smell when they did it though.",

It isn't that the machine is producing an odor (although that could be possible as well), but that the radiation interacts with the nerves and causes you to smell it.  This can happen with head CT's as well.  It also happens to some people from injected solutions like IV flush... they'll think they are smelling an alcohol like odor that was released into the air, but it has actually been released into the blood and moved to the nose/lungs/etc.",

Leave notes and post-its around for reminders or set reminders on your phone. Get a dry erase board for your house and hang it in a central area of your house, write down reminders, grocery lists, etc. Get a physical calendar and hang that in a central area as well. Use Repetition a lot. Repeat lists in your mind or out loud that you need to remember. Like if you're going to the grocery store for egg, bread, and butter, then write them down or repeat \"eggs, bread, butter\" at least 5  times in your mind or out loud. If you're married, download a shared calendar/list app. Both of you can create lists or add events to your shared calendar and it automatically syncs and updates with each other. Make a habit of double checking everything, and have a designated spot for all your belongings at home. Like your car keys for example, everytime you get home just put them in the exact same spot every single time. It makes it harder to forget where you put stuff.",

Whenever I lose something it can take 2 minutes or 2 weeks for me to find it again so something as simple as swapping the handlebars on a bike ends up taking several days, most of which is spent looking for lost tools and parts.

Luckily it doesn't require a full cranioctomy, just a small hole with a drill. Did they saw your skull open?\n\nI have had several surgeries inadvertently from the epilepsy. My seizures are infrequent, but incredibly strong. I lose consciousness for hours, sometimes losing an entire day. One day I was pouring myself a cup of tea, when I had a seizure. I woke up the next day in the hospital with a massive 3rd degree burn on my right flank. That required a skin graft, and several laser treatments to break up the scar tissue. My skin still feels like leather and has significantly reduced sensation though. \n\nMy last seizure was February 2022, and it also required surgery. I fell on my thumb breaking it pretty badly. They had to put in metal pins while the bone set. They were extremely painful, and every time I hit something with my hand, I could feel them in the bone. Honestly that was far worse than skin grafts. That required two surgeries, one to put them in, and one to take them out.",

I have to wear glasses, my vision is pretty horrible.  \n\nI also had \"carpe Diem fuckit syndrome\" for many years following the experience. Really didn't lose it until I got married and had kids and had something other than my own future to look forward to. As a teenager that just realized how young I could die, I didn't think about or plan for my far future much. Trying to enjoy each day as much as possible, without giving much thought to how it would effect me many years later. If you're 17 and realize it's a possibility that you won't live to turn 20, why would you spend time worrying about planning for a career or retirement? My favorite quote ended up being \"Time you enjoy wasting is never wasted.\" and I lived by it. But I also stopped caring a ton about things like my health because, \"why eat healthy and exercise if I may not be around in 5 years?\" I also for many years wondered if I had the ability to have kids because of the radiation. Doctors weren't sure if it had caused any effects. But I now have 2 healthy kids, ages 9 months and 2 and years old. Now, I want to live as long as possible to see them grow old. I want to eat healthy and exercise so I can play with them throughout their whole childhood. I want to see what sort of people they become.",

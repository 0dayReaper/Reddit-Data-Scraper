    "postText": "[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/RLNNVY6)\n\nI\u2019m a U.S. Air Force fighter pilot. I started my career flying the F-16, where I led pilots into combat\u2014there, I flew 80+ combat missions, often supporting troops under fire.  \n\nI then transitioned to the F-35, which was still in development at the time. During my last role on active duty, I became the Chief of Training Systems for the largest training base in the world, leading the development of new technology and teaching methods to train future fighter pilots.  \n\nI\u2019ve spent the last several years writing a book - [\u201cThe Art of Clear Thinking\u201d](https://static.macmillan.com/static/smp/art-of-clear-thinking/) It provides a toolkit for people to make better decisions in their lives. Think Top Gun meets a Malcolm Gladwell book. It just came out this week and has been doing well, so thank you for the support.  \n\nAsk me anything!  \n\n*Edit: Wow, After I signed off, I didn\u2019t expect this AMA to take off like it did. I\u2019m back for a while to answer some more questions.",

You can take the afoqt 3 times and tbas twice so \n\ntake afoqt fall of sophomore year so start studying in the summer for it. Table reading, math, and pilot spatial orientation are key to a good score so practice all those. Table reading was the hardest for me. \n\nTake Tbas for the first time after you\u2019ve taken the afoqt once. Study for the tbas by looking at a proprofs.com directional compass practice game. It\u2019s huge for the tbas. Other than that, you can\u2019t study much for it besides just make sure you\u2019re good with quick math like 78+16, that\u2019s a big part of one of the sections.",

Decision-making is a universal skill that applies to everyone--whether you're a doctor, lawyer, teacher, student, or parent, the decisions we make are directly correlated to our success.\n\nMost schools don't spend any time on a structured approach to decision-making. However, as fighter pilots, that's one of the primary focuses during our training. \n\nConcepts such as Assess-Choose-Execute, Power Laws, Expected Value, and Fast Forecasting can be used in any situation. Give the book a read and if you don't like it I'll Venmo you your money back. Same for everyone. \n\nIf you're not a big reader, feel free to listen to the audiobook. I did all the reading and for the first time in history, parts were read while flying in a jet aircraft.",

Like paperwork, entering stuff into the computers, and that sort. Does it get old real quick or is i, while repetitive, just part of the job?\n\nHow difficult is formation flying and refueling? Do most (all?) prospective pilots figure it out sooner or later or is that something where people actually wash out of training?\n\nHow are the ergonomics of the cockpits? I imagine it can't be comfortable in the least, even at my computer at home I want to get up every hour at the latest! For example in terms of controls placement and getting sore arms (or even repetitive strain injuries) since you spend a lot of hours using the controls, or is that all designed well in modern jets?\n\nDo you have a favorite and least favorite weapon that you like to employ, and what makes them enjoyable/not likeable?\n\n(Not sure if you are allowed to answer this, don't get yourself in trouble) - to which extend are the F-35's network capabilities already utilized? The official press releases tout integration with everything and the kitchen sink and I'm sure it's a powerful capability. Do you already operate that way or is that still waiting for the other platforms/units to catch up with the F-35?",

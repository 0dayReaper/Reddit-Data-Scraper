    "postText": "Hi Reddit! My name is Dr. Eugene Lipov and I\u2019m the Chief Medical Officer at Stella, an emerging leader in the research and treatment of post-traumatic stress. Today, I\u2019m here to answer questions about trauma and the treatment options available in recognition of Mental Health Awareness Month. Ask me anything. \n\nA little background on me \u2013 I discovered a treatment for PTSD called the Dual Sympathetic Reset (DSR). Based on a procedure called the stellate ganglion block (SGB), DSR consists of two injections of local anesthetic next to a bundle of fight or flight nerves in one side of the neck to reset the nervous system. In just 20 minutes, DSR can alleviate even the most severe symptoms of PTSD, including irritability, hypervigilance, insomnia, and more. The key is that trauma is a biological injury and should be treated as such. \n\nI recently published a book on DSR called The Invisible Machine. Written in partnership with one of my patients, Jamie Mustard, it weaves hard science with moving patient stories in an effort to change society\u2019s understanding of PTSD. \n\nTW: I will be discussing subjects including trauma, mental illness and PTSD. Take care when engaging with this content.\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/6j6pnpN)!\n\nEdit: Thank you for all of your questions so far! Unfortunately, I need to step away from Reddit for a bit, but I'll try to answer any other questions that come in throughout the day.",

Second, although SGB has been recommended for use as an adjuvant for other therapies,53 evidence is insufficient to support recommendations about specifically when to initiate SGB in the order of recommended conventional pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies.\n\nand\n\n&gt;Findings from the first RCT of SGB for PTSD were inconclusive, neither confirming nor refuting findings of rapid and high rates of clinically relevant improvement and low risk of serious adverse events from unblinded, uncontrolled case series. It is appropriate to listen to criticism of the RCT, envision a better study of SGB for PTSD, and investigate whether SGB should be a higher priority than other innovative treatments for PTSD.",

So it\u2019s no surprise THEY CHARGE $2,000 PER TREATMENT!!!\n(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200512005219/en/Sterling-Partners-and-its-Incubator-%E2%80%9987-Partner-with-Stella-Center-for-Trauma-Symptom-Care)\n\nPrivate equity investments in healthcare generally have a well developed playbook;\n\n1: find a charismatic personality to organize the main brand around. (The Dr. above)\n2: make unbelievable promises about a novel intervention that you can gain IP protections on. (Creating a functional monopoly on the service.) \n3: undercut existing services for complex cases. Offer payers (i.e insurance) a quick fix to drive total reimbursement for a case down. By having a monopoly on the practice, this sets you up for 4\u2026\n4: gain a price-setting (ie, monopolistic) position in the given market. You can now gouge everyone once you\u2019ve achieved scale by charging exorbitant rates.\n5: keep as many patients as possible in your own care \u201cecosystem\u201d, so you can drive profit by always referring back to the most profitable treatments. For instance, keep them in house for counseling so therapists can refer back to this DSR treatment. Instead of the therapist generating, say, $120/week in billings, now you\u2019re generating that plus $2,000/3 weeks for a simple injection. So roughly $800/week instead. \n\nIn addition, private equity LOVES specialists like anesthesiologists because the profit margins on those services in particular are immense. They are much less interested in proven, traditional interventions like trauma therapy, because of the timeline and slimmer margins.\n\nSource: see \u201cEthically Challenged\u201d by Laura Katz Olson for an overview of private equity in healthcare. 2022\n\n\u201cA Dirge for Academic medicine\u201d by boysen et Al 2021\n\n\u201cSoaring Private Equity Investment in the healthcare sector\u201d by  Scheffler et Al, 2021\n\nNews Source: https://www.commondreams.org/news/private-equity-healthcare\n\nSee Eileen Applebaums work in Counterpunch and Institute for New Economic Thinking\n\n\n\nSource: I\u2019m an economic anthropologist and clinical trauma expert who works in health policy and trauma treatment.

A good sign of a scam is that I can\u2019t find, anywhere, a population that they claim this treatment is contraindicated for. (For example, the trauma modalities I\u2019m trained in are contraindicated for the homeless, since digging up trauma doesn\u2019t work when someone doesn\u2019t have shelter, or food, or is being actively victimized.) No treatment works for every patient. Period.\n\nPrivate Equity demands VERY large returns on investment to justify themselves as a better investment class than the general stock market, since your dollars are \u201clocked in\u201d for a number of years. (Think somewhere around 20% plus). Vs the stock market, which is highly liquid. To meet that goal, they have to do really shady shit.",

(Charismatic founder, established training protocols, very brandable.)\n\nIn the mental health sector, most PE activity is going into residential/hospitals and drug-assisted therapies like ketamine infusion, methadone, what OP does, etc. There's also a decent bit of activity in Eating Disorder residential and intensive outpatient treatment due to the relatively high reimbursement rates.\n\nTo me, TRE seems like that more classic mental health scam of taking a seed of something true (mindfulness/meditation/exercise + therapeutic presence) and spinning it out into its own copyrighted system to make more money for the founder. In my MSW program, our clinical professors used to joke that if you wanted to make a living in mental health, invent a patented treatment modality.",

PM is about prescribing treatments based on molecular features of patients. Usually, PM trials are non-randomized and single-arm. If i remember right something like 40% of oncology approvals in past 10-15-whatever years have been through such trial designs. And they are even more common in ongoing trials.\n\nof course, regulators, like FDA/EMA/etc, kindly ask for post-marketing surveillance in these cases, ie phase 4 trials. So, an intervention is already available, but its clinical benefits relative to the standard of care are unknown. They are unknown because in non-randomized, single-arm trials you actually cannot measure clinical benefits for patients due to not having a control arm and a ton of other issues. To work around it, all sorts of surrogate endpoints are used, eg for solid tumors, you'd see if they are shrinking or not, instead of measuring how much longer patients live on the new therapy, ie overall survival.\n\nthis is a problem, because we get all these fancy drugs in oncology based on whatever PROTAC-mRNAvaccine-monoclonalCheckpoint-blah, but then, they work worse than the 70 year old chemotherapy. And that happens OFTEN, i dont wanna make up numbers, but easy for &gt;50% newly approved cancer drugs.\n\ntldr yes you can write a lot of books before doing RCTs",

Flexibility in several of your points above including surrogate outcomes has also supported funding as well as genuinely rapid development of potentially transformative or curative drugs including cell and gene therapies. Now, there's no judgement as to whether this investment is well spent compared with what else could be funded. But certainly, people can and do benefit from recent innovations.\n\nEdit: Some points above don't apply to this post about PTSD of course so it's slightly off topic. As critical as this might sound, regardless of the intention or study results linked by OP, the manner and quality of some of OP responses is slightly disappointing from a scientific perspective.",

The theory is if a person is sedated following a trauma, their brain does not have time to build up its response to the stress, and that process is unlikely to occur later when the person is remembering the event. If you interrupt the processing of a trauma by sedating someone immediately, that processing essentially stops and doesn\u2019t start again later. It\u2019s interesting stuff.",

It would be incredible if we could prevent some of the more predictable trauma scenarios.   \nThe cases where we see the most benefit are unfortunately based on a series of events, lifetime, abuse etc. So direct intervention would not be possible. This can kick the fight or flight system out of being \"stuck\" in hyper arousal.   \nThe physical symptoms of trauma are decrease so the trauma can be processed when we can't prevent it.",

We send out core measures (PCL-5, GAD-7, PHQ-9, all of which are considered standard by the DSM) when evaluating whether a person is a good candidate for the DSR treatment \u2013 and then 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days and 365 days after treatment. Based on the thousands of procedures I\u2019ve done, I have seen long-term benefits in a large percentage. \r  \n\r  \nBut I of course understand how important clinical data is to demonstrating the credibility of this approach. In addition to the peer-reviewed studies published in the other thread, we are currently conducting a clinical trial in partnership with NYU\u2019s Langone Health, the results of which will outline the longer-lasting benefits of the treatment. That data should be peer-reviewed and published in the coming months, and I\u2019d be happy to update this thread with it when it\u2019s live.",

So I do find it disturbing that your responses seem to confuse your personal clinical experiences (which I am not doubting) with high quality reported clinical data. There are several other responses that are together fairly concerning or at least surprising if you are indeed a HCP - mainly because there are so many other better alternative ways that you could have responded.\n\nI would encourage you to reflect on your style of responses from a medical ethics perspective and consider changing your style to focus on transparency, confidence and credibility. You could have strategically avoided a lot of skepticism here.\n\nEdit: So as to avoid any misunderstandings here, I do think the above comments are fair and here are some examples (not comprehensive or in any order)\n- Strange to confuse clinical experience with clinical trial evidence (good reporting practice would be to differentiate that clearly especially to potential patients)\n- Strange not to provide citations or references on questions regarding adverse events, this feels disingenuous although the information you provided was clear and helpful \n- Odd that the NCT for phase 4 study suggests preliminary results in 2024 but you're suggesting it'll be published soon (not even sure if that's the one you're recently referring to; and if not, well, this is one reason why providing NCT ID is good practice)\n- The confidence in speaking to questions about \"long term results\" etc while not having assessed this in a trial setting can be misleading, if not concerning as real patients rely on quality information \n- Signposting to your own call center in several cases feels like undue marketing (even a short statement as to why you're choosing to respond that way would feel better)\n- It is generally odd to \"not know\" about potential access in the EU (would be better to comment on not being able to comment, or to say this is not within your remit to know about, or provide a reason why you don't know such as it's too early to say)",

When your fight-or-flight response is stuck in an overactive state, your body is constantly experiencing a high level of stress which can be due to an imaginary threat. For example, it can feel like you\u2019re being chased by an imaginary bear. DSR SGB does not take your ability to run away from the bear. Instead, it removes the imaginary bear. Should a real bear appear, you will still instinctually run away from it.\n\n\\-Dr. Lipov",

I can handle all the dysregulation and disassociation I suffer from.  I am a master of avoidance and no longer work or leave my house for anything besides treatment.  That, I also do not mind, but the Somatic features will probably be the death of me.  Very painful.  Just horrible.  \n\nI am currently in treatment doing EMDR.  I am also medicated for depression, nightmares, insomnia, and pain for the somatic features.  Non Narcotic; Gabapentin 2400mgs a day.   I have become a student of mental illness just trying to make sense of my own.  \n\nAnyway, enough oversharing.  I have spoken to several psychiatrists and therapists and most give me the same reply, that EMDR will help me but the Somatic Features that I experience will probably never stop.    And that is hard for me to accept because I am also having trouble accepting that my somatic symptoms are being caused by my own mind.  \n\nWhat are your thoughts on Somatic Features?  Is it possible to \"cure\" them?  What are the best therapies for them that someone that no longer has income or insurance?  (I currently go to a clinic that is based on your income so my options are rather limited.)  \n\nAnd finally:  How does one sign up for trials on programs like this to hopefully recover?  I would do absolutely anything to be mostly functional at this point.  How does one find out where to apply to be a human guinea pig?  \n\nThank You Very Much!",

As you likely know, PTSD (and CPTSD) occurs when prolonged or repeated trauma activates the brain\u2019s \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d response and gets it stuck in overdrive, causing extreme physical and psychological symptoms including anxiety, insomnia, hypervigilance, headaches, and more.  \r  \n\r\r  \nThe DSR treatment administers two doses of local anesthetic into a bundle of nerves on the side of the neck (the Stellate Ganglion), helping regulate the overactive sympathetic nervous and resetting the \u201cflight-or-flight\u201d response back to its original baseline state. This helps to alleviate or completely eliminate PTSD symptoms. According to my research, this procedure results in 81% of clients finding relief from their PTSD symptoms.",

You would need to weigh the efficacy of the two since they are different treatments.\n\nThis is symptomatic treatment however if the sympathetic system can be reset to its pre trauma state it can help to reduce the symptoms for a prolonged amount of time. It's trauma so it's different than an infection that can be cured with an antibiotic. If someone experiences the trauma again there is a chance that PTSI can come back.\n\nThe time between if it's a new trauma vs an old trauma has not been studied yet. I have treated a patient who was a veteran from the Vietnam war, he received his treatment 50 years later and the results worked amazingly for him.\n\nWe shared my method widely throughout the US, it's also being done in Israel and Australia currently.\n\n\\- Dr. Lipov",

After SGB, patients temporarily experience various symptoms on the right side of the body including a droopy, bloodshot eye, warmth in the face and arm, and congestion. Usually, symptoms last 6-8 hours, but in some cases, they last up to 24 hours.

Such as the PTSD's origin being from a military deployment and being shelled, and it remaining after returning to civilian life, where being shelled isn't really a danger anymore.\n\nHowever, that is not always the case.  Sometimes the risk level of the traumatic event's recurrence has NOT decreased.\n\nImagine a professor who refused to sleep with a student in exchange for increasing a student's grade.  She then creates a false accusation against the professor.  He manages to beat the false accusation, but not after having gone through a difficult process, developing PTSD in the process.  Here's the thing though, unlike the soldier example above, the risk is equally as likely now.\n\nSo to my question:\n\nWould the treatment be effective in the professor's case, as well as the soldier's case?",

Or tell us who is following you?\n\nFew companies are real leaders,e.g. Coca Cola is one. Lots of other companies try to mimick their product. Or in Germany, Aldi is a leader: other discounters matches the prices Aldi sets.Aldi changes, the others follow suit one or two days later.\n\nFew, very few, companies are leaders. And usually they don't have to stress this fact. And none is emerging, an emerging leader is IMHO an oxymoron.\n\nOr did you mean leadership in the hollow marketing sense, where everyone is trying to boost itself? But how should we trust you then?",

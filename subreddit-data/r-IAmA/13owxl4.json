    "postText": "Hey guys, I am Doug Christie. I have traded all kinds of commodities in all parts of the world including multiple roles with Cargill.  I am now the author of a monthly [series](http://ag.hedder.com/) *Agricultural Commodities Focus*. Here is my [bio](https://www.hedder.com/fellows/doug-christie).  \n   \nI am keen on all things agricultural and food-related, and can answer anything about trade flow, industry trends, supply chain, futures market etc. Some of the questions that people like to ask me include:\n\n* How much influence does agribusiness have on government policymaking? How do they lobby?\n* With population growing all the time, won\u2019t we run out of food eventually?\n* How do geopolitics come into play in the sector?\n* Can institutional and corporate players corner the commodities market and manipulate price?\n* How does agricultural commodities trading impact global food prices and access to affordable food?\n* Does agricultural commodities trading contribute to market volatility and price speculation?\n* How does the dominance of large-scale traders in agricultural commodities affect small-scale farmers?\n\nMy Proof: https://postimg.cc/MXvWWWDX  \n   \nYou can compare the photo against my LinkedIn, Doug Christie.  \n   \nI\u2019ll start answering questions from 2pm ET today. If you want to dig deeper on the subject of ag, here\u2019s a [list](https://ag.hedder.com/read-list-for-agribusiness-pro/) of publicly available resources that could be useful.",

Protects our social license to operate in the meantime.\n\n* Externally.. we're producing food in ancient ways updated for modern times, here's your burger in balance with nature etc etc\n\nPersonally I think lots of the practices are sound, historically tested and sensible (crop rotations! not ruining soil!) but there's a lot of thought and effort being expended in data, monitoring and technology when the systemic fundamentals are still kinda fucked\n\nWe've consolidated food production in the hands of large corporations who want to apply a relatively homogeneous template to intensely produce lots of very similar food for lots of people across the world in a very profitable way. \n\nA more sensible future should include protecting soil and reducing inputs but it also means adapting what we all eat, decentralising food production, reintroducing variety and giving a producers a fair share of income and the agency to adapt to a volatile growing climate that's already properly fucked in parts of the world and rapidly getting more fucked and fast\n\nTo answer your question, there's some positive in that large food businesses do recognise now that you can save money and the planet too in theory, but _real_ change doesn't come from the people who benefit the most from things staying as they are. \n\nMore specifically, Cargill et al as profit making entities have most of the power but fuck all incentive to end deforestation and its contribution to climate change.\n\n/rant",

Meat *is* much more expensive to raise, but the meat industry is a powerful lobby and they've acquired massive subsidies. The cost for \"cheap\" pork and chicken comes out of your taxes as much as your grocery bill. So their prices stay artificially *low* while other sticker prices go up.\n\nGrocery prices are also wonky in that whole categories of goods are normally sold at a financial loss, such as milk, bananas, and cooked chicken. Grocery stores slash prices on these \"loss leaders\" to get customers in the door, and make up the shortfall (and then some) by charging more for everything else they sell. So you actually pay less for these items than it cost the farms to grow, or the store to buy it from them.",

Short is that due to global market dynamics the cost of inputs (fuel, fertilizer, labour) increases dramatically which knocks on to end cost. Spikes are more likely \"a bad winter\" or \"low rainfall\" constraining supply which compounds with the former.\n\nAs to why chicken prices aren't as affected, I'd speculate that they're artificially low, far less affected by seasonal shocks and have different inputs, but you're out of my area of expertise!\n\nEdit: local market matters too right? A store might (entirely made up numbers) accept that they can only make 1% on the fresh chicken breast you've come in for, but 20% on the prepackaged mashed potatoes you're having with it, this is that \"woolier\" factor I mentioned. Overall a supermarket retailer isn't making huge bank on a given product, net profit margins in the low single digit are pretty common, they just sell a staggering fuckload of food",

Onions that are starting to rot in a layer or two, or digging through a box of onions and they are all soft. One store seems to only have garlic that is beginning to sprout, another only carries weirdly large garlic that has a fraction of the flavor of regular garlic - not sure if it's a different variety or just grown/picked poorly. A whole box of potatoes that are all sprouting or all green. Often, all brussel sprouts will be soft, or all the limes brown. And this is from 3 stores I visit, so it's not just one shitty buyer.\n\nI know this could be mis-perception on my part, but I know that 5 years ago, I didn't have to think about root vegetables - they weren't good or bad quality, they just were.",

Cargill is the owner of numerous large scale factory animal farms that are known to pollute animal waste into rivers and use water intensive corn and alfalfa (that they themselves grow under the Cargill label) to feed the animals. It uses more water than almonds and avocados. As long as they profit, they aren\u2019t going to do anything. Many politicians are supported by or are investors in such companies and help increase subsidies for the large corporations. This is why meat, milk, and corn oil costs less than say olive oil, almond oil, or produce. As an investor, OP has everything to lose if climate change is made serious bc these companies would need to descale or shut down entirely for genuine impact. What they will do for climate change is greenwashing their products, essentially the marketing baseless claims they always make",

Science however is the innovation that businesses use to direct their investments. When science comes up with new ways and methods of producing equivalent goods or better at equivalent cost or cheaper businesses respond. If we really want to stop deforestation we need to figure out how to make deforestation a disadvantage. Increasing crop yields for example would result in a decrease in deforestation.

Never in my time have I ever seen \"a problem that isn't a problem yet\" become a priority unless the potential for liability exists.  Unfortunately, no matter how wrong it feels, it doesn't move businesses.  They chase profits and deal with problems as they come up.  They can't respond to every \"problem, that isn't a problem yet\" even though it's a 100% certainty.  There are small businesses who are taking steps however.  Know that for the most part, on the smaller scale, people agree with you.  Owners, presidents, vice presidents, etc... they WANT an alternative.  But at the minute there's no incentive because it's often cost prohibitive and the change towards sustainability often makes another business more competitive by foregoing sustainability, which hurts the business focusing on sustainability - promotes the business foregoing sustainability, and the net result is that there's no real change in sustainability.\n\nThe method is, as you mentioned, to innovate and regulate our way out of it.  Trade makes the world go around and it's impossible to get away from the buying and selling of assets.  While commodities traders aren't blameless, they're also not the reason for deforestation as that's a business rather than a product",

I have no clue where any capital in this situation is coming from except for some people betting A and other people betting B. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re so sure a movie is going to bomb, either just make a bet with friends or short the production company\u2026 both sound more logical to me.",

Granted, insurance for non-irrigated land has always been very low (~$0.50/ ac), and is somewhat negligible cost-wise.\n\nEquipment insurance has more or less gone up in tandem with equipment costs. That is not surprising, and it is expensive. Still, that\u2019s not anywhere near a 300% increase. Maybe 15-20% over the last three years. \n\nCrop insurance has not shifted much. It\u2019s value moves in tandem with the margin a farmer might expect to see, but with a handful of exceptions I have not seen much movement in premiums. Interestingly, hale insurance for the high plains has come up about 15%, perhaps due to an increase in incidents.\n\nWhat has farmers worried is the increase in input costs. Anhydrous, a key component of commercial fertilizer, is now ~$1,200/ ton versus $400/ ton in 2019. \n\nI recently read an analysis that put the breakeven price of 2023 corn production in the Corn Belt at $5.15-$5.50/ bu. With post-harvest corn futures currently at ~$5.18/ bu, this is extremely concerning.",

Do you think any major shifts will need to be made in order to facilitate these changes, or is it likely that the average consumer won\u2019t even notice anything different in the coming decades?\n\nLastly, sort of in line with the previous questions, have you been witness to any revolutionary changes or big mess-ups in the industry that absolutely rocked your world?

What is their trading style - is it to take physical delivery or simply to make money in the ebbs and flows, I'd assume both?  Secondly Would you say there's much of a difference between trading to actually take physical delivery than simply to make a profit?  What types of trading styles do you employ?  Any order flow, algorithmic, etc... or is it more of a directive that you need to hold X number of contracts and attempt to get them under $X.XXX?\n\nWhat's your favorite market to trade and why that market?\n\nWhat was the hardest time or trade you've ever been a part of?

Cargill participates in most of the widely traded ag commodities (wheat, corn, soy, cotton, cocoa, palm) but not in all - coffee and rice for example.   I would describe ABCD firms  as physical players who use futures markets to manage risk and capitalize on trading opportunities.   These firms all have major investments in infrastructure (people, facilities and equipment) to support what they do in the supply chain.  For me as a trader, I would describe my approach as blend of fundamental and technical analysis but with a much shorter time horizon than a firm who trades larger positions and handles physical product.  I think the  soy and cotton markets are best suited to applying that approach - liquid with a good mix of tech and fundamental participation.",

What thoughts do you have on using flexi vs iso or drums/ibc or whatever?\n\nETA: tbh that's a pretty light question and not a good one. I struggle knowing what to ask despite having a very big part in how some of this commodity moves. I think part of that is because I genuinely struggle to make ends meet while an ama like this reminds me how much money these things I have handled are making some people. It's wild, frustrating, and I don't even know where to begin with my feelings and interest.",

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.",

That might mean actual futures or utilizing customized OTC products that use averages or min/max prices to manage risk. Those products may have a cost but can be easier for some firms than managing margin calls and accounting for a futures position.",

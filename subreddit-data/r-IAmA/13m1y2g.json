    "postText": "Yo! It\u2019s been a little while since I did one of these. My name is Marques Brownlee, you might know me from my tech videos on YouTube as [MKBHD](http://youtube.com/MKBHD) (for the past 14 years). I\u2019m also a professional [ultimate frisbee](https://theaudl.com/empire) player, golfer and newly minted car enthusiast. \n\nI\u2019ve also had quite a few crazy experiences since last time we chatted in 2020 - I got to collaborate with [Sesame Street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I85gpjErUVw&amp;t=803s) and I launched my own sneaker (4 days left to get em [here](http://atoms.com/251))\n\nI got a few hours to hang out. Ask me anything!\n\n**My Proof:** https://i.imgur.com/ctJAN35.jpeg\n\nEdit: Alright, I'm heading out now. Thank you all for the questions, this has been really fun! (hit me up on Twitter anytime)",

Started with Spanish because it's the second most common language spoken by MKBHD viewers. And the way it works is actually pretty slick, if you live in the right region, and you pull up an MKBHD video it's automatically subtitled and subbed and you'll a Spanish voice throughout the video. It's not cheap to pay for these services, but hopefully this helps the video be more accessible",

It starts off expensive and for the early adopters and it slowly gets better and better until it reaches the inflection point of being good enough and cheap enough that the masses can get use out of it... AI just feels like it skipped a few steps. The curve is very different. It's a little frightening sometimes.",

By editing these comments, it provides reddit and other websites that 'scrape' reddit for data with less information than it had before, therefore ruining the website in the process. Reddit is refusing to work with third party app/client developers which is causing reddit to 'digg' their own grave. If you found this post on the internet while searching for a problem that someone may have had before, just remember that reddit (specifically u/spez) caused this for you.\n\nThanks for nothing u/spez.\n\nAlso remember that the official reddit app is infested with ads that users do NOT want to see.\n\nFor more information, please look at https://redd.it/13ws4w3",

This year I followed a program that had me lifting 5 days a week and playing indoor winter league (New Jersey is cold) once a week. That's just build the strength foundations, recover from injuries, etc etc. Pretty classic.\n\nIn-season is a little more tricky because I play for both a pro team (Empire) and an overlapping club team (PoNY). So lifting is reduced to either 1 or 0 days per week, depending on how many practices/games stack up. This past week was Saturday night game, Sunday practice, Monday rest, Tuesday lift, Wednesday practice, Thursday practice, Friday cardio, Saturday game, Sunday practice. Pretty constant until November.",

Obviously Linus's production/company's scale is absolutely gigantic  and the style is more \"assembly line\" that cranks out videos... but the start we both had is similar: Small group interested in making videos grows into large group. Our job goes from \"creative person making videos with a team\" to \"manager of a team.\" There's no textbook or blueprint for how to move forward with this stuff, but my move has always been to do what makes the most sense. There's a world where sometime in the future I need to consider a \"CEO\" that isn't myself. So I can keep the focus on making videos.",

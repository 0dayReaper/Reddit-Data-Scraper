    "postText": "I\u2019m excited to be back for my fifth AMA. \n\n\nMelinda and I recently published our latest Annual Letter: http://www.gatesletter.com.\n\n\nThis year it\u2019s addressed to our dear friend Warren Buffett, who donated the bulk of his fortune to our foundation in 2006. In the letter we tell Warren about the impact his amazing gift has had on the world.\n\n\nMy idea for a David Pumpkins sequel at Saturday Night Live didn't make the cut last Christmas, but I thought it deserved a second chance: https://youtu.be/56dRczBgMiA.\n\n\n**Proof:** https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/836260338366459904\n\n\n**Edit:** Great questions so far. Keep them coming: http://imgur.com/ECr4qNv\n\n\n**Edit:** I\u2019ve got to sign off. Thank you Reddit for another great AMA. And thanks especially to: https://youtu.be/3ogdsXEuATs\n\n\n",

I felt sure that allowing anyone to publish information and making it easy to find would enhance democracy and the overall quality of political debate.

It would seem strange to have to force people to look at ideas they disagree with so that probably isn't the solution. We don't want to get to where American politics partitions people into isolated groups. I am interested in anyones suggestion on how we avoid this.",

Government and the private sector are the big players so philanthropy has to be more innovative and fund pilot programs to help the other sectors. A good example is funding new medicines or charter schools where non-obvious approaches might provide the best solution.\n\nOne thing that is a challenge for our Foundation is that poor countries often have weak governance - small budgets, and the people in the ministries don't have much training. This makes it harder to get things done.\n\nIf we had more money we could do more good things - even though we are the biggest foundation we are still resource limited.\n\n**Edit:** We discuss this in our annual letter this year: www.gatesletter.com",

If the latter, what methods would you recommend for people to develop and stimulate their own curiosity?",

A lot of people lose their curiosity as they get older which is a shame. One thing that helps nowadays is that if you get confused about something it is easier than ever to find an article or video to make things clear.",

In fact you've said that the\u00a0diseases\u00a0malaria and polio could be\u00a0eradicated\u00a0within the next 15 years, with polio gone as soon as 2019. I'd like to know which other deadly diseases that you think could be either 100% curable affordably or gone completely by 2050? \n\nAnd one more thing, you have said previously that you think AI can pose a serious threleat to humanity. I'd like to ask, apart from a killswitch, which other precautionary measures we could take to ensure that AI behaves well and doesn't wipe us out?,\n\nThanks a lot Mr. Gates! ",

For example the idea of looking at a blood sample to find cancer very early so it can be treated. We will be able to use genomic data to tune treatments.\n\nThere are a few big problems like diabetes, obesity and neurological conditions including Alzheimer's that we really need to solve.",

They make enough money through the insane costs to pay others to do all the \"tedious\" tasks that most software automates. \n\nOur product would basically do a huge data search on opt-in patients, give them personal quizzes broken down into small questions per day, and we'd have subtle depression screenings that you couldn't tell were depression screenings (most elderly people don't self medicate because they are depressed and won't admit it). It would then automatically apply certain actions to help them self-medicate and it would send notes / make suggestions for the doctors/nurses in the system. It was incredible tech with a huge machine learning backend, had the potential to help save tons of lives.\n\nAnd every single time I'd go meet with a healthcare system, their executives first and only question was, \"how can this save us money?\" I'd look around at their new $20 million dollar office, the executive's several thousand dollar suits, and just wonder, \"why in the hell do they need more money?\" \n\nWhen I'd go visit the sites where people's EHR (electronic health records) data was stored, they'd have ancient hardware running in basements plugged into 5 daisy chained surge protectors. It's completely insane. There are no standards to anything, no universally stored data, and nobody's EHR/EMR systems are compatible. \n\nThere are entire companies like [redox](https://www.redoxengine.com/) who do nothing other than normalize data from healthcare systems and send it through APIs. To get your software to plug into just 1 EMR/EHR system is $500 per month minimum (can easily get into $50k/month for complicated ones). Considering there are literally hundreds of EMR/EHR systems out there, you can see how making a compatible product can be insanely expensive. This makes innovation expensive and unlikely. \n\nAnd it's because the system is for-profit. Just like we're seeing now in late stage capitalism in general, lots of companies are running out of ways to squeeze money out of people. They've been slowly taking every penny they can, and now finally they are just cutting out as much as they can while trying to maintain the status quo. \n\nUntil healthcare has motivations that go beyond money, we will NEVER have the medical technology we need or deserve.

I recently read 2017 annual letter in response to Warren Buffet on the impact of his donation (2006) to your foundation, and the world it serves, and I thought the information you highlighted was incredibly powerful and insightful. For those of us that cannot start our own foundation, or even if we could, how do you recommend finding a cause worth fighting for? Clearly your access to information and resources has allowed you to isolate some of the world's larger problems and find those folks who can actually make a difference. But where did you start? (For those who haven't seen it- https://www.gatesnotes.com/2017-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_14_2017_02_AL2017GFO_GF-GFO_&amp;WT.tsrc=GFGFO)\n\nLastly, can I ask for your opinion on the status of the world refugee crisis. I've seen a lot of information on both sides of the fence, but I think I lean towards the belief that charity/donations need go into these communities and the folks that relocate are often the top thinkers/earners that could truly change their home country if they stayed. Here is a rather oversimplified video that summarizes the basis of my thoughts, I'd love to hear your view on all of this. (Poverty/refugee by numbers- https://youtu.be/LPjzfGChGlE)\n\nThanks again for taking the time. You truly are a visionary, role model, and hero without a cape to many of us worldwide.\n\nEdit: formatting",

I think most people start getting involved in local social service organizations. If you can travel to developing countries and see the needs there that is also great. It is great to start philanthropy when you are young.\n\nIn the long run the way to avoid refugee problems is to help countries develop by having good health, education and governance - fortunately the overall trend is good despite huge setbacks like Syria, South Sudan and Somalia. Unicef has a lot of good information about how to help with the current refugee challenges: http://uni.cf/2ltdjfr\n",

            "comment": "Bill, my father (Dr. William Halford) has developed a live attenuated vaccine for HSV-1 and HSV-2 that is not only preventative but can also reduce shedding (lowering transmission rates) and the frequency of outbreaks amongst those who already have it. Furthermore, people who have HSV-1 and HSV-2 are over 3x as likely to contract HIV. Currently, the regulatory nature of the FDA has created such high barriers to entry that only the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical players would be able to push through a vaccine (the approval process costs 100+M). However, with a 4B+ annual market in a drug called Valtrex (which only handles outbreaks but does not prevent transmission), the large players are not incentivized to create a cure or vaccine for HSV-1/HSV-2. Instead, they have been pushing subunit vaccines (viruses that are so heavily attenuated that the body is unable to produce a long lasting immune response; these failed trials centered around the same failed approach maintain their profits in drugs that keep those who suffer at bay rather than giving them a lifelong solution). Billions of people carry HSV-1/HSV-2 and tens of millions suffer from lifelong outbreaks. \n\nThe company that the therapeutic/preventative vaccine is being tested under is called Rational Vaccines. They have recently conducted Phase 1 trials internationally and have seen profound results in the mitigation of symptoms in people with extreme cases of HSV-2.\n\nUltimately, a live attenuated HIV vaccine will likely be the path to eradication of the disease. This was the method employed for the polio and chickenpox vaccines. However, the attenuation of the polio, smallpox, chickenpox vaccines was random rather than by design, making it risky if the virus reverted to its original form..this resulted in the infection of 1 in ~100,000 vaccine recipients, but this was because the virus was attenuated in one site and would, in rare case, mutate back to its oringal Wild type form. My father's approach attenuates the HSV-1/HSV-2 viruses in multiple locations while still leaving it 99.7% intact. Since it is attenuated in multiple locations the odds of the virus reverting to its dangerous form are 1 in 100,000^3, meaning that practically no one who received his vaccine would be infected. The risk pales in comparison to the millions of people who contract HSV-1 and HSV-2 every year.\n\nSo Bill, is there a way that you could look into my father's work and help guide progress in the clinical trials/approval of the vaccine? Your foundation has the potential to make that impact.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!",

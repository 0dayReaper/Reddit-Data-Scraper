In the meantime, I like to be known as a global space statesman. \n\n**This July 20th is the 45th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing.** Everywhere in the world that I visit, people tell me stories of where they were the day that Neil Armstrong and I walked on the moon.\n\nToday, we are launching a social media campaign which includes a YouTube Channel, #Apollo45. This is a channel where you can share your story, your parents', your grandparents', or your friends' stories of that moment and how it inspires you, with me and everyone else who will be watching. \n\nI do hope you consider joining in. Please follow along at [youtube.com/Apollo45](http://www.youtube.com/Apollo45). \n\nVictoria from reddit will be assisting me today. Ask me anything.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TheRealBuzz/status/486572216851898368\n\n**Edit**: Be careful what you dream of, it just may happen to you. Anyone who dreams of something, has to be prepared.  Thank you!",

                    "comment": "I have watched many movies from martians coming to Earth in New Jersey in the form of giant snakes - this was a radio program created by Orson Welles, War of the Worlds - and I've read many science fiction stories, descriptions, by Isaac Asimov, but my favorite of course is Arthur C. Clarke. So 2001: A Space Odyssey. And then later on, I managed to arrange a cruise ship departing from Sri Lanka where Clarke lived, and I was able to stay with him, talking about many, many things in the past. I wrote a book along with Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins, called First on the Moon, and the epilogue was written by Arthur C. Clarke. When I wrote *my* book of science fiction, Arthur C. Clarke wrote a one page forward that was OUTSTANDING, absolutely, as he praised our ingenuity and imagination. And when we visited, we talked about a treasure he had discovered in the ocean, and we both hoped in the future that he and I could scuba dive and perhaps retrieve some of that treasure. That never happened, unfortunately.\n\n I thought that the movie Gravity, the depiction of people moving around in zero gravity, was really the best I have seen. The free-falling, the actions that took place between two people, were very, I think, exaggerated, but probably bent the laws of physics. But to a person who's been in space, we would cringe looking at something that we hoped would NEVER, EVER Happen. It's very thrilling for the person who's never been there, because it portrays the hazards, the dangers that could come about if things begin to go wrong, and I think that as I came out of that movie, I said to myself and others, \"Sandra Bullock deserves an Oscar.\"",

But it is also desolate - there is no place on earth as desolate as what I was viewing in those first moments on the Lunar Surface.\n\nBecause I realized what I was looking at, towards the horizon and in every direction, had not changed in *hundreds, thousands* of years. Beyond me I could see the moon curving away - no atmosphere, black sky. Cold. Colder than anyone could experience on Earth when the sun is up-  but when the sun is up for 14 days, it gets very, very hot. No sign of life whatsoever.\n\nThat is desolate. More desolate than any place on Earth. ",

We knew this would be different because 2 people would be going out. There was a group at NASA who felt the junior person (me) should go out first, but many people felt the great symbology of the commander from past expeditions or arrivals at a destination. The decision that was made was absolutely correct as far as who went out first, symbolically. However who was in charge of the what happened after both people are outside, I believe, could have been done differently. I was not the commander, I was a junior person, so once both were outside, I followed my leader, because we (NASA) had not put together detailed jobs of people outside. I believe it could have been improved. But it was very successful for what it was. And the decision wasn't up to me, or Neil, it was up to people much higher up in NASA. ",

But I was very disappointed when it looked like I wouldn't even have a chance to fly in the two-man Gemini program! I was not scheduled to be anything other than the back up crew. A tragedy changed that, and I was a backup pilot on Gemini 9, and then I would be on the primary crew for Gemini 12, the final mission. The #1 air force experiment was on Gemini 9 and 12, but its use was unsuccessful on Gemini 9, and so I became the first astronaut to train underwater in neutral buoyancy. I had been a scuba diver 10 years earlier, and knew that training underwater would be very very effective, and I felt very confident of carrying out the difficult procedures to be able to free-maneuver outside the spacecraft with the equipment (this is what George Clooney's character was doing with the jetpack in Gravity) - unfortunately NASA cancelled that experiment.

It turns out that it was not a good thing to do, because it caused the platform to become locked, and we were not able to use the primary thrusters, the primary guidance, to control the spacecraft, to its final few feet to dock and join the other spacecraft. That was my mistake. I suggested to my commander that we do it differently, and it was his mistake to assume that i knew what I was talking about. So we both made mistakes - brought about by me! We recovered successfully on the \"abort guidance\" system. \n\n(I don't admit that to many people)\n\n(but I'm sure the mission controllers in Houston, while it was happening or certainly afterwards, they certainly knew what had happened, but fortunately they didn't squeal on us)",

It took an hour and a half just to sink down in the ocean about 2 miles deep to look out the thick glass window and see the Titanic. The visibility was such that we could see the bow, it became very famous in the movie thanks to James Cameron, but the visibility was not so good that you could actually see the bottom of the ocean that the Titanic was resting on. So it was an eerie site, of a ship festooned with rusting metal, like gingerbread. Floating, floating out the window in the Ocean. ",

The lack of funding that supported missions to the Moon and return, a pioneering effort for humanity, required 4% of the national budget of the United States. Now we are at 1/2 of 1% and have been that way for quite some while. To those of us that feel that America is a leader, it was, we helped win WWI, WWII, the Cold War, and we can lead the other nations in peace, just the way that the plaque on the moon that Neil and I left, \"We came in peace for all Mankind\" - I believe that that is so American, to do things, and share with other nations of the world. That's how we should go back to the Moon, not by competing with other nations, like China, to land our people - we've *done* that. The robotics, the operation of rovers and such at a great distance, has improved tremendously in the last 45 years. I don't believe the human mind has increased that much at all. So let the other nations of the world put their citizens on the surface of the moon for prestige - that is a major reason why nations put their people on the Moon. But we've done that, we can help the other nations, and we can help other nations use our facilities, and then we can deploy a radio telescope on Mars via balloon and design a strong suggestion for what the lunar base should be, on the near side &amp; the far side, we can help in the construction of those elements, and we can bring those elements that are landed by other countries (because they are heavy, expensive) - we can bring them together and then the interface between elements that will come together in a complicated way because this is in a gravity field with uneven terrain, it's not as simple as the space shuttle docking with the space station, or any spacecraft, and zero gravity, it's much much more difficult, it requires (from a distance) bringing them sufficiently close and aligning them so that the two interfaces from adjacent cylinders (that may be 20 feet in diameter, 30 feet long, vertically part of the the shared space onboard the base) and from each one of these 3 can emanate 2 different nations for a total of 6 different individual nations growing outward for their habitation and laboratories and to control robots on the surface, to establish a distinct presence and yet sharing with the other people who have their personnel and their astronauts or the front or back side. But that is the great contribution of the United States, technically, but it's not a contribution that requires great investment of money for big rockets, and sustaining people on the surface. \n\nReturning to the Moon with NASA astronauts is not the best usage of our resources. Because OUR resources should be directed to outward, beyond-the-moon, to establishing habitation and laboratories on the surface of Mars that can be built, assembled, from the close-by moons of Mars. With very little time delay - a second or less. Much better than controlling things on the Moon from the Earth. So when NASA funding comes up for review, please call your lawmakers to support it. ",

For lack of any serious government effort, I\u2019m rooting for Elon Musk to accomplish this by sending man to Mars. What advice would you give Elon to achieve the ultimate objective of permanence on Mars?\n",

And I expect that within 2 decades of the 5th anniversary of the first landing on the moon, that within 2 decades America will lead an international presence on Planet Mars. Some people may be rooting for Elon - I think he could, with his SpaceX, contribute considerably, enormously, to an international activity not only at the moon but also on Mars. I have considered whether a landing on Mars could be done by the private sector. It conflicts with my very strong idea, concept, conviction, that the first human beings to land on Mars should not come back to Earth. They should be the beginning of a build-up of a colony / settlement, I call it a \"permanence.\" A settlement you can visit once or twice, come back, and then decide you want to settle. Same with a colony. But you want it to be permanent from the get-go, from the very first. I know that many people don't feel that that should be done. Some people even consider it distinctly a suicide mission. Not me! Not at all. Because we will plan, we will construct from the moon of Mars, over a period of 6-7 years, the landing of different objects at the landing site that will be brought together to form a complete Mars habitat and laboratory, similar to what has been done at the Moon. Tourism trips to Mars and back are just not the appropriate way for human beings from Earth - to have an individual company, no matter how smart, send people to mars and bring them back, it is VERY very expensive. It delays the obtaining of permanence, internationally. Your question referred to a *monumental achievement by humanity* - that should not be one private company at all, it should be a collection of the best from all the countries on Earth, and the leader of the nation or the groups who makes a commitment to do that in 2 decades will be remembered throughout history, hundreds and thousands of years in the future of the history of humanity, beginning, commencing, a human occupation of the solar system.

So I held a camera up against the window to film the flames from the heat shield that was behind us, but foremost in the spacecraft, and the flames were going backwards, away from us, in the front, and I was holding the camera and taking photographs. The g-forces increased and I wasn't able to continue to hold the camera against the window, so I had to lay it back against my chest, but still continued to photograph the re-entry until there was no more unusual visual effects of the energy in the atmosphere. And it was very comforting to understand that the people in Houston, the controllers, had very high confidence that we were on the right path. And the right path means that as you enter the atmosphere, the lift of the spacecraft is down to be able to capture the trajectory from the moon, and once that is assured, that the spacecraft won't skip out, we now roll the spacecraft so the lift vector is up,  it's predicted by the computer, as basically a target, moving it up to where it now was exactly where we wanted it to be, and then we could roll the spacecraft so that it no longer had increasing lift in any direction but had zero lift, effectively, and we would guide it down to a point where we could then deploy automatically a device that would slow us down enough that then at 10,000 feet, the 3 parachutes would come out, a little lower the pressure of the atmosphere outside was greater than inside, and we could smell the salt air and it was very encouraging to return to earth.

So the parachutes pulled us over, and allowed the spacecraft to float upside-down rather than right side up. Now the engineers were very surprised in the early testing of the spacecraft in water to discover that it would float upside-down as well as right-side up. So they devised a system of inflating big balloons that would then turn the spacecraft right-side up. We had to do that. ",

In the Simpsons I played a role where I opened a bag of popcorn and it was all over the place. Bart Simpson said \"no no no! don't open that!\" The taste was generally pleasant. But it was mostly freeze-dried so we had to add water to the container and let it set - and around the instrument panel and other parts of the spacecraft, we had certain places we had velcro so we could attach things so we wouldn't have to hold onto each one or have it float around the cabin. We had to use a water gun to send water into the plastic bag with the freeze-dried food. Now later on, things got much better and they were more like TV dinners that I remember - I don't see too many these days - as long as the food has some stickiness to it, it won't float around, but if it is like M&amp;Ms, that are used in training with zero gravity, they're all over the place, and so would water form into spheres and float around in the cabin! So the crewman has to be very careful about adjusting to a lack of gravity sensation. We had *very* small shrimp that had a little bit of cocktail sauce, and when exposed to water, were very very tasty. But you wouldn't want a shrimp an inch long floating around the cabin!",

If you can swing it, one of the biggest things I did as a kid with my dad was we bought a little telescope (that by a teenager I knew better to use than him) and we puttered around the sky looking at things like the moon and Jupiter.  It amazed me that you could actually *see* the moons of Jupiter with your own eyes!\n\nThe second thing I remember from a young age (before I just got really into the subject myself and literally read every book in the school library on the topic) was in the 90s we had Comet Hyukatake and Comet Hale-Bopp grace our skies when I was in elementary school, and for both of them my dad took us out to the country to see them and tell us about them.  You can't order bright comets to show up for your son, of course, but you can take him to the planetarium or teach him little things about the sky- point out Venus if it's up at sunset, or look up when the space station passes above your home (it's bright and easy to find on the Internet!).  Astronomy is great because unlike many other kinds of science you can do it right in front of you in your backyard!\n\nI hope this helps- your little guy sounds like he's well on the way. :)",

Yes its a somewhat simple game, but it has taught me so much, and it demonstrated principles I thought I knew and opened my mind to a future of man in space beyond what we do today. \n\nThis enthusiasm and enlightenment needed to be shared with my younger siblings, and one of them, a 10 year old, just fell in love with it, he can do pretty much everything in it, things I still can't accomplish, and now he wants to be an engineer and pilot. We will spend hours on mumble discussing the cosmos, space flight, robots, and he surprises me often with insight that I thought I could never expect from his age. His ability to understand this stuff shocks me, because I never could comprehend these things as a child, and yet much of this new found knowledge he seeked out after playing hundreds of hours of KSP and watching Scott Manley. This experience and my experience as a child growing up with Bill Nye has taught me something, that those individuals who create content, entertainment, games based on teaching science and technology are as important as the scientists and explorers. They are the ones who motivate those greater individuals then myself and others when they are children, without them the best would probably become Lawyers or Accountants, not that there's anything wrong with those career choices.",

And I believe that that demonstration of the perseverance, the dedication, the depth of the industrial capacity of the United States went a long ways to convince Premier Gorbachev that the Soviet Union could not match - the announcement by President Reagan that we would develop a strategic defense initiative, branded by the media in a detrimental way, as \"Star Wars\" - it, I believe, was a major factor in the ending of the Cold War and the separation of the Satellite Nations around the U.S.S.R. It gave us peace. It reduced the Nuclear Weapon threat worldwide. \n\nSo we are now very interested in science, technology, engineering and math. When we went to the moon and thereafter shortly, we were number one, and I think that there are many children's books  - I have written 2 so far, and I have another one that is well underway on National Geographic that follows my adult book, Mission to Mars and my vision for space exploration. I think that reading to children will help inspire that interest in aerospace, and many other supporting career fields. Not everyone can be an astronaut and go into space, some people with sufficient resources can purchase and fly sub-orbitally thanks to various companies and for more money (considerably) fly into orbit. For a million dollars, the Russians would take two people, a million apiece, around the moon and back. However, stories, videos that come from the space station, and other people, are a great inspiration to young people for an exciting career field. ",

And I believe we should do that again, but we should have a robot slowly conserving fuel, so that in 1, or 2 years, get there just after a crew has arrived on the same asteroids. Combining those 2 without a human being, and with a human being, each has significant limitations but when those are put together, on the same asteroid, you are able to do much, much more for that mission in 2025, or 2026, or 2027, than the present mission that NASA and some of Congress and some of the President's office feel. So no - because I am needed here on earth to focus on opening up these opportunities, and also because the budget would not be there.",

I have the temperament and drive to be an astronaut or a SpaceX employee, but both of those areas are already flooded with applicants. The Mars Society has done some fantastic research, but most of their work is preliminary proof-of-concept stuff, and not equipment that could actually be taken to Mars. Robert Bigelow took an even more indirect approach, and spent his life earning as much money as he could, so that he could afford to fund space exploration. It\u2019s arguable that Sci-Fi authors inspire more real scientific work than they could ever have hoped to research themselves. What\u2019s the best approach?

There's a tremendous amount of stuff to learn, and I've only just scratched the surface. That said, here\u2019s the impression I\u2019ve gotten so far:\n\n* NASA is good for broadly pursuing a little bit of everything, but hasn't had the political drive to concentrate on any one goal since the Apollo program. The budget gets stretched pretty thin, so advancement is extremely slow.\n\n* Private companies are results driven, and so are much better at honing in on an objective. SpaceX is single mindedly pursuing rockets to Mars, and Biggelow Aerospace has already developed inflatable orbital habitats, but doesn\u2019t have funds to launch any full sized ones yet. It seems highly likely that these two companies will put a habitat on Mars.\n\n* That's not enough for a permanent colony, though. An occupied habitat would consume oxygen and food. After a couple years, they'd reach their lifetime radiation exposure limits. They can't have supplies and shielding constantly brought from earth. For this reason, I suspect that [in-situ resource utilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_situ_resource_utilization) is one of the most critical elements. This requires lots of energy, and although there have been many nuclear powered satellites, it's unlikely that Earthly laws regarding military technology will let the colonists bring even a small generator. This means lots and lots of solar panels, many of which would have to be manufactured on Mars.\n\nAlmost all of this is well outside of my area of expertise, but you might be interested in my current project. I'm working to compile [a page on the SpaceX subreddit's wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/wiki/colony) to give an overview of what research needs to be done. You may find some interesting tidbits tucked away there.\n\nPlease take everything you find there with a grain of salt, since it's a work in progress. In particular, what I've listed as the current status of each of these fields of research is only my current understanding, and is likely to change as I learn more. Feel free to take a look, but keep in mind that the page is very much under construction. I\u2019m adapting and expanding it from a post, so the last part is still in the original format and hasn\u2019t been tabulated.",

                    "comment": "I personally don't waste very much of my time on what is so obvious to a really thinking person, of all the evidence - we talked about Carl Sagan recently, who made a very prophetic observation. He said that \"extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence to make them believable.\" There is not extraordinary evidence of (as far as I know) all the claims that have been made that we did NOT go to the Moon. There are photographs from lunar reconnaissance orbiter satellites, going around the moon, that clearly show all of the experiments that we described when we came back from the moon, and they are evidence that we were there, telling the truth, you can even see a trail of Neil Armstrong's trek (not footprints really but the stirred up dust in walking or jogging behind him) to see the west Crater that we had flown over, that Neil was concerned about landing close to that - and he took photos of that and then he went back to the spacecraft. I was back inside the spacecraft at this time, but looking at the photos of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiters, you can clearly see the evidence of Neil's trek. And he took photographs, and all the signs are still there. Our flag in Apollo 11 was, without the doubt, the best looking flag that was stuck on the moon. But it was close to the spacecraft, so when we lifted off, Neil observed that the rocket exhaust caused the flag to strike the ground, to fall over. And by this time, I'm sure the radiation in space has deteriorated every piece of cloth on the flags, whether they are flying on the surface or standing up. We perhaps in the future will have very accurate rovers that can approach the different landing sites, and perhaps make available to people back on earth the ability to control a video scan, get out elevations, with floodlights to illuminate during the 14 days of darkness - I believe this will be very inspiring to people back here on earth, if we have the funds to do that, it would be great to do that.\n\nThe space suit had a soft interior to the shoes, and when the boots got put over the shoes, there is much cushioning effect, and the light weight due to the reduced gravity and the thickness of the dust, made it difficult to sense the feel of the surface. it was so remarkable, the way the bootprints were left, with such strong definition of the soil underneath, like moist talcum powder I guess, it keeps its shape, so I photographed before and after, pictures of the surface, and then I thought that looked a little lonely, so I put another bootprint down, and moved my foot a little bit so you could see my foot and the bootprint. \n\nI have since been told by a comic, by a humorist, what humor really is - but just as we were leaving the moon, I had given some thought to this, and I was able to create two achievements of humor in one sentence. \n\nWhen Mission Control said, to us, as we were about to leave \"Tranquility bass, you are cleared for liftoff,\" I responded by saying to them \"Roger, Houston, we are number one on the runway.\"\n\nThere wasn't anybody else for us to be 2, 3, 4 to! But there wasn't any runway up there either!\n\nIt's a phrase most pilots hear many times - \"Roger Tower, acknowledge we are number 3 for takeoff on the runway\" Because there are people waiting before us in an airplane to start take off. Pilots always get it. We are not going to roll ahead with increasing speed, we were going to lift off straight UP the way we left the earth!. ",

When he arrived, Sibrel was there demanding that he swear an oath on a Bible that he had walked on the Moon.\n\nWhen Aldrin refused, Sibrel called him 'a coward, and a liar, and a thief.' Aldrin punched Sibrel in the jaw, which was recorded. Sibrel later attempted to use the tape to convince police and prosecutors that he was the victim of an assault. However, it was decided that Aldrin had been provoked, and, based on Sibrel's unfazed, nearly instant reaction to his cameraman, did not actually injure Sibrel, so no charges were filed. Many talk shows aired the clip, often siding with Aldrin's response. Sibrel said later that he wrote a letter of apology to Aldrin.\"",

                    "comment": "On Apollo 11 in route to the Moon, I observed a light out the window that appeared to be moving alongside us. There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world - it was either the rocket we had separated from, or the 4 panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket and we were nose to nose with the two spacecraft. So in the close vicinity, moving away, were 4 panels. And i feel absolutely convinced that we were looking at the sun reflected off of one of these panels. Which one? I don't know. So technically, the definition could be \"unidentified.\"\n\nWe well understood exactly what that was. And when we returned, we debriefed and explained exactly what we had observed. And I felt that this had been distributed to the outside world, the outside audience, and apparently it wasn't, and so many years later, I had the time in an interview to disclose these observations, on another country's television network. And the UFO people in the United States were very very angry with me, that i had not given them the information. It was not an alien. Extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence. That's what Carl Sagan said. There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. The probability is almost CERTAIN that there is life somewhere in space. It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today. \n\nBut the distances involved in where some evidence of life may be, they may be hundreds of light years away.

Chris Hadfield has said that being an astronaut and a test/fighter pilot requires you to constantly train in every worst case scenario so that you are prepared for everything. He eloquently said \"as a pilot you are always thinking 'What's the next thing that's going to kill me?'\". This has influenced his life and his mindset in very small things on his every-day life, like traffic, preparing what to say to famous people, thinking what to do if there's a fire in the building, etc.\n\nHave you had this experience? Is there anything you learned from being an astronaut, 8 hours of EVA and a fighter pilot that you applied to your every day routine or maybe changed your perspective or attitude towards life?",

To appropriately respond to an emergency requires a very clear mind, to cooly analyze what the observations are and how to fix it. Fear and worry are emotions that cloud the mind from being able to think clearly, to remember what the procedures are to deal with that emergency. Dwelling on an engine failure for a pilot as he rolls down the runway is NOT what he should be thinking about - it's obtaining a smooth liftoff! But in the back of his mind, he knows *exactly* what to do (or pretty much) and in many cases, if he's alone in the fighter aircraft, he has to leave that aircraft in an ejection seat in a big hurry! \n\nWhen I am getting ready to cross a street, I look both ways before crossing. My bones, my muscles, are not what they used to be, so I am careful when I go up and down stairs, because I've heard stories of older people falling and having very disabling injuries. I have enough things that begin to go a little bit wrong as I get a little bit older. I'd just as soon not have major catastrophes to have to deal with. So I very carefully move around, avoiding dangerous situations. ",

On their way back to the Lunar Module Scott spied an impressive basalt sample (it was large and can only be formed from Magma cooling at or near the surface of a planet or moon), he stopped the Rover and to account for the stop said he was experiencing a seat belt malfunction.\n\nIrwin played along and distracted Mission Control by describing the craters. Scott got out of the rover grabbed the rock and then they hauled ass back to the Lunar Module.\n\nMission Control didn't know about this sample until after they had returned to Earth.\n\nIf you want to check out the transcripts they're [all here](http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/apollo15.htm).\n\nIf you like this kinda story, you should check out Mary Roach's book [Packing For Mars](http://www.amazon.com/Packing-Mars-Curious-Science-Life/dp/B00AR2BCLW).

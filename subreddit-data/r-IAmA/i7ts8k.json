I portrayed the tenth Doctor on BBC\u2019s Doctor Who and I am here today to talk to you about the second season of my podcast [\u201cDavid Tennant Does a Podcast With\u2026\u201d](https://apple.co/davidtennant).\n\nOn this season, I am sitting down (virtually) with some of the biggest names in entertainment, including Dame Judi Dench, Jim Parsons, Stacey Abrams, Elisabeth Moss and more. This is following an incredibly fun first season where I spoke with the likes of John Hamm, Whoopi Goldberg and James Corden. Each episode gives you an inside look at these stars\u2019 lives, packed with revealing conversation, surprise stories and, of course, lots of laughs! I\u2019m looking forward to sharing these with you.\n\nEpisode one is live today! Listen to it on [Apple Podcasts](https://apple.co/davidtennant).\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/u8oszwx0ztc51.jpg",

Making him essentially an unambiguous psychopath from the start really takes away a lot of the gravity of the reveal at the end in Moody\u2019s office. I still remember reading it for the first time, and how taken aback I was when Barty Jr slipped off his mask and showed his true devotion to the dark lord, when up to that point I\u2019d thought of him only as the poor sniveling boy crying for his mother as he\u2019s dragged away by dementors. It really drove home how difficult it would be to know who to trust, just how two-faced people can be and how scarily good they can be at it. Tenant was the *perfect* actor to portray all of that, but unfortunately he was given the most one-dimensional nothing writing of the whole series.",

Killgrave was all the best bits of the show, everything from his malicious control, to the fact hes never not been able to control people and can't know better. Davids performance turned what was quite a bad bad-guy and humanised him and made him more real. And yet how much of that was really him or just another type of control. Just such a good character and performance. \n\nIn case Mr Tennant sees this thanks for sharing your amazing talent with us, and being my favourite incarnation of The Doctor!",

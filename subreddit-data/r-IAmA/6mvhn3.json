    "postText": "TAKE ACTION HERE: https://www.aclu.org/net-neutralityAMA\n\nToday a diverse coalition of interested parties including the ACLU, Amazon, Etsy, Mozilla, Kickstarter, and many others came together to sound the alarm about the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s attack on net neutrality.\nA free and open internet is vital for our democracy and for our daily lives. But the FCC is considering a proposal that threatens net neutrality \u2014 and therefore the internet as we know it.\n\n\u201cNetwork neutrality\u201d is based on a simple premise: that the company that provides your Internet connection can't interfere with how you communicate over that connection. An Internet carrier\u2019s job is to deliver data from its origin to its destination \u2014 not to block, slow down, or de-prioritize information because they don't like its content.\n\nToday you\u2019ll chat with:\n\n - u/JayACLU - Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst with the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project\n - u/LeeRowlandACLU \u2013 Lee Rowland, senior staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project\n - u/dkg0 - Daniel Kahn Gillmor, senior staff technologist for ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project\n - u/rln2 \u2013 Ronald Newman, director of strategic initiatives for the ACLU\u2019s National Political Advocacy Department\n\nProof:\n - [ACLU] (https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/884804249632337923)\n -[Ronald Newman] (https://twitter.com/ronaldlnewman/status/884795953487765505)\n  - [Jay Stanley]( https://twitter.com/JayCStanley/status/884797237058052097)\n-[Lee Rowland and Daniel Kahn Gillmor]\n(https://twitter.com/berkitron/status/884805008813953024)\n\n7/13/17: Thanks for all your great questions! Make sure to submit your comments to the FCC at https://www.aclu.org/net-neutralityAMA\n\n",

Individual advocates and outrage have changed the public conversation-  it's now no longer acceptable for companies to admit publicly they want to act as gatekeepers to online content - they all now swear they won't; they just don't want the government telling them not to do (the thing they claim they never would). Even Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T feel compelled to take a pro-NN public stance. We MUST remain vigilant, because we know what the ISP world looks like when it's self-policing (spoiler alert: censorship), but changing the acceptable public conversation is a solid foundation for all future advocacy, and it shows what consumers can do when we band together.\n",

By the time I'm 70 years old, the type of emerging technology that we've seen over the last decade will be pervasive and part of everyday life without question. The public won't even consider net neutrality to be an issue, it will just be expected. For anyone to claim that the internet shouldn't be free from censorship and data type bias is asinine, and as the aging generations die off (as sad as that is to say) and the younger generations age, that mentality will continue to expand.",

I feel breaking it down to things less tech-savvy individuals can understand is extremely helpful. \n\nYou order 2 packages the same day, with the same shipping time. One ships FedEx, one ships USPS (which is a gov service) ... The gov blocks a road, only allowing USPS through so their package arrives on time, and FedEx's is delayed. \n\nYou go to the grocery store and are allowed access to the fruit, vegetable, and milk sections. If you'd like to purchase snacks it requires an additional membership, wine and beer are a membership, ready made foods are a membership, etc. \n\nOr even your basic utilities. Water for drinking costs X, for showering cost Y, for cooking cost Z.\n\nNow excuse me while I go get sick ... Just thinking of this as a reality is sickening.  \n",

Obviously this can't exist, because without regulations you have companies polluting the shit out of everything and using virtual slave labor with nearly non-existent wages to minimize costs and therefore prices, which maximizes profits at the expense of the environment and workers. Naturally, the government needs to step in at this point. \n\nAnother issue is that markets naturally tend toward monopolies, which stifles competition. As previously mentioned, free markets depend on consumer choice to guide business practices. However, when a single corporation owns the entire market there exists no choices for the consumer, so the corporations have no incentive to provide better service. This was the case a century ago, when the \"captains of industry\" controlled everything and jacked up prices so hard the government intervened. This is the case with ISPs today - most areas have very limited options, and this is by design. Consequently, when a new business like Google Fiber comes along, ISPs lobby *hard* to bury it, because in a perfect free market, the better service of Fiber should win. But of course, it doesn't, because perfect free markets don't exist. ",

It's easy for politicians to please powerful companies in the shadows when nobody is watching, but when they start to feel that voters are watching and care, that doesn't always guarantee victory but at least it guarantees a fight. We saw this recently when Congress voted to overturn the FCC's broadband privacy protections (which are sort of the other side of the coin of the Net Neutrality protections). Voters were MAD, and a lot in Congress are running scared over that vote now. \n\nSo stand up, make some noise, file comments with the FCC, and let your representatives know what you think!",

Without any hard contractual obligations signed in black and white, that arrangement was doomed to fail. I have no doubt that it was designed specifically to do so. It opened the gate for a lot of money to change hands, and for this idea in the public mindset that the ISP's are the ones that own the infrastructure.\n\nI find it inexcusable that there are countries, way more under developed, with internet speeds that make ours in most of the U.S. look like a joke.

The owner of the road charges you based on the weight of your car, and how many miles you're on the toll road. That makes sense to you as the amount of wear and tear you put on the road is directly related to this. You pay this fee willingly.\n\nNow one day, you're asked where you're headed after you get off the toll road. You're not being asked which exit on the toll road you're getting off at so they can calculate your mileage on the toll road, they already know that and charge you accordingly for that. You're being asked \"After you leave this toll road, which business are you headed to? If you're going to Applebee's it's no extra charge, if you're going to some independent restaurant, it'll be extra.\"\n\nYou're putting the exact same wear and tear on their road regardless of where you're going. Charging you extra for destination A vs destination B after you've already left their toll road is double dipping and should be illegal.\n\nYou might make the argument that sometimes you haul back a ton of stuff from your destination. Maybe your toll road owner says that Home Depot is just causing too much traffic and weight on their road, so Home Depot or you need to pay more if you want to go to Home Depot. It doesn't matter, because each individual that's driving stuff back from Home Depot has paid their fair share for their portion of traffic and weight on the road. If 1,000 pounds two times a day is too much for what they're charging a driver, then it's too much no matter where it's coming from and they should simply charge the driver the amount that it costs.",

And Cuboid10824, below, really nails a very powerful but simple analogy: we would NEVER accept it if our other telecommunications providers picked and chose who we communicate with based on our identity or views. Imagine if USPS only delivered mail sent by Democrats, or the phone companies only connected your line if you were calling a known conservative. And this isn't theoretical hysteria. Without NN protections in place, ISPs have already engaged in exactly this kind of ideological discrimination. The right to speak out and listen to others is absolutely fundamental to our democracy, and we cannot accept a communications network in which ISPs act as gatekeepers and only transmit the speech they approve of (or that involves their own business partners). \n",

Those revenues will be used to fund lobbyists and lawyers who will ensure that the rules are kept in place.\n",

Here's my comment:\n\n&gt; As an American citizen who utilizes the internet for education and business purposes, I strongly oppose Chairman Pai's proposal to reverse net neutrality protections. A free, open, and unfettered internet is vital for our democracy, for our businesses, and for our daily lives, both personal and professional.\n\n&gt; Net neutrality is a vitally important principle in a democratic society, not to mention in our economy: Those who stand to be most negatively-affected under Chairman Pai's proposal are independent news outlets, small businesses, start-up blogs, grassroots activist groups...and everyone who uses the internet for trade, education, communication, business, etc. (i.e. everyone). We won't stay quiet while corporations gain control over the information we consume every day.\n\n&gt; Chairman Pai's internet model would give giant internet companies the power to prioritize what we read, watch, and explore online. I won't stand for it. This is a matter of freedom, and I want to let you know that I won't sit idly by while people in power with conflicts of interest whittle away our freedom. I submit my public comment in opposition to Chairman Pai's proposal that would reverse net neutrality protections.",

First\nand foremost, you should be clear to your elected representatives and\nto the FCC (handy link: https://www.aclu.org/net-neutralityAMA) that\nyou think this is a bad idea.  Even if they take bad steps, we need to\nkeep the pressure up to try to get them to reverse them.\n\nSecondly, you can make decisions about your ISP on the basis of what\ntheir policies are about your data and about how they throttle or\nabuse their customers' traffic.  If you think you don't have any ISP\nchoices that give you good options, make a stink about it (here on\nReddit, even!).  We should be rewarding those ISPs that have good network\npractices instead of incentivizing a race to the bottom.\n\nAdditionally, you can make use of network anonymizing services like\n[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) or a VPN provider that offers\nencrypted internet access, so that specific indicators on the traffic\naren't visible to be used for throttling.  This might not be effective\nagainst \"allowlist\" style throttling (e.g. where the ISP throttles all\ntraffic that isn't coming from their preferred service), but it can at\nleast defeat \"blocklist\" style throttling (e.g. where an ISP\nidentifies a specific competitor and holds their content in the \"slow\nlane\" -- imagine Time Warner deciding that Netflix data should be\ndelayed or even blocked outright).",

But, in your hypothetical, the fight would only be just beginning.  There is potential action that could be taken by Congress.  There is potential action that could be taken at the state and local level.  For instance, when Congress rolled back protections against ISPs selling our private information earlier this year, many states opened discussion on how to legislate them back in at the state level.  There may also be forms of economic pressure that we could collectively place on the bad actor ISPs.  We\u2019ve only begun to fight.\n",

                    "comment": "There is a comment on one of the net neutrality threads on r/blog which lists many examples. Copied from there: \n\n\n    MADISON RIVER: In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.\n\n    COMCAST: In 2005, the nation\u2019s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.\n\n    TELUS: In 2005, Canada\u2019s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.\n\n    AT&amp;T: From 2007\u20132009, AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such \u201cover-the-top\u201d voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&amp;T when it came on the scene in 2009.\n\n    WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream\u2019s own search portal and results.\n\n    MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon\u2019s court challenge against the FCC\u2019s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency\u2019s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.\n\n    PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person\u2019s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service\u2019s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites.\n\n    AT&amp;T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011\u20132013, AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.\n\n    EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace.\n\n    VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon\u2019s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.\n\n    AT&amp;T: In 2012, AT&amp;T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers\u2019 iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&amp;T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&amp;T\u2019s own products.\n\n    VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency\u2019s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: \u201cI\u2019m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.\u201d Walker\u2019s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.\n",

FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency\u2019s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: \u201cI\u2019m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.\u201d Walker\u2019s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.",

That pressure had, without question, a chilling effect on more egregious actions.\n\nThink what additional actions would have occurred if no pressure from the government existed, where blocking competing VoIP services or P2P technology was perfectly fine.  What other services would have been blocked or hamstrung to favor the ISP's own services?

Everyone else gets subsidized (and fully-surveilled) \"Internet Basics\".  This would make privacy a luxury good, significantly worse than the current digital divide.\n\nRegion/location is a concern because of the limited choices that people have when in using market power to choose an ISP.  Once you're on the full Internet, you can go anywhere.  But to connect to the Internet, you might only have a few specific choices of ISP, and if none of those ISPs give you a full connection, you might be out of options.  Net neutrality is needed to push back against the sort of natural monopoly that carriers in underserved regions end up with.\n\nI've called out privacy concerns in the text above because net\nneutrality often ends up being the \"camel's nose in the tent\" for\nmassive surveillance.  Using Facebook as an example here: If you get\nmost of your news and info through Facebook, then Facebook already\nknows a lot about you and what you think.  But if you actually have to\npay significantly more money to access any non-Facebook information at\nall, or non-Facebook data is throttled, then you have a strong\nincentive to route all your traffic through the few privileged\nvendors.  If you think Facebook is fine, but you don't like Google or\nWeibo or Twitter, feel free to substitute any of them for Facebook in\nthis comment and imagine that your only available ISP had a deal\nprioritizing traffic with them :)\n",

They can ban whomever they want, whenever they want.\" However, that argument inherently stipulates that Comcast/Charter/TWC should have 100% control over who it lets on/off its network and had zero responsibility to transport content/data/information that it does not want (obviously 1A supersedes both the FCC and Title II classification). \n\nDoesn't this make Net Neutrality 'digital speech in motion' and 'digital 1A/protected speech on social media' is digital speech at rest?   Put slightly differently, if you truly believe that Twitter (or reddit or facebook or any other internet/social media company) has 100% control and 100% discretion over whose speech it lets on/off its servers and had zero responsibility to host content/tweets/people that it does not want, isn't that also arguing the Net Neutrality is unconstitutional?\n\nSCOTUS massively punted on this issue in the ~~ATT~~ Verizon case when ISPs raised it, but how do you think they 'split the baby' or *can* they split the baby?\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: my question clearly needs a plain english version.  The main issue is that most of our 'public spaces' are now on the servers of private companies and the sidewalks to get there are owned by *different* private companies.  How do we treat those digital public spaces?  And if we fully protect the sidewalks leading to those public spaces (by rejecting the ISP's argument that NN is forced speech), then don't we have to extend the same protection to those digital public spaces?  If yes, what does that mean for social media participants and companies? Can you ban Richard Spencer anymore?",

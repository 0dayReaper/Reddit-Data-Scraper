    "postText": "PROOF: https://i.redd.it/9oybmy7d9sva1.jpg\n\nI\u2019m an investigative reporter at Bloomberg News, and I extensively examined how TikTok can serve up a stream of anxiety and despair to teens. \u201cDeath is a gift.\u201d \u201cThe perfect ending.\u201d \u201cI wanna die.\u201d I spent hours watching videos like this on the TikTok account of a New York teenager who killed himself last year. The superpopular app says it\u2019s making improvements \u2014 but it now faces a flood of lawsuits after multiple deaths.\n\nWhile practically all tech companies are secretive about their data, insiders who also had experience working for Google, Meta and Twitter cast TikTok as Fort Knox by comparison. You can read my story [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-04-20/tiktok-effects-on-mental-health-in-focus-after-teen-suicide) and listen to me talk about it on The Big Take podcast [here](https://omny.fm/shows/the-big-take/the-dark-side-of-tiktok-s-algorithm). You can read my other investigations into [TikTok](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-30/is-tiktok-responsible-if-kids-die-doing-dangerous-viral-challenges) and [others here](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ATsVbi0Cia0/olivia-carville).\n\nEDIT: Thanks for joining me today. Social media has become ubiquitous in our lives, yet we do not know what the long-term impact is going to be on kids. These are important conversations to have and we should all be thinking about how to better protect children in our new digital world. I will continue to report on this topic -- and feel free to send me thoughts or tips to: ocarville1@bloomberg.net",

These companies have strict guidelines around issues like suicide or eating disorders, and strive to take down content that promotes or glorifies these topics. But, they don't want to over-censor -- or take down posts that may raise awareness of these issues or help those who are struggling. But distinguishing between content that \"promotes or glorifies\" a topic like suicide and content that \"raises awareness\" of the issue is a subjective thing. These companies are constantly reworking their policies about these issues, based on advice from experts, to try and find the balance.\n\nAs I watched some of the posts coming through to Chase Nasca's feed I became aware of how tough this is. Some of the videos said vague things like \"I don't want to be here tomorrow\" -- should that be censored? One could argue that a caption like this promotes suicide, but what if the user posted it as a joke? Or what if they were referring to school, rather than life itself? Human moderators have only a few seconds to watch a video and decide whether to take it down. That's why the policies around what should stay up and what should come down are so important.",

The entire core business model of TikTok is that it's by far the best at bringing you more of what interests you. Changing that to a bring you what is best for you, but only if you're a specific type of person in a specific age range with a specific mental health problem, is a HUGE engineering challenge that will most likely end up with those kids losing interest in your app anyway since they're not engaging with happy cheery content in the first place.  \n\nIt's sort of like asking why a team doesn't just tweak their Formula 1 car to pull a trailer so they can save on logistics costs.",

It's so hard to clearly identify the influence of social media when it's prevalence is steadily increasing alongside the world going to absolute shit. I am certain social media plays a role, but I also know that as a suicidal child and teen, peer influences and the internet were constantly being blamed for my mental health issues by my parents, teachers, and therapists. I was suicidal because even at ten years old I could see how little humans care for one another. The constant cutting me off from \"bad influences\" [read: other kids who were depressed, the writings of Sylvia Plath and other dark reading material, censoring the media I consumed] did nothing to help me because it *didn't address the root issue.* I don't doubt social media has a negative influence. But I think we could get rid of it tomorrow and the suicide rate would still be at least double what it was when I was in high school (it's presently more than triple.) Kids aren't stupid. They are influenced by social media but they also *see the world for what it is* and we need to address the exact issues you listed to make that a less desperate picture. Perhaps social media might be less dark if everyone making content wasn't living in the darkest timeline. Maybe there would be less content about how suicide is the answer *if we were providing any other answers.* The future right now is bleak and we owe our children more.",

Who only realize it through past experience and abort the cycle.\nAs we know, screens have a generally bad effect on mental health. The way out of depression most often contains a large dose of get off your ass, get out and do something. (I've been there plenty of times myself).\n\nThis message is VERY bad for the algorithm. They want you to keep watching. Meaning that complaining will always attract more complaints, as any constructive tips will end with the user going away from the platform.\n\nAdults can more easily understand the need for balance, for self-restriction and restraint. Children and teenagers can't do that easily. \nThey are a lot more prone to get stuck in the dopamine loop of having ones view confirmed and validated.\n\nCertainly it would be easier to get them out there if the world was a better place. The first step for that, is the adults getting off our own screens and getting out there and making the world better!\nBut then again, good news spreads worse than bad news.

Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, 4chan, TikTok (unless it's regulated into oblivion) - these platforms will exist for years to come. Obviously, teenagers don't have **much** interest in the opinions of adults around them, but I think that ignoring these platforms has a lot to do with the spirals that kids fall into over time.\n\nI think about Television - how hated it was by many people, how it was despised for being a soul-sucking platform that kids were addicted to. Yet there were programs like Mister Roger's Neighborhood, and many of the cartoons of the 90s and 00s that shared messages of connection and hope with kids and teens. I think there's power in that - to change the world for the better. It just takes an active participation in creating the future we want to see.",

I also agree with the points below about the world teens live in, I was bullied with scoliosis as a child and excluded, and was then permanently disabled as a teen by medical negligence during an operation for it.

The rest comes from private donation.\n\nI trust them because they don't pull punches no matter who they speak to or whose actions they cover. Whenever a story involves a company that financially supports NPR (which range from Apple and Meta to trade unions and opera houses) they disclose the connection at the beginning of the story.\n\nSomething I have realized in my news consumption (which includes input from NYT, Forbes, The Guardian, Washington Post, BBC, CNN, NPR, and even once or twice a year Fox News, as well as Stephen Colbert and John Oliver) is that every outlet has a ratio of \"what happened\" to \"what you should think about that\" in their reporting. You wouldn't want a cold reading of facts with no human filter at all, but you can't have the other extreme either. Fox News, and Tucker Carlson in particular, is a good example of a very low fact/opinion ratio. He takes a small amount of information and speculates on various nightmarish scenarios that might arise. I would say maybe 15/85. CNN I would say is about 65/35. Washington Post somewhere around 75/25, similar for NYT, WSJ, Guardian. NPR I would say 80/20.\n\nIDK, you have to eventually trust someone to be telling the truth, and I'll take these guys over nutcases like Alex Jones and Joe Rogan.",

A fair chunk of people that downvoted you probably missed it too. \n\nThe whole point is the chemistry definition (think the trans in \"trans fats\") applied to something a few times removed from that field.\n\nIt wasn't about whether someone had what combo of X or Y chromosomes. They were using the chemistry term for what a trans compound is and claiming it's what people thought made someone trans. Like one of your chromosomes was a trans isomer (some of the atoms were attached on the alternate side of a bond).\n\nBeing generous it might be because that's the only definition of trans they'd come across before hearing \"transgender\". It's more of a \"totally misunderstood your homework\" kind of wrong rather than being a bit off with your logic.",

The FDA also does due diligence on new medicines and alerts the public to safety issues when they arise.\n\nWhen this happens, in a meaningful way, it causes the FDA to raise the bar on safety studies that the FDA requests to approve a new drug. It's an imperfect process and there are plenty of areas in which process and regulation fails, but I do feel like it raises the bar, in part because companies are concerned about liability should they fail to properly evaluate new medicines. There have been billion dollar settlements associated with drug safety issues and as a result, resource-rich companies routinely profile medicines with relatively inexpensive tests to de-risk them against known liabilities.  It takes a lot of work to develop those tests, but they've been immensely powerful in filtering out potentially risky drugs before we're testing them on people.\n\nI would love to see a regulatory environment that encourages the same behavior on algorithms.  What's interesting about drugs is that we don't always fully understand the mechanisms underpinning why a drug causes harm, in much the same way that we don't understand why an algorithm does -- but in the same way that we can measure that a drug alters heart rhythms in a negative way (not necessarily understanding why), we could certainly measure the extent to which an algorithm recommends self-harm or racist content. We just need to decide as a society that this is a thing we want new algorithms to not do, and require that of them. Those that fail to do due diligence would be open to liability in the same way that a pharmaceutical company would be.",

Tech companies have admitted to rigging the game, take for example Facebook. Anytime someone reacts to a post that adds points to the posts ranking. So negative and divisive posts ranked higher, because that's a reflection of the biases built into the human psyche right? Well behind the scenes the angry emoji was boosting visibility by 5x as much as any other reaction. \n\nChina's version of TikTok called Doujin, which runs on the same platform as TikTok, has their algorithm engineered in a different direction. Science, education, history, social cohesion over division, patriotism (patriotism isn't quite the right word for it since it's loyalty to the one party state). The specificity and tone of their content promotion shows that they are highly adept at rigging the algorithm on a  topic by topic basis towards their communist party ends. \n\nSo a Chinese Communist Party owned company has the means to promote social pathology in enemy states, why wouldn't they? They're already as by-the-book dystopian as they can manage and then some. They have over half a billion surveillance cameras that track and identify citizens by the way they walk, increasingly jail human rights lawyers, and enslave and genocide an ethnic minority. Why wouldn't they just do what they have the power to do when its to their own benefit?",

This issue highlights the need to resist unwarranted government intrusion in our lives.\n\nAdditionally, it is essential to recognize that major social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google can be just as guilty of privacy breaches and invasive practices as apps like TikTok, which is currently being targeted. This is exemplified by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which exposed Facebook's involvement in the misuse of user data for political purposes. Such situations can be seen as virtue signaling, with selective focus on particular platforms while ignoring similar issues with others.\n\nDrawing parallels between these companies emphasizes the importance of vigilance in protecting our data and privacy rights, regardless of the platform or service provider.\n\nUltimately, sacrificing privacy for security could lead to the loss of both, making it crucial for individuals to stand up against overreaching policies and practices.",

All I'm saying is that it's not a partisan issue to criticize a tech company, and I find it strange that people jump the defense of one platform with whataboutisms. \n\nIt shouldn't be a \"but,\" it should be a \"yes and\" - not with regard to the specific proposed legislation of the Restrict Act, but when criticism is levied toward an objectively destructive force.\n\nI guess I'm just a bit miffed that most anything these days needs to be met with an argument or a contrarian stance. That's not to say everyone needs to agree on everything, but people dismiss, reject, or form allegiance in opposition to the *entire* notion of things, rather than their details, all too easily. \n\nThis isn't a jab at you, btw, just a clarification of intent in replying to the OP of this thread - who immediately equated valid criticism with political shilling because of some superficial connection, rhetoric that's regurgitated online, and an abundance of comfort in perpetuating tribal identities that sow division.",

The article describes that the opaque nature of the algorithm is part of the problem, there are teams staffed to 'Safety' that aren't given contexts they need to perform their duties effectively.\n\n\n\"Yeah, not sure why you're saying bombing Hiroshima was so bad, nuclear science is pretty complicated, wondering how you were able to get the details of the Manhattan Project??\"",

It\u2019s a difficult one though because some of the specialists I work with are highly specialised and they\u2019ve told me they\u2019ve struggled with interviews. Do you think this could be because the interview questions are too broad? A specialist works within a small area within a team - so it\u2019s easy for a question about the broader functioning of the business might throw them, and make their attempt at answering seem bumbling and simplistic. \n\nSo I think the pointedness of the questions is important\u2026 in my own experience with recruiters the questions haven\u2019t been - but when they have been conducted internally by HR with a team member present then this allows for questions I can answer using my experience. \n\nDo you notice this gap in communication as a recruiter?",

Practical answer is that an ideal hiring cycle is HR/Recruiter Phone interview then Hiring Team phone interview then on site interview.

Typically for experienced roles they are looking for hard skills they don\u2019t have already, hence why it is over indexed.\n\nTheoretical answer is that if the hiring cycle is dragging on it\u2019s a bad employer. If they care so little about candidate experience, I can\u2019t imagine what it is like being an employee there. \n\nDuring agency recruiting we walked away from clients with long cycles, and to no surprise they always had turnover.",

I have had people reach out an thank me after offers have come through and express how excited/happy they are\n* Get to talk to a lot of different people and learn a lot about different industries/roles\n* Can make some decent money doing it\n* You learn SO much about the job search process from how to interview, make resumes, get jobs, negotiate, etc. which I think will be valuable for the near term\n\nCons\n\n* Always seem like the first to go during an economic slow down. When hiring stops, you have a much lighter workload.\n* Personally I am a more introverted, so if I have 7 phone interviews in a day I am pretty drained\n* You can have some bad customers or candidates who make you lose faith in humanity, but this isn't the norm\n* You are working with people on both sides of the equation, so human emotions/behavior is always driving everything and can make the day to day volatile.",

In larger organizations that head count is typically separated between recruiting groups and prioritized differently. \n\nFor early career there is more focus on academics and internships/co-ops, so your degree, school, gpa, etc. can carry more weight. Professional is looking more towards experience. The experience they are looking for will be specific to the need of the role.\n\nBoth will still look at culture fit for the hire which is more soft skills being aligned with the company culture.  When hiring, you are always making a bet on the longevity of the person in the role. In an ideal world employers want strong talent to stay forever. The stronger they align with the culture helps make the bet that they will stay, but you can never forecast that 100%.",

There are essentially three placements agencies work on and get paid for.\n\n* Direct Placement is essentially placing a candidate directly with the company from first day of employment. They usually get a % fee of the base salary from the company. Actually incentivizes the agency to get a higher offer. \n* Mark ups are for contract positions. Essentially the agency will charge a percentage increase of your hourly pay to the company. Again, this helps the agency because when your hourly rate increases they get paid more. \n* Bill rates. This is the worst incentive structure IMO. They charge the company a flat rate. This means that the lower they pay a person, the more money they make from the spread. Again this is on contract to hire or contract roles. \n\nRegarding the desire for a call, I get it. It does sound like that recruiter sucks since he wasn't willing to be flexible and hounding you. \n\nIf its agency they want to have a call for a few reasons. 1) the recruiter is probably tied to metrics based on number of calls 2) they prefer a call so they can sell you on the position since agencies are paid on placements 3) if they are a good recruiter, they would prefer just having the call to understand your motivations and interests to network with you for the long term while seeing if this role is a fit.  \n\nGiven this recruiter hounding you I would bet it is 1) or 2). Them not being willing to email anything is a red flag.",

FAANG pay really was paying top 5% of the market so their consistent layoffs are driving candidate asks down.\n\nIt will come back. Especially when hiring accelerates again.  Recruiting is so volatile that when there is an uptick people can't hire enough. In addition, many people being laid off are starting their own things and leaving the corporate rat race, so supply should be even less.",

The days of working for peanuts and over delivering or handling multiple tasks outside of what you were hired to do are over. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, the workforce, younger Gen Xers. Millennials and Gen Zers, now have seen how important work life balance is and demand it or to be properly compensated to not have it. However, it appears that the ones who make hiring decisions, or the people they report, are out of touch with this new reality and as a result they struggle to attract and retain talent, have issues with WFM, or to properly adjust salaries to market rates but are quick to use the \"no one wants to work\" excuse, instead of adapting and evolving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre you seeing a shift in this mindset/approach from hiring companies? Or is that wishful thinking?",

That lead to additional conversations blending with retention and WFM strategy. Drivers in that were compensation increases, flexibility, etc. \n\nHowever, with generational differences and the economic climate I do anticipate many of the old school mental models re-entering due to employers having leverage. However, I do see a consistent trend from the younger workforce demos being focused on pay, work life balance and not being tied to their careers. Less tolerance for arbitrary rules. I fall within those groups. They are less apt to flex, and it seems that they will risk it on their own before being overworked and underpaid.\n\nMore power to the workers and I believe they are in the right. Hiring Companies are regressing given the economy, but feel that when hiring rebounds employees will have a lot of leverage based on the younger demo sentiments.",

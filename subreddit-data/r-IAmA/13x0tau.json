    "postText": "Hi Reddit! We are Richard Hopkins and Andrea Holden, Team Principal and Team Manager of Sunswift 7 - a solar-electric car designed and built by university students here at UNSW.\n\nLast year our team took Sunswift 7 to the Australian Automotive Research Centre in Victoria to attempt to set the Guinness World Record for the Fastest EV over 1000km on a single charge.\n\nWe completed the 1000km in 11 hours and 52 minutes - and at the start of the year, the Guinness team confirmed that we got the record.\n\nThis year, we\u2019re gearing up to compete in the [Bridgestone World Solar Challenge](https://www.bridgestone.com/bwsc/) and will be starting work on the next iteration of the car, Sunswift 8.\n\nWe previously shared some [photos of Sunswift 7 to r/ pics](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/103nblq/i_led_a_team_of_students_to_build_a_solarpowered/) and loved answering your questions so we thought we\u2019d jump back on to chat about the project, solar-electric cars and all things engineering!\n\nAsk us anything!\n\n[Proof pic from the workshop!](https://imgur.com/a/jZGTIH2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlrighty - that's all we have time for today folks! Thanks for the great questions!\n\nWe'll keep an eye on the post throughout the day and jump back in where we can!\n\nIf you're keen to learn more about Sunswift Racing and what we're working on you can check our website: [https://www.sunswift.com/](https://www.sunswift.com/)\n\nCheers, Richard and Andrea.",

Our motors are 99% efficient which is significantly more than standard electric motors, the aerodynamic drag on our car is half that compared to a Tesla and the car only weights 580kg. All of these things mean that it is effectively \u201csipping\u201d energy as it drives. \n\nNot to mention the impact of solar as well, obviously being a solar car \u2013 we estimate that for the world record, the solar increased our range of approximately 30% which is a huge help. \n\nAnd to top that off, our battery is only 38kWhs. So we\u2019re able to achieve a range of double a Tesla with close to half the battery size which we\u2019re pretty proud of. A Tesla model S has an energy consumption of 20kWhs/100km, Sunswift 7 has is 3.8kWh/100km. \n\n-Andrea",

The chassis for example was manufactured bespoke by us with one of our partners up in Gosford, McConaghy, over a 3-month period. While we did have a few existing parts that were suitable on the shelves before we started developing Sunswift 7, a large proportion of our technology was designed and manufactured by us. \n\nIn terms of the process, we have 4 phases within our team; design, manufacture, assembly and testing. While Sunswift 7 is a \u201ccomplete\u201d car, we\u2019re constantly innovating and developing our technologies. \n\n-Andrea",

For me personally, I joined this project as a student in April of 2020 and graduated only a few weeks ago and have now been employed to help Richard run the project which is great to be a part of. \n\nAs for what\u2019s going to happen in the future, I\u2019m not 100% sure at the moment!\n\nA lot of the skills that our team learn while working on such a dynamic project like Sunswift Racing are directly transferrable to many industries for their future careers. Additionally, lots of students go on to do further work with our industry partners. We also have around 30+ alumni that have gone on to work for Tesla and SpaceX. \n\n-Andrea",

Regardless Power Optimisation, Weight, Low Rolling Resistance, and good Aerodynamics are the key pillars.

A VIP is technically a course where you get a mark and units of credit... However, the course is spread over 3 terms rather than 1 and it's at the end of your 3rd term where you receive your mark and 6 UoC.\n\nAll 3 terms have to be done consecutively. It\u2019s 150 hours but across 3 terms (30 weeks) so 5 hours per week although I don\u2019t know one student who only does 5 hours per week! The dynamics of the project and how you can learn more than you would ever imagine mean students do much more.\n\nYou can technically join as a 2nd year and stay until you graduate. Only very few only stay for one year.\n\nFeel free to email me or visit the [ChallENG website](https://www.challeng.unsw.edu.au/challeng-projects/sunswift-racing) for more info.\n\n\\-Richard",

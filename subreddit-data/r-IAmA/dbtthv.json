    "postText": "I\u2019m Neil Bedi, an investigative reporter at the Tampa Bay Times (you might remember me from this [2017 AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6vbfpe/were_reporters_who_investigated_a_power_plant/)). I spent the last several months looking [into a psychiatric hospital that forcibly holds patients for days longer than allowed](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/) while running up their medical bills. I found that North Tampa Behavioral Health uses loopholes in Florida\u2019s mental health law to trap people at the worst moments of their lives. To piece together the methods the hospital used to hold people, I interviewed 15 patients, analyzed thousands of hospital admission records and read hundreds of police reports, state inspections, court records and financial filings. Read more about them in [the story](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/).\n\nIn recent years, the hospital has been one of the [most profitable psychiatric hospitals in Florida](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/#chartbuilder-export). It\u2019s also stood out for its shaky safety record. The hospital told us it had 75 serious incidents (assaults, injuries, runaway patients) in the 70 months it has been open. Patients have been brutally attacked or allowed to attempt suicide inside its walls. It has also been cited by the state more often than almost any other psychiatric facility. \n\nLast year, it hired its fifth CEO in five years. Bryon \u201cBJ\u201d Coleman was a quarterback on the Green Bay Packers\u2019 practice squad in 2012 and 2013, played indoor and Canadian football, was vice president of sales for a trucking company and consulted on employee benefits. He has no experience in healthcare. Now he runs the 126-bed hospital.\n\nWe also found that the hospital is part of a large chain of behavioral health facilities called Acadia Healthcare, which has had problems across the country. Our reporting on North Tampa Behavioral and Acadia is continuing. If you know anything, email me at [nbedi@tampabay.com](mailto:nbedi@tampabay.com).\n\n[Link to the story.](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/north-tampa-behavioral-health/)\n\n[Proof](https://twitter.com/_neilbedi/status/1179032032866963456)\n\nEDIT: Getting a bunch of messages about Acadia. Wanted to add that if you'd like to share information about this, but prefer not using email, there are other ways to reach us here: https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/tips/\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks so much for your questions and feedback. I have to sign off, but there's a chance I may still look at questions from my phone tonight and tomorrow. Please keep reading.",

She said, during one of the few allowed visiting hours, she met other families with almost identical experiences. I started calling around and heard the same thing again and again.\n\nIt's too soon to tell what will happen, but I'll be reporting and keeping an eye out.",

They have 3 psychiatrists and a social worker meet with you for like an hour a day to come up with potential diagnoses. I had previously been diagnosed with depression, but they diagnosed me with bipolar II, which makes an extraordinary amount of sense to me. And I was there voluntarily (they have a great ward that allows phones and stuff after a day, if they deem the patient in a state to use them. Having my Switch was a godsend). I cannot fucking imagine the scenario that you just proposed. Even being at a place voluntarily, I was panicking the next morning. It is so horrifying to realize that you literally cannot leave a place. To be forced into such a place for no reason and then told that you have a lifelong debilitating illness without so much as a questionnaire is horrifying.",

Seems like that is the root of the problem.\n\nAnd I was surprised to see Acadia Healthcare is publicly owned, so one effective way to pressure them is to encourage their large shareholders to divest.\n\n&gt; Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC) has 275 institutional investors and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These institutions hold a total of 114,093,418 shares. Largest shareholders include Price T Rowe Associates Inc /md/, Wellington Management Group LLP, Vanguard Group Inc, BlackRock Inc., Aristotle Capital Management, LLC, P2 Capital Partners, LLC, Dimensional Fund Advisors Lp, JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Elliott Management Corporation, and Ares Management Llc.\n\n**T Rowe Price** recently increased their stake to owning 14.8% of the company, and **Wellington Management Group** increased to 11.4% ownership. **Vanguard** appears to have their holdings split between entities but together own almost 15%.\n\nIf you have any relationship (retirement accounts) with those organizations, you could contact them, divest yourself and explain that you encourage them to divest themselves.",

They keep people a couple extra days. Still very bad, but much less likely to attract scrutiny or litigation.",

It sounds really similar to what you've been looking into. Often, \"consultants\" for the clinics will give false or exaggerated diagnoses and refer kids to programs they receive a kickback from. The kids are bounced around different clinics until the parents run out of money, or catch onto the scam.\n\nIt's a HUGE industry in the US, and incredibly damaging to the patients.\n\nI was stuck in the troubled teen industry as a patient for two years, and years later I still struggle with PTSD from being put in solitary, kicked, slapped, and forced to skip meals as punishment.\n\nThanks for your time and the work that you do.",

            "comment": "Hey OP, do you have any advice for me? Reading your story was shocking, this happened to me in Texas just a year ago. It ruined my entire university graduation and destroyed my mental health. There\u2019s nothing that provoked anxiety and hopelessness more than being forced to stay in a mental facility against your will for days while you effectively fail your classes by absence. How prevalent are these places across the US, and what rights do we have? I\u2019ve been unable to pay these \u201cbills\u201d which to me seem more like ransom money, can I sue? How successful are people who challenge their experiences in court?\n\nMy story: I was beginning my final semester of senior year at Texas A&amp;M. Never once had a panic attack, was a great student in biochemistry, and I must have been pretty ignorant about mental health. I was up late several nights studying, when I went to a party in my apartment complex. Suddenly I had my first ever panic attack, and was paranoid that I got poisoned. I called the ambulance, and in my lack-of-sleep, freaked out state, told them I might have taken too many pills. At the time, I realized I was being paranoid, so I wanted them to think it was an accident. Clearly I was just not thinking straight, it was a traumatic moment in my usually boring life that took a random turn. My first panic attack, I had truly no idea what those were before.\n\nNext thing I know, I\u2019m sleepy, in the hospital, and the sherif is telling my to sign some forms. I\u2019m a student, I think it\u2019s an insurance thing. I sign. Finally they bring a car around with two police officers and take me to a psych hospital. I\u2019m told I can\u2019t leave. I\u2019m trapped in there for nearly a week. \n\nI fail my classes for that semester, and the screaming people in the building just make it worse. I\u2019m treated like a crazy person. I\u2019m in shock, crying, now I look insane. I start to think I\u2019ve gone mad. Every day I wake up, I\u2019m told I can\u2019t leave since I\u2019m a threat to myself and others. I can\u2019t use my cell phone, I cant go anywhere but my room and the cafeteria by escort. They tell me I would have to stay longer if I don\u2019t participate in \u201cgroup therapy.\u201d Everyone on staff looks at me like a nut job, and convinces me I\u2019m mad. After a week, I\u2019m let out. My family doesn\u2019t look at me the same way, and I have no classes to go back to.\n\nIt\u2019s taken over a year to recover from this. For those who don\u2019t understand why this affected me so bad, I don\u2019t blame you. I never took mental health complaints seriously before this. This can happen to anyone. And it can happen randomly. And to be treated this way, is a life-altering trauma. I still have moments where I wonder if I\u2019ve gone insane. Sparked by simple things like being tired at the end of the day, or forgetting my keys. It\u2019s worse when I think about it, worrying that if I have another moment of stress, that cops will take me away and send me to an institution. Being institutionalized against your will, losing your college graduation, having family told you\u2019re mental, and spending a week confined to a wing with actual insane men screaming at you. This can ruin years of your life.\n\nI eventually graduated a year later, did well on GREs, and put my life back on track. But what should have been a simple case of \u201cfirst panic attack\u201d turned in to a year of hopelessness and paranoia. All because there\u2019s an entire industry designed to capitalize on people\u2019s trauma, and incentivized to make it worse.\n\nEdit: **Some people are wondering if this was an acceptable misunderstanding.** So I\u2019ll go over what happened here. I had a panic attack. It was my first one. I called an ambulance, since I knew something was wrong but didn\u2019t know what. They took me to the hospital. I told them maybe it was a stroke, maybe I took vyvanse twice without realizing it, maybe my friend poisoned me, I don\u2019t  know! Help me! I never suggested I tried to kill myself.\n\nThe hospital was slow that night. When they put me in a room, there was no need to move me anywhere. They could have simply waited till morning, when I was awake, less disoriented, and could talk with them about what might have happened. Instead they make me sign a paper \u201cfor treatment\u201d and now I\u2019m being sent to an institution.\n\nWhat if I had been in a car crash and had a concussion? I\u2019d be disoriented the same way. Should they assume \u201che may have done it to commit suicide, let\u2019s make him sign this form and throw him in the crazy house to be safe.\u201d When the hospital isn\u2019t crowded, I literally just arrived, it\u2019s the middle of the night, and nobody has interviewed me to ask what happened. \n\n**Institutionalizing someone like that doesn\u2019t happen by mistake. That only happens when you deliberately take advantage of a patient** Wait six hours and ask me. Jumping the gun and marking down \u201cprobably suicide but he can\u2019t answer right now so we haven\u2019t talked to him about it\u201d isn\u2019t rational, and it doesn\u2019t happen by mistake. I can\u2019t imagine this is legal, but apparently it is, not enough people know this is going on, and it happens way too often.",

The second day, they loaded me up with 500mg of Seroquel (which I now know should only be used for patients with psychosis, which I did not have). They also stockpiled my chart with diagnoses that were later overturned, including but not limited to: Bipolar 1, Dysthymia, Obesity, Social Anxiety Disorder, and compulsive lying.\n\nOver the course of the 10 days I was there, I watched every minor in there with me be drugged to the point we were nonfunctional. They played Inside Out on a loop, refused to take us outside or even look out windows. In those 10 days I watched a girl attempt to strangle herself, another slit her wrists with a Crayola marker case, another bashed her head against a wall repeatedly, another got curb stomped, and my roommate attempted to strangle me in my sleep. \n\nWe were promised phone calls to our families every night, but if the nurse on duty didn't feel like getting the phone, no calls for us. I wasn't allowed to hug my family during visitation. We had 1 mandatory meeting where halfway theough, my in-hospital therapist asked me to leave so she could speak to my parents privately. She told my mother I attempted suicide because of her and to not say anything to me about it. I absolutely did not attemot because of her. My mother had no chance to speak to me about it, they were rushed out without saying goodbye to me. She spent the next 6 or 7 days thinking my suicide attemot was caused by her. She  asked me if it was true the day I left.\n\nOn the 9th day there, they had me sign paperwork saying I could go home the next afternoon. They asked if I would join their out-patient program and my parents and I said no. The morning after signing those papers, they pulled me aside and told me I wouldn't be going home - I was still too depressed, hadn't shown a will to get better, aggressive, and fat. My parents had to threaten legal action to get me out. They would have kept me till they felt they got enough money out of us.\n\nIt took me years to prove to psychiatrists that none of those diagnoses had any backing. There was something wrong with me, but I would never know until they ignored what my file said and stopped treating me for lies. It wasn't until I was 19 that I began treatment for Bipolar 2, GAD, and PTSD onset from what happened in that hospital. 3 of the friends I made from that horrible place killed themselves.",

I was well aware of what I could and could not say to keep my visit voluntary. I disagreed on having specific plans for suicide, just stating continuously that I was remarkably sad and didn't care about if I was still alive or not. I'd later learn that apathy is still considered \"passive suicidal behavior\" when someone wants to use it against you.  \n\nThey took me in, asked some standard questions, and sent me to bed. All I needed was just company that night. When I went to ask to be released the next day, I was denied and forcibly held against my will. \n\nTurns out, someone lied on my intake paperwork, and suddenly that person's word was enough to hold me for 72 hours and subject me to a trial where a judge had to finally grant my release.  \n\nOn intake, they asked if I owned firearms - I answered truthfully that I did. They asked if I had any plans to harm myself or anyone else with those firearms. I answered truthfully that I did not. (Too messy, no desire). \n\nDuring my captivity, I was forced by the hospital to disclose my location and situation to my parents as a condition of my release - as a 23 year old fully self sustaining adult living half a country away from them. \n\nThe hospital claimed that I was a risk to myself and others due to my firearms ownership (in Virginia, of all places) and only agreed to release me if someone were to go to my condo and remove the firearms from my locked safe. This also meant that I was required to disclose my personal security for their behalf. (Fun fact, my parents are so useless that they removed the guns from my apartment - put them in the trunk of my car, and drove my car to pick me up from the hospital and take me back to my condo.) I returned them to their locked safe and retained full control of them until I chose to move to a state that would no longer allow me to own firearms. \n\nThe best part is that I arrived to the hospital with all my regular medications, and then wasn't even given my regular panic medications during the stay - all the while they acted like my anger was inappropriate while literally holding me hostage against my will. \n\nI wish nothing but a slow, painful death to the person who lied on those forms. It ensured that I will never tell the truth or ask for help from a medical professional ever again. \n\nFuck mental health services in the United States.",

Instead they sent police to get me and put me in a crisis center for 72 hours. However, although it was unpleasant, I probably really did need to be there. It probably insured that I didn't do something very drastic. The people there were kind and once my time was up I was released. They also helped me get into some programs that could help back on the outside. So not all these stories are horror stories. If you really need help, I hope you seek it.",

Hundreds of patients were stuck waiting to see a judge, but never saw one. Meanwhile, their bills grew.\"*\n\nAs someone who works at a mental healthcare facility, I found this to be horrifying. Do you mean the patients in the 86% thought they needed to wait to see a judge when in actuality their petition had been dropped? Or just the remaining 14%?\n\nAlso, did you find that the 14% for which a petition for extension remained were being held for legitimate reasons? While the incidents you documented in your article certainly do not seem to meet criteria for extension (no threat to self or others, not incompetent, etc), there are certainly patients who do pose a major risk or are seriously ill and cannot make rational decisions - they need to stay in a facility. Was this the case for any in the 14%?",

In her physical state, those meds could easily have killed her within weeks. Luckily another family member was very on top of things and stopped the nursing home from drugging her. Spoiler alert: her mood improved considerably, she did walk again, and she's not depressed. She was just (rightfully) sad over the loss of independence.",

I couldn't handle it anymore and had a breakdown at my unit (usmc), which their response was throw me in a mental institute and wait it out. Typical right? But after about 2 days I'd already regained my composure only to realize that I was the only normal person there. I still have nightmares of my room's neighbor just standing up watching me in the night. The rooms were all open and there was no night guard so patients could roam freely for some fucking reason. And the room I happened to be next to was a 400lb bald man with a lazy eye and a child's voice that couldn't control his anger issues SEVERELY. Reason this is important below.\n\nSo let me get started.\nI spent about 3 weeks there against my will. I even made buddies in the staff telling them stories of military shit day to day and they'd give me cigarettes in return. I also got an extended stay because I LITERALLY had to fight for my life at one point due to poor supervision because I politely asked my neighboring room (bald boy) to, \"please stop pissing on the toilet seat of the shared restroom and I'm talking man to man here. Not mad or anything but I'd appreciate it.\"\n\nHe instantly went into a raging fit screaming at the top of his lungs it wasnt him and that he was going to kill me when I least expected over and over.. Hence catching him in my room at 2am standing over me. That was not a good time and after that stay I was extremely upset at how the mental health clinics do their business. \n\nPlease. never ever send someone you love to the opeluses health clinic in louisiana.  There has been some patients trapped in there hor half a year+.\nThe only reason i got out after 3 weeks of fucking pleading to my chain of command they took action trying to talk to staff. \n\nAma if you'd like ontop of this post as well. I can explain a few things further on if anyone's interested.",

            "comment": "One in Louisiana did that to me. I was a self admit and was told up front before signing anything that since I was a self admit, I could leave whenever I wanted. I was also told that I would receive one on one counseling. Both of those statements were lies. Upon being admitted Friday evening, I had to beg for food as I hadn't ate that day. They have me some food but it wasn't enough. The next morning when I woke up I was having a blood sugar crash and didn't want to move. I asked if they could bring me something to eat. A few minutes later the charge nurse came into the room yelling at me and saying, \"If you're that sick you need to go to a different kind of hospital!\" I told them I wanted my discharge papers, because it was clear I wasn't going to get help in a place that outright yells at their patients for asking for food. I admitted myself for suicidal depression by the way. They wouldn't release me when I requested saying that I would have to be released by the doctor I was assigned to. He wasn't working that weekend. I was examined by a weekend doctor but held against my will. I then ended up with the worst explosive diarrhea I have ever had in my life. I was also throwing up. Something was wrong with the food, but the nurses again ignored my complaints. This was during one of the coldest winters we've had down South in a long time. It was in the low to mid teens. I was constantly freezing even indoors. The boiler was out so we didn't have hot water to bathe with or to wash out hands with. I doubt the kitchen had hot water either. I had my girlfriend (now ex) call repeatedly to complain about the lack of hot water because they wouldn't listen to me or any of the other patients. I refused to shower in the freezing water. It wasn't until Tuesday evening that they fixed the boiler and I was able to take a hot shower. Turns out the pilot light had just gone out. Any halfwit with a match could have lit it. But they let the hospital go without hot water for days in the middle of winter out of sheer incompetence. There was no one on one counseling. They shove you in these demeaning group sessions and treat you like a child. They also treat everyone like a drug addict and don't allow patients any kind of narcotic pain med even though their doctor had prescribed those meds for a damn good reason. I was (and still am) on a dosage of Tylenol 4 three times daily for separate back and neck injuries. They stopped me cold turkey from that and put me on some basic anti inflammatory. I slept on an inch thick foam mat that wasn't dense at all. The mat was on top of a wooden box which didn't help at all. You don't get your own room. I was stuck with some guy that snored like an atomic freight train. I didn't sleep. They threatened to lock me up because I kept yelling at the guy to stop snoring. Look, I can only deal with that for so long. Last night there I was moved to another room with some guy that talked in his sleep. About killing people. Yeah that's not safe. I pretty much demanded to be allowed to sleep in the common area. I was finally released Wednesday afternoon and charged somewhere around $3.5k for a visit that only made my depression worse and certainly did nothing to help me. Not to mention making me physically ill. The mistreatment at that facility only increased my PTSD. I have trouble even watching a TV show that features scenes involving a mental institution.    \n\nHow can I find out if that hospital is a part of that same network? I think it is state run. Is it possible for a state hospital to be managed by a commercial entity? Why are mental health facilities allowed to get away with such abuse in this day and age? Are there resources to avocate for the patients while not actually being associated with the hospital so as to have some measure of independence? If not, shouldn't there be?",

The Baker Act is intended to protect people who are a threat to themselves or others due to mental illness. It allows a hospital to restrict a person's rights in these situations. But it also has strict guidelines so the patients are still protected. The article outlines how the hospital skirts or breaks those guidelines. It's also why even though some families fought hard against this, they felt like they couldn't do much.",

They do this by petitioning the judge for an extension; the judge has 5 days to respond, but 86% of the time the institution dropped the petition before the judge ruled on it. \n\nIt sounds like the perfect way to bill an extra couple of nights at $1,500 each while being within the law and not getting cited for phony diagnosis.",

            "comment": "I was Baker Acted while at a drug rehab in Florida and I had something very similar occur at Imperial Point Hospital. Florida healthcare in general is just super suspect and there is a lot of fraud going on down there. But anyways I was baker acted for saying something about killing myself at the rehab. This hospital kept me for EIGHT days (I was recommended just overnight and the max baker act stay from every one I've talked to is 3 days) and I saw a doctor twice (10 minutes each time) during this entire stay. There were other patients who seemed completely fine who had been there MONTHS in this lock down facility.\n\nFuck that place.\n\nMy question is: Are you looking into any other facilities?  While, this story is definitely pretty crazy, I think it has the potential to be much bigger because from others I've spoken to and the 2 years I spent involved in Florida health care THIS IS HAPPENING EVERYWHERE.  And no one wants to believe anything because those who go to a mental health institution are usually immediately discredited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I should include that I was only released when my parents flew down from the northeast and threatened legal action. This was on a Thursday, they agreed to let me go but apparently don't do releases on Fridays or weekends so I was released on Monday.",

            "comment": " \n\nHi  Neil.  Using a throwaway so as to not doxx myself.  There's another  facility near you that I'd really like you to check into.  Their current  name is \"The Care Center at Pinellas Park\".  They may have changed  names, not sure if they changed owners or management.\n\nAbout  10-15 years ago my grandmother was there for rehab after a stroke.  Not  only did they keep her there longer than expected, they also started  drugging her, claiming she was screaming in the middle of the night and  being very disruptive - which was not at all like our grandmother.   Fortunately my aunt and I lived nearby, and we would check on her now  and then. The pieces fell together when the facility suggested to my  aunt that my grandmother may never recover from her stroke, and oh, by  the way, they had an assisted living facility on their second floor.\n\nWe  talked to a few people, and found out that we could not remove her from  the facility without losing something - medicare, medicaid, I don't  remember - which we could not afford.  What wound up happening was that  the place screwed up in her care badly enough that they had to call an  ambulance and have her taken to the ER.\n\nOnce  at the ER my aunt told the people at the hospital what happened.  They  said they \\*\\*\\*often\\*\\*\\* heard similar reports about the same facility, and  would make sure our grandmother didn't go back to that same rehab  facility.  She recovered, was transferred to another facility, and was  successfully rehabbed. I was told my parents, aunts &amp; uncles  investigated our options but we were basically limited to filing a  complaint with the state, which my aunt did.\n\nClearly  this place preyed on the elderly, looking for people who don't have  relatives nearby or who don't care about them.  We suspect this place  realized we cared and intentionally mistreated our grandmother until she  had to go to the ER just to free up the bed and try to get someone else  in her place.  Not even considering the lack of ethics of this, we  wonder how many people they've KILLED neglecting their care to have them  sent back to the ER.\n\nIs there any chance you could check this place out?",

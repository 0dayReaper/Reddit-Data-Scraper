    "postText": "Thirty years ago, I made a game called Prince of Persia. Later, I worked with Ubisoft (as game designer) and Walt Disney Pictures (as screenwriter) to relaunch the franchise with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\u2013\u2013the game in 2003, the movie in 2010.\n\nNow we're celebrating the original game's 30th anniversary with a new illustrated and annotated hardcover book of my 1980s game-dev journals: The Making of Prince of Persia, just published by Stripe Press. Ask me anything!\n\nWell, ALMOST anything. I can\u2019t answer questions about unannounced projects, even (especially) Prince of Persia. Alas.\n\nInfo about the new Prince of Persia book at https://press.stripe.com/ and https://jordanmechner.com/journals.\n\nInfo about all my projects (PoP games, movies, graphic novels, and others) at https://jordanmechner.com.\n\nI'm also on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, usually in that order. My social media links are in the footer at jordanmechner.com.\n\nAnd for a 20-minute look behind the scenes of making Prince of Persia, check out this ArsTechnica War Stories episode: https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/war-stories-how-prince-of-persia-slew-the-apple-iis-memory-limitations/ \n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/d6urcqn11fv41.jpg\n\n***UPDATE: AMA is finished. Thanks for so many great questions and comments! I wish I'd had time to answer more of them.

It is true that the first games were home console, starting with the Odyssey, but much of the drive for sales came from arcade ports - which were designed to eat your quarters.\n\n\n\nAdd to this technical limitations, and games were mostly reflex-based.  This is the arcade and technical influences combined.  \n\n\nAdd further the fact that game fans tended to be those who thrived in this brutal atmosphere.  Due to this the momentum was in continuing to create these very tough games.\n\n\nBottom line:  This all created a culture of games being hard - a test of skill - that took many years to derail.  I think games like Myst were kinda pivotal, as well as early 3D stuff (that had to be easier to accommodate the visuals) in paving the way to more story-driven experiences.\n\n\nThat said, I miss when games were about reflexes.  Nowadays, you don't really have to develop skill to beat a game.  Nothing better than getting good enough at Contra to make it till level 5 without a death - it took weeks to get there and it was supremely satisfying because you really had to work at it.\n\n\n\nBTW, not calling you out here, just makes me think how different games used to be...",

Do you still own the license? Did Ubi buy it? The reboot games are on GoG, so presumably someone has contacts there.",

I don't have a question but wanted to say to you: Prince of Persia is a game that is quite close to my heart and had positively influenced my thinking from the time I played it. I grew up in apartheid South Africa as a person of Indian descent. Under apartheid, the government made non-white people believe that they will never be good enough for anything and should stick to their assigned roles in society. Prince of Persia destroyed that conditioning for me. The Prince was the coolest action game character I had come across and he was just like me.",

To clarify, your question is about the first story for the Sands of Time game at Ubisoft Montreal before I joined the team, right?\n\nWhen I came on board in 2002, I replaced the writer of that first draft, he moved to a different project, so we never actually got to work together on SoT. I kept a few elements I liked, but basically started over. There was no conflict, it's normal for game narratives to go through many iterations, especially at that early stage.",

It was so well-written, and weaving actual gameplay mechanics into the storytelling with the rewind feature and the \"No wait, that's not what happened...\" aspect was brilliant. I also remember staring at the screen for a good 15 seconds before realizing I was able to move the character. Graphics were amazing. \n\n\n\nI don't have a question but just wanted to be here for the AMA. It always feels a little surreal to be reminded that the game developers I grew up with and loved are still out there as actual people. Thanks for all the memories and making PoP, Jordan, and I look forward to any of your upcoming projects.",

The way that Prince of Persia revolutionized the industry was mind-blowing for me as a kid, when I began to read about games much older than me. I'm anxious waiting about the new projects mentioned.\n\nWith all being said, do you haver any personal idols (inside and outside the game industry)? How did they inspire you and how they influenced you? Have you met any of them personally?\n\nThanks for doing this AMA. I hope your book travels overseas as soon as possible to Latin America, or I'll have to import it anyways hahahahaha",

Too many to list, but here are a few:\n\nAkira Kurosawa. I read his book \"Something Like an Autobiography\" in college. His Seven Samurai was (and maybe still is) my all-time favorite film; I studied it endlessly, and Karateka was among other things a homage to how much I love his work. He was a true master and hero of mine.\n\nWalt Disney was an early role model for me as a kid. Although that hero-worship was based on an idealized image rather than a fuller understanding of who actually did what at Disney -- and my feelings now are complicated by the many dark sides of what he accomplished -- I still admire so much about his achievement.\n\nMike Nichols: filmmaker, stage director, actor, improv comic. I had the good luck to hear a lecture by him when I was at college and there are things he said that are always in my mind whenever I'm writing.\n\nBen Kingsley is one of my very favorite actors. The sheer power and warmth of his human presence, in film and in the spell he somehow casts as a public speaker, fascinates me.\n\nJohn Le Carr\u00e9 is the fiction writer for our times, the one whose next thriller I await with greatest eagerness.\n\nJeez, I could go on for hours. MANY hours.",

Your name was forever engraved in my mind because of the countless hours i spent dying to the numerous hard-but-fair traps on my way to the princess in the original Prince of Persia and to a lesser extent in Karateka too. I spent a big chunk of my childhood playing and replaying your games, and finished them numerous times. And came back to them time and again just for the pleasure of watching the incredible animations (for the time it was probably the closest to motion capture we ever got wasn't it ?) and level design.\n\nI don't really have any question for you to be fair, but I just wanted to thank you for being one of the Great Ones from the days of yore and fueling my passion to this day with fond memories (and deaths, lots of deaths). I'll be getting your book ASAP and showing it to the yung'uns.",

By the time I showed up in 1984 (as a 19-year-old college student with a floppy disk of Karateka) the company had grown a bit and moved to San Rafael, CA, down the road from George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch. It still felt like a family, but was becoming increasingly \"corporate\" -- as we programmers understood that word in the 1980s, and complained about. Little did we know.\n\nThe company continued to grow, and shifted its emphasis increasingly from games (where it started) to productivity and educational software. As a solo programmer not on salary, working basically on my own, I was already an anomaly by the time I came back to Broderbund to start making Prince of Persia in 1985. The changing atmosphere and growing pains at the company during that period from 1984-1993 are a subject I wrote about a lot in my journals at the time.",

To me, nothing says early-'80s quite like a banner printed out sideways across a couple dozen pages of fan-fold paper on a dot-matrix printer.   \n\nGranted, knowing the times, probably 90% of those copies were pirated and made $0 for Broderbund.",

I worked with them until around 1992 as a freelancer mostly working socket protocols with what they named The Sierra Network, later called The Imagination Network. \n\nAll I did from 14 on at that point was run BBSes and focus on communications protocols to deliver Usenet assets to BBS users. I met Ken Williams through a guy on FidoNet when I was building a Kermit protocol to dump queued messages to remote locations.\n\nThe Sierra I met, Ken and team, weren't like the original King's Quest team. They turned very corporate and frankly I learned a lot in that world which propelled me to 30 more years of an IT based career. I didn't get that family feel as much as I got an instant indoctrination into how we make money with assets and how we run a business. As a 17 year old it was shocking rather than feeling welcomed.\n\nI wasn't into game building, guys like you did a lot better at that, I was into making communications happen over BBS's, IP to TCP, and of course ACK efficient designs for playing games RT over our fledgling MODEM based connected world.\n\nSo while people were making the games I was only working on helping them make them playable over a modem. \n\nVery fun times back then being as young as we were. Interesting how things have turned out, so amazingly mainstream.",

Of course, we didn't use the term IP in those days. Broderbund would have preferred a Karateka sequel.\n\nIn the year (or 2 years) between Karateka and starting PoP, as my journal recently reminded me, I actually discussed with Broderbund a proposal to design and supervise a Karateka 2 in parallel with making PoP.

As the budget increases and expectations grow (like, once they decide this is going to be a $100M+ summer blockbuster), they want to be sure they're doing everything they can to maximize the chance of success. So hiring multiple writers and paying them lots of money makes the stakeholders feel confident they're getting the best version possible. Some producers do this more than others; Bruckheimer has a tendency to use many writers.\n\nIn this case, I humbly still think my version was best (I'm probably the only writer in the history of Hollywood to think that :) But if the execs gambled the entire budget on shooting a draft by a first-time screenwriter whose only previous credits were video games, and anything about it didn't work, they could be fired. By hiring five writers, with more credits, they're protected.",

            "comment": "Hi Jordan!\n\nLet me start by saying I am a game developer and a huge fan of Prince of Persia. One of my most prized possessions is a complete in box copy of it for the Super Nintendo, the first words i learned to write besides my own name were PRINCE MEGAHIT (at age 3!), and one of the things that got me into trying to get into game development were the videos of your brother jumping and running that are all around the internet. Of course you know your work has touched the life of millions, but I'm not sure you know how far away (I was born, raised and first played PoP in Catamarca, Argentina!).\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1- How did it occur to you to film actual people to make games instead of drawing like everyone else? What was the thought process behind it?\n\n2- I'm sure you've had lots of business meetings since 1985. Do you have any advise on approaching that for people who are not so experienced?\n\nAlso, a friend of mine (also a developer) hosts a business and industry related video interview show (through video call) for an important latin-american gaming and game industry news site. I'm sure you are a very busy person and i will totally understand if you can't, but if it's possible to get a half hour of your time, would you be willing to do a skype interview? It would mean so much to me if you did.\n\nThanks a lot for both doing this AMA and for your awesome work on this medium!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: First question was incomplete",

She said (I'm paraphrasing her exact words, which I wrote in my journal): \"Remember they're just guys. Pretend it's xx and xx\" (she named two people I am used to and don't feel intimidated by).\n\nBusiness people use a lot of jargon and talk like business people usually because they're insecure about their position and the value of what they contribute (which in fact, may not be much). The more you can talk straight, skip the bs and get to what is really going on and what matters, the more the people who count will appreciate it, be grateful and relieved.\n\nStraight talk, clarity and sincerity is only a problem in situations where the emperor has no clothes. And in those situations, maybe you should consider moving to a different empire, if you can.",

It paved the way for games like Another World and Flashback and I don't think I've been as impressed by a game visually as I was then.\n\nThe thing that impressed me as I discovered the background of the game was that you knew what rotoscoping was and was able to get a frame grabber/capture card for the Apple II. That wasn't impressive in the mid-90's but the late 80's it was unheard of, at least for me. How did you learn about rotoscoping and video capture?\n\nDidn't you already release your journals as a book or was that something else?",

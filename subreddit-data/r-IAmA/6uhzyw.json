    "postText": "**EDIT**\n\n**Wow!** We did NOT expect such a response. You guys are AMAZING! It's been really fun answering your questions, but we have to call it a day now. Unfortunately we won't be able to answer the +1200 comments which are posted at the time of writing this, but we will pop in over the weekend and try to answer some more.\n\n\nHere's Szurek (the Acid Wizard dog) thanking you for all the lovely questions and comments: http://imgur.com/gallery/nODIu\n\n\n**Another edit!**\n\nSince many of you had questions about art-related stuff, you might be interested in taking part in the fan art contest: http://www.acidwizardstudio.com/?p=726\n\n\n**---**\n\nWe're Acid Wizard Studio, three college buddies (and a dog) from Poland who teamed up and decided to make a game. After more than 4 years of development, we have finished work on Darkwood, a unique top-down survival horror that does not rely on jump scares.\n\nBefore Darkwood, some of us literally could not sit through some of the classics of the genre. While developing the game, we managed to slowly overcome our fear of playing horror games or even watching scary movies. We can now finally play Amnesia: The Dark Descent (at least in broad daylight ;))\n\nWe knew next to nothing about game development before starting work on Darkwood. We all had a background in animation / graphic design, but we had little idea about programming, game design or production. At one point, we sat down and declared we hate our current jobs, and instead of talking all the time about making the game of our dreams, we have to just go and make one.\n\nAfter a lot of sleepless nights, we had a vertical slice (kind of) of the game in 2013. We made a gameplay trailer using it, and the reactions to it blew away all of our expectations. We thought that we could actually make a living out of making video games, and started a Indiegogo campaign later that year to help us fund completing Darkwood. The campaign was not going well, but a second gameplay trailer wich launched during its last week gave us a big boost, and the campaign was a success. We set a deadline to complete the game by 2014.\n\nUnfortunately, our inexperience in game development led to heavily overshooting that date. We expanded the scope of the game, and made some major changes to the core design of the game late in development, which ate up a lot of time. We were forced to launch in Steam Early Access in 2014. The game was received very well by the players, and sold much more than we expected! Encouraged by this... We decided to expand the scope of the game even more!\n\nAfter that, even though we committed our lives to finishing the game as soon as possible, we continued to miss every deadline we set for ourselves. Negative reviews started popping up from players discouraged by the slow development or thinking we have abandoned the game. Development was very slow and frustrating. We bit off way more than we could chew, but we knew we had something special in our hands, and we had to complete it in the way we envisioned it. After 3 years of hard, hard work, the game is finished, and we're pretty proud of it.\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/TheAcidWizard/status/894943579851943936\n\n\n**EDIT:** By popular demand, here is our dog, Szurek (pronounced Shooreck) playing Darkwood: http://imgur.com/gallery/2V4Pl\n\n\nAnswering your questions will be:\n\nGustaw - programming, marketing, PR\n\nArtur - art, sound design, music, story\n\nKuba - animation\n\n\nTo get a glimpse of what Darkwood is about, check out this trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S3tmWfFACQ\n\nFind out more about Darkwood here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/274520/Darkwood/\n\n\n\n",

Of course by going this road, we had to accept that we will have to do things that are out (sometimes a lot) of our competences. My specialization is art, but as I was the only person in the team that had any idea about making sound (although still verry vague), sound design and music fell on my shoulders. Making Darkwood's OST was a never ending improvisation. I was playing with a medium that I did not fully understand. Maybe thanks to that we were able to create something unique and hard to define, something that breaks the common principles (which I did not know about during production). As for the story, it's like when you have a band, but there's no vocalist. There's a guitarist, drummer, someone has a bass guitar, but no one knows how to sing... so the guy that is least scared of making a idiot out of himself grabs the mic... and that was me ;)\n\nGustaw - I'd like to add that the sound design and music is probably my favorite thing about Darkwood, and Artur is the most talented person I know! :D",

Because of this, I could move through the city like a rabbit in a bramble. I was quick and cunning an clever.  \nDenna, on the other hand, had never been trained. She knew nothing of shortcuts. You\u2019d think she\u2019d be forced to wander the city, lost and helpless, trapped in a twisting maze of mortared stone. But instead, she simply walked through the walls. She didn\u2019t know any better. Nobody had ever told her she couldn\u2019t. Because of this, she moved through the city like some faerie creature. She walked roads no one else could see, and it made her music wild and strange and free.\u201d\u00a0\n\n",

Everything breathes and feels very real. The pause menu music (which I got to hear looped for hours because for the first 30 hours of playtime I was too scared to actually play longer than 3 seconds at a time during night), is dark, brooding, catchy and sounds like it was done by a producer with years of experience. If this is really something you picked up and experimented with over these last 3 - 4 years, you certainly fooled me!\n\nTo you all, I am seriously a huge fan of your work and I can't wait to finish this game in the coming weeks. Congrats on the release, and I'll be supporting your next project. Cheers! :)",

The honesty from your entire dev team is refreshing and is one of the things making me want to try this game out.

I have the fortune of having started a very modestly successful business, so I would have some income from that to keep me going during my learning period. My family is supportive of my goals.\n\nMy question(s)...  what has been the good and bad about changing careers at this point in life? While you were still figuring out game development, how much did you regret leaving your former jobs? What would you have done differently in the beginning to better prepare yourself for today?",

The industry is not what it was a few years back, and marking a indie game nowadays requires a lot of luck to be successful, so it's a great risk. I know many people who made games in which they invested a lot of time and money, and they flopped. In short - it can be a wonderful journey, but it's also a very risky one in the current state of the gaming industry.",

Sequel with some of the side characters?\nYou may have known the Darkwood world for five+ years in development. Tired of it. Saturated in it. Wanting to move on. Working on it /every day./ But for us fans, maybe we've only known hours of it, and would happily pay for more exposure in this world if the DLC was done right. \n\nThank you Acid Wizards, best of luck to you in the future!",

Where these are will be randomized at the beginning of your save, but biomes don't bleed into each other, like Sunless. And honestly a lot of the dialog, characters, and overall hazy, dreamlike, ethereal feel of things is more similar to Sunless than to, say, Dark Souls.\n\nYou know how in Sunless you can wander a direction through the wilderness/fog and then stumble upon something cool or profound to the story, and it adds itself to your map? Same idea here, even the same camera perspective. BTW this is in no way a bad thing. I love both games.\n\nEdit: Darkwood is more difficult and has a more taxing combat system than Sunless Sea, and while night times are terrifying even at late game, you don't have much to do during them than be afraid and hide in a corner with a light source. There's no building, heavy furniture crafting, base customization, etc. It's linear and just wants you to experience what it wants you to.",

After some time things become more and more complicated. The deeper into the forest, the more trees...\n\nGustaw - I agree with Kuba. Making the Indiegogo video was extremely fun, as with most of the things that happened during that time (although the campaign was stressful). The continued delays weighed very heavily on me, I hope we will do a reset now and continue our next endeavors in a more relaxed way :)",

Is there a stereo function based on the character, do songs get louder due to proximity of that character?\n\nWill there be different bulbs for the light, which \"filter\" the reality in a different way, similar to the flashlight? Other dimensions perhaps?\n\nI like how the top down view shifts for more viewing distance in the direction of travel.  To optimize on this, will players be able to rotate the map?\n\nI back another game in dev, and they have budgeted  over 100 million.  Their budget cannot save them from the unexpected, gripes and growls from the fans.  As a player, I'd rather wait on the polished final release than get it now.  Many \"kickstarter beta game testers\" are thin skinned, and upset it's a broken game, forgetting they're there to test in the first place.  Keep it up, this looks like a good game that harkens back to a golden age of top downs.  Shadowgate Diablo mashup?  I like it.\n\nI'm assuming this is on Steam?  How much, can we buy now?

First concepts of darkwood started when Gustaw was making his firts steps in programming, we wanted to make our first quick game. It was somehing like tower defense/Home alone kind of thing. We were trying to do it in week or something like that... that thing evolved into DARKWOOD :smile: ",

Maybe a DLC, Darkwood 2, or something else entirely? Who knows. We will definitely try porting Darkwood to consoles though!",

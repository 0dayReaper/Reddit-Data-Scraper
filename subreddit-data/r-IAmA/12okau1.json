            "comment": "Hi Kevin, thanks for sharing with us! I am also a podcaster, our show is a sort of love letter to \"bugs\", I'm an ecologist/entomologist and my cohost is an artist. Our shows are pretty structured because I am discussing sometihng very specific. How difficult is it for you to do an off the cuff interview with strangers and their stories? How do you prepare for a podcast that is more story focused? For exanple, I have to do a lot of research on my end. Do you read about that person ahead of time? Do you know all the specifics of the story or are you hearing it in its entirety for the first time when recording?",

So after getting the pre-interview back, I get the flow of the interview ready by dividing main points and then expanding those points during the interview. \r  \n\r  \nI do a lot of research beforehand and even too much sometimes which makes me think about questions too much during the episode and that doesn\u2019t appeal to my guests since I'm not listening as I should.\r  \n\r  \nAn example of my complete process is : After I get confirmation of my guest I send out a pre-interview, around 10 questions. When I get it back I focus my research on their passions. If you like surfing I\u2019m going to get the jist of a surfers world and questions one would ask a surfer. \r  \n\n\nedit: a few words",

Have you tried that format before, or do you prefer to host in a more private setting? \n\nWhen you're selecting guests, how do you make sure they won't bring up wildly inappropriate topics? Lots of people nowadays will take any chance to push their own  views on others. Do you set up a guideline beforehand for them or discuss what stories they'll share?",

Also it is not live so cutting sections that go too far is a peace of cake.",

While I am not a medical expert, I can share some potential risks and factors associated with this form of wrestling.\r  \n\r  \nMental health issues: The repeated exposure to violent situations and the stress of participating in extreme wrestling matches may lead to mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, or PTSD. The wrestling environment might also normalize violence, which could affect a wrestler's personal life and relationships.\r  \n\r  \nLong-term health problems: Besides the obvious scarring and risk of injury during matches, wrestlers may experience long-term health issues due to the physically demanding nature of their sport. Chronic pain, joint problems, and neurological issues are possible consequences of a prolonged wrestling career. Additionally, the use of weapons like light tubes, knives, and razor blades can lead to infections or other complications if not managed properly.\r  \n\r  \nAs for why this type of wrestling is considered \"okay\" by some, it is often seen as a form of entertainment that caters to a specific audience that enjoys the extreme and violent aspects of the sport. Some wrestlers may be drawn to the adrenaline rush, the challenge, or the notoriety that comes with participating in deathmatch wrestling.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, whether or not one feels comfortable participating in such events is a personal choice. Some wrestlers might be more willing to take on extreme risks for the sake of their career or for the entertainment of their fans. However, it is important for wrestlers and promoters to prioritize safety and consider the potential long-term consequences of participating in deathmatch wrestling.",

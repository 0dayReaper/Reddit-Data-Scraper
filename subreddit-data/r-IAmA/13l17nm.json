    "postText": "Hello Reddit, I've been around here for a while and have seen some posts lately that could use the input from someone actually in the field of consumer protection. Of the government agencies, consumer protection and weights &amp; measures consistently gets top scores for \"do we really need this program\". Everyone likes making sure they aren't cheated! It's also one of the oldest occupations since the Phoenicians developed the alphabet and units of measure for trade. From the cubit to the pound to the kilo, weights and measures has been around.\n\nI am actually getting ready for a community outreach event with my department today and thought this would be a great way to test my knowledge and answer some questions. My daily responsibilities include testing gas pumps, certifying truck scales and grocery scales, price verification inspections, and checking packaging and labeling of consumer commodities. There are many things out there most people probably don't even know gets routinely checked.. laundry dryer timers? Aluminum can recyclers? Home heating oil trucks? Try me!\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/LXn8MtJ\n\nEdit: I'm getting busy at work but will answer all questions later tonight!\n\nEdit: I caught up with more questions. Our event yesterday went great! Thanks!\n\nI wanted to add from another W&amp;M related topic I saw on Reddit a few weeks ago, since all of you seem to be pretty interested in this stuff. Let's talk ice cream! Ice cream is measured in volume. Why? Because there is an exemption in the statutes that the method of sale is volume and not weight, due to lobbying from the industry. That's why the market is flooded now with air-whipped \"ice cream\". Many industries have their own lobbies that affect how these things are enforced. Half of the handbooks we use are exemptions some industry lobbied for.",

Usually they're dead empty, other times there's a line of trucks half a mile long. \n\nFirst, what determines whether those stations need to be open, and/or what determines if trucks need to stop or not?\n\nSecond, do the trucks pull up with a sheet of paper that says \"I'm carrying X lbs\" and basically get it matched against a scale in the road?",

States like Texas almost never have open weigh stations, but states like Utah and Wyoming will be open 24/7. \n\nSome weigh stations have highway signals that can tell individual trucks to bypass the station or not. But nowadays almost every truck has what's called a preclearance system like PrePass or Drivewyze. These are inside the teuck and will alert the drivers if they can bypass the station or not. Does this mean that the weigh station knows the truck is good on its weight? Not necessarily. Sometimes, it's random. Sometimes, companies have a good track record and get more bypasses than others. Sometimes weigh stations have a \"weigh in motion\" scale built into the road a little ways up before the weigh station that gets a general idea if your axles are overweight or not and then tells your preclear system to send you into the weigh station. \n\nAs for the \"I'm carrying x lbs\" sheet, it's called a Bill of Lading. Generally, the weights listed on them are a ballpark figure. I'm not sure about tanker trucks and other hazmat loads, but with regular freight, I've almost never got an exact weight measure from shippers. Most of the time, when you enter a weigh station and get scaled, the station staff will never see your BOL unless they call you in to check it. Which usually means you are getting an inspection. They just want to see that the axles and total weight of your truck is within the limits. \n\n80,000 lbs max for the whole truck and load. 12,000 lbs for the front steer axle. 34,000 lbs for the drive axle tandems together. And 34,000 lbs for the rear tandem set on the trailer. If you have a flatbed trailer where the rear tandems are split apart, you are allowed 20,000 lbs on each axle, bringing the total to 40,000 lbs for that trailer.\n\nOther states have their own laws. Like in Michigan you can go over 80k if you have more axles to distribute the weight.",

My state inspector just happened to be working with me one day during an inspection and told me there was an opening and I should apply.\n\nOther inspectors have come from all over. Some from the petroleum field, others from engineering firms. It's one of those jobs that has very few openings and the ones that get in will be there for 40 years until they retire.

There is no Federal W&amp;M agency, but the handbooks we all base our state programs off of is from the National Conference of Weights and Measures (NCWM). I say this because my state is known as a consumer protection forward state. Some other agencies are... lacking? \n\nI would never find a station in my state that routinely shorts customers. You fail an inspection, you get it fixed. If they don't, we shut the station down.\n\nAlso, it is next to impossible for stations today to intentionally doctor their pump meters as they are all electronic and need to be adjusted by a technician and a computer. The old mechanical meters could be messed with by changing gears, but many gas station owners today wouldn't even know how to open their pumps. The biggest thing you should be worried about in those \"no name\" stations is water in their tanks, because again that just comes down to negligence.",

The ones I used to do were mechanical with a little wheel then you had to seal it with a lead seal with your initials stamped into it so it couldn\u2019t be tampered with. Meters drift over time with use to the point where they make special meters with less drift for higher volume truck stop pumps. \n\nWater is a problem but ATG (automatic tank gauge) can tell you the levels. They even have a new product that continually sucks out water in the tank (only holds like 5 gallons)\n\nOne thing to note is avoid filling up when they are dropping a new load of fuel as that will kick up all the debris and rust and all that. And watch where you fill up and old site probably has old tanks which rust and get very nasty. I try and go to newer sites as much as I can. It\u2019s crazy some tanks have been in the ground 50 years.",

Yes, they exist.\n\nTwo things you can look for are accuracy class and NTEP certification. These aren't necessary for just a plain kitchen scale, but are required for Legal for Trade use. A normal grocery scale is a Class III scale with a NTEP certificate of conformity. You can check on the NCWM CC database search to verify a scale is actually certified instead of a counterfeit.\n\nAll that aside, it will add 10x the cost (my brother, an engineer, says NIST is a racket to overcharge for a certificate - two ways of looking at it). If you are just using it to portion meals in a home kitchen, anything is close enough. I've tested my cheap kitchen scale with my calibration weights and it's just fine.\n\nYou can search for certified test weights if you really want to check it out, but they aren't cheap.

I know my field standards wouldn't come anywhere close to what they need for calibration.\n\nEdit: quote from HB105 \"Field standards used for legal metrology shall be traceable to national standards by calibration in a laboratory recognized by NIST Office of Weights and Measures or accredited to ISO/IEC 17025 to calibrate in that parameter, range, and scope as specified by local regulations. Laboratories performing calibrations to establish traceability must comply with the calibration requirements of the applicable ASTM or OIML documentary standard.

The once every few months we have department meetings we all get some time to chat. I always take a few minutes to stop and talk to another inspector if I pass a station they are working at.\n\nWe shuffle inspectors around often when someone retires, often just moving to better parts of the state. If I retired, I'm sure another inspector would just take over my territory from somewhere else because they like the area better. New hired inspectors usually end up then with the territory nobody wants.\n\nFavorite part of the job? It is nice getting a follow-up from a business I wrote up, showing they fixed their QC process, and thanked me for bringing the issue to their attention. As I mentioned before, most failures are negligence or ignorance. I had one company from 5 states away I sent a warning letter to and spent the next month emailing back and forth with their President trying to nail down a production line that was sending out short-weight product. But really, I just like talking about my job. Without fail, every day I am out in the field someone will start asking me questions. I love the old retired guys who crack jokes and thank me for the work I do. It reminds me of my grandfather who used to tell me as a kid all the time whenever we saw some guy out working, \"hey, go ask that guy what he's doing?\"",

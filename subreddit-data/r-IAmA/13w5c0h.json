It's not our job to impose our own morals onto patients, we shouldn't get in between them and their doctor. It's our responsibility to dispense prescriptions and that's what we should do. So yeah, I think that's wrong. \n\nWith that said there are plenty of instances where the pharmacist catches something wrong with a prescription, perhaps it interacts negetivly with something their taking or for some other reason would be unsafe for them to take. Usually we contact the doctor and sort it out with them before the patient comes to pick it up, sometimes though it means they need to wait longer. If a pharmacist chooses not to dispense something for a medical reason based on their judgment, I think that's fair.\n\nThere's also safety reasons to do so, we don't dispense schedule II controlled substances without photo ID for instance. That's not the law but it's what our pharmacy manager feels comfortable doing. I also think that's fair.",

We did the same thing with covid tests while those were covered by insurance. Personally though on the day to day it doesn't effect me as much, I just come in do my job and do it well. But as you said being understaffed, underfunded while being given increasingly higher expectations and responsibilities really sucks, I can understand why you left retail.",

Technicians are the driving force of any good pharmacy.\n\nYea one of the reasons I left was only having a part time tech for 4 hours a day so opening and closing by myself was hard as well as manning the drive through and weekends alone.  Union had me waive my lunch to be able to work through it without closing the pharmacy too.  It was a low volume store but one small issue like a family of 6 coming in all wanting flu shots when you\u2019re all alone could quickly turn into a nightmare.  \n\nAnd I hated having to have a quota on patients signing up for credit cards\u2026",

That's sounds awful, glad I don't have to deal with that.\n\nYeah flu shots are a nightmare, vaccines in general just slow everything down so much. The pharmacists open and close on their own so I can imagine how precarious that could get.\n\nAlso damn seriously with the lunches? My pharmacy manager doesn't take lunches either of her own choice because she feels too behind to take time off. This week I think she was there for 14 hours straight several days due too needing to get some things done, our state just passed some new regulations we need to follow. It's crazy, can't believe that's allowed.\n\nCongrats on escaping the hell that is retail lol. I don't mind it much as a tech but no way would I want to be here as a pharmacist.",

But my coworker finds the job alot more tedious than I do lol, so everyone is different.\n\nI do think it depends on the pharmacy, also the people you work with. I really enjoy my coworkers so obviously that makes it better. My pharmacy is also fairly quiet, we serve an older population so not as many problems.

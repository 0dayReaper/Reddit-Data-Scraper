We believe the FCC didn't justify its action with any real facts for abandoning Title II classification for broadband ISPs. Then there are the huge problems with the FCC's process in this proceeding like not meaningfully engaging with the comments and not giving adequate notice about their plan to kill all the rules save some weaksauce transparency provisions. For starters that is. ",

                            "comment": "First off, I would like to say thank you guys. As a lawyer myself, I think this is one of the most righteous causes to fight for at the moment, and if you guys would ever like assistance from a lawyer who has a background in electrical engineering, has done legal work for telecommunications companies, and has a strong understanding of con law, please let me know and I'd be happy to help out.\n\nSecond, I know that you responded to a follow-up question below, but I have a more nuanced question that I'd like to ask.  You say that the FCC failed to properly follow the APA. What sections and/or clauses of the APA are you asserting that they failed to follow? More specifically, can you tell me what legal arguments you would make in response to this comment by /u/InquisitorialRetinue posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/7josxi/18_attorneys_general_ask_fcc_to_delay_net/dr8enu4/) and reproduced below.\n\n&gt; Based on what procedural mandate, and on what theory? The AGs can\u2019t even cite the APA correctly (\u201cProcedure\u201d is not plural). How is this different from interest groups urging the writing of form letters to an agency making identical points, most of which are disregarded by agency staff anyway? (The agency need only consider a significant point, not its redundant iterations.)\n\n&gt; For one, it\u2019s not a popularity contest. See, e.g., U.S. Cellular Corp. v. FCC, 254 F.3d 78, 87 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (an agency \u201chas no obligation to take the approach advocated by the largest number of commenters\u201d and \u201cmay adopt a course endorsed by no commenter.\u201d). For two, the APA \u201chas never been interpreted to require the agency to respond to every comment, or to analyse every issue or alternative raised by the comments, no matter how insubstantial.\u201d Thompson v. Clark, 741 F.2d 401, 408 (D.C. Cir. 1984); see also Vermont Yankee (\u201cadministrative proceedings should not be a game or a forum to engage in unjustified obstructionism by making cryptic and obscure reference to matters that \u2018ought to be\u2019 considered and then, after failing to do more to bring the matter to the agency\u2019s attention, seeking to have that agency determination vacated on the ground that the agency failed to consider matters \u2018forcefully presented.\u2019\u201d).\n\n&gt; Here, the AGs point to comment spam, but then don\u2019t elaborate on how they are material to the validity of the proposed rule. They don\u2019t even articulate a theory! Sure sounds to me like cryptic obstruction of the Vermont Yankee variety.\n\nWhile this comment is pointed at halting/pausing the vote on the repeal due to the allegedly fraudulent comments, the cited case law (as well as precedential case law such as Citizen's United) does make a compelling argument in favor of the FCC. And, as an engineer, given the standard of arbitrary and capricious, it seems like the FCC has provided enough information to jump that incredibly low hurdle. So while I think it's the wrong outcome, the law does seem to indicate that the FCC will win.\n\nLong story short, I would like to know how you all are planning to respond to those rules and arguments and what other legal theories/arguments you are planning on posing.\n\nThanks!",

This preponderance is based on the more convincing evidence and its probable truth or accuracy, and not on the amount of evidence. Thus, one clearly knowledgeable witness may provide a preponderance of evidence over a dozen witnesses with hazy testimony, or a signed agreement with definite terms may outweigh opinions or speculation about what the parties intended. Preponderance of the evidence is required in a civil case and is contrasted with \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" which is the more severe test of evidence required to convict in a criminal trial. No matter what the definition stated in various legal opinions, the meaning is somewhat subjective.\n\nlink: http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1586\n",

Republicans are dead set on making this a partisan issue even though their base overwhelmingly supports net neutrality. We might stand a better chance in the courts. Of course, if we do win and Republicans are still in charge I guarantee you they're just going to ram their own version of the repeal into law. The money never runs out so they're never going to stop trying. Slowly realizing that this is the America we live in now.",

It requires a simple majority in the House and Senate. Given that several Republicans have already come out publicly criticizing the FCC plan, and the level of public backlash we're seeing, we think that'd doable. But we'll need to keep the momentum that we have now up. So go to https://www.battleforthenet.com and contact your lawmakers with this new message. We can still win this.",

But I don't think any ISP in their right mind would do that because they would either be facing riots or hemorrhaging customers. (Edit: see edit below) \n\nBlocking information in the internet allows ISPs to manipulate and groom their customers for whatever agenda they want. This is beyond just a politics. This is a violation of 1st amendment rights. \n\nAre you guys thinking along these lines?\n\n**Edit**\n\nOkay to clarify - they may not be hemorrhaging customers, but if you do anything to take entertainment away from Americans you will not have a good time. Its like the kid that wants candy at the grocery store. They are gonna start yelling and screaming to make a scene. \n\nBut my main point here is people seem so fixated on the Netflix/Fb/etc. But the real problem is that ISPs can now control knowledge/information. Now apply Murhy's law. \n",

In fact, we are where we are today because the ISPs kept challenging the FCC's Net Neutrality regulations in court over the last decade. The ISPs have won this round at the FCC but turnabout is fair play and we'll undoubtably challenge the agency on some of the same grounds they did. \n\nAs far as timing - we can't go to court until the FCC's decision is published in the federal register so this whole thing will kick off sometime early next year. And then it could be a year or more until its resolved. ",

Primarily a) it's going to help competition b) the examples of NN violations in the past were over-exaggerate and/or eventually fixed themselves and c) fast lanes and zero ratings aren't that big of a deal and won't really hinder innovation. I'm curious what the counter-counter argument would be. Secondly, will it be legal for comcast (for example) to throttle all other services other than NBC or would that be considered anti-competitive? Thanks! ",

                    "comment": "&gt;a) it's going to help competition\n\nThere's actually been a historic level of investment since the 2015 order. We've catalogued that here: https://www.freepress.net/press-release/108079/its-working-free-press-documents-historic-levels-investment-and-innovation-fccs\n\nWe've also heard that argument and I just can't connect the dots on that one. I'd have you challenge or investigate the claim that giving ISPs the power to block, throttle or create fast lanes increases competition. It'll likely work to create an incumbency protection racket where ISPs can work with big content providers to secure fast lanes thereby relegating start ups to a worse and harder to access tier of the internet. \n\n&gt;b) the examples of NN violations in the past were over-exaggerate and/or eventually fixed themselves\n\nHere's a list of notable violations. https://www.freepress.net/blog/2017/04/25/net-neutrality-violations-brief-history\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that these violations occurred in an environment where the FCC was committed to overseeing the behaviors and protecting consumers from the unfair practices of ISPs (whether that was under a Title I or Title II regime). Today the FCC has said it will completely abdicate its oversight role over ISPs. It's a whole new chapter in the ISP shenanigan game. \n\n&gt;c) fast lanes and zero ratings aren't that big of a deal and won't really hinder innovation\n\nThese practices distort the market and encourage further consolidation. We're now in a world where a company like Comcast owns both access to the network and is a huge content creator (NBC) as well. Under the new regime Comcast can privilege its own affiliated content crowding out newcomers and other media.  \n\n&gt;Secondly, will it be legal for comcast (for example) to throttle all other services other than NBC or would that be considered anti-competitive?\n\nLet's call this an open question. I'll note that this kind of anti-trust litigation can take years during which companies like Comcast can reap the benefits of gaming the network. This is why bright line rules are better than post-hoc enforcement. ",

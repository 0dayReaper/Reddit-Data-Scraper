You might remember my colleagues Greg, Marjorie, and Tim from previous AMAs on protecting [bees](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3l2tbr/im_an_attorney_for_the_beekeeping_industry_who/) and [wolves](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/). Earthjustice is a public interest law firm that uses the power of the courts to safeguard Americans\u2019 air, water, health, wild places, and wild species. \n\nWe\u2019re very busy. Donald Trump has tried to do more [harm to the environment](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/donald-trump-100-days-president-climate-change-global-warming-nature-catastrophic-dangerous-weird-a7701906.html) in his first 100 days than any other president in history. The New York Times recently published a list of [23 environmental rules](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/02/climate/environmental-rules-reversed-trump-100-days.html?_r=4) the Trump administration has attempted to roll back, including limits on greenhouse gas emissions, new standards for energy efficiency, and even a regulation that stopped coal companies from dumping untreated waste into mountain streams.  \n\nEarthjustice has filed a steady stream of lawsuits against Trump. So far, we\u2019ve filed or are preparing litigation to stop the administration from, among other things:\n\n* gutting protections for 27 [national monuments](http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2017/trump-puts-america-s-national-monuments-on-trial-with-latest-executive-order)\n* [re-opening](http://earthjustice.org/blog/2017-april/trump-brings-arctic-offshore-drilling-back-from-the-dead-and-it-s-still-a-terrible-idea) the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to oil drilling\n* [fast-tracking](http://www.earthjustice.org/news/press/2017/earthjustice-condemns-president-trump-s-presidential-memorandum-on-keystone-xl-and-dakota-access-oil-pipelines) the [Dakota Access pipeline](http://earthjustice.org/features/teleconference-standing-rock)\n* resuming [coal mining](http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2017/groups-filing-lawsuit-over-trump-s-order-to-open-thousands-of-acres-to-public-lands-coal-leasing) on public land\n* allowing use of the dangerous pesticide [chlorpyrifos](http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2017/groups-appeal-epa-s-refusal-to-ban-major-pesticide-linked-to-brain-damage-in-children) on food crops\n* letting coal companies pollute [drinking water sources](http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2017/groups-sue-to-block-trump-rollback-of-safeguards-for-america-s-worst-toxic-water-pollution-source)\n* stalling national efforts to fight climate change, including the [Clean Power Plan](http://earthjustice.org/blog/2017-march/executive-orders-take-aim-at-climate-safeguards) \n\nMy specialty is defending our country\u2019s wildlands, oceans, and wildlife in court from fossil fuel extraction, over-fishing, habitat loss, and other threats. Ask me about how our team plans to counter Trump\u2019s anti-environment agenda, which flies in the face of the needs and wants of voters. Almost 75 percent of Americans, including 6 in 10 Trump voters, [support](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/) regulating climate changing pollution.\n\nIf you feel moved to support Earthjustice\u2019s work, please consider [taking action](http://earthjustice.org/action&amp;utm_source=redditama&amp;s_src=redditama_actionsignup) for one of our causes or [making a donation](https://secure.earthjustice.org/site/Donation2?df_id=17348&amp;17348.donation=form1&amp;mfc_pref=T).

By themselves, they actually *do* nothing. They pretty much just order other people to do things-these other people are members of the federal bureaucracy.\n\n Heads of branches of the federal bureaucracy are appointed by the president according to merit and usually cannot be fired without a very long and difficult process. They then hire the people under them, who also would have to go through such process,which means most of the federal bureaucracy is still consistent of President Obama's administrative appointments and hirings. They are the people who pretty much *do* everything in the country. The bureaucracy retains something called discretionary authority, basically, if they do not agree with/do not want to/cannot follow the provisions of an executive order, piece of legislation, or decision from a federal court, they do not have to. Period. They have discretion over what they do. So, President Trump's executive orders, for the most part, have not been and most likely will not be carried out by the federal bureaucracy. Which renders them nearly ineffective. \n\nExecutive orders can be overridden or supported by legislation from Congress. In this case, the bureaucracy will generally follow the provisions of the law since legal action could occur if an unfortunate series of events happens for a specific member or agency, but again the likelihood is rare that they will do something they don't wish to do. \n\nFinally, executive actions, which include executive orders, may be taken to the Supreme Court to be declared unconstitutional. This is ultimately what OP is trying to achieve, and it is very, very difficult to do. To me, it does not seem likely he will make it that far. Especially with the flooding of cases the Supreme Court is probably taking on right now and the fact that the Supreme Court's term is ending in 2 months and OP has to first go through multiple stages of local and federal courts. But it is possible. Executive orders will be overridden by the Supreme Court only if they find that the action, in some way, violates any portion of the Constitution. But again, if the executive branch does not agree, they legally could continue to do what they were doing with very little chance of punishment.      \n\nEdit: I just woke up. I'll answer everybody in a few hours! ",

A few of them have actually done something substantive, like the executive order purporting to reverse President Obama\u2019s withdrawal of most of the Arctic and part of the Atlantic Oceans from availability for offshore oil drilling (about which we promptly sued the president).  But many of the other executive orders have looked more like excuses to hold a media event, because an executive order wasn\u2019t necessary to accomplish what the executive order did.  For example, last month the president signed an executive order mandating a review of previous presidents\u2019 designation of national monuments.  National monument designations are incredibly valuable, so President Trump shouldn\u2019t be questioning them.  But all the executive order did was order the Interior Department to do an internal review about the monument designations.  The president didn\u2019t need to sign an executive order to accomplish such a review.  Heck, he could have had a White House intern call the Interior Department and convey the directive to do the review that way.  It\u2019s hard not to read executive orders like that as an exercise in posturing to a small number of anti-monument idealogues.",

They cannot be used to CREATE Law.\n\nThis is the rub. Congress \"delegated\" SOME Power to the President, but not ALL Power regarding OCSLA. Pres. Obama was acting within the Law (Clarifying, using delegated Power). Pres. Trump is NOT Clarifying existing Law, nor acting in Absence of Law. His act is \"technically\" Creating new law, because Congress did not grant this specific ability (to remove something from protection).\n\nThis is a \"nuanced\" interpretation, which will likely fail.\n\nThe Executive has always had the ability to revoke previous Executive Orders, because they are NOT Law. He has these Powers because Legislation is SLOW and IMPRECISE, therefore he can react quickly, whereas normally he would have to wait for Congress to re-write Law.",

No permit, no exploration or drilling. Things like that happen.  ",

How they override him is up to them, but they certainly have the power to do it (given his actions are not lawful or he does not have the power to do).",

That is an injustice, especially coming in the wake of centuries of injustice perpetrated against Native Americans.  Finally, if we already have as many pipelines as you suggest, we certainly don\u2019t need another one that will have to be paid for by many years of increased fossil fuel production.  Instead, we need to move toward cleaner and smarter energy, for economic as well as environmental reasons. ",

The original pipeline path was supposed to cross the river just upstream of Bismarck, North Dakota, but it was moved to just upsteam of the reservation.

Shouldn't a lawyer filing such a lawsuit know if there are other pipelines there or not?\n\n&gt; ...we certainly don\u2019t need another one... \n\nWhy not? It sounds like you're presupposing that any pipeline is bad. But why? My understanding is that it's safer to move oil through a pipe than by rail or road. With that in mind, wouldn't another pipeline be a good thing?\n\n&gt; ...that will have to be paid for by many years of increased fossil fuel production.\n\nWell, the oil's getting pumped out one way or the other. The existing transportation arrangements are already permitting a large amount of fossil fuel production. Perhaps the pipeline will make it economically viable to pump more oil - but, again, it'll make transporting that oil safer, so environmentally it sounds like a wash.\n\n&gt; ...we need to move toward cleaner and smarter energy, for economic as well as environmental reasons. \n\nIf \"clean\" energy was more economical, then you wouldn't need a lawsuit to get people to take it up.\n\nIn sum, what's the big deal?",

In order to file a lawsuit, you have to have a personal stake in the matter.  In the Arctic drilling cases, our clients are organizations whose members use the Arctic Ocean for fishing or whale watching or a host of other activities that would be harmed if there was a giant oil spill in the Arctic Ocean, one of the worst places in the world to have an oil spill.  That potential harm to our clients\u2019 interests is what gives them legal standing to sue.  And that legal doctrine allows our clients to hold the federal government accountable for following the law by taking the government to court.  It\u2019s an incredibly important and valuable system of checks and balances that forces the government to be accountable to ordinary citizens.",

But this is an ongoing issue that is being raised in many cases.\n\nIn the scenario you raised, you need to show that lifting the Act caused your lung problems.

You are correct that shipping via train, truck, ship is worse for the environment than by pipeline. BUT, fighting pipelines is not directly about the pipeline itself. It's about the externalities of building a pipeline.\n\nThe biggest and most relevant of these is that pipelines are expensive to build. Companies sink a lot of money into building one and often take out pretty substantial loans to fund their construction. The issue with building the pipeline is that the company and investors in the pipeline will then use it to justify greater drilling/oil sands mining, etc. over the next 10-20 years to recoup their investment. Even as the market shifts toward renewable energy sources, these investors and the banks have a vested interest in keeping the pipeline operating at full capacity and in ensuring that legislation on the states the pipeline passes through will support this. 10 years from now, this pipeline will be used to justify remaining oil-dependent and reducing infrastructure investments in renewable energy sources. It will be used as a tool to lobby against renewable investments by the states it passes through.\n\nThat doesn't mean we shouldn't build the pipeline. But these externalities have to be considered as part of the decision.\n\n&gt; How can someone prevent construction on private property they do not own and have no legal rights to?\n\nI assume by demonstrating potential for harm to public lands or their adjacent lands. By analyzing the risks, likelihood of occurrence, etc. they can estimate the potential harm and demonstrate that they either deserve compensation for the losses due to those risks. Outside of that, I have no idea.",

While I 100% agree with you on the other topics, and I even acknowledge the dangers and detriments to the environment that Arctic drilling will have, it's not like other nations are simply going to let it sit untapped. Though perhaps I am misunderstanding something, which is in fact why I'm asking the question.

Arctic weather is extreme. It's dark for months at a time. Cold water holds more CO2 than warm water, making it more corrosive because of the carbolic acid that forms when CO2 is dissolved in water.  The Arctic is literally one of the hardest and most dangerous places to drill, before even factoring in the environmental damage a spill would cause.",

I just wanted to say that lawyers like you, and those who I have worked for, you are all heroes. \n\nAs for a question: what skill or resource do you think environmental lawyers underutilize throughout their careers?

We represent hundreds of environmental groups every year, but we never charge for our legal services.  That means we give away for free millions of dollars of high quality legal services every year.  We\u2019re able to do so because of our supporters, who are critical members of the Earthjustice team.  If you\u2019re already supporting Earthjustice, thank you for making our work possible!  If you\u2019re not yet a supporter but are interested in what we do, please consider [joining us](https://secure.earthjustice.org/site/Donation2?df_id=17348&amp;17348.donation=form1&amp;mfc_pref=T).\n\nIn some cases in which we file and win lawsuits against the federal government, we can recover attorney fees from the federal government.  But those attorney fee recoveries are only a small part of our budget (around five percent or less).  The great bulk of our budget comes from our wonderful donors, who make everything we do possible.

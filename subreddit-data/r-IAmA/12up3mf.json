I\u2019ll start combing through and get back to everybody!\n\nAlso feel free to sub to r/ATC_Hiring . I made that sub a few years ago to be a place for people to keep in touch while going through the hiring process.\n\n[Proof](https://imgur.com/gallery/eYEOQju)\n\nI\u2019ve been doing AMA\u2019s for these \u201coff the street\u201d hiring announcements since 2018. Since they always gain a lot of interest, I\u2019m back for another one. I\u2019ve heard back from *hundreds* of people (if not thousands at this point) over the past few years who saw my posts, applied, and are now air traffic controllers. Hopefully this post can reach someone else who might be looking for a cool job which happens to also pay really well. \n\nCheck out my previous AMAs for *a ridiculous amount* of info:\n\n[2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v99b50/i_am_an_air_traffic_controller_two_weeks_from/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=1)\n\n[2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ouykas/iaman_air_traffic_controller_today_the_faa_opened/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/et0g75/iaman_air_traffic_controller_tomorrow_the_faa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/bsbndl/iaman_air_traffic_controller_this_time_last_year/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8kwxk3/iaman_air_traffic_controller_the_faa_will_be/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n** This year the application window will open from ***May 5 - May 8*** for all eligible U.S. citizens.**\n\nEligibility requirements are as follows:\n\n- Must be a U.S. citizen\n\n- Must be registered for Selective Service, if applicable (Required for males born after 12/31/1959)\u00a0\n\n- Must be age 30 or under on the closing date of the application period (with limited exceptions)\n\n- Must have either three years of general work experience or four years of education leading to a bachelor\u2019s degree, or a combination of both\n\n- Must speak English clearly enough to be understood over communications equipment\n\n**- Be willing to relocate to an FAA facility based on agency staffing needs**\n\n[START HERE](https://www.faa.gov/be-atc) to visit the FAA website and read up on the application process and timeline, training, pay, and more. Here you will also find detailed instructions on *how to apply*.\n\n[MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS](https://www.aviationmedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Medical-Standards-for-Terminal-and-En-Route-Centers-for-ATC-Positions%C2%A0FAA-Brochure.pdf)\n\nLet\u2019s start with the difficult stuff: \n\nThe hiring process is *incredibly* arduous. After applying, you will have to wait for the FAA to process all applications, determine eligibility, and then reach out to you to schedule the AT-SA. This process typically takes a couple months. The AT-SA is essentially an air traffic aptitude test. The testing window usually lasts another couple months until everyone is tested. Your score will place you into one of several \u201cbands\u201d, the top of which being \u201cBest Qualified.\u201d I don\u2019t have stats, but from my understanding the vast majority of offer letters go to those whose scores fall into that category. \n\nIf you receive and accept an offer letter (called a Tentative Offer Letter, or TOL) you will then have to pass medical and security clearance, including:\n\n- Drug testing\n\n- Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI2)\n\n- Class II medical exam\n\n- Fingerprinting\n\n- Federal background check\n\nOnce you clear the medical and security phase you will receive a Final Offer Letter (FOL) with instructions on when/where to attend the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City, OK.\n\nDepending on which track you are assigned (Terminal or En Route), you will be at the academy for 3-4 months (paid). You will have to pass your evaluations at the end in order to continue on to your facility. **There is a 99% chance you will have to relocate.** Your class will get a list of available facilities to choose from based solely on national staffing needs. If you fail your evaluations, your position will be terminated. Once at your facility, on the job training typically lasts anywhere from 1-3 years. You will receive substantial raises as you progress through training. \n\n**All that being said:**\n\nThis is an *incredibly* rewarding career. The median pay for air traffic controllers in 2021 was **$138,556** (I don\u2019t have the number from 2022). We receive extremely competitive benefits and leave, and won\u2019t work a day past 56 (mandatory retirement, **with a pension**). We also get **3 months of paid parental leave**. Most controllers would tell you they can\u2019t imagine doing anything else. Enjoying yourself at work is actively encouraged, as taking down time in between working traffic is paramount for safety. Understand that not all facilities are well-staffed and working conditions can vary greatly. But overall, it\u2019s hard to find a controller who wouldn\u2019t tell you this is the best job in the world. \n\nPlease ask away in the comments and/or my DMs. I always respond to everyone eventually. Good luck!",

The pilot, obviously, for clearly not meeting a good working knowledge of English, and the controller (albeit to a lesser degree) for using phrases that can be confused due to language/radio interference/etc. which they are supposed to be trained to avoid using.",

Going back a few years -- Korea, 1970-1 -- I was with the 284^th AVN ATC attached to 8^th Army HQ. Technically I was 93K20 (Enroute Approach; sort of like ARTCC), but we all ended up working tower (93H20).\n\nWhen I arrived in late 1970, our tower radios were absolute crap. This was at H201, the VIP helipad for 8^th Army HQ, so you would think they would go the extra mile. Nah, this was the Army. \n\nThen one day Robo arrived. His last name was Wrobowski (I think), but the controllers considered him to be a good friend of the Radio Gods. He did nothing by the book, but suddenly our radios were performing like Chinese acrobats. Saying the difference was night and day is a massive understatement.\n\nThere are many wild and weird stories involving Robo, but as the song says, \"You don't know what you've got til it's gone.\" When Robo finally rotated home, we got a new Spec 6 running Commo and he did *everything* by the book. Our radios went from Heaven to Hell in about 2 weeks. God I missed Robo.",

UHF is mostly LOS (Line of Sight), and VHF only slightly less so.\n\nTo our north was *Nam San* (South Mountain) which totally blocked signals from that direction. This was not too much of a problem because there was prohibited airspace (around the Presidential Palace), ground to unlimited, starting about 200' north of our northern boundary. Meaning we *never* had aircraft coming from that direction.\n\nTo our east was a ~150' hill with an elementary school on it. He looked at putting a remote antenna up there, but there were problems both technical and political with that. So another block.\n\nTo the west was Officer Country (i.e. family housing). That was prohibited under 5,000', so we didn't use it for a traffic pattern. We had good LOS, but we had iffy signal strength/quality depending on what frequency we were on. Predictably, the most problems were on our primary tower frequency. To the south we had both good LOS and signal quality.\n\nThe problem was that easily 60% of our traffic was coming from the west following the Han River. And that's where the \"iffy signal\" came into play.\n\nRobo spent a couple of weeks walking/driving around with radios and test meters trying to identify the source of the problem (not your average spec 5 commo guy). He never exactly nailed it, but he did have a map where he drew contours showing areas of signal strength/quality.\n\nThe problem was something in Officer Country that was both electrically and *magnetically*(?) active, causing both static and a 'drifting signal'(?). He dealt with part of it by using some sort of homemade RF bandpass filter, and suddenly about 80% of our static disappeared. The only solution he could figure for the other problem was a signal relay from our southern border, where the problem didn't manifest. This involved an oddly-shaped antenna + electro-magical stuff that only Robo understood.\n\nThese 2 things took our signal from the west from about a 3x2 to 5x5. It might not have been by the book, but for about 9 months it was glorious. And then he rotated home, some details of which are part of my yet-to-be-written magnum opus: 'Part I: [Orange Sunshine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALD-52#History) Kimchi -- Fear and Loathing in Itaewon' and 'Part II: Robo goes insane' (alternate title: 'Wrobowski the Destroyer').",

Good luck if you weren't close by.\n\nPlus, the \"we pay you during your training\" is 25k PER YEAR. So you have to be fine with 3 to 4 months of that pay while living in Oklahoma City, OK. Housing isn't included nor is transportation. So you better hope you can find a cheap option as the ones listed as common options are extended stay motels or house rentals where the prices were around 1200-1500 per month. This is before all of your other bills for transportation and anything else. \n\nOn top of this, the training starts at their leisure which means that if you aren't living with others who are willing to let you leave whenever, you are likely paying termination fees. \n\nPlus, once you do graduate, the salary isn't 6 figures.

If you get tower, you\u2019ll end up at a mid\u2014range facility out of the academy. Once you certify, you can try to transfer to another facility, where you\u2019ll have to go through some more training to learn the local airspace, SOP, etc. \n\nIf you get hired for en route, you\u2019ll go to one of the 21 centers once you graduate the academy.

A couple of things, you would want to end one pay period on the books for agency A and start with agency B the very next day. Why? Because you can get save pay. You could retain your pay until your ATC catches up to or passes what you were making before the transfer. While training at the academy your pay is low to start but you get per diem and big pay raises along the way in training. If you have a break in service you do not get this benefit.\n\nYour federal time would count toward earning more leave, the 3, 5, 15 year milestones. Your federal time would count toward retirement. For ATC it is 1.7% for the first 20 years and 1% after that. Non-ATC time would add 1% per year of service. Lastly federal service time is a tie breaker in seniority if you join the agency at the same time as someone else and end up at the same ATC facility.",

A Marine MV-22 Osprey was still out and had to come back because they had 30 minutes of fuel left which is usually fine in good weather but visibility was absolute shit so we were a little nervous. They didn\u2019t make it on to the boat on their first two attempts and by the 2nd attempt was over we were already spinning up additional SAR helicopters for when they inevitably fall out of the sky into the freezing cold ocean. The pilot/copilot we\u2019re getting audibly shook up and every transmission they made ended with a quiet sigh but our Final controller was in extreme focus mode and pretty much at the last minute, they got the guys on board and everybody in Radar pretty much went into celebration mode. Probably the first and only time I ever saw all of Radar and the adjacent work centers (CIC, TACRON, and Tactical Logistics) in one single tiny room watching one guy work his magic. The pilots even came into Radar and gave the guy a hug saying he saved their lives and explaining how terrifying it was how they could barely see anything in front of them so they had to trust their instruments and ATC.",

Totally different story, but I have a few horror stories. \n\nFirst one was the least harmful. I was in training on the radar. I had a fully certified and very tenured controller watching my every move and would have intervened had he thought it necessary. But this dude was chill as fuck and not once keyed over me. I was really busy, but doing pretty well. At some point a pilot keyed onto my frequency and I couldn\u2019t find him anywhere on my scope. My heart dropped into my stomach. I pulled up his data block. He was in the sector over, but the hand off had been made. He was totally fine. I had just forgotten so switch communications with him. These things do happen, but that was a feeling of pure terror. I cried myself to sleep that night. \n\nOnce we were working an American Airlines flight from DFW to Cancun, and he was northwest of Austin when the pilot keyed up and said there was smoke in the cockpit. We were able to safely get him to San Antonio, but the fear in the pilot\u2019s voice definitely stuck with me. \n\nI worked in QA (quality assurance) for a year or two, in which the \u201ctapes get pulled\u201d for any time someone has had a safety incident. Everything on your screen and every transmission is recorded. So we were analyzing other peoples\u2019 fuck ups, and there were some doozies in there.",

I got as far as the security clearance (which if I passed that, meant ATC school acceptance) before I realized that anyone who had ever sought care for mental health, even if it is not a mental illness, would receive and automatic DQ. I had received therapy for about six months a few years prior. I had heard from other applicants that I could just lie and it's likely that they won't check my insurance records and I'd be fine. But it's also a felony if you get caught and they want to make an example of you. I decided to withdraw my application. \n\nI'm now disqualified from future hiring because I withdrew so late in the hiring process, but with the rise of mental health awareness in the country, along with the fact that many people seek therapy for things that aren't necessarily related to mental illness (mine was just mentally reconciling a break up), is seeking therapy still an automatic DQ within the FAA?",

Now that I *have* been diagnosed, and take medication to control those symptoms and function much more normally, I'm permanently disqualified from even being licensed to fly a Cessna.\n\nOP, I know you're doing a good thing here, and you've been helping people find ATC careers on Reddit for a long time.  But it's the aviation world's worst-kept secret that \"no pilot has ever been to therapy\", and people are very much encouraged to hide those kinds of issues if they have any interest in an aviation career.  There are even entire law firms and medical practices that specialize in fighting FAA medical disqualifications based on old, incorrect, or \"incorrect\" diagnoses.",

After thousands and thousands of dollars and multiple tests, I was \"approved\" for a brief moment, but the slightest hiccup sent me right back to the FAA for more tests, so I just quit. I'm a computer programmer now.\n\nWhen I talk to other pilots, it seems to be much more difficult if you were ever prescribed any sort of mental health medication (I never was). The FAA needs to seriously overhaul their entire attitude on mental health care.",

Is it done close to where you live or you have to travel somewhere? Second; what would you consider a good skillset to have, to do well in the application process tests? (Mathematics, critical thinking, logical reasoning etc?)",

I am a creative person and enjoy hobbies like painting and writing on a regular basis, as well as outdoorsy stuff like rock climbing and hiking. Would love to get your thoughts on that! Thanks for providing so much helpful info about becoming an ATC. Cheers!",

Makes sense to think about ways to force-multiply that staff to reduce burden, and to automate the process (within reason) to reduce turnover sensitivity.",

You were known for performing for up to three straight hours. My question is: was this to be able to play lengthy sets or was it primarily so musicians  could party - like if they got too high they could be swapped out for a more sober musician?\n\nTHANK YOU for keeping our society Funkadelic and inspiring so many of us musicians and funksters!!!!!!",

Three of four minutes later we saw it again two times, hit the street.  Then the light hit the car and the light turned to liquid like mercury from a thermometer, beaded up and rolled off the car.  All the street lights went out slowly as we passed.  We looked behind us it was dark. Bootsy wasn't scared, he thought I knew what was going on.  We weren't high, because he just crossed the border.  We eventually arrived home and walked in the house and my daughter said, you all acting like you just saw a ghost!  I didn't even think about it until later, why were we seeing light in daylight.  I had to call Bootsy to confirm what time of day it was.  We lost a lot of time that day and didn't realize it until years later.",

All of that album Free Your Mind was recorded under the influence, over the influence, and between the influence of LSD and trendy chemical substances.\n\n3.  I always enjoyed working with everyone.  I'd like to work with Cardi B.  She's got the funk.  And the new Jay Z album is the motherfucker.  I like the whole concept.  I might write off that shit. \n\n4. Oh shit.  71 probably.

When he said Bop Gun, I thought he was talking about Bop Gun I didn't realize until I got there that he was playing One Nation which is easier for me to do because I'm not trying to sing behind Glenn on Bop Gun.  They slowed it down a bit making it easier for me to sing.  It was the bomb.  In fact, he did a Remix of Ain't That Funkin Kinda Hard on You.  That shows you how much I depend on Ice Cube!  Thank you Ice Cube.\n\n3. I agree with Wizard of Finance.  I also like Happiness on Our Side by Bernie Worrell.  That whole album in the world is probably my favorite underrated album.",

    "postText": "We are cannabis lawyers at Gleam Law! We have offices in 8 states and serve clients around the world. We practice business law, administrative law, intellectual property, banking law, real estate, and litigation with a focus on cannabis.\n\nWe help businesses form, comply, and thrive in the new cannabis industry. Our clients include farms, processors, retailers, dispensaries, and ancillary businesses such as publicly traded companies and international celebrities.\n\nIn the emerging cannabis system, regulatory bodies are struggling to grasp the complex subject matter. We help the government offices interpret the laws in regards to the practical application and use of medical and recreational marijuana.\n\nThese are always fun and this is our seventh AMA! We are lawyers, but not your lawyers. Nothing stated here (by us) should be construed as legal advice\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/hxJ8oOc)!\n\nFun fact, one of Reddit\u2019s key investors in 2014 was Snoop Dogg. Happy 4/20, everyone!\n\nEdit - added attorney names.\n\nJoining us this time will be:\n\nNeil Juneja: I am the founder and managing partner of Gleam Law. I am a registered patent attorney and I think the world of myself. I am also famous for my modesty.\n\nJustin Walsh: I am a partner in our Seattle office. I lead the litigation department; advise businesses on Cannabis, hemp, and CBD regulations; and make a great cocktail. I am also the Cannabis Law professor at Seattle University and moonlight as a judge pro tem. In my off time, I tell jokes and write. You can also find me on the twitters at @amateurlawprof. [Edit: I am most definitely NOT on Twitter anymore]\n\nMia Getlin: I handle projects for Gleam Law in Oregon and advise clients on a wide range of issues, including compliance, licensing, and transactions. As part of an industry advocacy organization, I work closely with the legislature, the OLCC, and other offices and agencies in Oregon to effect changes to law and rule to benefit Oregon cannabis companies. When I am not at the office, I can be found wrangling my three small children or doing something dangerous in Oregon\u2019s great outdoors.\n\nHabib Bentaleb: I am a California-based cannabis attorney focusing on the business side of cannabis law. I commonly speak at industry events and help keep the legal community appraised on the latest issues in cannabis.\n\nAlan Hanson: I am a lawyer and the recognized cannabis credit union expert at Gleam Law based out of our Portland, OR office. My banking practice focuses on developing cannabis and hemp credit union divisions across many states including but not limited to Oregon, California, and Washington.\n\nRoger Goodman: I am one of the first Gleam Law attorneys and I specialize in regulatory compliance and government relations for cannabis businesses. I am also on my seventh term serving in the Washington State Legislature, presiding as Chair of the House Public Safety Committee with oversight of the criminal justice system. As a drug policy reformer for more than a decade, I was a key player in laying the groundwork for cannabis legalization in Washington State.\n\nKrishna Narine: I am a Mid-Atlantic cannabis business lawyer with boots on the ground in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. In addition to my cannabis practice, I am general counsel to a logistics, transportation and energy business and represent clients in a variety of commercial matters including commercial disputes and litigation, antitrust and competition issues, business structure and entity formation, asset purchases and sales, and real estate transactions.\n\nNicole Rash: I am in the process of taking the bar exam and will be transitioning my internship to a full-time attorney position at Gleam Law. I focus on cannabis trademark law and business issues. In my free time, you\u2019ll catch me playing forward on a men\u2019s hockey team.",

Although I think some of them missed the memo because they run solo practices (very, very, very poorly) and will have a meltdown over the slightest inconvenience. Turns out running your business with such tight overhead that a minor obstacle brings the whole thing crashing down is a bad idea. Who would have thought!\n\n\nOne of my clients put it well, though: everyone in law school was the smartest kid in their hometown class (or above average), but all of those people go to law school and find out they're subpar in comparison to the competition. So, you wind up seeing a lot of dumb, fragile ego'd people who lack the business practicality and common sense for running a practice, let alone being a good attorney, but they're all egotistical to some degree and many have control issues. \n\n\nThat being said, business sense isn't everyone's forte and I have great clients who recognize they're better attorneys than businessmen, but they're capable of letting people who are more specialized in the business side of things actually run that part of the machine as a team, and thus, they have very successful firms. Hoenstly I think some business education needs to be a requirement for law school. It's insane how many people are drowning in horribly managed overhead. \n\n\n\nWhats really fascinating to me is how wildly different this tends to be with each state, though. Every state tends to have a certain kind of attorney personality as it's most prevalent sort of character, and some states are fantastic, while others I won't even touch with a 100 mile pole. The absolute worst state by FAR is Texas. You couldn't pay me a million dollars an hour to touch Texas again. People are unbelievable, easily the most entitled, egotistical, idiotic bunch of lawyers in the country. It's like half of them are licking lead paint and huffing paint thinner.Granted that's not to say there aren't gems. Some of my favourite clients of all time are out of Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio. Just have to wade through a bog of absolute insanity to find them. \ud83d\ude44\n\n\nHonestly idk how tf you guys can stand being attorneys. I've had a couple clients tell me I should have been one and I just laughed and was like nah, then I'd have to deal with these assholes even more, in person at that. He laughed and said that was a good point.\n\nIt's been an interesting experience to say the least. I've learned a lot, had some crazy cool clients, and heard some craaaaazy stories.",

It's easy to remember: trademarks protect a mark used in trade. Parody in trademark law is far more narrow than copyright parody as commercial speech is afforded far less protections. And parody in trademarks is rather confusing, but one major area that is universal is parody is rarely found in trademark law when related to vice. \n\n  \n\nWeirdest?

However, unlike cannabis, the production of psilocybin takes so little space and labor that there will not be an industry behind it. There will probably be a medical industry and a brick and mortar industry for microdosing and stacks. This is more of a major cultural shift than it is an money-making industry. Because of this, we are very involved for the societal benefits, but we do not anticipate a major uptick in business as a result.",

Nope. \n\nI think what does differ is that sometimes the knowledge we use in our cases can get into the esoterica of rules that only apply in our industry, both the written regulations and the regulations in practice. It also means, to effectively do my job, I have to have a very boots on the ground knowledge regarding my client's business, in order to tell their story effectively.

However I would direct you to the following from the PA State Police website:\n\nPer the United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE), the possession of medical marijuana remains a violation of federal law, and possession of a valid Medical Marijuana Card and/or the use of medical marijuana makes you an \u201cunlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance\u201d who is prohibited by federal law from the purchase or acquisition, possession, or control of a firearm pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(3), and 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.32(a)(3).  \nThe BATFE\u2019s position is set forth in its September 21, 2011, Open Letter to all Federal Firearms Licensees, which states in part that \u201c\\[t\\]herefore, any person who uses or is addicted to marijuana, regardless of whether his or her State has passed legislation authorizing marijuana use for medicinal purposes, is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance, and is prohibited by Federal law from possessing }rearms or ammunition.\u201d Click here for a copy of the Open Letter. (https://www.atf.gov/}le/60211/download)  Likewise, the mere possession of a Medical Marijuana Card will give rise to an inference that you are an \u201cunlawful user of or addicted to\u201d a controlled substance, pursuant to 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.11.",

    "postText": "Hey Reddit! I'm thrilled to be here today to participate in this Ask Me Anything (AMA) session. I want to shed light on a dark truth that compelled me to make a difficult decision and part ways with the prestigious Jim Henson Company. As a puppeteer who worked behind the scenes, I became aware of unethical practices involving the use of animal body parts to decorate puppets. Today, I'm here to share my story, answer your questions, and expose the truth behind these disturbing practices.\n\nAs a puppeteer, I had the opportunity to work closely with the puppets, and after noticing how many were decorated with real feathers, I researched how commercial feathers were obtained.  It was shocking. Animal abuse is employed to obtain these feathers. I couldn't stay silent after witnessing the cruelty inflicted upon innocent creatures for the sake of artistic embellishment. I made the difficult choice to leave the company in protest, hoping to raise awareness about these practices and spark a change in the industry.\n\nLet's get this conversation started! AMA!\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/0fkLe2T)!\n\nEDIT: OK everyone- I'm calling it. Thank you to all that came with earnest questions.",

A puppet doesn't exist, and then someone gathers materials and puts them together in a specific way and voila! We have a puppet.  In order to make an ethical puppet, just make sure you are using ethical materials.  Materials that necessitate or promote abuse and murder of others are not ethical materials.",

Like think of the average person's reaction if you said you were raising money for a cause about animal cruelty, and they ask you \"oh good, I love animals. Is this for panda bears, or saving habitats for deer and elk and stuff? Or to stop people from killing sharks?\" And then you have to respond \"oh, no, we're trying to save a couple of dozen ostriches from being plucked to make a handful of puppets.\" It's like saying you're fighting climate change, but instead of promoting alternative energy or expanding mass transit, you want people named Steve who drive green Volvos to stop driving them on Tuesdays when there's a full moon.

They're watching a show with their kids, not trying to hone a political stance on animal cruelty. There's a time and place for it and it's not while your child is learning shapes and colours.\n\nI'd be overjoyed if they found an alternative material to make the costume. But it doesn't make a difference to anyone watching the show. If you want to educate kids (or parents for that matter) about animal cruelty, there are far, far more effective arenas to have that conversation. Because right now, it just looks like you're trying to call people out and make them feel bad about enjoying a beloved children's show that has been basically nothing but a positive influence in the lives of millions of people.

People today don\u2019t care because they have been used to seeing animals used as props, as meat, as decoration, and as entertainment. But if we stopped using animals as we please, the next generation would be totally against it. \n\nBecause logically, no human being likes and wants to kill and hurt animals. If you ask anyone, they\u2019ll tell you that they love them and don\u2019t want to hurt them. \n\nBut because since they were babies they were told that it\u2019s not okay to hurt a dog but okay to hurt a pig, that\u2019s what they do. \n\nMost people today don\u2019t even realize that they have been taught it was normal to kill an animal for food and never question it for real. Some religions for example forbid to eat some animals and all the people in that religion follow the rule. But take another religion and then it\u2019s another animal you can\u2019t eat. It\u2019s not logical or based on science, it\u2019s just based on \u00ab\u00a0everybody is doing that, so I do it\u00a0\u00bb.\n\nSo if we make a real change to NOT use animals as decorations, entertainment, clothes or food and we do it for 10 years, a whole generation of people will become used to that and then if someone does it again, they\u2019ll be upset with them and think it\u2019s monstrous.

Aren't you outraged he has to live in the shittiest place in the Street? What is this teaching kids about social class? Why do some of the characters get real homes? None of them have jobs it would seem, who's paying for all this stuff? Kids are gonna grow up thinking nothing costs money!

This is an absolute case study on why people that would otherwise help you, don't. Its why shit like Greenpeace and PETA don't get more support.

You *are* fine with animal abuse, because you literally pay for it to happen.  If you are really against animal abuse you can stop paying for it, and then you won't be an animal abuser any more.  \n\nThe thing is, there are a LOT of vegans out there doing activism in many different ways.  Some share recipes, some advocate for cows, or pigs, or sheep, some do street activism where they show videos, some people push for legislation, etc... there are SO many people employing SO many different approaches.  It's disingenuous of you to say that this is exactly why people who would otherwise help me don't.  There are SO many people working on this issue, using many different tactics and styles- if you really want to get on board go find someone who has a style that resonates with you, or hell- just go for it on your own.  It's absolutely childish of you to imply that the behavior of activists should have any bearing on whether or not you support a rights issue.  Would you feel the same way if anti human slavery people were doing activism you didn't agree with?  Or would you be against human slavery no matter how they acted?\n\nYou mention caring about the humans making the boas-- are you aware that it is possible to care about more than one issue at a time?

We need to remember that raising a bird in an agricultural context has a huge environmental impact for the lifespan of that bird, and also puts everyone at risk of bird flu and antibiotic resistance.  Molted feathers and feathers from old birds who have died naturally are generally not of a high-enough quality and consistency to be used in a commercial context.  Sesame Street is very particular and exacting about the quality of feather used on Big Bird, for example.\n\nAlso, when we use feathers to decorate a puppet, even if those feathers were obtained in the most ethical way possible with no harm to any birds, simply by USING those feathers we are promoting feathers as an appropriate material to be used as decorations and that is bad for all the other birds who are being abused for their feathers.  For all those reasons it is best to not use real feathers if one wants to avoid participating in and promoting animal abuse.",

I remember figuring out the melody to the [Van Der Valk theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV8t3jA-krc) when I was about 6 or 7. I played violin for a little while in school where they taught us to pluck twinkle twinkle little star, then for some reason threw us into the orchestra like we knew what we were doing and knew sheet music! I remember bluffing it the whole way, terrified, hoping noone would notice but one girl was not pleased and spoke to the teacher, and thus my violin career ended.\n\nI eventually picked up a guitar at the age of 14. I wanted to be Brian May. Punk was the prevalent culture too and I couldn't skate, so I figured I could contribute in some other way. My parents got me a 30 quid nylon accoustic to see if I'd stick with it. It wasn't a phase, so I ended up getting a Vintage Strat copy soon after!\n\nFavourite bands from the early 2000s: Not sure about bands that started in the 2000s, unless you wanna hear about my little midwest emo side. I really like Elliott- False Cathedrals, Jimmy Eat World, and really liked stuff like The Appleseed Cast and early Mew. Honestly, probably tons of other stuff but nothing's coming to my mind straight away.",

The 3 you've heard already started as rough ideas from Dave, and I just kinda went \"nah its too busy, put that riff back in the box\" or \"this would work good here\" and sent \"cool riff.wav\" until we had a song. I really have the most fun job here. It's basically spitball tasty riffs, shred a solo, and criticize. \"Rhythm guitar\" is a much less glamourous credit but Dave's really been the beating heart of the band so far.\n\nFor unreleased ones, we have some I'm arranging, some where I just laid down a solo (that first song I mentioned is still gonna be on the album) and some we haven't written yet! I'm stoked to see what Mardy adds creatively too, since we already had these songs written when he joined.",

We've got a couple of 8 minute epics in the works, and they're frankly, colossal sounding. Lyle's cooking one of them and it is a BEAST! We're still working on some of the ideas I've brought to the band alongside some that Lyle's bringing in, as well as a few that we're growing more organically as a collaboration. The latter is the goal with most of our stuff eventually. I think you'll def be able to go \"oh, that's a Dave or a Lyle or a Mardy song\" immediately.\n\nFor me, a lot of band's output sounds exactly the same and it's hard to tell where you're at in an album, particularly with more extreme music. There's SO MUCH to learn from pop here. One of my favourite pop bands is The 1975, and the great thing about them alongside acts such as Queen is you know which song you're listening to within 1-2 seconds of it starting. That's our goal. You instantly go \"oh it's that one!\"",

I still would take absolute silence over music I dislike, I don't know if that's normal.\n\nI'd occasionally hear little snippets of cool guitar stuff, like fuckin diddy kong ripping a solo when he'd beat a level in Donkey Kong Country 2 and I'd be like, \"THAT I WANT THAT\" and then I'd ask my parent's about rock and roll and they'd be put on Cat Stevens or something like that and I'd go \"nahh that's not it\" (moon shadow kinda lowkey fucks though.) \n\nSo when I finally discovered rock and metal I got fucking OBSESSED with it. I think the first two albums I owned were AC/DC's Back in Black, and Metallica's \"And Justice For All,\" from there it opened up into like Slayer, Megadeth, In Flames, Children of Bodom, Judas Priest etc. and it was just kind of a \"I want to do that.\"  \n\n\nAs for the other stuff, started making videos to make my friends laugh and then had one of my really early things go viral and it sorta happened right as I was at the age where I had to figure out what I wanted to do as a career so it just sorta fell into my lap.\n\nI've known Chris and Zach and Cory since like the oldschool newgrounds days!",

I'd kind of recommend different stuff to everyone.\n\nIt's tempting to recommend the classics, oldschool Metallica, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest.\n\nI actually like to show people melodic death metal, like Children of Bodom or Dethklok. Because it makes you feel like you're in the deep end of the pool and helps you wrap your head around \"oh the vocals are supposed to be a drum, not a piano.\"\n\nPower metal is also very listenable to newcomers I think. Spin some Beast in Black or Avantasia!",

Like any great album, each song stands on their own (apart from Don't Tread On Me \\*shudder\\*) and it's got enough hooks to entertain a more casual listener who wants to dabble into heavy sounds. I also recommend S&amp;M by the same band. Hugely melodic and beautiful. The orchestra is a good crutch for the ear if you don't think you can enjoy the metal by itself just yet. \n\nI also think Anthrax- Among The Living is an insanely fun album. The riffs are heavy but the lyrical fare is lighter, and they're a great party band. They've eventually become my fav 'big four' band but that could just be exhaustion from the other bands.\n\nEdit: Oh, and of course, PAINKILLER!\n\nOnce you've got a feeling for it check out Pantera- Cowboys From Hell, Death- Symbolic, Exodus- Tempo Of The Damned. There's a good starting point and you don't have to like everything all at once. Find one you like and spin that shit until you start expanding to the songs before and after it. That's how I find my footing with new music.",

Dude said yes! \n\nOnce we started collaborating Lyle started suggesting good structural changes for the songs already there, and bringing in riffs that worked better in some areas. So it kinda became more of a proper collaboration thing in terms of writing and we decided to change the name to something new. We've been sitting on some of this stuff for a year as we've had a hard time finding a vocalist that was passionate about what we do. We talked to the brilliant David Benites for a while, and he was all in until his career really took off, so he couldn't work in the timeframe we wanted anymore. He recommended Mardy Leith, who is an absolutely sick Australian singer. He's right in our goldilocks zone of \"get him now before Journey ask him to come sing with them or something\", so we're very lucky. Dude's an absolute sweetheart. And here we are now, writing songs for you guys and striving to get better! Petrified Giant! \\*does horns\\*",

The band's name changed to A Red Letter Day (after the Get Up Kids song) and we started playing sweater emo.\n\nI dunno if this counts but when I loved to the US I started a truly awful band called [Hey Banana Na!1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7_6D-lkewo) where we'd write songs in 2 mins and perform live at the Cyanide &amp; Happiness Banana Bar Crawls. Check out the link if you wanna listen to some nauseating stuff. We got told to stop playing music by a manager ne time in a bar on McKinney Ave (Dallas).\n\nThese days my main musical project is Petrified Giant, and I've also got a fun Sunday side project called Die Wurst where I play silly fun songs with some good boys. We occasionally do shows in the DFW area! Keep an eye out.",

Spoilers Ahead is the exact same process but its way more time consuming and expensive, and also I have to kinda stare into it for months, and then when it comes out people are like \"erm, why are you making a video about a movie that came out 9 months ago instead of something that came out last week.\" Also Spoilers Ahead is more of a tightrope walk for me personally because I generally am not a fan of online critic/thinkpiece-y content so I'm hypercritical of making sure its abundantly clear that the goal is to wring something for goofs rather than offer abject criticism. Most episodes of spoilers ahead I scrap just as much content as what ends up in the video.",

Very excited to hear more and maybe even see you play live one day.",

Love to wander all over the place with our sound, we like to play with synths too to give it that sorta Fear-Factory \"slab of metal meets wires and electrical components\" kinda vibe. There's also a slight synthwave component so things like Vangelis's Blade Runner soundtrack are the sort of thing I like to pepper songs with.",

We think it reps the music quite well.\n\nAs for lyrics, sure! You can find the lyrics to [Flesh Born OF Flesh here.](https://www.boomplay.com/lyrics/122872206) Flesh Born Of Flesh deals with my response to my mother's cancer diagnosis. She was always quite blaze and \"take it as it comes\" in life, and I was worried that she was too tired to fight. The \"Headless Carriage at the door\" is from an old Irish myth that says old Irish families have banshees appear above their house the night before a death, and then death himself comes on a carriage to take you. My lyrics are about her being too tired to fight death. Unfortunately, she lost that battle and this is one of the songs that deals with that. The lyrics were written before she passed away, so it's an interesting and saddening perspective to look back on now.\n\nTraitorous is a song about those who put their own grandstanding above the needs of others. It is about those with selfish and narcissistic principles- people who would rather remain 'morally pure' in their minds than actually help people suffering if it required them to shake on their principles.\n\nGodless Sky is about those who are ill and refuse treatment, believing a higher power will take them only to discover that there is nothing.",

Not only do the two genres work amazingly together but the band was so dang good. Never thought I'd find an album outside of my usual spot, the progmetal sub\n\nI'm excited to listen to your guys' album next, I have it queued up for my drive to work later. I used to read C&amp;H a bunch and I watched Oney back in the day as well so I'm (now) semi-familiar with all three members. How did you guys meet?",

Loved the thrash and groove influences, the vocals were awesome, as I expected after dragoncorpse, and I really dug the thrashy guitar solos. Who tracked the drums?

A lot of people tell you that you need to know a ton about mastering, but that's kinda bullshit. You can find a good mastering preset in Ableton and apply that to your master track and voila. I tend to work backwards where I'll apply a mastering preset first so I know what the music's going to sound like as I write it. From there it's finding your favourite tones and learning how to amplify, eq and compress them to your liking. I find the bigger and louder the better, as long as it doesn't cut and you can hear everything!",

From there it moved onto other Queen tunes, to stuff like Green Day, and then onwards to Metallica etc and it grew from there. The first thing that taught me how to solo was Pearl Jam's cover of Leaving Here). There's a little pentatonic doodle in the middle that taught me the scale, and I just started experimenting with it after that. I love playing the blues and I can shred in my own way but Lyle's the technical dude when it comes to solos.",

I said yes and by the time i got back from school you already accepted and basically said \"when?\"\n\nYou had a great show that night with Colin Firth, i then went backstage said hi to ppl i noticed from TV like Jordan Schlansky who acted like he should know who i was or \"why is this kid saying hi to me\" you brought me to your dressing room showed me a custom cartoon face guitar made for you and spent a while with me and my family.\n\nYou probably dont remember us but just wanted to take a chance that you read this and say Thank You again for everything you did for my health and my recovery.\n\n",

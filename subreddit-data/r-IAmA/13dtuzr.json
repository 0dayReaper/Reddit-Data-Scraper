Let's have a conversation!**\n\nWe first founded Psychedelic Passage in 2019. Our service bridges the gap between journeyer and facilitator by ensuring that clients have a convenient point of access to pre-qualified facilitators near them. \n\nWe\u2019ve essentially tried to take the guesswork out of psychedelic journeying by establishing minimum service standards for a comprehensive in-person ceremonial support program.\n\nTo date, our network of guides has facilitated over 750+ ceremonial journeys. The one caveat to our services is that facilitators don\u2019t provide the medicine, we rely on journeyers to source their own. \n\nWe\u2019d like to open the floor to a true two-way conversation about anything you\u2019d like. We want everyone\u2019s voice to have a say in the narrative that surrounds psychedelic healing in the U.S. \n\n**If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about psychedelic healing, about our services, or about the industry as a whole, we\u2019re open to sharing our stance and our knowledge with complete transparency.**\n\nWe cannot provide medical advice, but we, along with our head of content\u2013Erika Perez, will ensure that all of our responses are informed by everything we know to be true.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to chat with you all!\n\n***Please express your consent if you consent to your comment being anonymously included in a Q&amp;A article**.\n \nOur AMA is now closed. Thank you to everyone who shared their questions. We\u2019re excited to do this again in the future! Until then, keep asking questions, continue advocating for ethical standards, and require transparency from all stakeholders in this industry. \n\nWe\u2019ve written an article that addresses all of your comments in more depth.

I think the first step here is to determine how you want to serve in this capacity. What I mean by that is that there are different tracks to accessing psychedelic care: the clinical model, international retreats, state sanctioned models, underground facilitation, etc. \n\nEach of those tracks has different training and education requirements to become a facilitator.

                    "comment": "Our network of guides has experience working with all types of psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca, and DMT. Most often, clients choose to work with psilocybin. This is a typical preference because mushrooms tend to be much more easily accessible. Clients are also more inclined to work with psilocybin because it's a natural product, meaning there's very little risk of adulteration. That, coupled with more mainstream media attention onto psilocybin, is why clients most frequently work with mushrooms. \n\nWe wouldn't say there's a top pick in terms of a drug that'll elicit the \"best\" experience. We think that all psychedelics can contribute something unique to our human experience and that your choice should depend on your specific intentions for healing and past experiences with psychedelics. \n\nGenerally though, because of the predictability around determining dosage and length of peak experience, psilocybin mushrooms tend to be the most 'beginner friendly' and the easiest to assess potential medical contraindications with. If you'd like more info, check out our guide on How to Choose The Right Psychedelic Substance: https://www.psychedelicpassage.com/a-guide-on-how-to-choose-the-right-psychedelic-substance/\n\nWe also recorded a podcast with Dr. Giordano that explores the nuances of how to choose the right psychedelic substance for you: https://open.spotify.com/episode/2yF9C8aSRkeB5N8ut2IoWz?si=f83d475089d84f87",

It's worth noting that the local stores, churches and delivery services tend to be located in decriminalized areas like DC, Ann Arbor, and Oakland. More of these online and local vendors are popping up daily, and a quick Google search may help you identify your sourcing options. It's also worth noting that states like Colorado are passing legislation that includes communal gifting of psychedelic medicine, which will also increase accessibility. \n\nThough we can't help with sourcing directly, an important part of harm reduction is making sure that the substance you have is the substance you think it is. That's why we suggest testing medicine using something like Qtests (https://qtests.org/ref/3/) to verify the amount of psilocybin the mushroom contains or a reagent kit for testing synthetic medicines. Additionally, we provide clients with harm reduction resources on how to source safely via a Sourcing Guide we sent to those who book a consultation call with our Concierge Team.",

In fact, many clients of ours have access to medicine, but don\u2019t feel comfortable taking it without guidance. \n\nMost clients seeking services like ours are desiring to work through personal, mental and emotional issues that have been suppressed for a long time (i.e. anxiety, depression, PTSD, addiction, etc.). The idea of releasing and confronting these parts of ourselves can be very intimidating, and often too uncomfortable to bear without external, professional support. Plus the logistics behind how to actually go about using psychedelics to heal and overcome these diagnoses are very unclear to most clients. \n\nOur network of pre-vetted guides take clients through preparation and integration, as well as the in-person ceremony. Not only are they helping clients manage expectations, get clear on personal intentions, and determine logistics like dosage, setting, and other medication management, but they\u2019re also helping clients hold themselves accountable for keeping up with their healing intentions, even after the actual psychedelic journey has concluded. We have an article that details the full psychedelic therapy process (https://www.psychedelicpassage.com/the-psychedelic-therapy-process-a-step-by-step-guide/) which, as you might note, is far more involved than simply consuming a psychedelic substance.  \n\nIf you read our testimonials you\u2019ll see that most people seeking to engage with these substances frankly have no idea what they\u2019re doing without extensive guidance and support. \n\nWe also have a podcast episode and transcript that discusses the role of a psychedelic guide in more depth: https://www.psychedelicpassage.com/what-is-the-role-of-a-facilitator/",

My question is this... for those naive to the experience and want to use it for personal betterment, is it a process one can get familiar with and use on their own in the future? If I pay for a guided (not inexpensive) experience, will the knowledge and experience gained facilitate using the medicine without a paid guide in the future? Thanks for the AMA",

However, I want to be clear this is going to be person and situation specific. Someone with a large amount of unresolved trauma for instance, likely wouldn\u2019t want to do a high dose journey on their own even once they understand the process as there is a high potential for disorientation, discomfort and destabilization. Alternatively, if you already consider yourself to be well and looking for personal betterment, there\u2019s a much higher likelihood that you could learn the ropes with a guide and then take those tools and begin implementing them on your own in self-guided journeys. We provide preparation and integration materials (PDF\u2019s and video workshops) to help arm clients with the appropriate tools and frameworks to use when navigating altered states of consciousness. At the end of the day, it\u2019s about ensuring you have the support you need to feel comfortable taking a plunge into the unknown. We\u2019ve seen some clients explore on their own after their first ceremony and others come back to continue work with their facilitator.",

                    "comment": "You are absolutely right that practitioner abuse is a serious issue and, unfortunately, every line of service has a shadow side--even psychedelics. We even hear stories of therapists and psychiatrists engaging in sexual relationships with their clients or otherwise behaving unethically. One part of the issue is that psychedelic-related services have been unregulated for many decades, primarily offered through illegal \"underground\" services. There was also no regulating body to monitor facilitator practices. \n\nDue to the potential legal risk of psychedelics, privacy was at the highest priority in the underground landscape; sometimes more so than the values of transparent practices or systems of advocacy for abused individuals. In the past, this not only made it extremely difficult for individuals to report instances of facilitator abuse in an effective way, but also made it difficult to identify abusers and bad actors in the space. What's crazy is that you hear about this type of abuse being perpetrated even in the MAPS trials. \n\nHopefully as psychedelic-related services become more mainstream and available, there will be commonly agreed upon ethics and standards of practice (a code of conduct) as well as more transparent systems of advocacy and support which will hopefully not only minimize instances of abuse, but weed out bad service providers. Even as state licensure becomes available in legal markets like Oregon and Colorado, the training requirements are minimal and lack any sort of a human component. Meaning the state's regulating bodies aren't screening potential facilitators for psychological issues, alignment of morals, or even a basic check of human reasonableness like an interview. \n\nAnother big factor here is the power dynamics at play. Often the clients seeking this type of work are suffering from mental/emotional illness meaning they are already in a vulnerable place and then you add in a psychedelic medicine that further increases vulnerability. That coupled with a facilitator who's \"holier than thou\" creates an environment that is ripe for facilitator abuse. This is why it's so important to vet your facilitator before engaging them for services. We actually recorded a podcast episode on this topic that you may find interesting: https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ABv0KF8k6lMTpicCip5ro?si=tZEyWda7Rbu9x5bLVNWhYw \n\nInterestingly enough, this is one of the reasons why our facilitator network is structured like it is so that PP serves as an independent body that can moderate the network of facilitators who all have their own private practice. So in addition to vetting facilitators to gain admittance into the network, we're also tracking their performance in real time to ensure that our internal code of conduct and ethical standards are being upheld. Although we can't guarantee outcomes, we can ensure that any facilitator that fails to uphold those standards will be dropped from the network.",

I fell in love with not only the process of growing but was really in awe of the immense power these mushrooms have. Seeing that more and more states are green lighting psychedelic mushrooms for legal use I would love to switch careers into this field. Where could I start with finding work? I'm in NJ on the border of Philadelphia and as far as I know neither have opened the law yet to mushrooms but they've both legalized cannabis so it's only a matter of time. I'd be interested in either growing OR the psych side. I have a behavioral health degree if that does anything.",

There\u2019s no shortage of ways to get involved, it\u2019s more about determining which ones meet your needs, skillset, and risk tolerance when it comes to a career. \n\nThere are a few potential avenues you could explore to find work in the industry. One option is to look for job openings at companies that are already established in the field, such as psychedelic therapy clinics, research institutions, or companies focused on developing and selling products related to psilocybin. \n\nYou could also consider starting your own business, whether it's focused on growing mushrooms, creating products, or providing services related to the psychedelic experience. Another option is to look for opportunities to get involved with advocacy and education efforts related to psychedelics, which could potentially lead to connections and job opportunities in the industry. \n\nYou touched on this, but it\u2019s worth noting that the opportunities do vary based on geographical location. We\u2019re certainly going to see more ways to get involved in states like Oregon and Colorado where legal, state-sanctioned treatment programs are coming online. \n\nAdditionally, you may consider pursuing further education or training in the field, such as through a certificate program or apprenticeship. Networking on Linked in is also a great way to get in touch with people in the industry who you may not otherwise connect with!",

Our main mission is to connect psychedelic-interested individuals to a pre-vetted network of service providers. We feel it\u2019s ethically best that training programs operate separately from organizations like ours. We do our own independent vetting of those in our facilitator network, which include a review of any education, certifications, training programs, or apprenticeships completed. Likely, in the near future, some of those service providers in our network will have a facilitator license with the Oregon Psilocybin Services, meaning they\u2019ve gone through a program with one of the state-approved training providers.\n\nIn any case, we acknowledge that the training, skillset, and expertise of licensed providers will vary, and always encourage people to do their research on their facilitator or guide, regardless of licensure.\n\nBlog article on the topic: [https://www.psychedelicpassage.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-psychedelic-guide-or-trip-sitter/](https://www.psychedelicpassage.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-psychedelic-guide-or-trip-sitter/)\n\nPodcast episode on choosing the right facilitator: [https://open.spotify.com/episode/1lXavFKWBByDRDeD47pzoC?si=5492ecee6f7c4034](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1lXavFKWBByDRDeD47pzoC?si=5492ecee6f7c4034)\n\nPodcast episode w/ our thoughts on what\u2019s going on in Oregon: [https://open.spotify.com/episode/2VJRAA5b0dPMP0OGeTu8bq?si=704dbd7a71d84c2c](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2VJRAA5b0dPMP0OGeTu8bq?si=704dbd7a71d84c2c)\n\nAs far as your second question, as a part of harm reduction we always recommend testing your substances if you\u2019re unsure, both for potency and adulteration. We mention it in another response, but luckily there are products like Qtests ([https://qtests.org/ref/3/](https://qtests.org/ref/3/)) to verify the potency of the psychedelic or reagent test kits, like from Dancesafe ([https://dancesafe.org/shop/r/PsychPassage/](https://dancesafe.org/shop/r/PsychPassage/)) for ruling out adulterations, including separate fentanyl test kits. Having this extra measure can give you peace of mind so you can focus on your intentions and navigate your psychedelic experience in a meaningful way.",

From our perspective, it\u2019s important to separate out a \u201cbad trip\u201d from an adverse experience. A bad trip is typically defined as a challenging or difficult experience while being under the influence of a hallucinatory substance such as psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, ayahuasca, or even cannabis. Alternatively, an adverse experience is a truly traumatic event while under the influence of psychedelics i.e. facilitator abuse, neglect, sexual assault, violence, etc. As you can see, there is a clear distinction between the two.  \nThat said, challenging or uncomfortable psychedelic experiences are often an integral part of the healing process. It\u2019s safe to assume that any repressed or suppressed thoughts, emotions, or trauma can resurface during a therapeutic session. Hence the saying, \u201cthe only way to heal it is to feel it.\u201d Which we find to be especially true in these settings.    \nThe best way to mitigate the chances of a bad trip is to adequately prepare for the upcoming psychedelic experience. That starts by reframing what a bad trip is: \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d are arbitrary labels we assign to our experiences. And generally, people use \u201cbad\u201d to describe discomfort or pain.  \nFrom there, we arm the journeyer with a series of tools, techniques, and frameworks to use when navigating altered states of consciousness. So if they do find themselves at a challenging inflection point during the journey, they have the resources to help themselves work through it. Obviously the facilitator is there to help as well. We\u2019ll link two podcast episodes below that address this in more detail.   \nI\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201csweets\u201d with regards to ending a trip so I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t weigh in there.  \nPodcast mitigating bad trip episode 1 and 2:  \n[https://www.psychedelicpassage.com/mitigating-the-chances-of-a-bad-trip-part-1/](https://www.psychedelicpassage.com/mitigating-the-chances-of-a-bad-trip-part-1/)   \n[https://www.psychedelicpassage.com/mitigating-the-chances-of-a-bad-trip-part-2/](https://www.psychedelicpassage.com/mitigating-the-chances-of-a-bad-trip-part-2/)",

We answered a question above on how our clients actually go about sourcing psychedelic medicine. Our advice for most clients is to start with psilocybin because it is relatively safe, predictable, effective, and has very few medical contraindications (more on this in one of our other answers in this thread as well). \n\nIn order to become a part of our facilitator network, facilitators must:\n\nMust complete a facilitator training program or apprenticeship\nMust pass a criminal background check\nMust have personal experience journeying with psychedelics themselves\nMust complete a series of interviews to screen out potential psychological issues\nMust have 2+ years professional experience or a minimum of 20+ ceremonies facilitated\nMust be actively engaged in their own healing process (i.e. therapy, coaching, etc.)\nMust complete an application to verify their standard operating procedures\nMust submit two letters of recommendation from professional colleagues\nMust submit two client references that we independently verify\nMust commit to the North Star Ethical Pledge\nMust commit to being independently reviewed by clients to ensure standards are upheld\nMust agree to leave the network if service standards aren't upheld\n\nI hope that simultaneously answers your question about what their qualifications are. In general, the network consists of professional facilitators with a variety of backgrounds such as:\n\nPhDs in Psychology\nPsychotherapists\nRetreat facilitators\nRehabilitation counselors\nDoctors of Acupuncture\nCertified psychospiritual coaches\n\nAt this point, law enforcement isn\u2019t concerned with what we\u2019re doing because we aren't breaking any laws. We don\u2019t provide or touch any controlled substances and all of the facilitators in the network are partaking in legal harm reduction services. Truthfully, I think they have bigger fish to fry considering the amount of people openly selling drugs online at the moment. \n\nAll potential clients who want to engage with services must undergo an extensive screening &amp; intake process to ensure that they are fit for a psychedelic experience and good fit for the facilitator. Ultimately, we have no way to prove for certain that it\u2019s not a NARC but I think most facilitators get an intuitive hit when things feel off during the screening process. \n\nWith regards to cost, all of our facilitators operate on a tiered pricing structure with the intention of making psychedelic services available to people across all different backgrounds and socioeconomic levels. It\u2019s also worth noting that financial assistance is available to those that qualify. You can learn more about our pricing model here: https://www.psychedelicpassage.com/our-services/",

Although I acknowledge that there are multiple ways to interpret what\u2019s happening while under the influence of a psychedelic substance. For me, I\u2019ve found the spiritual framework to be especially helpful when integrating altered states of consciousness. However, as you might imagine, not all clients are open to that way of thinking, and so facilitators often tailor the frameworks and word choice they use based on the clients. \n\nWith regards to a bad trip, I wrote out a very detailed reply to this in the AMA thread already and for the sake of time, I\u2019m going to point you there.\n\nI can\u2019t say for sure what causes people to get stuck in loops but I will say that it\u2019s very common when under the influence of a psychedelic. I view it as a natural form of processing, even if it\u2019s not conscious. Therefore, I usually encourage clients to complete their process\u2013even if it\u2019s centered around a particular loop. As facilitators, we\u2019re there to hold space for whatever is happening, not to control it. \n\nSome grounding techniques that I really like are:\n\nHolding a physical object (i.e. a stone, stick, hand, etc.)\nConscious and intentional breaths \nChanging or removing audio inputs \nChanging environment \nUsing a weighted blanket \nTaking a drink of water\nEating nourishing food\nMovement (moving out of the head and into the body)\nSmelling essential oils",

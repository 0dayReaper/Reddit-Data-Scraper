    "postText": "My name is Ivan Kutskir, I am 28 y.o. and live in Prague, the Czech Republic. I am the author of [Photopea photo editor](https://www.Photopea.com) , an advanced image editor, that works in a web browser. There were about 3 million visitors in June.\n\nI already [did the AMA here seven months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9urjmg/i_made_a_free_alternative_to_photoshop_that_is/) with an amazing response! I would like to let you know, what happened since then, and how much has Reddit helped me :)\n\n* the number of users doubled\n* my income quadrupled (I replaced AdSense with other ad providers)\n* I added the support for new RAW formats, Actions, Slices, Templates and many other features\n* Photopea is fully translated into 38 languages (by users)\n* I got in touch (videocalls) with Corel, Adobe, Google and many other tech companies (mostly from the Silicon Valley)\n* I gave [a talk about Photopea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZmaeC_Ma5A) at the Web2Day conference in France\n\nI still work on Photopea alone from the same apartment in Prague, on the same $500 laptop :) I was never so excited about the progress of Photopea. Ask me Anything! :)\n\nYou can follow Photopea on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photopea) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photopeacom) :)     Proof: I put a link to this AMA [here](https://www.photopea.com/reddit.html)!",

There is a Vectorize Image (bitmap tracing) feature and several other features, that are not present in Photoshop. Also, Photopea runs on Linux, Chrome OS, Android, iOS and anywhere else, where you have a browser :)\n\nUnlike GIMP, Photopea fully supports the PSD format. So it has features such as layer styles, adjustment layers, smart objects, smart filters, text warping etc.",

I'm gonna have to give this a try, sounds amazing...\n\nThanks for doing this AMA, I'd not have heard of this otherwise",

Seems like it would be easier to integrate in to people's workflows, with the ability to open files with photopea, and ability to use offline.\n\nCan you support yourself with the ad revenue?\n\nDo you have other similar projects planned?\n\nThanks! The .psd file support is amazing. And amazing it is better than the work of all the people at GIMP. You're amazing!",

Examples of bad acquisitions -  \n  \nReddit founders originally sold the company to Conde Nast for $1M each. That was obviously a bad deal for them but at the same time they were in their early 20's with no idea Reddit would continue to grow and reach the numbers the site has now.   \n    \nKevin Rose turned down Google when they tried to acquire Digg for $200M. Just four years later he eventually sold the company for $500K (split with other stakeholders). He should have sold to Google.    \n  \nAnd the mother of all insane acquisitions to me is selling Oculus to Facebook for $2B. To put that in perspective, Twitch was sold to Amazon for half that. That was a very good deal for Palmer Luckey since VR adoption started slowing after he sold. Long term maybe it ends up being worth it but they have a lot of deep pocket competitors and it's still early days for the industry.",

Later, I had to learn about advanced algorithms, to add some advanced features. But my CS degree definitely helped me understand all the terminology, so it was not very hard.\n\nI also had to learn about many standards, such as PSD, PDF, PostScript, PNG, TIFF, OpenType ... It has nothing to do with science, you just have to go through hundreds of pages of specifications, to be able to implement that standard. And you return to these specifications from time to time, to fix problems in your implementation :)",

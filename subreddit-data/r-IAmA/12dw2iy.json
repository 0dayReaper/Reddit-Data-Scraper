    "postText": "Hi reddit, I\u2019m David Erick Ramos, a professional ocarinist, composer, and content creator. I\u2019ve been playing the ocarina for 23 years and sharing my original ocarina music and tutorials online since 2007, where I've built a community of 277K subscribers on Youtube and 136k followers on Tiktok. You may have seen me perform at gaming events like PAX or live in concert as a featured soloist with \"Video Games Live\" or Nintendo's \"Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the Goddesses\" (which was a dream come true btw).\n\nI've been fascinated with ocarinas ever since discovering them through \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" back in 1998, and my obsession with learning more about their history and development has taken me across the world, amassing one of the largest ocarina collections in the United States.\n\nMy latest project is creating a virtual ocarina museum with my collection. This will be an online interactive experience that showcases the history, culture, and diversity of 400+ ocarinas from around the world, some hundreds of years old. You\u2019ll be able to explore different exhibits, learn about different types of ocarinas, listen to samples of each piece, watch videos, and learn how the ocarina went from Mesoamerican cultures to being featured in popular games and anime.\n\nSo go ahead and ask me anything about ocarinas, my music, content creation, the museum project, or anything else you\u2019re curious about. I\u2019ll be answering questions for the next few hours. Thanks for joining me!\n\nPROOF: [https://i.imgur.com/1BAuSGA.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/1BAuSGA.jpeg)\n\nSOCIALS: [Youtube](https://youtube.com/daviderickramos) | [Tiktok](https://tiktok.com/@daviderickramos) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DavidErickRamos) | [Instagram](https://instagram.com/daviderickramos_) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/07ohki4ZfUIYUCn7YVVtrP)\n\nEDIT: This was really fun, thanks for all the great questions everyone!! I have to run, but I'll check back later if anyone has any more questions. Feel free to follow me on my socials, I'm always posting new ocarina music and content! ",

You score points when the other players, within earshot, believe you. You are called to the, \"Premier of Truth\" when another player, having heard enough, shouts, \"Gullibologna!\" and they score a point if correct, however, if the first player is telling the truth, then they score 1, and the other player has a point deducted for their Faux Paw (Back in the day, trappers would occasionally find a broken stick in their trap because ravens would spring the traps to prevent other animals being hurt. The part of the stick that they found in the trap was called a faux paw, or \"Fake Foot\"which is how the term originated in Quebec, this is also why the term is not used in France.)

It's built into the instrument - the low notes or quiet and the high notes are loud. It's possible to manipulate that a bit, but it's for more advanced players. Also, ocarinas can be used as both concert pitch or transposing instruments. I made a [handy chart](https://imgur.com/a/UtpTmQn) to show the ranges of the 7 most popular ocarina keys/sizes.",

That's what I started with and you'd be surprised how many songs you can play with that. When you feel more comfortable with that, you can upgrade to a 6 hole to extend the range a bit!",

English pendants generally have 4 holes on top, but some can one or two thumb holes on the bottom. A 4 hole ocarina just doesn't have the thumbholes, so the transition should be pretty seemless. You can even get a 5 hole ocarina, which just has one thumbhole, which is easier to balance tbh.",

There are several types of ocarinas though, but the main difference is that ocarinas being an Italian invention (the word \"Ocarina\" is Italian for \"Little Goose\") must be tuned to a Western scale. \n\nAs for the museum, we're creating a website that will allow you to explore my 400+ ocarina collection through pictures, videos, and audio recordings of each piece as a way of digitally preserving not only the collection, but information about the people who made them and their cultures. There are very few reliable resources about ocarina history, as most of the information has been transferred by word of mouth. But I am collaborating with several ocarina historians who also have a good knowledge on the history and evolution of the ocarina, and we hope that this online museum will be a central resource for anyone interested in learning more about ocarinas and their history. \n\nWe're actually running a Kickstarter project to fund the whole thing, and you can find more info about that on my various social channels linked above!",

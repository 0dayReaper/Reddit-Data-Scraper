    "postText": "Three years ago my wife and I created a board game as a side hobby. It did way better than we expected so we took a risk and left our jobs to make games full time. We have now created 3 games, made over $1 million in revenue, and sell on Amazon, Kickstarter, and in stores. \n\nAsk me anything about making board games, quitting my job, working from home, or anything else!\n\nProof I am me: https://truepic.com/xmqa7dlu/\n\nLink to our 3rd game: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/travishancock/deadwood-1876-a-safe-robbing-game-of-teamwork-and\n\nLink to our website: http://facadegames.com",

Games turn people into \"gamers\" and then they buy more and more games :)\n\nCompared to something like a toothbrush. If I buy a toothbrush I don't need another one. If I buy a game, then I'll probably buy another one as I hold more game nights at my house, etc. It's a really cool industry. ",

When I first started off game collecting I was treated as any other customer. But when store owners realized I was a regular and chit chatted with them. I got told where to go for certain things and sometimes offered a lot of deals before things had the chance to hit store shelves. As a result I got a lot of common games for fraction of the cost as well as a bunch of rare gems for half the cost of ebay. Its crazy how far you can go by being polite and just asking a few questions.",

You could be closer but if you are not in the standard destination no one will think about you.\n\nSame with Hotels, 4 giant hotels opened up near me when there was nothing before. It made no sense at all to me. It all seemed co-ordinated. Only thing that made sense was if they all built right beside eachother they would become a hotel destination and people would stop there rather than going further into the city. One hotel by itself could just be ignored.",

You can't patent game mechanics, so there's that. \n\nSo much of the value of games is actually executing them right. Making it all come together. So someone who \"stole\" the idea of the game would still be years behind. Also the game community is very protective- if they see a copy of another game, then they will point out the faker and won't buy the new one. \n\nProfit is about 50% after all the manufacturing, shipping, advertising, illustration costs.

But my most recent favorites are Code Names, Pandemic, Ticket to Ride, King of Tokyo, One Night Werewolf.\n\nInspiration comes from testing our games a TON, playing other games, learning about history (our games all have historical tie ins), and traveling! Traveling really jogs the brain for creativity.\n\nHonestly I think the advances in technology make people want to go back to the basic cardboard and paper and tangible pieces in their hands. They need an escape from their phones and the mess of the internet. I think board games are getting more popular because of that.",

What parts of the design process are pitfalls to watch out for, in your opinion? How did you balance players who want to do nothing but betray in an initially cooperative game vs players who don't ever want to backstab?",

Reward them for staying just enough that they think about staying. But reward them for leaving if the opportunity comes up.

However how is the following \"evil circle\" solved?  \n  \n1) You need high quality artwork for your cards and board to make a good enough first impression for the kickstarter to kick off.  \n2) The primary reason for using kickstarter is to afford the most expensive part of making the boardgame in the first place, the artwork.  \n  \nI've spent 3 years designing a game, which is actually 100% completed in my head. I've paid 3000 dollars out of my own pocket but I'm still missing 3000 dollars more to complete the artwork for the game fully.   \n  \nMaybe I'm going about this the wrong way. But I'm aiming for a 100% complete game prototype including all artwork before the kickstarter, then intend to regain that loss through the kickstarter.  \n  \nTo be able to put aside 3000 dollars more for full completion, I will need to delay my kickstarter like 1-2 more years at this rate. Is there an easier way to solve this issue? How did you go about it? Am I doing it all wrong?  ",

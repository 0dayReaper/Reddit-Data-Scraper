If you want to ask more questions and stuff I will be around on the Bunny Ears Facebook page tomorrow night from 5pm (PST)-6:30pm along with a lot of the website staff. Check it out and listen to Matt Cohen talk on the podcast every wednesday. Also... buy a T-Shirt because THEY told me you wouldn't. ************\n\n\nIt's me, Macaulay Culkin. I'm back to talk about Rampart, my comedy website called [BunnyEars.com](https://bunnyears.com/), and my podcast which is also called [Bunny Ears](https://art19.com/shows/bunny-ears/).  What else? The website has a lot more cool stuff to read now and we're selling shirts and pins! Also, I've done more episodes of the podcast. We've got an [official Facebook page!](http://facebook.com/bunnyearsdotcom)  I'm older, wiser and ready for more of your Q's! Hit me! \n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/4dm5ykuk4cz01.jpg",

I know I can't eat it as fast as you but I think you'd be impressed with my speed. I love your hair, you act good. Did you have a good relationship with your father? Me neither. These are all things we can talk about and more. I know you have no been getting my letters because I know you would write back if you did. I hope you write back this time, and we can become good friends. I am sure our relationship would be a real home (alone) run!",

Your kid is a brat and says he wants to be left alone. You want to show him what it was like to be left alone and hire Harry and Marv to fake a break in to scare him. New bad guys catch them before they're able to get into the house, and tie them up. They now try to break into the home. Kevin's son gets scared, and finds dads old plans to thwart the robbers. After being hit in the head, stepping on glass and all other kinds of torture, the bad guys finally catch up with the kid. Just when it looks like they will do harm to him, we see Marv and Harry somehow escaped and attack them from behind to save the day. Kevin can't believe what happened, his son thinks he's a dick but says he loves him anyways, and we all live happily ever after. What do you think?",

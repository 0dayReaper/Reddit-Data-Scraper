    "postText": "UPDATE: I am getting ready for my interview with JJ Abrams and Andy Cruz at SF's City Arts &amp; Lectures tonight, so I have to go. I'll try to pop back later tonight if I can. Otherwise, thank you SO much for all your questions and support, and I hope to see some of you in person at Brain Candy Live or one of the upcoming comic-cons! In the meantime, take a listen to the podcasts I just did for Syfy, and let me know on Twitter (@donttrythis) what you think: http://www.syfy.com/tags/origin-stories\n\nThanks, everyone!\n\nORIGINAL TEXT: Since MythBusters stopped filming two years ago (right?!) I've logged almost 175,000 flight miles and visited and filmed on the sets of multiple blockbuster films (including Ghost in the Shell, Alien Covenant, The Expanse, Blade Runner), AND built a bucket list suit of armor to cosplay in (in England!). I also launched a live stage show called Brain Candy with Vsauce's Michael Stevens and a Maker Tour series on Tested.com. \n\nAnd then of course I just released 15 podcast interviews with some of your FAVORITE figures from science fiction, including Neil Gaiman, Kevin Smith and Jonathan Frakes, for Syfy.\n\nBut enough about me. It's time for you to talk about what's on YOUR mind. Go for it. \n\nProof: https://twitter.com/donttrythis/status/908358448663863296",

The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than 8, and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\n\n***Durable Summons.*** Any creature that Lord Savage summons or creates with a conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.\n\n***Focused Conjuration.*** While he is concentrating on a conjuration spell, Lord Savage's concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.\n\n***Spellcasting.*** Lord Savage is a 16th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence, and he uses a +2 arcane focus (spell save DC 16, +10 to hit with spell attacks). Lord Savage has the following wizard spells prepared:\n\n* Cantrips (at will): *create bonfire, mage hand, mending, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*\n* 1st level (4 slots): *catapult, grease, mage armor, magic missile, shield*\n* 2nd level (3 slots): *cloud of daggers, flaming sphere, pyrotechnics*\n* 3rd level (3 slots): *fireball, fly, haste*\n* 4th level (3 slots): *fabricate, leomund's secret chest, stone shape*\n* 5th level (2 slots): *animate objects, conjure elemental*\n* 6th level (1 slot): *circle of death, contingency*\n* 7th level (1 slot): *Mordenkainen\u2019s Sword*\n* 8th level (1 slot): *incendiary cloud*\n\n####Actions\n___\n\n***+2 Tinker's Staff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, or 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage if wielded with two hands. If the target is a construct, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by Lord Savage for 1 minute, ignoring any charm immunity the target possesses. While charmed, a construct must obey Lord Savage's exact commands. A charmed creature can repeat its save each time it is forced to deal damage to a friendly creature, as well as each time Lord Savage deals damage to it.\n\n***Minor Conjuration.*** Lord Savage conjures up an inanimate object in his hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that he can see within 10 feet of him. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that he has seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet. The object disappears after 1 hour, when Lord Savage uses this feature again, or if it takes any damage.\n\n***Benign Transposition (Recharges After a Short or Long Rest).*** Lord Savage teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that he can see. Alternatively, he can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, both he and it teleport, swapping places.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n___\n\n*Edit: Fixed proficiency bonus miscalculation. Added charm immunity circumvention on Tinker's Staff.*",

One you were almost 100% certain would go one way and when it went the opposite you almost couldn't believe it.\n\nThanks for doing this!!",

As you went through the long history of your resume, the juggling routine you were simultaneously performing became more and more complex.  Your final note, the point of the whole story, was that you discovered you enjoy everything, and further, are good at most things you put your hands and mind to.  Not everyone can find that one passion, that one pursuit. \n\n\nAs a young man who has bounced from job to job, idea to idea, and motivation to motivation, this spoke volumes to me.  I just wanted to thank you for the inspiration and reassurance, and to tell you and others that I think about this moment more times than I can count. ",

I've [published 3 books](https://www.mermaidraina.com/books.html) about it, gotten to be in various [film productions](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9198911/), swam in the largest research aquarium in North America, met a few celebs, encountered cool wild animals, and got cut from Netflix's Merpeople series \ud83d\ude02 Ive done a few of these over the years and lots is always changing. I figure with mermaids in the media recently, I can answer some questions and share some fun...tails? \ud83e\udddc AMA but dont be a mervert.",

Most are born in captivity and can't be released, but this facility will keep them in ocean but still have access to food and vet care without performing or photo ops etc. I am hoping to volunteer with them. There will always be rare outliers and situations such as Winter the dolphin and the work they do at her facility, but overall I hope the world follows suit with Canada.",

(mertailor is my tail maker and his portrayal is fairly honest and accurate)  \nOthers was very heavily scripted and faked and VERY harmful IMO.   \nI think the team making it had good intentions but some subjects are dishonest. I think some reviews really picked up on who.  \nPaying to swim in aquariums and spinning it as a sought after gig. Staged pageants (which are generally looked down on in most instances as unrelated money grabs). Spinning this crazy cut throat gatekeeping nature which is one person's ego and not at all the reality.   \nI plan to make some video reviews fact checking each episode. My most concerning thing is someone claiming to be elite and then willfully putting someone in danger and acting like that is in any way a job expectation. A lot of us OG performers were cut from it I think maybe we're too boring because there's no drama, all safety, and swimming in our own lane lol. \n\nI also worry about folks like Blix who I know. No one got paid and he is currently living in shelters. I worry a lot about exploitation.",

    "postText": "Hey, it's [Brian Baumgartner](https://www.instagram.com/bbbaumgartner/)! I portrayed Kevin Malone (accounting guru and chili master) on NBC's The Office and I'm here today to discuss my new podcast, \u201cAn Oral History of The Office\", hosted by yours truly. I've teamed up with Spotify to give you a show that features interviews with the cast and creators, and reveals some never-before-heard stories from the people who knew the series the best.  The 12-episode podcast will be available exclusively on Spotify on 7/14. Immersive, intimate, emotional and elevated, the podcast pulls back the curtain on what went into creating this unstoppable force in American popular culture and shares the theories as to why it remains such an important part of the cultural zeitgeist. \n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/wzhlzzbkla951.jpg",

Another funny one is when Jim pops the big exercise ball that Dwight is sitting on in the opening of one episode. There's an interview with John Krasinski where he said they kept having to reshoot that scene for some reason. Every time he would stab the ball with the scissors it would slowly let the air out of the ball and Dwight would just slowly sink out of frame behind the desk. On the last take when he stabs the ball instead of slowly letting the air out the ball basically explodes and Dwight just drops right to the floor. It was totally unexpected so you can see John start to laugh and quickly run to the side to get out of the frame.",

The cast did a table read on Zoom a few weeks ago and Pedro Pascal filled a guest role. At one point he lost it completely, because the dialog is over the top. They went all in on the jokes but it is delivered in dry legal parlance. It was very well written and performed despite the IRL acrimony.",

So I have always wondered, during the basketball scrimmage episode there is a short clip of you shooting the basketball and it is such a smooth jumper. Have you played basketball a lot growing up? And what is your favorite team if you have one? Also, thoughts on who will win the NBA Finals this year if it is happening? \n\nMuch love stay safe Kevin/Brian, you sweet sweet soul",

Even 15 years after the release of the show, we are still getting a lot of new information. Office Ladies, The book, Etc. With all that, are there any new secrets left for us in your podcast? \ud83d\ude05",

Water. Multiple shots out of the bunkers. Extra chips. If you focus on not giving away those things- score will improve. Good luck",

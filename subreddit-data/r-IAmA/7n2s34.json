    "postText": "Hello, my name is Anatole Konstantin. You can click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2dt68p/iama_survivor_of_stalins_dictatorship_my_father/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4xum3y/iama_survivor_of_stalins_dictatorship_and_im_back/) to read my previous AMAs about growing up under Stalin, what life was like fleeing from the Communists, and coming to America as an immigrant. After the killing of my father and my escape from the U.S.S.R. I am here to bear witness to the cruelties perpetrated in the name of the Communist ideology. \n\n2017 marks the 100th anniversary of the Communist Revolution in Russia. My latest book, \"[A Brief History of Communism: The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire](http://www.anatolekonstantin.com/communism/)\" is the story of the men who believed they knew how to create an ideal world, and in its name did not hesitate to sacrifice millions of innocent lives. \n\nThe President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has said that the demise of the Soviet Empire in 1991 was the greatest tragedy of the twentieth century. My book aims to show that the greatest tragedy of the century was the creation of this Empire in 1917.\n\nMy grandson, Miles, is typing my replies for me.\n\nHere is my [proof](https://i.imgur.com/fCDqUIQ.jpg).\n\nVisit my website [anatolekonstantin.com](http://www.anatolekonstantin.com) to learn more about my story and my books.\n\nUpdate (4:22pm Eastern): Thank you for your insightful questions. You can read more about my time in the Soviet Union in my first book, \"[A Red Boyhood: Growing Up Under Stalin](http://www.anatolekonstantin.com/boyhood)\", and you can read about my experience as an immigrant in my second book, \"[Through the Eyes of an Immigrant](http://www.anatolekonstantin.com/immigrant/)\". My latest book, \"[A Brief History of Communism: The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire](http://www.anatolekonstantin.com/communism/)\", is available from [Amazon](http://a.co/5DdAiiQ). I hope to get a chance to answer more of your questions in the future. ",

At one point things got so bad that he had to steal meat for the family from his own factory.  An incident occurred where they were cooking the meat at home and the Bolsheviks happened to come by the house.  My great great grandmother helped one of the kids (my great grandfather) out of the kitchen window along with the meat and had the kid run into the woods.  The Bolsheviks could smell that something was cooking but could not find anything in the house.  My great great grandfather was detained for some time after that.",

For the younger defectors, it's probably easier to assimilate, but for the older folks it's probably difficult as hell. \n\nThere's also a huge discrepancy between the two languages even though they're both Korean-- apparently close to 30% of the vocabulary is completely different and they sometimes need translators to understand the other Korean language. Korean speakers can distinguish between North Koreans and South Koreans by their accent, which allows South Koreans to discriminate more easily against North Korean defectors. \n\nMany North Korean defectors are treated with prejudice as most minorities are-- which should be obvious but is something I didn't really consider since the Koreans have been divided for less than a century.\n\nProbably irrelevant and unnecessary information but I just thought it was super fascinating and wanted to share.",

Not necessarily stealing from each other, but trying to steal from the regime? \nDid people often steal from each other, or was there more of a group mentality, of we're all in this together?\nWas there an element of needing to steal to survive, or live in otherwise unbearable conditions?\nAny information or perspectives you could give on the world of petty crimes would be interesting to me.",

During the collectivization of farmers, theft from the collective farm of a handful of grain stalks needed for survival was considered a crime punishable by years of imprisonment. People stole because there were shortages of everything and among the population, stealing from the government was not viewed as a real crime. In general, petty crime was common. \n\nEdit: People had to remove windshield wipers when they parked their cars for fear of them being stolen. ",

So in relative purchasing power, the cheapest car (ZAZ, Fiat 600 clone) might have been roughly $50,000 for today's America family, a Lada $100,000, a Volga (the most expensive car for mere mortal to buy), $200,000. About as many people who could buy a $100,000 car today would have been able to buy a car in USSR. (Far fewer leasing or fractional payment options, though)",

Significant secession movements still do continue at the seams. Only now, ~70yrs past independence, have we gotten confident enough to allow even simple things - which are considered obvious in more federal systems like the US - such as more of a direct share in tax revenue for states.   \n\nI think one of the things that protects democracy/federalism in India is - unlike China/Russia - there actually is not much history/widespread cultural memory/acceptance here of a strong authoritarian leader ever ruling over the whole unified landmass for any significant amount of time. For thousands of years, its always been a relatively loose federation.\n\nMeanwhile, there currently is a vocal minority that fetishizes Chinese/Russian type single party or semi-dictatorial systems with a 'strong man' leader as the way to go. Recent elections have allowed the current PM to start projecting himself as this leader. Lets see how it goes. The last person to try this ended up assassinated by her bodyguards!",

So many people see only what they want to see.\n\nEdit: after some responses and questions I went to talk to my father about the family history. Turns out my direct family (grandfather, pregnant grandmother) left Cuba because my grandfather, a doctor, helped both Batista's men and the men they were fighting during a shootout. Batista put 500,000$ on my grandfather's head for aiding the others. They also disagreed with Batista and later Castro, who ran the rest of my family out of Cuba. \n\nMy father said to relay a few things, first that Batista was bad, no denying that, but Castro was worse in his opinion. Batista was a murderer, but he mostly just messed with the political class and left the rest alone if they didn't interfere with the money. Castro messed with everyone, and ran the country into the ground.\n\nMy grandfather, Maximo/Luly Viera, was smuggled out, while his cousin Mingolo was not. Mingolo was on Batista's bad side, so he was caught, shot 150 times, and thrown on his mother's front porch. \n\nEdit 2: My father said to post, if communism was so good they wouldn't need fences and walls and machine guns to keep people in.

Every attempt at implementing communism started out with good intentions and failed.

I stumbled late onto your AMA last year and commented on how influential [your book was to me while I was in high school](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4xum3y/iama_survivor_of_stalins_dictatorship_and_im_back/d6j23de/). Your grandson Miles came across my message on that thread and reached out to me last week that you'll be doing an AMA and again reached out earlier today to let me know it was up - thank you, Miles! This actually reminded me the book would be a great gift for my sister who is interested in studying 20th century history - I found the last hardcopy on amazon at the moment :D \n\nI have a few questions if you are able to answer:\n\n* Are you still speaking at local schools on life in the USSR? Do you have comments from speaking with students/teachers on your life? You comment on how education does not sufficiently emphasize lessons from history, and I think hearing and seeing someone speak, or writing personal accounts, will likely always be a lesson that finds more connection than watching an aged documentary or reading from a dry school textbook.\n\n* Apart from writing, do you have other hobbies?\n\n* Do you think communist or other harsh political ideologies would be harder or easier to find root today compared to the early 20th century?\n\nThank you - best of luck to you and your family in your business and personal endeavors!",

Some people only agree with free speech when the speech aligns with their point of view.\n\nI'm sick and tired of people here that posts videos/images of nazis being physically attacked while they are not doing anything against the law. Real free speech means to tolerate even the hateful and moronic speech of a nazi.\n\nAnd before any douchebag with lack of text interpretation says that I'm supporting nazism, I'm a black guy that was attacked twice by neonazis in Russia.\n\n**Edit:** Maybe \"tolerate\" wasn't the wisest word to use here, but what I'm trying to say is that I don't think anybody should be physically assaulted for saying or believing in something, even if their belief is absolutely disgusting.\n\n**Edit 2:** Thanks for the gold, kind stranger.

Not to divert into Russian cinema, but their version of 12 Angry Men, called simply \"12\" was brilliant.\n\nI met a fellow in 1980 who emigrated to the U.S. from Leningrad in 1979. He called himself a 3-time loser in the U.S.S.R. since he was Jewish, had been divorced twice, and was denounced (not sure if that's the correct word) by his PhD advisor who had stolen his thesis.\n\nHe was only allowed to emigrate because he had a brother in the West who would sponsor him. He mentioned this as an aside that the U.S.S.R. actually cared that their people could leave with some assurance on the outside.\n\nSome of the quirks I recall were- he said there were no maps available in Leningrad, or they were wrong because the government felt the people not having maps would not be able to foment any organized revolts or protest.\n\nWe went shopping to a local food store in our city of, say 70,000 at the time, which had maybe 8-10 supermarkets. He took pictures of the food aisles to send home to his mom. It was akin to a religious experience for him.  He said Leningrad also had about that many supermarkets, but they were all empty.\n\nHe thought American women were airheads, frivolous, lol, but he met a good one and got married.\n\nI used to take him for driving lessons in his new used, Pontiasha, first car ever- so he could get a license. The few times he saw a state trooper parked or in traffic, he got really scared, paranoid that they knew he was Russian and were keeping tabs on him. I laughed it off, told him he wasn't that important.\n\n I am as big a critic of American culture and gov't as anyone, but this guy made me appreciate again and again the many things we take for granted in the U.S. every day. He was oblivious to anything but how great it was.\n\nHe thought then that the U.S.S.R. (think Brezhnev) would last 1000 years. He declared it vehemently, sadly. I told him not to hold his breath, lol,  but I had no more idea than he that things would transpire as they did.\n\n",

The communists were pursued and slaughthered after the coup in 1973, with the Nixon administration supporting the chilean oligarchy in setting up the economic disaster that lead up to the socialist government downfall. A lot of families are still mourning their relatives without knowing where their bodies are or what happened to them.\n\nSo, my question is: What is your take on the US meddling with foreign governments and setting up dictatorships during the Cold War in the name of their ideology?

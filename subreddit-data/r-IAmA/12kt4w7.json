    "postText": "I spent years sleeping underneath Lemmy from Motorhead\u2026 on a tour bus. I feuded with the members of Black Sabbath, tripped mushrooms on stage with Hawkwind, faced down the Hells Angels and escalated band prank wars. I threw Madonna off stage, turned down an invite from Nelson Mandela (big regret), and dealt with the aftermath of Chumbawamba drenching John Prescott.\n\nThrough hard drinking and hard times, I worked hard, refusing to conform to others\u2019 expectations. You maybe have some expectations yourself, hearing \u2018Kim Hawes, tour manager\u2019 \u2013 let me know if my picture matches them! I blazed a trail through the male-dominated music industry, carving out a place for women in a largely man\u2019s world, taking no crap and no prisoners while getting results other tour managers only dreamed of.\n\nThis is your chance to ask about antics on the road, the nitty gritty of the music business from selling merch to taking care of the money and hear fresh stories about the famous names you think you know. Or ask me about the writing and publishing process of my new book, Lipstick and Leather! Can\u2019t wait to hear what you\u2019ve got for me, Ask Me Anything!\n\nEDIT: so many great questions guys, thanks for being here with me this evening! I've answered as many as I can for now but if you want to keep sending them in, I'll try and drop back in a couple of days and answer a few more. If you can't wait that long, the book is out now ;) It's been fun!\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://i.postimg.cc/wxQJR0SX/AMA-proof.jpg)!",

The band get him up onstage- maybe the roadies drag him up? I forget, handcuff him to the rig, strip him naked and cover him in spray cheese. \n\nThe guy goes to the police and Lemmy and Phil get arrested. After explaining their side, the police officer says, in a strong Scandinavian accent, something along the lines of \"but zis is no reason to cover a man in cheese.\"\n\n[22 minutes in this video, Lemmy and Phil Campbell talks about the incident. ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MZu1OBZly8Y#bottom-sheet)",

It was me saying \"Hey lemmy, I know who you are but I'm not going to fan-boy all over you\" \n\nI worked a bit as a bartender at a Canadian legion in the 80's and while the vets certainly didn't pick me as the first guy to talk about the war to, I did get to talk some/evesdrop on conversations.  \n\nAt the end of the day the % of casualties on Omaha and Juno weren't that far apart. \n\n3 of the 4 beaches on D-day held for 30 minutes (more or less) and Omaha held for 4 hours.  The pre-invasion bombing run on Omaha missed the beaches by quite a bit (you can look up why elsewhere).  Of the 22 or so Sherman tanks that were to land on the beach only 1 made it ashore.  \n\nHad the bombers hit the beaches some damage would have been done, communications would have been interrupted, and Omaha would have been a bit safer of a beach.  If half the tanks made it ashore instead of 1 then there would have been a dozen cannons firing at targets as well as heavy machine guns also forcing the Germans to keep their heads down.  If the plans went according to plan Omaha while still being a tough beach would have been easier to get across and the casualty % would have gone down, Juno went according to plan (as much as possible, nobody planned on tunnels under the town). \n\nWatch the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan but picture a couple of tanks operating for even just a few minutes, a lot more guys would have gotten across the beaches and potentially up the bluffs in places. \n\nedit: The implication being that the casulaty % on Juno was what it was while the % on Gold, Sword and Utah were what they were while had Omaha going according to plan it'd have been a lot safer beach to land on.  So as of June 5th Juno was the worst beach to be heading towards. \n\nSure, it's a lot of what-if's but the idea behind the statement was to engage Lemmy in a conversation.",

As for the career: I was just sort of in the right place at the right time. I always loved music and going to gigs, and it's a long story (in the book, can't blame a girl for plugging) but when this particular band was down a merch seller, I was there and had cash handling experience. What can I say, they were desperate. I did well that tour and it all grew from there!\n\nUnfortunately I never met Ozzy: I was with Black Sabbath later when Ronnie James Dio was the front man. I guess you could call never meeting Ozzy himself a professional regret! Thanks for all the questions :)",

I never really got into metal but I can remember clear as day a time twenty years ago when my uncle put Paranoid on his record player. I was only seven or eight at the time and while I liked music from a young age, I was completely taken aback when that long drawn out nasty riffing came in with the air raid sirens on War Pigs. That was a very formative experience for me and I just had to figure out what he was doing, thus beginning my own journey as a musician. I ended up being a bluegrass and country guy funny enough, but have always had a soft spot in my heart for his playing and still crank the gain on my amp for some sludgy goodness every now and then. Always wondered what the man himself was like, he never seemed to show much in interviews and the like.\n\nOh, and a hearty congratulations on the book (and an exciting career!) from me as well, you sound like a complete badass and I look forward to reading the book!",

Obviously if you're managing a band on tour, it's got to feel nice knowing that the potential for chaos is pretty minimal, but would you or others involved ever feel like this detracted from the experience at all? Is your time on the job more interesting and fulfilling in ways you appreciate when it's chaotic and entertaining, or does that just end up being exhausting, even for a 20-something in the industry?",

Don't know where Skip ended up but Geddy ended up in the elevator, going up and down the floors all night!\n\nIn terms of the job question: maybe because of my 10 years with Motorhead - where I started on merch selling and went up to tour manager so it was my first managing experience - after that I always got the chaotic bands on the grounds that I could handle it! I thrived on the chaos. There was never a dull moment.",

BUT it always depends on who the band is and how many people they can afford to take on the road. I routinely remember 75 crew members. That would be roadies - all kinds of different niche jobs there, riggers, carpenters, wardrobe, make up artists, hairdressers. Then the merch sellers, bodyguards, sound and lighting engineers... I could go on but I'll finish with sometimes, caterers. A tour, like an army, marches on its stomach.\n\nI've had many trades (see above re: Motorhead's chemists!) but the oddest apart from this was a dentist for a certain rock star frightened that their new caps might fall out!\n\nAs for sleeping, often the answer was, what sleep? When you did, it was usually on a tour bus - big tours have fleets of these things - but on a really good night you'd get the Presidential Suite of a hotel you could never afford in real life.",

When I first started out, a tour manager's job was just that, I was in charge, but as mobiles and emails became popular, there was less autonomy and the label would take a direct hand in things. From the bands' POV, things can be changed more easily - dates added, interviews planned. And I think it's created this culture where more people are doing it for the money and/or fame rather than the music.",

You know who you are - a gig in Norfolk and a gig on sunset strip! When I got this reaction they'd often try to mess me and by extension the band around.\n\nBest crowds were usually at the festivals.

I started out at 18 washing dishes backstage at an amp and worked my way up from there, and have been working in the industry full time since graduating college. I did my first tour last year, and have had several more offers this year, including my first eu tour! \n\nMy question is, how do you get people to take you seriously as a woman, and in my case a very young woman in positions of authority? I'm under 25, and I look under 25. Because even though I've done hundreds of shows, thousands of hours, I still have trouble controlling situations with a certain personality type. My (hopefully soon!) next career step is a venue management position, where oftentimes the buck will stop with me. What advice do you have for growing that confidence and dealing with these people?\n\nYou are a huge role model for me and reading your responses has been so awesome. Thank you for doing this!!!!",

Believe - no, know that you're damn good at what you do, you know what you're talking about and you're worth listening to. Lemmy gave me a piece of advice early on which boiled down to 'fake it till you make it' and I stand tall by that. There's always a feeling as a woman that you have to be twice as good as a man - I'm sure you are, since you're being notice already, so go out there and kill it!",

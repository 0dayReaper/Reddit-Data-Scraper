    "postText": "My name is [Derek Bloch](https://www.youtube.com/user/dbloch7986). \n\nI am not the typical \"high-ranking\" or celebrity Scientologist. I am more familiar with the low-level, day-to-day activities of cult members than anything else. I was exposed to some of the worst kinds of abuse, but compared to some of the other stories I have heard I got away relatively unscathed (and I am thankful for that). [Now I live on my own as a lower-middle-class, married, gay man.](https://truepic.com/gx54exce) \n\nFTR: I have been going to therapy for years. That's helped me gain some insight into myself and the damage that Scientology and my parents did me when I was younger. That's not to say I'm not an emotional and psychological wreck, because I kinda still am sometimes! I'm not a licensed psychologist but I think therapy has given me the tools to objectively understand my experience and writing about it is cathartic. Hence, the AMA.\n\n[First I shared an anonymous account of my story online to a board specifically for ex-Scientologists.](http://www.forum.exscn.net/threads/a-brief-summary-of-my-time-inside.26189/#post656666) It's important to note there are two distinct religious separations in my life: (1) is when I was kicked out of the Sea Org at age 18 (literally 2 days after my birthday) because I developed a relationship with someone who also had a penis; and (2) is when I left Scientology at age 26 altogether after sharing my story publicly.\n\nAfter Scientology's PR Police hunted me down using that post, my parents threw me out. On my way out, my dad called me a &gt;!\"pussy\"!&lt; for sharing my story anonymously. He also said he didn't raise his son to be a &gt;!\"faggot\"!&lt;. &gt;!{Side note that this is the same guy who told me to kill myself because I am gay during separation #1 above.}!&lt;\n\n[Being the petty person that I am, I of course spoke to a journalist and went very public about all of it immediately after.](https://www.villagevoice.com/2012/05/16/scientology-disconnection-and-homophobia-derek-blochs-story/)\n\n&gt;!(Ef yoo dad.)!&lt;\n\n[I also wrote a Cracked listicle (full disclosure they paid me $100 for that).](http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1328-5-disturbing-things-i-learned-in-scientologys-space-navy.html)\n\nI tried to do an Aftermath-style show but apparently there were some issues with the fact that they paid me $500 to appear on the show (that was about $5-$7/hr worth of compensation). So it was shelved. Had I known that would be a determining factor it would have been easy to refuse the money. Production staff said it was normal and necessary. [Here is the story about that experience (and it was awful and I am still pissed that it didn't air, but w/e.)](https://tonyortega.org/2017/07/27/derek-bloch-on-fighting-scientology-disconnection-in-an-unaired-tv-series-2/)\n\nObviously, I don't have any documentation about my conversations with the FBI, but that happened too. You'll just have to take my word for it.\n\n*On that note, I am 95% sure this post will get buried by Scientology, overlooked by the sub because of timing, or buried by higher-quality content. I might even get sued, who knows. I don't really care anymore!* \n\n*I'll be popping in when I get some notifications, but otherwise I'm just assuming this will disappear into the* [abyss of the interweb tubes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cZC67wXUTs)*.*\n\n^(PS: Please don't yell at me for being overweight. I have started going to the gym daily in the last few months so I am working on it!)\n\n# AMA!",

Their existence wouldn't bother me so much if their employees were paid a living wage and had insurance plans. They also shouldn't be forced to live on-site and should be allowed vacation and sick time.\n\n&gt; What's the best way to raise awareness about their shady dealings?\n\nI think that there is plenty of this going on at this time.

Your input on this would be very very helpful.\n\nShe hasn't said anything directly about the church, but has started to talk heavily about Tesla's energy device, how she has found a way to mix science and religion (although she hates the word 'religion'), and has said a few times stuff  about having a \"soul\" family. As well as when I pose simple questions she says stuff like. \"Proof, ha yes, they said people would be like this\"... LIKE what? Who mum?\n\nAll this came about shortly after I believe my mum had a mental breakdown. She hasn't been the same and I'm now tiptoeing around this stuff with her. \n\nShe lives in a different state to me now and her husband would not believe this shit. But when we catch up it seems like she is very consumed by what ever it is she has discovered. \n\nI am worried for her. They seems to have told her very specific stuff to fit the narrative of her mental breakdown and says she has seen 'proof' of her beliefs. \n\nWhen I've questioned some stuff in a very gentle manner. She gets defensive and almost breaks down in tears. \n\nDo you have suggestions of what sort of questions to ask, or how I can help her see the errors of Scientology with out alienating her and pushing her further away? Even basic stuff like, Tesla's free energy device, which \"gathers energy from an energy we can't detect yet\" I explained that yes... It gathers energy from radiowaves, just that it's so inefficient it wouldn't work. NOPE not true apparently. She's seen proof. \n\nWhat are some really obvious logic steps that I can point her to that may make her see what Scientology is really about. What helps people see that it is just scam that treats people like shit?\n\nI love my mum so much, she just doesn't seem the same since all of this happened. I don't what to do.\n\n",

From 14 to about 26/27 Having lived through this hell myself as a kid I wasn't going to ask any questions, but as I was stalking the comment section I noticed one of the first things you listed as a catalyst for new membership.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Death of a loved one\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is EXACTLY how they got my parents and I still blame them for the actual death of my mother to this day. They were desperate, she had cancer. Basically they convinced her that she didn't need and definitely should not subject herself to treatment. That she didn't need it and that it was more poison than treatment. They could just audit it out. Clearly she was just infected with interstellar negativity emanating from invisible space ghosts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe died a long and extremely slow and painful death and my sister and I had to watch her waste away and cry in pain on a daily basis in between the audits at the DC area location of this place. I don't think it was the main DC building, but I could be wrong because it's been decades, but I know for a fact it was at least on the way to DC in Maryland. She ultimately did seek treatment before dying, but by then it was too late. had she not listened to these people and gotten treatment started immediately? Her Doc said she most likely would have survived, or at least given herself several more years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will not call them a church. They are not a church.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMan, just reading this and commenting has got my adrenalin up to 1000. There's so much more bad behind the readers digest version of my experience with Scientology and the whole thing honestly. I've got PTSD from that time in my life that I am still dealing with in my 40s. For instance in addition to the adrenalin I am physically shaking so hard that I keep hitting the wrong keys and having to retype my sentences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm glad you got out. I hope more people do soon as well. Thank you so much for doing this AMA!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: over\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

It's that simple.

                    "comment": "When I first joined I was working about 10 hours a day doing all kinds of manual labor and janitorial work. The other 6 hours I would study stuff written by Hubbard. Then shower and sleep. There were a couple of meals in-between.\n\nAfter this I worked 17 - 24 hours a day (occasionally went several days without sleep) for 365 days a year.\n\nI moved to working in the basement of the Advanced Organization of Los Angeles where I was responsible for computerizing their central files. These files contain letters and invoice documents written to and by anyone that had ever bought anything from the organization over the life of the organization. I was also responsible for installing CAT 5 connections all over the building so people could access the computerized system. (15 years old)\n\nAfter this I worked in one of the areas where Scientologists go to study. I was a customer service rep. I basically managed complaints, monitored people for tardiness and reported them if they weren't on-time to class, called people who didn't show up to classes they were scheduled for, helped people go take exams for courses they finished, signed up people for new courses, kept a log book, cleaned the classrooms, cleaned the film room, put on films for students who were studying courses that required them, cleaned the projector, performed maintenance on tape deks/CD players that people used to study their course materials, ran errands for the instructors and other general classroom upkeep. I was generally here from 7-8am until about 12-1am each day. My whereabouts were accounted for by the people I worked for at all times. (15 - 16 years old)\n\nThen I was moved to the sales area. There I served as an assistant to a sales person. I processed credit card payments, transcribed documents, wrote letters to Scientologists trying to sell them things, served coffee and tea to customers, cleaned up the sales area at the end of the day, cleaned the bathrooms by the sales area, ran errands for sales people and other ad hoc things. I was not allowed to leave my desk without telling the sales person I worked for where I was going and how long I would be gone. I was here from 7am until 1am most days. (16 years old)\n\nAfter this I was transferred to Florida where most of my work was studying L. Ron Hubbard texts to prepare me for different lines of work down the road. This was a bit easier assignment than my other ones and I cherished it. I was assigned here because I was submissive and didn't cause too much trouble in my earlier positions. Eventually, this position would get me in trouble because I caught feelings for a fellow staff member who was male. I was typically studying from about 8am until 12 am each day. My whereabouts were not as monitored. I could wander off for about 2-3 hours without being noticed by someone if I wanted to. However, I was in a totally different state that was 3,000 miles from home so there was nowhere for me to go. (16 - 17 years old)\n\nOn my way out I was sent to work in the tunnels under L. Ron Hubbard Way in Hollywood, CA. Down there I was assigned to organize moldy storerooms of items and files, box up and ship books to people, ad hoc manual labor and janitorial work, and shred papers in an industrial shredder. I took advantage of being on the way out and typically started work at 9am and was in bed by 10pm. This was simultaneously the best and worst part of my trafficking experience in that I got lots of sleep but I also couldn't stop thinking about killing myself over the humiliation.",

Over casual conversation I learned he was \"Serving his time like missionary work for his religion\", but he could only answer emails between the hours of 4pm and 11am or some funky \"work hours\".  \n\nAt the time I was intrigued because when I was about 13, I was driving with my dad around 2am on Gilman Springs Rd, this road goes right through the middle of the complex (They've tried to take possession many times, but legally they have no right to it). While driving through I saw a group of roughly 100 people in all white garb digging out the foundation of the building with buckets.  \n\nSo seeing this, hearing the stories before all the big media stories started coming out, I always knew something wasn't right about the \"religion\". Just wondering if we happen to have worked together in the past and if so, glad to see you are doing well :)",

I can explain the e-mail situation: Scientology buffers employees from being able to freely send and receive e-mails by caching them on a system not directly connected to the internet. They download them from there and upload them to another system that is connected to the internet. At least, that's how it was done during my time 17 years ago.\n\nThe digging out was probably back when the base got flooded during a rainstorm. If you're interested you should check out Mark Headley's book \"Blown for Good\". He worked there for years and years and even talks about the time the base flooded really badly.",

They probably don't even know who the \"Shelly\" is in the \"Where's Shelly?\" posters and chants. You could probably count the number of regular Scientologists that know who Shelly is on one hand.",

Rather, it's more important to encourage your friend or relative to think about the things that the Scientologists are telling them. This person should be asking themselves and the Scientologists tough questions. This kind of confrontation and critical thinking is uncomfortable, but that discomfort is the voice in their head telling them \"this is wrong\".\n\nScientologists who are recruiting new members go to great lengths to discourage them from mentioning their budding involvement to family or friends. Scientologists don't do this because they know that Scientology is bullshit or anything. It's because they want other people to believe in Scientology too. It validates their own belief.\n\nYou can always sit them down at a computer with you and look for \"Operating Thetan Levels\" and read the craziness that is Scientology right there with them. I'm sure that'll kill their mystery.\n\nUsually, people who are considering joining a cult are having some kind of life-changing experience. It could be an existential crisis, loss of a loved one, loss of a job, divorce, etc. Rather than trying to turn them away from Scientology, I would look deeper at the problem they are trying to solve with Scientology. Then you can help them find the resources that would actually be helpful and effective for that problem. Often times, these real resources (as opposed to the fake resource that is Scientology) are a fraction of what Scientology costs or entirely free.",

A lot of people stick around for that reason, actually.\n\nSome people just suffer from the sunken cost fallacy, thinking that they have spent so much time and money on this that they have to stick with it. Or they just don't want to face the admission of defeat that's required when you finally realize it's all bullshit.\n\nSome of them are born into Scientology and have never known anything else.\n\nStill, a lot of them leave. I would guess that over the years millions of people were exposed to Scientology's recruitment methods. At their biggest, the membership of the organization was thought to be about 100k people. So we're talking 5% - 10% of people stick around. There's probably a mental health statistic for personality disorders that would explain why that percent of people stick around. All of this is just conjecture on my part though.",

This is where they believe some of the biggest secrets of the universe are revealed. These are kept secret from Scientologists and only revealed to them after anywhere from 3 - 10 years and $500k - $1,000k invested in the cult.\n\nThis is despite the fact that the information is available in the public domain for free because of Scientology's own screw up in court. If Scientologists run into this before they are \"officially\" exposed to it in Scientology, they are told it is not real. This is what happened to me.\n\nHowever, when I was watching it my dad was in the room. When the story was about halfway through I looked at him and his pale face told me all I needed to know. In fact, this was one of the external catalysts that sent me looking for answers to my concerns outside of the cult-provided materials. (You did a good thing Trey and Matt.)",

I think that Aftermath will do a lot more good in terms of providing catharsis to other ex-Scientologists like myself, helping ex-Scientologists describe to others what their experience was like, and helping to innoculate people from joining the cult in the first place. I don't think it will do much in terms of influencing law enforcement, unfortunately.",

                    "comment": "&gt; Is Tom Cruise really that important in the church?\n\nThis question really has a few parts. \n\nFrom an external perspective, Tom Cruise is a champion for Scientology. He is essential to the existence of the cult in that he provides legitimacy through his public involvement. \n\nFrom an internal believer perspective, Scientologists understand the legitimacy granted to the cult by Tom Cruise and how important that is to the existence of Scientology. However, he does not have significant control over church matters and he is not a significant part of the day-to-day life of Scientologists. Some of the Scientologists who consider themselves more ~~zealous~~ dedicated to the cause are insulted by the way the current leader idolizes Cruise*.\n\nLastly, from a Church Management (really there is only one person who runs the Church and that's Miscavige) perspective, Tom Cruise makes them loads of money. In fact, though I never worked for him personally, people like me who are trafficked for labor by Scientology work for Cruise for free. They staff his house, assist his kids, do his PR, act as his publicist, design and build his custom cars, and other things like this. They are not compensated personally, although David Miscavige deposits Cruise's donations into accounts that only David Miscavige has control over.\n\n&gt; But are aliens really that important in Scientology?\n\nOh boy, you hit a gold mine here. Yes. Extraterrestrial life is integral to the Scientology belief system and experience. Don't let any Scientologist tell you otherwise and if they are do feel free to bluntly accuse them of lying. As a child, I grew up listening to my parents' stories about how they were aliens in a past life. One of them worked at an interstellar prison of sorts, the other designed spaceships with warp drives. I asked my dad to design one but he said that we don't have the tech necessary or something. (LOL) A large part of the \"alien\" story in Scientology is that the Solar System is surrounded by a screen that prevents us from making contact with the society that dominates the central part of the galaxy.\n\nOn a personal level, I am happily agnostic about intelligent extraterrestrial life. We have proof that bacteria once existed on Mars, so at least on that level aliens do or did most certainly exist. If there was intelligent life outside of Earth, I think that the laws of physics mean we won't make contact with each other until we are both out there exploring the universe. (hurry up Elon!)",

I do agree that the top leaders realize that membership is depleting, yet it is still the most rich and powerful cult in the world. Does Miscavige recruit a new leader to \"control\" all this money and real estate? Scientology is just bizarre and horrible. I hope that it goes away, but I'm not sure how with the amount of cash they have. \n\nFWIW, my husband inadvertently saved someone from scientology once. His friend was joining up and was giving them all his cash and belongings, but husband advised him to hide a vehicle and some cash in a storage locker in case he wanted to get away. Surprisingly, the guy listened and when it because obvious he was a slave in a cult he managed to escape, thanks to being able to access that vehicle. This was before internet, etc. so it was easier to keep them from knowing.\n\nI'm really sorry that the people tasked with protecting and loving you failed to do so. Children have little chance when being indoctrinated from a young age. \n",

Law enforcement needs to draft a strategic plan that works backwards from the people who are on the fringes of Scientology all the way to those who are most deeply involved. Coordination is the key and what makes it so hard. Scientology spends lots of money on local law enforcement in terms of donations to law enforcement charities and public relations activities to shield their abusive nature from view. Law enforcement needs to take a more cynical view of religious organizations in general. Which ties directly into your comment about the Catholic Church. They too are given too much benefit of a doubt.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't be surprised if secret Scientologists worked for LAPD, LASD, Riverside sheriff's, Cleawater, FL PD and so on. They have done it before and for more details on Scientology's crimes of espionage against the US Gov't you can look up \"Operation Snow White\". \n\nRevoking religious status would also go a long way in ending the cult. In fact, based on their espionage activities against the US Gov't in the 1970s, they should be declared an enemy of the US like ISIS (IMHO).\n\nIn my case, I think the reason the FBI didn't pursue it further is because my parents were complicit in trafficking for labor. They signed custody over to the cult and shipped me off. (Frankly, I think they were happy they didn't have to spend money caring for me anymore. They also felt like the fact that I was working for the cult gave them a sort of status within the cult.) The fact that my parents were complicit makes it hard to corroborate my story. \n\nAlthough, I gave them names and approximate dates related to my grooming before I was actually abducted and signed up for the labor force. It should be easy enough to interview those people and get documentation related to my time inside. There are also statutes of limitations to consider but the US Attorney could argue to extend it on my behalf. I can see how they justified not taking action based on my criminal complain. I also know there is a possibility they could have at least tried to prosecute it if they wanted to.\n\n&gt; Their actions are on the level of the Catholic church's cover-ups but they get more attention. Why do you believe this is, due to the widespread popularity of the religion or are there more legal and logistical issues?\n\nIf you look the government's history with cults, it's largely disastrous. I understand the reluctance of authorities to do anything. Scientology doesn't pose an immediate threat to the life or most members. It's mostly a Madoff-level investment scam, but with a spiritual twist. If anyone got hurt during a raid it would be totally unjustified. \n\nI think that it would be more helpful to prosecute Scientology from a labor law perspective. Forcing them to follow labor laws and pay workers a living wage (at least minimum wage), offer insurance, not employ minors, and other things that are required by law for normal businesses would go a long way at remedying the way this cult abuses its members.",

Some examples could be:\n* Death of a loved one\n* Unemployment, especially right after a recent job loss\n* Losing faith in a belief system\n* Addiction\n* Divorce\n\nSpecifically, I think it is when one of these events triggers an existential crisis. In other cases, Scientology fleeces people who are \"looking for deeper meaning\" in life, or something similar. Typically, the people who fall for cults are convinced that (1) they would never fall for a cult and (2) that they were meant for something greater in life. Think in terms of the \"mom's business\" MLM-types who are also being fleeced by cults, but financial cults rather than religious cults.\n\nIn my dad's case, he had lost his dad and his mom was dying. He was faced with running the family business by himself. Members of Scientology offered to help him manage the business through \"consulting\" based on L. Ron Hubbard's management techniques (which really are only useful in terms of managing things that Hubbard himself created which didn't include my dad's business). This was in 1995.",

Whether or not it is specifically to skirt tax laws is arguable, but there's no question they make use of the slave labor force of Scientology for personal benefit. They are also acutely aware of the abuse happening, it's just that Scientologists feel that the abuse of the slave force is justified in the name of the \"greater good\".",

I reached out to the [Human Trafficking Hotline](https://humantraffickinghotline.org/) (1-888-373-7888). They connected me with a lawyer who then helped me get to the FBI report the crimes. Prior to this happening in 2015, I had no idea that labor trafficking was even a real thing. I only knew about sex trafficking.\n\nEven though authorities chose not to do anything about my case, it is nice to have a name for what happened to me.",

It's been an exhausting day and I think it's time to unplug. I'll check in tomorrow just to confirm my continued freedom and breathing.\n\nUPDATE: No black suits yet. Things continue to be crazy. [NYT interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/business/media/fake-presidential-seal-trump.html) today clarified some things.\n\nUPDATE 2: For anyone interested in the store, after multiple phone calls and speaking with PayPal customer service for quite literally hours, I have elected to [disable PayPal as a payment option](https://i.imgur.com/mOUXkNI.jpg) on onetermdonnie.com. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nUPDATE 3: This is just plain surreal. [Blondie playing in D.C. last night](https://i.imgur.com/exNYluj.jpg)",

In that class was one of those guys who has to remind you he served via his clothes. Ya know the type.\n\nOne day we were discussing systems of government starting from the right and going left. Everything was doing great until we hit socialism and then communism. \n\nThis due exploded with \"you're telling me I have to give up the stuff I sweated for so someone else who didn't do anything can have it instead?' and the Prof had to explain that the idea was we give what we can and we all reap part the rewards in a perfect scenario (disregarding corruption, greed, etc). It was just touching on the ideas and fundamentals of a governing system but this guy took it as meaning RIGHT THIS INSTANT THIS WAS HOW WE WOULD BE DOING IT IN THE US.\n\nThe professor stated several times that he was explaining a system of belief in governance, not mandating it but the guy couldn't get past that someone was taking HIS labor and getting it for FREE. Why was he giving his stuff to other people!? For almost twenty minutes this went on with me wondering if I could clock him with my textbook so we could move on before the professor called for a break.\n\nSorry it's kind of a tangent but your comment of college aged Republicans reminded me of it.",

It was a news aggregator/link submiting websit and contemporary competitor to Digg back in the days.  The biggest difference is that on Fark moderators have to approve all the content submissions and there's only a handful of channels and topics you can talk about. It's also tied much closer to the founder Drew Curtis and kinda run more like a small online community than a modern giant platform like reddit.\n\n Imagine reddit but only with like 10 default subs and the mods have all the control.  I feel like Fark and reddit hate eachother, I also feel like reddit doesn't care they are 1000X the size now and frankly many people have complained that Fark has gone down hill. It's one of those weird old web 1.0 day relics.",

People were wondering how they could help memorialize her. We ended up calling our local library and asking if they had a children's book wish list on Amazon. They did so we posted it. Suddenly it was wiped clean as people started donation. They kept having to add books. We also asked people to donate to their local library in our daughter's name. \nSo a few years later I went to the library and was showing one of the children's books with Cassandra's name in it to my other daughter and a librarian heard me talking about it. She came over and was like \"OMG you are Cassandra's mom. We had no idea who she was or why we suddenly got about a hundred books in her name from around the world\".",

He said the website where he displays and sells art had been offline for the past two years.\n\nA version that appeared Tuesday behind President Trump replaced the 13 arrows with 13 golf clubs and used a two-headed eagle from Russia's coat of arms. \n\nDollar bills were substituted for the olive branch traditionally in the other claw.  \n\nTurning Point USA, an activist group for young right wingers, said it fired the young aide responsible for accidentally selecting the mischievous parody. \n\nSince the story broke Thursday Leazott said he had put his shop back online to cash in on interest and sell merch \"\n\n\"The mystery behind how a spoof Presidential seal was used as a backdrop for a Donald Trump speech deepened today as the artist behind the Russian-themed design told DailyMail.com there was \u2018no chance' it was an accident. \n\nTurning Point USA, an activist group for young right wingers, said it fired the young aide responsible for accidentally selecting the mischievous parody - featuring a Russian eagle and golf clubs - in a last minute google search. \n\nBut its creator, Charles Leazott, said it was impossible for someone to have innocently stumbled across his satirical version of the US seal because the website where he displays and sells art had been offline for the past two years. \n\nLeazott, a 46-year-old graphic designer from Richmond, Virginia, told DailyMail.com he had no part in the bizarre turn of events that saw the doctored image beamed on stage in Washington DC Tuesday as Trump spoke. \n\nBut he added, gleefully: \u2018I have zero clue who did it. Although, if I ever find out, I will absolutely buy them a beer. That's awesome.\u2019\n\n\"Leazott, a married father of two who has voted both Republican and Democrat in the past, said he came up with the design back in 2016 after Trump won the election to tease his love of golf and supposed ties to the Kremlin. \n\nInstead of 'E pluribus unum', the U.S. motto that means 'out of many, one' in Latin, the satirical version of the presidential seal - seen by roughly 1,000 teens and a global online audience - sported a new phrase: '45 es un titere.' \n\nThat's Spanish for '45 is a puppet.' And in place of the bald eagle seen on the official version, unchanged since 1960, was a two-headed eagle from the Russian coat of arms, complete with hammer and sickle across its chest and a bag of golf clubs in its claw. \n\nWhen the design proved a hit with his friends, Leazott added it to a website he created to sell anti-Trump memorabilia, entitled 'Onetimedonnie: Dedicated to the cause of ensuring Donald Trump serves no more than one term as the President of the United States.' \"\n\n\"But by the start of 2017, however, he says he stopped maintaining the website and the shop was offline, so if anyone clicked on the domain name all they would see was an empty blog page. \n\nHe had posted the seal to Twitter and Facebook but says you would have had to know it was there then 'clicked and clicked and clicked' to find it. \n\nLeazott's alterations somehow went unnoticed this week as Trump took to the stage and addressed the hundreds of young supporters packed inside the Marriott Marquis in Washington, D.C. \n\nHowever it was soon spotted in the dozens of photos and videos from the event, prompting Turning Point USA chiefs to apologies and insist it was a simple oversight.\"\n\n\"Leazott told DailyMail.com that seemed extremely unlikely. \n\n'My website would technically have existed but it wouldn't have taken you anywhere and the art wasn't on there,' he said. 'You have to remember I'm just a random nobody and why would I come up in the search results. There's a million funny Trump images on google and this is just one more of them. \n\n'You would have had to specifically go seeking this out. So I just don't buy for an minute that this was just an innocent mistake.\n\n\u2018Somebody did this on purpose - I think it's hilarious.\u2019\n\nNeither the White House nor Turning Point USA initially had an explanation for how the modified seal ended up in photos alongside the leader of the free world. \"\n\n\"But by Thursday afternoon the responsible person had gotten his walking papers. A source at Turning Point described the unlucky ex-employee as 'a low level audio-visual grunt'.\n\nThe source had said earlier that the organization was 'chasing down an explanation' for what it saw as an 'embarrassing' moment for a group the White House considers a key ally heading into the 2020 election season. \n\nTurning Point USA also told CNN that it had 'zero malicious intent' behind the imagery. \n\n'We're sorry for the mix-up and meant no disrespect to the White House or the President or the advance team,' the group said. \"\n\n\"A White House aide brushed off a suggestion on Thursday that the president's advance team should have inspected all the visual elements of the stage presentation before Trump arrived. \n\n'This is a Turning Point thing,' the aide said. 'Go ask them.\u2019 \n\nSince the story broke Thursday Leazott said he had put his shop back online to cash in on interest in the spoof seal, with spectacular results. \n\n\u2018I have sold a ludicrous amount of merchandise today,\u2019 he laughed. \u2018Shirts, stickers, basically anything you can print it on.\u2019\n\nYou can visit his store at One Term Donnie.\"\n\nhttps://imgur.com/z3poyZA\n\nhttps://imgur.com/zz8LgaP\n\n[edited for clarity, added images]",

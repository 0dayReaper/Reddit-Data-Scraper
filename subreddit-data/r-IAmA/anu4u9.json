I own the seminal 1983  album Born to Add on vinyl (because vinyl sounds better), and personally think your song Hey Food is the best cut on the album.  Question: why hasn't the Sesame Street cast put out more albums?  Or, if they have (and please don't take offense), what do you feel is the reason the cast creatively peaked, musically, in the early 1980s (Sesame Street Fever is also an excellent album)?\n\nThanks.  Longtime fan.\n",

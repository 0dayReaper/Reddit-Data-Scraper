I've used my background as a [National Homebrew Competition Gold Medalist](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CQbSfwRJaim/), Advanced Cicerone, and WSET Spirits holder to write about drinks and drinking culture for [VinePair](https://vinepair.com/). Everything from [tasting beer like a judge](https://vinepair.com/articles/homebrew-tasting-guide/), to the [Kentucky Derby's favorite mixer](https://vinepair.com/articles/ale-8-soda-bourbon/), and a [quirky new shot](https://vinepair.com/articles/breakfast-shots/). My first book [How to Taste: A Guide to Discovering Flavor and Savoring Life](https://www.how2taste.com/) combines my experiences with those of more than 100 other professional tasters to explore our senses and how flavor makes life better for everyone.

                    "comment": "Interesting! I think when it comes to how flavor science and marketing contrast there are a few truths: flavor comes from flavor active compounds, if a compound isn\u2019t there there is no way you can taste or smell it. However, our minds play many tricks on our palate. Everything from the heft of the bottle to the color of the packaging can impact what we taste. (For example, things taste sweeter in rooms with pink walls than they do in rooms with brown walls.) A good story can also shift what we taste, which is what many marketers rely on. \n\nIn some ways \u201cterroir\u201d in wine could be considered a marketing concept, a romantic story about the wine\u2019s origins and the reason that wine can\u2019t exist anywhere else in the world. Yet at the same time there are provable flavor impacts of terroir not just in wine but in everything from cheese to oysters. One study found that cheese tasters could taste the difference in cheeses made exactly the same way with milk from farms just a few miles apart. \n\nSo a marketing story can\u2019t create flavor, and a product can\u2019t always live up to its marketing\u2026but messaging has more impact on what we taste than you might want to believe!",

If you leave wait grain out in nature you\u2019ll get something close to (though not as tasty as) beer. \n\nTo that point my favorite no-sugar-added, naturally made beverage category is Belgian style ales. They ferment all the way out so there is no residual sugar and unlike wines or ciders beer doesn\u2019t require added sulfates which I know people are wary of. A Belgian Golden Strong will be golden and sparkling with a tone of carbonation, a slight grassy herbal edge from hops and a crisp apple character from signature Belgian yeast. \n\nAnother good category to explore when looking for beverages low on additives are fermented rice drinks. Sake has been on a trend toward organic ingredients and production methods especially brewers following the \u201cpure sake\u201d movement. Makgeolli is a Korean rice wine that\u2019s made with just three ingredients: rice, water and nuruk (a traditional Korean fermentation starter).",

There is anywhere from 5 days to a couple weeks of training where you have to prove again and again that you can smell or taste a substance and identify its chemical components. \n\nI did taster training in beer first which involves tasting many tiny cups of beer spiked with different compounds over and over again to add them to my sensory memory. Then tasting dozens of cups blind and correctly identifying every compound. This is similar to the training QC professionals in the dairy industry undergo, but they\u2019re sipping 40+ samples of milk a day. I think I picked the better specialty.",

    "postText": "EDIT: This AMA is now complete. Thank you to everyone who posted such interesting and thoughtful questions.\n\nHere\u2019s the story for Bloomberg Opinion: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-opinion-arctic-geopolitics-resources/army-training.html?srnd=opinion [Free to read]\n\nFollow my Twitter account for updates on Part Two: https://twitter.com/liamdenning\n\nPROOF: https://i.redd.it/ql8tbpuf1p3b1.jpg\n\nI\u2019m Liam Denning, a columnist with Bloomberg Opinion who spent several days on the ground with the 11th Airborne Division at their winter warfare training facility in Alaska. \n\nThe \u201cArctic warriors\u201d are currently training to ski, shoot and survive in the Arctic. At -35F in 25 mph winds, your face can get frostbite in 4 minutes. That danger, plus sheer emptiness and lack of infrastructure in a state bigger than most countries, makes conventional Arctic warfare\u00a0seem unimaginable.\nSo what are they preparing for up there? Alaska\u00a0was a\u00a0Cold War\u00a0frontline, but became a backwater after 9/11. Now the US has been spooked by Russian and Chinese moves, all given more urgency by the faraway war in\u00a0Ukraine.\n\nI\u2019m writing a series of on-the-ground features about the army hiding at the top of the world, and I just released part one.\n\nI\u2019m here to answer your questions starting Monday June 5 at 12pm ET - ask me anything about my trip!",

Also, do members have satellite phones to track location if they pass out from the cold? \n\nDo you think that Anchorage will become a larger international air transit hub, or a larger military base to defend against Russia and China?

Alaska is about 2.5x the size of Texas and has fewer people than San Francisco and less road mileage than Connecticut. Driving 40 minutes down the Richardson Highway in the early morning, you might see one or two trucks (probably more now that tourist season is starting).\n\nBut that emptiness, while part of Alaska's charm, can also feel pretty bleak when darkness or bad weather set in. Apart from the cold, that exacts a psychological burden on the soldiers posted there. -- LD",

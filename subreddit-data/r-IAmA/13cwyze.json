    "postText": "Hi guys! I am Marco Santanch\u00e9. I built portfolio strategies for Credit Suisse and Neuberger Berman, and I am now the author of a monthly series *Quant Evolution*. Here is my [bio](https://www.hedder.com/fellows/marco-santanche).\n\nAs a practitioner and a quant Geek (with a capital G), I can answer anything about the recent bank failures, investing, and portfolio strategy. Some of the questions that people like to ask me include:\n\n* What are the use cases of AI and machine learning when it comes to investment management?\n* How do institutional players approach portfolio strategy?\n* How should one implement ETF strategies?\n* Why are systematic strategies often wrongly implemented by retail investors?\n* What are my thoughts on the high-profile ETFs (e.g. ARKK)?\n* Why so many bank failures lately?\n\nMy Proof: [https://postimg.cc/62q7TTcz](https://postimg.cc/62q7TTcz)\n\nYou can compare my photo against my LinkedIn, Marco Santanch\u00e9.\n\nEDIT: I didn't expect so many good questions on a topic (quant) that is so niche! Here's a quant [reading list](https://quant.hedder.com/reading-list/) (ranging from basic stuff to advanced materials) that you might find helpful. ",

And it is also true that media and clients sometimes compare apples with oranges (how can a Fixed Income fund outperform the S&amp;P500? It is not uncommon to see investors comparing the two)",

You should never trust someone who is sure about their advice...What I can say is, investments developments are often impossible to forecast with accuracy, especially when unexpected events occur. The best is to keep a portfolio exactly for this reason: I will be wrong picking up one security, but if I pick up a general direction for the future, I might be right. No technical or fundamental reason will truly hold if too specific, and no security deserves 100% of your portfolio, only indices (ETFs) might have a reason for that.",

Once we have the tools, we don't only make our best interest, but also improve the industry as a whole, because these funds won't get the money and they will eventually disappear.  \nAnd once they disappear, winners will be much easier to spot. But the market is inefficient in all its respects, and it will stay like that for a while, so please focus on learning and understanding the investment opportunities proposed to you. And if you find a good one after this process, it means you really understand it.  \n\n\nWe could add a 3): investors are very greedy, and the Sharpe Ratio and drawdown of passive investments is dissatisfying. So, if one finds a (truly) good opportunity, they give it a try. However, greed leads you to make mistakes. Be always careful.",

And of course, diversifying in asset classes. I wouldn't be too heavy on fixed income as volatility is crazy as of today and in general in recent years. But you can also consider alternative asset classes like commodities.  \nInvesting in equities this year might be an opportunity, as I feel they trade at a discount compared to 2021, and the macro trouble might be solved soon.

The only information I have is the one publicly available, nothing internal nor private.  \nI met nobody who worked in that segment, or had business with Bill Hwang. Do they despise him? As you might despise him, because he bet too big, probably people could despise him in the same way. But apart of those reading the news, and everyone with their own personal opinion, I don't know if those around him trusted or despised him.  \n\n\nThe losses were due to bad business. A bet he wasn't able to afford, built in a complex structure that didn't make clear what he was doing and how much he was risking. But as far as I know, this didn't fall to UBS: the episode closed when Archegos shut down, so there is no risk on that from UBS. The actual currently related losses are the reputational damage of the division, so in the sense of redemptions and difficulty to get new subscriptions or assets, and maybe there is still some fine. But that's it, the business is closed and the contracts are worthless.",

It is true that HFs underperform almost always, however, retail investors did not usually have the \"power\" to invest properly. Nowadays this is shifting, and memestocks are a clear example. What Buffett does remains unique, but other institutions are not necessarily that successful, and retail traders are learning more (just look at education, how many MFE and Quant Finance MSs are there...) and have more tools (Interactive Brokers, Robinhood and the likes).  \nAnd also, the industry is quite stagnating in terms of good new ideas. Recent trends like ESG and thematic investments (ARKK) still have a long way before they can prove to be worthy, especially if you compare with passive investments and especially ETFs, now available to retail clients and often more rewarding than sophisticated active investments.",

Moreover, we can always consider credit risk.  \n\n\nDepending on the maturity, you will have a higher or lower sensitivity to interest rates. Thus, if rates rise, the value of currently issues money market funds will decrease, and vice versa.   \nLiquidity is usually not a problem, but still, when you manage large amounts of assets, it must be considered. Liquidity is expressed as how easy it is to find a counterparty to your trades (buy/sell).  \nCredit risk is also not a problem on average, but still, you need to receive your payments and changes in credit scores can affect your investment, depending on the case.  \n\n\nAs for all investments, we need to mention also inflation risk (money markets usually have low returns) and an important hidden cost, often overlooked, is opportunity cost (isn't there any better alternative on the market?)",

My feeling is that UBS is seen as the older brother saving the younger from his mess.  \nMoving on to Archegos: they just didn't meet margin requirements, and did it anyway by eluding controls. This means you always need to be careful when dealing with clients, but CS wasn't careful enough. They surely had a huge weight in what happened to CS this year, at least reputationally, probably much more than with direct financial implications.",

Of course I'm not a software engineer, so probably that kind of heavy-tech work could improve my infrastructure, from efficiency/latency to memory issues and security.  \nI'd like to see an easy and cheap way to store data in a customized database, maybe with point in time data. That would greatly help, as at the moment I have the infrastructure to source APIs and I worked to make it uniform, but if providers change/manipulate data results might be different. And also, I'd like to store data which doesn't come in a database, like some websocket connections, but it needs some time to setup the machine and functions to store it, and design the database properly. In addition to the already complex task of making sure it is robust to changes in the format.",

Risk management is generally complicated, and I think the problem in my company was not particularly different from those in other companies (I even worked in the counterparty risk management division, but what I did was completely uncorrelated with the matter).  \nWhat happened has more to do with controls closer to the two companies. Greensill had some funds with CS, which I wasn't even aware of until the scandal, and those funds were collecting securities from other companies which were left to Greensill to control. And they didn't control, as well as CS didn't contribute to manage the risk.  \nFor Archegos, I think a good resource is here: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=4065946",

Prior to big market moving events, such as tomorrow\u2019s CPI release, how do institutions typically hedge against potential large moves to the downside? The last two trading days have had the lowest volume and tightest range on the indexes in years, and I was expecting to see some risk-off moves that never came. Curious how institutions typically prepare for events like this.\n\n2.) What is your view on how 0DTE options have effected the overall market since their inception? Do you believe them to be a net positive or negative on the market as a whole?\n\nThanks for your time!",

However, when approaching releases, it might already be too late. Also, not all releases have a huge impact, especially if they meet expectations.\n\n2) I believe they are a tool, and as all tools, they might bring benefits and risks. The risk here is that the whole market will dramatically suffer from any crash, and there are many papers about it. The original idea of options was to use them as insurance contracts, but we moved from there already a long time ago. Hopefully we will see some control from regulators to avoid lightspeed crashes.

Or a target date fund, a one-stop fund with a particular retirement date in mind. I lean toward the ETF probably, simpler and has tax advantages.\n\n2) robo-advisor - basically asks you some questions, spits out a balanced portfolio, does some tax optimization every year, charges between 0.25% and 0.5% annually or so ... which the tax optimization might save you.  i.e. rebalance annually, but try to sell stuff when it's down to offset any taxes on things that have capital gains for any reason. \n\n3) registered investment advisor - would typically charge 0.5%, pick ETFs and funds, maybe offer access to alternatives, have a person you can call, see quarterly or annually. Makes sense if you feel more comfortable with someone you can talk to, a good one will talk you down when the market is down 50% and you want to sell everything. There are some directories of financial advisors and lists of top advisors in your area. The DFA advisors are one breed, they build their own low cost, possibly beta-plus indexes.\n\n4) fee only financial advisor / planner - same as 3), but charges by the hour, instead of e.g. 0.5% \n\nHonestly the only reason to have a financial advisor is if you really implicitly trust them, their biggest value add vs. a very passive approach is you can talk to them when the market is scary, they can educate you, you can be open about all your financial goals and worries and they will work with you. They should be walking you through their asset allocation and individual investments and asking you about all your goals and priorities and risk tolerances and expectations for retirement. You should be monitoring their performance vs. an agreed benchmark, monitoring fees vs. market standards, asking questions about anything that deviates from the agreed allocation and strategy, anything that is performing poorly.\n\nYou can always take your statements to another FA and say you're thinking of switching and they will give you a second opinion. \n\nIf they are explaining things clearly, answering questions, doing what they say and not bullshitting, overtrading, overcharging, and you get along with them, no reason to overworry about them screwing you. Just watch carefully and ask questions about anything. If you are worried about them screwing you, it's a problem already. If they are hard to talk to, it's a problem. If they are trading a lot it's a problem. If they are charging high fees, it's a problem. If they are investing in anything weird it's a problem. \n\nUltimately you do have to educate yourself and talk to them frequently and be comfortable with your FA, if you choose to use one.",

Options aren't the reason that shorting received such a bad reputation.  Options are a tool that investors can use to expand their exposure to underlying assets without actually purchasing the shares.  If you own 100 shares of a company that's failing, you'll sell them and realize a net loss.  If you own 100 shares of a company that is failing and begin selling contracts for your 100 shares, you can mitigate that loss.\n\nA contract for the S&amp;P 500 is worth 100 shares (about $41,000 in capital), but the contract itself has an intrinsic value of about $180 - $220.  Instead of risking $41,000 of capital on a trade, I can have that same exposure for a fraction of the price, and the ability to hedge my position to help soften any negative moment in my trade.  Why submit a limit order on an asset when you can just open a Cash Secured Put at the strike that you'd like to purchase?  If the underlying drops to your strike, you get your shares like you wanted in the first place.  If the underlying doesn't drop, you get paid for the contract as it slowly fades away to time decay.\n\nGot 100 shares of an asset you want to sell?  Sell a Covered Call contract at the strike you'd like to sell at.  Did the asset ever reach your target price?  Yes?  Good, your contract is assigned and you get your money.  No?  Good, your contract expired worthless and you keep the original credit given to you when the contract was sold along with your 100 shares.",

The point here is that rational use of derivatives allows different risks to be split and allocated to the investors who are best equipped to analyze and hold those risks.\n\nFor example, consider interest rate swaps. These instruments allow big banks to offload interest rate risk onto market makers who focus on diversifying and hedging this risk. That way, the banks can focus on their core business, which is originating loans.\n\nOf course, this only works if people are smart. If banks neglect to use the tools that are provided to them, you can end up with a situation like SVB where rising interest rates ate up their assets.\n\nOptions are similar. An option allows you to focus on making a directional bet and let someone else worry about hedging volatility. However, by design, options are also a leveraged instrument; this wipes out a lot of retail investors who aren't aware of the risks of borrowing.",

And the one selling is either doing it because they don't believe in the company, or (in case of a market maker) because they just do business like that, buying and selling stuff to clients (simplified).  \n\n\nIf someone wants to bet and borrow something to sell it (this is eventually short selling), we can't avoid that. People do the most riddiculous things, even betting on horses.  \n\n\nBy the way, options were born to hedge, so in some sense we could say that the tool made sense, even if we look at it from a theoretical perspective (it's an insurance, price goes down I get refunded, and it is not a case that the price is named \"premium\"). Short selling options could be seen as a bet like short selling, I agree. There are interesting books and discussions about it, you should definitely read something from Laurent Bernut.",

As a retail trader who likes to play with data, one should definitely test multiple asset allocation models and generally speaking for longer term horizons. HFT is for those who really study market microstructure.  \nSystematic strategies: retail often have misconceptions about systematic strategies. An example is technical analysis, it might work in your setup and with some rules, but it is usually unsustainable over the long run. It's not completely useless, but it can't be the basis of your strategy, especially if you think many are using it.

It's all based on the direction of the businesses in that area and the expectations I have for the future, so no true financial and market analysis. Before investing you should always carefully research the company and general economic/social background.  \n1) Tech -&gt; I know, it's no news, I like the sector and I believe it is very hard to pick winners as things might change dramatically or unexpectedly (COVID). However, many developments are contributing positively to the industry as a whole, from AI to VR, IoT, blockchain, cloud computing and quantum computing. In general, the long term trend is positive and I don't see why this shouldn't continue.  \n2) Renewable Energy -&gt; it is not only a growing sector, but also ethical and supported by many big players in the investment world. It is set for skyrocketing. Many countries are investing heavily to increase their share in produced and consumed energy from renewable sources. And EM have many good natural resources (just think of Africa's solar power potential, for example), which will definitely be exploited by DM with offshore implants as well.  \n3) Electric vehicles. They disrupted an industry which was not only saturated, but also hard to penetrate (and Tesla made it). Now EVs are like the iPhone, everyone wants one, a status symbol. And currently they need to massively improve in their waste management and production costs (including environmental factors). I believe they will continue to be in a positive trend for some time.",

However, this is not really the point.  \n\n\nI believe the most important skills to learn are practical. Get your hands dirty playing with data, building nice codes and samples of work, understanding the concepts. Of course you probably have to fill some gaps in finance but that's even easier than the math you see in CS. If you really want, just start from blog posts on whatever strategy/portfolio optimization/analysis and try to understand it. If you don't, split the pieces you don't get into smaller ones, until you get to the point that you know what you need to learn.  \n\n\nAlso, please don't invest. Do that only once you understand very well what you are doing in all respects. The initial knowledge is a mix of law, math/stats and business. After that, you might have a grasp on the basics, but in practice they don't work. You surely need to go deeper and deeper over time, so go step by step.",

Having skin in the game is hugely beneficial. Most of trading / investing is managing risk and or emotions. Hard to feel an emotion if you lose 20% of your pretend practice account. Get into Python / Machine Learning / AI as well as this is just starting and the demand for people who know what they are doing in this field will make a killing.",

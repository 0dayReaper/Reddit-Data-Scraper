It's like rolling two dice, and when you roll them they always match. How is that possible without cheating? Entanglement is like there's some cheating going on to correlate the outcomes. To combat the chance that that's happening, scientists separate the entangled particles by long distances so that the cheating would have to happen faster than the speed of light (which isn't possible). Entanglement is a joint property -- a property of a system that contains at least two objects. It's only when you make a measurement on one object or the other that you collapse this jointness to properties of the individual objects. The individual objects aren't 1 or 0 or up or down before you make the measurement. Weirder still is that in some sense you can't say which of the two sides actually made the measurement! But after many repeated measurements at either end, the non-classical correlations survive.",

The fact that actual experiments give results that cannot happen if things are predetermined means that the individual objects are not a 1 or 0 or up or down before you make the measurement. We want to assume that when you make a measurement in quantum physics and get a result, that the object had that value before you made the measurements. Again and again, quantum measurement results tell us that's not the case. My son implemented an idea from Howard Wiseman in an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=practiceworkspace.quantumbuttonsbetav01&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US) that tries to get some of the intuition behind this across.",

Weirdly, I'm pretty sure that you could even have the spin of B entangled with the momentum of B, although I'm not sure how to actually accomplish this.\n\nBasically, all of these quantities are described by a wave-function, and the entanglement arises by looking at the combined wave-function of the two subsystems.  If you manage to make the wave-function of the combined system satisfy some constraints, then you can say that the two sub-systems are entangled.",

They check if they're spinning the same way.\n\nNot quite the same way - they spin in the exact opposite direction from one another. If one is measured at 47.34824 degrees and found to be spinning up, the other measured at that same exact angle is 100% expected to be spinning down. This allows the \u201ctotal spin\u201d of the system to equal zero.\n\nThe weirdness comes into play given:\n\nWe know that measurement 100% perturbs the system. Via the laws of classical physics, one member of the pair cannot \u201cknow\u201d the measurement of the other member via faster than light communication. Yet the other member behaves as if it \u201cknows\u201c what happened to the other member, locality be damned, and displays the exact opposite result.\n\nThis suggests that quantum entanglement isn\u2019t bound by the laws of space and time that describes the behavior of objects in the classical universe, and that quantum correlations occur at a deeper level of reality than one described by a four-dimensional spacetime.",

It implies that every particular interaction in the universe is causing change in this manner does it not?\n\nFrom my understanding this is more or less correct. You just always have to remember that to measure something, there must be a medium. To scale it up to the \"humans observing\" idea, that medium is probably light. Which are photons. Those photons at one point interacted with the object you're looking at, which imparted or took some amount of energy on that object, changing it. Without photons as a medium, we could be unable to observe it and would be \"in the dark\" as it were.",

So observed is more to do with how we intend to observe it, that is, the mechanism, more than it has to do with actual observation by a person.\n\nWe tend to think observation is a passive thing.  If I see you, then nothing got \"disturbed\".  But in actuality, light has to bounce off you and into my eyes.\n\nIn other words, whatever technique you use to \"observe\" and usually this means to determine some information will necessarily disturb what's being observed.  A famous example is a two-slit experiment which creates a fringing pattern.  This pattern can be understood using waves (interference).\n\nIf you slow down the light to like one photon per unit time, it still creates this pattern.  If you attempt to add detectors to determine which of the two slits the photon went through, the fringe pattern disappears.  It's the mechanism of detecting what happened, not the observer, that matters most.",

Let's say you have a simple 'pure' quantum state like the cat being dead or alive and you turn a light on to check. The system then feels the photons and electromagnetic fields produced by turning on the light. This is enough to destroy the quantum superposition(decoherence) and the system picks a state(wavefunction collapse). This is generally why we don't have macroscopic quantum effects-- there's too many stray fields and such to keep a quantum system isolated.",

Famously, we have results such as Bell's theorem and the Kochen-Specker theorem, which tell us that a hidden variable model must be non-local and contextual, respectively. Non-locality would mean the ability for information to travel faster than light, and contextuality refers to the fact that the values for the hidden variables must depend on the context in which they're measured (think of measuring something with a ruler, then measuring the same thing turned sideways and getting a different result).",

Really, it's been quantum, but now it will become more and more quantum as the sizes continue to shrink.\n\nJS: The fact that we have transistors, which are the basic ingredients of chipsets, was already quantum mechanical. But electrical engineers at this point can basically forget the microscopic understanding. As chips shrink, the barriers to control electrons become weaker partly because of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Material scientists can still change the materials of these barriers to make some progress, keeping Moore's Law alive for a little bit longer. However, we are likely not far from where these tunnel barriers cannot be shrunk further. It's not like transistors will become quantum mechanical at that point, so rethinking the quantum mechanics of transistors may be the path to reducing chip sizes further. But the path here is far from clear.",

Since both the cats and the room will evolve identically in the absence of any outside interaction, one cat will be the future of another cat as long as the cats are not observed. When you observe them at the end of the experiment, they will collapse in the same state IF they started out in any of the \u201cspecial\u201d states (eigenstates). If they started out in a general quantum state the final outcomes can differ. In that case, you ne cat will not be the future of the other cat.\n\nCase 2: Rooms and cats are identical but the room interacts with outside environment. The room and cat will loose coherence in different ways and there is negligible chance of your brother being right.\n\nCase 3: If cats are different, they stay different.\n\nOPs might want to comment or correct my answer.",

The quantum mechanical theory of light tells us that the vacuum is filled with so-called virtual photons, popping in and out with energies that are higher and higher at shorter and shorter wavelengths. When this is combined with Einstein's general theory of relativity (if we were to naively combine with QM), this suggests that the gravitational pull from these virtual photons would be strong enough to trap the photon as if it were in a black hole (the Schwarzchild radius for the experts). This is clearly nonsense.\n\nAM: Or as Han Solo would say, \"I have a bad feeling about this.\"\n\nJS: What this means is that we do not have a consistent way of combining Einstein's general theory of relativity with quantum mechanics. This does not effect physics in the quantum world, which is small enough to evade the effects of gravity. This reflects in the fact that the Planck length is 10^(-35) m, many orders of magnitude smaller than any length scale we access. For reference, the size of a nucleus of an atom is 10^(-18) m, which is a billion billion times larger than the Planck length. So while we do not know what happens below the Planck length, we are very far from encountering this physics in real life.\n\nAM: Of course, any time a physicist says it's impossible to do X, there's significant potential for embarrassment in the future.",

That paper has not yet been peer reviewed yet but we have no reason to doubt the work. \n\nJS: To be clear, they did not entangle two tardigrades but one tardigrade with superconducting qubits. In fact, a superconducting qubit itself is several microns in size, which is actually bigger than the tardigrade. Despite this, superconducting qubits have been entangled and generally been key participants in quantum computers. This is because the key challenge of entanglement is to entangle and verify entanglement for a large number of degrees of freedom (example: ways it can move or vibrate). A superconducting qubit at milikelvin temperatures, despite being macroscopic has very few degrees of freedom. A tardigrade at ten milikelvin might also have very few degrees of freedom. It is impressive that it comes back to life after that though.\n\nAM: And there is a lot of effort directed at non-tardigrade macroscopic entanglement.",

You can imagine a vector that \"acts like angular momentum\" for each particle. Typically, magnetism results when all of these spins align in a direction. When you bring a ferromagnetic material close to to another material, the other material feels the magnetic field of the ferromagnet, and the spins (often) want to align with that magnetic field. There is energy saved being in that state, so you can think of taking these ferromagnets apart should cost you some energy to undo - you feel like you have to apply a force to separate them. Or, on other ends, two ferromagnets where spins are pointing in opposite directions have a higher energy state if they are closer to each other, so you have to apply force to bring them closer to each other.",

As a weird explanation by means of an analogy, a hypothetical conversation might go like this:\n\nPerson A: What are we made of?\n\nPerson B: Cells.\n\nPerson A: What are cells made of?\n\nPerson B: Molecules.\n\nPerson A: What are molecules made of?\n\nPerson B: Atoms.\n\nPerson A: What are atoms made of?\n\nPerson B: Protons, neutrons, and electrons.\n\nPerson A: What are protons and neutrons made of?\n\nPerson B: Quarks\n\nPerson A: What are quarks made of?\n\nPerson B: Nothing we know about yet. They are known as  ***elementary particles*** and cannot be subdivided any further.\n\nThe point of this analogous example is that at some level of any hierarchy, our current understanding of a given thing is the most basic form of \"being\" that we know about. In the case of magnetism, a ***spin magnetic moment*** is essentially one of those things. It's a basic law of nature, and can only be explained mathematically, not in any conventional conceptual sense that we can wrap our heads around on a superficial level.\n\nSo long story short, I don't think it's possible to answer your query in a way that will feel satisfying. But I get what you're asking, because my brain tries to understand things conceptually in the same ELI5 sense.",

In that sense, you can think of a particle as a fairly localized collection of ripples in the different fields that permeate spacetime.",

Superposition: From what I\u2019ve gathered, a particle is in a supposition before it is measured, meaning it exists in all possible states predicted by its wave function before it collapses. My questions are, are all unmeasured quantum systems in superposition before they are measured and how exactly does superposition manifest in the physical world? Is the particle *really* in multiple places or velocities at once, is it simply a consequence of the wave function, or we just don\u2019t know? I guess the double slit experiment answers this question, but I\u2019d like y\u2019all\u2019s interpretation. \n\n2. The Measurement Problem. Will we ever truly solve the measurement problem? I understand that The Copenhagen Interpretation is the most widely accepted theory, but I\u2019d like to believe Everett was correct and there\u2019s one universal wave function and an infinite number of universes. What do y\u2019all think is the most probable answer, and what are the implications of Many Worlds, say, on future technology. Do you think we\u2019ll ever be able to communicate with other universes if Everett was correct?\n\n3. Entanglement. We\u2019ve proven that Bell was correct and \u201clocal hidden variables\u201d do not exist. My question concerning entanglement is how we actually measure spin and how the filtering works; are they akin to polarized sunglasses or something to that effect?\n\nThanks again for doing this!",

There are modern measurements on neutron spins that use the same type of projective measurements using magnetic field gradients. \n\nNS: And with cold atoms, one can use carefully tuned lasers to detect individual spin states. \n\nAK: For 1. In practice, very few things are in superposition. The surroundings tend to make accidental 'measurements' of the system that collapse the superposition. The hard part with quantum computing is keeping the superposition safe from the surroundings. \n\nNS: But if a particle is in a superposition, say of going with this velocity and that velocity, it actually is doing both. This may betray my allegiance to some particular interpretation, but if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck it probably is a duck. All possible measurements agree with this explanation.",

Oftentimes the quantum computer is benchmarked against the performance of a classical computer running a hastily designed algorithm to solve a new problem. Given a new problem, computer scientists often take a significant amount of time to come up with a fast algorithm to solve that problem. The risk of a quantum supremacy benchmark is that the benchmark might be overturned a few years following the achievement when a smart computer scientist finds a way to solve that problem faster.  This problem is less likely to arise if the problems chosen for quantum supremacy were more traditional, useful problems which had been attempted on a classical computer before, such as factoring, search or optimization.",

Einstein's explanation of that effect was a foundational step in quantum physics. In the late 1930's, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen published a paper that described a hypothetical experiment of detecting what we now call entangled particles. Einstein found the results that quantum mechanics predicted for such an experiment to be unacceptable. In fact, Einstein's analysis of what quantum mechanics predicted was accurate as shown in the experiments that got the 2022 Nobel prize. It's taken a long time to do the foundational experiments and Einstein wasn't wrong about his analysis he just found quantum mechanics philosophically objectionable.",

Quantum information is a field that covers many things. Information? That's the entire universe!  There's also the idea of quantum adjacent fields or quantum aware fields that will be critical to making quantum computers work. Single photon detectors are basically used in cell phones to measure distances when focusing a camera in low-light levels. It's also used for an automatic soap dish dispensers.\n\nJS: Quantum mechanics is only a small part of the expertise that goes into quantum computing as an industry. So someone can participate in the quantum industry even understanding very little of quantum mechanics. For example, microwave circuitry and optics are critical components of quantum computers. Basically, quantum mechanics, which is the science behind quantum computing, is already finding its applications in many places, and will continue to find new applications.\n\nAM: So, if you study any of these fields that feed into quantum computing, you won't be affected too much depending on how quantum computing turns out. You get into physics because the whole universe is something to try and explain, and you can do anything physics.",

It obeys different rules, but it is well understood and controllable. \n\nCC: One example that occurs to me is quantum cryptography. Many seem to think that this involves the use of a magical quantum technique for sending messages. In fact, it's a way of using quantum mechanics for two individuals to obtain the same cryptographic key that can be used to encode/decode messages.

When two particles are entangled, the properties of each particle are not determined until a measurement is made on one of the particles. However, once a measurement is made on one particle, the state of the other particle is immediately determined, regardless of the distance between the particles.\n\nSo before the measurement, they are entangled in a superposition, and after the measurement they are not. They will be in a definite state that correlates with each other. And that state is determined at the measuring moment, there aren't any hidden variables that could've held the information of what their state ends up being.\n\nLet's take gloves as an example. If the entanglement is like having a pair of gloves, you put the gloves in their own boxes and you send one of them far away, and when you open one of the boxes and discover right hand glove, you instantly know that the other one was for left hand. This is not the case for entanglement, their state is determined when they are measured, not before, like the gloves.\n\nBut when you measure the particle you will get seemingly random results. They will be 50% one way and 50% the other. Only after you compare with what the other particle ended up being you find correlation. But that requires information transmission the normal way, at speed of light. So you can't transfer information faster than light, it will just appear to be random, but it will end up correlating with the other side.",

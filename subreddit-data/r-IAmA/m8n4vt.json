    "postText": "I\u2019m excited to be here for my 9th AMA.\n\nSince my last AMA, I\u2019ve written a book called [How to Avoid a Climate Disaster](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/My-new-climate-book-is-finally-here?WT.mc_id=20210319110000_HTAACD_BG-RE_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGRE). There\u2019s been exciting progress in the more than 15 years that I\u2019ve been learning about energy and climate change. What we need now is a plan that turns all this momentum into practical steps to achieve our big goals.\n\nMy book lays out exactly what that plan could look like. I\u2019ve also created an organization called [Breakthrough Energy](https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/?WT.mc_id=20210319110000_HTAACD_BG-RE_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGRE) to accelerate innovation at every step and push for policies that will speed up the clean energy transition. If you want to help, there are [ways everyone can get involved](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/What-you-can-do-to-fight-climate-change?WT.mc_id=20210319110000_HTAACD_BG-RE_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGRE).\n\nWhen I wasn\u2019t working on my book, I spent a lot time over the last year working with my colleagues at the [Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/our-story) and around the world on [ways to stop COVID-19](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/coronavirus-funding-additional-250-million-suzman). The scientific advances made in the last year are stunning, but so far we've fallen short on the vision of equitable access to vaccines for people in low-and middle-income countries. As we start the recovery from COVID-19, we need to take the hard-earned lessons from this tragedy and make sure we're better prepared for the next pandemic.\n\nI\u2019ve already [answered a few questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9dwCfnzQr4) about two really important numbers. You can ask me some more about climate change, COVID-19, or anything else.\n\n**Proof:** [https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1372974769306443784](https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1372974769306443784)\n\n**Update:**  You\u2019ve asked some great questions. Keep them coming. In the meantime, I [have a question for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/m8o6iq/what_makes_you_hopeful_that_we_can_reach_net_zero/).\n\n**Update**: I\u2019m afraid I need to wrap up. Thanks for all the meaty questions! I\u2019ll try to offset them by having an [Impossible burger](https://www.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/m8oq24/i_ate_an_impossible_burger/) for lunch today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I was formerly the CEO of Reddit and now the founder/CEO of [Terraformation](https://www.terraformation.com/blog/trees-are-a-faster-solution-to-climate-change-than-technology).\n\nThis is no longer as big a problem as it used to be, due to ongoing declines in the price of solar.  At prices as low 1.3 cents/kwh, it means that freshwater using solar desalination can be provided for as low as 17 cents per thousand-gallons (TG).  Typical municipal water supplies in the US average around $1.50 per TG.\n\nPreviously, desalination was limited by the fact that it required expensive fossil fuels, leading to excessive emissions.  The declining cost of solar means that the world can now produce arbitrarily large amounts of freshwater via RO desalination extremely economically.  Further, solar desalination isn't subject to the solar intermittency problem*, which means we can leapfrog the transition to solar years ahead of residential/commercial applications because minimal battery storage costs are involved.\n\nFinally, moving water is less expensive than one would expect.  The main cost of moving water has to do with how far you LIFT it, not the horizontal distance (if you lift it, then it flows downwards as far as you want to - we have [aquaduct networks in California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Aqueduct) that do this).  Lifting water by pumping is also not subject to solar intermittency - you run the pump during the day when the sun is out, and store it in intermediate tanks - and so it benefits from the low cost of solar just like desalination.\n\nCompare this to the plans required to trap captured carbon from direct air capture, which propose to build an enormous pipeline network to transport this captured carbon into rock formations - a [mind-boggling undertaking, involving the construction of 110,000km of new pipelines - an \"interstate CO2 highway system.\"](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/15/race-to-zero-america-emissions-climate-crisis)  If we think it's worthwhile to build a huge network of pipes to transport liquidifed CO2 into rock formations in the middle of the continent (seriously, go click on that link and look at the pipeline network it is contemplating), it would almost certainly be more affordable to build pipelines - or even open aquaducts, similar to ones that already exist in the Western US - to transport mere *water* for similar or smaller distances.\n\nWhat this all means is that the declining cost of solar (on a per-kwh basis, it is now cheaper than the marginal cost of fossil fuels) makes freshwater scarcity a problem that will likely be **completely resolved** in the next 10-20 years, AND provides us with a sufficiently cheap supply of freshwater needed to irrigate otherwise arid land that can now support forest restoration, which is a [safe, inexpensive, and scalable natural carbon capture solution](https://www.terraformation.com/blog/the-solution-isnt-trees-its-trees-plus-math).\n\n\n---\n\n\\* For lay readers: the **solar intermittency problem** refers to the idea that the sun doesn't shine all the time, so if you're trying to use solar for residential/commercial purposes, you need (relatively) expensive batteries to store it in so that you have power at night or on cloudy days.  Solar panels are cheap, but batteries are still pretty expensive - one reason our transition to solar/wind is going so slowly.  With desalination, you don't need to desalinate at night: you just do it during the day when the sun is out, and store the freshwater in tanks (so if you need water at night, it's there) - and tanks are a hell of a lot cheaper than batteries!\n\n---\n\nEDIT:\nOne commonly-cited concern about desalination is the effluent (brine) that it produces. It turns out that this isn't as big a problem as commonly believed.\n\nFirst, especially in the case of desalinating water for agricultural purposes, the brine you're discharging back into the ocean doesn't contain anything that wasn't there in the first place: you're taking salty water from the ocean, pulling some of the freshwater out, and putting what remains back.  Chemical treatments to the water are actually done in the *freshwater* after it's been filtered out in order to make it potable for human use (e.g. chlorine, magnesium, etc), but that's not done with the *discharge* - the discharge is just \"ocean water that we didn't want.\"  \n\nPractically speaking, there are a few ways of disposal, depending on your local conditions.  The one thing you *don't* want to do is dump it just off the shoreline, because the increased salinity *can* be harmful to near-shore marine life.  However, other solutions include:\n\n- If you are taking water from a near-shore brackish well, you also drill a disposal well all the way down to the water table, and both wells replenish quickly enough such that salty water injected deep underground doesn't hurt anything (it goes into the rocks).  This method has been used successfully by other solar desalination farms that aren't using water directly from the ocean.\n- In some cases, you can use it to water salt-tolerant plants, and essentially double the forest cover you're able to irrigate per gallon.  This is highly dependent on local species.  We do this at our pilot facility in Hawaii.\n- You build a long pipe out into the ocean (e.g. 2km) and dispose it much further out where the ocean is capable of diluting the salty water and marine life is much sparser.  Israel does this.  I consider this the most scalable solution, mostly because we (humans) are great at building long pipes - we build them to carry oil, so we can certainly do it for salty water.\n\nIsrael did [extensive studies](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/10/2/197/htm) of the waters off their coasts precisely to evaluate the environmental impacts of discharge because they were concerned about this; from the study:\n\n&gt; \"Ultimately, the ecological damage caused by brines and desalination chemicals discharged into the Mediterranean appears to be extremely local in its dimensions and modest in magnitude. Moreover, the marine pollution experts at the Ministry of Environmental Protection observe that desalination actually cleans massive quantities of seawater, which it then releases, so some of the impact from brine discharges may not be negative at all.\"\n\n(One other thing they observed when trying to determine \"pollution impacts\" was that a far larger problem was *other sewage discharge* into the nearby water, which would foul the seawater intakes for desalination; as far \"things we're dumping into the sea,\" extra-salty water that we originally got from the sea itself is apparently not a major problem)\n\nFinally, the perfection of affordable *forward*-osmosis processes will allow us to so significantly reduce effluent volumes (raising freshwater yield from ~50% to 98%+) to the point where the brine is so concentrated that it can be centrifuged into a salt \"puck\" with usable commercial applications.  There's already a pilot plant in California's Central Valley that does this and the technology exists; it just needs to be made cheap enough.",

The super heated part comes from certain sources that are renewable. The speration comes from the steaming action in the heat exchanger, and a ventuir to cool the steam to water. It's a mobile system platform that can be moved via barge. \n\nLet me know if you'd like to know more I've been looking for finding for a while but with out a prototype it's tough. \n\nI worked on the super heated part with a prototype that was successful.",

How are you able to focus and absorb so much information, especially when (I assume) the main purpose of these trips isn't usually reading?\n\nIs there a specific note-taking strategy you use? What exactly do you write as you're taking notes?\n\nI've been trying to read more during the pandemic and sort of succeeding, but at times I find myself looking at words and not absorbing their content. This is partially due to ADHD, but I think learning to take notes will help.\n\nThank you!",

If it's a small reactor it's relatively easy to keep that cool, but if it's a huge beast of a thing you need more serious cooling mechanisms (think cube square law). That was a huge issue at Fukushima. It's been a known issue for a long time, but it's not easily solved.\n\nThat and similar issues ended up taking what was a relatively simple design at small scale, and making it into an absolute beast of a design at large scale.",

It's important to learn all you can, and to keep an eye on continually improving your abilities (it's not far off to say programming is a craft, and like any craft you have to keep at it), but passion is the single biggest indicator I've seen for if a entry level or jr engineer is worth taking a risk on. The more excited someone gets about their work and about code and building good systems the more likely they are to learn quickly, learn a lot, and just be *hungry* to grow their skills.\n\nBut most of all: don't get discouraged. You'll meet a lot of people smarter and better skilled than you, and while that curve may taper off later in your career it won't ever go away. There will always be a little voice whispering to you \"You don't belong here, they'll figure it out soon, and you'll be fired. Quit now and just give up.\"\n\nThat voice is your enemy, and it *lies*: ignore it, and keep honing your abilities.",

AbleDOS was the result of a collaboration with the Trace Research &amp; Development Center and introduced a number of the features in the Windows today. Latch Keys, Sticky Keys, Mouse Keys. With Window95 and more so with Windows 2000, there was more of a focus on providing access to an offscreen model for screen readers, Windows XP and Vista more support for single switch devices for input.  Programs that use the common controls in the OS are generally able to ride on the improvements as the OS continues to mature. \n\nThis might have changed, since I left, but programs like the Office Suite have had to build accessibility in to since they don\u2019t use the OS common controls for things like their off-screen model and file pickers. But they seem to be making progress. \n\nBillG won\u2019t read this comment I\u2019m sure, but efforts for accessibility really picked up steam with the challenged rollout of Internet Explorer 3.02 and how the .02 release \u2013 in part \u2013 was required to add back in the frame work ActiveAccessibiltiy so the browser met the accessibility needs of the US Gov. so IE could be used (vs. being locked out for not being accessible). \n\nOnce that rollout was done a Senior Vice President was tasked with accessibility for the first time. Back then where were only about fifteen VPs in the company, and to get an SVP to have it was pretty cool. Over time executive sponsorship bounces between different VPs and the most impactful times for accessibility in the company when the VP had a family member who benefited from accessibility efforts. Things took a big shift funding wise when Sayta became CEO and he funded the current structure in place that /u/jenmsft points at. \n\nEven prior to Sayta\u2019s sponsorship, there were a reasonable number of groups that explored improvements. Loads of them never saw the light of day when they didn\u2019t test out to be as useful as it might seem they would be. Others, like the 'Inverted' pointers have been in Windows going back to Windows 2000 and at a smaller scope allow the mouse pointer to stand out regardless of the color of the background (well gray is hard to invert but...) have been helpful when people are giving PowerPoint-style presentations and want the mouse pointer to be easy to see on screen. The Color Filters are way more advanced and address much more than just the on screen pointer. Really great to see close 30 years after the introduction of AbleDOS that the company is continuing to make things better.",

I help finance electric heat pumps in low cost housing to replace natural gas.\n\nI plan to fly a lot less now that the pandemic has shown we can get by with less trips.",

Population will peak around 10B if we are generous to the poorest countries particularly in Africa. Africa faces climate problems and population growth so having enough food and education and stability is a huge challenge. It was looking at African agriculture and how the climate is making it less productive that got me to study climate.\n\nSo we should help moderate population growth with aid for health, education and good governance.

But after their announcement that they would make the vaccine free to produce, they received immense pressure from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (wherein Oxford research staff were threatened with the reduction or elimination of all grants from the Foundation, not limited only to those for medical research) to patent the vaccine and partner with AstraZeneca to sell it.  So, now, not only did AstraZeneca receive all the accolades for \"developing\" a vaccine (which the company did not do), it's also being produced in limited quantities and sold for $4 per dose to the federal government, which is about 20 times more expensive than the estimated cost if the formula had been open source and allowed to be mass produced by any manufacturer with the required equipment.  In addition, because it is patented, it can only be produced by AstraZeneca, and poor countries have no or limited access to inexpensive vaccines. \n\nWhy did you do that, Bill?",

So the country can make their own generics for cheap and pay for them on their own or they can honor the patents, pay high prices that the Gates Foundation will subsidize.\n\nIts a backdoor way for Gates to spread a culture of strong patent laws on the back of charitable enterprise instead of the normal diplomatic mechanisms.   Microsoft has an interest in strong patent laws because software patents are basically a house of cards, the more there is a culture of just honoring all patents the less software patents will come under scrutiny.\n\nHere is a [WSJ article from 2002](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1021577629748680000) in which some countries expressed that they felt pressure to comply,  the Gates Foundation spokesman gives a non-denial denial.",

We sent funds to Serum and others early in the pandemic because of the lead time for factories including regulatory review to make sure the factory is high quality.\n\nThis vaccine is inexpensive - around $3 to $2 once you get into high high volume but there are fixed costs to get going.",

Clearly, other pharma companies like Moderna, Bayer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, *et al* have the equipment and ability to mass produce the Oxford vaccine with tight quality control standards and sell them at cost.  It would have been a win-win for the Foundation to support the cause, for the companies producing the vaccine as a public service, and it would have allowed doses to make their way to underserved countries at very low cost.  \n\nSo why limit its production to only AstraZeneca?  Isn't that exactly the opposite of a charitable organization's core goal?",

            "comment": " Hi Mr. Gates,\n\nI am a 16 year old at Wilson HS in Long Beach, California.  My passion is education and I know that many students can share this desire, but it is hidden beneath distractions and social norms for so many people around the world.  My school has a majority low-income and 81% minority enrollment and we have been doing remote learning since a year from this date.  During this time, I decided to start a non-profit online platform that focuses on increasing the motivation and confidence that students have for education, keeping in mind the fact that students learn differently even among similar areas, cultures, and backgrounds.  My goal with the platform is to be a place where students create their own instructional videos, which solidifies their learning and gives them motivation associated with the satisfaction that comes with creating the end-product of a video.  The result is that students learn from teaching, also known as the protege effect, and gain opportunities to practice their presentation and technical skills in a world that embraces video presentation skills.  On the platform, students can also learn from each other by interacting with the videos of their peers from around the world.  I know that it is an ambitious and not mainstream concept to have students teach and make videos, but after personal experience and research that backs it up, I have conviction that this can improve motivation and outcomes for all students.  To help foster the growth of this concept, and to make it mainstream, I plan to raise funds to hold quarterly scholarship competitions to encourage more participation in this opportunity throughout the world.  What advice can you give me about my mission to introduce this idea to the mainstream of education?",

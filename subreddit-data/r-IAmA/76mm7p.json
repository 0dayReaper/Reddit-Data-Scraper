    "postText": "***Update*** I am logging off! Thank you so much for all the great questions! I can tell by the questions that many people here care about the North Korean people and know that they are different from the regime. I wish I had more time to answer more questions but it is my last night in America before going back to South Korea and I want to eat some great NYC food! I will try to answer some questions later tonight if I have some time :) \n\n***Annyeonghaseyo!*** \n\nMy name is Joy and I\u2019m from North Korea. I escaped to China when I was 18 but was immediately trafficked and sold as a bride to a Chinese man for $3,000 USD. Life was difficult, but I gave birth to a daughter who became the joy of my life. After 2 years I was offered an opportunity to finally escape. I reached freedom through a 3,000-mile rescue route that brought me to Southeast Asia, and from there I flew to South Korea. Because the journey out of China is incredibly dangerous for North Koreans, I had to leave my daughter behind. I now live in South Korea and I am studying social work to help North Korean women who have also been trafficked. I hope to bring my daughter to South Korea to live with me one day. \n\nBecause I have family in North Korea that could face punishment if my identity was revealed, I cannot share my real name or show my face. \n\nProof: \n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BaRjpH9hh8v/?taken-by=libertyinnorthkorea)\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/libertyinnk/photos/a.346395102750.163229.128289862750/10154839768572751/?type=3&amp;theater)\n[Blog](https://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/joys-story-part-1-growing-north-korea/) \n\nI am joined today by Ian and Sarah of Liberty in North Korea (LiNK). Together, we are in NYC promoting LiNK\u2019s new film [Sleep Well, My Baby](https://www.sleepwellmybaby.com/). It is a short film about a North Korean woman who was trafficked and sold in China, and it is based on the real stories of North Korean women like myself. I\u2019m still learning English, so Sarah will be translating for me and Ian will be typing.\n\n[Liberty in North Korea](https://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/) is an international NGO dedicated to supporting the North Korean people. LiNK brings North Korean refugees through a 3,000-mile, modern-day 'underground railroad' to freedom and safety. To date they have rescued more than 700 North Korean refugees. These refugees drive change inside the country by sending money and outside information back to friends and family. LiNK also works to change the narrative on North Korea by producing documentaries, hosting events, and engaging with the international media to bring more focus to the North Korean people and the bottom-up changes they are driving in their country. The vision of LiNK is a free North Korea in our lifetimes. \n\nOk enough background. Let\u2019s get started - please ask me anything! \n",

Did your family help, and if not, how did you plan it as an 18-year-old with restricted contact with the outside world? \n\nYou are incredibly brave and your work now to become a social worker shows your nobility and goodness as well. I wish you and your daughter the best ",

I heard rumors that I could escape to China and be adopted by an older Chinese couple and live a happy life there. My step-mother knew a broker who convinced me to go to China. \n\nThe broker guided me to the Tumen river and told me when and where to cross. When I was picked up on the other side the broker told me to pay for my escape or be sold as a bride. I had no money and was terrified of being arrested by the Chinese police. I felt so trapped. ",

It's a popular dish in South Korea, and it's often awesome to have during the summer when it's hot. \n\nThe way I've usually eaten it is buckwheat noodles in cold beef broth, some ice cubes, sliced ringo pears, quick pickled cucumber, quick pickled white radish, sliced beef, vinegar, and hard boiled egg. The soup can be seasoned with a little yellow mustard and vinegar. Served best with a side of kimchi on the side, and tastes great with some Korean BBQ as well. ",

It just seems daunting because the symbols are so different from the roman alphabet, but they're actually pretty similar. Each letter has a unique sound just like the English alphabet; all you need to do is learn them and the structure of the words. The Korean alphabet was created by a really smart guy who wanted to make it easy for commoners to learn to read and write. He even designed the letters based on the form of the mouth and tongue when speaking, so the sounds match the letters visually. ",

I don't agree with it, but I understand why things are how they are right now, as much as it sucks. ",

Younger generations feel much differently since schools don\u2019t pour propaganda-like teachings they did until 1990s. \nNot about empathy, it\u2019s prejudice.\n\nEdit: my North Korean grandmother was forcefully separated from her 5 sisters and parents during Korean war while running on foot to Busan (one of the southern most city of SK), talks about wanting to meet at least one of her family members before she passes away. It definitely keeps future generations like us to have emotionally complicated view on the subject of NK and SKs relationship. Not everyone, but some of us whos extended family is still there. Apparently I have cousins from my grandpas first marriage, some around my age now. I wonder if I\u2019ll ever meet them.\nWanted to share a bit random, but sad reality. ",

They usually go back to NK for whatever reason (spies, didn't want to stay, missed family, etc) or somewhere else for other oppurtunities.\n\n2. Cultural reasons (anti-NK mindset) or just don't want to deal with all that comes with hiring a NK person.\n\n3. Not wanting to put the effort and gamble into seeing if the person is even capable of doing the job. Maybe the culture clash would be too much for them or maybe they just don't have the skillset.\n\n4. Don't forget that there are plenty, plenty, of SK people that are also applying for the job. So businesses are like... why take a chance with NK person when there are SK people that needs jobs as well?\n\n---\n\nWith all that said, for me personally, I think only concern I'd have is giving NK refugees any jobs in the government or military. I don't think we're there yet. Whether we like it or not spies are a real threat in South Korea and North Korea had demonstrated before that they're willing to go pretty far to do what they want to do and get what they want.",

I lived in South Korea for a while, and when I would talk to the locals, they all held an opinion not of disdain for North Korea, but more like regret.  They seem to all wish very much for a peaceful reunification of the two nations.\n\nMy question is this: all the news of North Korea is almost inconceivably dreadful.  While I'm sure there is much misery in the country, can you tell us a story of a time when you or your family were genuinely happy?  What sort of things bring joy to the average North Korean?",

There is rarely any stories about average North Koreans, especially those that live outside the capital Pyongyang. Most North Koreans are ordinary people that want to live peaceful lives but the media makes it look like every North Korean wants to destroy America or South Korea. \n\nEverything in the underground broker networks revolves around money. North Korean women that cannot afford to cross the border are told it is free to cross and then when they cannot pay on the other side they are sold instead. That was my experience. If you want to get involved in helping North Korean women avoid sex trafficking you should fund rescues through organizations like LiNK. The safest way a woman can avoid being trafficked is to have her rescue paid for before she leaves the country. Then when she crosses she can enter a safe network that can move her out of China before she is exploited. ",

If they are caught close to the border with China, it is easier to convince the North Korean authorities that they were in China for economic reasons and intended to come back. If they are caught closer to the border with Southeast Asia it is obvious they were trying to defect and that can carry much harsher consequences. If it is discovered that a North Korean had contact with a South Korean or Christians anywhere in China, that can also increase the chances of facing much harsher punishments. The North Korean government is also incredibly corrupt and bribes from family members to local officials can have an impact on one's sentencing. \n\n\n",

I'm thinking differences in body language, language, food, customs, values, beliefs, etc...\nHow difficult/easy is it for a North Korean to adapt to Korean society?\nIs there a lot of discrimination towards North Koreas living in South Korea? \n(I'm a university student at a university in Sweden and for my final assignment my thesis is how the 65+ years divided have changed the Korean culture, your answers will be of great help, thank you!)  \n",

North Korean culture is more socially conservative so I was very surprised to see couples in the South holding hands and kissing in public.\n\nKorean society is very family oriented. It was very hard at first to adapt in the South when I didn't have a family to see or talk to anymore. On holidays I didn't know what to do because I had no family.\n\nThe South Korean language has so many strange words that are borrowed from English. That took some time to get used to! \n\nIt was also difficult to decide on what to study and what career to pursue. In North Korea, I didn't get to choose what my future would look like. It was kind of overwhelming to choose a path to take when there were so many choices. ",

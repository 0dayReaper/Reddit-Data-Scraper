My team operates at the boundary of research and engineering, delivering cutting-edge research from academia into models in production. Previously, I did applied research on perception and prediction models in self-driving cars at Uber ATG. I also had several years of experience in rendering engines and physics simulation at companies like Crystal Dynamics and Blizzard Entertainment before pivoting to machine learning.\n\nI hold a master\u2019s degree in Computer Science from University of Toronto, a master\u2019s degree in Computer Graphics from University of Pennsylvania and a bachelor degree in Mathematics from Duke University.\n\nPROOF i'm real: [https://imgur.com/kCYTUQ6](https://imgur.com/kCYTUQ6)\n\n**I will be answering your questions** **throughout the week!**\n\nAfter today you can also meet me in a live AMA session via zoom **Next Thursday, Apr 27 at 12pm EST.** Sign up here: [https://info.cohere.ai/amawithstephen](https://info.cohere.ai/amawithstephen)",

Going forward I think the way we analyze LLM's thought process will be more similar to brain simply because the sheer size of parameters in LLM, we'll divide a model's parameters into regions where each one is responsible for different ability, e.g some for language, other for math, or reading. This is a super important aspect that's currently under studied, if we want to effectively control and steer LLM's behaviors and outputs to be safe.",

Where does gathering feedback from users in the RLHF loop stand in getting models to production? That's not really research (unless it's a new method) so I'm wondering if that falls under your umbrella and how you handle versioning from each cycle of RLHF in practice? I'm imagining you need to verify the model has gotten significantly better before updating what users are seeing live - so how much better does a model need to be?\n\n2. Related to your background in physics simulations and rendering, what do you think about slapping a diffusion model on a transformer to render realistic sequences in video games? I'm imagining you can get more realistiic sequences that way but somehow need to connect the randomness of diffusion to the next-sequence probability of a transformer.",

We have multiple indicators for determining whether a model's performance is improved. judging LLMs are hard, it's a combination of evaluation datasets and human evaluation.\n2. perhaps you could use a transformer to initialize noise for temporally connected frames for better consistency. just a hunch",

This will happen I think 2 - 3 years, the models capability is almost there and the eruption of new tools built around them will take us there.  2) AGI in the sense that we can create a conscious agent with desire, thoughts and self-awareness. Right now we don't have any theory or path to achieve this, current paradigm based on deep learning is not it. So I'd say 50+ years or maybe never.",

These models don't have desires but they definitely have \"desires\" which are trained into them due to the underlying bias which allows them to even operate in the first place.\n\nThe whole industry seems to have turned on a dime due to the breakthroughs only recently - in the grand scheme of things, there wasn't that much of a barrier and it makes me wonder if someone were crafty with the maths 4 years earlier we might be in a completely different place.\n\nI agree with your first point regarding AGI as a model/agent capable of completing a majority of tasks that an average human can do. The rapid advancements in AI technologies and tools indeed suggest that we might be moving closer to this goal within the next few years.  \nHowever, I'd like to debate the second point about AGI as a conscious agent with desires, thoughts, and self-awareness. While I acknowledge that we currently lack a clear path to achieve this level of AGI within the deep learning paradigm, there are reasons to remain open to the possibility:\n\n1. Unpredictable advancements: The pace of AI research and development is accelerating, and new breakthroughs in the field often emerge unexpectedly, opening up unforeseen possibilities.  \n2. Interdisciplinary collaboration: As we continue to explore the mysteries of human consciousness through the collaboration of multiple disciplines, such as neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychology, our understanding of conscious agents might provide new insights on how to imbue AGI with similar capabilities.  \n3. New theoretical frameworks: As our knowledge evolves, so too might our theoretical frameworks for understanding AGI. It's possible that novel paradigms may surface in the future that challenge our current assumptions about what's achievable with AI.  \nIt's essential to remain curious and open-minded while acknowledging the limitations of our current understanding when discussing AGI's potential. \n\nEngaging in thought-provoking conversations, such as this one, enables us to explore different viewpoints and fuels the pursuit of new ideas.\n\nAside: I don't believe you've given enough proof to warrant your authenticity - it's definitely a convincing fake ;)",

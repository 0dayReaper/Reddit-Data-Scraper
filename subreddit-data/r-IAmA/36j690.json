I'll start answering questions at 4 p.m. ET. **[Please join our campaign for president at BernieSanders.com/Reddit.](http://berniesanders.com/reddit)**\n\nBefore we begin, let me also thank the grassroots Reddit organizers over at /r/SandersforPresident for all of their support. Great work.\n\nVerification: https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/600750773723496448\n\nUpdate: Thank you all very much for your questions. I look forward to continuing this dialogue with you.",

            "comment": "1. Thank you for the good question. I believe I have been consistent throughout my political life in terms of my basic values and what I stand for. Obviously, when you are a United States senator working in a conservative environment, you often have to do the best that you can within the circumstances that you find yourself. Two particular examples: last year, I helped write the most comprehensive veterans legislation passed in many years. Trust me, I had to change my position on very important aspects of veterans' health care in order to get it passed. In terms of health care, I am an advocate of a Medicare-for-all single-payer program. I voted for the Affordable Care Act, not because I think it is the end place as to where we should be, but because I was able to get a major provision in it that greatly expanded primary health care -- which is helping many millions of people today. So the bottom line is that you have to stick by your values but when you're in an elected position, especially when you're in a conservative Congress, now and then you're going to have to compromise.\n\n2. Great question. And let me repeat what I have said many times. The only way we deal with the major issues facing our country -- raising the minimum wage to a living wage, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, addressing climate change in a bold way, overturning Citizens United, demanding that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, making college affordable for all, etc. -- is when ordinary people put massive pressure on the Congress. Right now, the Congressional leadership represents the interests of the wealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations. Instead of raising the minimum wage, they're giving tax breaks to billionaires and cutting nutrition programs. Nothing will change unless millions of people demand it and that's what this campaign is all about -- mobilizing people at the grassroots level.",

            "comment": "Senator Sanders, I am the founder and moderator of /r/SandersForPresident. As you likely know, we have seen a MASSIVE surge in grassroots support and energy over the last year (most notably, in the weeks following your announcement). \n\nAs a community, what is the SINGLE best way we can use our passion, creativity, and energy to help out and contribute to the cause? \n\nThank you for everything you've done to help the state of Vermont and the United States. And thank you for the shout-out! \n\nEDIT: Since the solicitation of political contributions is likely prohibited in this subreddit, I will not be posting any links. However, if you insist on giving gold to the Senator, I would implore you to instead donate to his campaign. Surely the Senator needs the $5 more than Reddit and Conde Naste do, right?\n\nEDIT x2: I'd like to add. We've been working for a over a year over in /r/SandersForPresident (since December, 2013 to be precise) to build up a large, informative, and supportive knowledge-base for all things pertaining to Senator Sanders. We want him in the White House, and if you're reading this and you have ANY interest in learning more about him, his voting history, and the beliefs he stands for, please pay us a visit! I'm attaching several resources to this comment as well - just keep reading.\n\nIf you want to chip in and help the cause, go ahead and subscribe to the subreddit. Participate as often as possible. Visit multiple times a day, read the comments, and **learn all that you can.** Spread the word far and wide! Bernie DOES have a chance and it's defeatist and flat-out wrong to say anything otherwise - you're just creating a self-fulfilling prophecy if you speak that way. He's honest, authentic, and one of the only people out there standing up for the common men and women of America. But even though it's going to take a lot of work to triumph over Hillary and her endless pockets of Wall Street money, we can still do it. And if you disregard all the stigma and misinformation, and just let his policies and 35 year history do the talking, the choice is obvious. He needs to be the next President of the United States of America. And he can be. \n\n* ~~Link to his official campaign website~~ I'm redacting this link, since their campaign is currently working on a new website, and the current one contains only a donation link and sign up form. I don't want to violate any rules by soliticing these things. **If you would like a direct link to their donations page and registration page, please visit /r/SandersForPresident and click the links in the sidebar.**\n* [Link to his OnTheIssues.org page](http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/bernie_sanders.htm#). Don't let people spread misinformation! Learn as much as you can about Senator Sanders and spread the knowledge far and wide. His opponents will make up whatever kind of baseless, slanderous nonsense possible to derail him and his message. The best way to defend against that is to PROVE them wrong, with citations and facts.  \n* [Link to his official 12-step platform](https://berniesanders.com/issues/)  \n* [Link to register as a volunteer](https://berniesanders.com/volunteer/)  ",

Certainly one of the areas that redditors can help on is in making sure that young people throughout this country understand the importance of politics and government. It is an American tragedy that in the last election, about 80 percent of young people did not vote. That is exactly what the ruling class of this country wants and we have got to change it. So mobilizing, educating and organizing young people is very much at the top of my agenda.",

The middle class is disappearing, the rich get richer, young people cannot afford college, the crisis of climate change is ignored, and Congress continues on its merry way paying attention to the needs of billionaires and multinational corporations. The truth is that we are in a very difficult political moment. But despair of giving up is just not an option. I would not be doing what I am doing if I did not believe that this country could provide health care to all as a right; that we could lead the world in transforming our energy system and dealing with climate change; that we could make education affordable for all. My strong belief is that it is imperative that we maintain our vision of what American can be, and that we fight hard to make that happen. DO NOT GIVE UP.",

            "comment": "Senator Sanders,\n\nI am a student who is returning to Medical School in the fall after completing my undergraduate degree this past May. I was extremely fortunate to have been on scholarship nearly all four years of my undergraduate education and left school with only approximately $6k in student loans. However, returning to school in the fall, I am looking at adding to my student debt by about $58,000 dollars a year for the next four years. This means I will graduate medical school with around $232,000 dollars in student debt going into my residency, on top of the student debt I accrued in my undergraduate studies. Luckily I will be fortunate enough to have a high paying career once I am in my early thirties 7-10 years from now. However, there are students who are not as fortunate as myself, who will have the same amount of debt (and for some, more) with a job that does not pay nearly enough for the amount they were forced to spend on education.\n\n[I recently read about your proposal for a bill that ensures free tuition to American college students.](http://college.usatoday.com/2015/05/19/bernie-sanders-issues-bill-to-make-4-year-colleges-tuition-free/) My question to you is, when you hopefully someday in the future get this legislation through and approved, what will happen to the students who already have mountains of debt to pay off in their names? Is there funding in the bill to alleviate the debt currently possessed by recent and past college graduates?\n\nThank you so much for doing this AMA. I have been encouraging all of my friends and family to do more research on you as a candidate, and so far everyone has been receptive to your ideas and the policies that you stand for. I look forward to one day seeing you in the oval office as the leader of this country.",

We need trade agreements that protect and benefit working families, not just the CEOs of large corporations.\n\nIn terms of getting the attention of elected officials, writing letters and emails as well as phoning is very important. But, what is even more important is grassroots organizing. Putting together a meeting of 100 people about an issue and inviting that elected official to that meeting to hear comments would be a huge step forward in making politicians aware that you know what's going on and that you want your concerns addressed. I have done hundreds of town meetings as an elected official and urge citizens to organize them as fast as they can.",

On the other hand, there is a massive amount of work that needs to be done in this country. Our infrastructure is crumbling and we can create millions of decent-paying jobs rebuilding our roads, bridges, rail system, airports, levees, dams, etc. Further, we have enormous shortages in terms of highly-qualified pre-school educators and teachers. We need more doctors, nurses, dentists and medical personnel if we are going to provide high-quality care to all of our people. But, in direct response to the question, increased productivity should not punish the average worker, which is why we have to move toward universal health care, making higher education available to all, a social safety net which is strong and a tax system which is progressive.",

I would like to ask, why you support this movement (which is primarily based in the assumption that GMO foods are more dangerous than non GMO food) when almost all major scientific and academic communities are in agreement that GMO food poses zero health risks?

With the exception of first-time voters, many of my peers in this age bracket feel burned by false promises and unrealistic expectations established during President Obama's campaign. \n\nWith this in mind: What, **specifically**, do you feel you can **realistically** accomplish in your first term as President that my age bracket can get excited about? You've been outspoken about supporting a $15 minimum wage, progressive tax reform, single-payer health care, and elimination of higher education tuition fees; do you feel like you have the ability to **realistically** bring one or more of these ambitions to fruition if elected president?\n\nThank you for taking the time to do this AMA.

If we do not have tens of millions of people actively involved in the political process, there is very little that any president can do because of the power of big money over the political and economic process. So what I have said time and time again is that we need a political revolution in this country, which means that 80 percent. of the people vote, not 40 percent, and which means that people demand that Congress represent the middle class and working families of this country and not just the billionaire class.",

Could you give some opinions on emerging nuclear technology, such as reactors with passive safety mechanisms, the ability to consume spent fuel rods from other (pressurized water) plants, and fusion?  Since nuclear power has close to the lowest amount of human deaths per kilowatt hour of electricity generated ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/2/ ) , is it fair to cut all taxpayer funding to developing newer forms of nuclear power while subsidizing others?\n\nFor the record I am hopeful that you will win in 2016 regardless of whether or not we see eye to eye on this issue.

I am with you on this and I think the Scandinavian countries (and even further, the Nordic countries) have social democracy down near perfect.\n\nBesides the healthcare and education services provided in these countries, would you consider prison reform in the United States? There are articles about Norwegian prisons and their humaneness, and it seems responsible to do what they do. They are designed to treat and prepare the prisoners for re immersion into normal life, they give them a nurturing environment, and they give them time to relax, such as recording studios and sports. A similar or identical method would really set an example for America being a champion of human rights (that it can and should be). \n\nWhat do you think of this?

While we do receive medical/dental and other valuable benefits, we far too often see those that separate from the armed forces left hanging in limbo as it has been shown through recent VA incidents. Also, aside from that, our country, more specifically our Congress, has been unable to pass a budget thus resulting in sequestration, and that is something many active service members both here at home and abroad are affected by on a daily basis. So my questions are to you:\n\n1. What is your plan to effectively apply better medical and mental health treatment to our veterans, both in and out of the service? \n\n2. What can we expect from your presidency moving forward regarding the funding of our armed forces?\n\nThanks for your time, I hope to receive a reply!",

            "comment": "Mr. Sanders,\n\nI am a 17 year old high school student and am excited to have the opportunity to vote for you in the first election that I have ever been eligible to vote in. I didn't think I would ever find a \"perfect candidate\" whose views are essentially in line with all of mine, but after reading through your voting records and your stances on various issues, I feel like I have found one in the first election I will ever be voting in. I have signed on to put up lawn signs and make phone calls for you and have been advocating for you strongly on social media and to my friends who will also be voting for the first time in this upcoming election. Many of them hadn't heard of you, but after urging them to look into your policies and voting record, some have come over to your side and pledged to vote for you. \n\nThis brings me to my question. When I spread the word about your campaign to my friends and peers, many of them take a quick glance at your Wikipedia page and cry out \"He's a socialist!\" I try to explain to them that there is a distinction between democratic socialism and socialism, and that socialism isn't this horrible thing that it has come to be thought of, but because of the negative connotation of the word \"Socialism\" in this day and age, they refuse to listen. How would you suggest I go about explaining what socialism actually is and why they should encourage it rather than see it as a bad thing? \n\nThanks. Bernie Sanders 2016",

And to be fair, I have been counseled against you by my family, my friends, and most of the conservative people I rub shoulders with.  I myself like to expand my horizons, and am drawing more and more to voting in your favor.  To be honest, despite all the counsel, I like you.  And I've liked what you've stood for.\n\nMy question is:  My wife is a teacher.  She is also a huge Hilary fan.  She has been raked over the coals by the education system, specifically with the \"it's all who you know, not how well you teach\" mentality in bringing strong teachers to the forefront (she's been in the top 1 percent effectiveness in the county for 5 years and still can't move into administration despite a double masters in the field).  \n\nWhat do you plan on doing differently than Hilary to increase the strength of our education system?  Especially with standardized testing and the proven dysfunction that comes along with it.",

I'm a cyclist who commutes to work in a relatively bike friendly city in order to reduce my carbon footprint, but I recognize much of the country lacks the appropriate infrastructure for people to safely and efficiently travel via bicycle.\n\nWould you be willing to include plans for more expansive, protected bike lanes to make cities more bike-friendly or finishing transnational bike paths that already exist in your planned infrastructure bill? It seems to me that doing so would kill two birds with one stone and use an already planned revamp of infrastructure to further reduce our dependence on automobiles.\n",

            "comment": "Senator Sanders,\n\nI am a 28 year old male and married to the love of my life for almost a year and a half.  I work at a University, attend the University; My wife graduated from college in Germany with very high marks, and her Bachelor Thesis will be published in a Journal next month.  We have been dealing with the USCIS as well as the NVC for well over a year at this point.  I make more than double the poverty limit, we are both educated individuals who will never take anything from the community we cannot give back.  Currently, we are both living with our parents, money saved, and she is working at a restaurant/hotel until this whole, long, tiresome immigration process is done.  Her skills are not only going to waste in Germany, but what she can bring to the USA is being wasted as well.  She has a dream; to start a business here doing positive things for our communities.  My question is this --- What can you do to help reduce the amount of time it takes for this process?  We feel like it is simply an outlandish amount of time, and quite frankly it's not fair that some people have immigrated to the US illegally and have been forgiven for it, and it takes us 16+ months at this point and we are still waiting for the NVC to review our documents.  I am not against people immigrating to the USA, everyone has the right to feel safe and secure, and if the USA gives better opportunities I welcome people from around the world with open arms.  I'm not asking about big immigration reform, I'm asking about simply reducing processing times at the USCIS and NVC in order to make it more efficient to get loved ones into the US.  I hope I am not too late in this AMA because I am very curious to how you feel about the USCIS/NVC processing times and what you could do.  \n\nI support you on many levels, but this is one of the biggest issues that have an impact on my life right now.  (obviously I'm concerned with campaign finance reform but I know where you stand on that)\n\nThanks for doing this AMA.  Many, many, many people appreciate it.",

Just a few questions that I was wondering about.\n\n\n1. We have seen the budget continue to go down in recent years and I feel that if this budget issue isn't addressed soon, NASA will not have the resources it needs to complete its current goals involving us exploring outward into space. What is your stance on NASA's budget and the continued exploration of our solar system from the Moon to Europa to Mars?\n\n\n2. What is your opinion the possibility on an independent Kurdistan in the middle east? Do you support it, oppose it or are generally indifferent as in now about it?\n\n\n3. Do you have plans to reach out to many farmers and lower wage people who might be normally considered Republican in regions such as Alabama, Louisiana, Kansas and the like? There are many people out there who would greatly benefit from your stances, such as farmers and the like, who I think you could definitely get support from if you visited these communities and spoke with them.\n\n\n4. Lastly, I thought it would be nice to end on a lighter note. I've followed you for a few months now and I've loved so many of your policies, especially the 12 Initiatives (or Common Sense as I like to call it). But I was hoping to learn a little bit more about Bernie the person. What are 3 things about you that people don't know about? It could be favorite movie, childhood memory, anything.\n\n\nThank you so much for doing this AMA! Best of luck on the trail and let's win this election! :)\n\n\n",

    "postText": "**[You can catch our livestream of the event here at 10 AM EST](https://www.facebook.com/fightfortheftr/videos/2135883156734125/)**\n\nThis morning at 10 AM EST, members of the Senate Energy and Commerce Committee will be [holding a hearing](https://www.facebook.com/fightfortheftr/videos/2135883156734125/) demanding answers from FCC Chairman Ajit Pai about the phony \u201ccyber attack\u201d the FCC repeatedly used to downplay the overwhelming opposition to the agency\u2019s repeal of net neutrality. The agency lied to Congress about the alleged attack, which was said to have happened right as millions of John Oliver viewers were trying to file pro-net neutrality comments following the comedians viral broadcast. As a result many voices were excluded from the record, making the FCC\u2019s repeal corrupt and illegitimate.\n\n**Head over to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) or call (202) 759-7766 to take action and tell your Representatives in Congress to support the net neutrality Congressional Review Act resolution, which if passed would overturn the repeal.**\n\nWe\u2019re net neutrality experts and advocates defending the open internet, and we\u2019re here to answer your questions about the hearing today, or anything else related to net neutrality, so ask us anything!

Whether those enemies are international allies or your neighbors, I find that there is a serious lack of empathy for anyone with a proud R by their name.\n\nedit: a lot of people upset by my last paragraph.  Let me just say, I find a lot more people looking for good in the world siding and fighting on the D side than the R, and if you're not voting D or R, your votes are literally useless.  That's why being knowledgeable is key... as I said before.  Know who you're voting for and what they stand for.\n\nI come from GA where the governor race is an atrocity, and it is very clear who is trying protect vs persecute in the race.  I'll leave it at that.",

This definitely provides a bigger opening for lawmakers in the House to sign the discharge petition to pass the CRA and reverse the FCC's move to gut net neutrality. Many lawmakers, including Republicans, want to sign the discharge, because they know doing so is what their constituents want, especially ahead of the midterms -- but there is also some hesitancy to buck House leadership by signing the discharge. It's up to internet users and the public to highlight the FCC's lies and flawed process with their members of Congress -- if reps hear enough from their constituents on this, it can give them the resolve to sign the discharge. We've seen this, including with Republican Rep. Mike Coffman signing the discharge, but we have to use every opportunity, including the FCC's handling of this phony cyber attack, to keep pressure on lawmakers.",

[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/net-neutrality-fcc-protests\\_us\\_5a2a147ce4b069ec48ac307e](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/net-neutrality-fcc-protests_us_5a2a147ce4b069ec48ac307e) This was along with millions of calls and emails to Congress -- and what we saw in the aftermath was pretty convincing. After this public display of opposition to the FCC's move to end net neutrality, all 49 Senators in the Democratic Caucus supported the CRA to reverse the FCC -- and getting all 49 Dems on board in the Senate is \\*never\\* a given. Then, Republican Senators Collins, Murkowski and even Kennedy in Louisiana signed on, and no one really could have predicted this with any kind of confidence in late 2017. I 100% understand the skepticism, but I think we've seen on net neutrality that there is absolutely an opening to persuade lawmakers on this -- they've seen the polls that show nearly 9 out of 10 Americans oppose the FCC's repeal, and they're feeling the pressure from constituents. If we can keep it up, we can definitely get the 40 more reps we need in the House this year. It won't be easy, but we're not giving up anytime soon.",

At the very least, what are Pai and co. gonna do with another massive outcry? Claim that they were cyberattacked again? Nah. These sorts of outrageous lies only work once. But let's say they fudge it again somehow (uh...blame it on ISIS? Aliens?): how about on the 3rd massive outcry? How many outcries before they're like \"okay okay okay guys could you please close your eyes, take a deep breath, and shut the fuck up? You're right, this is an oligarchy and your voices don't matter. Happy now? *Shut the fuck up!*\" This outlandish hypothetical would be a huge (but perhaps pyrrhic) victory. \n\nAgain, you're right in that the bridges between constituents and reps are in woeful disrepair. In an ideal democracy, the outcry works the first time, and we should strive to improve our gov't in that regard. \n\nDespite its flaws, however, America is still far from a dumpster-tier autocracy. Keep forcing their hand; they'll run out of lies; they'll be forced into the uncomfortable choice between saying, \"we don't care, we're doing it anyways\" or actually listening.",

That said, there is a very good chance that this phony DDoS attack saga will continue to haunt him, and could hasten his departure from the FCC. Perhaps more importantly, it will almost definitely be the subject of litigation, and could eventually lead to a judge overturning the FCC repeal based on the fact that the agency failed to maintain a functional way for the public to have input into their proceeding. It's something we should all be speaking out about and demanding our members of Congress DO SOMETHING about. They are supposed to provide oversight for the FCC. That's their job. **[Call your rep](https://www.battleforthenet.com)** and ask what they're doing about the fact that Ajit Pai lied to them. Tell them to sign the discharge petition and vote for the CRA resolution to restore net neutrality. ",

I can tell you definitively that letters you write and emails you send are read/seen by an intern for maybe a total of five seconds before being trashed. Your opinion turns into maaaaaybe a tick mark on a spreadsheet if you\u2019re lucky, but most likely is never mentioned again, PARTICULARLY when you use a template that some group says \u201cSign your name to this and send it to your representative!\u201d When were getting 200 of the same letter/email a day, they\u2019re just chucked. At least in the office I worked in. \n\nIf you want to call, great, you\u2019ll still be talking to an intern. You might have better luck if you ask for the legislative aide that\u2019s in charge of whatever issue you\u2019re calling about, maybe you could even talk to the chief of staff, but chances are low low low. In all the time I worked there, I saw the congressman pick up the phone and talk to a constituent about once every four months. And the fact that he did even that was pretty unheard of for a congressman. \n\nThese people represent hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions (if they\u2019re senators) of people. The system they prop up was never designed to work on such a large scale. If you want to be heard, get numbers behind you. Either in terms of people or $$$. Otherwise, I\u2019m sorry to say, your opinion doesn\u2019t matter to anyone in DC. ",

This video would stream fine from the browser, they just won't let you without the app.\n\nFYI if you want to use Facebook messenger mobile without the app, you still can but you have to use 'desktop browsing mode' while on m.facebook.com to make it work.  If you are on the regular site in desktop mode it deletes everything you type from mobile.",

While I don't condone death threats or other violent threats against anyone, why is this one of the only times we heard them touch on NN?! Of course its fucking Cruz saying NN was a mistake, and I could have missed earlier comments against the repeal- but no one has brought up the fake DDOS, the fake comment submissions, or has directly made Pai answer for these actions. It is incredibly depressing seeing the people we voted in power not take this seriously on a public stage. \"FCC oversight\", what a fucking joke. ",

To get a little bit geeky, that's because ISP's have what we call a \"terminating access monopoly\" - that is, they have the only internet line into your home, and even if you hate what they're doing, and even if there are other providers that can serve you, there's nothing you can do because you only have one internet subscription. Companies that operate on the internet are different in that regard. Even though some are really powerful (some would argue too powerful), they don't have the same type of terminating access monopoly that the ISPs do.",

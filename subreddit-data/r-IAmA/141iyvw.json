If you are here, then you know the word Pilates.You probably know Pilates was a person. Joseph Pilates was the inventorof the method. You may know a whole lot about the history of Pilates oryou may know very little, but either way there is a copyright lawsuitpending right now that affects you directly or a teacher or studio thatyou know and love.\n\nSeveral Pilates teachers have had their entire social media accountserased! Instructors losing their livelihood should not be happening.\n\nHave you ever seen or shared a photo of Joseph Pilates? If so, you could be at risk too.\n\nPilates Instructor Mary Kelly is being sued for posting pictures onInstagram. The PTP is helping raise money so that Mary wins the case andso that this never happens again.\n\nGot questions? Ask us anything!\n\n[HEAR THE HORROR STORIES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw6FKZRtr_c&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\n[DEFEND YOUR ACCESS TO PILATES HISTORY](https://www.gofundme.com/f/preserve-your-rightful-access-to-pilates-history)\n\n[FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM](https://www.instagram.com/pilatestransparencyproject/?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==)",

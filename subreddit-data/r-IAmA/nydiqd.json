I thought that was it, I was done.\n\n3. My head was just spinning, I could feel the whale swimming around and I was just thinking that there was almost no way out of this.\n\n4. The whale is alive and well.",

Packard sustained multiple serious injuries to his abdomen and upper body. The rescuers that found the remaining five passengers after two nights in the jungle said they wouldn\u2019t have survived another night.\"\n\nThere seems to have been a TV show called \"I shouldn't be alive\" or something like that that featured him.",

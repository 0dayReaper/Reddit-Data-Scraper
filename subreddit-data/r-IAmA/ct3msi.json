Even those that did not purchase the book. Which I know  from personal experience, I was a poor college freshman (majoring in food science largely because of you) and could not afford the book  (I regret not pinching a few pennies at the time because it would have been really awesome to have a signed copy) my best friend and I waited in line forever and really appreciate you staying, it must have been a very long night. \n\nYou also told a woman that inquired about gluten free recipies that the gluten free fad was stupid, however if she had celiac disease, you apologize. \n\nThank you for all the inspiration you have provided for not only me, but thousands (and probably more) out there!",

Fast forward 10 years to me completing my BA in Culinary Science in August of last year. You were the first source of culinary inspiration and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nMy question is regarding the current trend of fine dining. It seems the growing \"gormet casual\" scene is becoming more popular than the traditional suit and tie fine dining. I've also found that, in my own dining experience, the chefs behind the menus in these restaurants tend to pump out better, more creative food in far more approachable atmosphere. My favorite restaurant right now is Coquette (in New Orleans): they gave me a better dining experience with similar quality ingredients at a quarter of the price of some traditional fine dining restaurants within a couple blocks. Have you found this to be true in other cities? Do you think this trend will continue? Other thoughts?\n\nThanks!",

Opened it around Christmastime and loved it, and instantly regretting only making a half batch. I ended up having to just give out shot glass sized samples of it to people who tried it. I made a full batch of it in early July and it's just sitting in the back of my fridge getting better and better each month. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to say thank you for this recipe, as well as a bunch of other great ones that I use on a regular basis!\n\nSince this is an AMA, I guess I'll ask a question. I know you hate single-use kitchen gadgets, but are there any that you have and use on a regular basis that are worth it in your opinion?",

Why yeast makes things rise. Why spices taste better freshly ground,  etc. \n\nMy question is: How did you manage to join food and science so flawlessly and what inspired you to do so? Also...what\u2019s in your pocket? \n\nThank you for your time and the inspiration! Cooking has become a huge part of who I am, largely thanks to you.",

I'm a workaholic but I think I use that as an excuse not to engage and give of myself. I'm ashamed of that I'm I'm hoping to find something in me to fix it. I'm fortunate that so many people around me are more giving and caring than I am. Also...dogs. Dogs are wonderful. Shoot...you got me monologuing!",

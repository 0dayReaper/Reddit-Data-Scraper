Hi there! this is [me](http://i.imgur.com/CDPaYgj.jpg) and it's nice to meet you. I worked at Walt Disney World for over [twenty-five years](http://i.imgur.com/bHRvqkq.jpg)! I was a [Bandit](http://i.imgur.com/4qkviAA.jpg), [Gangster](http://i.imgur.com/Zj1bJ4X.jpg) and [Tour Guide](http://imgur.com/rjXVi9X.jpg) at the [Great Movie Ride](http://i.imgur.com/EwilJnv.jpg), sold [merchandise](http://imgur.com/ig06LYh.jpg) in a few stores, worked in Guest Services at the Polynesian (couldn't find any pics) then [Guest Relations](http://imgur.com/hCGeQ9K.jpg) as a [Tour Guide](http://imgur.com/uZ4ioHJ.jpg) but in 1996 I transferred to the [Character department](http://i.imgur.com/kUVjmvI.jpg) and I never looked back! I know you guys are big on proof so look at [this](http://imgur.com/WqgWsQM.jpg) then look at [this](http://imgur.com/YguG2PR.jpg). Oh, here's some [MEGA proof](http://i.imgur.com/M5ac9KF.jpg). Just for fun, here's a pic of [me teaching](http://imgur.com/iPnmPes.jpg) the \"official\" Disney Princess Wave and [playing before parade](http://imgur.com/iSMI7sy.jpg), me in the [Mickey Mania Parade](http://imgur.com/eyzEZ7T.jpg) and here's me in the [airport](http://imgur.com/6ohNduK.jpg) bringing in a [plane](http://imgur.com/MDFIgSb.jpg) for a press event!\n\nI'll answer any questions you might have unless they get too personal or weird (I know reddit) so go ahead! Ask Me Anything!\n\nEdit: Before this post gets archived I want to thank the Reddit community for giving me so much support and encouragement. I am truly honored to be among you. I'm truly touched by all of the gold you gave me for [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5h7gq8/i_was_goofy_at_walt_disney_world_for_over_20/day38fu/). I'm glad you liked that story. Above all, I sincerely want to thank you for [what you did for the Florida Hospital](http://www.upworthy.com/20-years-ago-he-helped-two-kids-at-disney-world-today-his-story-helped-even-more?c=hpstream). It was truly inspirational and it brought me so much joy. Now, as Mickey would say, \"See ya real soon!\"\n\nEdit 2: I found two videos of me performing Goofy in case you're interested:  \n[Clip 1 (long)](https://youtu.be/FkKuLatP1GQ)  [Clip 2 (short)](https://youtu.be/cwJM5xXlTGk)",

All of the expansions tore it all to shreds though. :( There are a LOT of attractions I miss terribly though. Horizons was such a peaceful ride (and cool as shit) and Journey into Imagination with the original figment had so many amazing tricks in it. I miss Delta Dream Flight and Mr. Toad's Wild Ride a lot too.",

It'll help if you know around when you met him and where he worked (so they can find him easier) but it means a lot for a CM to receive a guest letter. We get to take the letter home and get a certificate and it's a really big deal that means a lot to CMs",

At the Emporium it's a pretty big deal, a leader will have an informal meeting, and the person being recognized gets called to the front as the letter is read out loud to everyone.

It's the reason I left a good job as a VIP Tourguide and moved to the Character Department.\n\nI was working City Hall one day when two guests came in with two little girls. One was in a wheel chair and the other one looked like she had just seen death. Both were cut and bruised and the one in the wheelchair had her arm in a cast. The two women were actually nurses from a hospital and were asking for a refund on the girl's tickets, something we avoided doing at all costs. When I asked why they told me the story. The two girls were with their mom and dad at Epcot and on the way home they got into a horrible car accident. The mother was beheaded right in front of them. The father eventually died too but the two girls didn't know that yet. They were from overseas and had no money and no contact information for anyone they knew. They were bringing the tickets back to get the girls some much needed money to help get them back home. My heart absolutely sunk. If you had seen these girls you'd know why. They were truly traumatized. I refunded their tickets and got permission to be their private tour guide for the rest of the day (which they were not expecting). I walked them to the VIP viewing area for the parade which was as far as I could walk them in the costume we used to wear at City Hall. I had to leave them there while I put on my VIP costume. On the way down I pulled out every kid joke I could think of. I was a REALLY good tour guide (I helped write part of it) and I knew how to make kids smile. Nothing worked. These girls were too far gone for that. I left them at the bridge to go change, walked backstage and bawled my eyes out. I just had never seen something so horrible. I was truly affected and it was a terrible feeling of powerlessness not being able to fix the situation. When I came back I brought them to get ice-cream, take them on rides and stuff but they never smiled, not once. The nurses were loving it and were trying to get them into it but it just wasn't working. We went back to the bridge to watch the parade. It was there that I honestly saw true magic. Real magic, not bullshit. I had called the parade department to let them know what was going on and set up a private meet and greet after the parade. As the parade was coming around Liberty Square I told the girls that I had called Mickey and told him all about them. I told them that Mickey asked to meet them after the parade.\n\nThe little girl in the wheelchair smiled.\n\n\"Really?\" she asked. My heart skipped. \"Yes, really! He told me to tell you to look out for him in the parade and to follow the float back to City Hall.\"\n\nThe other girl smiled.\n\n\"You mean right now?\" she asked. \n\nIt had worked. They were talking. Not laughing, but talking. It was the first time I had heard them speak. Every single parade performer came up to them on the bridge and told them to look out for Mickey. Every one of them told them that. When Mickey's float came up Mickey (who was attached to a pole at the top of the float) managed to turn her body sideways, look down at the girls and point towards Main Street. That was all it took. The girls were excited now. They had forgotten about death. They were lost in a magical world and I couldn't believe I was watching it unfold in front of my eyes. We followed that float all the way back to City Hall, singing \"Mickey Mania\" the whole way. Back then, City Hall used to have a VIP lounge behind the desk that was for privacy during difficult situations or to host celebrities. I took them in and showed them the book where all of the autographs were. They were eating it up. \n\nThe girl who was Mickey that day got down off her float and without even taking her head off walked up to me backstage and said \"Let's go.\" I walked in with Mickey behind me so I got to see the exact moment the girls met their new friend. They got shy but Mickey was in control now. Those girls met the REAL Mickey Mouse that day. Every single parade character stayed dressed to meet those girls. One by one they'd come in and play a bit then leave. We were in that lounge for over an hour. Mickey stayed in costume the entire time (which is hard to do after a parade). When Mickey finally said goodbye I had two excited girls on my hands that couldn't stop smiling. They talked and talked and talked. We had a wonderful day after that but what I remember most is when we walked by the rose garden, the older one said \"Oh, my mommy loves roses! I mean...\" and she stopped. I held out my hand and walked her to the gate, picked her up and put her on the other side and said \"Pick one!\" She looked happy as she picked out her favorite rose. She didn't say anything more and she didn't need to. I said goodbye to the wonderful nurses and the wonderful girls then walked backstage behind the train station. This time I didn't cry. It felt so good to be a part of that. I realized that as much as I liked helping guests at City Hall, the true magic of Disney was in the character department. I auditioned, transferred and never looked back.\nThanks for letting me relive this. It was a special day for me.",

It's undeniably one of the more traumatizing events a human being can experience. I was 11 years old when I developed an extreme anxiety over death and spent the next ten years locked in my bedroom with crippling fear of being struck by lightening or hit by a meteor. You stop trusting the world. Everything is scary and everything is dangerous because when you're a little kid your parents are like invincible gods. And you just watched those gods die. It shatters whatever your reality was and completely requires your brain to think everybody and everything wants to kill you, too.\n\nBut you showed those girls that none of that is true. You showed them that tragedies happen, but that doesn't mean the world is evil. You showed them, in their most vulnerable and terrified moment, that they didn't need to feel that way because there would be people to help. I can honestly say that had I met an adult like you during my time of need, my entire outlook life would have been different. Thank you, so much, for making those girls feel safe. It meant everything to them.",

She tried so hard, and actually got him to interact with her, but not nearly as much as I'm sure she hoped.) But he really did have fun. And when he opened up and interacted with Buzz and Lotso it was great.\n\nHe still talks about it all the time, which for a 3 year old is a feat.\n\n\n(He is in remission now, for the last year. It's Leukemia so treatment takes years, but he's doing great with it. In case anyone was wondering.)\n\nEdit: *Stop reading here if you hate edits about gold and donating* Thanks so much for the gold! Glad my story touched some people. \n\n\nInstead of any further gold in the future, You can donate your time or money to a cause that helps with Childhood Cancer. In 2015 less than 4% of NIH spending was used on pediatric cancers, despite cancer being the deadliest disease among children. \n\nCheck with your local hospital's pediatric wing to see what you can do. Ours has a person called a Child Life Specialist that handles keeping the kids happy and entertained. They need toys. This year my wife and I teamed with another Family that's been doing a toy drive for 3 years, and we're working on gathering 1000 toys to donate (I believe we cracked 800 yesterday with a week to go)\n\nA lot of hospitals have, or know, local charities that will donate grants to families in medical need. You can donate to them.\n\nIf you live near Orlando, or spend any extended amount of time there, please consider volunteering at [Give Kids the World](http://www.gktw.org). They're an incredible organization that gives Make-a-wish kids a place to stay during their trip. Not only that but tons of activities to do for free. We spent one day just playing there. OP mentioned this place in another comment.\n\nIf that's too much work (which I would understand) you can also just browse GoFundMe for someone in need that catches your eye.\n\nhttps://www.pinkyswear.org\n\nhttp://curesearch.org\n\nhttps://giving.childrensmn.org/\n\nhttps://www.stjude.org\n\nhttp://www.lls.org/\n\nAnd for good measure, here I am with him in some already cried on [Buzz Lightyear](http://i.imgur.com/THfi3TS.jpg) makeup!",

For the most part the face performers are as much a character as any of us. Some of them are the sweetest people I've ever met in my life.",

They don't prepare you for details like that in training. You're just supposed to figure it out yourself. Never met Powerline unfortunately.",

I loved every single minute while on set (for the most part) and some of my co-workers will be friends for life. You get out of it what you put into it. ",

It's a tie between having my life threatened at a Grad Night party one time and one time I had to tell a guest that their son was in jail for stealing from one of the stores and she did not take it very well. Best guest experience? I've got too many to mention. One that stands out is when I was working at Mickey's Character Spot at Epcot. There was an older gentleman that came up in the queue but didn't come see me, he just sort of stood in the back and watched me for a while. After about 20 minutes he came up to me and said \"Goofy, I had a special friend that would want you to have this.\"  In Goofy you have to look down in order to make it look like Goofy is looking at you so I couldn't see him but I heard him holding back the tears. He was shaking a bit but he gave me a hug anyway. I will never forget that hug. It was one of those hugs that last with you. He was crying in my arms. He had given me [this](http://imgur.com/uAgj7xv.jpg) which is a pin they give to family members or friends of POWs and MIAs. It's become one of my most prized possessions.",

When I was a cast member there, they actually severely injured a Mickey. No joke. Some of the grad night kids picked up a Mickey Mouse character in costume and threw her off the bridge that separates Tomorrow Land from Cinderella's castle/the hub. She landed in the \"creek\" below and broke her back. I was a cast member at the time and had quite a few fur-character friends who were mouse/chipmunk height. It was a sad sad day. \n\nEdit: They don't do gradnight anymore as of 2011. ",

Probably not helped by the fact that my group in almost its entirety of about 14 of us dropped acid on the way.  The one thing of note I remember was we were getting high in the Swiss Family Robinson tree house and realized we were only one of about 4 groups of people all doing the same.  The next year when I went again, Swiss Family Robinson tree house was closed off.  When I asked why I was told \"We had some issues last year.\"",

One that does stand out was at [Give Kids The World](http://www.gktw.org) which is where all the Make-a-Wish kids stay when they come to Disney (truly a magical spectacular place). A woman came up with her son who was born with a birth defect that meant he had no muscles in his neck. He looked REALLY bad and his head had to be supported by his mom. This was a special circumstance. The kid's wish was to be held by Goofy. That's it. Just to be held. The mother told me that because of his \"life problems\" everyone is afraid to even touch him. She laid him very carefully in my arms (sitting on the ground) and let go. We rocked back and forth on that floor for what seemed forever. It was one of the times where I forgot I had the costume on and I just cried and cried. He was such a special kid. I'll never forget that.",

One of our greeters (that's what they called them then, they're attendants now) was a trans woman (that wasn't fooling anyone) and the police came and picked her up backstage. Evidently she was the father of a missing child and she was hiding out at Disney. Fucked up huh? There was also the infamous Michael Chartrand case who was the Tigger that felt up one of the guests. That was a really embarrassing blemish for Disney. It was on the front page of the Orlando Sentinel which is plopped down on everyone's doorstep at Disney (in the premium resorts anyway). He got his job back (there was a totally bizarre court case. His lawyer actually dressed up as Tigger to give the closing arguments) but he was fired a few years later for allegedly doing the same thing to one of the photographers.",

There was a weird power glitch and all of the attractions went down at the same time and had to be evacuated. When they do the Fire Code estimates of how many people can be in the park at one time it is assumed that people will be in the rides. The Fourth of July is one of the park's busiest days of the year. Everyone dumped into the common areas of the park and it became dangerously crowded. One guest freaked out and pulled out something sharp and started stabbing guests to get out. I had to bring a stabbed guest back to her hotel to get her ID so she could go to the hospital. I'd never been so thankful to get off the desk in City Hall. That was a nightmare.",

(In any public forum, you're supposed to say you are \"friends with\" the character you portray in order to avoid implying they are anything less than real (for the benefit of anyone who wants to preserve the magic(i.e. the children))).\n\nIf any part of your costume starts to get loose, you are to place one hand over \"your\" eye. Your character attendant says, \"Goofy, do you have something in your eye?\" You nod, and your character attendant escorts you offstage to fix the problem. Of course, this is the ideal situation.\n\nAs far as signatures go, it's just practice, practice, practice. This is especially true for Goofy. Your eyes are Goofy's mouth. Goofy's eyes are up above your head. When taking pictures or stuff like that, you look at people's feet so that Goofy can look them in the eye. When signing, Goofy has to be looking at the book, not you. Have to hold your arms way above your head and sign without looking. So that's how you have to practice too.",

They lost something when Michael Eisner took over. For example, the park used to close at 6PM on Christmas eve so that the cast could be with their families. They used to close the park and have Christmas parties just for us. We were allowed to ride the rides in our costumes and do things we wouldn't normally do for the day guests. They don't do that anymore. They're open until 2AM and open up early the next day. There's an atmosphere that's just gone now. The new management (I mean after 9/11 specifically) is very concerned about the bottom line (read: money). That's not just me being bitter, that's shown in everything they do. For example, there are very few (and I mean a handful) character managers that were actually characters. That used to be unheard of. As far as breaking character, only a few times when the circumstances warranted it. They were far in between. :)",

You will sweat more than you ever have in your life before 10:00 AM. Take advantage of Tip#1 and STAY HYDRATED.\n\n3. The Florida sun can be BRUTAL in summer months. Get sunscreen, sunglasses, hats, mister fans, cold towels, etc. before you arrive. You don't want to pay Disney prices for these items and you will NEED them.\n\n4. Don't push your kids too hard. Parents know how expensive the vacation is and want to squeeze every last second of fun out of it that they can. However, if you are a seven year old, walking around for twelve hours in Florida conditions can get miserable very fast. How much fun can you have when your whole body is aching after the first day?\n\n5. Stroller rentals can be worth it. Stroller rentals can seem pricey at first glance. ($15 for a single-wide, $31 for a double wide last I checked). These prices are per day and transfer between all 4 parks. A stroller can help your kids keep going through a long day and can help you carry bags of stuff. Just be careful what you leave in it if you park outside an attraction.\n\n6. Plan your day, but be flexible. Know which things you absolutely must do and which are fun but optional. As stated before, take your time and be patient with your kids (or childlike adults). Disney really is a magical place and it is important to slow down and experience it rather than rushing from one thing to the next.\n\n7. Talk to cast members, especially if it is your first visit. No, I mean actually talk to us. Don't just say \"Whichwaytospacemountain?\" and start walking away before we barely have a chance to point. Cast members get complimentary park admission so we know all the tricks, know the best food, know which shows to see and which to skip. Let us know what kinds of things you want to experience and we will clue you in. We also have special guides which let us in on information that is not published for guests.\n\n8. Prohibited items include selfie sticks (ask a stranger take your picture and then offer to take theirs), wagons(strollers are better anyway, keep your kids in front of you), large hardshell coolers(bring a small, softshell one with snacks if you want), and masks/costumes for guests over a certain age(customized t-shirts can be a fun, creative, pre-vacation project, help you pick your group out of the crowd, and be a nice souvenir). If you have a bag, it will be searched before entering, please open all the zippers before you get to the security guard so he doesn't have to do it for you.\n\nI'll try to think of some more. There are so many things to consider, especially for first timers.\n\nEDIT: The heat conditions are very real in the summer months(when I was last at WDW in August, a young girl passed out from the heat). However, winter can get cool/cold. Depends on where you're from and what you're used to. Bottom line, do your research, don't make assumptions, come prepared.",

Disney has lost their focus and the old Disney Cast Members that held those old company values have all retired but Disney is a great company to work for regardless. I can give you an example of how corporate Disney has taken over what I like to call Traditional Disney. The place where all of the characters used to break was called the Zoo. Everyone knew the characters as [The Zoo Crew](http://imgur.com/NCbiP1X.jpg). If you wanted a character you either called the head room or the Zoo. It was a Disney tradition and everyone got a kick out of it. Then this guy named David (who was the Entertainment Vice President) came in and didn't think that sounded too professional so he changed the name to the Base. Eventually all the Zoo signs came down and were replaced. The Zoo disappeared and it got sterile really quick. We used to have nice big couches to relax on and David had them all thrown out and replaced by metal chairs. A part of the character department died that day. Anyway, they're way too concerned with \"numbers\" now. We used to just stroll the parks and play with people but in the end we were all held accountable to see as many guests as we possibly could during our sets. They HOUND you to go faster and faster. They figure 23 seconds (a number I pulled out of my butt mind you but I know it's under 30) is plenty of time to see a family of 4. I turned into an autograph machine towards the end but I always stayed true to my character. A lot of performers don't do that anymore. It's sad.",

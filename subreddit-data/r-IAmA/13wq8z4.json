A non-for-profit organization that collaborates with universities, notably Boston and Cambridge to research the effects of a shorter work week on people and companies.\n\nI have a a background in behaviour science and a PhD focused on the impact of fatigue and sleep deprivation in healthcare workers. \n\nI'm passionate about the transformative power of shorter working hours and the positive impact they can have on people's lives. Especially, recently with the rise in stress, burnout and inflation! On a mission to create a million new years of free time.\n\nAsk me anything!\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://postimg.cc/JD8smNW3)!\n\nEDIT: Hi, this is Alex Pang, director at 4DWG and author of the books SHORTER and WORK LESS, DO MORE, about the 4-day week movement. Dale is off but I'll be around to answer some more questions.\n\nEDIT2: This is Alex signing off. Thanks everyone for your great questions!",

Some other companies bring in the 4 day week whereby some staff work Mon-Thurs, others work Tues-Fri, others work Wed-Sat etc - so there is continuous service provision.\n\nCertainly something we'll keep an eye on though over the coming few months. The city of Valencia evaluated city wide outcomes in April which i'll hopefully get some insights in and be able to share soon!",

So it's possible that demand for leisure and hospitality services will increase, but the question will be how providers respond.",

They had a banner couple months, broke sales records, but the GM who introduced it left and their replacement seems to have killed off the program. \n\nHere's GM James Boening [talking about it](https://www.cbtnews.com/virginia-lexus-dealer-takes-whole-new-approach-to-employee-retention-customer-experience/):\n\n&gt;We have gone to, which is everybody\u2019s going to be like, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d We went to a four day work week.  It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a sales manager, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a GSM, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a salesperson, an FNI manager, it doesn\u2019t matter. I mean, everyone is on a four day work week. I will tell you, to give three days full days off a week in this industry, it\u2019s unheard of.  \nEveryone\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, how did you pull that off?\u201d It\u2019s very interesting. I found some weird dynamics. How I was able to do it is I found out I actually have more people here during a longer period of time than trying to break everybody up over an amount of time. It was very interesting, so the coverage is actually more, and I have more time off for my team. We don\u2019t go, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s the last week of the month. Guess what? I need everyone here bell to bell.\u201d We don\u2019t do that either. We don\u2019t do any of the old traditional things. I mean, as a matter of fact, I\u2019ve tried to break every single old mold possible. Even with pay plans where even my managers and my salespeople, I\u2019m super transparent. We\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to pay everybody on every last red cent. Hold back, FNI, packs, docs, hidden packs, hidden docs.\u201d",

But had 3 separate shift types. 1st and 2nd shift shared these types while 3rd was different.\n\n1a or 2a was sunday to wednesday. 1b or 2b was Wednesday to Saturday. And 1 or 2 without the a or b signifier worked monday tuesday thursday friday.\n\n3rd shift however worked friday to monday.\n\nThis allowed our shift to effectively overlap on harsh days and prevent excessive overtime. No one had to stay past their 10 hours because someone was already there to touch what you didn't finish.\n\nIf we ever did overtime it was just an extra 10 hour day. Mandatories were few and far between but voluntary OT was always on the table if anyone wanted it.",

Thousands of qualified candidates getting canned and replaced with less experienced resources who don\u2019t have the leverage they did before to ask for things like this. Seems like a great business model in 2020 but executives are now showing their true colors and all the lip service about work life balance and flexible location/hours is no longer needed to attract talent.

Plus, if you're a founder who's thinking about the long-term viability of your company, doing difficult work that requires a happy team that works well together and understands the long history of the product, then even in a soft market you can't quite afford to treat your workers like interchangeable cogs.

SMEs will likely use this as a competitive advantage before larger organisations\n2. There is growing governmental interest - i've spoken to 15 ministries in the last three months, many considering national pilot programmes, and often not for the reason of productivity, but to answer more global issues facing countries in areas such as sustainability, equity, and mental health \n3. Gen Z are definitely a fundamentally different generation and because the 'american dream' is over for many, they're looking at work in a different lens to other generations\n\nWe JUST got insights into the first pilot group who are a year in to the trial - and the results are looking very good. Hope to have more news to share about this in the coming month. Otherwise, Unilever, Microsoft are good large company examples at present - and from the clients we're on boarding to the 4 day week at the moment, we're seeing some pretty big movement makers trialling this in the coming year - which will create a new type of competitive pressure for many organisations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, trade unions are increasingly adopting this as a key policy negotiation for the future - because unlike salary, time remains constant irrespective of the economy.",

The practice is controversial, as it often requires parents to come up with another day of child care, and the impact on test scores or learning is mixed (some studies say there's no impact, some claim there's a negative effect). However, the United Arab Emirates launched its 4.5 day week for the public sector and schools in 2022, and schools there have used it more as an opportunity to introduce experiential learning and other experiments; the fact that plenty of parents are on the same schedule really helps as well.",

Just in case though here is what I wrote:\n\nI would love to hear your take on differently set up work schedules, especially the ones in the shipping industry. \n\nTo shortly sum it up most people in the industry work on a ship for months at a time with months at a time at home afterwards. I personally have a quite good contract with 6 weeks on board and 6 weeks at home (while on board with two 6h shifts each day plus overtimes). Other companies have contracts for their officers which stay 4 months on board with two 4h shifts + OT and 2 months at home. The ratings usually stay around 8 months on board and 2 at home (which I personally find awful) although they work \"normal\" 8h days + OT in a 5-6 day week. There are plenty of variations depending on the type of ships, regions and companies.\n\nHow do you think this compares to the 4 or 5 day week that people in normal businesses have? How do you factor in split-shifts and working away from home?\n\nIf you have any interest in this industry or other questions I would gladly help out in any way I can. Also I would like to mention that a 4 day work week would convince me to work on shore again so I love the work you guys are doing!",

If they work less hours, they will simply get less work done.  This is true for truck drivers, waitresses, nurses, dentists, cashiers, plumbers, and about 1000 other occupations.\n\nPlease explain how society will continue to function properly when 20% of the work that all these people do just isn't being done any more.  Where will we get all the new teachers and nurses and dentists and truck drivers and electricians.  Will we be importing them from other countries?\n\nAlso, what will happen when all these people are either making 20% less money, or when all the companies employing them have to raise their prices to make up for the fact that all these people are now doing 20% less work and they have to hire many more workers?",

The percentage of people who agreed with the statement, \"I have enough time to complete my work\" rose from 50% before the trial to 79% six months in-- even though the number of hours people were working dropped by 20%.\n\nWhat's going on here? Two important things, I think. First, you're seeing the benefits of greater efficiency: the 4-day week gives people a great incentive to find ways of working better, because those improvements go back to them in the form of shorter weeks. Second, I think it shows that people have a greater sense of control over their time, which translates into lower stress levels about work.",

In a few places the 4-day week has been killed off after a change in management or economic downturn, but the Hawthorne Effect seems to be a non-issue (so far at least), and companies do a few things to make the 4-day week something everyone earns, not something they're entitled to.",

The Chips and Fish example you gave in another comment for example. In other words, if the Company wants to keep a Status Quo rather than \"growing\". In that case, it could be possible to pay the same money for less hours and it's reasonable that productivity would \"stay the same\".  \nBut many people are greedy. They want more and more. They would not want people to do the same in less time. They would want people to do more in the same time.  \nWhy should these people adopt the 4 days system?  \nAnd, besides the \"make them see that it's good for the Company\" kind of argument, is there also an ethical talk about it? Like, \"it's not so important if it's better or the same or a little worse, it's just needed and it must happen because people can't spend their life working\"?",

Fatigue and burnout are significant productivity hindrances - and i think once leaders see the benefit of reducing burnout, through interventions like reduced working hours, they'll also see the benefits for their own businesses outcomes. This is very much - 'less is more' because our brain has a finite capacity. \n\nWe're trying to build 'high performance' but look at any sector where 'high performance' is expected e.g. elite sports, aviation etc. and you'll see the importance of rest and recovery in that equation.",

In Japan and Korea, for example, proponents of a 4-day week highlight that it would make it easier to start families while allowing women to stay in the workforce, which follows a bigger argument they've been having about population growth. And of course there's an ethical or philosophical argument to be made for the benefits of a shorter workweek, or greater respect for the value of leisure time (Tricia Hersey's recent REST IS RESISTANCE makes this case, though you can go back to Josef Pieper's LEISURE: THE BASIS OF CULTURE, or Aristotle). \n\nBut regardless of nationality, the business owners we talk to are all worried about the same things, and want the 4-day week for the same reasons. They certainly acknowledge the benefits of more free time, but they also have a fiduciary obligation to make it work.

They can work 8 hours a day 5 days a week , 10 hours a day 4 days a week , or a 9/80 schedule where they work 9 hours Mon - Thurs each week and take every other Friday off.\n\nWe could certainly get their work done with 8 less hours over a week.  I would hazard a guess they spend time looking at reddit , doing dishes etc but they deliver what I need when I need it so I'm not concerned.\n\nIt might not work for every field, it might require outside the box thinking where you have people staggered so that people get an extra day off but you always have the man power you need.\n\nYou know better than to think the whole world will magically instantly flip to the 4 day work week.

I also believe that you can't improve things without investing in the infrastructure to support it in the first place. Tech jobs (and many white collar jobs) have more access to that kind of infrastructure.\n\nThe majority of labor does not. Mainly because of the cost, complexity and quality, but there are other factors as well. It seems to me that if you want to improve the quality of life for human workers, you need to focus on each industry and role specifically and start mapping out their process to see what can be more efficient.\n\nThis is coming off like the other way around, setting an arbitrary goal without knowing what the measured opportunity is in the first place.\n\nYou can't improve what you don't measure.",

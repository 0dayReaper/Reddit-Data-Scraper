    "postText": "Canadian investigative news show, W5, recently broadcast a story about cosmetic limb-lengthening surgery. The episode centres on a 28-year-old patient who underwent the procedure and successfully grew from 5\u20199\u201d to 6\u20190\u201d. An increased number of men are undergoing the surgery, and I'm here with W5's Anne-Marie Mediwake, the reporter on the story, to give you insider-only information on the process of getting taller. \n\n**Edit: We are signing off, but we will monitor for new questions.

Do you require your patients to undergo any level of counseling prior to electing this procedure? Would someone need to speak with a therapist first about their insecurities and their plan, or would you operate on a patient who has explored no alternative forms of treatment for their dysphoria? \n\nTIA!",

Dr was arrogant to my husband\u2026 who gets along with everyone\u2026and talked over his polite questions.  Seeing is believing!

She also had lupus and was on pred for that.  She chose him, too.  At check up, she told him it still hurt. No diagnostics.  He told her to quit being a baby and sent her home.  After several months of that, she got a new doctor who ordered an X-ray to see why it still hurt.  It never knitted and she had two broken bones floating around.  She had to have her arm in a sling for a mother year but at least she got good care\n\nI hope someone sued him into the worst nursing home",

Follow up question, which is my wife's primary concern: How long is the recovery period from this before regular load bearing activities can be resumed? She spent most of a year in a wheelchair when she broke her leg and had to relearn how to walk again, she's not very keen on repeating that experience. This was all before the advent of the knee-scooter, so I'm assuming there wouldn't be nearly as much or any wheelchair time past the hospital stay.",

As you surely know, literature at this time does not delineate between height *treatment* versus *enhancement*. Where treatment allows for exploration of \"height dysphoria.\" As of now, \"height dysphoria\" is not a true pathology. \n\nIs it your position that there is no consideration necessary aside from your patients will to have the procedure and their pocket book? Do you conduct any screening for potential issues such as height dysphoria, or will you only take this into consideration when CMQ has something to say, and in the meantime, roll in cash?",

Subjecting a patient to massive bilateral boney work for cosmetic reasons should raise multiple ethical red flags for any surgeon, how do you justify such a huge risk profile against cosmetic benefit? Is the risk of losing both limbs to nonunion really worth it when the benefit is purely cosmetic?\n\nFor the record I am not totally against the surgery as a concept but to so flippantly dismiss the question of ethics is highly concerning. We don't abdicate our duty to the patient on the grounds of 'the patient wanted it so whatever', that's bad medicine.",

My question is: I'm assuming there is a period of rehabilitation after the surgery to get the surrounding musculature to accept and adapt to the new length of limb, what does this look like? Are the stretches similar to exercises one would do to improve general flexibility anyway or is there anything special that needs to happen to allow the muscles to adapt? Or does the body just take to it without much rehab required?\n\n\nAnd as a follow up question: if there is a period of stretching involved, do patients have the ability to further increase their flexibility, or is there a certain level that they can't progress? Would someone who was maybe considered flexible before the surgery lose a portion of flexibility due to the muscles now being permanently stretched?",

Once full weight bearing achieved and bone is healed, strengthening is increased.  Weight bearing during lengthening is at 70-80lbs per leg.

You'll hear quotes like \"electing a president not a saint.\"\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of speculation around the phenomenon of evangelicals enamored by Trump. In my opinion, the reason is just that evangelicalism has always been a power-centric, arrogant faith community. Even their view of God is very much about God\u2019s interest in power. It\u2019s just that now it\u2019s gotten to a tipping point. Their idea of \u201cservice\u201d to the world is converting other people to join their communities. They\u2019re not very service-oriented. If you look at all the moral causes they care about and aspects of morality, most of them are related to having power over someone else, not about service that requires you to humble yourself. So Trump had all the bravado and self-importance that they, whether they admit it or not, aspire to have. And they expected him to give them what they wanted policy-wise. They saw they were losing their grip on their wider culture and they needed some candidate to keep them going.",

I\u2019ve asked people about the hanging-out-with-sinners thing Jesus did and they usually say that Jesus\u2019 purpose in doing that was to reach people to save. Basically they interpret the mission of Jesus\u2019 life through a salvific lens and what someone must do in order to be saved. They think the stakes are so high for what could happen to other people if they don\u2019t do what they\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to do that they take on the role of disciplinarians and megaphone-holders to warn everyone.

One idea you discuss is that a certain number are dropping out of religious identity because churches have become more politically identified. This does seem likely, however, other material in your book seems to cut the other way. Namely, Black Protestant churches have always been very political and continue to be--so there's no change there. And yet, these churches also are seeing a drop in membership of similar proportions. To review, Black Protestant churches are neither more politically active than they were previously, neither is the political activism they do pursue of the conservative variety that is tagged by many with turning off at least marginal adherents. So, is it possible that the argument that politics is behind the shift merely coincidental? Thanks, Jim Robb",

That's true of Catholics and Protestants and LDS and Jews. \n\nBut when you look at voting patterns for non-white folks based on religious attendance, there is no pattern. Never attending Hispanics don't vote that much differently than Hispanics who attend every week. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/ryanburge/status/1633863039291379712\n\nI think for Black Protestants, it's not politics that is doing the driving. Although there is so weak evidence that high attending Black Protestants are drifting away from the Democrats a bit. \n\nBlack Protestants are leaving for a myriad of other reasons. \n\nIt's clearly a factor for white people, though. \n\nMaybe a post on my Substack forthcoming about this.",

                    "comment": "&gt;Why are so many religious figures pedo\u2019s and sexual abusers?\n\nI'm not the OP, but I don't think it's specifically a religious phenomenon. You see abusers finding positions with the Boy Scouts, with teachers, with athletics programs. It seems to come down to adults (or older youth), being put in a position of trust over children, being given inadequate supervision, and then the institution reacting to reports of abuse by protecting itself rather than protecting the children.\n\nA religious figure is just a very good example of someone whom a community would trust to be morally above such abusive behaviors, who would have a lot of power to threaten to use to keep kids quiet about their abuse, and who are part of an institution which has a vested interest in keeping such things quiet to retain a reputation of morality.\n\nAnd abusers recognize that and will gravitate to such positions.",

We write about what we are most familiar with. I grew up Southern Baptists. I understand evangelical culture from an insider's perspective. So it's much easier to write about. When I write about Hindus, I have to be super careful that I don't make rookie mistakes. \n\nBut the other reason is we just like big numbers. I'm a stats guy. Latter-day Saints are 1% of the population. For decades, surveys were never more than 3000. Which means you get 30 Mormons. Can't do much with that, statistically. But you would have 75% or more Christians. That's enough data to analyze. \n\nWrote about that in more detail: https://religionnews.com/2021/11/05/how-religious-is-your-average-22-year-old-a-new-golden-age-of-survey-data-opens-a-door/",

The Southern Baptist Convention says they expect to lose half their churches soon because as Barna Research shows, less than 4% of young adults believe in Satan, judgment or have a 'Biblical Worldview.'  The SBC says if you don't believe in Satan, you're not Christian.  So Roman Christianity depends on Satan for their theology to survive. That's what's killing the church.  'Nones?'... Parade Magazine did a poll in 2009 finding that 24% have left church rejecting brimstone oppression for \"Spiritualism.\"  This being an open ended personal belief system free of brimstone fear, where most believe in the contemporary 'Near Death Experience,' secular revelation where all go into a blissful, serene afterlife... Much more positive that the scary church judgment scenario.  SBC is trying to squash the NDE from many Baptists who believe it, saying it's \"antithetical\" to biblical judgment.  You're going to have a tough uphill battle against this rising 'Spiritualism/Nonism.'",

    "postText": "I have been a professional private jet pilot for roughly 15 years. I hold an ATP (Airline Transport Pilot) license, and type ratings in the the CE-500 (Citation 500 series), CE-525 (Citation CJ series), and the EMB-550 (Embraer Legacy 500 / Praetor 600). I also fly the Pilatus PC-12NGX which is a single engine turbo prop.\n\nThe largest jet I currently fly has a range of 4,000 nm and can carry around 9 passengers. The purchase price was $23MM. This aircraft can make the west coast to Hawaii, and NY to London non-stop.\n\nI have spent time in the sales office selling what we call \"Charters\" (one time jet rental flights), as a full time charter line captain, and now Chief Pilot and Dir of Flight Operations for a private flight department.\n\nI have flown a fair number of high profile people, as well as lesser known but wealthier individuals.",

Unfortunately it's a very fractured model with many small operators and they may post empty legs on their individual websites but it doesn't necessarily feed to a central site. You may be best suited to find what local operators live in your area and see if they post them on their website.",

One of my fave passengers when I flew charters was a well known football player for the Chicago Bears whom has since retired. I used to fly him to Vegas and he would tip $1k without fail. Other perks are things like collecting hotel rewards points. I stay at Marriott properties and built up enough status and points that all of my personal vacations are free. The same is true for rental cars. Not to mention when a passenger goes to a cool destination, I am there enjoying it as we typically stay nearby in case they want to go home early. So if they are in Iceland for a week, so am I, and they are paying for everything.",

In all honestly they shouldn't be flying but no one along the way can stop them or they'll just pay another guy to help them out. On the flip side a large corporate flight department or large charter company can have a safety culture that is on-par with the top airlines. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the most part it's a different career path, but some private jet operators don't treat their pilots well and they make the jump to airline.

Since we are significantly lighter than airliners, we have better thrust to weight ratios which allow us to get higher, then we need to carry less fuel for the same route amongst other benefits such as weather, turbulence, direct routing etc... Really it just comes down to the fact we are lighter such that engines can be sized enough to provide the proper thrust. On a 737 to get to 45,000 with a full load of fuel and passengers the engines would have to be the size of the fuselage.",

One of the jets I fly is 9.5 PSI which puts our cabin at around 4,500 ft when flying at 43,000 ft. Some airliners are at a cabin of 6,000 ft at 35,000 ft. The size probably plays into it but I can't say for sure. It's probably easier to build a more robust pressure vessel when it's dimensionally smaller. As for service life, we never get to the hours an airline does before the engines and everything else go obsolete well before the fuselage.",

You need at least 40 hours for your private license and most people require a little more, figure another 20-40 on ground school. To get to the point you are hirable, you may end up having something like 750 hours and all of your licenses in order. The costs can be into the 6 figures when it's all said and done, but many people try to offset by instructing. Also the GI bill can pay for the majority of your flight training if you were ever in the military.

I was by far the youngest guy in class at my first jet type rating class as I was 28 at that time and had already been flying other non-jets on a professional basis since I left college. \n\nIt's tough to say if there is a too late age. Really it depends on your ability to learn new material. With the pilot shortage going on right now, I know some private operators hiring very old pilots (as in over 65 and even 70). While airlines have a mandatory retirement age of 65, you can fly in private aviation beyond that with some limitations such as certain international destinations such as Mexico that does not allow older pilots.",

Originally I had thought a loss of pressurization with everyone passing out and the aircraft going down at fuel starvation but that doesn't explain the course changes. I have heard a number of theories and none of them seem to be the perfect fit to me.",

Then I dropped the \"oh by the way I'm a pilot\" and managed to get some right seat legs and grew from there. That was during a very rough time for upcoming pilots though. These days, you are in a fantastic position to quickly find whatever flying job you want. Every single charter and fractional operator is in need of pilots. I would suggest to try and fly complex twins as much as you can, and ask anyone at your airport with a turboprop or light jet if they ever need a co pilot to give you a shot, even if the first few flights are unpaid.",

The tracks are then spaced laterally by a certain number of miles. Once we coast out, we are assigned a speed that is the same speed as the aircraft in front of us. By being say 50 miles behind them and at the same speed, we should never encroach. We then have aircraft at each even altitude in one direction and odd in the other making at least 1,000 ft of vertical spacing. We then have to do position reports at each fix to verify we are still at that prescribed distance, we can do this either by HF radio or now we have the ability to do it via a text messaging system called CPDLC that works via satellite.",

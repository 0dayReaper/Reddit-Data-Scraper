    "postText": "Hello fellow Redditors - I'm the torso with an occasionally-visible head named Andrew Rea, but you might know me by my arbitrarily-chosen pseudonym, Oliver Babish.  He was a character on The West Wing.  Played by Oliver Platt?  He was in like 8 episodes?  It doesn't matter.\n \nMy second cookbook, The Binging with Babish companion cookbook, hits shelves and slides into your DM's (domestic mail's) today - it's got the first hundred recipes from the show, good and bad, terrible and wonderful, for your consideration and recreation.  I started out posting pretty pictures of my various dinners to /r/food, and eventually had the idea to make what I called a \"moving-picture\" (I've since learned that this is called a video) of my food, and share it on this community.  This was the first episode of Binging with Babish, the show where I recreate foods from movies and television.  Three and a half years later, and I'm making all different kinds of shows, getting to be a guest on Hot Ones (shout out /u/seanseaevans), buying my brother his dream car, opening a brewpub in Brooklyn, and dropping my second cookbook.  I've said this many times before, but I owe my career and wonderful new life to the Reddit community, who helped spread the word about my show in /r/videos, /r/cooking, and /r/food.  My channel is one of the countless examples of how content creation and creativity are being slowly democratized, and how almost anyone, anywhere, with little more than a camera and an internet connection, can potentially have their voice heard by millions.  It's not something I ever imagined for myself, and as I say in my book: I will spend the rest of my life working to earn everything you've given me.\n\nAnywho before I get all weepy, let's get to it!  AMA!!\n\nEDIT: I should probably mention that I'm going on my nationwide book tour starting today!  [Git your tix here](https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/events)!\n\nEDIT 2: Guys I'm so sorry I gotta run!  I will keep answering questions piecemeal in my downtime tonight, but tonight is [the book event in Philly](https://concerts1.livenation.com/event/020057241808C9C5) - there's still tickets left, I'd love to see you there!  Thank you all so much for the amazing questions, the kind words, and for supporting the channel!!\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/mvtvqa1nbyt31.png",

Stainless steel pans, enameled cast iron, knives, stand mixers!",

Babies are the greatest scientists of all, and they learn new things every day. Most third graders love space, or dinosaurs, or bugs, or any number of things they can learn new facts about every day.\n\nThe key to not losing that interest is to never stop asking \"Why\". There is always an answer to the question \"Why\", even if nobody knows that answer. \n\nBeing a scientist is finding the answer. Even if many people already know the answer like \"Why is the sky blue?\" Finding out makes you a scientist.\n\nSo, to maybe bring this lesson home, a extra credit assignment could be to ask all your kids to write down a question *they* want an answer for. Don't worry too much about if the questions they ask is of a scientific nature, it could be history, it doesn't really matter, what matters is the journey of learning on their own.\n\nThey only need a couple of sentences to make it worthwhile, the format could be:\n\nQuestion: Why is the sky blue?\n\nResearch: I asked my mom.\n\nAnswer: There's blue light in sunshine, and it gets spread out all over the sky by the air.\n\nFollow up question: Why does only blue spread and not the rest of the colors?",

I live on Maryland's Eastern Shore, and I am related to a lot of watermen (fishermen who make their living pulling crabs and oysters from the Chesapeake Bay).  Do you know who the biggest opponents are to Chesapeake Bay conservation efforts?  Watermen.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, I don't think it's a question of education -- in their own lifetimes, these men have seen a dramatic decrease in oyster and crab populations.  But they will fight tooth and nail against any efforts to limit catch sizes, even when presented with overwhelming evidence that those limits are necessary to prevent the extinction of the species they rely on for their livelihood.  They would literally fish the last crab or oyster out of the Bay.\n\nAnd this is the best case scenario -- people who have a vested interest in maintaining populations in the Bay.  I can't imagine how you reach, say, farmers, whose fertilizer and pesticide usage also negatively impacts the Bay ecosystem.  They don't have any incentive to change -- unless they like oysters, I guess.",

To what extent do you envisage automation replacing common jobs anytime soon, on a large scale? If this is accomplished do you think it will be a current player (amazon/google/tesla), something completely left-field no one expected, or a community effort from thousands of small to medium sized enterprises working together?

What scientific mystery do you most want to solve?\t|\t[Here](\thttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/66ajul/i_am_bill_nye_and_im_here_to_dare_i_say_it_save/dggxvhb/?context=3\t)\nActually, I have a big question for you! I'm sure you still very clearly remember your debate with creationist Ken Ham. I'm a Christian, but personally do not agree with his views on creation. I'm more of a Christian scientist in that I chalk up the creativity of science to God. He's responsible for the Big Bang billions of years ago, he's responsible for the creativity behind evolution, and all of the stuff that makes science so awesome are like his fingerprints. Now you, as the awesome scientist that you are, do you think that there is any room in science for that line of thinking? Has it ever crossed your mind that there may be a higher power at work? I won't take offense at your answer.\t|\t[Here](\thttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/66ajul/i_am_bill_nye_and_im_here_to_dare_i_say_it_save/dggy9um/?context=3\t)\nCan you please run for president?\t|\t[Here](\thttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/66ajul/i_am_bill_nye_and_im_here_to_dare_i_say_it_save/dggylgc/?context=3\t)\nHey Bill, What are your thoughts on animal agriculture and the promotion of a vegan diet as to reduce our impact on climate change?\t|\t[Here](\thttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/66ajul/i_am_bill_nye_and_im_here_to_dare_i_say_it_save/dggyrvv/?context=3\t)\nBill, What are your thoughts on Elon Musk and what he is doing for the scientific world through Tesla and SpaceX?\t|\t[Here](\thttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/66ajul/i_am_bill_nye_and_im_here_to_dare_i_say_it_save/dggz02j/?context=3\t)\nWhere do you shop for ties?

My AAAS membership led me to the IDP Career Test at ScienceCareers.org. I am 27 years old and am finally considering a college education. My top result is \"Science Education for non-scientists\" of which I believe you have ample experience. How would you suggest entering this career field? Would any specific college major help or will any science based major suffice? Would you ever consider letting an individual, such as myself, job shadow you for a couple days? Lastly, do you plan to attend this year's StarTalk Saturnalia party? I'm also a member of the Planetary Society and have to thank you and your team for your science advocacy! I look forward to watching \"Bill Nye Saves the World\"; keep up the great work! Bonus Question: Have you heard of \"The Show About Science\" Podcast run by 6 year old (Yes only 6!) Nate Butkus? I would love to hear you interviewed on his show!

I agree to an extent - science should not be a political issue as it is really just our best gauge of reality. \n\nHowever, in recent decades, science has been under attack and forced into being a political issue. It is not our choice whether or not this happens, it's happened already.\n\nOur best course of action is to defend science since it is constantly under attack by ignorance, closed-mindedness, and bull-headed paranoia. It's very important that we defend science.",

Nye and Tyson and others basically just gave their thoughts when the story broke and was in its firestorm stage. It wasn't sound scientific commentary.

My top result is \"Science Education for non-scientists\" of which I believe you have ample experience. How would you suggest entering this career field? Would any specific college major help or will any science based major suffice? Would you ever consider letting an individual, such as myself, job shadow you for a couple days? Lastly, do you plan to attend this year's StarTalk Saturnalia party? I'm also a member of the Planetary Society and have to thank you and your team for your science advocacy! I look forward to watching \"Bill Nye Saves the World\"; keep up the great work!\n\nBonus Question: Have you heard of \"The Show About Science\" Podcast run by 6 year old (Yes only 6!) Nate Butkus? I would love to hear you interviewed on his show! You have been an inspiration since my youth; I know you'd inspire him also.",

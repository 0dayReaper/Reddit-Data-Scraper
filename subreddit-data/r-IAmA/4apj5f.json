    "postText": "Hi Reddit, I\u2019m Steve Wozniak.\n\nI will be participating in a Reddit AMA to answer any and all questions. I promise to answer all questions honestly, in totally open fashion, even when the answer is that I don\u2019t have an answer to a specific question or that I don\u2019t know enough to answer it. \n\nI recently shot an interview with Reddit as part of their new series **Formative**, in which I talk about the early days of Apple. You can watch it here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrhmepZlCWY\n\nThe founding of Apple is often greatly misunderstood. I like clearing the air about those times. I like to talk about my ideas for entrepreneurs with humble starts, like we had. I have always cared deeply about youth and education, whether in or out of school. I fought being changed by Apple\u2019s success. I never sought wealth or power, and in fact evaded it. I was able to finish my degree in EE&amp;CS and to fulfill a lifelong goal to teach 5th graders (8 years, up to teaching 7 days a week, public schools, no press allowed). I try to reach audiences of high school and college and slightly beyond people because of how important those times were in my own development. What I taught was less important than motivating students to learn. Nothing can stop them in that case.\n\nI\u2019m still a gadgeteer at heart. I buy a lot of prominent gadgets, including different platforms of computers and mobile devices, because everything different excites me. I think about what I like and dislike about such things. I think about the course technology has taken since early PC days and what that implies about the future. I think often about possible negative aspects of what we\u2019ve brought to the world. I try to develop totally independent ideas about a lot of things that are never heard in other places. That was my design style too.\n\nI admire good engineers and teachers greatly, even though they are not treated as royalty or paid a fraction of other professions. I try to be a very middle level person and to live my life around normal fun people. I do many things to affect that I don\u2019t consider myself more important than anyone else. I had my lifetime philosophies down by around age 20 and I am thankful for them. I never needed something like Apple to be happy.\n\nFinally, I\u2019m hosting the Silicon Valley Comic Con this weekend March 18 - 19th, so come check it out.  You can buy tickets [here](https://register.growtix.com/e/silicon_valley_comic_con). \n\nSteve Wozniak and Friends present Silicon Valley Comic Con\n\nhttp://svcomiccon.com/?gclid=CMqVlMS-xMsCFZFcfgodV9oDmw\n\nProof: http://imgur.com/zYE5Asn\n\nMore Proof: https://twitter.com/stevewoz/status/709983161212600321\n\n*Edit\n\nI'd like to thank everyone who came in with questions for this AMA. It was delightful to hear the questions and answer them, but I also enjoyed hearing all your little screen names. Some of those I wanted to comment on being very creative. I always like things that have a little bit of humor and fun and entertainment built into the productivity work of our lives.",

He is continuing a strong tradition that Steve Jobs was known for of making good products that help people do things they want to do in their life, and not taking the company into roads of, \"Oh, we'll make all our money like by knowing you and advertising to you.\u201d We'll make good products. And you know, I started out as a hardware product guy, so I'm glad to see that. \n\nI worry a little bit about - I mean I love my Apple Watch, but - it's taken us into a jewelry market where you're going to buy a watch between $500 or $1100 based on how important you think you are as a person. The only difference is the band in all those watches. Twenty watches from $500 to $1100. The band's the only difference? Well this isn't the company that Apple was originally, or the company that really changed the world a lot. So it might be moving, but you've got to follow, you know. You've got to follow the paths of where the markets are. \n\nEverything else, I'm very approving of Tim Cook, because every time we have a new iOS update, I'm very happy that it's doing things that really affect people. Like transferring calls from my phone to my computer, etc. I really love even the Airplay, and all that. So, I love the software, and I love the hardware, and nothing's letting me down. So I approve very strongly of Tim Cook and the new Apple. I dearly miss Steve Jobs too, but, that's all.",

We did not have to modify our ways of living. So the human became very important to me. And how do you represent what humanity is?\n\nYou know what, I have things in my head, some very special people in my life that I don't talk about, that mean so much to me from the past. Those little things that I keep in my head are my little secrets. It's a part of my important world, my whole essence of my being. I also believe in honesty. If you tell somebody, \"I am not snooping on you,\" or, \"I am giving you some level of privacy; I will not look in your drawers,\" then you should keep your word and be honest. And I always try to avoid being a snoop myself, and it's rare in time that we can look back and say, \"How should humans be treated?\" Not, \"How can the police run everything?\" \n\nI was brought up in a time when communist Russia under Stalin was thought to be, everybody is spied on, everybody is looked into, every little thing can get you secretly thrown into prison. And, no. We had our Bill of Rights. And it's just dear to me. The Bill of Rights says some bad people won't do certain bad things because we're protecting humans to live as humans. \n\nSo, I come from the side of personal liberties. But there are also other problems. Twice in my life I wrote things that could have been viruses. I threw away every bit of source code. I just got a chill inside. These are dangerous, dangerous things, and if some code gets written in an Apple product that lets people in, bad people are going to find their way to it, very likely. ",

Sure, I've got nothing to illegal to hide, but what about my personal opinions/artistic works that are incomplete, etc? It's nobody's business but mine who my friends are, what my bank statements say, what I discuss with my friends, where and when I'm leaving on vacation, etc. I'll let them dig through my computer, phone, what ever, when they'll let me do the same with theirs totally unfiltered.

No I would only say one thing, I am Apple. \n\nWhen I left in '85, the same as when I left in '81, I actually remained an employee on a slight payroll. I had a letter from apple wishing me luck. I sat on a blackboard and showed them what my intent was to go and create as a product, and there was absolutely no conflict. I like to live a life where kinda everyone likes me. I'm just not bad. If somebody is bad to me, I'm still good to them. \n\nSomehow I grew up with these values that seem kind of incredible, so I always was on good terms with Apple and they always liked me, I'm always welcome. I could come by, Steve Jobs would always make sure I had a badge that could get me into any building. I didn't use it much, but I can go there. The only trouble is I'll get mobbed. ",

And I do not carry around my phone answering every text message instantly. I am not one of those people. \n\nI wait until I'm alone in my places and get on my computer and do things where I think I'm more efficient. I really see a lot of people that are dragged into it, but you know, I don't criticize them. When you have change, it's not that the change in how people are behaving different to you is bad or good, it\u2019s just different. \n\nSo that's sort of the modern way, and you know the millennials, every generation wants to criticize the next generation for missing out on things like personal human contact, but I'll tell you a little story. When we started Apple, Steve Jobs and I talked about how we wanted to make blind people as equal and capable as sighted people, and you'd have to say we succeeded when you look at all the people walking down the sidewalk looking down at something in their hands and totally oblivious to everything around them!

They started rooting way back in the early days of flashing using the Android SDK, which was incredibly easy for them as they are both proficient linux users and comfortable with using commands rather than a graphical interface. \n\nIt went through a rough stage of being done on the phones using clockworkmod recovery (at which stage I had to help because there was no option to enable speech at the recovery stage. They'd download the rom and I would put the phone in recovery, install the rom, wipe cache, system and data, restart, sign into Gmail, re-enable talkback.) \n\nNow it's better because it can all be done by TWRP before the whole process starts (i.e they select a rom to install, check the boxes to wipe system, cache and data, then the phone restarts and TWRP does the rest with no user input while the phone is compromised speech wise). Then, once I've signed them into their Gmail accounts, their speech programs automatically resume and everything's done. Minimal intervention on my part and they get to play around with nightlies and such. It's great. ",

The last time I tinkered was to build a little Segway key burner where I could twist some dials, set my own speed codes on it, and tell the segway how fast it was allowed to go. \n\nI keep my soldering iron and tools handy, but I have such a busy life; public speaking, I'm with a company that's working on storage and data centers, I'm putting on Comic Cons. Such a busy life, it's hard to get the time to tinker, but I admire the young people and my older friends who do that. I just admire them so greatly. It's really where the great future products are going to come from. \n\nI think it's much less important to get somebody who has PhDs in all these subjects. If you can find somebody who never went to college but has built a lot of things as a tinkerer -  knows how to operate the equipment, run into their own little garage or laboratory quickly and whip something out - that's the person that companies are missing out on, and all their requisition requirements overlook those people.\n\nI can admire the tinkerers.",

Their friends just start calling them that. My uncle is Uncle Woz. My son, his friends call him Woz, and I turn to my kid and I realize they\u2019re talking to Gary instead. So it goes back. It's just nice. \n\nI like short simple things in technology, so I like shortening my name, I like shortening my signature.

So, I didn't even have obstacles of, *how am I going to get a good job or do these things?* \n\nCertainly in my early design days, I sometimes tackled problems that I didn't know if it was possible to solve, but when I'd get there I'd try to look for a solution, and somehow I always found it. Magic was pouring out of me, back in those days. \n\nIn later times, well, I've had divorces. So I guess you could say those are obstacles in life that I regret. But sometimes you grow up with a geekish personality that isn't really very social, and I dunno, you wind up in places you shouldn't have been. \n\nLet's see, other obstacles...I described one earlier about a product I was trying to make, to locate things like pets and cars and briefcases. The obstacles that I ran into were whether I could come up with some magic ideas. And I did come up with at least one magic idea, but it didn't achieve the results I wanted in terms of price, power usage, and size. \n\nBasically I think obstacles do a lot with dealing with people, and I work very independently, as far as I can, and then turn it over to others in very complete forms. So I didn't have a lot of the obstacles some people would talk about. \n\nObviously in business, we ran into obstacles at Apple. We all believed so much in doing the right thing, and building the Macintosh for the future rather than keeping with the dumb old computers of the past, and trying to achieve the world market. You know, holding our percentage of the world market as it grew ten times. We let Microsoft have all that growth, because we believed in doing the right things. Would you ever look back and say you regretted it or it was an obstacle? No. It was something we had to work hard to finally build a Macintosh market, and get our company back. But, we did the right thing. ",

I actually do dream up devices that would be cool all the time, and I don't really form a list that I'm working on in my memory. I just keep them inside of me and they come up when they're needed. Usually I'm looking for an underlying technology developed by physics people and chemistry people on a new type of chip that didn't exist before that makes something possible that wasn't possible before. \n\nI had a start-up company to make a little device that would be very low cost, you know like $30 in the grocery store, and you could just pop in anywhere and the battery would last for a year and it would be a little detection device that would notify you if your dog got out of the fence at home, or where your car is located if you forget, and I failed. I failed on technology grounds of cost, size, and the amount of power usage. \n\nBut I swear to god, I just keep thinking all the time about the technology advances that would have to be done to make that device possible. So maybe I'll even get back to it someday.",

So really, our computers are anonymous. They're out there somewhere, and who knows what their safety and security level is. We didn't even have to think about that. \n\nAlmost every time a technology is brand new, it leaves security as a later concern. Look at the phone system in the United States. When I was young, you could put tones into a United States phone if you learned about \"phone phreaking,\" and you could cause calls to be dialed for free anywhere in the world.

I love putting mine on and watching a basketball game live; it was just an experience that you can't believe. Sometimes I come out of a VR world, take off the helmet, and I can't believe I'm actually sitting in my office, at a desk at home. So, that's one of the big ones. \n\nRight now, Amazon Echo; it's getting so popular among the people that use it and they speak so highly of it, and it's so inexpensive. I see a lot of developers that went into smartphones jumping onto that. It's a platform, and when you have a platform that everybody else is writing apps for and connecting to, basically they're advertising your company as much as you are. \n\nObviously, I'm very interested in the evolution of self-driving cars. Right now, the assist that they give you for keeping in your lane and cruise control...the cruise control started back in 2004 actually, adjusting your distance. I love driving my Tesla so much, I just smile! I sit there in the driver's seat, and I kinda look over at my wife, and I just smile. I'm so happy, not using my hands or feet. So, I think the progression towards self-driving cars is going to be a good one. But it falls into that category of AI.\n\nNow, the AI that impresses me, I fell in love 10 years ago - well not 10 years ago, but whenever it started; Siri was an app you could buy for the iPhone, and I bought it. And for one year, Apple didn't have it. I just spoke of it as the app that changed my life, because I get to live as a human, saying things out of my head the way I would to another human, and a machine understands me. And I have wanted that to be the future for...forever. \n\nActually, ever since our Newton message pad, where I could type in, \"Sara, dentist, Tuesday, 2 PM,\" and click the assist button, and it would open up the calendar; Tuesday at 2 PM, it would put the word *dentist*, and it would grab *Sara* out of my contact list. I hand wrote with my own muscles a message for myself, for a human, and a machine understood me. So, I want that to get better and better; machines understanding what we mean, so that we can eventually communicate with them as our best, most trusted friends that know our own hearts and souls better than other humans.

If you've been good the year before, you're more likely to do very well the next year. When I was in college though, I was actually rather unfocused. I had my own loves in my life that were not taught. All the way through school we had nothing about computers. No books in bookstores, not even magazines, and that was the passion of my life. \n\nSo I stumbled into things by accident, and I'm very thankful for all those accidents. But I tended to get an idea in my head, and I'd just want to go off in that direction and do it. A focused student is someone who does all the right homework and gets all the right grades and they answer all the questions the same as somebody else that's called smart, you know. And I don't know, I always wanted to be in a different world, think differently. So I wasn't all that focused.\n\nI just kept building things for the fun of it, and I wasn't worried about I've got to meet some specs to have a company that makes money. So I'm very thankful I had a great friend who was always after having companies and money and turning things into more, and that was Steve Jobs.",

I didn't want to seek wealth and power, because in my mind it often corrupts people, and I didn't want to be that person who runs a company. The first time I left Apple was an odd accident. I had a plane crash as a pilot. I didn't come out of an amnesia state for five weeks where I didn't know time was passing. When I came out of the amnesia I realized that the Macintosh team (they were my favorite, most creative thinking team at Apple, and I was on that team), would be fine without me. \n\nSo I called up Steve Jobs and told him \"Macintosh team's in great shape, I'm gonna go back to college and get my degree.\" I had one year left to go. If I waited another year it would be too late to ever go back to college again actually. So I went back to Berkeley under the fake name Rocky Raccoon Clark, and that's what it says on my Berkeley diploma. That was the first time I left Apple. I came back and worked as an engineer. When the Macintosh project failed we had to recover with some Apple II projects, took us into the Apple IIGS to keep some money coming into the company for a while as we built the Macintosh market. And then I left the second time because I love startups. I love just a group of two or three or five people talking about an idea and going out and making it a reality. It may not be all the millions and billions of dollars in the world, but it's something you're doing yourself. The idea I came up with was for the first universal remote control, the CL 9 Core, so I left Apple to build that.",

I saw you speak in Orlando at the ASI Show last year. As a fan of Apple and moderator of /r/apple, I really enjoyed hearing about your personal relationship with Steve Jobs and how you were such a driving force behind the birth of the personal computer. Naturally, I was very disappointed at how little time you had on stage, so I\u2019m really looking forward to this AMA so I can hear more! So here\u2019s my chance to ask you the question I wanted to ask back then. Given that it\u2019s been about 10 years since the first iPhone, it makes you wonder what smartphones will be like in another 10 years. Where do you see smartphones going in the next decade? At this point, new features seem to be somewhat minor, so I\u2019m wondering if you have any insight on what form factors or major hardware features we might see in the not-so-necessarily-near future. Also, what kind of apple are you eating? Thanks so much for doing this AMA!\t|\t[Here](\thttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4apj5f/im_apple_cofounder_steve_wozniak_ask_me_anything/d12e4jz?context=3\t)\nSeeing as you're hosting a Comic Con... who's your favorite comic book character?\t|\t[Here](\thttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4apj5f/im_apple_cofounder_steve_wozniak_ask_me_anything/d12ebpe?context=3\t)\nWhat is the most funny prank that you've pulled?\t|\t[Here](\thttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4apj5f/im_apple_cofounder_steve_wozniak_ask_me_anything/d12emnj?context=3\t)\nSteve, As a wannabe 20 year old entrepreneur i look up to you and jobs as role models.

There are different months - right now I'm at the end of about 2 to 3 months worth - where I had mostly to myself, and that's wonderful, too. \n\nWhen I have free time, I like to go to all the normal entertainment things, go to the movies. My wife and I, oddly enough, maybe go to 50 concerts a year, and we almost always only go to the small little ones. We have to drive an hour to San Francisco to get to all the little small playrooms and music bars; tiny to medium-sized places. In the time I've known my wife, we've rarely, rarely - maybe only two times ever - gone to an arena concert, because everybody does that. I mean, thank god we went to the Springsteen one the other night, but that's rare rare rare. \n\nAnd we like movies, we like reading books, we like driving a ton. When you're home with short periods for vacation time, oh, we love our road trips so much, and audio books. We love listening to those together, or talking, or listening to music on the way. Fortunately we like the same things, and books, and music, and politics, and everything! ",

As a fan of Apple and moderator of /r/apple, I really enjoyed hearing about your personal relationship with Steve Jobs and how you were such a driving force behind the birth of the personal computer. Naturally, I was very disappointed  at how little time you had on stage, so I\u2019m really looking forward to this AMA so I can hear more!\n\nSo here\u2019s my chance to ask you the question I wanted to ask back then.\n\nGiven that it\u2019s been about 10 years since the first iPhone, it makes you wonder what smartphones will be like in another 10 years. Where do you see smartphones going in the next decade? At this point, new features seem to be somewhat minor, so I\u2019m wondering if you have any insight on what form factors or major hardware features we might see in the not-so-necessarily-near future.\n\nAlso, what kind of apple are you eating?\n\nThanks so much for doing this AMA!",

I like picking up my watch, and asking it to send a quick text to my wife, or using it for other things without having to pull the phone out of my pocket.\n\nOne of my favorites of all is the Amazon Echo, because I don't have to move or pull anything out of my pocket.

I don't remember where it was on the price scale... I think it's kinda towards the low end of all those watches. But I just love this little flexible magnetic bend. \n\nOf course, every once in awhile I'll put my hand on a table in a restaurant, and pull my hand back, and it pulls back the fork with me, that attaches to the magnet of the watch. That's kinda funny. \n\nThe evolution of personal computers, from the start on, usually when the changes got made, they got made in terms of input and output; the display resolution and how you signal your input. At first, you typed on a keyboard. Then, you got to go to a mouse where you could point at things as well. Now you can reach your hand out and drag things. So, the watch is just another evolution where basically about all you can do on it is talk and tap a little, but speaking into it commands it, and it's just closer to you. The input/output is closer to you, and easier to use. \n\nBut you know, I had some other smart watches, and I got turned off. One of them I kinda liked actually, called the Martian Watch. It was a very very simple one, but you could talk Siri commands into it. But I had the first Galaxy Gear, and after half a day, it just turned me off that it was separated; it felt between me and my phone. Whereas, the Apple Watch does some amazing things with Apple Pay, boarding passes for airplanes, and all the Siri commands that work. I do wish the speaker were louder.",

Wanting to do something. Having your own reason. And one of the things you should do is separate yourself off from the money. \n\nThere's a great quote that I came across from Russell Simmons \"Operate from a place of needing nothing. Needing nothing attracts everything.\" And I find that so true in so many places in life. Be willing to go out and build stuff that you like, even if it doesn't seem like it's a huge business success right away. Your learning from it will put you in the position to build those devices that someday in the future maybe have a major relevance on the world.\n\nOne thing is humility doesn't matter. You don't have to act like you have everything, know everything. Try and make common sense decisions, but look at Apple. The image of starting in a garage, as true and untrue as it isn't, it still represents the humility. You start at home, you're with your own friends, you guys are working for nothing, that's really exactly the same as how Apple started, and hopefully you're in a field that grows.",

Look at the size of the car market. Here we are at the turning point of cars, we might be heading towards replacing gas-driven cars with electric cars some day. Maybe Tesla is the first real star of realizing that the formula is the equivalent of gas stations on the highway for electric cars. So electric cars are coming and the self-driving cars with artificial intelligence, looking at everything and spotting stop signs.\n\nA couple months ago my wife got rear ended. Totaled actually, totaled in one of our cars, and the girl was crying from breaking up with her girlfriend and didn't see the red light. But if she'd been driving some kind of self-aware car, it would have stopped because of the red light. So I think that we're really going to improve life a lot with some of those things, and that's where Apple likes to be. Basically making products that make a better world for the users. So the car market makes total sense to me for Apple, but the important thing is that I hope if they get off on a product, something that they could sell and make a lot of money for but is not \"insanely great\" as Steve jobs would say, Apple should drop it and start over. \n\nAnd I think I read recently that some executives or some executive from Apple's car division left. Well, I think that's good if Apple says \"We're not making the product that is going to stimulate all of humanity, that's not our business as Apple. We don't want to just be another another electric car or self driving car,\u201d or whatever. So I'm really for that in Apple.",

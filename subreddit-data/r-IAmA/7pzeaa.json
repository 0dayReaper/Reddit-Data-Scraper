    "postText": "Hi Everyone!  I\u2019m FCC Commissioner [Jessica Rosenworcel](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/jessica-rosenworcel).  [I voted for net neutrality](https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/941361089387876352).  I believe you should be able to go where you want and do what you want online without your internet provider getting in the way.  And I\u2019m not done fighting for a fair and open internet.\n\nI\u2019m an impatient optimist who cares about expanding opportunity through technology.  That\u2019s because I believe the future belongs to the connected.  Whether it\u2019s completing homework; applying for college, finding that next job; or building the next great online service, community, or app, the internet touches every part of our lives.  \n\nSo ask me about how we can still save net neutrality.\nAsk me about the [fake comments](https://www.wired.com/story/fcc-must-investigate-fraud-before-voting-on-net-neutrality/) we saw in the net neutrality public record and what we need to do to ensure that going forward, the public has a real voice in Washington policymaking. \nAsk me about the [Homework Gap](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-338474A1.pdf)\u2014the 12 million kids who struggle with schoolwork because they don\u2019t have broadband at home.\nAsk me about efforts to support [local news](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-17-156A2.pdf) when media mergers are multiplying.  \nAsk me about [broadband deployment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/09/21/your-internet-isnt-getting-any-faster-but-the-government-might-soon-call-it-high-speed-anyway/?utm_term=.e96f4ccce280) and how [wireless airwaves](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/10/its-time-to-chart-a-course-for-5g-success/) may be invisible but they\u2019re some of the most important technology infrastructure we have.  \n\nEDIT: Online now. Ready for questions!\n\nEDIT: Thank you for joining me today. Hope to do this again soon!\n\n\n**My Proof:** https://imgur.com/a/aRHQf",

There are 34 million Americans without access to broadband at home, 23 million of them live in rural communities.  We need a plan to ensure that high-speed service reaches them where they live.  I think for starters we need to know today where service is and is not.  But right now the national broadband map is 3 years out of date.  Data that is three years old is like a lifetime in the internet age.  We need to fix this.  But I don't think that Washington should wait--we can begin by asking the public directly and using the wisdom of crowds.  To this end, I set up an e-mail address at the FCC to take in comments about where service is lacking and what can be done to improve it.  So please write in to broadbandfail@fcc.gov and let me know your stories.  You can be a part of fixing this infrastructure problem.",

But I'm a data engineer and web developer, and I'd be happy to put together a map and a dashboard to summarize the information you do get.\n\n\nI think this is a good idea because you really can't trust the data from the large broadband providers. I've been trying to get my parents set up with broadband for years, and they are not very far from a largish city in Texas. Verizon, ATT, and Time Warner all claim to offer service in the area, but every time I've tried to get them to set it up, they are all, \"Well, we can offer cell service and charge by the gigabyte. But we can't offer un-metered service by cable or fiber because that area isn't populous enough yet for it to be profitable.\" So they claim service is there, but it really isn't.\n\n\nI was recently able to get ATT to offer to lay down fiber to their house, but the price is $750/month for 20mbps up and down and they have to sign a 2-year contract at those rates.\n\n\nI think that a map of actual rates that people are actually paying along with the speeds they are getting for the price would be a good first step in identifying what the landscape really is.\n\n\nLet me know if there's any way I can help with this. Visualizing and summarizing the data you get from that email address is a good first step, but it's not a reasonable method to generate reliable results from. Polling is a challenge because it's specific information about something that doesn't exist that we're trying to find. Extrapolating based on statistics really wouldn't shed much light on this.\n\n\nBut it could be done. A short 5-8 question survey about broadband availability and price could be put together, and you'd need to get one completed survey for each of the ~44,000 zip codes in the U.S. to build a real map of what it's like out there. Then we can match those numbers to census data for demographic information (cutting down on the length of the survey). It would cost money to do this, but not as much as you might think.\n\n\nI'll gladly donate my time to this if we can work out an agreement about data security and properly anonymizing everything. Thank you for fighting for us on this.",

The American people are making known what they think about net neutrality and the future of the internet and they are letting Washington know in droves.  But at the same time we saw a lot of funny stuff in our proceeding.  There were about 2 million comments with stolen identities, half a million comments from Russian e-mails, and a lot of bogus comments from bots.  That's a problem.  I said so at the time and I called for a delay in our vote until we got to the bottom of this mess.  I wasn't alone.  Many members of Congress and state Attorneys General called for the agency to delay its vote and clear this up.  Unfortunately, the agency--over my objections--went ahead with the vote anyway.  But we still need to get to the bottom of what happened here, because fake comments are not unique to the FCC.  We're seeing them filed in other proceedings here in Washington at other agencies, including the Department of Labor and the CFPB.  ",

The fact that the grocer Aldi mostly only carries their own store brands and will not put products made by Nabisco or Keebler on the shelves is of no concern to me, because if I truly care about buying those products there are a large number of grocery stores that can gain my business.  In the same fashion if a fully neutral connection is important to me, given actual competition, there will be ISPs looking to earn business by making that offering without the need for regulation.\n\nOne of the fears is that ISPs will rate limit traffic which will negative impact competitors... like Netflix video suffering quality issues so a MSO like Comcast will be able to sell PPV movies instead.  But even if we mandate that all packets are treated equally, we won't permit queueing mechanisms other than for purposes of network management, we already have seen ISPs implementing data caps which influence consumer behavior.  All it takes is a 10 GB data cap and you'll see streaming video usage plummet.  \n\nThose of us who actually work on Internet backbones could also point out that if the ISPs want to treat all traffic equally such that there are no queueing mechanisms, policers or shapers, but they still want someone like Netflix to suffer, they simply just need to defer on upgrading certain paths to peers which Netflix uses for transit to that ISP.  Packetloss due to congestion is fair treatment and technically non-discriminatory, even though it could be in practice very discriminatory as those paying for settlement peering wouldn't see the same packetloss due to congestion across that shared path.  The neutrality rules as they were written do nothing to solve this problem other than suggest ISPs be transparent about congestion related issues.\n\nI'd also ask if neutrality had any real teeth, why was it that during the time in which the rules were in place nothing was done about Cogent refusing to route to Google's IPv6 network.  Sure Cogent isn't a residential provider, but it's been an issue for over a year and shows that a segmented Internet is possible even under the rules of neutrality by the FCC.\n\nComcast knows that it has captive eyeballs and wants to hold content providers hostage for this and it's all because the consumers have nowhere else to go.  Competition is the only real solution and instead of being a whitewash like neutrality, it actually provides a long term solution to all of the issues that I've discussed.  The FCC can make huge strides towards helping provide a competitive marketplace by pulling back on the spectrum auctions and giving the people back at least some of their EM spectrum for free use... the ISM bands are limited and crowded and the ones that have favorable propagation are too narrow for actual high speed data communications.  We can also look to countries like Japan and see how unbundling the last mile residential infrastructure actually works, where there are a number of ISPs competing for consumers and the consumers win.",

Its a long story but when I cancelled my contract and they realised that I wasn\u2019t coming back they did everything in their power to squeeze every cent possible. Between phone call charges(that they told me were free), doubling my final bill, adding extra charges and taking money out of my account for \u201cnot returning my internet box\u201d (in reality I had and had picture proof of it), i ended up paying an extra 100 euro that I have never gotten back. the only way they would return it was if I signed a new contract and that money would be taken out of my first few bills. \n\nSo my question is, as an EU citizen is there anything I can do to help fight the repeal for Net Neutrality, because if it passes there, theres every chance internet companies could fight to have it repealed in EU countries.

They bill me fair prices based on the amount of bandwidth I've actually used (95th percentile billing, etc.) and they are constantly upgrading their networks to offer additional capacity.\n\nIn contrast with my residential ISP: I only have three options, and all of them use different technologies, so if I make my selection based on technical criteria I really only have one provider that's even remotely viable for the work I do. (LTE Wireless vs. cable's DOCSIS vs. the telcos VDSL) -- My chosen ISP has offered me the same speed package for nearly 4 years with no upgrade path in sight, and another provider in my area imposes data caps (which don't even make sense as a method of congestion control.)\n\nAs a professional it's quite irritating to live in these two completely disparate worlds. At the datacenter my usage is metered and billed as such, just as my water or power at home are metered. The cost model matches the economic realities of the infrastructure, and it clearly makes transit providers enough money for them to fill the market with competition, expansion, and innovation.",

If you guys somehow came to the conclusion that your power over the internet wasn't enough to enforce basic net neutrality principals (despite the fact that you already were enforcing net neutrality principals), how does it stand to reason that the next step is the unlimited power you were granted in 2015 by reclassifying broadband providers as \"common carriers\"?

            "comment": "Question: one of the main problems with internet in America as I understand it, being from Sweden I might be wrong so feel free teen to enlighten me is the local monopoly on infrastructure in large parts of the country. \n\nThis is what enables cable companies (TV-Cable) to set ridiculous rates, limit trafic per month etc. \n\nTo what extent is the local and federal government building infrastructure and if not who is? I'm guessing private companies like VERIZON, AT&amp;T, and bell laboratories if I'm not mistaken. \n\nWhat are you doing to either incentvise these companies to build more infrastructure? How does the legislation look for small ISPs to be created by for example a suburban homeowners group to dug their own fiber to their houses and start providing internet access to the area?\n\nSweden is a bit different and I'm not saying it's all good but when the internet boom happened aprons the 2000 is and the move from phone based services like ISDN and DSL we had two things happen.  Each city built their own local fiber network, it was then connected to the national grid witch was largely built by scannova (former part of Telia) thus had massive government funding and I'm thinking that might not be something that happens in America.\n\nBut we also had several large networks rum by the largest ISPs.  They all understood the value of being able to connect to other isps networks so they created something called back finber.\n\nIt's essentially a network of fiber networks owned by several private entities that allows customers to choose any of the isps that are connected to the network regardless of who actually owns the network in your part of town. We didn't even have any laws about net neutrality until they where shoved at us by the EU a few years back, simply because they where not needed. The market solved the problem.\n\nSo how are you going to get companies to build this essential infrastructure of you are going to dictate to them how they are going to be able to capitalise on that investment?\n\nDo you see the danger in regulating the services to much that it night drive off investment? \n\nAnd what have you done to let people sort itself out by building their own networks. \n\nThank you.

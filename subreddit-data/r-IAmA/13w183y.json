I recently made a film \u2013 well, two actually \u2013 about Israel\u2019s  surveillance regime and how it uses technologies like facial recognition and artificial intelligence to control the lives of Palestinians under occupation.\n\nYou can watch both films on Youtube:\n\n - [Israel's automated occupation | The Listening Post](https://youtu.be/B1RNj8FXKqY)\n - [Inside Israel\u2019s surveillance machine | The Listening Post](https://youtu.be/FSCYbzqNM9w)\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for coming and asking thoughtful questions everyone.

Essentially, Palestinians are being enrolled in a database at checkpoints - without their consent - which governs their movement around the city. \n\nThese databases consist exclusively of Palestinians. Jewish Israelis - settlers included - do not have to contend with these forms of surveillance and control. \n\nAmnesty International's Matt Mahmoudi sums it up really well in the piece when he says: 'I don't think there's any point in history in which the creation of a database consisting exclusively of one ethnic or racialized group has ever led to any good outcomes.'  \n\n\n(edited for formatting)",

Few examples: Israelis IDs are biometric and are saved in centralized database that the government has access to. Part of processing requests fingerprints and high definition pictures of the person. \nCameras in cities exists everywhere, and controlled remotely. Following someone by face tracking alone, especially when there are more and more cameras in the big cities, is.. just simple tech at this point. They don\u2019t talk about it publicly but it is easy to do 1+1 in this case. \nCellphones are also tracked on request by police/military/etc, and is now known publicly as it been used to combat Covid by finding people that ignored the laws placed at the time.\n\nThis is just a part of what is being used by police, military and secret service, and known publicly in Israel. And as far as I know, there are countries with way more aggressive surveillance, like UK, China, USA, that does this and more. Hell.. there are private companies that go even further than that in their offices or with their laptops/workstations.",

The difference here is that surveillance is being used by an occupying power to control an occupied population. \n\nIn the second episode of the film, we spoke with a former Israeli intelligence officer in the elite Unit 8200. You might find what he told us instructive:\n\n\"The secrecy around 8200 and the intelligence community in general, helps it avoid public inspection. It has this image of only collecting information, only preventing terrorism and so on. Only diminishing violence, not in any way perpetuating it. But that's not true, as we know from other military regimes around the world. Intelligence is an integral part of a forced control over people.\"\n\nWhen I asked him how important surveillance was in sustaining Israel's occupation and apartheid practices, here's what he said:\n\n\"Crucial. Essential. Couldn't continue one day without intelligence. It\u2019s like a deteriorating situation where you have to use more and more force to keep the same level of control. So in the end, it's going to explode. I mean, it cannot keep going. There's a limit to the force you can use.\"",

Without the proper context, it'd be hard to tell how many of these were terrorist attacks. \n\nYou can clearly see that it worked, there's irrefutable proof. Especially if you compare to the 80s.\n\nIn a country that's struggling with cost of living and a shrinking middle class, we spend billions on surveillance. Anyone who is honest, will tell you that it works. No matter how unethical or controversial the west may think this is - we have significantly reduced casualties on both sides using AI and mass surveillance.",

But it presupposes that the main rationale for surveillance of Palestinians is to 'reduce violence.'\n\nWhat we saw was surveillance being used to control the lives of ordinary folks - people trying to get to work, people visiting family or trying to go to school. Their movement is being governed by an algorithm, in a database, in which they have been enlisted without their consent. A system operated by a soldier, in a military checkpoint, which has fragmented their community. All of this operating under a form of military rule that seems (to Palestinians) designed to protect settlers who are living in Palestinian homes illegally under international law.\n\nWhen you add it all up, you get the sense that surveillance is really about making life unbearable for people.",

A lot of the tech that private Israeli firms funnel to authoritarian states around the world have, in one way or another, been tested on Palestinians first. \n\nMany of the cameras being used in places like Hebron or East Jerusalem are made by international companies though.

It's expensive. Israel's middle class is shrinking, people are living paycheck to paycheck, and yet the consensus among the vast majority of Israelis and politicians is that we should keep investing in this tech. Why?\n\n2. **Was it effective preventing terrorist attacks?** Specifically, how many terrorist attacks have occurred which include the use of materials **which can be identified with video surveillance** like guns, grenades and suicide vests? How many before surveillance was introduced? How many after?\n\n3. **How many of these attacks would have occurred in a mixed neighborhood?** How many Palestinians were positively affected by these policies? How many lives were saved?\n\nYou can be factual in your reporting but dishonest all the same, and Al-Jazeera's bias is very obvious. I'd be very pleasantly surprised if you took the time to research these questions and come back for a third video.",

As we describe in the films, surveillance has been used to control indigenous Palestinians for more than a hundred years. Perhaps the more pertinent questions are: why does the occupation exist? Why do the majority of Israeli politicians continue to support what Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights orgs all call a system of apartheid?\n\n2/3) We would have liked to ask these questions to the Israeli military but they declined an interview.  As I mentioned elsewhere, even a former Israeli Major General with experience in the Occupied West Bank admitted to us that surveillance is as much about controlling Palestinians as it is \"fighting terrorism.\"",

A decrease in incidents is a better argument, but the fact that this level of servalience is necessary to maintain an unsteady peace in an apartied system is the real story here. We already know that heavy surveillance cuts down on transgressive behavior. That's obvious. Look at prisons. Should prison level servalience be directed specifically at a minority? That is the important concern here, and I don't think you should be surprised that it's the focus of the investigation.",

The Gazans burned it all down. Now they call Gaza an open air prison, but it was their own doing. They burned the crops, demolished the schools, and removed all they could, at a detriment to themselves. Just to hurt those who were evicted. \n\nTheir hate knows no bounds, and it comes at the expense of their own well being. I'm sure we disengaged today, this wouldn't have happened.

So while the Israelis saw Islamist political movements as a way to divide Palestinian nationalists between it and secular pan Arab socialists, they largely missed how Hamas was building an army and that unlike secular nationalists, religious extremists are much harder to infiltrate or negotiate with.",

Palestinians live under a two-tiered system of governance, which advances the rights and freedoms of Jewish Israelis, while denying those freedoms to Palestinians. This system has a name: Apartheid - according to a consensus of Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights orgs.\n\nNow, back to the rationale often used by the Israeli military - that surveillance is used for counter-terrorism. That's not what we saw while reporting in Hebron. It was more about reinforcing a system of control that for many ordinary people feels totally arbitrary.\n\nWe spoke to a former Israeli Major General who admitted as much. Surveillance, in his words, is as much about \"controlling them\" as it is \"fighting terrorism.\"",

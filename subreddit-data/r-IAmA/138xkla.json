    "postText": "Hey Reddit! I'm Hugh Howey, author of the self-published SILO series that releases today as a TV show on AppleTV!\n\nThis has been a WILD journey, and I've been sharing it here with you all over the last decade in a series of AMAs. The first one was after [my novel WOOL went gangbusters as a self-\npublished novel](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1a7jxd/i_am_hugh_howey_the_author_of_the_selfpublished/). Then I did one [as my writing career went to the next level](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1t8pgq/im_hugh_howey_the_author_of_the_wool_series_ask/). Two years ago [I did one after Apple and AMC announced WOOL was being greenlit for TV](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/nsallb/im_hugh_howey_the_author_of_wool_soon_to_be_a_tv/?sort=new). Over the last two years we've been writing, shooting, and editing ... and now the show lands today! The first two episodes, at least.\n\nAnything you've ever wanted to know about writing, publishing, adapting works to film, sailing around the world, how AI will make my job moot, the meaning of life, etc, fire away!\n\nTeaser for the TV show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBMajXwi6Cs\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/61B8zqG)!",

So many things get made that aren't as good as you hoped they'd be, and so the chances were good that this would happen to SILO. It was terrifying. I honestly was dreading today for a long time, thinking that the hype of \"what it could be\" would be better than \"here it is.\"  \n\n\nBut I was wrong. The show is amazing, and critics and fans alike are having a blast with it. But believe me, I was in knots for two years.",

That would make it almost impossible to shoot anything meaningful on them. And they would basically disappear on the screen.  \n\n\nMetal is better for the books. Concrete is better for the TV show.

Huge fan of Wool, and loving the series so far.\n\nInteresting to see how the storyline is starting to deviate between the series and the book (especially in episode 2!) Curious how you were involved in the TV adaptation and what you think of these changes to the plot. Does this new way of piecing the story together make you want to revisit some of the choices you made in the books?",

Usually, I was the one suggesting big changes and deviations, and Graham was like, \"Let's stick to the book.\" It was a great dynamic, because I've always been open to adapting for the new medium.  \n\n\nWOOL is so internal in much of the mystery. Lots of characters' thoughts, reading messages, digging into things in a non-physical way. We had to change that to make for gripping TV. For me, a straight up recreation almost never works well (compare the WATCHMAN film to the WATCHMAN TV show. The latter is SO MUCH better!).  \n\n\nFor ep 2, we were telling a story that doesn't take place in the books, really. It's just a line about an old case. So we had ultimate freedom.",

Definitely didn't think a publisher would be interested.  \n\n\nEven after it became a NYT bestseller, I turned down offers from all the major publishers. Just wasn't interested in their contracts.

In watching the first episode, however, it really made a lot of sense seeing the scale of the Silo. What was in your head as you were writing? Do you feel like the way it looks in the series matches what you imagined?",

I have such a bad memory that I can watch the same movie eight months later and enjoy it like it\u2019s new, but you wrote the Silo world so vividly that I can still virtually walk through it in my mind years after reading it. \n\nThat first chapter is probably the best opening of any series I\u2019ve ever read\u2014I tell people to just read the first chapter, and if they don\u2019t like it the rest of the book is not for them (I\u2019ve never encountered a person who didn\u2019t like it). \n\nI\u2019ve had a pet-theory about the name \u201cWool\u201d and I\u2019m wondering how off-the-mark I am:\n\nKnowing how it was self-published, I figured you named the story after the cloth they use to clean the camera lens; then the story got popular and you fleshed out the rest of the world, but kept the name \u201cWool\u201d to let those people know that this next bit is part of the same world. My head-cannon also has you regretting that you couldn\u2019t rename it \u201cSilo\u201d until it was too late?\n\nThanks again, and I\u2019m looking forward to what you do with the series!",

I used to write the word with the periods to denote this.\n\nThere's also an element of humans being like sheep that I had in mind and was an intentional and added bonus.\n\nI never thought of calling it \"Silo.\" The \"silo series\" was added much later.

Stayed up extra late after work last night to watch eps 1 &amp; 2. Totally worth it, loved them and can't wait for more. \n\nMy questions:   \n1. Did you get to be on-set for the production, and if so, how did it feel to see your silo come to life?\n\n2. Do you ever read the fan-written Silo stories? Do you have any favorites, and is there a possibility that any of those storylines or ideas will make it into the show?",

The first time I walked into the stair set I got very emotional. I caught it all on camera and hope to share it sometime. What's really nuts is meeting people dressed up and playing characters you invented. So weird! And amazing!\n\n2) I've been so supportive of the fan fiction, but I've avoided reading any of it, because I don't want to preclude myself from exploring similar themes. The other writers on the show have done the same thing. But for sure there will be overlap. It's difficult not to write some of the same beats and to see big similarities where there is nothing but coincidence.",

It's also 1 of only 2 sci-fi books that my wife has read, which I think is higher praise!\n\nMy question is what made you decide that Apple was the right fit for Wool? Did they offer you the most creative freedom?",

All three wanted the rights, and I was hiking around New Zealand weighing the pros and cons and taking calls with each. Apple hadn't launched their network yet, so they were a big unknown, but the passion was extraordinary. For me, it came down to them and AMC. I went with AMC, because of the relationships I was forming over the calls, the shared vision, and their storytelling excellence.\n\nApple never gave up. They asked AMC to partner up. I celebrated this, as it meant I got two out of my three top picks! We combined the storytelling brilliance of the folks at AMC with the huge support of Apple (who are also brilliant at crafting story and played a massive role here as well). It was the best of all possible worlds!",

I understand you were pleased with at least some of this.  \n\nOne of the ones that stuck out to me was an LGBT-themed story that featured a male protagonist and his male partner.  One of the issues they dealt with was homophobia in a closed system like a Silo, and what it means to be a non-breeding pair in an environment where breeding was controlled and genetic diversity was important.  I found it to be quite an interesting perspective, as I do not recall there being any LGBT content in the actual series.  \n\nIn the Television version of your series, will there be any exploration of this theme?  Or are we going to see an entirely heterosexual cast/100% LGBT-accepting universe?  \n\nFurther (and spoilers to follow), &gt;!what do you have against IT people!&lt;?    /s",

If I'd published this story today, there's a very good chance it wouldn't have been discovered.\n\nFacebook played a huge role in my early success, as I spent a lot of time there interacting with my first handful of readers. They became hundreds and then a thousand fans over time, and they really helped amplify my stories.\n\nI also kept writing and publishing at a furious pace. I aimed for 2-3 novels each year.

                    "comment": "Thank you so much for the kind words and the support. Means so much. &lt;3\n\nNow ... this is one of the most difficult questions anyone has ever asked me! I don't really like hyping my own works. I prefer to recommend the works of others. It just feels so icky to say \"this book of mine is awesome, here's why you should read it.\"\n\nThe other difficult thing is that I have so many different ways I could rank my works. How proud I am of them, how much I love the story, how easy or difficult it was to write, how much it changed my life or opened doors for me, etc.\n\nSo... instead of ranking the books by any metric, I'll list a handful of books and tell you which list of mine they would top. In other words, what these books mean to me more than any other book I've ever written.\n\nTHE WOOL OMNIBUS - This tops the \"book that changed my life\" list, and it's an easy choice. It hit the New York Times bestseller list as a self-pubbed work, getting all kinds of attention. It won awards. It got translated into over 40 languages, which sent me to countries I'd dreamed of visiting on someone else's dime. And it earned me more than I was making at my day job, so it's the book that turned me into a full-time writer. Very few books stay on shelves and continue to sell a year after release, and yet this book does it a decade later. It's insane to me how many doors this one work has opened up.\n\nMOLLY FYDE AND THE PARSONA RESCUE - This tops my \"I'm so proud of you\" list. I spent twenty years trying to write a novel and failing, giving up, shoving opening chapters aside. It wasn't until I came up with the character of Molly that I found a story I couldn't let go of. Finishing this novel was one of the greatest days of my life. It convinced me that I could be a writer.\n\nI, ZOMBIE - This book tops my \"I'm not a shitty writer\" list. It's my most literary work. It's the closest I'll ever get to writing something sublime. I hid my biggest writing effort inside the putrescence and foulness of diseased intestines because deep down I'm never going to allow myself to believe that I'm not a shitty writer.\n\nSHIFT - This books tops my \"I'm not scared of my own success list.\" The meteoric rise of WOOL terrified me. I was more comfortable writing for a small audience. When I set out to complete the trilogy, I made a deliberate decision to not string along the story from WOOL and just cash in on its success. I wanted to pivot in an unexpected way and, frankly, sabotage the success of WOOL if possible. Make sure that book stood on its own. The easy way to do this would've been to not write a sequel at all. But I challenged myself to write about how the world of WOOL came to be made, something that apocalyptic writers (rightly) avoid. I hear from so many people that SHIFT is their favorite book in the series, and this is the highest compliment to me. Even my agent loves this book the most.\n\nMACHINE LEARNING - I love short stories. I live for them. This collected work tops my \"Here's who I am laid bare\" list. It's got all of me in it, and that's so frightening. But I embrace it and am as proud of this work as I can be. It includes several short stories that top various other lists I could dream up, like THE WALK UP NAMELESS RIDGE and PEACE IN AMBER.",

I have added all of these to my reading list - expect for the Wool series, which I have already read.\n\nI LOVED the direction you took with SHIFT. One could compare it to tangent in episode 3 of the Last of Us, which many say is their favourite episode, except that SHIFT involves the main character more directly. You\u2019re a fantastic writer, but I don\u2019t think the series would have been as good if &gt;!it stayed in \u2018the\u2019 Silo!&lt;.",

Quite new story in ep. 2 to digest :) \nBut the most concern I have is why would you not give the characters in TV their signature uniforms? It was like the base of silo - colours of the uniforms. Now they look like they just pop of from Matrix Zion. Was it intentional? Not to give uniforms? \nP.S. And this unfortunate tree will be hunting me till the rest of my days :D\nP.

I've been an active player since 2001 and whenever people would ask me what I wanted to be when I was older, I'd say a writer or a member of TNT.\n\nI stared working full-time in publishing in 2014. I've always worked in licensing, meaning I've edited and written books like the *Kung Fu Panda 3* movie, *Voltron: Legendary Defender,* LEGO, Harry Potter, Peppa Pig, Peanuts, etc.  \n\nIn about 2017-2018, I was working at a different publisher and a different cookbook entirely. The idea of an official Neopets cookbook came about. My coworkers and I contacted the agent who we'd worked with on other properties. It didn't go through (that publisher was a very specific kids' publisher and thought Neopets has too much of an adult fanbase, which, fair). But I held onto hopeeeee....\n\nIn 2021, I joined Andrews McMeel. Actually, I talked about wanting to publish a Neopets cookbook in my interview. My Publisher was really excited about the idea, so we resumed conversations with the agent. Then I put together a proposal, compiled an offer, and we got a licensing deal with Neopets for the cookbook that they approved :D\n\nTNT has been incredibly supportive throughout the entire process. They'd also wanted a cookbook, so it was a match made in Faerieland. \n\n\\~Erinn",

First of all, is that your podcast, because if so, Strawberries and Ranch sounds ... terrifying and intriguing and now I might have to listen to all of this?\n\nMost of the recipes in the cookbook taste good. THAT BEING SAID, there's definitely Gross Food from Neopia. It wouldn't be Neopian otherwise. There's Iced Fish Cake, which you could theoretically put two big fish heads on . . . ORRRRR you could use fondant. I will let you decide there :D\n\nThere's also jokes throughout, like washing your ingredients before cooking. You don't want a Rotten Negg and Onion Quesadilla on your hands!\n\n\\~Erinn",

We originally said 40 recipes, but somewhere down the line it teetered just over (obviously, the joke recipes and 2/3 Omelette vs. 1/3 Omelette don't count). We knew we had to have a section on Omelettes, Cup of Borovan, and some Jellies. We also tried to pick dishes that varied in complexity (Meaty Asparagus, for example, isn't that difficult, whereas the Ghostmallow Smore is a little more involved).\n\nThe Neopets Team and I met before production began, and we just went over some recipes we think would be fun. Then I met with the recipe writer, the fantastic Rebecca Woods, who weighed in on what she thought would make most sense. \n\nI also kept a spreadsheet of all the Neopets featured, to make sure every species was prominently displayed at least once (Poogles, for example, are the star of Poogle Sushi, but Kaus, which do not have their own food in the cookbook, are on the Checkerboard Pizza page. It's a Checkered Kau and it's their favourite food - d'oh!). \n\nBut honestly, there's a lot more I would've loved to do too. If we get greenlit for a sequel, I'd like to lean more into the Gross Foods. \\~ Erinn",

Your cookbook sounds like a treat!\n\nI've always wondered if cookbook authors ever concoct recipes that include ingredients that they themselves don't like, and, if so, if they have to rely on the opinion of their taste testers more for those dishes. Is that something you and/or Rebecca had to deal with while you were designing the cookbook?\n\nAlso, if I may make a suggestion, if you get to do a second Neopets cookbook would you consider having a few recipes for our real life pets? I can think of quite a few Neopian dishes dogs and cats would like, and even some for ~~cy~~bunnies and other popular pets. Just a thought!\n\nOh, and because I don't see this elsewhere (although I may have missed it), could we pretty please with Nerkmids on top see a photo from the book? (A photo of Peophin-sized Pteri would also satisfy.)\n\nLooking forward to trying out the cookbook!",

To be totally honest, we have to see how the first cookbook does before working on a second one. \n\nSpooky Jelly Brains - Hmm, I think you could definitely modify the ingredients for the 1/2 Rainbow Jelly in this current cookbook to the recipe here. Just use blue, of course. The blue in the Jelly Brains is a bit translucent; you might be able to get the same look by using a brain mold and going over the lines/shadows with a gentle hand and an icing pen and reducing the blue food coloring in the Rainbow Jelly by 50%.\n\nBrains a la Tree . . . I'm getting a pumpkin pasta vibe. Maybe make the dough into a nest, cook in a slotted spoon so it stays together best as possible, smother in drippy cheese and trees.\n\nObviously haven't tested either of those recipes out so they may not work.

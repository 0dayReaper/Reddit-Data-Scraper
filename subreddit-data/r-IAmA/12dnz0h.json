    "postText": "I\u2019m Dr. Judy L. Postmus, PhD, ACSW, Dean of the University of Maryland School of Social Work. My research has focused on the physical, sexual, and economic victimization of women. I\u2019m particularly interested in financial empowerment and financial literacy of women who are victims of domestic and economic abuse. I was the founder and director (2007-2018) of the Rutgers University Center on Violence Against Women and Children, which works to eliminate physical, sexual, and other forms of violence against women and children \u2014 and the power imbalances that permit them \u2014 through multidisciplinary research, education, and community engagement.\n\nI\u2019m here to talk about what is economic abuse, sometimes called financial abuse, outlining the signs and symptoms of economic abuse, identifying how it shows up in relationships, presenting how social workers can screen for economic abuse, and encouraging social workers and other human services employees to help and empower victims. In this lens, financial abuse isn\u2019t a matter of someone simply stealing money from a loved one. It\u2019s manipulating someone through coercive control of their finances or their ability to earn money.\n\nI\u2019m happy to answer questions on any of these topics:\n\n\u2022\tWhat do you do if a loved one experiences financial abuse?\n\n\u2022\tHow does financial abuse connect to other forms of abuse?\n\n\u2022\tWhat can the banking industry do to help survivors?\n\n\u2022\tIs financial abuse against the law? Can someone be arrested for financial abuse?\n\n\u2022\tWhat is financial empowerment and how can it help survivors?\n\n\u2022\tFor someone who experiences economic abuse, what can you do to strengthen your own empowerment around finances?\n\nI previously held academic positions at the Rutgers University, University of Kansas, and the University at Albany. I\u2019ve also served as a planner in the Florida Department of Children and Families; executive director of Domestic Abuse Shelter in Marathon, Fla., and an associate director at Miami Bridge Inc.\n\n[Proof](https://twitter.com/Jlpostmus/status/1638956096965734400?s=20)\n\n\\*\\*\\*EDIT\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for participating in this AMA. I have to run. I enjoyed all of your questions on this important topic. Feel free to follow me on Twitter [JLPostmus](https://twitter.com/Jlpostmus). Have a great weekend!",

In my research with survivors, many could talk about the more recognizable abuse experiences and were surprised that financial abuse was yet another way they were being abused and controlled. Reach out to your local domestic violence organization to help guide you and your friend to learn more. Good luck.",

I was never paid and it was completely abusive, along with other messed up stuff at home of course. Eventually I escaped him, almost 30 years old, and he then took almost all my disability funds until I eventually broke free of his manipulation and brain washing and have my own finances and safety away from him.\n\nThere were so, so many failures in the system, both school and extended family, that allowed this to happen to me. \n\nI guess my question to you is, was there even a way for me to be saved? I often blame myself for not escaping sooner, I admit. What can be done to help prevent what happened to me happening to other kids, when we're invisible as soon as we're out of school?",

Being subjected to manipulation at a grand scale (essentially any and all forms of abuse but physical), it maliciously corrupts your decision-making and reasoning, it is a voice of ruin. We all know this, yet in hindsight we tend to forget; once freed from the chains of subjugation we look back and have thoughts like \"*shouldn't have... should have... if... had I instead*\", but the reality is that you should have been who you are and you should have done what you do, which is what you did and it is also what you would have done had there not been an *abuser*. \n\nYou did the only thing you could have done and what happened is the only thing that ever could have happened, just the same as everything else in life. We always do what we do and what happens is what happens, and it's fine. When we look back we cannot assign blame or anything to ourselves for had there simply not been an abuser then, it would have been fine.\n\nIt is like if a brick falls from the sky and hits you in the head, maybe you shouldn't have been standing there but really maybe someone shouldn't have dropped a brick from the sky.\n\nSo, when we look back at things, instead, be at peace.\n\n---\nI'm sorry that I have no answer to your actual question though",

We know that financial abuse is part of a pattern of power and control where other types of abuse (ie. physical, sexual, emotional) are used to trap victims in relationships. We know that batterer intervention programs have mixed results as to whether an abuser can change or not. Unfortunately, we don't have evidence about programs directed to abusers who use economic abuse. More work is needed to develop stronger interventions that help abusers and to test whether those interventions work. \n\nBut for now, the hard decision about leaving a relationship is one that the person has to make in light of so many other factors that influence that decision to leave. One proven intervention for survivors is to create a safety plan - including a financial safety plan - that will guide them to know when is the best time to leave and how to do so in a safe manner. \n\nI recently published a book - Building Financial Empowerment for Survivors of Domestic Violence: A Path to Hope and Freedom - which provides greater information for someone struggling with the decision to leave a relationship where there is financial abuse. Included in the book are ideas of how to create a financial safety plan like checking credit scores, opening up private bank accounts, ensuring that paychecks are going into those accounts, and finding supportive individuals to help you manage your money.",

Our finances were 100% joint except for retirement accounts.  She wrote the checks for our bills every month and also had banking access to a business that I started.  I was kept in the dark about all of our finances because I blindly trusted her.\n\nTowards the end of the marriage, the other abuses escalated in order to keep me from realizing that he had been taking money from our shared account (and probably the business prior to that). She shredded the previous 3 years of our bank statements to hide it.  \n\nHer plan to escalate the abuse worked well. She even laughed about how \"I would have signed anything just be over this\".  She still owes me over $100K from her retirement (in the state I was in, all retirement savings during the marriage are added together and split 50/50).  At this point, no, I really don't care.  I feel lucky to have survived the whole ordeal.\n\nSo, in any serious relationship, both partners need to be involved in the money part.

We got together when I was young and she was a bit older than me and I stupidly thought that meant she knew better than me on a lot of things. I'm still dealing with the fallout physically, financially, and psychologically. I was just served today with my ex's third baseless lawsuit trying to prevent me from selling the house I own and pay a mortgage on but don't live in that she has refused to vacate. (I really, really, really wish I were making that up for karma but I'm not.) She burned my savings, destroyed my credit, and left me with a pile of debt I'm finally close to paying off. In her case it was Borderline Personality Disorder. (Although I don't want to contribute to the negative stereotypes around BPD - it's a difficult, complicated condition that both good and bad people suffer from.) I'm not sure how I would've gotten out without the help and support of my amazing parents.\n\nDon't be afraid to protect yourself. Don't be afraid to ask \"Is this relationship beneficial for both of us?\" Don't be afraid to leave if the answer is no.",

They can call employers and get the person fired, they can open up businesses in their name without the woman knowing about it, they can hide assets, and they can destroy her property. The question is would these experiences happen to men? Unfortunately we don't have answers yet. And we don't know if those experiences are the same if the abuser is female or male. More research is needed; I hope someone out there will take this on to find these answers.",

The same needs to happen at the state level where they should look at their existing domestic violence laws and include economic abuse (along with the signs) as against the law. They also need to invest in interventions - like financial education programs or asset-building programs - to support survivors of economic abuse.",

Mostly, these protocols should support the person's own plans on ways to be safe - physically, mentally, and financially. \n\nIf someone has a partner that is trying to sabotage their employment standing (e.g., making them late for work, showing up unannounced and being disruptive), the person should have the support of the institution to put into place protocols that keep this person safe from being fired. Perhaps the protocol would include not allowing the partner to enter the building? Perhaps it's helping them with direct deposits to safe accounts? Perhaps it's just being sensitive and knowledgeable about financial abuse and the tactics used to sabotage employment so that we believe and support the employee who is experiencing such abuse.\n\nMost importantly, the institution has to have policies that encourage and keep the survivor safe when they reach out for help from HR or their supervisor or someone in authority.\n\nInstitutions can also provide financial education services through workshops or trainings that focus on \"typical\" financial management content (ie., budgeting, saving money, retirement) but also adds a layer of content on economic abuse and the signs. The Allstate Foundation has a great curriculum that does just that and it's available online for free at [https://allstate-foundation.everfi-next.net/welcome/financialeducation](https://allstate-foundation.everfi-next.net/welcome/financialeducation)",

Keep in mind that the focus is on someone trying to maintain power and control over someone else - in this case, using money. \n\nThe best way to protect oneself from a partner who has a problem with gambling is to check credit scores on a regular basis to catch when credit accounts have been opened - in this case, to finance gambling. And, of course, to work with a financial advisor (can get support from your bank) on how to protect your accounts from your partner. This might include opening up your own account and ensuring he doesn't have access. \n\nFinally, I would recommend that you help him get support for his gambling addiction.\n\nTo answer your second question, it is a really great question and one that we don't have research on. Economic abuse is a relatively new area of abuse that is being studied by researchers even though the tactic and use by abusers has been around a long time. We  still need to learn the prevalence and type of economic abuse of men and how that is the same or different than that of women.",

Some laws exist for financial exploitation of the elderly but even those cases are difficult to investigate and prosecute. And those cases often focus on either an adult child exploiting a parent or a caregiver exploiting an elderly person; they don't focus on intimate partners who are married and seen as \"one\" in the eyes of the law related to finances.\n\nThere are a few states (shout out to Maine and Pennsylvania) who are looking to change some of their laws. But we need to do more. Other countries, like the UK, have made progress to expanding the legal definition of domestic violence to include \"coercive control\" which takes in all types of abusive tactics. But here, if your married partner opens up a business in your name and goes bankrupt, he destroys your credit and you are responsible for the debt.",

    "postText": "You might remember my 2016 AMA about my three teenaged friends who were kidnapped from their hometown in Vietnam and trafficked into China. They were \"lucky\" to be sold as brides, not brothel workers.\n\nOne ran away and was brought home safely; the other two just disappeared. Nobody knew where they were, what had happened to them, or even if they were still alive.\n\nI gave up everything and risked my life to find the girls in China. To everyone's surprise (including my own!), I did actually find them - but that was just the beginning.\n\nBoth of my friends had given birth in China. Still just teenagers, they faced a heartbreaking dilemma: each girl had to choose between her daughter and her own freedom.\n\nFor six years I've been a full-time volunteer with 'The Human, Earth Project', to help fight the global human trafficking crisis. Of its 40 million victims, most are women sold for sex, and many are only girls.\n\nWe recently released an award-winning documentary to tell my friends' stories, and are now fundraising to continue our anti-trafficking work. You can now check out the film for $1 and help support our work at [http://www.sistersforsale.com](http://www.sistersforsale.com)\n\nWe want to tour the documentary around North America and help rescue kidnapped girls.\n\nPROOF: You can find proof (and more information) on the front page of our website at: [http://www.humanearth.net](http://www.humanearth.net)\n\nI'll be here from 7am EST, for at least three hours. I might stay longer, depending on how many questions there are :)\n\nFire away!\n\n\\--- EDIT ---\n\nQuestions are already pouring in way, way faster than I can answer them. I'll try to get to them all - thanks for you patience!! :)\n\nBIG LOVE to everyone who has contributed to help support our work. We really need funding to keep this organisation alive. Your support makes a huge difference, and really means a lot to us - THANK YOU!!\n\n(Also - we have only one volunteer here responding to contributions. Please be patient with her - she's doing her best, and will send you the goodies as soon as she can!) :)\n\n\\--- EDIT #2 ---\n\nWow the response here has just been overwhelming! I've been answering questions for six hours and it's definitely time for me to take a break. There are still a ton of questions down the bottom I didn't have a chance to get to, but most of them seem to be repeats of questions I've already answered higher up.\n\nTHANK YOU so much for all your interest and support!!!",

I imagine they process (buyer side) is of the mail order bride variety.  You pay someone to \"connect\" you with a woman.  They probably say \"these women are willing to come over and marry you to not be poor, you just have to pay us our fee\". They aren't going to come out and say, \"we have this woman we kidnapped and we have this woman we kidnapped\" when offering the women.  That would make no sense.  \n\nThis isn't to say there aren't men out there that are aware and don't care, but just how I imagine the process goes.",

Unfortunately it's Hmong people doing most of the trafficking.\n\nThe Vietnamese Hmong will sell the girls to Chinese Hmong (who still speak their language, if not the same dialect), who will then sell the girls onto other Chinese people (with whom they can't speak at all)\n\nIgnorance certainly plays a part, and I believe much of it is wilful /u/Aliktren",

In our normal life, people live in the US for example, it is much cheaper to meet someone and get Marry. \nHowever in China is different. If you are a man, you need to pay the woman\u2019s family, a lot of money usually.  After the woman\u2019s family is happy about the amount, then they will agree the marriage.  At the end of the day, most parents want their daughter have a better life and have financial stability for the rest of her life. So it is extremely hard for man who doesn\u2019t have a good paying job or come from rich parents find a wife. For a man like that, he is very likely to look for a wife from a worst off part of the country for a wife. \nNow imagine you are a man at the worst part of the country and the only income source is from farming,  it is very likely no one would want to marry you. For these man, the only option for them is find a wife from poor country. \nYou may say if you cannot afford a somewhat comfortable life yourself, why would you marry? Well, in China carry on your family name is very important and is the man\u2019s job. So these man will get marry and will have as many kids as they can until have a boy.\n\nEdit: To clarify, there are people get marry without considering money or follow this \u201ctradition\u201d in the timeline of history. This is a generalization of what my understanding of the culture. Living in a fast changing time, and moving away to look back into, I think this still held true for many people because of the lack of education, opportunities,  harsh living environment, and children are they only secure retirement. It is very sad in many ways and for many people. \nI agree things like this shouldn\u2019t happen anymore. Maybe the only thing can change this is the Chinese government adopts some kind of social program to level the playground for everyone, and ensure everyone has a secure retirement. \nI truly hope there are some improvements.",

I live in an area with a relatively high population of Hmong and a couple of my friends were kidnapped into marriage, both while still in high school. One left her \u201chusband\u201d and tried to return to her parent\u2019s house, only to be faced with huge pressure to go back to him. She chose homelessness, but is now college educated, married to a man of her choice, with four kids. The other stayed with her husband. She did finish high school, but she never went to college. She also has four kids. She and her husband seem to barely tolerate each other.\n\nThese weren\u2019t reported to the police, either. The consensus among the community is that this is a social, internal problem and not one to involve the authorities. Which is awful; several years ago, there was a woman murdered along with her three children by her husband while she was trying to leave him. Rumor had it that she was also a kidnapped bride.",

Getting married at a fairly young age just seems to be very ingrained in the culture.",

Which makes life even more challenging for the girls who do genuinely want to return. \n\nPartly also - as /u/Ccracked guessed - her family actually respected the fact that she'd been sold to her \"husband\", although they were not involved and did not receive any money. \n\nAnd part of it was the girl's own fault - she didn't want her family to worry about her, so (at the same time she was telling me the truth about her situation, and how desperate she was to come home) she told her family she was fine, that her \"husband\" was a nice guy with a big house and lots of money. They were poor farmers who couldn't give her a better life at home in Vietnam, so they told her to stay there",

I am just assuming though, these kind of things happen a lot in my native country Nepal, where girls are sold in India as prostitutes, housemaids or brides. Their family doesn't accept them back because of the stigma, they want to accept their daughter back but they cannot because if they do the whole society will backfire and in some cases even kick them out of the community. It's really heartbreaking to see girls who escaped prostitution have to go back to it again because they have no other way to feed themselves",

Following the crackpot farming theories of Lysenko was a big factor.\n\n*Farmers were ordered to \u2018close-plant\u2019 (sowing millions of seeds of different species together in a small area) and \u2018deep-plough\u2019 (digging the ground much deeper to encourage deep root growth). Both these experiments failed and entire plantings yielded next to nothing. Farmers were forbidden to use chemical fertilisers and large amounts of land were left fallow, with poor results.\u00a0*\n\nBy that point, Lysenko had already tried his theories in the USSR and failed (causing their famines), making it even more tragic. But that's what you get when you ignore agricultural science for a man who has \"better\" ideas.\n\nhttps://alphahistory.com/chineserevolution/great-chinese-famine/",

She was brilliant and was married to another college student. He beat her, locked her in the family house unless they went to class, expected her to do his homework and take care of the house. They had a son quickly. \n\nThe Chinese government had them to apply schools in the USA and China for doctoral work. He got in locally in China but she got in everywhere. She contacted the school in the US about extra scholarships/loans for herself and made the decision to leave her husband with help from  Chinese community in the college town (the school connected her with them). She said she knew he would never let her live down being accepted to schools over him, she was legit afraid he would kill her.\n\nShe made the choice to run away in the night, hide for a few weeks and then came to the US, leaving her son. She said she was able to leave because he was boy and she knew his life would be fine - a daughter might have caused her to rethink the plan.\n\nShe said her sister brings the boy gifts at school, first anonymously but then later telling him it was from his mother in the US. She did really well in the US last time I talked to her, she got her doctorate and was fielding job offers here, met a nice grad student and was seriously dating him. \n\nShe said she was not going back anytime soon, she just hoped her son would find her eventually or at least keep up with her family.\n\nHeartbreaking story for me to hear.

I was wondering around Beijing once by myself, as a 12 year old who wanted some McDonald's. It was right next to the karaoke bar my dad owned. As soon as I sat down, a 20s or 30s male stared at me the entire time. When I went to leave, he followed me, even as I went down the nearby staircase. He followed me to the stairs too and was calling for me to wait, that he just wanted to ask me some questions. Even as a young girl I knew there was something weird about this, so I didn't talk to him and just ran into the Karaoke bar. He went in behind me, and when the staff stopped him (they all knew me so I could just run into the establishment) he tried to tell them that I was his daughter who was misbehaving and asked for me back. Obviously the staff knew this was a lie and they handled it. \n\nBut many, many other times I have wandered around Asia by myself, later as a grown woman, and never felt much danger at all. I know my story is only anecdotal. But rationally speaking, it makes more sense to capture children who are not old enough to fight back and are still young enough to be brainwashed, than to go after an adult.",

The ethnic minority groups are often exploited by the majority Kinh people. If you're visiting one of the communities, it's far better to book with a representative of that community - otherwise you might well be taking advantage of those communities. \n\nIn Sapa, for example, I would highly recommend trekking with an organisation like [hmong-family.com](https://hmong-family.com) \\- which is a fantastic little company owned and operated by local Hmong people",

You are a young girl with little knowledge of the world outside your tiny village and you are now kidnapped and don't know what's going to happen to you.  You don't know if you're going to live or die.\n2. The kidnapper tells you that you need to follow his directions exactly.  If you run away, he will find you and kill you.  \n3. You are handed to a man (a. you don't speak his language. b. you didn't know you were sold) and you are told to do what this man says or the man will tell your kidnapper about your disobedient and he will come back and punish you.  Plus, let's take it a step further, he will go back to your village and kill your entire family.  \n4. You care about your little sisters and little brothers, you care about your parents.  Do you dare defy this man's words?  How do you know you can trust the man you've been given to?  Who can you tell? Who's on your side, who are the spies that are working for your kidnappers.  You are among strangers, how do you know you can trust anyone?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs your best choice to stay quiet and try to survive, or take a risk and possibly get severely punished?",

Many of them don't know the language, so they feel like they would literally be powerless trying to get back home in a country they don't know, where they have no clue what direction their home even is from there, with no ability to talk to locals, and no knowledge of who they can trust. Under those conditions, they fear that there is a very real possibility that if they try to run away they might end up dead not even because of the traffickers, but just getting lost and having no way to know what to do. For all they know if they run into the forest there's no other places to go in that direction for hundreds of miles.\n\nThere's also the fact that by the time they learn the language they will almost certainly already have a kid. So what now running away is the added danger of the fact that it would be even harder to with the kid, and they would feel guilty about running away without them.\n\nA third issue is the fact that based on their situation, they might suspect that even if they escaped they couldn't go back to their original life. They would forever irrevocably be seen as different even in their own community, and there is a good chance that there would be a lot of victim-blaming. And since they aren't virgins they would be seen differently too. And even if it wasn't super likely they would be caught again, they would be living in fear that they could be. So it can be super demoralizing to be concerned that it would not only be difficult to try to escape, but that if you succeeded you have to be concerned that the rewards wouldn't be very large. Especially if you originally lived in a poor area that wasn't that great in the first place.",

It's a very complex and nuanced issue, not nearly as cut and dried as it seems on the surface.\n\nOne thing that seems to hold true almost universally though is that the vast majority of the people in the trade are unscrupulous predators.... But even that's not always the case. There have been  cases of girls \"making it\"  and going back to get their siblings married out of poverty. So it's all kinds of fucked up and no universal truths to be had.\n\nThe real problem here is poverty. Millions (billions?) of people in the world are poor in a way that very few people in developed nations can comprehend, and what seems like a nightmare scenario to some is a ray of hope to others.\n\n It's suuuper fucked up.\n\nIf you want to end trafficking, end poverty.",

    "postText": "I am a lawyer, activist, and professional troublemaker that photobombed former Equifax CEO Richard Smith in his Senate Banking hearing (https://twitter.com/wamandajd). I \"cause-played\" as the Monopoly Man to call attention to S.J. Res. 47, Senate Republicans' get-out-of-jail-free card for companies like Equifax and Wells Fargo - and to brighten your day by trolling millionaire CEOs on live TV. Ask me anything!\n\nProof:\n\n - https://i.redd.it/6cmuac6dv1qz.jpg\n - https://i.redd.it/kji1krugv1qz.jpg\n\nTo help defeat S.J. Res. 47, sign our petition at www.noripoffclause.com and call your Senators (tool &amp; script here: http://p2a.co/m2ePGlS)!\n\nETA: Thank you for the great questions, everyone! After a full four hours, I have to tap out. But feel free to follow me on Twitter at @wamandajd if you'd like to remain involved and join a growing movement of creative activism.",

Being \u201cso far detached\u201d from _common Americans\u2019_ reality is not a justification. \n\nPaul (hackers) decides to steal my stuff while I\u2019m not home. It\u2019s a simple task because my house wasn\u2019t Being watched like it should have been - shit, one of the Windows were wide open. Matt, the security guard in charge of securing my property (Equifax), knows I\u2019ve been robbed and he fucked up.  So Matt shoots me a text that says \u201cPaul stole a bunch of stuff from houses in your neighborhood and you may have been a victim.\u201d Followed by a second text that says \u201cMaybe not though; heads you were robbed, tails you weren\u2019t.\u201d Well that\u2019s fucking weird so I text Matt back saying \u201cwas I robbed or not, and if I was then how could you let this happen?  You\u2019re paid to prevent this!\u201d Matt knows he needs to make this right so he says \u201cI know man, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m going to put this brand new lock on the front door, and install HD cams with night vision all around your property. I know it\u2019s going to be rocky for a little while since you have to go buy new things, but once you have them they will be secure!\u201d So I say \u201cfine,\u201d lesson learned - forgive and forget. He didn\u2019t really say \u201cfor free\u201d in his text, but seemed to be imply that it was an apology, a token of good faith. So he installs the locks and cameras and has me sign a little receipt that says he installed them and showed me how they work. 30 days later, I get my first invoice for the 72 monthly payments of $29.99 for the equipment - which doesn\u2019t include the extra hours he\u2019s billing me now to watch the video streams from the cameras. I discover by looking at the line items on the invoice that these cameras and locks are made by a company called Matt\u2019s Security Hardware, Inc. - a company Matt started two weeks before I was robbed. I text Matt, pissed, telling him he will get this invoice paid over my dead body and I\u2019ll see him in court. He texts back, but it\u2019s just a picture of my signature under a clause of the work receipt saying if I have a fucking problem I agree to go talk to Matt\u2019s older brother about it and not take him to court. Whatever Matt\u2019s brother says is enforceable to the same extent as a judge. \n\n*Matt didn\u2019t steal my stuff, but he\u2019s still robbing me.*\n\n After all of this, I\u2019m left wondering if Matt didn\u2019t pay Paul to target my property - or maybe he left that window open and hoped for the best. \n\nI used this example because it shows that when the situation is flipped, and the \u201cservant\u201d or \u201cemployee\u201d steals from the \u201clord\u201d or \u201cemployer\u201d most Americans\u2019 brain doesn\u2019t try to tone down the rage by saying Matt wasn\u2019t living in my reality. \n\nThey (equifax and any number of companies with ethics like theirs) have a lot, they want more, and they won\u2019t stop until they have it all. Out of touch with common, \u201ceveryday\u201d reality? Then let\u2019s remind them: theft is illegal. People who break the laws have to pay consequences. In any other situation, \u201cbeing out of touch with reality\u201d as an excuse to a crime would imply enough of a personality disorder to get someone locked up in an institution for the criminally insane.

I give you a bunch of money and you do what I want? I mean, hell- you already sold us out to Comcast [or similar shitcorp/ lobbyist group] for $X, which seems pretty cheap. So why can't a constituent like me get it in on this, too?\" \n\nEdit: People are mentioning how the mail is handled in D.C. So here's an alternative  suggestion- monopoly money, smugglers' edition. Find different, non-USPS ways to get it into their offices. Hidden in magazines, In a UPS box along with official looking documents, disguised as reams of printer paper, in the pockets of their dry cleaning,  etc. so that every time they and their staffers turn around, \"Surprise!! You're corrupt!\"",

With this example, we'd remove the monopoly money and throw it out and pass the letter to legislative staff for response.  If it came from a constituent, even if it was a form letter provided to them by an association, they would get a response.  A form letter response but a response nonetheless.  No correspondence like this would go to the member.  If we got several hundred of the same thing we would pull one to show the member so they know the kind of thing people are saying.  I believe we had a very standard mail room operation that is replicated throughout the Congress in various forms based on the size of the constituency.",

A few clauses have opt-out provisions, where you can write to the company (usually within 30 days) to waive the clauses, but that is rare.\n\nHonestly, the most effective way to protect your right to sue big companies when they break the law is to push for federal protections like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's arbitration rule. That is why I am fighting S.J. Res. 47, the effort to repeal it.",

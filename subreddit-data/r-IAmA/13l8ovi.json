You might know me as Auntie Ruby in Ms. Marvel, Symmetra in Overwatch, Rampart in Apex Legends, Fy'ra Rai on Critical Role, and - most recently - as Lady Amangeaux Epice\u00e9 du Peche on Dropout.tv's Dimension 20: The Ravening War (click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4xTd-NjEj4) for the trailer, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiBe4WJaLo0) for the first full episode on Youtube)\n\nIt's been an honor to be part of so many brilliant creative endeavors, and I can't wait to do more! (you'll also see me soon on Critical Role's investigative horror series, [Candela Obscura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvlAgbSUiWw))\n\nI'm here to answer your questions - about Dimension 20: The Ravening War, my work on Critical Role, and anything else you'd like to talk about. Ask me anything! @sweeetanj on the socials! (remember: that's 3 \"e\"s). And if you want to know more about my life than I can fit in this AMA, you might wanna check out my book - [I Am Fun Size, and So Are YOU!](https://www.amazon.com/Am-Fun-Size-Are-YOU-ebook/dp/B0B8TPBZPY)\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/zknh1lhyjf0b1.jpg\n\n**Edit 3:05pm Pacific:** It's been so lovely talking to you all, but I've gotta run! Let's do this again sometime!",

I think what makes a character most interesting to me is the conflict between what they think they are good at and who they think they are versus what actually happens and what flaws they have.

You're going to LOVE DesiQuest :)\n\nSome of my favorite themes are: \n-people whose experience with pain or loss in the past has driven them toward a bigger cause\n-people who have had to adapt to a difficult or unfamiliar world and how they have found their place and power within it. (e.g. in Undeadwood, given the world of that particular game, my character had to find a way to be powerful and valuable that was unique to her own set of skills.)\n-internal conflict between who someone is and who they want to be. \n\nGenerally anything that gives me some kind of obstacle to work with, internal or external, past or present, is really fun. And definitely giving them a little weakness that might pop up in between moments of strength and courage. \n\nAnd I love finding their voice! A specific voice just for them.",

I honestly don't have a regular system for it - sometimes it's a visual, sometimes it's an internal struggle I want to explore, sometimes it's a physical build I want to play. For Lady A, I figured one of my favorite foods in the world is spicy mango, so that was the inspiration - and then trying to decide what that would mean when manifested in a personality and look. My DesiQuest character on the other hand came directly from the desire to have a particular animal by my side in that campaign. And also my desire to play an Indian character that wasn't an auntie (which tends to be what I have played a lot in the past). I will say I seem to tend to go for mechanics later than personality or physicality because I feel like that part comes out of who they are. For example, knowing Lady A had grown up a noble and then lived at court as the queen for so long was what made me choose a lot of the things she was good at or not so good at. She's might not be physically super tough, but after all those years of navigating the noble life and court, her passive perception is through the roof.",

I think one of the coolest things to explore is when an extremely capable character fails or a character who is a novice succeeds wildly - that unusual moment of someone being surprised by themselves is really fun to play.",

(I'll admit that's been my favorite entrance I've gotten to have so far...what a great experience Aabria laid out for us all) I think the most important thing, just like acting, is committing to the story and supporting your fellow players in telling theirs, and being willing for that to mean that, no matter what you as the player may have wanted for the character, you need to commit fully to who that character is and how to tell the story the dice choose for you. I think one of the coolest things to explore is when an extremely capable character fails or a character who is a novice succeeds wildly - that unusual moment of someone being surprised by themselves is really fun to play.\n\nThank you so much!",

The playing part is very similar - committing to the truth of the story, the characters, and the dice and what those rolls mean - while honoring the fact that life is full of comedy in dramatic times and drama in lighter times. You can go pretty darn quickly from hysterical laughter to heartfelt tears playing with both of them because everyone commits so much to all of it. And both of them are ridiculously fun and wildly satisfying to play with as a performer and a person",

As for DesiQuest, I CAN tell you that Jasmine created an extraordinary world for that show, and I loved doin it so much I cried when we finished (also from the emotional release of the events of the last episode, so THAT'S a sneak peek right there!)",

I'm not very fancy - if there are fancy things in my bathroom its usually because I got a free sample of something...lI've been sticking with what works for me for years. But sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen for sure. Done that ever since I was a kid, no matter how dark my skin was. There's a great OTC one by Neutrogena that I can't remember the name of but it's super sheer and slides on great under makeup, I use that a lot, and it's like SPF 70.

For some reason right now I\u2019m imagining playing at a table with Dame Helen Mirren, Sir Ian McKellen, and Sir Patrick Stewart. Because I know ALL of them would be cracking each other up one second and breaking our hearts the next. (But also. I just wanna be at a table with them period because they are incredible). And we\u2019ve already achieved one of my TTRPG dreams of having a table of all South Asian players and DM when we filmed DesiQuest, so that one is checked off the list.",

Is it just that being queen kept her from having quite as many adventures and xp as the others, or is there a \"because of spoilery reasons\" kind of answer?\n\nThank you so much for being such a light on screen. It is SO fun to watch you (you and Aabria and you and Brennan specifically I could watch for Ever). I hope you're having a great night!",

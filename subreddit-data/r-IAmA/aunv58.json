    "postText": "I\u2019m excited to be back for my seventh AMA. I\u2019ve learned a lot from the Reddit community over the past year (check out this fascinating [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/adxzo7/what_areas_of_robotics_research_are_you_most/) on robotics research), and I can\u2019t wait to answer your questions.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what I\u2019ve been up to (besides waiting in line for hamburgers), I recently [wrote](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Year-in-Review-2018?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGRE) about what I learned at work last year.\n\nMelinda and I also just [published](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_10_AL2019_BG-RE_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGRE) our 11th Annual Letter. We wrote about nine things that have surprised us and inspired us to take action.\n\nOne of those surprises, for example, is that Africa is the youngest continent. Here is an [infographic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infographics/comments/aulqu1/africa_is_the_youngest_continent/) I made to explain what I mean.\n\n**Proof:** [https://](https://old.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant_wait_to_kick_off_my_seventh_ama/)[reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant\\_wait\\_to\\_kick\\_off\\_my\\_seventh\\_ama/](https://old.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auo4qn/cant_wait_to_kick_off_my_seventh_ama/)\n\n**Edit:** I have to sign-off soon, but I\u2019d love to answer a few more questions about energy innovation and climate change. If you post your questions [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/thisisbillgates/comments/auosel/ask_me_about_energy_innovation_and_climate_change/), I\u2019ll answer as many as I can later on.\n\n**Edit:** Although I would love to stay forever, I have to get going. Thank you, Reddit, for another great AMA:  [https://imgur.com/a/kXmRubr](https://imgur.com/a/kXmRubr)",

This is the 100th anniversary of the Spanish flu and if it came back the amount of travel would make it spread faster than it did last time.\n\nOnce you get past those threats then the biggest question is global cooperation to avoid climate change and reduce the risk of war. It is disconcerting to see a rise of countries turning inwards and not investing in alliances which have helped us avoid big wars since World War 2.\n\nClimate change is a real test of how we can work together globally since [it is a complex problem](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2019-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_11_AL2019_BG-RE_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGRE#ALChapter3) where major changes need to be done well in advance of the big harms.",

Your willingness to help those who have less than you is something that I truly admire and aspire to.\n\nMy question is how do I feel like I'm doing enough? With all the pain and suffering that I see everyday, it's hard to feel like I am actually making a difference in the grand scheme of things. How do you deal with feeling like it's a never ending struggle to actually make a difference and help people?\n\nEdit: I've noticed a lot of people giving gold and silver in this ama. Please consider donating the money instead to worthy causes. I'm sure Mr Gates would appreciate that a lot more. Thank you. And a big thank you to everyone for their kind words, I really do appreciate it.",

You need to focus on how much you can improve things and feel good about that. We need more people to visit Africa to see the progress but also to see how much needs to be done. Nothing is as good as meeting people who have to live with malaria or HIV or see their children die.\n\nPeople like yourself who work on the front lines deserve immense credit. Over time the deaths and suffering will go down but I am sure some days that is hard to see.",

                    "comment": "Yes but I am worried that people think it is easy to do -\" just buy renewables and drive electric cars in rich countries.\". These are good things but they won't stop the temperature from continuing to rise.\n\nUnfortunately [the sources of emissions are very broad](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/My-plan-for-fighting-climate-change?WT.mc_id=02_25_2019_13_AL2019_BG-RE_&amp;WT.tsrc=BGRE) and even in the case of electricity you have to cover the times when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine and electrcitiy storage (batteries) are not likely to be cheap enough to cover this. My friend Vaclav Smil gives the example of Tokyo's electricity needs when the renewable sources are not available for a number of days.\n\nIt is surprising there hasn't been more discussion about the innovations required across all the sources including agriculture and industrial materials like steel and cement.\n\nA good question to ask an expert is - what year is it likely that the temperature rise will stop?\n\nI am working on getting good explanatory material out so the discussion can be more grounded in how complex it is and avoid over simplistic solutions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

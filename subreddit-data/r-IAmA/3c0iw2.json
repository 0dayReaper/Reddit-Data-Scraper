Gonna leave the og comment below\n\n/r/justsaynope\n/r/blackout2015\n\nJuly 10 has been suggested as a no reddit day. Don't post, comment, or even load the site. Go through the weekend if you can.\n\nEdit: If every person that thought \"this will never happen\" actually went along with it, it would happen. There seems to be a lot of people upset and few willing to even find something to do other than reddit for a few days. \n\nI'm open to other ideas, but this is the only hope normal users have to make any kind of meaningful impact here. \n\nEDIT2: spread the message guys, copy this comment on big subreddits, comment on high karma posts, make posts with this message. We need people to see this in order to work and to hit where it hurts!\n\nEDIT3: Thanks for all the support guys, hopefully with this we can show that we, the users, have a say on how Reddit is managed",

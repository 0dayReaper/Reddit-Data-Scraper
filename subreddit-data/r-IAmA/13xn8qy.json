    "postText": "Update: Thanks for asking so many great questions. My book The Supermajority: How the Supreme Court Divided America comes out next Tuesday, June 6: https://bit.ly/3JatLL9\n\n------\nThe most extreme Supreme Court in decades is on the verge of changing the nation \u2014 again. \n\nIn late June 2022, the Supreme Court changed America, cramming decades of social change into just three days \u2014 a dramatic ending for one of the most consequential terms in U.S. history. That a small group of people has seized so much power and is wielding it so abruptly, energetically, and unwisely, poses a crisis for American democracy. The legitimacy of the Court matters. Its membership matters. These concerns will now be at the center of our politics going forward, and the best way to correct overreach is through public pressure and much-needed reforms.\n\nMore on my upcoming book The Supermajority: How the Supreme Court Divided America: https://bit.ly/3JatLL9\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/UzLqwwC)!",

It seems to me that this question depends on how one understands a justice's \"office\" to be within the meaning of Article III.  Obviously that's a question on which reasonable minds can differ, but the better interpretation seems to be that the \"office\" comprises an active, non-senior seat on the Court.  You appear to disagree.  Can you explain why the \"office\" includes being compelled to adopt senior status?\n\n(Also, to the extent Congress enacts term limits, do you think it likely that this Court would uphold such a statute if it were challenged?)",

It is clever hand waving by OP. \n\nSeniors status also doesn\u2019t really make sense for SCOTUS because every justice hears every case (minus recusals). District and circuit judges obviously do not hear every case that comes through their respective districts or circuits, so they can be assigned reduced workloads.",

Since the the word 'life' is not anywhere in article iii, which simply states that judges ''hold their office during good behavior\", it's a question of legal interpretation and therefore one that should be based in previous case law. Are you basing this on case law? Or just your opinions on how the document should be interpreted?",

It would take a Constitutional amendment to do what OP is suggesting.\n\nRepublicans complained for years that the courts and the bureaucracy were being used to implement policies democrats couldn't get through the legislature or the ballot box. That included all their complaints about decisions, *Roe* being a good example, that even liberal judges like RBG would agree weren't made on a solid legal foundation. The GOP eventually realized this wasn't going to change and worked to get their own majority in the court in order to undo decisions that never should have been made the way they were and to make their own asinine quasi-legal decisions to move policy they prefer. \n\nIt was all fun and games using the court to bypass the legislative/representative process until the GOP was able to appoint their own majority. Now people like OP want to ring their hands and moralize about how this is corrupt, but I know they don't really care about the judiciary being corrupted. I know this because they expressed no problem with the corruption until their political allies were deprived of the power the corruption enabled and only complained when their political rivals were able to exercise these powers.",

It\u2019s true this reform gives justices less discretion over when they take senior status, but it\u2019s Congress, not the justices themselves, that holds the power to define the contours of justices\u2019 duties.",

There was a solid push by democrats to appeal to a conservative base to set the stage for Bill Clinton's election.  This is where we get the classic \"whatabout\" statements such as the one you just made.  The democrat with a conservative stance was referred to at the time as \"Third Way\", or \"New Democrat\" policy, designed to peel voters that had voted solidly Republican for 12 years.  In a sense, conservatives get to have their cake and eat it too.  They got the legislation they wanted, while also getting to stand back and take no ownership for the thing they wanted.\n\nThey (the Clinton campaign) actively used Tipper Gore's time in the PMRC to raise the \"family values\" flag during their campaign, much to the ire of entrenched liberal money sources.\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-07-10-mn-1883-story.html",

It is saying that a country must have a well trained body of fighting men upon whom the country can call. \n\nThe idea that the Second Amendment is referring to rights held by independent chapters/groups/clubs seems, to my historical eye at least, to be a recent political invention by groups looking to reign in gun rights.\n\nAgain, as I stated elsewhere - I don't own a gun, have no intention of doing so, and generally support more gun control.\n\nBut I also have a problem with calling out the conservative justices for being idealogues while simultaneously trying to skirt the Second Amendment's plain meaning by playing fast and loose with history.\n\nIt is possible that the Second Amendment is simply bad law, and needs to be changed to keep up with the times.\n\nBut that would make it still valid law, and seeking to circumvent Congress with wild legal theories would seem to be the same sort of hypocrisy you're accusing the right wing of.",

The constitution doesn't say anything about that. John Marshall, 4th chief justice of the supreme court, invented judicial review (determining whether laws, not cases, are constitutional) in the decision rendered in Marbury vs. Madison. In the last days of his presidency, after losing to Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson, John Adams appointed a bunch of Federalist judges, including William Marbury. Adams's secretary of state was responsible for delivering the commissions to the new judges, but he couldn't deliver all of the commissions in time. Jefferson told his new secretary of state, James Madison, not to deliver the ones that were left.\n\n  \n\n\nMarbury sued, and thanks to the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over the case. The judiciary act set up the federal court system, and gave the supreme court power to issue writs of mandamus, which means \"we command.\" A writ of mandamus is an order to a government official or other court telling them that they must do something. Giving the supreme court original jurisdiction over writ of mandamus cases expanded its powers beyond what was laid out in the constitution, which says what cases the supreme court has original jurisdiction over and that they have appellate jurisdiction over all other cases. John Marshall said it was unconstitutional, and therefore the court couldn't issue the writ requested, even though Marbury was legally entitled to the writ and to his commission.\n\nJefferson was stuck because he was getting what he wanted (not having to give Marbury and the other midnight appointees their judgeships) but the court was grabbing even more power than the ability to issue writs of mandamus gave them, in the form of judicial review. If Marshall had issued the writ as requested, Jefferson and Madison would have just ignored it and made the court look impotent. By giving Jefferson what he wanted but also saying what Jefferson was doing was illegal and at the same time grabbing judicial review for the court, Marshall backed Jefferson into a corner.\n\nJefferson was not happy with the decision because he was not a fan of the concept of judicial review, but he accepted it. I think he probably cursed Adams's secretary of state for not delivering all the commissions in time and setting up the situation for Marbury vs. Madison to happen. The name of that Secretary of State was John Marshall, who was appointed Chief Justice after leaving the Secretary of State job when Jefferson's administration took over. John Marshall, who was a proponent of judicial review and wanted a good case to establish it on. John Marshall, who played Jefferson and Madison like fools by maneuvering them into giving him exactly the case he needed.",

I\u2019ve talked about *Dobbs* and *Bruen*. The third big case was *West Virginia v. EPA*, which sharply curbed the power of regulatory agencies to protect the environment and public health. The regulation at issue was a key climate change plan from the EPA. The Court said that even if Congress had passed a law that authorized an agency to act, it could not do so if it was a \u201cmajor question.\u201d \n\nIn other words, if right wing judges don\u2019t like a rule, they can block it by simply deeming it a \u201cmajor question.\u201dNext term the Court will hear other cases that will make it harder for the government to act. All this reflects the political push from libertarians who have longed for a way to curb government regulation by judges rather than by persuading Congress to repeal environmental laws. \u201cOriginalists\u201d and \u201ctextualists\u201d like to use dictionaries: that\u2019s a dictionary example of \u201coverreaching.\u201d",

That\u2019s not even what *Bruen* was about\u2014not even a little. It was about NY using its (anti-Italian American) *Sullivan Act* to capriciously deny or drag their feet in **issuing carry permits**. Thomas only talks about prohibited places to carry because it was predictably where anti-gun states would pivot next, which is exactly what NY and other states did after *Bruen*. He was just commenting, \u201cand hey, don\u2019t do this now,\u201d but they did anyway. The *Sullivan Act* was to stop undesirable people from going armed, nothing to do with places. \n\nWhat an absolutely joke that you don\u2019t even understand what you\u2019re arguing against. \n\nI guess I just learned that any group can feign authority by labeling themselves \u201cThe [insert anything] Center.\u201d",

Courts resolve ambiguity based on unstated factors all the time because laws cannot possibly enumerate behavior for every situation. That is their function. \n\nAnd as part of resolving ambiguities, they weigh equities, specifically individual rights versus the public interest. This has happened for basically every amendment including the second one. And historically, courts have held that there is a legitimate public interest in limiting gun rights to some degree, because fucking of course there is. This court just went and said \"Nope, the second amendment is absolute, fuck the last century or so of decisions about this, they were all wrong because uh... something about tyranny I guess.\"\n\nIf what you are saying is true, you'd be able to about \"Fire!\" in a crowded theatre because the first amendment says that freedom of speech shall not be infringed upon, and requiring licenses for parades would be unconstitutional because of the constitutional guarantee of freedom of assembly.\n\nThese are two rights are are routinely and very justly balanced against the public interest and safety every day, and the court almost certainly wouldn't entertain challenges to either of those limitations. That's what makes this such a load of bullshit. It's ideological, pure and simple.\n\nThis argument is the kind of thing Elon Musk says to make people think he's smart.",

The Founders disagreed sharply among themselves. More,the Constitution was meant to be a broad charter for a growing country. As Chief Justice John Marshall put it, \u201cIt is a Constitution we are expounding,\u201d not just a statute. Most of all though, it explicitly would turn the clock back. \u201cOriginalism\u201d says we should be governed in 2023 by the social values of property-owning white men in the 1700s or 1800s.

The Constitution and our interpretation of it should reflect that changing country.

The social values of the founders are relevant if one insists that the language of the contract itself isn't clear, as are the historical facts on the ground at that time -- as is the meaning of words and phrases at that time!\n\nJefferson had some cool ideas about tossing constitutions every 19 years so that the living wouldn't be overly beholden to the dead, but he lost that fight. It's a fine moral argument to make, but not a compelling legal one.\n\nIf you want to win some kind of a fight on this argument, focus on just how baldly the \"conservative\" justices on the Court ignore the historical backdrop of the 14th Amendment. That's the winning complaint, right there, for most of the cases that rule in favor of stigmatized minorities and vulnerable populations, and declare that the several states can't fuck with them so much.\n\nIt's not really going to help you when the Court decides to expand an individual civil liberty, though.",

Might want to reconsider your look on guns. Lots of LGBTQ+ and minorities now carry daily to defend themselves. People on the left don't want to be victims anymore, myself included. \n\nMight want to reconsider your privileged view. The only people who think we don't need guns for protection live lives of great privilege and have never needed one.\n\nHave 3 people beat the shit out of you just for being alive while leaving the grocery store and not Caucasian like my Korean buddy had happen to him for giving people \"the China virus\". \n\nThen tell me you don't need a gun. \n\nHave 4 guys beat you almost to death to where you end up in the hospital for weeks because you were gay and just being alive and with your bf in public when you gave him a kiss and they didn't like it. They stomped and kicked them both for 5 mins after beating on them all because they were gay. His bf almost died and he'll probably never walk normally again. This happened to another friend of mine.\n\n Then tell me you don't need a gun.\n\nOr you could be like me and get jumped by 8 people for literally no reason when leaving a bar one night other than for their amusement, after you ran away, they caught you, and you gave them your wallet and phone and they just laughed and threw them aside because they just wanted to beat someone, and have most of the bones in your upper body broken and your skull literally cracked open like an egg. My skull never healed properly, I have a massive lump on the back of my head where it fused together incorrectly and I have problems from that still. A gun would've fucking saved me that night.\n\nThen tell me you don't need a gun. \n\nOr like my other friend who almost got raped when a guy followed her home from the bar, kicked in her front door while she was STILL waiting on the cops, ran up to her bedroom and kicked that door in and was saying he \"just wanted a little taste\" and then she pulled her gun from her purse and he ran off. The police arrived 10 minutes later, and she lives 5 minutes from the fucking police station that has 56 officers. \n\nThen tell me you don't need a gun anymore.\n\nI know 3 other women who actually were raped, one of them in a fucking alley in broad daylight as people walked past and ignored it. 2 of them now carry and one is getting her concealed carry license now after another close call with a creepy fuck. \n\nAll of us now carry daily despite none of us liking guns before these events.\n\nFucking privileged naive little child who doesn't know how the real world works, how shitty it can be and what others go through on a daily basis is what you are, just like all the others who try and take away the right to defend ourselves. Guns are the only thing that keep some people safe. You can't outfight 3 guys who want to rape you in an alley as a 105 pound woman. No one came to her aid that day. Dozens of people walked right past without so much as calling the police. You cant outfight 8 guys like what I went through, and im a big dude who knows how to fight. And you sure as fuck can't wait for the cops to come and save you in those situations. \n\nYou can sit there from your fucking cushy little life safe and sound and say how you don't need a gun so no one else does, but you just come off as a child who hasn't experienced a drop of the shit stew that is humanity.\n\nThis shit right here is why I carry daily, and why I'll fucking die before I give up that right.",

The authors of *Dobbs* said they were just letting the political process work. But many states had laws already on the books, some from decades before *Roe* was decided, that would suddenly ban abortion. And the states that had already enacted the most extreme laws were also the states where gerrymandering has produced the most unrepresentative legislative maps. Texas not only had the earliest abortion ban, it also had the most extreme gerrymandering, as well as among the country\u2019s harshest voting laws.\n\nThat said, we are seeing the political process respond in many places, such as with ballot measure wins in Michigan and Kansas. Now abortion opponents are responding by trying to make it harder for voters to pass such measures (as in Ohio).\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of consistency on this, in any case: the day before Alito\u2019s homage to the democratic process in *Dobbs*, the *Bruen* case struck down potentially hundreds of laws, also passed through the democratic process.

A few times, though, the Court has been extreme, or partisan, or unduly activist. When that happens, there has been a fierce backlash. We saw that after the Dred Scott ruling in 1857, which said Congress could not restrict the spread of slavery in the North. Anger at that propelled Abraham Lincoln to the White House. We saw it in the early 20th century when the Court saw its role as stopping government from protecting workers, women, and public safety in the industrial era. And we are still living through the backlash to the Warren Court, which made major rulings that advanced equality but which provoked decades of conservative organizing. Bottom line: it\u2019s totally appropriate for people to argue about, fight about, vote about the Court. That\u2019s \u201chistory and tradition.\u201d",

Trust in the Court has plummeted to its lowest level ever recorded, according to polls. Partly that\u2019s because of extreme rulings like Dobbs (overturning Roe v. Wade) and Bruen, a radical Second Amendment ruling. Partly it\u2019s the revelations about corruption. A right-wing billionaire has been subsidizing the lifestyle of Justice Thomas, even buying and renovating his mother\u2019s home, all without public disclosure. Bottom line: SCOTUS needs to act like a court.  \n\nWhat can we do? I wrote a whole [book](https://www.brennancenter.org/supermajority-how-supreme-court-divided-america) about that! All throughout history, when the Court overreaches there can be a fierce backlash. Already we\u2019re seeing elections turn on opposition to Dobbs and other extremism. I think this will be a core issue in 2024 and going forward.",

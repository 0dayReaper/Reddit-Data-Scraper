The Pentagon almost certainly already has a list of unneeded bases and expenditures.",

Which I've tried, and I never created a space for good things to enter in, mostly because I only expected them to come in in a certain way and didn't notice them flying by because they didn't meet my requirements.\n\nBut you weren't saying life is an unending slog, I don't think. It's just, bad will happen, as an inevitability. So rather than hide from it or pretend it won't, figure out how to adapt to it so it can't hurt you and build from what you have left.\n\nAll is impermanent, in other words, so happiness and drive must come from within, so life doesn't become too much of a roller coaster or drag you down entirely.\n\nI highly doubt you'll read this, and a few people will probably pick on it because it's likely super obvious to most, but I just wanted to say thank you because it helped me find a bit of strength in a tough time.",

The reason for that is that while everyone here is American, PR\u2019s colonial status prevents us from voting for our Commander-in-Chief.  The US Supreme Court has issued a decision that makes it plain that PR falls under the territorial clause.  Not only that, but in the last local referendum, the preference for statehood was over 60%; present polls show that it approaches 70% approval.  The Commonwealth has fallen under severe financial stress, after Democratic administration after Democratic administration have taken the Commonwealth further and further into debt, while continually raising taxes.  This situation has caused the local economy to contract at a 3-5% clip per annum; and mass migration to the states.  Right now, there are MILLIONS more puerto ricans living in states than in Puerto RIco itself.\nTaking all the foregoing into account, how would you deal with the heart of the problem (Pres. Obama already signed into law PROMESA, which purports to deal with the financial crisis): PR\u2019s colonial status that prevents full voting rights and deprives us of senators and representatives in Congress?",

Yet without him, [we would not have the global debate on surveillance](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2015/06/7-ways-the-world-has-changed-thanks-to-edward-snowden/) that has already led to more stringent protections of our right to privacy. Given that this is a clear cut case of a whistleblower acting in the public interest, would you support a pardon for Edward Snowden? Why?\n\nThank you,  \nTanya O'Carroll - Adviser, Technology and Human Rights - Amnesty International",

Americans pay far more than any other Western nation for healthcare, and it is a leading cause of bankrupcy. What is your plan to address this issue, if elected?\n\n2. What do you feel your strongest states are? Where will you two be campaigning, and where do you think you have the best chance of winning?",

It hasn't been done since 1968, and it's not a coincidence that came with a massive political realignment in the US.\n\nPart of me believes that the last thing the GOP wants to see this election cycle is for Utah to turn gold. I'm sure they're sweating over states like Georgia/Arizona in danger of being flipped by Hillary as well as the other traditional swing states but it's something they can probably stomach in the end.\n\nBut if the GOP loses their safest state to Johnson, that is a DEFCON 1 situation right there. Johnson winning Utah would immediately shift the narrative from, \"How does the GOP rebound in 2020?\" to \"Is the GOP in danger of being replaced by the LP?\"",

If Minnesota decided they wanted their EC votes to go to the tallest candidate, it'd be perfectly within their prerogative to do so. Similarly, if a state wanted to have its EC votes cast for whichever candidate wins the national popular vote, they could do that as well. If 270 votes worth of states decide to do that, then we've effectively gotten rid of the Electoral College in practice.\n\nThere is currently legislation making it's way around the country to do just that.

One of the proposals that I think is a very libertarian proposal, and I'm just open to this, is taxing carbon emission that may have the result of being self-regulating.\u201d\n\nThis was *mistakenly* portrayed by the media and many others that you *support* a Carbon Tax, even though you simply stated your openness to it and the potential benefits of it. It did, however, also add much uncertainty in people\u2019s minds about where you actually stand on the issue and for those that have strong feelings about a Carbon Tax (as with any issue), they favor concrete answers. \n\nA few days later, you attempted to clarify your position during a rally in New Hampshire when you [stated](http://reason.com/blog/2016/08/26/libertarian-gary-johnson-comes-out-again#comment)\u2026\n\n&gt; \u201dIf any of you heard me say I support a carbon tax...Look, I haven't raised a penny of taxes in my political career and neither has Bill [Weld]. We were looking at\u2014I was looking at\u2014what I heard was a carbon fee which from a free-market standpoint would actually address the issue and cost less. I have determined that, you know what, it's a great theory but I don't think it can work, and I've worked my way through that.\u201d\n\nSo my question is this, **WHY** have you come to that conclusion? Can you work the rest of us through your findings of why it can\u2019t work?\n",

As governor of New Mexico, the biggest pollution issue was a plume of chemicals that had been dumped by General Electric there for decades because of their jet engine parts that they were producing in Albuquerque. At the end of the day, literally, someone kicked over a can of solvent that they had been using in their process. And every day they did that, for decades.\n\n&gt; Well, General Electric said, we\u2019re responsible for this. We\u2019re responsible for this plume. The state, before I took office, had been engaged in a debate over how to clean this up. The state prescribing very specific, \u201cHere\u2019s how you have to clean it up, and here\u2019s what it\u2019s going to cost.\u201d And General Electric going, \u201cNo it\u2019s not going to cost that much. We can do it a different way. We can accomplish this cleanup different.\u201d And they never came together. I took office and very simply [said], \u201cGE, how about cleaning it up? It\u2019s going to be measurable. The cleanup will be measurable. We don\u2019t have to come to any terms whatsoever regarding how you do it. Just do it. If what you say is right, do it. It\u2019ll prove itself. You\u2019ll save the money that you\u2019re saying you\u2019ll save.\u201d And all of a sudden, now cleanup started. So immediately we\u2019ve got cleanup taking place. I hope that\u2019s a good example of rules and regulations.\n\n&gt; On the other hand in northern New Mexico, there was a Molycorp mine. There was metals contamination in the Red River. It had gone on for decades. And for decades politically it was being protected because of the jobs that were involved. I took office and I said, you\u2019ve got to clean this up. You have to come to the table and you have to clean this up. They refused to come to the table. So my biggest club in the bag was, I am going to declare you a Superfund site. I\u2019m going to hand you over to federal EPA unless you come to the table in 30 days and come up with a plan for fixing your metals contamination.\n\n&gt; And they claimed that it was natural! It was ludicrous. It was a slap in the face. And they refused to come to the table. My phone is ringing off the hook, politically. It\u2019s ringing off the hook. There were all these jobs. And my response was: \u201cThese people are bad actors and they have to be brought to the table.\u201d Thirty days went by and they became a Superfund site. So there\u2019s an example of the EPA and why the EPA should exist. And why government should exist to protect us against those who would do us harm. And in this case the Libertarian argument would be, as individuals we could have brought suit against polluters. We can bring suit individually. Well, in the case of Molycorp, you know what, they would have been able to withstand any individuals trying to bring that suit against them.",

As a member of the r/ExCons community, a recently re-enfranchised voter, and a brand-new member of the Libertarian Party, I'd like to ask you some questions on criminal justice reform. (I've included some background information, most of which you're probably already aware of; my questions are at the bottom.)\n\n**T**he number of Americans incarcerated has increased from .5 million to 2.5 million since about 1980. That's .7% of the entire US population - *one out of every hundred and forty Americans is currently incarcerated.* Most of these individuals are incarcerated for nonviolent drug offenses, even though drug treatment in prison costs about $30,000, and outside of prison it costs $8,000. Despite the treatment offered, [two thirds of prisoners will reoffend, and over half will be back in prison within a year of release.]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States)\n Resources for ex-offenders are scarce, and many return to a life of crime because it's the only life they know - no one will hire them, [partly for fear of tort lawsuits.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ExCons/comments/4tx9h5/detroits_100000plus_convicted_felons_need_jobs/d5l38co)\n\n\n**I**n addition, the [Innocence Project]( http://www.innocenceproject.org) estimates that 2-5% of all prisoners are factually innocent - a number they reached based on how many they've been able to *prove* were innocent. Not only have they proved innocence, in many cases they've been able to find the real perpetrator, when the police investigation couldn't. \n\n**P**erhaps most egregiously, private prisons have been exposed denying prisoners medical care. A Corrections Corporation of America (formerly Wackenhut) inmate in Louisiana was told he was faking the pain in his hands and feet and ignored for six months until his neighbors complained about the stench. He's since had his fingers and feet amputated, because he had gangrene. [He told his story to an undercover reporter, who got a job as a corrections officer to document abuses.] (http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/cca-private-prisons-corrections-corporation-inmates-investigation-bauer)\n There is little to no oversight over private prisons, and some of the board members are the judges ordering offenders to be sent there. [Here's one notorious example: Mark Ciavarella, who accepted payoffs to send kids to prison.]( http://nypost.com/2014/02/23/film-details-teens-struggles-in-state-detention-in-payoff-scandal/)\n\n**O**ne of the key factors in reducing recidivism is maintaining contact with family and having a support network. However, companies contracting phone service to prisons don't bid based on cheaper service - [they bid based on how much of a kickback they give the state per inmate call.] (http://www.ibtimes.com/why-prison-phone-rates-keep-going-even-though-fcc-regulated-them-2388200)\n It costs someone in prison in my state $15 to call me for 15 minutes.\n\n***\n\nHow will you address these issues?\n\n* Do you have a plan to reduce our incarceration rate, reduce recidivism, and encourage more cost-effective treatment?\n\n* Will you establish oversight and curtail abuses so that private prisons can't deny medical care to save money? \n\n* How will you stop the companies using crony capitalism to profit from the mostly poor families trying to support their incarcerated loved ones?",

Being from another state, I don't know the exact details of what was enacted when, but my understanding is that your state is now subject to some rather overbearing \"assault\" weapons restrictions and to ownership and purchasing permitting requirements for any firearms. This does not jive well with the libertarian mantra, and I've also noticed from various discussion boards that it's preventing a lot of more conservative voters from jumping ship to support you. Obviously, the past is in the past, you've justified your actions then, and your viewpoints are different now. You have stated in past interviews that you are now more wary of such restrictions.\n\nMy question is as follows. Plainly stated, do you still support those measures? If you were governor of Massachusetts today and that legislation was on your desk, would you still sign it? If, in your position as President of the US Senate, it came to you to cast a tie-breaking vote on similar legislation (for example, a renewal of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban), would you vote for or against it? If you ended up in the Oval Office and such legislation came across your desk, would you sign it or veto it?",

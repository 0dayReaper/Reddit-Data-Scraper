    "postText": "Speaking Anxiety can happen when you\u2019re introducing yourself in a group, going around the table giving an update in a meeting, being put on the spot, interviewing for a job, expressing your opinion in a group, reading out loud in class, or giving a speech or presentation. You get the idea - it\u2019s all of those situations where all eyes are on you and you have to speak. In those situations, you may get a rush of fight-or-flight symptoms like heart racing, sweating, shaking, voice quivering, breathlessness, mind going blank, diarrhea, passing out and other bodily symptoms. The symptoms feel uncontrollable and may lead to a full-on panic attack where you have to run from the room. This leads to a spiral of shame, confusion and humiliation. It\u2019s very painful and debilitating. Depending how severe it is, it can make it impossible to graduate from school, interview for jobs, be in relationships and advance your career.\n\nWhen anxiety prevents you from achieving your life goals and decreases your quality of life - that\u2019s when it becomes an Anxiety Disorder. Disorder just means that it\u2019s getting in the way of your happiness and functioning. There should be no stigma around disorders - they should be viewed similarly to a physical illness that gets in the way of your functioning. Here\u2019s a 3-minute video explaining the difference between speaking anxiety and a speaking anxiety disorder:\u00a0 [https://youtu.be/aZKWsKNV2qo](https://youtu.be/aZKWsKNV2qo).\n\nVerification: [https://imgur.com/a/W9eXQyG](https://imgur.com/a/W9eXQyG)\n\nAMA!\n\nYouTube: [youtube.com/@DrCherylMathews](https://youtube.com/@DrCherylMathews)   \nBlogs: [AnxietyHub.org](https://AnxietyHub.org)  \nCourses: [speakmeister.com](https://speakmeister.com) | [Essentials Course](https://speakmeister.com/fear-public-speaking-courses) | [Clubs](https://speakmeister.com/public-speaking-practice) | [LAB](https://speakmeister.com/public-speaking-anxiety-treatment)\n\n**Note Monday May 8 3:00pm EST:** I'll be answering questions Monday-Thursday this week.

You can hear the difference, and it makes you sound more confident. It also helps avoid that feeling like you're yelling. Just feels like louder talking, which is exactly what you want.\n\nI hope that makes sense.",

As OP said all eyes are on you, but really what is coming at you is energy from the audience, the other musicians, the lights shining down on you, even the darkness that you are in when you can\u2019t see the audience because of the lights. You have to learn how to manage and re-direct this energy, and realize that it is positive energy, very rarely will you be in a situation where the listeners don\u2019t want you to succeed. \n\nSpeech class in college taught me how to eliminate things like saying \u201cum, like, and you know\u201d from public speaking, but performing music taught me how to deal with energy, and you do this not only through experience but through extensive preparation. \n\nIt can also be helpful to keep things in perspective, if I\u2019m walking to work and a baby falls out of a window and I catch her, then she grows up to cure cancer, what was the real reason I even went to work that day was it to stress out over a speech or was it to catch the cancer curing baby?",

So if people are not understanding what you're saying, you're not able to express yourself clearly and have a voice. So I would definitely work on that. Get into a speaking practice group so you can get lots of feedback from others \"like I didn't understand what you were saying, can you speak up or enunciate more so I can understand.\" When you go into speaking situations, throw yourself completely into your goal of being understood by others. Keep practicing that.\n\nWhen you very intentionally focus on being understood, you take your attention off of yourself (internal focus which makes you self-conscious) and you redirect your attention externally. Tell yourself \"my goal is to get my message across clearly good enough. It doesn't have to be perfect but people have to understand the key point I'm making.\" This redirects your attention to the present moment. Focusing on something manageable in the present takes your mind off of bad memories from the past and frightening imaginary \"what if\" scenarios in the future. Throw yourself completely into your message. Then give yourself feedback after you speak: I got my key point across clearly good enough - I was successful.\"",

I've seen them on Reddit and MeetUps. Or SpeakMeister Practice Clubs, UltraSpeaking, and Toastmasters. Full disclosure I run the SpeakMeister Clubs and they are focused on anxiety reduction, but it doesn't matter so much where you practice as long as you do the practice (find a group that feels safe)! Find what works for you. Make sure you practice in the medium range of anxiety - nothing overwhelming. Practicing in the high ranges of anxiety will only increase your anxiety. Tell the facilitator what you want to practice so you keep it in the medium range of anxiety.\n\nI would also practice using virtual reality. See [https://anxietyhub.org/vr-training-using-virtual-reality-overcome-anxiety/](https://anxietyhub.org/vr-training-using-virtual-reality-overcome-anxiety/).\n\nIt's also important to go into these practice sessions with some new interpretations and self-talk.

So beta blockers are not ideal for those \"put on the spot\" situations. But some people do take them every day.\n\nThe other options are \"take every day\" meds like SSRI's, etc.\n\nThe problem with meds is they have side effects and they are not a cure. They mask symptoms. When you go off the meds, you relapse.\n\nThat doesn't mean that meds are not helpful - sometimes they are what will keep you afloat.\n\nThe best approach in my opinion is to use meds temporarily if you need them WHILE you're working on the long-term cure. Do the gradual exposure work, and as that takes root, gradually wean yourself off the meds. With the long-term cure, you should see progress after a few weeks/months and more progress at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Keep at it and don't let up. Plan practicing speaking in a safe group for at least a year. The fear center needs time to trust the situation is safe. And if you don't keep at it, the fear will come back.",

                                    "comment": "Another helpful insight from sports psychology is how to manage and reduce performance anxiety. How to manage escalating anxiety and panic attacks when speaking. People who have experienced high anxiety speaking are  worried their anxiety will escalate out of control. (It makes sense because they\u2019ve experienced very painful anxiety escalations). They are focused on the thought \u201cwhat if I have a panic attack\u201d and they imagine vividly that situation happening. Their focus is on horrifying \u201cwhat if\u201d future scenarios. (A panic attack speaking means that the anxiety is in the very high ranges (9\u2019s and 10\u2019s) where you have to leave the room to escape).\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from sport psych and mindfulness to deal with this.\n\nBefore a tennis player serves, they may bounce the tennis ball multiple times. They may do a mindfulness exercise where they examine the seams in the tennis ball intently and non-judgmentally. Then they serve. This focuses their mind on the present moment: What is really happening right now. This takes their focus away from the past and the future where performance anxiety lives. Shame and regret live in the past. Stress and worry live in the future. Shame, regret, stress and worry weigh us down. We can\u2019t perform optimally with all that weight. In our example, the tennis player is not thinking \u201cI just missed the last serve\u201c (past) or \u201cwhat if I miss this serve\u201c (future). They\u2019re intently focusing their attention on the present moment. The present moment is much lighter and allows us to perform to the best of our ability at that moment.\n\nTo prevent panic attacks with public speaking, keep your focus on the message you\u2019re trying to get across (throw yourself entirely into that manageable task in the present moment). That keeps you in the present moment. Keep focused on your goal. If you want to communicate one key point (your goal), focus on that one key point and throw yourself into getting that message across as clearly as possible. Your goal is for your audience to understand what you\u2019re trying to say (good enough - doesn\u2019t have to be perfect). When your mind goes to \u201cwhat if my anxiety escalates and what if I have a panic attack?\u201d Say to yourself \u201cthat is not happening right now. If I focus on my message (instead of focusing on frightening \u201cwhat if\u201d future scenarios), my anxiety will temporarily go up at the beginning but it will come down quickly to a manageable level. I can function with an anxiety spike for 30-60 seconds and then I\u2019ll get into my zone. That additional adrenaline spike at the beginning is extra energy that I can harness to engage my audience. The less I focus on the past and future, the faster my anxiety will go down to a manageable level.\u201d",

It's been measured different ways, with stress and arousal often used interchangeably, and physiological, emotional and psychological \"arousal\", Glucocorticoids have been proposed as a measure, pre-competitive stress measures, 0-10 stress measures, etc. You can think of it as mental activation, adrenaline levels, or how keyed up you are if you want to use laymen's terms.  At very low levels of arousal we're likely to be sleepy, under-engaged, inattentive or we just don't care. Give us a deadline, a cup of coffee, some sense of urgency or importance however and we start to perform better until about 5 out of 10 arousal or stress level. Then we start to slide back down. \n\nIn simple terms, caring too much or too little tends to impair our performance, but a sense of safe challenge, pushing our comfort zone out a little toward the edge of our window of tolerance - we tend to perform better - not throwing us in the deep end beyond where we feel we can cope, not just staying in the shallow end where we're not experiencing any stress at all.",

                    "comment": "OMG I know that situation well! It's so painful. And it's so confusing.\n\nSo here's the thing. You'll never get better by throwing yourself in the deep end of the pool. You have to start at the shallow end of the pool and gradually (with self-compassion) over time work yourself up to the deep end. The fear center in your brain has to trust over time - sometimes over lots of time depending how much trauma there is - that the situation is safe...that you're not going to drown (with speaking, it's be humiliated in public).\n\nI hear a lot of people say practice hasn't worked. But smart strategic practice does work. It has to be gradual. It has to be in the medium range of anxiety (manageable - not overwhelming). Think of ways you can approach the exposures in a very gradual way. Can you start by practicing in front of a video camera? Can you practice using virtual reality [https://anxietyhub.org/vr-training-using-virtual-reality-overcome-anxiety/](https://anxietyhub.org/vr-training-using-virtual-reality-overcome-anxiety/). Can you start a safe practice group on Reddit? What can you do to approach the fearful situation but do it using baby steps that keep your anxiety in the manageable range?\n\nYou also need to go into the practice situation with new interpretations of anxiety, yourself, your audience and the speaking situation. Those anxiety management techniques help you go into the practice situation in a new way so you'll have a different outcome.\n\nI know you can get to that TED Talk! But I have to manage your expectations that it's not quick and easy. It takes a lot of work practicing in the right way and, when there has been trauma as you have experienced, it can take at least a year practicing 3-5 times per week. Each practice session does not need to be long and onerous. You could practice in front of a video camera once or twice a week (15 minutes), do a virtual reality practice once a week (15 minutes), practice with a safe group on Reddit once a week (1 hour)...something like this will start to build confidence. The fear center in your brain has to trust over time that it's safe. Focus on building a database of positive memories around public speaking.",

                            "comment": "Yes it does. A beta blocker is blood pressure medication. It slows your heart rate.\n\nTypically, for those of us who have experienced speaking anxiety in the high ranges, when we feel our heart beat faster, that freaks us out more. That heart racing starts this dialogue in our heads \"Holy crap I'm gonna go off the rails...things are not going well..I'm going to make a fool of myself...anxiety is going out of control.\"\n\nSo the beta blocker can way way reduce the volume on that. It doesn't get rid of it entirely, but it can put a monkey wrench in the escalation process. It can keep the anxiety from escalating. The other way to do this is to change the dialogue that's going on in your head in the first place. But that takes time. So beta blocker in high stakes situations (like at work where you have to stay afloat) while you work on changing the dialogue in your head can be a helpful strategy. Don\u2019t take beta blocker when practicing in a safe group. We want you to attribute your success to yourself and not to the med. Take it in the real life situations where you really need it to keep your job or graduate, but don\u2019t take it when practicing.",

People who were functioning adequately before, for a variety of reasons, are having more trouble functioning in career, school, relationships, life. Wars, trauma and other world events lead to more anxiety disorders. Two, as science advances, the field of mental health gets more adept at diagnosing and identifying anxiety disorders. Three, as society makes it more acceptable to admit you have an anxiety disorder and the stigma is reduced (the stigma should be removed completely), more people who have had anxiety disorders are now counted where they used to be hidden.

I simply thought I was unconfident about public speaking and didn't realize there was an underlying cause. I still remember trying to give a speech for debate club in high school and I completely failed-- It was humiliating and influenced the rest of my life. I have mostly tried to avoid public speaking, which includes avoiding opportunities for advancement.\n\nI think a lot of people just look at us and think we are weird or someone who just fails over and over to prepare for a speech. \n\nAs I said, taking general anxiety medication has helped. Also, while I work in academia where public speaking is required, I generally have a workplace that is supportive of neurodivergent folks. We're all nerds here.",

                    "comment": "Having some anxiety speaking - especially at the beginning - is a normal pattern. Professional public speakers know that they will get some anxiety at the beginning and they come up with coping strategies like memorizing their intro or the first slide. They also interpret that anxiety as excitement (the adrenaline that goes in your body is actually energy). They harness that energy to make their talk more engaging. Because they have a database of positive speaking memories, the adrenaline spikes for a few seconds to a minute and then goes down.\n\n If it's a low stakes event, the adrenaline might spike for a few seconds and then go down. If it's a high stakes event (like a TED Talk), the adrenaline might spike for a minute and then go down. The more adrenaline in your body, the longer it takes to dissipate and go back to homeostasis. The less adrenaline that goes into your body, the quicker your anxiety will go to a manageable level.\n\nThe key difference here is how long in your case before that adrenaline dissipates from your body. When you say a few minutes, is it like 2 minutes? Are you making it through the speaking situation without too much distress or is it distressing and you're afraid you may not be able to make it through?\n\nJust based on what you said, it seems like you're feeling discomfort but that you're managing through it (you're not panicking). It sounds to me like some practice once a week in a safe group would be very helpful. Find or start a group on Reddit where you can practice in a safe way where the stakes are lower. Get really confident in that group and it will spill over into the other situations. This works only if your anxiety is more in the medium range and not the high range. If it's in the high range, it takes some re-education and some very gradual practice in a safe group.\n\nThat's the hardest thing about this type of anxiety is you don't know when it will take you by surprise. Gradual practice in the medium range of anxiety should reduce your anticipatory anxiety.",

The fear center in your brain has to trust over time that the situation is safe. So I would write on a piece of paper situations that cause high anxiety, medium anxiety and lower anxiety. Then go into the low to medium situations and build a database of positive memories.\n\nThink about it like a swimming pool. When you get thrown into the deep end of the pool, you can re-traumatize yourself and your anxiety goes up. But when you start in the shallow end of the pool and work up, you can gradually build trust and confidence that the situation is safe.\n\nI also recommend scrutiny exercises like these: https://youtu.be/FeRw4y0si6I.\n\nYou want to be very kind, gentle and compassionate with yourself.",

I've done exercises like those in the video before but I've noticed it becomes very stressful and difficult depending on location and setting. Is situational social anxiety a thing? I'm fine being more of the center of attention online, or in a store, but when it comes to being at college or a professional setting it is drastically different for me. Maybe this is because being judged in those places could have more perceived consequences compared to casual settings?",

Your anxiety goes down when there is less risk of being negatively judged as explained in this video https://youtu.be/Sucm-6cCL60. \n\nThe most important thing is to do only manageable scrutiny exercises. Write on a piece of paper which scrutiny exercises cause high anxiety, medium anxiety and low anxiety. Then start with the low anxiety exercises. Once you get comfortable and confident with those, go to the medium exercises. Then work your way up. The ultimate \"scrutiny exercise\" for social anxiety and public speaking anxiety is karaoke - so keep that one for the very end once you've worked your way up to it gradually (and with a lot of self-compassion).",

In the comments under that video you'll see some of the similar questions.\n\nSo what you have is called social anxiety. If your social anxiety is high and gets in the way of your life goals, then we could say you have social anxiety disorder. Most people have some social anxiety (low to medium range where it might be uncomfortable but manageable). A smaller percentage of the population has social anxiety disorder where the anxiety gets in the way of functioning well in relationships, career, school, life.\n\nIn certain social situations, you think there is a high risk of being negatively judged so you have higher anxiety. When you're on stage, you don't feel that same risk of being negatively judged, so your anxiety is lower. You may have some bad experiences in some social situations where it was painful or embarrassing. On stage you probably have had very positive experiences.",

I learned that I could actually do something about this and I learned what was in my control. Then I started practicing (gradual exposures) that helped me build confidence. I was so bewildered by this anxiety that I continually researched and studied what the heck was happening. Understanding the causes and how to get out of this trap was really helpful. I went on to become an executive in major corporations and tech startups where I continually faced high-pressure speaking situations. So to answer your question, I got a first boost with the phobia program and then I did a lot of smart exposures (gradual, nothing overwhelming), I changed my interpretations of anxiety itself (anxiety in the low-medium ranges is not bad, anxiety in the high ranges is bad) and I did a deep dive into the research to try to understand. Let me know if that answered your question...cause I could talk about that all day!",

It's probably somewhat out of date now that more research has been done in the area of social anxiety and its treatments, but it was good when I couldn't find really much of anything that was specifically for social anxiety/speaking anxiety. He talked a lot about \"ANTs\", which he used as an acronym for \"automatic negative thoughts\", and wanted people to read out loud a bunch of statements that were kind of like affirmations, designed to help reshape the way that you view anxiety and to take away some of its power over you.",

At a certain point when I was in workplace where I had no choice of gradual exposure but had to meet tons of people, speak at meetings (sometimes 3-4 per day) that I would blush just by seeing someone in the corridor.  I read tons of social anxiety books, I think I can write a PhD thesis :)) but to no avail. What helped me the most is 1) I worked with a therapist on trauma 2) read a lot about shame and trauma, one of the books that helped me understand shame was [https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/98399](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/98399) 3) and this one specifically on social anxiety, I promised myself after so many social anxiety books I read, this is the last one I give a chance :) [https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/40542954-the-solution-to-social-anxiety-break-free-from-the-shyness-that-holds-y](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/40542954-the-solution-to-social-anxiety-break-free-from-the-shyness-that-holds-y)  He has suffered from SA and I think that helps. In the reviews on Amazon you will see people saying he writes mostly about how guys to pick up women, but that is to formalistic. Just use those examples and translate to your concrete situation. He has a youtube channel that helped me through the worst of times when I can freely say I was blushing almost constantly.  The therapy sessions, the books and my determination helped me go through that excruciating period, as the fear of blushing made me have constant mini panic attacks just predicting I will soon blush.  Ironically, once of the most liberating things was to simply accept that I blush and I will blush :)  It is hard for people like us to do so, but once you do, you will see how much it will decrease.  Also, once it happens it will go away faster if you just focus on the conversation except on dwelling and panicking oh my god I am blushing and they all can see :)  If you have a chance to practice gradual exposure as proposed by Dr Mathews, than that is great. I was not so lucky and I still survived. I hope this helps.  Don't give up, it is possible to get better (i thought it was not).",

                    "comment": "Yes, blushing is one of those irritating and annoying anxiety symptoms. Overcoming speaking anxiety is all about learning how to deal with the symptoms and learning how to keep them from escalating to unmanageable anxiety levels.\n\nOne of the core features of speaking anxiety is that we become very internally-focused.\n\n1. We focus on our bodily symptoms continually scanning our body: \u201duh oh, they\u2019re starting\u2026that\u2019s bad\u2026this should not be happening\u2026I\u2019m going to be embarrassed and look like a fool.\u201d  We\u2019re continually monitoring to see if they\u2019re getting worse. We\u2019re also continually sending danger messages to the fear center in our brain (this is bad, this is not going to turn out well). When our fear center receives a danger message, it\u2019s programmed to send a message to our nervous system to release adrenaline into our bodies. The adrenaline is what causes the symptoms. So the symptoms become more intense. Then we send more alarming danger messages to our fear center. Self-perpetuating, escalating cycle. It\u2019s a trap that is hard to escape. Merely trying to think your way out does not work. It takes some new tools and experiential practice to get out.\n2. We have a harsh internal monologue going in our heads. That continually sends danger messages to the fear center.\n\nThis internal focus makes us very self-conscious. We need to practice shifting our focus externally. Focus on the message \u201cI need to deliver three points and if I get those points across good enough (doesn\u2019t have to be perfect), I was successful.\u201d That moves our focus externally, to the present moment (not the past or the future where anxiety lives) and reduces the danger messages. It gives us a concrete goal so we know whether we were successful or not.\n\nThe best way to change this is to have some re-education so you can go into the situation differently with some new tools. And then get into a safe practice group where you can practice these new anxiety management techniques. You need some new tools. Some new ways to interpret the symptoms, yourself, your audience, the situation.\n\nOne technique is to get into a safe practice group (where it\u2019s OK to experiment with new techniques). Before you go into the group, put rouge all over your face. Then practice manageable speaking tasks in the medium/manageable range of anxiety. The more you\u2019re able to desensitize to the red face, the more those symptoms will go away.\n\nYou can start by working on reducing that harsh internal monologue in your head that is continually sending danger messages to your fear center. But there are more tools\u2026too much to go into here.\n\nThe other technique that I\u2019ve heard some people talk about is the v-beam procedure. I don\u2019t know much about it so you can google it. It does not cure the underlying root cause but it helps to alleviate some of the blushing symptoms. It can be a stop-gap measure to get you through your job while you do the re-education and desensitization work that is required to address the root cause.",

Overestimating the cost if something bad does happen.\n\nIt makes sense that we do this because the fear center in our brain in on the lookout for any POSSIBLE danger. It is prone to false alarms. It is going to send a  message to our nervous system JUST IN CASE there is a real danger. Our nervous system is then programmed to release adrenaline into our body JUST IN CASE we need that energy to run from the danger or fight the danger. As explained in this video [https://youtu.be/\\_21jFnb-smo](https://youtu.be/_21jFnb-smo).\n\n\\#1. With flying we have to remind ourselves that there is a 1 in 3.37 billion chance of dying in a commercial airline plane crash - if we're on a major airline with a good safety record. The probability of crashing is low. But in our heads, we're focusing on terrifying imaginary \"what if\" scenarios that are not happening right now and we're telling ourselves \"I\u2019m going to go down in a ball of fire and die a horrible painful death.\" The fear center does not know the difference between a real situation and an imaginary one. So it reacts as if that is really happening. The fight-or-flight response is triggered when we scare ourselves with frightening thoughts. So we have to engage the logical thinking brain and say \"wait a minute, that frightening thing is not happening right now. The probability that it will happen is low. If it does happen, I'll be better able to handle the situation and make better decisions if I'm calm.\"\n\n\\#2. In terms of the cost if something bad happened, 98.6% of crashes did not result in a fatality during 2012-2016 \u2014 Of the 140 plane accidents, only two involved fatalities (1.4%). So if I do crash, I may not die or be injured.\n\nWe can say the same thing with fear of dogs. Are all dogs mean and will bite you? Sure some do bite. But can we learn to manage that risk by asking the owner \"is your dog friendly?\" before we pet it. Can we manage the risk of something bad happening?\n\nSure bad things happen. But with phobias there is an overestimation of the probability and cost. With a fear of flying, that over-estimation might not allow us to visit family and friends easily or travel for our job. It might get in the way of our goals and functioning. So we need to be smart about managing risk. We can't escape risk - even if we stay home. We can't live life without some risk. So let's be smart about it. But let's not over-manage it to the detriment of our quality of life.\n\nThe serenity prayer - or parts of it that are meaningful to you - can be helpful: \"...the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference, living one day at a time; enjoying one moment at a time; taking this world as it is and not as I would have it...\" Reinhold Niebuhr\n\nWith speaking, the fear of having a panic attack or embarrassing ourselves is what keeps us stuck. The more we dwell on that possibility, the more it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and it happens. When you've had a panic attack, that gets seared in your memory, so it makes sense that we dwell on it. One of the tricks is to shift our focus away from those horrifying imaginary \"what if\" scenarios and focus on getting our message across as clearly as possible. Tell yourself \"These imaginary scenarios are not happening right now. If I focus on horrifying imaginary \"what if\" scenarios they will happen so I'm going to shift my focus. I'm going to throw myself completely into the task at hand and I'm going to slow down and communicate my point as clearly as possible.\" You can't always do this in a real-life scenario right off the bat. You may need to go into a safe speaking practice group where you can practice this technique with low pressure. You can\u2019t do it in a high-stakes situation. It takes time, but keep practicing it.\n\nDavid Clark is a world-renowned clinician and researcher in Social Anxiety in the UK. He came up with Attention Shifting Training videos. You may want to try some of these exercises. Keep practicing shifting your attention from internal-focus to external-focus. This can help us move our focus from the imaginary what if scenarios that are not happening to the present moment and what we're trying to accomplish in this moment. Here is his playlist on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjGQ1qp\\_lGNW8OdES0K5plTPvz4pVPp0d](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjGQ1qp_lGNW8OdES0K5plTPvz4pVPp0d). As you do some of these, let me know what you think and if helpful.\n\nThe reason you have fear speaking, but not performing as a musician, is explained in this video: [https://youtu.be/Sucm-6cCL60](https://youtu.be/Sucm-6cCL60). It goes back to over-estimating the probability and cost.",

That was many years ago and I\u2019m not an expert. Many of these professionals who work in this area everyday would be better at answering this question. But I\u2019ll give you my take.\n\nI would expect you to have some anxiety when starting and maintaining a conversation and throughout your recovery. You\u2019re adapting to change and you\u2019re having to redevelop abilities that used to be automatic. You\u2019re going to feel some uncertainty as you go through this and I would expect some stress and worry. But it sounds like the speaking anxiety is not stopping you from speaking and engaging with others. Is the anxiety significantly getting in the way of your functioning in your relationships and life?\n\nAnxiety happens on a continuum. When speaking anxiety is in the low-medium range, it's not bad - it's normal and to be expected. You can function with some speaking anxiety. You can still have loving relationships and a happy successful life with some speaking anxiety and imperfect speech. You can function with it and keep engaging with others despite it.\n\nYou may also want to think about others as friendly and supportive (not everyone is but most are). They actually have lower standards than what you might think and they don't expect perfection. They're more interested in authenticity than perfection. Go into the speaking situation reminding yourself of this.",

Talk with that specialist about speaking anxiety so they can add that to the treatment plan and/or make a referral.\n\n(I don't see introversion as an issue per se. There are many introverts who don't have an issue with speaking anxiety - it's not getting in the way of their functioning or quality of life.)",

I think about CBD the way I would think about the pros and cons of meds.\n\nSee pros and cons of meds: [https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13bo8as/comment/jjck71s/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13bo8as/comment/jjck71s/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). \n\nOne of the biggest disadvantages of meds is that you will attribute your success to the med instead of to yourself. So I think it\u2019s important to get into a safe practice group where you can keep the exercises in the manageable range of anxiety and desensitize. Attribute the success to yourself and not some external factor,\n\nI haven\u2019t wrapped my brain around marijuana for speaking anxiety and I have some mixed thoughts about it.  I personally would gravitate towards a beta blocker and perhaps CBD oil (without the THC in marijuana).\n\nFrom my research into CBD, it seems that it relaxes some people and not other people. Everyone's biology is different so it makes sense that it won't work the same for everyone.\n\nLike meds, Marijuana and CBD oil are not cures. They mask symptoms. But meds may be very important for recovery and improvement.\n\nSome people need meds to stay afloat in their jobs/life WHILE they are on the natural desensitization path. The desensitization path takes time. Many people need a \"flotation device\" when they're thrown in the deep end of the pool in their jobs. It's important that they have some kind of \"flotation device\" in the deep end of the pool otherwise their anxiety will go up and may be re-traumatized. Some kind of meds may be a good stop-gap measure as they're working on the long-term solution. And most people I talk to are super motivated to gradually wean off as they improve.",

                    "comment": "Good question. Pills don't cure anxiety. They just mask symptoms. That doesn't mean they can't be useful in recovery, and sometimes they're a critical part of getting better. When you're thrown into the deep end of the pool, pills can be your flotation device. But I like to think about pills as a stop-gap measure WHILE you're doing the natural desensitization work and cognitive reframing (the real cure). Desensitization (gradual exposures) take time so you may need something that keeps you afloat at work (we don't want you to risk your job) until your desensitization work starts to take root.\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or some of it's different flavors are extremely helpful (as long as you find a (1) well-trained therapist who (2) specializes in the anxiety you have and that (3) you connect well with them [https://anxietyhub.org/anxiety-help-find](https://anxietyhub.org/anxiety-help-find).  People with high anxiety can usually benefit from thinking differently about themselves, their anxiety, the audience and the speaking situation. It helps to understand cognitive distortions and to work on approaching situations more accurately and logically. CBT helps you do that. It helps you go into the fearful situations differently so you can have a different outcome. So yes I think therapy can be helpful. But just talking with a therapist won\u2019t get you over this thing. You have to do the exposures (safe gradual practice). The fear center in your brain learns experientially that the situation is safe. You have to experience it for yourself. You can\u2019t talk your way out or think your way out. You have to think your way out and experience the situation as safe.\n\nUltimately, (#1) smart strategic exposures with some CBT reframing is what helps. Do the (#2) meds if you need them as a stop gap measure while you're working on (#1). With speaking anxiety the med can be a beta blocker (most often used).  Beta blockers are used \"as needed\" so you don't have to take them every day. You take them 30-60 minutes before an event. You have to plan ahead so they don't work well for impromptu situations where you're not expecting to be called on to speak. That's especially where you need the desensitization work.",

Low means there may be some anxiety (mild symptoms) but the speaking task is fairly comfortable. Medium means the symptoms are getting more uncomfortable and may be getting in the way of your ability to speak as effectively as you\u2019d like but you can do it. High anxiety is where your anxious thoughts and symptoms are intense, distressing and are getting in the way of speaking (losing your train of thought, breathlessness, etc.). The majority of the population has low-to-medium anxiety. A smaller unknown percentage of the population has high speaking anxiety that significantly gets in the way of their functioning. There is a lack of research in this area so my best guess is 6-10% of the population has high speaking anxiety (disorder).\n\nEven for people in the low-medium anxiety range, in high stakes situations, their anxiety will be higher. In lower stakes situations, their anxiety will be lower. The level of anxiety you feel depends on how much perceived risk there is of negative judgment: [https://youtu.be/Sucm-6cCL60](https://youtu.be/Sucm-6cCL60).\n\nWe need more research on the speaking anxiety spectrum (low, medium, high).

In and out of therapy my whole life. Mental health issues run in my family but I had a good stable childhood as my parents didn\u2019t have the issues my relatives did.\n\nHowever. I went through two bad car accidents, was a caregiver for a family member who passed away, have second hand trauma from a prior career, and I have medical trauma. All this coupled with my family history has really made life really difficult at times. \n\nI used to take Xanax here and there and then ended up on Klonopin daily which really caused severe side effects and major issues trying to come off of it. It was scary to say the least. I was also on Lexapro for a few years at a time. \n\nAfter years of thinking I could be on meds for sometime and then get off them, I have finally committed to staying on Lexapro, a SSRI for the rest of my life. Meds can delude us into thinking we are well and cured. So we want to stop them, when this is the exact opposite of what we should be doing. \n\nGoing on something long term is something to consider but I know you lack insurance. I also work on controlled breathing when I feel anxious and do guided meditation. Dr. Mao makes a good album I use. \n\nEdit to add I found out he has YouTube and here is one of his guided meditations. https://youtu.be/V-9DPljP9Lc",

All of this is conjecture, but this is the way researchers in social anxiety think about it:\n\nIn our earlier human history, to be ostracized from the tribe was a death sentence. People needed other humans to survive. So a negative evaluation or negative judgment from others triggers a danger alarm in the fear center of our brain. It\u2019s primal and \u201cprogrammed\u201c in our biology. Our nervous system releases adrenaline in our body and our heart starts beating faster and we get other fear symptoms.\n\nThat\u2019s why most people get some anxiety symptoms when speaking in groups or in social situations. We expect some anxiety. It becomes a problem when that anxiety escalates to high levels and prevents us from functioning and realizing our life goals.\n\nAs we\u2019re overcoming public speaking anxiety, it\u2019s important to accept that you might have some normal anxiety. Allow it to happen and don\u2019t fight it. See it as a normal thing.\n\nThinking that you should have no anxiety in those situations, is what makes the anxiety escalate. You think something is wrong when actually it\u2019s quite normal to have some anxiety. You can function with some anxiety. Expect it, allow it, accept it. Don\u2019t fight it.",

I can go to bars and mingle with strangers, I can order food and speak up if something is wrong (nicely), and I can meet up with my friends of friends without any problems.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, when it comes to work, I panic. I get acid reflux, I start coughing, and I feel dread when I need to contribute anything during a team meeting.  This absolutely inhibites my potential for climbing up the ladders internally.  I've literally quit jobs and jumped ship to a new one with a higher title just to avoid dealing with my anxiety at work. \n\nHeres something strange though...   I interview without any issues and I could stand up in a room full of my clients, prepare a speech and wing 80% of it without any sense of dread.  It almost feels like i performing in a play though.   \n\nI have this weird defense mechanism when talking to my coworkers, and when I do have a conversation, there's always that dreaded silence where I can't get past two sentences.  Team happy hour (even remote)?  On-Site get togethers?  Christmas party?  Forget about it... my stomach just flipped right now thinking about the end of the year and how i could give an excuse not to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need help.",

I start to think that maybe they noticed my flaws, not only the ones in my ideas but the ones in my body. Maybe my mouth moved weirdly? Maybe I walked out doing that walk that looks ridiculous? And it gets worse. \"Maybe today I ruined my reputation!\", \"Perhaps everybody felt awkward and now they don't like me very much\". In other words, my participation sends me into an anxious rumination afterwards.\n\nBut, still, I participate, I comment, and **even** debate (that happens rarely, but it does happen). It's just the aftermath that's awful. \n\nDo you have any recommendation for me and anyone that experiences the same thing? Thank you so much!",

            "comment": "*(tl;dr I've put my question in bold near the bottom)*\n\nIt's really interesting to see a more specific singling out of this kind of anxiety! I completely understand what it feels like and on your 1-10 scale presented in the video, I'd say most of my interactions are at around a 6 but with the slightest added element of anxiety, I can easily get pushed past 7. In the past couple years, I've become familiar with the term \"highly sensitive person\" and I immediately identified with being an HSP. I'm guessing there's a lot of overlap when it comes to experiencing speaking anxiety.\n\nSince learning about the HSP trait, I've been making a conscious effort to accept myself as I am and am learning to play to my strengths, while letting go of attachment to optional high-stress situations that I used to put myself into just because they were normalized by society. My self-image and self-esteem are so strong now that I never would have believed it would be possible to feel like this as a teenager (currently in my 30s).\n\nAn example of a change of mindset I've made is to the way I perceive work. Up until learning about the HSP trait, I had only had two jobs: one online-based job requiring virtually no verbal interaction which I held for seven years but which eventually became basically obsolete, and a part-time restaurant job requiring constant interaction which drained me completely even though I only worked weekends. When I felt the need to quit my restaurant job as it just wasn't sustainable, I felt like a huge failure for not being able to do an entry-level job in the most accessible industry for more than 10 hours a week without using the remaining 5 days of my week as solid recovery time. Even remembering the shame now is making me tear up. Luckily, my partner earns enough to support us both but that only made me feel worse about myself. When I learned I was an HSP and could reframe this experience with compassion for myself, it helped me understand that the way I felt in that job was inevitable: it simply was not designed for someone like me. It made me realise that there IS a type of work out there that is suited for me, but it's not as easy to find. Knowing what I was looking for and what to avoid helped me find a new job that I actually think was a perfect fit, though it only lasted a season (I was behind the scenes making ice cream in a specialty shop!) and now I know that putting myself out in the world IS possible. Instead of feeling guilty for being a drain on my partner's bank account, I do my best to live a sustainable life for us both and I can keep looking for another job that I know I will be good at, being grateful that I don't feel financial pressure to put myself in an unsustainable situation again. It feels like self-respect. It feels healthy and empowering.\n\nI know this all has gotten kind of off-topic, but I wanted to make both my struggles and my current position clear before asking this question: **Where do you think the line is between my perceived \"healthy\" tactic of playing to my strengths and actual avoidance that can worsen this anxiety?** Right now, the only life situations that expose me to speaking anxiety are job interviews and necessary phone calls (which I do put off). I've pretty much eliminated all other social situations for the time being (I do occasional 1-on-1 online voice calls with trusted friends and have no problems with family) but I'm having trouble knowing how much is too much when it comes to protecting myself.\n\nSo sorry for this huge comment! Thanks in advance if you end up answering me!",

                    "comment": "Great question! There is a balance. You should protect yourself from high/overwhelming anxiety situations (unsustainable). But you shouldn't over-protect yourself from low-medium anxiety situations. \n\nIf you overprotect yourself from low-medium anxiety situations, your anxiety will increase, and in fact, your anxiety will expand and spill over to more and more situations. \n\nBy approaching the low-medium situations, you'll gradually build up to the higher anxiety-producing situations. Over time, the situations that were once high, will become medium and eventually will become low.\n\nOne way you know whether you are overprotecting yourself is if your world is getting smaller and smaller over time and you're not achieving your life goals and your quality of life is going down over time. If this is happening, take out a piece of paper and write situations that cause high, medium and low anxiety. Now write down actions you can take to safely approach the situations that cause medium-low anxiety. This will start you on the journey to capture your life back.\n\nIt's true that you need to be self-compassionate. And be self-aware enough to know what is sustainable for you. Don't do what is not sustainable, but continue desensitizing in medium-to-low situations so you can have more options and freedom in your life. Accept where you are in the present with self-compassion but keep working on taking your life back. The anxiety makes you a prisoner - keep working on gaining more freedom over the anxiety in a gentle, self-compassionate, and gradual  way (take baby steps).\n\nThe HSP trait can get in the way of your goals and can be changed. It is not your fate or your destiny - you may have a predisposition that way but it doesn't mean it can't be changed if it's having a negative impact on your life. Again it's a balance. Both too much sensitivity and too little sensitivity can be self-defeating. This is where Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy can be very helpful to dig into some of your beliefs and thoughts that could be reframed to be more logical, accurate and true, and to work on some cognitive distortions that are causing the \"**highly** sensitive\". It's good to be sensitive, but highly sensitive can get in your way.\n\nYou said: I've been making a conscious effort to accept myself as I am and am learning to play to my strengths, while letting go of attachment to optional high-stress situations.\" Very good. Be self-compassionate. Don't put yourself into high stress. But do put yourself in medium-to-low stress situations so you don't stay stuck.",

            "comment": "I have had a stutter nearly all my life. Not a typical stutter that anyone has the capacity to experience, I mean a condition that is chronic and always present. As there isn\u2019t a singular cause nor cure, I\u2019m sure it was caused by my teacher. When I was 5 in the summer going from kindergarten to first grade, I moved across the state. The first year of making friends, everything my little 5 year old brain knew, gone. Starting over after your first year is already hard enough. I was always an energetic kid and I talked a lot trying to make new friends (which, looking back, was likely a subconscious attempt at replacing the friends I lost already by moving) and fit in to this new school. This led to me talking too much for my teacher\u2019s liking, and during some instructional period where we were supposed to be quiet, I guess I was talking or something and the teacher walked down the aisle of desks and bent over to get up right next to my ear and do the mad whisper thing and for the first time in my life I had been truly scared of an adult. Just that the teacher flipped so easily on me (she was usually nice and pleasant, although she was middle-aged and for sure a worn soul that was a little more rough around the edges) is what made me so afraid.\n\n\n\nI went home that day perfectly fine, but the next morning when I woke up at 0630, I couldn\u2019t say anything coherent whatsoever. No whole words came out, I was stumbling over everything uncontrollably. I was mortified that I literally lost my ability to speak and my parents were beyond confused about what was wrong with me. I tried over and over but I had never felt so much embarrassment and shame before, and broke down crying. I wrote out what I wanted to say to my parents explaining I couldn\u2019t talk. I didn\u2019t speak for nearly three months. At all. I would go to school and literally didn\u2019t speak because of how ashamed I was. My teacher caught on pretty quickly due to me being completely out of character, energetic and bubbly snd cheery one day and dead silent the next. Toward the end of the year I guess I was making good enough grades to be considered for the GT program and took the test and got in the following year in second grade.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not really sure what happened in between that point of taking the GT test and second grade but shortly after I started it is when I both got put on ADHD medicine (starting with Vivance which made me puke, and next Adderall which I stayed on for the following 5 and a half years until about halfway through 7th grade; I forced myself to stop using it because of the side effects) and was enrolled with the school\u2019s speech proficiency coach to help me control and mitigate my stuttering. I quickly learned to manage it and slowly worked my way back into not being completely self loathing when I spoke (since those three months in first grade passed I would force myself to talk and just power through the stutter up until I learned other methods of controlling it) to my classmates and my teacher, who was a fresh out of college redhead who was in her mid 20s. She was the complete opposite of my first grade teacher, always eager to help and make things enjoyable, and went the extra mile with the job. It was because of her and my GT teacher and the speech proficiency coach that I became comfortable talking again even if I had frequent obstacles.\n\n\n\nFast forward to today, I\u2019m 20 now and have been graduated from high school for nearly 2 years now (a couple weeks away) and have been in the Marine Corps for almost a year and a half. I still have the stutter but after 14 years of dealing with it almost nobody notices until I get nervous where it becomes much more obvious. I don\u2019t handle public speaking very well, or at least when all eyes are on me. Being in the military, the idea that you\u2019re constantly being evaluated isn\u2019t an uncommon thing, and that builds pressure to not screw up what you say when those people ask you to speak. I can get through the talking part just fine but I can\u2019t control my body\u2019s natural response of becoming flushed and palms sweaty and my heart beating much faster, which I fully realize after I sit back down and am left to my own. Is that any sign of any of the two disorders coupled with my stutter? Does the stutter have a tendency to cause such a disorder, and is it really that bad, considering my body reacts that way despite my brain saying I\u2019m fine, that it would be considered a disorder?, or is that degree of nervousness typical for most people already?",

For this question I will use i) public speaking and ii) claustrophobia when flying/taking public transport as an example.  \nSometimes, when I am \u2018forced\u2019 into a situation which I would otherwise avoid, (e.g. i) impromptu presentation at work during a meeting or ii) travelling with a group friends where I can\u2019t escape and requires pre-booking), I can overcome my fear and feel fantastic afterwards. I guess this is somehow through societal expectation or peer pressure in the moment (i.e. i) making the presentation or ii) getting on the transport is less terrifying than making a scene and running away).  \nWhen I\u2019m left to my own devices, I will shy away from volunteering to speak, or I will never book the trip which requires the travel. It feels like I fail before I even get to my boundary because I instinctively avoid things in an automatic and reactionary way.  \nMy world shrinks and the symptoms get worse as you described.  \nIt seems I can do a lot more than I believe, and when the benefit of running away becomes smaller than the benefit of running away, I can achieve a lot more. Is there a way to harness this side (first paragraph) of my fear to push myself to expand my exposures on my own?  \nI hope that makes sense and thanks so much for the time and resources provided.",

The more we can build a database of positive memories around those events, the better. I love how you said \u201c\u2026the benefit of running away becomes smaller than the benefit of [not] running away.\u201d That\u2019s the crux. Avoidance provides short-term relief and a lot of long-term pain (\u201cmy world shrinks\u201d). Avoidance is your anxiety\u2019s best friend. It\u2019s like pouring fuel on the fire - avoidance keeps your anxiety alive and raging. But we need to be smart and strategic about how to approach (not avoid) fearful situations. Find situations where you can be successful in the manageable/medium range of anxiety and approach those repeatedly. Don\u2019t throw yourself in the deep end of the pool where you might traumatize yourself and get the opposite result of what you\u2019re intending. It takes time to desensitize because the fear center in your brain (amygdala) needs to feel confident that it\u2019s a safe situation consistently every time it goes into it. It can take months of repetition to become comfortable. I recommend you write on a piece of paper the speaking situations for you that trigger high, medium and low anxiety. Then systematically and repeatedly approach the situations in the medium range of your anxiety. Everyone has different triggers for medium anxiety so you have to make a list tailored to you. I recommend finding or starting a safe speaking group on Reddit (I\u2019ve seen some that exist already) and practice there in the medium/manageable range of anxiety.",

Everyone has unique experiences to share, and you're a valuable person who deserves to have a voice.\n\nYou may want to think about two cognitive distortions that people with public speaking anxiety and social anxiety often fall into:\n\n1. Filtering. We tend to focus on the negative and ignore the positive. We all do it. The important thing is just to become aware of it. Researchers staged an experiment where they had people with public speaking anxiety present to an audience. They staged the audience so that everyone was smiling and nodding except for one person who was frowning and looked bored. When the researchers interviewed the speakers, the speakers said that the audience was frowning. Somehow they focused on the one negative person and completely missed all of the positive feedback they were getting. Part of overcoming public speaking anxiety has to do with getting **accurate** feedback on your performance. We do a lot of filtering so we're never getting accurate feedback.\n2. Overgeneralization. In this cognitive distortion, you come to a general conclusion based on a single incident or a single piece of evidence. Maybe someone laughed at you once or a few times in some situation, but that doesn't mean all people all the time are laughing at you. People with public speaking anxiety tend to think that others are more hostile and competitive than they really are. Sure there are hostile people out there. But most people are pretty friendly and supportive. They're more interested in authenticity than they are perfection. Start to think about your audience with that new perspective.\n\nGet into a safe speaking practice group. Start getting accurate feedback. I'll bet you start to change the way you're thinking about the situation.",

                    "comment": "Yea, it's interesting you bring that up. Whenever I say \"public speaking anxiety\" most people think presentations and speeches. When I say \"social anxiety\" it covers a lot of social situations but isn't laser focused on speaking in groups of 2 or more. When I say \"go around a table and introduce yourself\" or \"read out loud in front of a class\" that's when that population in the middle comes out and says \"Yea, that's me!\"\n\nI've had people tell me \"I don't have public speaking anxiety exactly - I have speaking anxiety.\" That's when this started evolving for me. I still think it's perfectly fine to describe this as public speaking anxiety and social anxiety. But it's tricky when you try to find keywords on Google that really describe and target this nuanced thing so people in the middle know it's about them.\n\nThe root cause of public speaking anxiety, speaking anxiety and social anxiety is fear of negative judgment by others. Officially in the Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM - classification system), Public speaking anxiety is a type of social anxiety so they are all very connected. Each has different situations that trigger the anxiety.\n\nThis is evolving in my head and I'm still figuring it out. I'm looking for words that communicate as clearly as possible.",

                    "comment": "\"Do you ever have trouble with people trying to eliminate their anxiety entirely?\"\n\nThat is what keeps people stuck. Many people with speaking anxiety and social anxiety make the mistake of thinking \"I should have no anxiety in this situation. Something is wrong, I have some anxiety. I should be perfectly calm, cool and collected.\"\n\nOne of the most important \"re-interpretations\" we need to make is about anxiety itself. Yes, anxiety in the high ranges is bad - it gets in the way of our functioning, happiness and goals. But anxiety in the low-to-medium ranges is to be expected and normal. You can function with anxiety in that range. You can prove this to yourself in a safe practice group. The fear center in your brain needs to learn this **experientially**. It doesn't help to just talk about it - you have to experience it for yourself.\n\nWhen we send the message to the fear center in our brain saying \"something is wrong, I shouldn't be feeling any anxiety,\" that sends a danger message which triggers more adrenaline and intensifies the symptoms. It's a self-perpetuating cycle. Anxiety keeps escalating out of control. But if we say to ourselves \"Some anxiety is normal and fine. I can function with some anxiety. People don't notice anxiety in the low to medium ranges so i don't have to be afraid of people seeing my anxiety\" that keeps the anxiety from escalating.\n\nAnxiety happens on a continuum. It's not all or nothing. We need to accept, allow and expect anxiety in the low to medium ranges. Don't fight the symptoms when you experience it in that range. If you don't fight the symptoms, just let them happen, your anxiety won't escalate and become a self-fulfilling prophecy.",

But her social anxiety is borderline debilitating.  At home with my wife and myself she talks to us and jokes around and seems perfectly normal.  Shes technically my step daughter but I am dad to her and I love the kid with all my heart. We are close and she'll come to me more often than mom when she needs to talk. But the real problem is when she's at school or in public.  At 14 she will break down crying or just lock up and not speak at all in certain situations.  Like having a class presentation, tried a psychologist once and she would say a word. She had a counselor at school she would talk to and our school district had a psychologist that  she would talk to. She gets home and will literally sit with me and talk my head off. I'll sit and just let her talk about whatever for as long as she wants because she doesn't talk to many people outside the hone. She does have a couple if friends but seems so desperate for their attention and acceptance I'm afraid later on in high schooland later this habit may get her into trouble or in situations she was scared to say no to. The school psychologist did her best hut now we want to see if we can find someone to help her,  I guess to be more confident, to be able to talk to people. She's told me she gets scared to upset people.  No matter what I say or advice I give it doesn't really help. I'm glad it helps her feel better to talk to me but us there a type of special children's psychologist we can send her to?  Someone willing to be patient with her in case she just locks up and won't speak thev1st tine she goes? I just want my girl happy and to be able to communicate her feelings, opinions, and thoughts in a healthy and nor.al way so she's no longer scared to try and make new friends and live her life.\n\nEdit: please forgive my grammer and awful spelling!

For example, [https://childmind.org/care/areas-of-expertise/anxiety-disorders-center/social-anxiety-groups/](https://childmind.org/care/areas-of-expertise/anxiety-disorders-center/social-anxiety-groups/) and [https://childmind.org/care/areas-of-expertise/anxiety-disorders-center/selective-mutism-service/](https://childmind.org/care/areas-of-expertise/anxiety-disorders-center/selective-mutism-service/) and [https://selectivemutismcenter.org/whatisselectivemutism](https://selectivemutismcenter.org/whatisselectivemutism)\n3.

                    "comment": "Yea, I used to get that all the time. Couldn't finish my sentence without swallowing, swallowing. It's not an overnight fix. Takes time.\n\nSwallowing is one of those irritating, annoying bodily symptoms that is triggered by the flight-or-flight response (muscles and throat tightening). This is what causes the fight-or-flight response: [https://youtu.be/\\_21jFnb-smo](https://youtu.be/_21jFnb-smo). When the fear center in our brain (amygdala) detects a risk of danger (I might be negatively judged by others), it sends a message to our nervous system which gives our body a shot of adrenaline. When the fear center detects a HIGH DANGER RISK, it sends a message to our nervous system to release **a large dose** of adrenaline into our bodies. The more adrenaline, the more intense our symptoms.\n\nVery simply, the way to stop this is for your fear center to stop sending danger risk messages to your nervous system. The only way to train your fear center is experientially: You have to repeatedly go into the fearful situation safely and successfully and build a database of positive memories with that situation. It's all about keeping the amount of adrenaline in your body to a minimum (to a manageable level). You can speak when the adrenaline is at a manageable level, but the adrenaline completely hijacks you when it's at higher levels.\n\nGet into a safe speaking practice group. Find one or start one on Reddit. Start practicing things that are in the manageable range of anxiety for you. Then work up.\n\nAlso, do progressive muscle relaxation before you speak. That will loosen up the muscles in your chest and throat. See Johns Hopkins video on how to do it [https://youtu.be/ClqPtWzozXs](https://youtu.be/ClqPtWzozXs). I always squeeze my fists and release before I speak (I can do it in my chair before I'm about to speak).\n\nAlso, always have water handy. Give yourself permission to stop and drink some water before you start speaking and during.\n\nSlow your speaking pace down - this relaxes your nervous system. If it creates more anxiety at first, just keep practicing it in front of a video camera. Learn to tolerate slowing down and pausing.\n\nThis is tangential, but I figured out that I was allergic to milk and cheese. Once I cut those out, I was able to get a handle on this symptom. What used to happen is that the swallowing was severe and that symptom would freak me out \"Crap, I'm about to have a panic attack..things are going to go off the rails..). So when I was able to reduce the intensity of that symptom by avoiding some dairy, I was able to stop the anxiety from escalating out of control. Hope that makes sense! But really getting rid of this was a confluence of several things and several years: Safe practice in groups and re-interpreting anxiety, myself, the audience and the speaking situation.",

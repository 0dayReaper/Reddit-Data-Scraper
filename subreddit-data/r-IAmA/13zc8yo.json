    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m a 22 yr old female and I was born with an extra clitoris! Yes, that means I was born with TWO! \n\nASK ME ANYTHING! \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/7TOfzwu\n\nMy doctor decided the best way to confirm my anomaly would be through biopsying a sample of tissue. Even though it did pose a high risk of the desensitization, this would confirm 100% that I indeed was born with two clitorises (besides it being visually obvious).\nAs expected, the biopsy results came back confirming erectile tissue was connected and present, making me the fourth case of having a duplicated clitoris ever documented.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/QfwsgtA\n\nVisually, the best way I can describe what it looks like is two peas in a pod. Both of my clitorises are underneath one hood. If inclined to see a picture, I have posted pictures. There is a link in my bio to those pictures.\n\nI just started a TikTok and am making more educational videos and videos answering more in depth questions!

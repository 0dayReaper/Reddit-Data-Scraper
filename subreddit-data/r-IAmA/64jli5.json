How did you respond to them?\n3. What did the police say to you when they first approached you?\n4. How did you respond to them?\n5. What were the consequences of you not arriving at your destination when planned?",

Certainly that security guard had no reason to slam a man's face who was peacefully resisting. \n\nThis doctor is going to get a multi-million dollar payout. Personally, I'd also demand the resignation of the guy who hit me, of his supervisor, the gate staff, and their supervisor. There must have been a dozen people who royally screwed up here. Then doubly, I'd demand compensation for everyone on the airplane who had to witness it, to cover their emotional distress. ",

Passengers were allowed to board the flight and once the flight was filled those on the plane were told that four people needed to give up their seats to stand-by United employees that needed to be in Louisville on Monday for a flight. Passengers were told that the flight would not take off until the United crew had seats and the offer was increased to $800, but no one volunteered.\" \"Then a manager came aboard the plane and said a computer would select four people to be taken off the flight. One couple was selected first and left the airplane before the man in the video was confronted. The man became \"very upset\" and said that he was a doctor who needed to see patients at a hospital in the morning. The manager told him that security would be called if he did not leave willingly, and the man said he was calling his lawyer. One security official came and spoke with him, and then another security officer came when he still refused. Then a third security official came on the plane and threw the passenger against the armrest before dragging him out of the plane.\"",

From what I understand, their statistics showed them that, on average, about 1% of rooms were no-shows. So you have a choice - overbook by that percentage, or just let it happen and potentially not make money on those spots.\n\nWhen it happened, people were usually irritated (and rightly so), but the hotel would take care of them. They'd put them in a competitor's hotel for the night, free of charge, and if they were staying for multiple days they would upgrade their room. Again, free of charge.\n\nI don't think the issue is with overbooking, it's with how they handled it when no one was interested in giving up their spot.",

If you build your empire upon overbooking, you can't blame a customer when everyone shows up. Even worse, its for people on standby. United is run by an imbecile and someone is going to get fired for 'following orders'.",

You can't just do the overbooking and then cheap out on the compensation. If you're unwilling to pay enough to get people to voluntarily give up the flight they bought, then maybe overbooking that much isn't actually a good decision.\n\nIt's like mining companies that want to use cheaper, sloppier mining practices and then not pay for the cleanup. It's a package decision, you can't be allowed to just take money by screwing everyone else over. ",

He's disoriented and repeating himself.  If those are fleeting symptoms, this is probably not a huge case (although it will settle for a premium due to the publicity).  \n\nHowever, if his post-concussive symptoms do not dissipate and he sustains memory issues or any other long-term mild traumatic brain injury symptoms--given his profession and loss of earnings capacity--this would be a very, very significant potential claim/suit.\n\nSource: Am personal injury attorney (only licensed in California, this post is educational in nature and is not intended as legal advice to anyone)",

Though the plane is now only half full, the overhead bins are currently all at capacity due to the overstuffed carry-ons packed by selfish and/or cheap people just as we intended when we decided that bringing your belongings on a trip should require a surcharge. We request that those passengers currently boarding with luggage kindly stop in the aisle and attempt to wiggle back through the aisle to the front of the plane where we will be happy to place a paper tag on your bag and chuck it under a plane -- maybe this plane -- for you free of charge.\n\nThis plane is equipped with six emergency exits; two doors in the rear, two over-wing exits, and two doors at the front of the plane. In the event of an emergency, follow flight crew instructions and do not open an exit until directed. In the event of a non-emergency, this plane is equipped with 325 aluminum-frame chairs that can be used as bludgeoning tools should you fail to comply with instructions or, you know, raise your expectations.\n\nFederal law prohibits tampering, disabling, or destroying lavatory smoke detectors. All passengers are required to comply with crewmember instructions. You shall comply.\n\nWe know you have a choice in which airline treats you as subhuman scum, so on behalf of our Chicago-based flight crew, thank you for paying United.",

Shoulda offered 2 grand, 3 grand, 4 thousand bucks. I bet someone would have taken that deal in a heartbeat. The deep shit that United is now in and the major PR hit they are taking is going to cost them a hell of a lot more than a few thousand dollars. ",

    "postText": "Hey Everyone.  I'm back to answer some more questions and to let you know that I'm involved in a campaign to sell some #DammitJerry t'shirts/hoodies/mugs to support the #TuberousSclerosisAlliance.  This organization helps children born with tumors on their organs who very sadly end up having numerous seizures throughout the day for most of their lives.  It's a wonderful group of people and I'm always happy to do anything I can to help this awesome cause.  Please go to www.Represent.com/Jim and get your #DammitJerry swag.  :)  Now, bring on the questions.  :)\n\n\n\nWell, I've gotta get ready for my FB Live with Josh McDermott.  We'll be live at 3PM PST.  Please check us out and ask whatever questions you might have.  I'll also be with Andrew J. West at the Laemmle's on Wilshire in Beverly Hills at 7:30pm for the screening of Middle Man.  Go to their website for tix.  We'll be doing a Q&amp;A after the film.\n\nI want to thank you all for taking the time to either ask questions or check out the answers.  I love doing these kind of things.  I think they're much more revealing than your average interview.  REDDIT is one of the greatest places for information about ... anything.  Literally anything.  \n\nI'm heading to Boston tomorrow to go to the 7:30pm screening of Middle Man at the Boston Common 19 on Tremont Street.  I'll also by in NYC on Tuesday at the Empire Theater on 42nd to meet people at the 7:30pm (I think...if not around that time) where we'll also be doing a Q&amp;A with me and director Ned Crowley.\n\nPlease check me out on The Late Late Show with Seth Meyers next Wednesday, the 14th.  Seth is one of the really good guys.  I love being on his show.\n\nAgain, thank you for all the great questions and taking the time out to spend with me.  I'm forever astounded and grateful for the love I'm shown every day.\n\nxoxoxo\nJim\n\n\n\n\nEDIT 1: Hey everyone.  I have to do a phone interview at 11 PST.  I'll be back after we hang up.  In the mean time check out the trailer for Middle Man.  I promise you a thrilling, dark, funny ride with this film:\n\nhttp://www.middlemanmovie.com/trailer-1/\n\nHey Reddit! \nThank you for having me back! I think this is going to be my third AMA, so the answers should hopefully come a little faster this time. I have a new independent film called \"Middle Man\"  which is opening in theaters today. It's a super dark comedy that I'm extremely proud of. It's been on the festival circuit (and has done very well!) so I'm sure a few people here may have already seen it. If so, no spoilers! Lol. \n\nIn the film, I play a comedian named Lenny. When Lenny's mother suddenly dies, he quits his job and heads to Vegas in search of fame. He picks up a mysterious hitchhiker who lures him into a desert-town killing spree with dark and twisted result \u2013 as the bodies pile up, Lenny actually becomes funnier and funnier.\n\nHere's a link to the trailer. I hope you like it! http://www.middlemanmovie.com/trailer-1/\n\nHere's me and my doggos for \"proof\"  http://imgur.com/a/4Ti7B\n\nI will be back in about two hours to answer your questions.\nThanks Reddit!",

The episode where Jerry retires and Leslie comes over to talk with him because she felt like they didn't give him a good farewell was one of my favorites.  Leslie sees how Jerry is adored by h is family.  She also sees that he's awesome around his house.  He's funny, smart, quick reflexes.  Leslie acts likes she's been thrown to some other dimension.  The writers on Parks always knew how to handle each situation.  I thought it was a brilliant idea.  :)",

I guess that's why I love parks and Rec. when I'm feeling down, I can watch it and just feel better.",

That and his hot wife.  \n\nI always wondered how actors with characters like this can compartmentalize the experience of being verbally/psychologically abused.  I mean, I know it isn't real but the writers are making fun of their physical representation of the character which is their actual physical appearance IRL.  \n\nI am guessing it is easier for adult actors but what about younger ones who are still developing psychologically?  For example, Anne from Arrested Development.  There were some really cutting comments about her on that show and I have to assume it stung a bit. ",

When they're making fun of a characters physical attributes they are also making fun of the actors in a way.  Personally I've never been bothered by it.

Not only were you kind enough to introduce yourself and my friend and I stared at you in awe, but you took the time to take a picture with us when the show was over since we weren't allowed to take them in the theater. You were so kind and willing to talk to two awkward 18 year olds so I just wanted to thank you, two years later!\n\nMy question is: what's your favorite encounter you've had with a fan?",

I can honestly say that part of the 99% is the interaction I have with the fans.  I know a lot of actors aren't happy to stop and talk with their fans but I'm always happy to take pics and chat a little.  There were many MANY years as a working actor that nobody knew who the hell I was.  The fact that I was lucky enough to land a show like Parks and get to have an impact on peoples lives is something I will never take for granted.  I'm honored (and humbled) that people like my work and want to come up to let me know.\n\nFor those wondering what the 1% is that isn't so great...people sneaking pictures.  I would rather have someone come up and ask for a pic than sneak around trying to get it.  For some reason that seems much more invasive to me.  :)",

I spent six years (7 seasons) with the greatest cast and crew that has ever been assembled (in my humble opinion).  Thankfully the cast are constantly texting each other and staying in touch.  I keep in touch with a lot of the crew too.  That being said...nothing will ever be like going to work every day to laugh with people you truly loved.\n\nAs far as people being different from their characters...As actors I think we all bring a certain part of ourselves to every role.  It's just natural.  Nick Offerman is a smart man who can build anything.  So that's like Ron.  On the other hand I think politically they might be at odds.  ",

Is there one movie or TV show you've been in -- other than *Middle Man* -- that you'd recommend to people looking to see a little more of you? A performance you're particularly proud of?",

Because of the popularity of Parks I'll always be best known as Jerry which is a gift.  I love when I get to sink my teeth into a dramatic role.  Dark comedies are my favorites.  It's one of the things that led me to Middle Man.  I'm not the \"funny\" guy in the film yet I get a lot of laughs.  I love getting a new script and figuring out what I'm going to do with it.  \n\nAs far as finding something I did in the past...hmmm...I did an episode of Diagnosis Murder where I got to play a crazed serial killer.  I had a lot of fun with that.  I would also check out a remake of Harvey I did many years ago with Leslie Nielsen, Swoosie Kurtz and Harry Anderson.  It was one of my first films.  I look like a baby.  It was an amazing experience.  :)",

For example he didn't have a mustache and tried to avoid all questions about Parks &amp; Rec. Really cool and funny dude though and I'd highly recommend reading his book - I saw him before getting into the show so I didn't have a lot of knowledge about him going into it. Can also confirm he has a firm handshake! ",

I knew within two minutes of meeting him that he needed to be with me for the rest of his life.  A few months later I went to the Amanda Foundation and met Stella.

Amy had just come off of an amazing run on SNL as well as a couple of awesome films.  My agent called and said that I had an audition for the show for the role of Ron Swanson.  I found out later that most male actors in LA audition for the role.  The thought of anyone playing Ron Swanson other than Nick Offerman is ridiculous.  I think Nick was always who they wanted but the studio made them read tons of people.  That is what helped me.  Though I didn't get the role of Ron they did see something they liked and brought me back in for Jerry.  The producers tell the story that after my Jerry read they just said \"He's funny.  Let's put him at a desk.  It'll work itself out\".  \n\nAs far as my audition for Ron Swanson I don't remember exactly what I did but for I do remember being very stern.  Probably too stern.  As much as Ron was a ballbuster he was also a softy.  I should try and see if I could get a copy of my audition.  I'm sure it's horribly embarrassing but it would be a great to see.  :)",

We'll have to do this again sometime.\n\n-------\n\nUpdate: Welp, not sure what exactly happened, but I'm grateful to the 7ish people who did comment! Y'all are the real mvps.\n\nSince I'm not up to much, I'm going to keep the AmA open until sometime this evening. If you've come in late and still want to ask something, go for it!\n\n-------\n\nHello! My name is Evan Kice, I\u2019m the solo developer for Afterplace, and adventurous open-world mobile game with silly characters and terrible secrets. I spent the last four years designing, programming, drawing, writing, and composing every part of the game myself. I went to collage for software engineering, so programming was the only part of game development that I knew going into this project - the rest I learned along the way!\n\nOn Monday, I was honored to receive the Apple Design Award for Delight and Fun, something I never dreamed of when I started all this!\n\nAsk me anything about solo developing a game, Afterplace, or anything tangentially related!\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/QyUpGZI)!",

Those are my next project after localization and postgame content.\n\nAs for a full sequel, I do love the world of Afterplace, and would be happy to make another game in it if a good story allows for it. If I made a sequel or a game though, it would probably look or play much different. I love this incredibly small pixel style, but I'm reaching hard limits on the amount of expressive storytelling it permits.",

If I did not have a wonderful spouse to support me, I probably would have just cut down on living expenses as much as possible to focus on game dev. Maybe worked out of a tiny house or camper van for a few years until I made money. But that's just speculation.",

That way you always run into fun interactions regardless of what direction you wander!",

Monsters and environments work well without communicating with each other, so the biggest issues were really just \"what order(s) can the player talk to NPCs in\". I would occasionally have to make little flowcharts that let me know what all was interactive in what order, then make sure to have contingencies for each.\n\nFore example, you can &gt;!do the whole library before talking to Joxxi in town, so there are routes where you happen upon Joxxi in the library IF you met them in town, or if you already beat the librarian, it puts them directly at the crossroads!&lt;.\n\nAs for bugs, I do my best to have well organized code (doesn't have to be fancy, just has to be well labeled and such), but I do occasionally just have to run through my whole game, because weird bugs do always get in.",

Most of the melodies were trial and error, and then I used youtube tutorials for \"how to make future bass / edm / horror / etc\" to get those melodies to be full songs. Everything was done in FL Studio.\n\nIn terms of inspirations, I mostly listen to the Hyper Potions / Shawn Wasabi / Subtract side of future bass, so most of it came from that. \n\nAs an extra fun fact, I came up with the entire premise of floating islands and giant machines and other worlds by listening to Porter Robinson's 'Worlds'. Actually, I borrowed the progression for my trailer from \"Goodby to a World\", where a simple melody starts and a completely different one slowly fades in on top of it. Great album, I highly recommend it.",

There are definitely quite a few things I would have liked to have added - I probably have a hundred trello cards of cut content, but not all of it would work congruently in the same game. So, good material for future games!\n\nAt one point I wanted to have this whole side quest where if you spent too much money in town it would crash the economy, and stores would start inflating prices, but only for you. The ranen store clerk would try to sell you things at lower prices in a back alleyway, but if you bought too much from them they would become some sort of rich mogul and take over the town. Obviously a lot of work, but also I made the money you got from chests an enemies in the game too\u2026 well? No one ever had more money than what they needed at any given time, so the whole premise kind of fell through. Maybe if I ever do a big RPG with lots and lots of side quests. XD\n\nI also wanted to add about 100 more areas to the surreal with just ridiculous stuff in it, but beta testers said it was already way too confusing to navigate.",

That means, take your idea, make a little prototype that highlights your idea, show it to friends/family/people on the internet, get feedback, decide what parts of your idea are good and bad, and then do it again! You will want to do this several times, so don't put a ton of work into the prototypes, just enough to get your point across. This way you can be confident that your idea is decent before spending 2-4 years on it! (Afterplace was 4 years, to answer your other question)\n\nAfterplace started out as a little \"I want zelda but on touchscreens\" demo, then I played with the mechanics for several months until I trusted they would work, THEN I started on a story. But, I've done it the other way around too, making little story-based projects then building mechanics that match (though the mechanics still needed to be prototyped). Just don't get caught up in the design docs, or the tech, or the 'what ifs' to start, have an idea and play around in a game engine until you like it or decide on a better one.",

Influences for Afterplace are (obviously) the older top-down Zeldas, but games like Hyper Light Drifter, Titan Souls, and Hollow Knight played a big role in the feel and movement of the game. Secret of Mana was another huge part of my childhood and had a big impact on world feel. Cave Story is actually probably the biggest influence to how the narrative works, with very little given up front. Undertale was an influence on me in general, but I did try my best not let my story or comedy sway too close to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a decent Ghibli fan, so a lot of the strange or surreal environments may have been influenced by that.

As an aspiring iOS developer can you give any recommendations for resources, tutorials, or a roadmap that helped you on your journey? Thank you and congrats again on the hugely successful launch of Afterplace!",

                    "comment": "Thank you! While Apple has been one of my biggest proponents, I am actually both an iOS and Android dev (really a Unity dev and it does all the other work for me). I chose mobile for this specific project because I really loved my gameboy as a kid. Mobile phones are kind of the gameboy of the present, I think more so than things like switch or steam deck. We have these amazingly superpowered devices on us at all times, and it's really saddening that we don't use them for gaming (or at least, the type of indie gaming I love and enjoy).\n\nAs for recommendations and resources, I got most of my knowledge and skills for development from youtube. You can find tutorials for art, music, design, anything. I recommend starting with design channels like Adam Millard, Daryl Talks Games, and GMTK. Swift looks great and I'm sure it's a blast to work in, but Unity is also a great start for an engine, there's tons of tutorials and you will be able to port your game to other platforms in the future. And the best resource is always just trying things yourself! Unity is free, download it and poke around, you'll learn skills and get fun ideas for future projects!",

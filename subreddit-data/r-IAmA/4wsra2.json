    "postText": "Hello Reddit!\nI\u2019m Sean Murray, and I\u2019m one part of a small indie dev called Hello Games.\n\nI joined the industry straight out of Uni, worked for three years, became a technical director, lost my way, quit and made a game with my friends. That was Joe Danger. Tomorrow we're releasing our next game called No Man's Sky.\n\nYou can read about it here:\nhttp://www.no-mans-sky.com/2016/08/what-do-you-do-in-no-mans-sky/\n\nIt's a chill sci-fi game.\n\nI can\u2019t really describe in words what today feels like... but let's go with weird and terrifying. \n\nMy specialist subjects are programming, indie development, working at EA, not sleeping, maths, hype-trains, drinking tea and stressing about your game releasing... Ask Me Anything!\n\nProof here\u2026\nhttps://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/762769098614923265\n\n&lt;3\n\nEDIT! Thank you everyone! I'm gonna do another half hour and then try to get some sleep :)\n\nEDIT! Leaving now because people pointed out we might overtake Obama as the most popular AMA. If that happens someone might start to worry that the hype has gone too far \u00af\\\\_(\u30b7)_/\u00af - thank you all so much! Hope you enjoy the game, I'm going to try to sneak off into anonymity now",

We're still sort of the underdog with Sony, and in the general AAA (for obvious reasons). If NMS is a success, I think that probably will have a real impact in terms of how a lot of people in larger publishers view indie games. People generally think of NMS as a Sony title, but we're still just a self funded indie studio - it's kind of a crazy situation :)",

We'll order a big plate of Pommes Frites to start. One will fall into your beard and you won't notice. We'll share a laugh over that. Then we'll take a risk and order escargot but both chicken out when it arrives. We'll skip to dessert. \n\nWe'll walk around Guildford after and chat. You'll talk about your youth in the wilderness of Australia and tell stories about writing code. I'll talk about growing up in the urban jungle of a major American city and tell stories about writing fan fics about you. Someone on the street will harass you about increased FOV and I'll defend how hard you're working and make them apologize and/or run off crying. \n\nI'll walk you back to your car. You'll look me in my eyes and think how surprisingly witty and kind I am. This was all just a stunt to one-up the person writing uncomfortable fan fiction about you, but... looking at me that night will make you feel unlike you ever have before. Against your better judgement, you'll lean in for a kiss. I'll stop you an inch from my lips. \"Whoa there bud, this was all purely platonic, I'm sorry if my erotic fan fiction gave you the wrong idea,\" I'll say. \"Oh yeah, I knew that,\" you'll stutter out, avoiding eye contact as you get in your car. I'll grab the car door just before you shut it. \"Sean,\" I'll say softly, \"Thank you.\" You'll nod and smile gently before driving off. \n\nWe'll exchange a text or two later but I'll eventually delete your contact on my phone. I'll move on to writing weird fan fiction about another quirky visionary like Elon Musk. You'll forget about me mostly, but occasionally pull up one of my stories on lonely, late nights at the office. \n\nOn second thought, maybe we should do sushi instead. ",

With NMS gaining so much traction - despite its indie status on PS4 it's being given the billing of a major AAA title - would you consider expanding HelloGames into a multi-project studio, or do you prefer more of a Pixar/Naughty Dog single-game style environment?",

I think video games is just such a largely unexplored field. There's very few studios that pull off the two game thing, but supporting one game and then kicking off something new - that's doable right?\n\nSh*t, I just remembered, we've got another thing we're already working on that's unannounced. It's a small experiment, but hopefully you all might like it :)\n\nMaybe we can be the Johnny Depp of studios :D - do a mixture of big stuff and indie stuff? :D",

It's so great to finally have the opportunity to ask questions, its been a long time coming! \n\nYou mention being tight-lipped on the PC version, and you've got your reasons, but will you be tight lipped in this AMA? I'm very interested to know how the PC version has been coming along, and what settings we'll have access to. \n\nSide-question, you mentioned years ago that you hadn't found a planet you'd rather live on than Earth (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0uYnwqlslU) - has this changed?

Man, you would surprised how wrapped up most devs are in contracts and nonesense. Often for instance lots of devs will have a clause that says \"you literally can't say the name of platform X\". Knowing this it's really funny watching interviews where devs are squirming trying not to the word Wii or whatever when being asked about some industry thing :) - you see us say things like \"well the thing about supporting... that particular console is...\"",

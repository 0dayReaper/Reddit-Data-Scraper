    "postText": "**My short bio:** I completed an AMA a number of years ago, it was a lot of fun and thought I'd try another one. I train working Border Collies to help on my sheep farm in central Iowa and compete in sheepdog trials and within the last two years have taken on students and outside client dogs. I grew up with Border Collies as pet farm dogs but started training them to work sheep when I got my first one as an adult fifteen years ago. Fifteen years, a lot of dogs, ten acres, a couple dozen sheep, and thousands of miles traveled, it is truly my passion and drives nearly everything I do. I do demonstrations for university and 4-H students, I am active in local associations and nominated to serve on a national association. I've competed in USBCHA sheepdog trials all over the midwest, as far east as Kentucky and west as Wyoming. Last year we qualified for the National Sheepdog Finals\n\nAsk me anything!\n\n**My Proof:** [My top competing dog, Kess](https://i.imgur.com/S5r2eu0.jpg)\n\n[JaderBug.12 on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@jaderbug.12)\n\n[Training my youngest](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogswithjobs/comments/12jwxd5/peach_my_15mo_old_prospect_working_on_driving_and/)\n\nFeel free to browse any of my submitted posts, they're almost all sheepdog related",

For instance, I play a lot of tug with my dog. He can't really play fetch the traditional way because he goes WAY to hard at it and rips up his paws (we play on soft grass). So he plays tug and I give him commands when his drive is peaked. I tell him to drop the tug, perform tricks, go to specific places, then come back and continue. Him having to temper his drive from peak to low tires him out fast. \n\nThe important thing though is that he ALWAYS wins at tug to boost his confidence and ensure that he's doing the right thing. Behind all of this is the establishment of the fact that the tug and ball (his two absolute favorite things in the world) are MY toys and I'm allowing him to play with them. He doesn't just have open access to them.",

The instincts and traits it takes for a dog to be a capable herding dog are directly contradicting to the instincts and traits it takes to be a quality guardian dog. Herding works off of prey drive (which you don't want in an LGD), livestock guardian work comes from protection drive (which isn't what herding dogs work from). The two traits cannot functionally exist in the same dog. You might find a dog like an English Shepherd that kind of? does both, but doesn't do very well at either. English Shepherds are kind of an all around farm dog. Jack of all trades, master of none.",

The dogs we think of as really smart are the ones that really CARE about pleasing you -- so they concentrate on what you want.\n3. This one is kind of hard to put in words -- but a 3 year old human is only a three year old for a year. They don't have any experience with the world. A 5 year old dog has been as smart as a 3 year old for 3 or 4 years. They have observed the world, made connections between things while focussing on how to please you and remembering previous situations.\n\nThe last one is really important -- I have also heard dogs are as smart as 4 year olds, but that part isn't what matters -- it's that they have the time to build up way more knowledge than a 3 or 4 year old child would be able to collect. A dog can look at the shoes you're putting on and work out if you're going to work, going for a short walk around the neighborhood, or going for a hike. Our Aussie knows from the drawers we open if we're getting out workout clothes or work clothes. Human children at 3 or 4 just aren't as focussed on you and haven't had time to accumulate that kind of knowledge about their world.",

Herding ability is extremely fickle and is easy to lose even when you're breeding for it, so when a breed hasn't been maintained as a working dog, it's lost. \n\nAKC programs are notorious for using 'dead broke stock' which means sheep that aren't challenging, that just kind of move off a dog with no hesitation, are usually glued to the handler's legs, or know the course and routine so well they do it themselves, and then people think their talentless dog has accomplished something. Sheep get accustomed to being worked and their fight or flight instinct is severely diminished so you're not proving your dog by working stock that are dead broke.",

Border Collies, Kelpies, and Aussies are all known as 'gathering' dogs, which are breeds who go out, gather stock, bring them back, or move them from point A to point B, influencing the direction of the stock. Then you'll also have 'droving' dogs like heelers, Rottweilers, and Bouviers to name a few whose job it is to get behind stock and push, not really controlling the actual direction, they just want them to keep moving. Last you'll have 'tending' breeds like German Shepherds, Belgian Tervuren, etc. who act as a living fence- they don't necessarily *move* stock around but they travel the perimeter of the herd to keep them grouped in a certain area. There are also mustering dogs which I don't know a lot about, my understanding is that they go out, find stock, and mob them together until the handler arrives to move them.",

Used to be working dogs in cattleyards and ended up in Tasmania, where they were used as working dogs for a long time until they got bred out. Theres actually a smithfield festival wherre any dog deemed a \"Smithy\" can compete. Basically it was a more rangy English sheepdog and got interbred with various other working dogs like collies and kelpies/coolies. The working drive ones still have the eye. Or at least mine does. He's definitely not a working dog but the one time he got into a paddock with a mob of cattle he did the Collie eye and got low then chased them across the paddock keeping them grouped up. He then shit himself when they turned on him and ran the whole way back, but its interesting that the prey drive/herding genetics were there in part.",

You certainly can keep sheep without a dog but they make it so much easier. Keeping sheep without a dog requires different types of facilities, more equipment, and more manpower. As far as other things to herd with- you can't manufacture a dog's intuition and ability to think. Sheep are much more clever than people give them credit for.\n\nI was told this once- if sheep are so stupid, why does it take the world's most intelligent dog to work them?",

If I needed one, I would absolutely get one. But I have worked sheep at many farms that have LGDs- it's rare but an LGD attacking or even killing a stock dog *does* happen. Most, however, know what dogs are there to move and help their stock and which canids are there to cause harm. And generally if the shepherd is out there they know what's going on. That is of course if they are raised accustomed to stock dogs.\n\n&gt;What other breeds have you trained?\n\nMy personal training experience is limited to Border Collies but I got my start with an all-breed trainer, so I have had a lot of exposure to other herding breeds. IMO none except Australian Kelpies hold a candle to a working Border Collie.\n\n&gt; Have you ever herded anything other than sheep?\n\nI have worked goats, chickens, and ducks with my dogs, and I have trained several dogs who have gone home to work cattle. I don't work cattle with my own dogs as I don't have a need to, I don't own any cattle myself. I have been thinking about starting to work cattle though since there are a lot of cattledog trials in Iowa and not many sheepdog trials here.",

I grew up on a sheep farm and the collies the farmer had were unstoppable balls of energy and cleverness, and while I know pet BCs are also very intense and need lots of mental stimulation, I've never seen a pet that could match a working collie's energy and stamina. I was told this was specifically to do with separate breed \"stock\" but I've wondered if that's true or if it's purely that working collies will, by definition, do more work and have a level of fitness accordingly?",

Most of the lines will still be high energy dogs but the farther away you get from dogs that have been extensively worked and bred for their working ability, the more neuroses and less ability you find. There are a lot of people who think that any dog of any specific breed still qualifies as that breed and therefore capable of doing the work- which couldn't be further from the truth. It's easy to lose working ability in these dogs so yes there is a massive difference in ability from working bred to pet bred.",

You might luck out occasionally but generally it's going to be 100x harder, take more time and effort with less satisfactory results than it will be to start with a talented, purpose-bred dog. You're absolutely right with your sentiments about responsible, purpose breeding.

I was at an arena trial once, somehow she got the sheep backed into a corner and neither of us had the right tools yet to know how to get ourselves out of that situation. Instead of 'scooping' them out of the corner like we should have, she kept cautiously walking into them, putting more and more pressure on them when they couldn't  go anywhere. At one point the ewe put her head down and jumped at my dog- the ewe never made contact but it scared my dog. She turned around, tucked tail and ran away SCREAMING across the arena. Everyone who was there went running to the fence like \"is she okay?!\" thinking that she'd been pulverized by this ewe... and I'm left standing there in disbelief like \"the sheep didn't even touch her!\"\n\nI've come a long way since then XD",

Basically I use my body language to move the dog in a circle or flank around the sheep, once they're comfortable going both directions and are moving off of me correctly, I just start applying the word to the action. So if I move off from my sheep to the left, that should send the dog clockwise around the sheep and I simply apply the word \"come bye\" as they're going in that direction, just the opposite for \"away\". For a while I don't enforce it, just saying the words. After they're used to traveling around correctly I'll start to ask for the flank verbally without moving my body, and work to enforce it. They usually figure it out pretty quickly.\n\nMost of my corrections are verbal or physically blocking movement with my body, flag, or stock stick (like blocking movement/direction, not making actual physical contact). If the dog is not responding to verbal pressure at a distance, that tells me the dog doesn't have the skill solid at hand, so I'll bring them back up close until they're more solid, then build distance again.\n\nI never, ever use shock collars and anyone who does is a lousy trainer. Shock collars can be excellent tools for a lot of dogs and al lot of disciplines, but they should **never** be used on herding dogs. My corrections and pressure are mostly verbal- pressure on if they're incorrect, pressure off when they're right.",

Interactions between the stock and dog happen SO quickly that if you're not 100% correct in your timing, you end up correcting the dog for the wrong thing, which confuses them, hurts their confidence, and hinders training.",

And that it should never be used by people that do not have that ability. \n\nIt is, however, common here to use \"adversive\" methods such as shaking a can of gravel at a herding dog - to shock them/scare them out of a stare or whatever you dont want them doing. Would you say you find it necessary to do so, or could you do that simply by adding/removing your body/changing your body language?",

And by adversives I don't mean shock collars- I mean use of tools like flags, sticks, rattle cans like you mentioned, shouting, etc. Most of it is auditory or visual pressure but there are people who think positive only training is successful and it absolutely is not. We of course use rewards (access to stock and release of pressure) in training but not in the way the R+ community thinks. *Most* training is done with body pressure and body language but sometimes more is necessary especially if the dog is harassing the stock.",

But with such stimuli, one runs the risk of the animal making an incorrect association between a random stimuli and pain, or worse, the trainer and pain. It depresses behavior but does not teach the desired behavior nor address the underlying behavioral causes. \n\nThis is why skillful trainers take the environment into account and set up training plans with appropriate levels of escalating difficulty, solidifying skills at each level. For a lot of misbehavior, prevention is much more effective than punishment while solidifying a competing wanted behavior. This is why science-backed training focuses on positive reward, negative punishment (as in, taking a nice thing away), and management of the environment. Some cases, as mentioned here, changes in voice or body posture can be a \u201cpunishment\u201d in that it lets the dog know it picked the wrong behavior, but if you\u2019re to a point where you\u2019re shocking a dog, there\u2019s already a lot that\u2019s been done wrong.",

            "comment": "I once rented a room from a 5th generation Vermont farmer in an old farmhouse. There was a retired border collie that lived there with me. He was a good boy but pretty neglected it seemed to me. He had a giant open wound on his back he would chew :( meanwhile the newer younger dogs were all healthy and lived in the farmers house. Is this common? It felt like the farmer saw the dog more as a tool he didn't need anymore than a being in need of love. \n\nSide story about zip the dog: one absolutely freezing winter night my friend and I wake up to the sound of cars honking, phone ringing repeatedly, wondering wtf is going on. Then someone yells from the road \"your cows are out! Your cows are out!\" turns out the cows got loose and were all over the place including the \"highway\" (vt single lane). I felt like I had to save the day so I put gear on and run outside. I have 0 farm experience and have barely seen a cow before this so kind of dumb. As soon as I got out there I was pretty afraid. But zip was with me. His eyes were wide seeing this mayhem and he looked at me, I just said \"yes bro go get em\" lol and he rounded up all these cows so fast, it blew my mind. It's one thing to see a YouTube video but seeing it in real life, this old beat up dog rounding up these huge animals in the dark with so much confidence and joy, was awe inspiring. Eventually the farmer came (his house was miles away) and fixed the fence etc but that's my cool story about Zip. \n\nBonus question - what do you think is the best resource for people training their pets of any breed? I wish more people would take the time. Do you think sending a dog to a training school can be effective, or waste of money?",

Find a trainer you like and agree with, and stick to that. The reason I say stick to that one trainer, is because you can easily get overwhelmed with too much variable information and then it just causes confusion in the long run. YouTube has a lot of trainers with free content for basic stuff. You can search for Michael Ellis (Leerburg) for example, however lost of his free content is very short form and you benefit more by paying for the online courses. Fenrir Canine also has a nice channel with lots of free content. Then if you can afford it you can go for their paid content. Personally I have a Nino Drowerts course from STSK9, but he doesn't have free content. However I love his methods, and I'm very happy with the course. One of his former students had a YouTube channel called \"Modern Malinois\" which is where I learned of Nino and decided that this was the course for me. \n\nIf you have other questions I'm happy to help. Oh, as for sending the dog to board and train, I think that's a bit of a lazy option. Sure, your dog will learn stuff, but they'll have learned those things in a different environment than your own home which means they'll have to relearn a bit to adapt into your own home. Also they'll have gotten used to obeying a skilled trainer, not an amateur such as yourself. So personally I think learning to train your dog yourself (and maybe finding a dog training coach to help you with that process) is the most effective.",

I have an almost 5-year old heeler and he is bonkers smart and an asshole, which is a common trait as far as I understand and makes them ideal for herding cattle because they are tough and stubborn and can be aggressive when needed. My impression has always been that border collies will try to anticipate their handler\u2019s commands and are eager to please, while heelers mainly anticipate the handler\u2019s commands in order to try to outsmart them and get what they want. Do you see heelers successfully herding anything other than cattle commonly, or are BCs pretty much universally the choice for non-cattle driving?",

It may start that way but it's rare for most pet quality dogs to be able to get past that state of chase/arousal and turn into a useful dog- there's so much more that goes into working ability than just the drive to respond to movement.",

I got my start around a lot of Tervs, I know there can be some nervy ones out there.\n\nI'm hesitant to give advice on pet dog training issues as that's not in my wheelhouse, would recommend r/dogs for potentially more appropriate advice",

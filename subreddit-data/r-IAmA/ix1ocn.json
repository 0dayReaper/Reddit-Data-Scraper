[www.dandi.io](https://dandi.io/)\n\nConfronted by the enormous challenges we face both locally and globally, it\u2019s easy to feel powerless and overwhelmed. \n\nFor the past 4 years, I have been lucky to work for the UNDP as a goodwill ambassador and have seen not only the real challenges we face but also been blessed to meet dedicated people from all over the world desperately wanting to make the world a better place. \n\nUnfortunately, charities have to spend way too much time fundraising, branding and networking\u2013 and less time doing the important work. I have had countless discussions trying to find a way to better this system. \n\nBy using technology there is a way. We need to insist on working together across nonprofits to make sure we achieve the goals we all share, as quickly and efficiently as possible. That resources go to the groups that can solve whatever a specific challenge calls for, as soon as the need is there. Dandi is a tool that can enable us to do just that. \n\nUsing and combining huge amounts of data from nonprofits on the ground, we will be able to direct funds to where they will have the most positive impact\u2013 faster and more efficiently than ever before.\n\n I urge you to check out Dandi and join this new movement of collaborative humanitarian action. \n\nThank you, \n\nNikolaj\n\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/u50pb1bu08o51.jpg",

Nicolaj is\u2026 let\u2019s face it for all his fine credits in Denmark, known as an incestuous knight with daddy issues. Viggo we can get a pass, but he is also only half Danish.\n\nAh and Mads\u2019 lesser known brother Lars, who is a better actor if you ask me, is mostly known internationally for essentially playing Putin on House of Cards and the last villain on Sherlock before it went to shit.\n\nDanish actors, if you need someone to fill the most messed up character your writers can come up with, look no further.",

We are committed to fast, transparent delivery of funds. \n\nGauging impact is a complicated endeavor, that can be analyzed differently across different issues area/ and geographies. Long story short: It\u2019s all about going local.  \n\nAt Dandi, we work a network of small-but-mighty LOCAL nonprofits. they know best what their communities need. \n\nOur goal is to accomplish both crisis-response, and address systemic-level change.",

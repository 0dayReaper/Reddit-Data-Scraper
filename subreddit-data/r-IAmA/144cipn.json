There is A LOT of hidden wealth that outside observers can't confirm. Sure, oil oligarchs are one area. There is, however, a significant amount of wealth that simply pre-dates many of the governments tasked with regulating it. Think old, old money. I believe there's a family, still worth billions, whose money originally came from managing the mail system of the Holy Roman Empire. Its pretty difficult to account for wealth that pre-dates modern capitalism.",

The family, originally named \"Tasso\" from Lombardy, held the hereditary office of Postmaster General of the Holy Roman Empire, starting from the 16th century. They were heavily involved in the development of the European postal system, which greatly contributed to their significant wealth. They remain a prominent family today, with a substantial fortune derived from diverse investments and holdings.\n\nThough their wealth [has been estimated](https://www.castleholic.com/2017/03/castletalk-curious-case-of-thurn-und.html?m=1) at around $2.5B as of 2017, I'd imagine it must have grown substantially since then.",

It's how human civilization worked until just a few decades ago.\n\nThere's a reason e.g. the ATF is still working on paper records. The gun nuts have gone to great lobbying lengths to make it an onerous effort for the government to be unable to create a digital list of gun owners to seize their guns easily - would the government want to ban and seize, say, all registered AR-15s, it would take *many* man-years of effort to sift through the paper records instead of putting a nerd in front of a psql CLI and have the list ready in under ten minutes (including the time needed to write the query).\n\n&gt; And while land ownership can be somewhat murky, it's not nearly murky enough to hide secret billionaires.\n\nOh hell yes it is, ever heard of offshore shell companies? It's a giant PITA especially here in Europe right now, because if the only thing the government knows is a Belize LLC on the deed register, the government has to great lengths (and the Belize authorities have to cooperate as well) to prove that a property belongs to a sanctioned Ruzzian oligarch.\n\n&gt; Governments do not, for the most part, rely on honest self-reporting, and someone dishonestly not reporting billions of dollars of real estate would be found out in short order.\n\nOh they do. The IRS for example doesn't have the resources to do regular in-depth audits for the uber-rich, and the few cases where they *do* audit a billionaire they *always* find \"tax optimization\" that goes into illegal territory. Which is, again, why there was so much lobbying effort to get the IRS enforcement gutted, most recently in the debt ceiling \"deal\".",

When your project is pure data analysis, but Excel or Tableau are a bit weak for your needs, that's when I'd recommend R.\n\nI'd recommend Python more when the data analysis component of your project touches some more general programming tasks where there are more mature libraries, such as in AI modeling.\n\nOther folks will probably have different opinions on that.",

For example, a few years ago we saw a big dip in figures due to the pandemic and the next year we saw a tremendous rebound by companies.  \n\nAlso, we are able to see trends in industries.  For example, Health Care companies accounted for 8 of the top 25 this year.  In 1995, there were no Health Care companies in the top 25.\n\n\\- Scott",

Basically, over time, we have improved the efficiency of automation and mechanization. These are expensive but make workers far more productive on a per-capita basis.\n\nAs a result, over time, you see companies tend to get bigger and better because they are becoming more automated and spending more money on the capital goods that promote higher productivity.\n\nMoreover, revenues aren't profits. Almost all money corporations make goes to their employees.

I just got back from reporting from the El-Paso-Juarez border.\n\nWhile there, I spoke to border officials, a young migrant family from Venezuela and staffers for non-\nprofits focused on caring for migrants and asylum seekers in the El Paso area.\n\nI decided to go to the border last week to cover the end of Title 42. For more than 3 years, this policy has cited COVID concerns to allow border officials to quickly turn back migrants who illegally cross the border \u2014 blocking them from even applying for asylum.\n\nGovernment officials have been concerned that the end of the policy would trigger a massive surge in the number of people coming across the border \u2014 on top of the already historically high numbers we\u2019ve seen recently.\n\nDaily border crossing reached record highs leading up to the end of the policy. But in the days afterward, the numbers have declined \u2014 likely in response to new, restrictive policies put in place by Biden.\n\nI\u2019m ready to answer your questions about Biden border policies, Title 42, the numbers and demographics of migrants and asylum seekers, recent legislation proposed by Congress and other immigration topics.\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://postimg.cc/njKpz4wM)!",

Thank you for your question\n\nI tend to be skeptical about immigration reform being passed with the GOP in control of the House and Democrats in control of the Senate, given it is such a deeply partisan issue. However, the end of Title 42 has instigated a few, narrow bipartisan efforts as [I've reported on a little bit recently](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/07/house-vote-gop-migration-plan-border-restrictions-end). I'll be watching those.\n\nThe new rule implemented last week makes it much more difficult for many migrants to pursue asylum. It automatically rejects migrants from asylum if they cross into the U.S. without authorization and have not first applied for protection in a country they travelled through, such as Mexico. So yes, the standard and criteria are more difficult for many now\n\nThis is a big change. Historically, the U.S. has protected the right to seek asylum regardless of whether migrants cross the border illegally or at legal entry points.",

In 2021, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized over 110,000 pounds of cocaine, over 200,000 pounds of methamphetamine, and over 100,000 pounds of heroin. These drugs are worth billions of dollars and have a devastating impact on the American people.\r  \n\r  \nDrug trafficking is a major source of violence in Mexico and Central America. The drug cartels that control the trade are responsible for thousands of murders each year. They also use violence to intimidate and control the people who live in the areas where they operate.\r  \n\r  \nDrug trafficking also has a negative impact on the American economy. The cost of law enforcement, healthcare, and lost productivity due to drug addiction is estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars each year.\r  \n\r  \nFor all of these reasons, it is clear that the Southern Border needs to be stronger. The U.S. government needs to invest in more border security measures, such as increased border patrol staffing, better technology, and more physical barriers. The government also needs to work with Mexico and Central American countries to address the root causes of drug trafficking, such as poverty and corruption.\r  \n\r  \nStronger border security is essential to protecting the American people from the dangers of drug trafficking. It is also essential to protecting the American economy and national security.",

Traffickers take advantage of the large flows of goods passing through the border, knowing that some portion will inevitably be found, or pay bribes to U.S. agents at the ports to look the other way. Border Patrol agents are responsible for the areas between the ports. For obvious practical reasons relatively little of the drug smuggling occurs between the ports. Migrants do of course sometimes carry small amounts of drugs. But it makes little sense to rely on them to ship quantities since the vast majority of people who cross between the ports ar\u00e9 either stopped and detained, voluntarily surrender so the Can make a legal claim to asylum or they die out in the desert. The border is under more control now than at any time in history as a result of enforcement and security that began under President Clinton.

We saw a significant uptick in the number of repeat-crossers over the past few years, attributed to the policy  \n\n\n**Now:** Many migrants who cross illegally will be assumed ineligible for asylum and then will be formally deported, which comes with a minimum 5-year ban on reentry.

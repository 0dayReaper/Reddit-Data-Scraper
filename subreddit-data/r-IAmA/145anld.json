    "postText": "I'm Chris Groshong, President of CoinStructive Inc. \n\nWhile CoinStructve handles compliance matters related to operating a crypto  business, I have a passion for using my expertise to help victims of crypto fraud. \n\nMany people who get scammed can feel helpless once they realize their money is gone. Often times, there is a gap in knowledge and forensic tools on the side of Law Enforcement that leads to stalled investigations. This is where I bridge the gap and assist by tracking and tracing stolen crypto.\n\nWhile the way these scams manifest can vary, the top scams we run across tend to fall into these main methods.\n\n-Bitcoin Investment Scams\n-Rug Pull Scams\n-Romance Scams\n-Phishing Attacks\n-Man in the Middle Attack\n-Crypto Recovery Scams\n-Social Media Giveaway Scams\n-Fake Exchanges\n-Employment Scams\n-Sim Swap Attacks\n\n\nI would love to answer questions you may have. Whether you've been part of a scam, suspect you might be, or just want to know best practices in keeping your crypto safe, I would love to help.\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/gallery/GvSBvef)!\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nThe AMA will conclude at 4pm PT/7pm ET. \n\nI've loved being here and look forward to doing another AMA in the future. Thanks to the community and mods.",

It's the first time in the history of humankind that two parties have been able to universally transact without the need of a third party.

Because of this, basically since its inception, third parties have inserted themselves to make things easier for the end user. At this point, basically 100% of people who deal with crypto do so through a third party, often a VC-funded startup with much less regulatory oversight than the established monolithic financial industry.\n\nAs well, even the nature of crypto itself \u2014 every transaction being a permanent addition to a ledger \u2014 I'd argue is *less* secure than traditional assets. You can be sure that your funds are in the hands of the receiving address, but that's not inherently secure. In fact, it means fraud, hacks, and simple mistakes are set in stone and can only be undone through access to the receiving wallet, if it even exists.\n\nThis is not even to mention that, because crypto's value is entirely beholden to speculation, it is simply too volatile to be used as a currency in everyday life, and even at its most stable is still vulnerable to mismanagement by those same third parties that allow the general populace to participate.\n\nThe financial system we have is certainly not perfect, there's no doubt about that. But the crypto space has essentially just recreated the traditional financial system we already have, just with extra steps and fewer protections for the end users. All this, supported by a small country's worth of power fueling purposely wasteful brute forcing of random math problems in order to ensure that the money it made up isn't spent twice. Is it worth it to be using the most powerful single computer network to prop this up? I'd say no, it very much isn't.",

It's not guaranteed that anyone will ever get a recovery of assets that they've had stolen or that they've had hacked or given away to scammers. There are, however, opportunities to track and trace assets to places where they can be recovered with the help of law enforcement.  \n**I mean if the crypto scammers got the money in China/India/North Korea, even with the exact address of the scammers, your local police department can't really do anything about it.**  \nJust because local police doesn't have the ability to go overseas doesn't mean they can't help.  many times local law enforcement helps put together enough information that makes it easier for federal law enforcement to pick up the case.  many of these foreign actors are part of organized crime and there are many many victims involved.  eventually these types of situations are going to lead to a criminal Enterprise which is being investigated by federal agencies.   so a recovery may not occur right away but should a bust happen several years down the road and  your case is part of the bigger investigation you should receive restitution  \n**And in most places they don't even bother, unless they got some new guy who's hopes and dreams were not crushed yet and wants to impress the boss. But either way, no way to get your money back.**  \nI understand your frustration  and it sounds like you've worked with local law enforcement in the past.  yes it does seem to be that the Old Guard is less likely to help than a fresh new recruit however we're seeing more and more local law enforcement learning about how to proceed with these cases.  In fact I had a officer from Quakertown Pennsylvania subpoena Binance and receive a successful response.  \n**Or is there?**  \n so to clarify there are two ways to get your money back one is initially through asset seizure at an exchange or a subpinoble entity or somewhere down the road,  could be 2 years or more,  you could receive restitution from the bust of a big investigation",

They even have templates on what questions to ask on a subpoena to a bank, but they don't know what kind of questions to ask the Crypto Exchange.\r  \n\r  \nThe biggest problem we see between victims and the local police is the terminology and the language used in describing the situation. Most victims and law enforcement end up talking past each other because they don't understand exactly 100% what they're talking about. This is no fault of anyone's, this is just the result of a new industry. \r  \n\r  \nWhen we work with victims directly, we always schedule time to talk to the local police department on their behalf to explain the investigative report that we're delivering to them. That really helps them understand where we're coming from, where the victim is coming from, and how to proceed. For you, the best thing would be to compile all the information you have in a clear and followable path so that you can \"tell the story\", so the speak.",

The attacks never really seem to stop. We even get scammers showing up to our intake calls pretending to be victims themselves sometimes.  \r  \nI've even had friends and family members targeted.

Like if someone occasionally buys small amounts what is the likelihood of them being pursued by law enforcement?

Perhaps they have some of the buyer's personal data like home address or IP address. Perhaps they share that information with law enforcement as part of a plea deal. \r  \nIt\u2019s more likely that a user of the dark web marketplaces could be wrapped up in an investigation that wasn\u2019t initially intended for them, but may lead to them being a suspect. \r  \nI actually know someone that went to jail this way. So be careful, it\u2019s usually the unforeseeable consequences that get us in the most trouble.",

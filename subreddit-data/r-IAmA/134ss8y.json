    "postText": "Hey, I\u2019m Josh. I co-founded StockX and Fanatics Collectibles. Before StockX was StockX, it was Campless, a side project which we called a \u201csneakerhead data\u201d company - i.e., a price guide for sneakers. StockX was the natural evolution of Campless: building a marketplace based on stock market principles on top of our robust sneaker data layer. Of course, it\u2019s much sexier to say we built a multi-billion dollar eBay killer with Drake and Eminem. After StockX I co-founded Fanatics Collectibles with Michael Rubin. That was bigger, faster, crazier and completely changed the trading card industry forever. You can read about it. Speaking of trading cards, I kinda wrote the book on it\u2026well, the whitepaper was so long it felt like a book. You can read that too: [here](https://www.tradingcardsarecoolagain.com/). I also founded zerocool, Servinity, Tech Experts, ShopTurntable and a chewing gum resale business out of my locker in 6th grade. I collect sneakers, trading cards, toys, hats, hoodies, and startup founders. \n\nAsk me about the past, present, or future of collectibles, startups or anything else!\n\nPhoto: https://twitter.com/joshluber/status/1653075186827010049\n\nTwitter: [@joshluber](https://twitter.com/joshluber)\nInstagram: [@joshluber](https://www.instagram.com/joshluber/)\nLinkedIn: [Josh Luber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshluber/)\n\nAlso I talk about this stuff more in-depth on the [For the (sub)Culture podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5OhzWOtR7cjwFP2vHRmQas), if you\u2019re interested in hearing more.",

Remember, this is the NBA, the NFL and MLB...and there are actually so few sports fans who collect cards (compared to the total number of sports fans).

These are products that have finite supply, products that are supply and demand constrained and have a market price. These are products that are often sold using 'drops'. These are products that you might ask: \"How much is this worth?\"  These are the products I am interested in, both as a collector and an entrepreneur, and that's a long way of introducing the idea that the 'next big thing' has to, at a basic level, has to come from this space. It has to be a product that has finite supply and touched the intersection of culture and commerce such that when demand spikes just a little too much - often at the hands of an important person in culture - everyone wants to get one and prices soar.  If you combine that with what we saw as a core pillar of sneaker and trading card growth - the demographic shift of my generation (I'm 45 years old) getting to a point in our careers where we have a little bit more disposal income but we are still young enough to want those cultural artifacts from our youth, then one of the really interesting spaces to watch is collectible toys.  I actually read an article a few months ago about how adults are buying more and more toys for themselves, and I think that makes sense. Personally I've been buying a lot of GI Joe vehicles from the late 80's over the past few months. I'm not suggesting GI Joe becomes the next Yeezy, but I do think collectible toys are an area to watch\"",

I don't see numbers or discuss strategy or have anything to do with it anymore (despite people still DM'ing me customer service issues on IG lol). That said, trading cards don't fit the StockX model as cleanly as sneakers do - at least not singles. Wax is closer to sneakers in that you need a lot of liquidity of a single sku that can be sold off one single product page using a stock photo. That's what enables the Bid/Ask model; that's what creates the efficiency.  Trading card singles just don't have a lot of liquidity - even graded cards only have, at the peak, a few dozen of each grade. Compare that to a new Jordan release which has thousands, maybe ten of thousands of each size.\"",

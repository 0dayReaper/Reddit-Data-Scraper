None of them claim to have any actual proof, they're just so damned sure I'm a russian spy that it must be true.\n\nAnd I get that. I really do. I mean come on - I used to teach \"cyber counterintelligence\" (their term) at DIA.\n\nBut when you look at in aggregate, what sense does that make? If I were a russian spy, why go to Hong Kong? It's would have been an unacceptable risk. And further - why give any information to journalists at all, for that matter, much less so much and of such importance? Any intelligence value it would have to the russians would be immediately compromised.\n\nIf I were a spy for the russians, why the hell was I trapped in any airport for a month? I would have gotten a parade and a medal instead.\n\nThe reality is I spent so long in that damn airport because I wouldn't play ball and nobody knew what to do with me. I refused to cooperate with Russian intelligence in any way (see my testimony to EU Parliament on this one if you're interested), and that hasn't changed.\n\nAt this point, I think the reason I get away with it is because of my public profile. What can they really do to me? If I show up with broken fingers, everybody will know what happened. ",

Unfortunately, it does not apply to the intelligence community. More unfortunately, the protections conferred by the act are determined in a case by case basis by the [United States Merit Systems Protection Board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Merit_Systems_Protection_Board) which pretty much always sides with the Government and not with the whistleblower. \n\nThe sad part is that because laws exist with names which sound like they should be doing what we expect, it is hard to get people excited about amending these laws to do what they should.

This is something we see in almost every sector of government, not just in the national security space, but it's very important:\n\nOnce you grant the government some new power or authority, it becomes exponentially more difficult to roll it back. Regardless of how little value a program or power has been shown to have (such as the Section 215 dragnet interception of call records in the United States, which the government's own investigation found never stopped a single imminent terrorist attack despite a decade of operation), once it's a sunk cost, once dollars and reputations have been invested in it, it's hard to peel that back.\n\nDon't let it happen in your country.\n\n\n",

It's these tax cuts that have contributed to growing inequality.  Why is Trudeau promising outright to keep these tax cuts but making only vague references to inequality?\n\n- [He's opposed to legalized and regulated prostitution.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-wary-of-proposal-to-regulate-tax-prostitution-1.2500357)  He's called it \"a form of violence against women\" and was quite enthusiastic about the Nordic model, which penalizes buying and legalizes selling, just like Harper supports.

His policies are continuations of Chretien/Martin policies which themselves are continuations of Mulroney policies and Trudeau is supporting all the same ones.  Trudeau will keep us moving in the same direction as every other PM of the last 30 years.\n\nIsn't it time for an actual change, not the same old change we're promised by both the CPC and Liberals that never seems to come?",

When the leadership of both parties join together - as they so often do, despite the myths to the contrary - those issues disappear from mainstream public debate.\n\nThe most interesting political fact about the NSA controversy, to me, was how the divisions didn't break down at all on partisan lines. Huge amount of the support for our reporting came from the left, but a huge amount came from the right. When the first bill to ban the NSA domestic metadata program was introduced, it was tellingly sponsored by one of the most conservative Tea Party members (Justin Amash) and one of the most liberal (John Conyers).\n\nThe problem is that the leadership of both parties, as usual, are in full agreement: they love NSA mass surveillance. So that has blocked it from receiving more debate. That NSA program was ultimately saved by the unholy trinity of Obama, Nancy Pelosi and John Bohener, who worked together to defeat the Amash/Conyers bill.\n\nThe division over this issue (like so many other big ones, such as crony capitalism that owns the country) is much more \"insider v. outsider\" than \"Dem v. GOP\". But until there are leaders of one of the two parties willing to dissent on this issue, it will be hard to make it a big political issue.\n\nThat's why the Dem efforts to hand Hillary Clinton the nomination without contest are so depressing. She's the ultimate guardian of bipartisan status quo corruption, and no debate will happen if she's the nominee against some standard Romney/Bush-type GOP candidate. Some genuine dissenting force is crucial.",

Activism is important. \n\nAt the same time, we should remember that governments don't often reform themselves. One of the arguments in a book I read recently (Bruce Schneier, \"Data and Goliath\"), is that perfect enforcement of the law sounds like a good thing, but that may not always be the case. The end of crime sounds pretty compelling, right, so how can that be?\n\nWell, when we look back on history, the progress of Western civilization and human rights is actually founded on the violation of law.  America was of course born out of a violent revolution that was an outrageous treason against the crown and established order of the day. History shows that the righting of historical wrongs is often born from acts of unrepentant criminality. Slavery. The protection of persecuted Jews. \n\nBut even on less extremist topics, we can find similar examples. How about the prohibition of alcohol? Gay marriage? Marijuana? \n\nWhere would we be today if the government, enjoying powers of perfect surveillance and enforcement, had -- entirely within the law -- rounded up, imprisoned, and shamed all of these lawbreakers?\n\nUltimately, if people lose their willingness to recognize that there are times in our history when legality becomes distinct from morality, we aren't just ceding control of our rights to government, but our agency in determing thour futures.\n\nHow does this relate to politics? Well, I suspect that governments today are more concerned with the loss of their ability to control and regulate the behavior of their citizens than they are with their citizens' discontent. \n\nHow do we make that work for us? We can devise means, through the application and sophistication of science, to remind governments that if they will not be responsible stewards of our rights, we the people will implement systems that provide for a means of not just enforcing our rights, but *removing from governments the ability to interfere with those rights*.\n\nYou can see the beginnings of this dynamic today in the statements of government officials complaining about the adoption of encryption by major technology providers. The idea here isn't to fling ourselves into anarchy and do away with government, but to remind the government that there must always be a balance of power between the governing and the governed, and that as the progress of science increasingly empowers communities and individuals, there will be more and more areas of our lives where -- if government insists on behaving poorly and with a callous disregard for the citizen -- we can find ways to reduce or remove their powers on a new -- and permanent -- basis. \n\nOur rights are not granted by governments. They are inherent to our nature. But it's entirely the opposite for governments: their privileges are precisely equal to only those which we suffer them to enjoy.\n\nWe haven't had to think about that much in the last few decades because quality of life has been increasing across almost all measures in a significant way, and that has led to a comfortable complacency. But here and there throughout history, we'll occasionally come across these periods where governments think more about what they \"can\" do rather than what they \"should\" do, and what is lawful will become increasingly distinct from what is moral. \n\nIn such times, we'd do well to remember that at the end of the day, the law doesn't defend us; we defend the law. And when it becomes contrary to our morals, we have both the right and the responsibility to rebalance it toward just ends.",

I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that \"an unjust law is no law at all.\" \n",

I was going to tweet something about it and decided it was too petty and inconsequential even to tweet about - just some lame word-play Oscar joke from a guy who had just been running around onstage in his underwear moments before. So I forgot about it. My reaction was similar to Ed's, though I did think the joke was lame.\n\nA couple hours later at a post-Oscar event, a BuzzFeed reporter saw me and asked me a bunch of questions about the film and the NSA reporting, one of which was about that \"treason\" joke. I laughed, said it was just a petty pun and I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but then said I thought it was stupid and irresponsible to stand in front of a billion people and accuse someone of \"treason\" who hasn't even been charged with it, let alone convicted of it.\n\nKnowing that would be the click-worthy comment, BuzzFeed highlighted that in a headline, making it seem like I had been on the warpath, enraged about this, convening a press conference to denounce this outrage. In fact, I was laughing about it the whole time when I said it, as the reporter noted. But all that gets washed away, and now I'm going to hear comments all day about how I'm a humorless scold who can't take a good joke, who gets furious about everything, etc. etc.\n\nNobody did anything wrong here, including BuzzFeed. But it's just a small anecdote illustrating how the imperatives of internet age media and need-for-click headlines can distort pretty much everything they touch.",

They assert (frequently without evidence) what is true or false about cases and controversies in the public news that might influence the thinking about the Intelligence Community workforce, while at the same time reminding them how *totally screwed* they'll be if they talk to a journalist (while helpfully reminding them to refer people to the public affairs office).\n\nThink about what it does to a person to come into their special top-secret office every day and get a special secret email from \"The Director of NSA\" (actually drafted by totally different people, of course, because senior officials don't have time to write PR emails) explaining to you why everything you heard in the news is wrong, and how only the brave, patriotic, and hard-working team of cleared professionals in the IC know the truth.\n\nThink about how badly you want to believe that. Everybody wants to be valued and special, and nobody wants to think they've perhaps contributed to a huge mistake. It's not evil, it's human.\n\nTell your friend I was just like they are. But there's a reason the government has -- now almost two years out -- never shown me to have told a lie. I don't ask anybody to believe me. I don't *want* anybody to believe me.

Well, although firmware exploitation is nasty, it's at least theoretically reparable: tools could plausibly be created to detect the bad firmware hashes and re-flash good ones. This isn't the same for SIMs, which are flashed at the factory and never touched again. [When the NSA and GCHQ compromised the security of potentially billions of phones (3g/4g encryption relies on the shared secret resident on the sim)](https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/02/19/great-sim-heist/), they not only screwed the manufacturer, they screwed all of us, because the only way to address the security compromise is to recall and replace every SIM sold by Gemalto.\n\nOur governments - particular the security branches - should never be weighing the equities in an intelligence gathering operation such that a temporary benefit to surveillance regarding a few key targets is seen as more desireable than protecting the communications of a global system (and this goes double when we are more reliant on communications and technology for our economy productivity than our adversaries).",

The problem is we feel disempowered. We feel like we can't do anything about it, so we may as well not try.\n\nIt's going to be a long process, but that's starting to change. The technical community (and a special shoutout to every underpaid and overworked student out there working on this -- you are the noble Atlas lifting up the globe in our wildly inequitable current system) is in a lot of way left holding the bag on this one by virtue of the nature of the problems, but that's not all bad. 2013, for a lot of engineers and researchers, was a kind of atomic moment for computer science. Much like physics post-Manhattan project, an entire field of research that was broadly apolitical realized that work intended to improve the human condition could also be subverted to degrade it.\n\nPoliticians and the powerful have indeed got a hell of a head start on us, but equality of awareness is a powerful equalizer. In almost every jurisdiction you see officials scrambling to grab for new surveillance powers now not because they think they're necessary -- even government reports say mass surveillance doesn't work -- but because they think it's their last chance.\n\nMaybe I'm an idealist, but I think they're right. In twenty years' time, the paradigm of digital communications will have changed entirely, and so too with the norms of mass surveillance.\n",

The courts would not allow it. So he'd be barred from raising the defense they keep saying he should come back and raise.\n\nThe goal of the US government is to threaten, bully and intimidate all whistleblowers - which is what explains the mistreatment and oppression of the heroic Chelsea Manning - because they think that climate of fear is crucial to deterring future whistleblowers.\n\nAs long as they embrace that tactic, it's hard to envision them letting Ed return to his country. But we as citizens should be much more interested in the question of why our government threatens and imprisons whistleblowers.",

So he'd be barred from raising the defense they keep saying he should come back and raise.\n\nI'd like to add some words about that wonderful bill:\n\n*The Espionage Act of 1917 was passed to prevent spying but also contained a section which criminalized inciting or attempting to incite any mutiny, desertion, or refusal of duty in the armed forces, punishable with a fine of not more than $10,000, not more than twenty years in federal prison, or both. Thousands of anti-war activists and unhappy citizens were prosecuted on authority of this and the Sedition Act of 1918, which tightened restrictions even more. Among the most famous was Eugene Debs, chairman of the Socialist Party of the USA for giving an anti-war speech in Ohio. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld these prosecutions in a series of decisions. Conscientious objectors were punished as well, most of them Christian pacifist inductees. They were placed directly in the armed forces and court-martialed, receiving draconian sentences and harsh treatment. A number of them died in Alcatraz Prison, then a military facility. Vigilante groups were formed which suppressed dissent as well, such as by rounding up draft-age men and checking if they were in possession of draft cards or not.*",

The US Government hasn't restricted its own power, but it's unrealistic to expect them to do so.\n\nThere are now court cases possible challenging the legality of this surveillance - one federal court in the US and a British court just recently found this spying illegal.\n\nSocial media companies like Facebook and Apple are being forced by their users to install encryption and other technological means to prevent surveillance, which is a significant barrier.\n\nNations around the world (such as Brazil and Germany) are working together in unison to prevent US hegemony over the internet and to protect the privacy of their own citizens.\n\nAnd, most of all, because people now realize the extent to which their privacy is being compromised, they can - and increasingly are - using encryption and anonymizers to protect their own privacy and physically prevent mass surveillance (see here: http://www.wired.com/2014/05/sandvine-report/).\n\nAll of these changes are very significant. And that's to say nothing of the change in consciousness around the world about how hundreds of millions of people think about these issues. The story has been, and continues to be, huge in many countries outside the US.",

Google encrypted the backhaul communications between their data centers to prevent passive monitoring. Apple was the first forward with an FDE-by-default smartphone (kudos!). Grad students around the world are trying to come up with ways to solve the metadata problem (the opportunity to monitor everyone's associations -- who you talk to, who you sleep with, who you vote for -- even in encrypted communications).\n\nThe biggest change has been in awareness. Before 2013, if you said the NSA was making records of everybody's phonecalls and the GCHQ was monitoring lawyers and journalists, people raised eyebrows and called you a conspiracy theorist. \n\nThose days are over. Facts allow us to stop speculating and start building, and that's the foundation we need to fix the internet. We just happened to be the generation stuck with fighting these fires.",

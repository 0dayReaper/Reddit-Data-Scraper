    "postText": "I've written a long investigation into Russian oligarchs for the magazine before, but my interest in this particular subject was first piqued several years ago during the Brexit process when I learned that Spanish and Portuguese authorities were offering citizenship to individuals who could prove their descent from Jews who had been expelled from both countries starting in the late 15th Century (many British jews were applying so they could get an EU passport).\n\nAs a consequence of this law, the Jewish community in one Portuguese city had started to flourish in a way that was very rare outside of Israel - since so many Jewish people have been leaving other countries for Israel in recent decades. Then I saw last year that the rabbi for that Jewish community, in the city of Porto, had been arrested in relation to Roman Abramovich's citizenship application, and I decided I had to find out what had happened.  \n\n\nHere's my Twitter account: [https://twitter.com/WillemMarx](https://twitter.com/WillemMarx)\n\nHere's the story for Vanity Fair: [https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/05/roman-abramovich-eu-citizen](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/05/roman-abramovich-eu-citizen)\n\n* Ask me anything about  \n the law of reparations for Jewish people with historic links to Portugal.  \n\\- the application for citizenship made by Roman Abramovich  \n\\- the fallout for the local Jewish community  \n\n\nI'LL BE BACK TO ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS MONDAY 22nd MAY!",

The Rabbi was not the only individual who was approving certifications, as my story makes clear, and the requirements that Mr. Abramovich met, on their own, were in keeping with a methodology that the Jewish community in Porto had been following consistently for many years, without any formal complaints, nor credible evidence (or even a credible suggestion that I have seen, at least) that there was ever some sort of quid pro quo involving wealthy donors and certification. The criteria were created by the Portuguese legislature, and the Porto community was given latitute to interpret them as they saw fit, and in a way that they never sought to hide from Portugal's authorities.",

For many people who are descended from Jewish families living in Portugal at the end of the 15th century, and then in the 16th century when the Inquisiton began to operate there, it is very difficult to provide evidence of direct lineage. If you read the article, you'll see that those determining whether somebody qualified essentially took two different approaches: one was far more focused on archive and documentary evidence for that kind of lineage (which required months and sometimes years of work but was not necessarily definitive even then), one was more focused on ties to more recent Sephardic communities and Sephardic jewish identity, such as customs, language and food, alongside family names and family memories.   \n\n\nTens of thousands have successfully gone through this certification process. I have no evidence that Mr. Abramovich applied in bad faith, and there is some evidence to suggest that his family may have had Sephardic links, but scholars have different interpretations, since the documentary evidence of much of the periods and geographies in question is necessarily fragmentary, for a variety of reasons. His wealth may not have have had any impact on his Sephardic certification though, as it's not clear that the person who granted that approval so quickly (inside 2 hours) was even aware of who he actually was.",

The fallout has been substantial - many international organizations have been unwilling to work with the Porto jewish community since the start of the investigation. Many individual members of the community have been named and shamed in some quarters of the Portuguese media, with a lot of insinuation but no credible evidence of wrongdoing, often based on anonymous sources, in particular from law enforcement entities. The Sephardic nationality law was first tightened, in the aftermath of Mr. Abramovich's citizenship being made public, and legislators have recently - as you allude to - decided to try and curtail the offer of Portuguese nationality to those of Sephardic Portuguese descent at the end of this calendar year. Nobody is under any illusion that this curtailment is not directly correlated to Mr. Abramovich's citizenship and the consternation and embarrassment that has caused for the authorities in Portugal.",

It may not be right by todays standards but that was what it was at the time. The Arabs sided with Hitler. The Israelis sided with the Allies. Many of the Jewish people living in what is now Israel before the war were brought in to reclaim the land which was considered a wasteland by Arab land owners.  These Israelis bought and paid for this land. After the war the Allies partitioned the land won in the war making a Jewish homeland. They also created Jordan for whom we now call Palestinians. Don't forget that Jews in Arab lands were forced out of their ancestral homes without any compensation at all. It is a complicated history with bad and good on both sides but it seems Demonizing Jews has become fashionable once again.",

Let's also not forget the 750,000 Palestinians that were \"depopulated\" and were forced out of their homes with only what they could carry and had their homes and furniture taken by what we now call Israelis.\n\n\nSo Israel can come to the table with a real, fair peace deal any time they like. They can afford it. They are punching down. Palestine has no real way to defend itself, meaningfully fight back, or uplift and enrich itself. Israel are a UN-labelled apartheid state that has been doing everything it can to crush the people of Palestine for almost 100 years.",

I would like to be wrong about that, so please bring the counter-examples, but I don't think I am.  This makes further concessions and loosening of control politically unviable.   Israel is in a lose-lose situation.  They loosen control/make concessions, and not only are they told that their concessions are posturing, they face an increase in violent attacks against their citizens.  They react to the violence to keep their citizens safe, and they're committing genocide.",

No nation in the world will step down their security apparatus while they're actively being attacked.  The purpose of the blockade is to impede Hamas terror attacks against Israeli civilians.  Israel doesn't do it for fun.  Hamas has to stop the rocket attacks as a prerequisite for ending the blockade, but Hamas never will, because free travel and trade means the end of Hamas.  Your take on this is very na\u00efve and assumes that Palestinians have no agency at all.",

Russia today has people of many nationalities coexisting peacefully and harmoniously. We are also happy to see visitors from foreign lands and welcome them with our traditional Russian hospitality.",

Anyway, in some cases they were able to trace a family back 300 years, for instance, to a person with a last name that clearly matched that of someone known to have lived in Portugal as a jewish person in the 15th century (since written records from that period still survive in archives). Sometimes if you could show you came from a sephardic community in North Africa, the former Ottoman Empire or northern Europe (Amsterdam, London, Antwerp, New York) or you spoke a language, Ladino, that expelled jews had taken with them from the Iberian peninsula, that would be sufficient evidence to meet the criteria set by the Portuguese state.",

    "postText": "Hey hey!\n\nI\u2019m Chris, But I go by \u201cThe Architect\u201d I've done an AMA for the past 5 years and they're always a blast.\n\n[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/0KXYzZD).\n\nI have a business called [Constructed Adventures](https://www.constructedadventures.com/). I build seemingly serendipitous perfect days and wild treasure/Scavenger hunts for special occasions. I've traveled the world building Adventures for proposals, birthdays, weddings, corporate team builders, and other occasions.\n\nSome Adventures are intimate, focusing on 1 person or a small group. Others are large, with teams of people all racing to figure out where the finish line is and get there!\n\nConstructed Adventures accidentally began up when [I sent my 2015 reddit secret santa giftee on an elaborate treasure scavenger hunt date](https://imgur.com/a/khumf) for his gift and it hit the front page of Reddit. The following 6 seasons, I signed up for the Reddit Secret Santa holiday exchange (RIP) and flew out to their location to send my giftee on a a fun Adventure.\n\nMost recently, the [r/ConstructedAdventures](https://www.reddit.com/r/ConstructedAdventures/) community partnered with r/CommunityFunds to build two separate events. A digital puzzle hunt and a live 3 hour event.\n\nAsk me anything about business, event planning, or  whatever you like! Let me help you build a fun Adventure for a loved one. I can also help you avoid many of the common mistakes everyone makes.\n\nEDIT: LOTS OF QUESTIONS. I promise you Ill get to each and every one! As you can see, I'm pretty thorough with my answers so be patient if it takes me a minute!\n\nEDIT 2: In case you want to see, here are the other Secret Santa Adventures:\n\n2021 - [The Arbiter of Benevolence](https://imgur.com/a/GQhD4L8)\n\n2020 - [The Tavern Restored](https://imgur.com/gallery/Kd7D5WK)\n\n2019 - [The Queen of the Norse](https://imgur.com/a/Yxwy9pL)\n\n2018 - [The Archer Princess and the Cactus pin](https://imgur.com/gallery/xURYZWe)\n\n2017 - [The Wolf and the Owl go Bird Hunting](https://imgur.com/a/XKlNw)\n\n2016 - [The Great Sock Adventure](https://imgur.com/a/CgjD8)\n\nEDIT 3: Someone asked. I'm always looking to pay people to help.[I have a big list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8ujCtMerBXIhbwZsFEH2Mv1GJNHMvc3J2UDbOTZnMy84mVQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) that I check when I travel to an area. If you put your info in and I have an Adventure in your area, I might reach out to hire you (I won't reach out any other time)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinal Edit: thanks for the fun guys! I'll be back tomorrow to answer any questions! Feel free to chime in and I'll get to you. I appreciate you all!",

Sometimes I'm able to stay with friends or the client has hotel/flight points and that can keep costs down.\n\nOn top of that, clients give me the max budget and I just Stay under the budget and bill them the cost of whatever the Adventure is.\n\nAdventures don't necessarily have to be expensive to be fun, however, it's really nice to have a big budget to play with. It allows me to book a car/boat or even helicopter to take them around! or hire more people!\n\nHappy to expand on my answer if you like!\n\nEdit: its also worth noting that I keep it vague because I don't want to scare people away from reaching out. I have plenty of calls with potential clients where they don't have the budget or it's not a good fit. However I can still connect them with someone in the area or point them in the direction of a cheaper option! \n\nI want people to have Adventures whether I'm involved or not!",

I'm making the same thing. \n\nI really like it because it allows for an honest conversation about budget. I've worked with event planners before who say \"This will cost $10,000\" and then I ask for a breakdown of the budget and they just respond with \"$10,000\" and then I know they're just going to try to cut as many corners to pocket as much money as they can. \n\nI like being HYPER transparent and very open about everything. I have a detailed excel spreadsheet that I give to clients after the event with every cost broken down. \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",

Including businesses. \n\nLeading up to every Adventure, I'll go to the locations and speak with the manager. In terms of restaurants, I always want to make a reservation and put a credit card down to cover the cost of everything. \n\nOn top of that, I carry cash so I can tip EVERYONE! Right before the players arrive, I'll run through everything with a host/hostess, tip them $10-$20, show them a picture of the players, and duck out the back. It helps make everything go smoothly. \n\nhaving cash is nice because it allows for spur of the moment extras! One time I was doing a magical themed Adventure for a woman. In my last minute morning walkthrough, I ran into a street musican who was playing on the sidewalk in the route the players would be walking down. \n\nI tipped him $40 and asked if he could play the harry potter theme song when i passed by, he agreed. 30 minutes later, the woman gets intercepted at the farmer's market and is sent to a nearby location. I walked about 20 feet in front of her and nodded to the musician. Right when she passed him, he satrted playing the song and her reaction was priceless!",

Sometimes there's little drip feeds or teasers prior, but the meat of it is all in one day. \n\nMost days take similar prep. Similar conversations, similar scouting, etc. \n\nThere was a time when I tried to do a sliding scale based on total budget, but all it did was incentivize people pick the lowest possible budget. Then it becomes a bigger pain to put the event together because I'm on a shoestring. \n\nSince I primarily work with people who don't have experience with event planners, I like to make things as simple and clean as possible. \n\nOccasionally I'll consult on a project and in that case I just charge hourly. \n\nHope that clarifies!",

This allows you to easily take on a huge project for a company event or someone wanting a multi-day adventure without needing to work up a new structure.",

Have they done 1000 escape rooms? do they play puzzle games? Do they do the wordle and crossword puzzles? \n\nAfter that I build. Harder puzzles happen when they're stationary. Like at lunch, a bar, or in tranist (If they're not driving) \n\nEasier puzzler happen while they're on the move. Often discovery-based. \n\nFinally, PLAYTEST PLAYTEST PLAYTEST. We have a [great discord channel](https://discord.gg/2TesShmRzB) where I can toss a puzzle up and people will give their answer, time taken to solve, and how they got there. \n\nHope that helps!",

Everyone put an 8 there too. \n\nWe'd spread the 8's out on different teams and of course only one kid was an 8 and the rest could barely kick the ball and those teams would get crushed.\n\nThe survey is a great starting point but the ensuing conversation asking \"what challenge means to them\" is way more helpful. \n\nIn the end, my golden rule: It's better to make it too easy than too hard. You can come back from too easy, but if you build an Adventure for someone and its frustratingly, brutally, difficult, you run the risk of them never wanting anything like that again.",

Their brains are still hardwired to problem solve, while we just send emails. \n\nRegarding your problem, here's what I suggest: Build your first hunt using a simple mechanic. Here's two of my favorites: \n\n* Build a hunt using photos - Take pictures of locations around your home/area. Start easy, then use interesting close ups. Don't hesitate to draw on them or alter them. Then have different photos lead to others! it's simple but still really fun for anyone!\n* Misplaced things - take household items that belong in certain locations. (like a spoon or toothbrush). Put the toothbrush on the kitchen table with a little note that says \"I'm lost! Return me to my home\". When they return the toothbrush, there's a spoon in the bathroom brushcup with the same note. You can continue to make it more elaborate. \n\nOnce you've finished your first hunt, gauge how they did. If they complain that it's too easy, you can drop the hammer next time and hit them with your best shot! \n\nI'd rathe have the first hunt be too easy. If you make it too hard, you risk losing them forever!",

                    "comment": "Great question! \n\nI answered another question about budget. I have a flat rate that I charge. Right now it's $4,000 but it fluctuates based on how booked out I am. \n\nPast that, the Adventure budget varies wildly on what they player wants, where they are, ect. The smallest total budget I could probably work with is $5,000-$6,000 but Players would need to come to me. \n\nIt's interesting. You don't need a massive budget to make a fun Advdnture! You could buy a hollow book on amazon for $10 and then place it in a library with a $1.50 map  you printed at Staples and made from [snazzymaps.com](https://snazzymaps.com) and [Canva.com](https://Canva.com) and that makes for an AMAZING moment. \n\nHowever, having a bigger budget really helps. One of my favorite Adventure purchases is hiring a black car driver for the day. It's super helpful for me because I can put the GPS tracker in the trunk, I have a dedicated driver who can help with time management (\"Drive slow please\") and on they player side, they feel like royalty, they don't have to battle for parking (It came in so clutch when I did a proposal Adventure Last month in Washington D.C/Georgetown) and the players can have drinks at their leisure! However, a driver usually costs $500-$1,000! That's a lot of money! \n\nSorry for the super roundabout question. \n\nIn short, a smaller budget would involve players driving themselves, or on foot, I would love to have their friends/family involved/helping so I wouldn't have to hire helpers. Even with that, you could still do something really fun!\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or would like me to expand!",

With that said, here are some big ones: \n\n* Communication. I thought i was really good at it. I was NOT! There are so many moving pieces in these days and I have to rely on a lot of people. I have an idea of how i want something to go and it's a task to relay that idea!\n* Proper puzzle design. There's a great quote about puzzles. \"when two people play chess, they have an even playing field and either can win. But with puzzles, the designer holds all the cards, has all the advantage, but the solver should win every time.\"  I hate when escape rooms say they have a super low solve rate. To me that just screams bad puzzle design. Puzzles are meant to be solved and it took me a bit to realized I was making things too hard. \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",

I haven't done an adventure but I have done a lot of escape rooms.  fundamentally they share a lot of DNA with adventure PC games, most early escape rooms used many of the same kinds of clues, ciphers, and hints.\n\nthere's been a shift in game design in video games from trying to be hard to telling a sensible story and letting the puzzles flow from that.  some escape rooms haven't caught up.\n\nbut the moment you find yourself fiddling with soup cans just because they have letters on them, it's very clear \"oh this is a game, I'm running on game logic\" because it makes no sense otherwise.\n\nanyone can make a puzzle obscure or unfair. The real art, in my opinion, is when the puzzle is a challenge you solve with some effort and then feel both satisfaction and that in retrospect everything was obvious.",

Where. Oftentimes its a surprise party, proposal, or present. Usually it's in the evening. \n2. Work out the beginning. Usually they start at home. \n3. Figure out all the cool places in between. I like to call these \"Anchor Points.\" Think of them as the places your player absolutely HAS TO stop at (Either because it's emotionally significant or just plain awesome)\n4. Figure out how you're going to propel the player from stop to stop. Oftentimes I'll use a central mechanic with other things integrated. For example. At home the player gets a map with an X on it and directions. They arrive at a coffee shop and the barista gives them a coffee and another envelope with a vellum paper overlay. They figure out the correct way to lay the paper on the map which sends them to a park. They find a chest at the park with a UV light. They shine the light on the map and that sends them to the next stop!\n\nHope that helps! Are you hoping to build an Adventure?",

I guess that I'm a nerd for similar reasons and just absolutely love the \"how\" in the mechanics of this kind of thing. In a similar vein, I did a bit of animation and digital art creation (was never that great) but it was just gratifying to understand how some incredible animations and games are built. \n\n2. I'm a teacher and would love to consider something like this for my kids (obviously pruned WAYYYY down, though). \n\n3. I am married to a woman who would be over the moon if I ever put anything like this together for her. I don't know if I'm mechanically up to it, but I'll keep your inspiration (and your information) in mind for the future! \n\nThank you again!",

My family won it every year :) because (i) we could all at least somewhat run and (ii) three of us are puzzle/game people and (iii) we actually treated it like a race \\[which the organiser loved - she got so frustrated that the first two years there was no-one else being competitive!\\].  The prize?  Being first to eat the free cookies that everyone got :).  So we got the fun of winning and no-one else cared and all the groups that had small kids or wheelchairs or whatever still got to have fun.

Plus the people that live there are all very nice and there's some great little hidden gems. \n2. Barcelona, Spain. Massive and sprawling but with beautiful Architecture and buildings. The gothic quarter is just a place you can get lost in. The people are extremely nice and there are two speakeasies there (Dr. Stravinski and Bobby's Free) are two of the best bars in the world)\n3. New York City. There is just so much to do there! The subways also allow for cheap (somewhat) quick transportation. I always end up building an NYC Adventure in December and it's a magical time. \n\nBottom three cities: \n\n1. Houston by a wide margin. I'm not a fan of the roads or drivers. There are no zoning laws apparently, so you'll have a dennys next to an oil change station next to a doctors office next to a sexy bar next to another Dennys. Couple that with the \"It's so hot and humid I want to die\" vs \"Its so cold and the power's out so I might actually die\" and it's rough. Plus their baseball team cheats. \n2. Weirdly enough, Miami, Florida. Miami is tricky, because it's not a bad city, it's just not conducive for an Adventure very crowded, lots of clubs. Hard to get things done. I much prefer Orlando or St. Augustine.\n3. Saskatoon, Canada. In a similar vein as miami in the other direction. Where there just isn't very many options. it's a small town in Canada and once you leave the little downtown area, I had trouble finding places to send the player.",

Way smarter than I am. But sometimes really intelligent people get in their own way! \n\nI'm not super business savvy, but one big rule I learned is to make it as easy as possible for people to give you money. It's why i keep pricing simple and my website clear. \n\nI once had a proteg\u00e9 who wanted to password protect his website and have people figure out a puzzle to get in. It's a fun idea, but the front desk employee looking to hire someone to build a 100 person team builder for their company retreat next summer doesn't want to solve a puzzle! \n\nWith that said, I love adding in little easter eggs for people to stumble upon! Reward and delight the people that are into it but don't punish those who just want to hire someone. \n\nSorry for the WAYYYYYY to real answer to your fun comment!",

Before the pandemic hit, I was doing 2 (sometimes 3) a month and that was pretty much it. \n\nOnce the pandemic hit, I realized that I needed to diversify my income. Coming out of it, I have a bigger focus on consulting. Before 2020 about 95% of my income was events and 5% was consulting. Now it looks more like 60/30/10 (The 10% is other forms of revenue like affiliate, shop, finders fees, etc)\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!",

It made for a great loop where they could hit a bunch of stops, but not have to walk for 3 miles. \n\n Let me know if you have any more questions!",

The more you can be honest with yourself and allow yourself to be in the moment with your feelings right now, the less you will feel the need to struggle with them later. I say that knowing how hard this is...the feelings can be quite intense, but they will ebb and flow. Give yourself permission to ride the wave, knowing that it won't always be like this. Spend time with your parents and enjoy the time you have with them right now, in this moment. Let them know how you feel about them. Share memories. Your willingness to be there with them will hopefully be a meaningful experience for all.",

I will quote it below\n\nEdit: u/garysully1986 has kindly informed me that the credit goes to /u/gsnow\n\n&gt;Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents. I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see. As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive. In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life. Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.",

IMO, \"the suck\" wants to focus on everything that doesn't suck and try to make them suck too.

I think just repeating something in my head helps me to disengage \"the suck\" from infecting everything else. It probably gives me a bit more feeling of control too.",

            "comment": "Cancer is something that has affected many people in my family. My father survived kidney cancer but my mother lost her, short, battle with Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) in 2017. Little did we know that she was battling this for two years prior to being diagnosed because it was such a rare and difficult lymphoma to diagnose.   \n\n\nCTCL is a blood cancer but it is not hidden as it affects and attacks the skin. My mom would have blisters, open wounds, and inflamed skin all over her body. It started off as a blister on her nose and within a year it spread to her neck and chest. Six months after that it  was on her torso and arms. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNumerous doctor visits, specialists visits, and hospital visits and no one could  figure out what it was. Before any of this we were looking forward to the first wedding in our family since my Parents, as my wedding was scheduled for May 2016. A few weeks before my wedding after yet another hospital stay for testing and treatment, unbeknownst to me, my mom begged the doctors to give her something so she could be cleared up for the wedding as she was worried about her appearance and how it would embarrass me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoctors agreed and gave her some cocktail that suppressed it for about 2-3 weeks and allowed her to feel good physically, emotionally,  and feel like she looked good. Not going to lie it was a great 2-3 weeks and great to see her happy. However, after it wore off this nasty disease  did not just creep back up it came in full force. Within days she was covered head to toe with blisters, skin was completely red, she said it would feel like someone was peeling her skin off of her when she would put her clothes on or even pull back a sheet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to another hospital stay and more uncertainty from one of the best health systems in the country. One of the doctors recommended transferring her to the burn unit to see if they can mitigate some of the pain and inflammation. Problem is their burn unit was full but we were able to get them to transfer her to another hospital an hour away, the best hospital in the state and  one of the best in the world with the best burn unit too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe doctors at this burn unit put her in a full body suit, as they would to someone who was burned, and it not only gave her some relief from the pain and discomfort but it helped with the open wounds, scabs, and skin to become smooth again, which was shocking because no other treatment was working. It was then  when one of the Burn Unit doctors had did some research and found other cases similar to hers that we were finally able to get an idea of what it was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile in the burn unit the head of the oncology department consulted the burn doctor and ordered some tests and requested all of her medical records from the other health system. That was when she was finally diagnosed, in September 2016, with CTCL stage 4.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe started chemo in pill form and it was not working, and not stopping it from progressing. In December 2016, she started chemo transfusions. Between Jan 2017 and April 2017 she was hospitalized 6  times, with the last time being 6 weeks before she went home with hospice and died on April 9th, which was four days before her 52nd birthday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI shared all this because April is an obvious hard month for me and while I have accepted it and continue to grieve for my Mom, I have never been able to shake this feeling of guilt that because she felt like she needed  to do that cocktail to be cleared  up for my wedding and how that likely made this progress so quickly. Sometimes I can't help but feel like I am the cause of her not being able to beat  it because of that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have done therapy and acknowledge the trauma I have experienced and  it is not as painful   \n as it once was. However, how does one ever overcome, cope or accept that it is not their fault   \n for how f\\*\\*\\*ed up cancer is?",

Your mother wanted to be more comfortable at your wedding, and the doctors provided her with medication that temporarily helped her symptoms. That meant that you had a few wonderful weeks enjoying her company and seeing her happy. That's priceless. While I'm not a physician, I have seen how sometimes after a trial of medications to control symptoms, the cancer appears to come back even stronger. That's a disheartening and confusing thing to witness. I'm glad to hear that therapy has been helpful to you in the past. There is not one right answer to how one can overcome, cope or accept...everyone's experience will be different, but therapy can definitely help.",

I feel that if I had just intervened differently, he might still be here. \n\nI'm not sure if you've ever meditated, but practicing the process of existing with a discomfort (or thought of any kind) without judging your emotions about it or engaging with it trains you to cope. When you try to make yourself feel a certain way, or feel bad about feeling a certain way, it's like getting hit in the face with a wave. It's a lot less taxing to metaphorically dive under the waves as they come by just letting it happen and move through you.\n\nWhat happened to your mom wasn't your fault, but whatever you feel about what happened is okay. Experience it, move through it. It will pass every single time you allow it to do so.",

Oddly though, so far I haven't felt nearly as emotionally affected as I thought I would. I know everyone grieves differently, but how can I assure those around me that I am, so far at least, genuinely accepting/coping? I keep waiting for it all to hit, but to be honest, I'm not sure it will. Unfortunately, I've had a long relationship with death; worked as a crime scene cleanup/mortuary driver, military special operations, and in the healthcare system - so I have come to my own terms with death. I'm just not sure how to have other people realize that and try to inject themselves into my version of coping.\n\nAny advice?",

You are correct about people coping differently and how there is not necessary a right or wrong way to grieve. Most people are quite fearful of death and struggle with their grief, because it's difficult to accept the loss. Given your past experiences, your relationship with death sounds different from that of the average person, so it would make sense that your grief response would also be different. That being said, it sounds like your father was diagnosed fairly recently. So, it's also possible that for you perhaps the emotions will hit a little later on in his cancer journey. However it happens for you, is how it happens for you, and it's okay. Other people may or may not always understand, but it sounds like they are supportive and acting out of concern and love. Just recognize that they are well intentioned in this way, but that your grief journey may be different than theirs.",

I guess another question would be if she has the capacity to make meaningful decisions at this point in her cancer journey. I would take these answers into consideration when deciding on what action would be in her best interest. It's not an easy decision either way.

The reality is always the same in that the future is uncertain.

Many people recommend trying to maintain a \"normal\" routine as much as possible, which can be helpful in generally keeping you grounded and in the present moment. However, if what's normal for you is causing too much stress or isn't congruent with your values, then maybe it's time to take a look at what you spend your time doing.

And I\u2019m not religious, so not much comfort there, though I do believe my mom\u2019s \u201cin a better place\u201d now, but it\u2019s still extremely upsetting to have to witness a slow motion train wreck happen to someone, let alone a person who has endured one rough situation after another. \ud83d\ude1e If there\u2019s no general advice you can give, and it\u2019s more of a case by case basis best suited for working out in therapy, I understand! I do talk to a grief counselor and therapists to help with my many, many issues, including mourning my mom, but just wanted to ask in case you have come up with something you\u2019ve found helps folks in situations like this. Thank you for your time! \ud83d\udc9c",

It makes sense that it would be confusing to see someone so wonderful endure so much suffering in her life. I wish that I had something different to say than what you've already heard from other therapists. Grief is really hard, especially in situations where it feels almost wrong and unjust. Sometimes it can help to work on developing more flexibility in the way you see or talk about things. We can get stuck in our own cycles of thinking and a therapist can sometimes help us to pull back to see a different perspective or see things through a different lens. I can't say that there's an easy fix. You're doing a lot of hard work in therapy, and I encourage you to keep taking care of yourself while finding meaningful ways to remember your mother. Imagine how she might answer this question you posed to me. Sometimes this can be enlightening too.",

It's extremely helpful to have at least one or two people with whom they feel comfortable processing their feelings. It would be great also to refer your friends, loved ones to a support group as well, if they are open to that. The support groups give cancer patients and survivors a place to share with others who are experiencing something similar, so that they don't feel so alone in their experiences. This feeling of community can be very helpful, and it might help them identity other resources or educational things that will benefit them. These wonderful people that you mention, who are acting as therapists for friends and loved ones also need to really stay mindful of their own self care and recognize that they can quickly become depleted if they don't make the time for themselves too.",

Compassion fatigue is not specific only to therapists, but it is definitely a real phenomenon and can interfere with functioning both personally and professionally. For me, I really try to be consistent about my self care routine. I find that meditation and mindfulness activities help me tremendously, so I engage in this exercise daily. I also do yoga and other forms of exercise. Sometimes though, even with all of that self care, I still feel depleted. Those are days when I just notice the feelings, give myself permission to have them and be with them, and I show extra kindness towards myself. Sometimes that means going to sleep a little earlier or putting off a chore for another day, or taking some time off from work. Thank you for this question.",

She was an optimist, fully believing it would just pass with the right therapy, ignoring warning signs of when it was getting worse. I'm more of a depressive realist, I saw the signs and warned her, but it sounded like nagging and just being a pessimist; still managed to make enough of a fuss to get her to a hospital 3 times, right when she was about to die. My father was a scared negationist, scared of taking her to the ER because of all the sick people in there, and diminishing the importance of warning signs, which played right into my mom's playbook of ignoring warning signs completely. Unfortunately, the 4th time, the dynamic broke down; she was getting better, then caught a really nasty cough. I alarmed her that it was a dangerous sign in her condition, she dismissed it as \"just an infection\", lied to me about having told any doctors about it, while my father didn't want to risk taking her to the ER and would rather wait two weeks for her next specialist appointment. I had no strength left to start another fight, all I managed to do was to alert a doctor friend of hers... and the next day she passed away.\n\nI also know a two times cancer survivor, with a balanced approach, who faced it alone both times, with no caretakers to sway her either way.",

I cannot imagine it\u2019s easy and can often be heartbreaking but can see it\u2019s likely very fulfilling.\n\nI know you probably do work intended for human patients, but last year my cat was diagnosed with cancer that ultimately took her life in November. Do you have any general advice for coping with the grief for more aggressive forms, and particularly for the family members who were more directly involved in treatment? I find myself still wondering if there were anything more I could have done to save her as I was the one administering her daily medicine after diagnosis. As a related note, we\u2019re approaching the one year anniversary of her diagnosis and my own cell phone is being brutal bringing up the picture I had to show around a lot relating to it.",

Often our pets are like our little 4-legged fur babies. When it comes time for their passing, it certainly brings on feelings of grief, much like the grief we experience with other losses. It sounds like your kitty had a special place in your life.  I know the Facebook memories can stir up a lot of emotions and bring back a lot of memories, but I wonder if you can try giving yourself the space and opportunity to be with your feelings as you remember how sweet she was.  You did your best by caring for her during her final days and giving her all the love, cuddles and treats she could handle. That\u2019s probably the best thing you could have done for her. Be kind with yourself. Grieving takes time. Give yourself permission to feel and sit with your feelings, as pushing it down or away only causes those feelings to resurface stronger than before. Remember that there are also other sources of support out there if needed, such as bereavement groups or individual counseling.",

I\u2019ve been reading through the comments and it\u2019s almost kind of comforting to read so many stories about cancer. \n\nMy 8 year old son got diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumour 7 months ago, originally they told us he had 12-14 months to live, and because of the placement of the tumour they couldn\u2019t operate on it. We have since then, had the diagnoses contested as the biopsy results indicated a more rare but treatable/curable cancer. \n\nOf course we are elated that his cancer is treatable, and he has since gone through 6 weeks of radiotherapy, and we are now in stage 4 (of 8) rounds of chemotherapy. I feel incredibly amazed by the Drs, nurses and hospital staff who work so hard to help him, and us, it has been an eye opening time for us as a family. \n\nMy questions is, as silly as it might seem, is there a better way of asking \u201chow are you?\u201d Because every single person asks him this, all the time. It\u2019s almost unreal how many times a day we hear this phrase. \nAnd he has told me many times how much he hates being asked this repeatedly\u2026and I\u2019ve told family, friends and school but they often forget, or say it automatically.\n\nI wonder if there is a better way for them to ask/or a phrase we can ask them to use instead?\nOr is it just something we should learn to live with. \nI know that it\u2019s always meant well from the people who ask, but it\u2019s also accumulative over the course of a day for him and is a constant reminder of his situation every time. \n\nAnyone else feel the same?\n\nThank you.",

It sounds like you're doing a great job trying to keep his day to day life as normal as possible, and staying in contact with teachers and school counselors. From a kid's perspective, I get not wanting the constant reminders with people asking \"how are you.\" Maybe it would be helpful to normalize the checking in by asking the teachers to perhaps make it part of their morning routine and check in with all the kids, so your son doesn't feel singled out. Or maybe ask your son how he would like that conversation to go; maybe he has some ideas to make it more fun and less a reminder of his illness.",

Thankfully, there are a lot of wonderful resources available online, through cancer hospitals as well as books and other materials. You're absolutely right though, it's important to think about how the children are impacted by all of this. While children at different developmental stages will need different things when it comes to understanding, accepting, processing about a parent with cancer, the main point is that it's important to keep them included in the family conversation. Most children of any age have a keen sense when their parents are hiding something or keeping something from them, and this can build feelings of resentment and isolation from caregivers. It's generally best to be open and honest with children about the reality of what's happening with their parent's health condition and then give them the space and permission to have their feelings and share them with you. So, first they need to be included and informed in a way that's developmentally appropriate. Second, it's important to inform their school teachers/counselors to keep an eye on them at school in case they need extra support. After all, they spend 8 hours a day in school, so teachers may see things that we don't. Thirdy, I would keep their routine as regular and normal as possible, but if mom or dad is in the hospital, ask the child if he/she wants to see them and give them that choice. Sometimes there's a tendency to want to protect children from sadness and grief, but this simply is not possible and could potentially cause more pain in the long run. Here's a helpful resource on talking with kids in a developmentally appropriate way for different age groups.

The system can be difficult to navigate and stressful, for sure. Communication can be a problem, both among providers and between patients and their providers.

However, these relationships are not always cohesive and there isn't always a reliable point person who can communicate the details back to the patient. You are definitely not alone in your experiences.

I know it can still be scary each time you go in for follow up scans and feel hypervigilant about what sensations in your body could mean. If you have not already started to do this, try developing a gentle mindfulness practice centered around noticing your breath and body. Even 5 minutes a day can be very helpful in developing your awareness and learning to not only sit with what you're noticing in your mind and body, but also learning to let go. Maybe, if you're interested, ask your therapist about this strategy and see if you two can work together on this. I really like the Insight Timer as an app to help support those who are just getting into mindfulness practice as they offer a lot of free guided practices.

Some of the most common challenges faced by those living with cancer include: adjusting to the loss of normalcy, experiencing a loss of identity, grieving over the things they used to do or how they used to be, feeling isolated among friends and family, experiencing a role reversal with partner at home (which also impacts identity and normalcy), and grappling with ongoing uncertainty about treatment outcomes, etc... What can be done to cope with these challenges? Try to focus on what the person can still do and maintain as much normalcy as possible. Give them the space to have their feelings and be willing to listen when they need to talk or cry. Help them stay connected with meaningful activities and with people who are significant to them. Allow them to maintain as much independence as is safely possible. It's also helpful to involve a support group or a therapist to assist further, if needed, and many treatment centers will have counselors, social workers, as well as support groups available to patients.",

Any dogs need to be walked? This is assuming your presence isn't best spent just being by your partner's side. \n\nIn my experience, a lot of people in our family and friendship circle offered unspecific help \"If there's anything I can do.\" and we really didn't ask anyone for anything...But a few people just jumped in - bringing meals, taking my daughter to the park, being beside my wife so I could take a walk in the park. Those people were amazingly helpful. For other's who did not feel comfortable being so forward - I completely understood.",

This is something that I hear very often, that we are often quite concerned about \"burdening\" others, so are unwilling to ask for the help that is needed. Rather, we feel more comfortable when our friends or loved ones jump in without our asking. Those who jump in almost seem to inherently know what to do or what we need in the moment, which is lovely. Our other friends/family who ask for guidance on how to help, need a little direction, but are still very much interested in being there. What I. have heard a lot from the friends and family of someone with cancer, is not knowing what to do or how to help. In these cases, it is helpful to be specific in your requests as these loved ones also want to be involved and show their support. It sounds like you have a wonderful support system.",

At this point, everything is so new that you, your partner and their parents are still processing and have many questions. All of this is completely natural and honestly pretty scary. Having a safe place to talk about those feelings is really important, rather than trying to avoid their emotions. So it's helpful for your partner to know that what he's experiencing emotionally right now is normal and okay, and encourage him to share if you're comfortable being the sounding board. At this point, there are many questions and unknowns which can cause anxiety on a number of levels. Trying to take things just one day at a time is helpful. Focusing on what's happening right now, in this moment rather than thinking too far into the future. Engaging in regular dialogue with your loved ones to offer support and let them know you're available to listen, is invaluable.",

It's an important discussion to have with your loved ones and also with your medical providers. Perhaps additional treatment is not the route you want to take, and in that case, you have other options such as palliative care, which addresses your symptom burden, so that you can experience better quality of life. These choices are yours and they are important.

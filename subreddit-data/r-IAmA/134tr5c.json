    "postText": "Hi all (posted with Mod approval),\n\nAfter about 20 years of working for big banks and financial institutions in South Africa on Credit Risk Management, the last 6 of which through my own one-man consultancy business, I came across a Unity game development tutorial on YouTube in February of 2019. This kicked off the nerdiest mid-life crisis I'm aware of...\n\nI had no previous Unity or C# experience, but had done a lot of technical programming in the data analysis and modelling arena. Unity become a very dedicated hobby and in December of 2019 I started working on a Colony Builder after coming across a Hex Map tutorial (by Catlike Coding). I suddenly knew I could fulfil a life-long dream and develop a decent game.\n\nAfter 2 years in committed hobby mode, I took the plunge and started working on World Turtles full-time in November 2021, living off of my savings. Eventually, I teamed up with a publisher, and World Turtles has just launched into Early Access on Steam, Epic Games and GOG, with &gt;3,500 followers and tens of thousands of wish lists on Steam, which means that staying a game developer full time could be a realistic prospect!\n\n**World Turtles on...**\n\nSteam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1512050/World\\_Turtles/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1512050/World_Turtles/)\n\nEpic Games Store: [https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/world-turtles-b2139d](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/world-turtles-b2139d)\n\nGOG: [https://www.gog.com/en/game/world\\_turtles](https://www.gog.com/en/game/world_turtles)\n\nYouTube Trailer: [https://youtu.be/L79WX62sUX8](https://youtu.be/L79WX62sUX8)\n\nYouTube Game Play: [https://youtu.be/u9-xhdFWkoE?t=49](https://youtu.be/u9-xhdFWkoE?t=49)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Proof:**\n\n(Picture with username and date - note Imgur seems to be temporarily down, but the image is there!): [https://imgur.com/uLllnZ0](https://imgur.com/uLllnZ0)\n\n(Stream - linking the picture above to me) [https://youtu.be/26FGH5tmhAk?t=54](https://youtu.be/26FGH5tmhAk?t=54)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ask me anything!Note: it's launch day, so I'll spend as much time here as I can and return in the morning!**",

So they made i want to say 3x in revenue what they spent in marketing. We got 1/3 of that. But their PROFIT after giving us 1/3 was thus just 2x ad spend.  I guess that\u2019s good?

You need to feed the Turtle to keep it from starving, and also to steer it to / away from certain part of space that impact your humidity, temperature, flux (power), etc. There will be more \"things\" in space to also interact with later. Snow comets accumulate on the flippers and crash down one your stuff from time to time. The turtle also flies through areas of gas pollution, and you need to stockpile enough water to cater for this.",

Take small steps and see whether the \"returns\" keep getting bigger as you take them. Just to give you an example - it took me 14 months to get just under 4,000 wishlists. I'd put a lot of effort into making the game rather than trying to market it. Then, because of the quality of the game, I got into some events and suddenly gained over 9,000 in 5 months.

I had always been wondering what the impact of making a game can have on the devs themselves, but I always had a guess that since the moment their game is launched their lives will be changed forever, potentially their path in the future has been completely altered and that rest of their lives are just centered around the game they created. I'm wondering whether this is correct, or whether you have some insights into this.\n\n&gt;and you have to consider many factors\n\nHow probable is it to develop a mid sized to big game as a hobby? Like you have your regular work stuff and you develop a game in your free time? Is this probable? Cuz then at least you have an income and progress on the game is slow but consistent?",

I really want to continue working full-time on the game, but if income isn't enough, I'll have to split my time between my \"adult job\" and my \"play job\". I think having a profitable enough \"adult job\" makes it possible. I'm fortunate enough that I can earn enough to support us if I work half-day, but I can also understand that I'm in an \"outlier\" position. Having a full-time day-job would make it much harder.\n\nI love working on the game, and would like to add loads more to it. Even if it doesn't sell as well as I hope, I probably will still keep working on it for the enjoyment, as a hobby that brings in a little bit from time to time. Yes, launching a game can be a very long term commitment, but I also think you don't have to be chained to it for decades if you don't want to be. Spending a few months or a year, you could get it to a point where it can be considered \"complete enough\", and move on.",

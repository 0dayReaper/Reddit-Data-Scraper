While some studies have shown stem cell therapy might be able to promote hair growth and greater hair density, additional research is needed to confirm these results.\n\nStem cells are pluripotential cells which mean they can change to create different tissues. Hair stem cells have been a subject of many studies. We know stem cells could be used to make new hair in certain conditions. This has not been fully researched for safety and is not being practiced currently. However, stem cells from other areas such as fat tissue have been harvested and injected into the scalp to stimulate the hair growth. At this point, we don't have enough solid evidence that this procedure can help hair growth.",

The suggestion that the results might not be as good as a more traditional procedure could be related to the fact that only a limited number of grafts can be transplanted per session. Someone who needs a higher number of grafts, or is experiencing a higher stage of hair loss, would require multiple sessions or they might be better suited for traditional FUE hair transplantation.",

Good question!\n\nThe total cost depends on the amount of hair grafts that are used by the surgeon, the area of the country where it is performed, the hair transplant technique used, and any additional fees charged by the doctor or the surgeon. There are some medical offices who offer specials or payment plans which can certainly help with the cost. If they do not offer a payment plan, they might work with a financing company such as Care Credit or Lending Club. The doctor you have in mind for the surgery should be able to answer these questions for you.",

    "postText": "Hello reddit!\n\nMy name is Brent and with my friend Jon purchased the former mining town of \u201cCerro Gordo\u201d this past July 13th (Friday the 13th). The town was originally established in 1865 and by 1869 they were pulling 340 tons of bullion out of the mountain for Los Angeles. \n\nThe silver from Cerro Gordo was responsible for building Los Angeles. The prosperity of Cerro Gordo demanded a larger port city and pushed LA to develop quickly.  \n\nThe Los Angeles News once wrote:\n\n\u201cWhat Los Angeles is, is mainly due to it. It is the silver cord that binds our present existence. Should it be uncomfortably severed, we would inevitably collapse.\u201d\n\nIn total, there has been over $17,000,000 of minerals pulled from Cerro Gordo. Adjusted for inflation, that number is close to $500,000,000.\n\nIt\u2019s been a wild ride so far owning a \u2018ghost town\u2019 and we\u2019re having a lot of fun figuring out what to do with it. \n\nYou can follow along with us on Instagram here: https://www.instagram.com/brentwunderwood/\n\nOr you can put in email on this link to be emailed updates: http://brentunderwood.com/r-iama-friday-april-19/\n\nHere are a couple links with more background:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/us/cerro-gordo-ghost-town-california.html\nhttps://www.cnn.com/travel/article/ghost-town-sold-cerro-gordo/index.html\n\nWould love to chat towns, history, real estate, whatever reddit may have in mind. AMA!\n\nPROOF: http://brentunderwood.com/r-iama-friday-april-19/\n\nEDIT: Headed to Cerro Gordo tomorrow. If you have question for Robert [message me on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/brentwunderwood/) and I'll ask a few of them live for IG story",

So for the past 21 years he has lived on the mountain, protecting the town from the elements (and any potential looters).\n\nThe first day I asked Robert if he was ever scared of living up there. He said no, he always had his two friends, Smith and Wesson, with him....",

They could go the easier route though and just get it recommended eligible for listing which has the same protections as an actual listing, just not the added potential grant money for renovations.\n\nSince it's on private land the only way they would be required to have it archaeologically and architecturally recorded would be if they got federal money to do some work on it. If they keep the funding private then they can do almost anything they want. California probably has some laws so they can't just bulldoze it tomorrow, but if they took the proper steps they probably could.",

I have a hospitality project in Austin, TX as well that is in a historic building. So we started looking for properties within a few hours of major cities that had history attached to them. We looked in the Catskills outside NYC for a while. \n\nOur friend Aaron forwarded us the listing for this and it was just too perfect. We went out the next day to meet with former owners and Robert. It's been a lot of fun",

Putting a shop near the beginning of town or the road that splits there is necessary. You look at towns like Bodie and find they get good advertisement from local towns like June, Mammoth, and Bridgeport but nobody knows about this place. I would love to visit but had no idea it was even there. Another great place would be lone pine, they have Mt Whitney and very little fishing, thats it, adding a bill board or outpost of some sort wpuld guarantee more visitors. You are on one of the most scenic and traveled highways in the US, take advantage of it!! Hope all goes well!",

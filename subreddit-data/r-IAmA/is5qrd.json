    "postText": "I\u2019ve been involved in nuclear energy since 1947.  In that year, I started working on nuclear energy at Argonne National Laboratories on safe and effective handling of spent nuclear fuel. In 2018 I retired from government work at the age of 92 but I continue to be involved in learning and educating about safe nuclear power.\n\nAfter my time at Argonne, I obtained a doctorate in Chemical Engineering from MIT and was an assistant professor there for 4 years, worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for 18 years where I served as the Deputy Director of Chemical Technology Division, then for the Atomic Energy Commission starting in 1972, where I served as the Director of General Energy Development. In 1984 I was working for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, trying to develop a long-term program for nuclear waste repositories, which was going well but was ultimately canceled due to political opposition.\n\nSince that time I\u2019ve been working primarily in the US Department of Energy on nuclear waste management broadly \u2014 recovery of unused energy, safe disposal, and trying as much as possible to be in touch with similar programs in other parts of the world (Russia, Canada, Japan, France, Finland, etc.) I try to visit and talk with people involved with those programs to learn and help steer the US\u2019s efforts in the right direction.\n\nMy daughter and son-in-law will be helping me manage this AMA, reading questions to me and inputing my answers on my behalf.  (EDIT: This is also being posted from my son-in-law's account, as I do not have a Reddit account of my own.) Ask me anything.\n\nProof: [**https://i.imgur.com/fG1d9NV.jpg**](https://i.imgur.com/fG1d9NV.jpg)\n\nEDIT 1: After about 3 hours we are now wrapping up.\u00a0 This was fun. I've enjoyed it thoroughly!\u00a0 It's nice to be asked the questions and I hope I can provide useful information to people. I love to just share what I know and help the field if I can do it.\n\nEDIT 2: Son-in-law and AMA assistant here!  **I notice many questions about nuclear waste disposal.** **I will highlight** [**this answer**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/is5qrd/ive_had_a_71year_career_in_nuclear_energy_and/g55vkkp/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that includes thoughts on the topic.\n\nEDIT 3: Answered one more batch of questions today (Monday afternoon).  Thank you all for your questions!",

And ultimately I think what China realizes is the sooner they can expand their nuclear power, the better the environment will be, especially in the larger cities.\n\nObviously their economy is growing rapidly, and any growing economy requires a growth in electrical energy.\u00a0 Most of China's power currently comes from coal, but nuclear can step in and take some of that burden.",

So I\u2019m not convinced that it is priced out of reach.\n\nSmall reactors still have a higher cost per kilowatt hour. They are a more expensive source of energy than large reactors. However they have one virtue which really attracts people: They can be built in increments and get online sooner. Big reactors can get delayed and delayed and the whole time you\u2019re paying ongoing construction costs. There\u2019s no question that being able to get online and get some income while doing increments, that is an advantage. In the long run that may turn out to be an overwhelming advantage that gives small-scale reactors a better bet.",

France did that with the Messmer plan. Japan and SK did it with their serial production and their construction costs and build times were just as low. Currently Russia and China are doing the same kind of mass manufacture and their costs are affordable.\n\nIf you (I mean the country collectively) decide to actually build them, there is no cost problem or time of construction problem. It only exists as long as you can't actually agree that you want to build.\n\nSmall reactors have genuine advantages and use cases for remote places, islands, ships of course, and for countries with smaller power requirements (because you don't want a single 1 GW reactor if your country only consumes 1.5 GW on average).\n\nBut for large grids and large consumers, the large plants always make more sense.",

Hence, the plans (that assume people do what they are supposed to do) being some much different than the outcome (a shit ton of rework due to clowns working on it).",

The answer is yes, but they do it by creating the energy in central stations and using it to charge batteries.  \n\nThere is no question that electricity can drive vehicles.  We already know that, we're doing it.  It's the source!  An electric-transported vehicle, broadly speaking, depends on the source!  If you get the electricity from a gasoline engine that's mounted in the car, ultimately the energy is based upon gasoline.  If you operate a car with a plug-in that allows you to go two or three hundred miles\u2026 it's the source of *that* electricity!\n\nIn DC we have 2 or 3 nuclear power plants that produce maybe 30% of the electricity.  People that plug in their electric car are taking electricity from the grid and 30% of that in the DC area is nuclear.",

Cost and complexity, as well as regulations, have been major burdens to private nuclear vessels. \n\nThe military can afford to train legions of nuclear technicians to continually monitor and operate the dozens of nuclear vessels in the fleet. For a shipping company, unless they decided to build an entire new nuclear fleet, they don't have the advantage of that economy of scale.\n\nThere's also the matter of the technology itself. Only a few companies have the know-how to build nuclear ships, and, unsurprisingly, a lot of their work is for the military, and, as such, classified. The cost of developing such technology independently is huge as well.\n\nSimilarly, fuel costs, while a factor for cargo ships, are not a major issue. For cargo ships traveling known routes, fuel costs can be calculated, and fuel loaded in such a way as to minimize costs. The reason navies like nuclear is that, in combat, avoiding the downtime that refueling takes, as well as the risks inherent in running out of fuel, or the vulnerable position that refueling at sea puts ships in is a good trade off for greater complexity.\n\nNuclear ships are also great if you need to provide a lot of power for things not related to propelling the ship. While some ships use electric motors powered by combustion engines, many still drive their propellers directly. For a cargo ship, that's fine. Propulsion is 98% of the game, and providing power for the various ships systems used by the relatively small crew can be handled by auxiliary generators.\n\nA carrier is more like a small airport afloat. Between the catapults, aircraft elevators, the weapon systems, and the equipment used by the small city of people aboard, a significant portion of the power a carrier generates goes to places other than propelling the ship.\n\nFinally, the legal hoops that a private entity would have to go through to get permission to operate a nuclear cargo ship would be astronomical. On top of the regulations present in the nation of construction and registration, any port the ship might want to enter could turn it away for fear of nuclear accident.\n\nA military navy can avoid a lot of the red tape a private entity might encounter, and military ships typically don't dock anywhere other than home or allied ports, both of which don't have much of a say in weather the ship is allowed to dock.",

This means that patrols can be extended and that a carrier can be deployed anywhere, anytime.  \nThere's probably something about trusting private companies with nuclear fuel travelling around the world as well, but you can guarantee that if it were cheaper to build &amp; operate nuclear freight vessels, operators would be on it like a rat up a drainpipe.",

It separates the fuel that remains in the waste from the fission products, mostly which simply need to be disposed of safely. But the recycling is something I\u2019ve been interested in for decades.  Ultimately, it allows virtually all of the uranium to be used (both U-235, and U-238).\n\nRight now there are economic issues. In order to recycle economically you need to do it at a very large scale. France and Russia actually each have a plant that does at least one round of recycling.  India has an experimental program around this. China is leading the pack in terms of future plans. The US does not currently do any recycling.",

The issues, from what I understand, come down to mostly three things: economic feasibility, total waste utilization, and regulation changes.\n\nThe first is just that storing waste indefinitely and mining more fuel is currently cheaper than recycling. This is unfortunate, since it removes one of the primary (realistic) driving forces that could cause a push for used nuclear fuel recycling. \n\nThe second part involves the many, many different isoptopes present in nuclear fuel after it comes out of a reactor. There are places (some US facilities in the recent past) that recycle the uranium and plutonium out of this fuel, but leave everything else for disposal. Methods have been developed for extracting many of the other serious isotopes such as strontium or cesium (notably by Oak Ridge National Lab in the mid 1900s), but these aren\u2019t currently used anywhere that I know of. Even if those two were extracted as well, there will still be radioactive waste as a by-product, and it will be in a less ideal form for storage after all of the extraction processes. The final issue regarding is that even if we did extract everything that we could from the waste, we would have a lot of isotopes and probably nothing to use them all for; some of them are obvious, like the actinides being recycled into new fuel, but what about the strontium? It makes a decent fuel for RTGs in the form of Strontium Titanate, but is very active and we don\u2019t really have use for that many RTGs right now. \n\nFinally, at least in the US, used nuclear fuel recycling faces major regulation issues. To the best of my knowledge, there isn\u2019t really any robust regulation in the US as there currently is for, say, reactor operation. This would be a very involved and drawn out process, even if everybody involved was completely on board and agreed on everything. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware, nuclear energy has a ton of red tape around it, and is taken incredibly seriously from a safety perspective, and this is a major limitation when pushing for advances in the technology for the industry. \n\nPersonally, I feel that it\u2019s a wonderful idea. However, if we were to do it we should take it all the way and take it seriously. More uses would need to be found for the various extra table isotopes, and perhaps better methods of waste storage would need to be developed for the small amount of by-product that would be left over.",

Many people do not understand that all nuclear waste (including spent fuel) is legally owned by the Federal Government.  Commercially, the waste is taken care of by the power plant that generated it, but the Feds own it.  It has been this way since day 1.  The Federal Government decided that civilian nuclear power could exist but proliferation risks were so great that they should own all used fuel.  The Federal Government then entered into a contractual relationship with all operating nuclear power plants.  \"Y'all give us a tenth of a cent on the dollar, and we promise that we will get rid of the spent fuel, you don't have to worry about it\".  So all the power plants are in this deal, perpetually paying the feds to dispose of the waste, then suing the government for the costs of storing it due to breach of contract.\n\nThe government has no political incentive to deal with the stuff, nor do they have a monetary incentive to reprocess, recycle or otherwise make physical use of it.  The power plants themselves don't have any legal standing to do any of those things either.  So it just sits in limbo.\n\nCompare this to apocryphal stories of the early days of Proctor and Gamble, where a candlemaker and soapmaker brother in law saw all of the waste fat from pork slaughterhouses in Cincinatti and said \"We'll take this stuff out of your factory for free if you let us have it to make things with\".\n\nWaste is the same way.  No innovation because there is no ability to do anything with it.",

Easily one of the worst environmental disasters in history if it happened. That's just to keep it in low earth orbit for a day or so. For longer, you'll need constant boosting to avoid it coming back to earth due to atmospheric drag. If you want to put it way farther away (let's say lunar height), that will significantly cut down the mass you could move upwards into space at a time.\n\nIt's just not feasible and way more dangerous than storing it pretty much anywhere else in the planet.

I left there in 1972.\n\nIn these experimental efforts, the reactor actually operated successfully, and it actually involved thorium. But there are many problems to be solved, and it did not prove a commercial feasibility, and there is a lot of work to do improving materials of construction that will withstand the environment, and long-term stabilizing of the system. It\u2019s a longer shot than other approaches, but is still feasible.",

Corrosion during transport is simply not an issue, you dont transport it in a corrosive state when you have on site chemical processing capability. \n\nThe chemistry surrounding \"chemical kidneys\" for salt reactors is far more a challenge.  It's also something we're very good at because all other industries use liquid/gas chemistry.   If you wanted to reprocess spent fuel to reduce waste, one of the first steps is getting the solid fuel pellets dissolved into a salt.",

It\u2019s an unusual situation. They don\u2019t have as many reactors as the US but they decided decades ago to make that their primary source of energy. But it\u2019s interesting that they\u2019re shutting down old reactors, and have a commitment to REDUCE their dependence on nuclear power to 50%, whether it\u2019s hydro or coal or natural gas. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to save money, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily improve the environment, but much of their constituency feels 75% is just too high of an amount.",

The consensus of the scientific community is that it is safe. I talked more in another answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/is5qrd/ive_had_a_71year_career_in_nuclear_energy_and/g55sqko/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) about some of the safety details of that approach.\n\nIn the US there is a good deal of power in the hands of the states.  So there's a question of whether you can do something safely in America, where there might be a national commitment but the states might be resistant, even to transport waste to the site.  But that issue does not exist in Finland.  They do not have provinces which have almost veto power (which is what really happened in Nevada, with the Yucca Mountain project I talked about in the link above). \n\nAlso, suppose a baby is born, and for their whole lifetime the only power they use is nuclear. It turns out the amount of nuclear waste they would generate over their entire lifetime is just two Coca-Cola cans!  So the question is, can you safely dispose of something like that?  The answer is, yes, with deep geologic disposal.",

It's not like nuclear waste is in danger of suddenly becoming fissile again, so for the most part the goal is to bury it somewhere that there isn't really anything else that could be damaged by whatever small-ish (relatively) amounts of radiation it's giving off. One such place would be WAAAAAAY deep underground, presumably far enough that it's far below the water table so that it doesn't irradiate drinking water, and there's nothing that lives that deep underground, so you just kind of bury it there, forget about it, and eventually it decays to the point of being fully safe.",

There are also likely plenty of bad autocorrects and a lot of bad grammar, so you have your warning.\n\nThe coke can analogy, does this account for byproducts of production or just purely spent fuel?\n\nAlso this would result in needing 7.4 km^3 for all the people on earth today, which is a growing population. I am also assuming this is based on more modern efficiencies, rather than the types of systems we are decommissioning. Which again, is not just spent fuel, but all the materials that are used in contact with the fuel that are now contaminated. Not to mention the ever growing cost of decommissioning.\n\nBecause that\u2019s the other problem with nuclear energy, it\u2019s not that it can\u2019t be done safely, it\u2019s just that safety costs so much that that it invalidates any argument for the cost of the fuel and the efficiency of the system. The cost of decommissioning sites is only going to grow, especially as space for spent fuel gets used up and new sites have to be zoned. Especially as safety standards change and rightfully so.  Not to mention the difficulty in actually tearing down the reinforced structures that are required to safely run a generator. Many sites remain in place, useless because they are so expensive to properly remove. And because there is no standard for waste disposal, the waste sits hastily buried on site, until a storage facility can be agreed on for burial.\n\nAlso it\u2019s great that it might only take 2 coke cans. But in the case of the US if even half the population gets nuclear energy, that\u2019s over 300,000,000 coke cans, just for those alive today, that you are now storing in a concentrated area. So yeah, a couple coke cans are no problem. Now what do you do with those hundreds of millions.  Something that will remain toxic for thousands of years, how do you manage that, 1,000 years ago America wasn\u2019t even on a map. There are entire cities that have been lost to history, even in the US there are sites we find randomly forgotten over our just 500 year history. The modern English language isn\u2019t even really over 1,000 years old and would be be barely recognizable to many around that time and before. Yet we are dealing with some fuels that have half-life\u2019s over 150,000 years. While they may not pose the same dangers as depicted in media and during disasters. It\u2019s still not something that would be said to be safe, especially once concentrated into a single site. This again disregards the tons of byproducts from mining the ore to refining the fuel. Which contain both radioactive waste as well as other hazardous toxic materials that need to be managed.  I know that last argument tends to go along with anything mined, but it\u2019s still ignored regularly when arguing the waste created by nuclear energy is so small.\n\nBut back to my previous point. We don\u2019t know what information storage and exchange will look like in 100 years, let alone compared to 10,000 years. Even in the last 30 years of the internet, there is still information and sites that have been entirely lost.  We take for granted this idea that information is so readily available. But it\u2019s only readily available if it is maintained and you know where to find it. Look at ho many issues we have with government databases and their accessibility to different services and municipalities. Furthermore, if a private entity takes up this initiative, if that company shuts down or ownership gets transferred one or more times, that info might be somewhere,  but no one that knows where it is is there anymore.\n\nAs technology advances you have to make the decision to either continue running a decades if not centuries out of date system that maintains the database, that in 30 years, let alone 1,000 no one will be around to repair or resolve issues with. Or you continuously upgrade and update the inventory, which may require replacing the labels and trackers on millions of containers.\n\nAll of this points out, not just a logistical issue, but a cultural future historical, as well as a never ending financial one. How much does it cost to run a highly secured site, running full redundant systems to ensure safety and security for 1,000+ years for a population that will roughly double in size every 100 years.  The cost doesn\u2019t stop at the cost of building the plant and purchasing the fuel. Decommissioning can cost 3x the price of construction, sometimes more with delays and finding contracts to handle the waste, and well equipped workers to handle the contaminated materials. And even then, a facility in operation for thousands of years to manage the spent fuel and byproducts.\n\nThe point is the whole picture is never really seen in entirety. It\u2019s always broken down into it\u2019s smallest points or it\u2019s largest positive values. Like two coke cans, or how many megawatts a plant produces. But not how much that plant costs, how long that play will take to go live, how much it will cost to inevitably decommission it, and how much it costs the store the millions of coke cans of wade and byproducts for thousands of years. And how we can possibly believe we will reliably track that when we haven\u2019t even been using computers regularly for over 50 years, and storage for a time longer than we have had written langue and civilizations. The instability we have witnessed over the last 5 years in the world governments should be proof enough that we can\u2019t possibly expect to be able to maintain this info, when over night, the department that exists to do so, can be defunded and all the employees let go. Even if there is a public database that could be kept, it would have to neglect a lot of info for security reasons.",

I found [this](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1908/ML19080A208.pdf) one related to waste handling at San Onofre run by Southern California Edison. It was related to the incident outlined [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMnOEBq5Imk), and they were fined $116,000 for it in 2019. Mind you, this was a minor incident relative to the kind of scale we're imagining in this thread. It's like finding a dent on a rental car. So I'm hoping anything on a level that would immediately endanger humans would warrant fines of hundreds of millions of dollars.",

They still have guards to prevent anyone from tampering with it, but do not otherwise require additional maintenance.\n\nAlso, this is important! 1.8 billion years ago there was a natural nuclear reactor that operated in what is now the country of Gabon in Western Africa. It operated for hundreds of thousands of years, shut down itself, produced a ton of plutonium, and life has since done pretty well!",

This was right next to a nuclear test site where 900 nuclear tests had been done with no containment. So a well-contained waste disposal site should have been very safe. \n\nOur research included a performance assessment showing it would handle waste safely for at least 50,000 years. Not only should that should be perfectly safe, but as a backup there could be test wells in the nearby land to monitor the aquifer (1000 feet below the repository site anyway) that would detect if there was any radioactivity present in the aquifer, and if it \\*were\\* detected, that could be removed using ion exchange.  \n\nBut the most important thing about this site, from a long-term perspective, is that the aquifer drained into Death Valley. It didn\u2019t drain into the Colorado River or any other water source that would cause any problems 100,000 years from now.",

There's an astonishing amount of engineering work already in place!\n\nFirst lets discuss the Fukushima disaster and how that might have happened at a US plant by examining our safety related electrical equipment and their backups.\n\nFirst we have two safety related (extremely high fidelity equipment tested consistently) transformers usually a start up and unit aux to provide power during outages or transients. If and only if those fail do we move to the UPS power supplied electrical buses. They're fed from two diverse (meaning no connections between the two for a common cause fault) battery banks which each have their own Emergency Diesel Generators. They're usually the size of a destroyer's main engine.\n\nNow assuming one diesel was getting maintenance that day and the other caught fire. You'd be in a situation called \"station blackout\" which the unit was actually designed for. We'll discuss why that isn't the end of your electrical power first by moving onto the usually 2-3 auxiliary Station Blackout Diesels (SBO) these provide electricity in the event you lose your two EDGs to continue charging the UPS. We're now 4 failures deep, switchyard has 2, and edgs have 2. \n\nIf we lose station blackout power, smaller gasoline powered generators can be connected and used. But we'd reach a criteria where we use a steam driven aux feedwater pump. The reactor will generate 7% of its prior heat every hour after shutdown, however due to the design of the reactor core and the steam generators, water continues to flow in the typical path due to fluid and thermodybamics. Hot water goes up and into steam generators and flows back down to the cold leg to get reheated and sent back up. The water is kept pressurized through a vessel with an air bubble. \n\nAt this time boric acid is being added to reduce reactivity further and the control rods also cause the reactor to \"shutdown\" meaning the chain reaction slows rapidly approx 93% every hour. You might go from 3600 Megawatts thermal to 250 in the first hour. This heat is enough to produce steam in the steam generators which turns a steam driven turbine to cool the steam generators to make steam to feed it. It's a passive system meaning no external power needed until the core can't produce steam. \n\nThe spent fuel pool has approximately 1-2 days before it boils. Meaning if we do nothing we have over a day. We however have gas generators to power coolant to the spent fuel pool if we've lost 7 other power sources.\n\nWe're not even to the point where we make it rain acid to eat the reactor but since this isn't a two hour lecture I'll just leave a bit of good news. A containment dome can withstand two F-16s hitting it at full velocity with their explosive payload and still be standing. A dome with a concrete, rebar matrix protects the public from any accident we happen to cook up. \n\nTMI was a crew who did everything wrong because their plant wasn't a nuclear sub. We've learned from it in the states. It was cycle 1 and the porv was stuck but they didn't trust indicators and didn't bother checking backup indication.\n\nChernobyl was typical Soviet ignorance in the face of politics vs science.\n\nFukushima was a shift manager who was too honour bound to use his hydrogen recombiner until it was too late. His younger peer used it on the other half of the site and didn't have an issue despite the same flooding. \n\nEach unit has a team of about 50-120 engineers (sometimes they're a corporate pool not that some plants are that understaffed) keeping everything in the green with a crew of highly trained operators and professional maintenance staffs. We've got this. We've plan for a hurricane in Kansas. A tornado in New York. And everyone can take an 8.5 magnitude earth quake with fake bravado and an intact unit.",

                    "comment": "Lot of incorrect responses to your comment here. I'm actually a nuclear engineer working in the fusion field, so I can help give some guidance. \n\nThere are two branches of fusion: public and private. Public is ITER (they have a fantastic website I recommend checking out). Back in the day researchers and their many scaling laws all said \"bigger is better\", but by big it was almost prohibitively expensive for any one country. So the entire world (US, EU, China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia) decided to go all in building this monster of machine. It's currently under construction in France with an estimated cost of somewhere around $10 billion (more than CERN!). The first plasma will be in 2025, and demonstration of fusion power should be shortly after 2035. ITER will operate till around 2050, but will not actually put power onto the grid. This will be done with the next device, DEMO, much of which depends on ITER. It's all extremely exciting, and is some of the most impressive fears of engineering ever done. \n\nOn the private side, they go off more recent scaling laws that suggest \"high magnetic field is better\". So they build compact machine with superconductors to make really strong magnetic fields. In theory it's a cheaper, and smaller device. The main players here are Tokamak Energy in the UK and CFS in Boston as a spin-off of MIT. They plan to demonstrate fusion power well before 2050, and have convinced some very rich people to give them money to do it! \n\nAll in all, the long standing joke \"it's always 20, 30, 40, etc. years away\" is no longer applicable. We are extremely close! At the risk of hyperbole, I like to say that when fusion is achieved it will begin the next era of mankind. Bronze, Iron, Industrial, Space, and then Fusion! I personally think that, for example, if you are a Millennial or younger, you will live to see fusion energy and will be able to give your children a much cleaner, safer and energy plenty world than we've been given.",

                    "comment": "Many reactors today are designed to be \"walk away safe\" or passively safe.  No such commercial designs have been built.  Generally speaking, operating reactors are extremely safe and built in stable areas where funding to prevent an accident wouldn't be an issue.  Long term, all that is really needed is some cooling water.\n\nThe NuScale design just received its design certification from the NRC and has a safety case where the reactors are indefinitely cooled without human intervention.\n\nMany sodium cooled reactors use passive heat removal systems and don't require human intervention.\n\nThe HTGR is designed to be passively safe.\n\nMolten salt reactors generally have a dump tank that is a deeply sub-critical geometry that can be cooled indefinitely without human intervention.  Because they operate at high temperatures they can also use systems similar to those in sodium cooled and gas cooled reactors.\n\nMost advanced reactor designs utilize these passive safety features.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m personally skeptical because of the recent and ongoing cost overruns and construction delays at Plants Vogtle and VC Summer. As you probably know, Summer was eventually canceled and Vogtle is now several billion dollars over its initial estimated construction cost, and years past it\u2019s original planned completion date. It\u2019s been through 3 EPCs. Westinghouse went bankrupt. Meanwhile, comparable NGCC plants can be finished in 2 years for a fraction of the price. \n\nHow can nuclear generation overcome this enormous difference in speed and cost? \n\nRelated- why not invest in utility scale storage and grid interconnection technology for wind and solar - which continue decreasing in cost and increasing in efficiency- rather than cumbersome, expensive new reactors like Vogtle and Summer?",

                    "comment": "Vogtle and summer were both first-of-a-kind AP1000 reactors. The ballooned costs associated with these builds are primarily due to the inexperience of the workforce and unfavorable fluctuating interest rates. The workforce in United States has no experience building reactors in this results in unscheduled construction delays and ballooning interest rates. Westinghouse could not absorb those costs and subsequently went bankrupt. It was a gamble and it didn\u2019t pay off. Now that\u2019s not to say that a $21 billion nuclear plant is a financial black hole or wasteful spending. If completed these plans will typically generate 300-400 billion dollars in their 60 to 80 year lifespan. Now first-of-a-kind reactors or any large projects for that matter are expected to be costly expenditures initially. It\u2019s only after the learning curve progresses in the workforce sufficiently acquires enough experience through repetition, with favorable interests rates, costs drop as levels economies of scale are reached. China and South Korea both have acquired experience and have reached economies of scale. [They both are capable of building reactors at 1/6 the cost to that of US reactor costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/opinion/sunday/climate-change-nuclear-power.html) in a fraction of the time. So in short, first-of-a-kind reactor builds are not representative of later iterations as experience/economies of scale is acquired. There 7 specific policy measures that should be implemented to achieve cheap nuclear (3-5 billion dollars per plant). https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull58-4/5842021.pdf\n \nThat being said, these first-of-a-kind reactors at 21 billion dollars is still bargain prices considering for the total revenue generated in their lifespan. It\u2019s a common misconception that renewables are cheaper than nuclear plants. This is patently false. Intermittent renewables do not produce reliable forms of power and therefore cannot be pitted against nuclear plants on their own. Intermittent renewables are typically paired with fossil fuels and functionally operate as fuel savers not power plants. So comparing fuel savers to fully operating nuclear power plant is not a accurate analysis. It would be like comparing golf carts to semi-trucks for freight. For a true apples to apples comparison, industrial renewables + storage costs must weighed against nuclear power plants with the same capacity factor. Comparing this way instantly makes nuclear the more economically attractive option as it\u2019s easily the cheapest option of the two. Primarily this is due to storage being prohibitively expensive at grid-scale. Until seasonal storage becomes extremely cheap, nuclear power plants will always be more economical.",

                    "comment": "The US is not the best case, though also surprisingly not the worst.\n\nThe best recent experience of first of a kind builds has been in China, Japan, and Korea.\n\nOf particular note, KK 6 and 7 (first of a kind ABWRs) were built in about 40 months from first nuclear concrete to first critical and didn't experience large cost overruns.  Why everyone didn't just start building ABWRs after that is hard to say.\n\nThe Koreans have generally built on time and budget, but have been a bit more behind schedule for the UAE export builds. The APR-1400 has a design certification through the NRC.\n\nChina has been pretty successful at keeping cost and time for builds down at several different types of reactors and will probably carry this forward.\n\nRussia has done pretty well deploying the latest VVER designs.\n\nSo I agree that western nations, US, France, Britain, and the Nordic countries haven't done very well deploying nuclear lately.  However, Asia appears to be a completely different story.  The answer might be that western design plants simply lose out to those from other countries.",

    "postText": "Hello Reddit, I'm Tracey McManus. For the last four years, I've reported on the Church of Scientology for the Tampa Bay Times.\n \nFor the last six months, I've been investigating a spate of real estate purchases in downtown Clearwater, Fla. The Church of Scientology and companies run by its members have spent $103 million since 2017 buying about 100 properties. They now own most commercial property on every block within walking distance of the waterfront. We built a [graphic demonstrating just how little is left](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/scientology-clearwater-real-estate/).\n \nDowntown Clearwater is next to a beautiful waterfront just over the bridge from Clearwater Beach, a national tourist destination. Yet downtown is dotted with empty storefronts. The purchases took off as the city was developing a $64 million plan to turn the area around. We don\u2019t know whether these purchases will help the city\u2019s goal.\n \nThe church's tumultuous history in the city starts in 1975, when Scientology bought a downtown hotel with a straw corporation, secretly moved in and wrote plans to take control. I recap the [whole history here](https://www.tampabay.com/news/clearwater/2019/10/20/scientologys-40-years-of-conflict-with-the-city-of-clearwater-recapped/).\n \nIn April 2017, the city snubbed Scientology Leader David Miscavige. Miscavige cut off all communication. Then LLCs controlled by church parishioners began buying up property at an unprecedented rate. In just three years, the downtown footprint of property tied to the church doubled.\n \nThe church has declined to speak with me and criticized my newspaper for portraying its members as \u201cmindless robots.\u201d But defectors from the church and city leaders believe there is little chance parishioners are making all these deals without the church\u2019s involvement.\n \nFor more, [read the investigation here.](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2019/investigations/scientology-clearwater-real-estate/) We also published a story on what [city council members think.](https://www.tampabay.com/news/clearwater/2019/10/20/what-clearwaters-city-council-thinks-about-scientologys-downtown-takeover/)\n \nTimes data reporter and graphics wiz u/elimurray is also around to answer questions about how he made the graphics (check out another amazing project [here](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2016/breaking-news/orlando-nightclub-shooting/choice-chance-3d-map/). You may remember him from his popular AMA on [Zombie Campaigns](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7vnria/were_the_reporters_who_found_100_former/) last year).\n \n[PROOF](https://twitter.com/TroMcManus/status/1186673817873244161?s=20)\n\nEDIT: Y'all! Our server hosting the main investigation is down, so you can't read the story right now. We're trying to fix it ASAP. We're bummed. In the meantime, I'll still be here, answering your questions! Please check back later to read the story.\n\nEDIT2: We've stabilized the server and the story should be back up and running - hopefully you can check it out now if you were having trouble earlier. Thanks!\n\nEDIT3: Ok all, I'm headed out. But I will try to hop on later to answer a few more questions. Thank you so very much for your interest in our investigation and for all the comments expressing support for local journalism. We will keep on it!\n\nEdit4: I'm back! For a little while until I get too sleepy ... jumping back into questions now. \nAsk us anything.\n\nEdit 5: That's it for tonight. Thank you all again for your interest in our reporting!",

We have never had an association with the church and the house was owned by the original builders of the home (my wifes family) who also used to own property downtown. \n\nThey are scum.  They would follow and photograph me whenever i would ride my bike downtown.\n\n\nEdit: they even showed up asking about my parents by name.  My parents were not associated with any loans or bills and had no ties to the area or church.  My only tie was my wife\u2019s family who built the house and owned a lot of real estate in the area from the 40s on. They sold most by the late 80s.",

We didn\u2019t have many problems with them because they were keeping a low profile.  The main problem we had was their daycare losing toddlers.  If we called they would deny that they were missing a child.  We would turn the child over to social services, then 24 hours later they would have one of their security people call to admit they were missing a child.  It caused the police to really dislike them because we had found the toddlers in unsafe situations.\n\nIn the 1990s I began working for the county. They were beginning to act very paranoid. One of my offices was right by the Fort Harrison Hotel parking garage.  My one story building was constantly under surveillance from someone with binoculars  on an upper floor of the garage.\n\nI\u2019ve heard some rumors lately that they had some of their people buy a large strip mall in Belleair Bluffs.",

Landlord said the house was vacant because the previous tenant was a young woman who joined scientology and gave them all her assets. Then she changed her mind and basically ran away in the middle of the night.\n\nThe scientology a-holes were looking for her and harassed my bro &amp; SIL for a while. It started with phone calls, then visits. They would try to threaten my bro, saying, \"You'll regret it if you're hiding her. Tell us where she is!\" Each time they would say they don't know her, don't know where she went or how to get in touch with her. \n\nThen one day about 20 of them came &amp; surrounded the house. They had bats &amp; hockey sticks and started banging on the house and chanting \"Send (bang) her (bang) out (bang)!\" They did it over and over and over.\n\nMy brother's dog flipped out and hurt herself trying to jump out the window. My bro grabbed his own baseball bat, ran out and chased them screaming that he was going to kill them. Apparently that convinced them and they never came back.\n\nBro did call the cops, but it was an unincorporated section of Clearwater. The county sheriff\u2019s office handled calls instead of local police and they took forever to get there. \n\nTl;Dr - scientologists harassed my brother about the previous renter before him who ran away from the cult",

One day some big scandal will break and, just like with Weinstein and Chinese censorship, finally the public will do a \"THEY DID WHAT?!\" turn to give this open secret the attention and urgency it deserves.\n\nIt's one of the most dangerous, wealthy, and horrifyingly powerful cults in the world yet it only ever seems to get our attention every now and again. Tom Cruise and  other celebrities that endorses it should be given every bit as much shit as LeBron is getting for China right now. Anyone that willing pulls people into this cult should.",

Flabbergasted, I asked what possessed him to engage with people like that and only then did I learn he was COMPLETELY ignorant of Scientology. He had never heard of them before nor did the name of the cult stick with him at the time.\n\nHe said he had been feeling a little depressed after his flight and these nice people came up to him and spoke to him and the \"advice\" they gave him sounded solid. He bought a few of their books and took the free reading they offered.\n\nAfter learning this I took great pains to describe in detail what the Scientology scam was and very carefully made sure he understood how close he came to being ensnared in their bullshit.\n\nMy father is neither an idiot nor gullible, but he has a blind spot when it comes to shills like Tony Robbins and it was clear he thought of Scientology at the time as not much different than any other motivational speaker.",

The old retreat especially is a huge property with a ton of buildings.  In this area, all of this would have cost them a fortune.  I know they had plans for both.  I had heard a Canadian headaquarters for one, a Narcanon (or whatever they call it) facility for the other.   Both have sat empty for over 10 years at this point. So they will buy property and do nothing with it.\n\nThey tried to buy another property in another township and actually got told to piss off.

Scientology owns 60 properties in Pinellas County under its name. 72 percent of them are tax exempt for religious purposes. The \\~100 properties that we reported were bought by LLCs \\*controlled\\* by members of Scientology are on the tax rolls, not tax exempt. But if the owners don't do anything with the properties, just let them sit vacant as many of them are now, there is no economic benefit to the community.",

So children receive the same auditing (spiritual counseling) as adults. These auditing sessions are more like interrogations about secrets you are keeping that you have to confess in order to progress up the spiritual bridge. These auditing sessions often delve into sexual transgressions. So kids are asked about masturbation, fantasies, sex experiences. If they are victims of abuse, that is discussed too. But abusers are never reported to law enforcement because it is a \"high crime\" in Scientology to report a Scientologist to police. So abuser is not reported and victim is not given help. More on this to come in our reporting.\n\nEdit: Also former members have created the Aftermath Foundation to help people trying to leave Scientology and get on their feet and acclimate to life after Scientology.",

They put the fingerprint on a bomb threat and mailed it to themselves. She was actually indicted for this crime. Tony Ortega, a longtime Scientology writer, wrote a fantastic book about Cooper's ordeal and her work - it's called The Unbreakable Miss Lovely - it's absolutely unbelievable",

How can we at least get them to start paying taxes like an organization instead of using religion to hide away from them?",

They are looking for something to believe in and they find a theology that works for them. The difference with Scientology is that it has a totalitarian hold on its followers in extraordinary ways. Lawrence Wright, in his phenomenal book Going Clear, explains the way Scientology uses celebrities for its benefit. It all started with founder L Ron Hubbard and his desire to gain legitimacy. But Scientology has undeniable control over these members. During auditing, members are interrogated about their secrets and their past behaviors. Auditors write these confessions down, keep them in folders indefinitely. Scientology has been accused over the decades for using this information as blackmail. Wright in his book describes some accounts from former members who believe Scientology is using information in Cruise and Travolta's folders to prevent them from leaving.",

The responses they gave us are in the story - and their responses are what helped us confirm the way these purchases went down. They all went down very similarly. Many not on the market, a broker who was a Scientologist approached with an offer. Paid in cash. Lots of other interesting details in the story.",

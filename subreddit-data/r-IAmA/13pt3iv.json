It's really good to emphasise that it's a great way to practice self-love, and nothing to be ashamed about. Also though, if your kid tells you to stop talking about it, then respect their boundary ;) I have a few podcast episodes on how to talk to kids about sex - find them on The Authentic Sex podcast with Juliet Allen",

I support xconfessions and porn alike but I\u2019m not usually watching porn as I always got disgusted by what I saw on pornhub and all the free sites out there, so for me imagination\u2019s been big. My partner consumes porn on a regular basis, and I\u2019m really not cool about it, although ofc he\u2019s free to do what he enjoys. \nHow can I better accept him consuming porn as his only source for masturbation? Any advice? \n(I try to be free minded but in the end I feel super conservative and insecure. Like I used to think if my partner(s) masturbate with porn our sex is not sufficiently satisfying and it\u2019s kind of a betrayal, which is a very limiting thought and I know masturbation is sth personal. Still would like to get some help on that to work on my thoughts/belief, to not be that bothered by his source for masturbation)",

Begin with an honest and open conversation with your partner. It may feel uncomfortable at first but it's important that you let them know how you feel about it. \n\nExplain how you're not initiating the conversation in order for them to stop doing it, but to understand the reasons why they do so in order not to jump into conclusions that aren't necessarily true. This will most likely help you create a more healthy relationship with them and understand their point of view better.",

And no, not selfish to desire time in solitude making love to yourself - own that's something you value and prioritise in your life :)",

I recommend getting rid of any vibrating sex toys - these may have desensitised your vulva. Take a break for now and begin exploring with you hand or a crystal pleasure wand instead. I assure you that you can regain the sensitivity you once felt, it just may take time. Have you ever given yourself a yoni massage? Or received one from a practitioner? This is a beautiful practice that takes the focus off the 'end goal' of orgasm, and instead moves toward self-love and re-sensitisation of your vulva.",

As u/LuvbitesByDrTara says, no pattern needed as long as it feels and does you good.\n\nIf you want to add some creativity while masturbating, we recommend you don't necessarily focus your attention on the genitalia. There are parts of your body you'd be surprised to find erogenous, so explore it with your own hands, caress yourself and play with different levels of pressure depending on what feels good to you. \n\nIf you want to know even more, we're leaving [here](https://lustcinema.com/series/sex-education) a series from another streaming platform of ours (Lust Cinema)  called Sex School where we explain different ways to explore your sexuality in a healthy and open-minded way. \n\nHope it helps!",

They love watching each other get off while looking into each other's eyes.who  \n\n\\- Merc\u00e8 and Cristian: They love each other, but they also love enjoying their sexuality in their private spaces. Merc\u00e8 loves to masturbate with her trusty vibrator, while Cristian enjoys watching Merc\u00e8's porn movies. \n\n\\- Jake &amp; Dillon: They love doing their kind of masturbation, where nipple play is super important.\n\n\\- Kris &amp; Nikki: Kristen loves it when Nikki tells her what to do. They do it right until the end. Kristen enjoys this moment of not making any decisions and enjoying pleasure while following their lead...\n\nSome of the learnings are that masturbation can help you become more comfortable with your body and sexual preferences. By exploring your desires and needs, you can communicate more effectively with your partner about what you enjoy and want to try in the bedroom. It can improve your sexual self-awareness, enhance your sexual experiences with your partner, and help maintain a healthy sexual relationship. \n\nGo check it out for free and let us know what you think!",

The general rule of thumb is to play with the whole vulva, then lick the clit consistently and take verbal cues to if she says slower or faster.

I can't really do it on my own, I constantly need instructions and it really puts my mood down because I feel like I'm never good at it.\nIs this common? What can we do?\n\n**Second one)**\nShe doesn't masturbate on her own, she says it hurts her sometimes. Also, I cannot put my fingers inside of her, just the bare minimum, not inside-inside. If I do cunnilungus with my fingers (barely inside her) it works wonders, she reaches climax super easy, but if I don't it takes ages. She says she has a trauma with fingers inside of her, because of the pain she felt once on a vaginal examination with that device (cant remember the name).\nAnything she can do to get used, and enjoy, having her/my fingers inside her? I've been trying to do it gradually but I can tell she's not really comfortable with it.\n\nThank you!",

And they fall into apathy and despair. So I have reasons for hope. I will share them quickly. One is the energy, commitment, and determination of young people and they are empowered to take action in programs like Roots &amp; Shoots. Secondly, the human brain. We have this extraordinary weapon. We are finally beginning to use it to create clean green energy and find a new way of interacting with the environment and live in harmony with the other creatures. It's very strange, in fact the most intellectual creature to ever walk the planet is destroying it's only home. And I believe there's a disconnect between a clever brain and the human heart and compassion. Only when the head and heart work in harmony can we reach our true human potential. And this, I believe, is to come. From the resilience of nature, we can help to once again support life. Animals are on the very brink of extinction and we have to give them another chance. Next there is social media, which as we all know can spew out a lot of rubbish and misinformation. But, used in the right way, it means that for the first time in human history, we can bring people to together around the world who all care about a particular issue like climate change so that there can be hundreds, thousands, millions, eventually billions of people all raising their voices and demanding change so that we can make a big difference and politicians will have two listen and will have to make change. And finally, the human spirit. People who tackle what seems impossible and never give up. It's so important to realize that every single one of us has that same indomitable spirit. We just have to nurture it and let it grow to make a bigger impact for good.",

                    "comment": "When I flew over the national park in the early '90s and looked down, I was utterly shocked. What had been stretching to the West Coast was now a tiny island surrounded by completely bare fields. People too poor to buy food from elsewhere. And struggling to survive. That is when it hit me. If we don't improve the lives of these people, there is no way we can conserve the chimpanzees. And that led to the Jane Goodall Institute program. We went not as a bunch of arrogant white people telling the villagers what to do to make their lives better, but with a hand-picked team sitting down, listening to the villagers, and asking them what they thought we could do to improve their lives. And that led to a very holistic program, which gradually grew and we could introduce new ways of helping. This paid off handsomely. The people in the villages are now our partners, helping us in conservation efforts. They've agreed to have a buffer between their villagers and the park to protect the chimpanzees. And the national Park, which was completely isolated, is now gradually being linked to other groups. And this program is now in 52 villages in the Gombe area, and it's in five other countries. And it is making a huge difference. Positive in introducing the youth program reaching the villages. It's probably the most important way in which we are able to conserve chimpanzee habitats. And I'll add to that, I would say we have placed great emphasis on education, helping them stay in school beyond puberty. We do this because it's been shown all around the globe that we all improve as women's education improves. One of our problems today is a growing number of humans. As our numbers grow, there are impacts and finite resources leading to more and more poverty and hunger.",

And everybody laughed at me, how could I do that, Africa is so far away. In World War II we had very little money. I was simply a girl. They told me girl students cannot do that. But I had a wonderful mother who had supported my love of animals ever since I was born, and she said to me if you really want to do this, then you're going to have to work very hard and take advantage of opportunity. That's the message I take to young people all around the world today, especially to those in under served communities. I came to study chimpanzees because of  the paleontologist Louis Leakey who wanted somebody to go with him and study them -- he believed we shared a common ancestor 6 million years ago and that we could learn from their behavior what early humans might have been like. When I discovered that chimpanzees make and use tools, and that they have complex emotions and a sort of \"culture\" no one wanted to believe me. When I went to get my Phd, there was a lot of push back. But I knew this was true - so I kept going. ",

For months, they would run away in fear of her, but after a time they came to realize that she posed no danger to them. The chimpanzee, David Grey-Beard was the first to become relaxed around her after exploring her campsite.\n\nFor Philippa: Dr. Goodall does not have any pets of her own because she travels over 300 days a year and thinks it wouldn't be fair to an animal to leave them alone for that long. Her family has two dogs however, and she is always around animals whenever she travels, so she is never alone!\n\nThank you for your questions!!",

Because up until the mid-'60s, it was actually thought that there was a difference in humans and the rest of the animal kingdom. And it was the work coming in, the early work, showing in how many ways the very biological system DNA and so forth that really changed. The other thing I hope to be remembered for is creating an environmental humanitarian program for people with Roots &amp; Shoots, which is now in 100 countries. It involves members from preschool, kindergarten, universities, and everything in between. Its main message is every single one of us can make a difference. And make a difference every single day. Each group chooses themselves to help animals and wanting to help the environment. To educate young people to be better students, all the conservation work and other organizations to could benefit. And we've gone so far as destroying the planet, so the main hope is that the other people will grow up and do better than we've done.",

When it comes to what we eat, there is growing evidence that as more and more people and countries around the world eat more and more meat, this is not only involving tremendous cruelty to all the animals, but it's also having the most appalling effect on the environment. People don't always realize this. For one thing, areas of the world have been cleared to grow grain to feed the animals. And massive fossil fuel is used to take the grains to the animals and to slaughter the animals. Huge amounts of water, which is becoming increasingly scarce around the world. Huge amounts are wasted changing vegetables to animal protein. And finally, these animals, like us as well, food goes in one end and comes out the other. They belch as well as pass gas. Nothing is second most, it is very, very lethal. Of course, this is all leading to climate change and other great -- it is the greatest environmental issue facing our planet. One thing that is very, very helpful is to eat less meat or become a vegetarian or a vegan. ",

My lecturer at university has put forward the case for democratic representation for future generations. He argues that they deserve equally to have rights that ought put an end to our actions that are going to fundamentally damage their lives. It is incredibly refreshing to hear of your attitude towards our current environmental crisis. We need more environmental scientists and conservationists to represent the ideal we need to adopt in order to prevent the deterioration of our natural world, particularly at democratic level. \n\nLink to paper on future generations: \nhttp://www.greenhousethinktank.org/uploads/4/8/3/2/48324387/guardians_inside_final.pdf\n\nThank you for doing this AMA, it's very enlightening.

The program has just recently been introduced into it's 100th country and continues to grow everyday. \n\nSome advice she gives to everyone who asks though, is that you must think and act locally. Focus on issues in your own community. Map out any potentially hazardous areas (polluted rivers, beaches, parks) and gather support from there. If everyone were to focus on their local communities, then the impact would eventually be global.  \n\nThanks for your question! ",

                            "comment": "Curious: I've noticed over my many years of being a passionate dog owner, that the best communication is a developed mix of our human signals and verbage, as well as dog communication. Because we have effectively co-evolved with dogs for tens of thousands of years, they are capable of reading our own facial expressions and of course, come to understand our tone/voice communications. The concept of actual words themselves may be irrelevant, but the principal is the same behind both. In my early days of training, I relied heavily on vocal commands, but slowly began to realize that a substantial amount of communication between humans and dogs can be done through facial expressions and subtle movements alone. As my own dogs learn about my communication (tonal/verbal, facial, body language), I in turn learn a substantial amount of their own (also tonal, facial, and body language). In some cases there are signals that dogs use (such as panting when happy, or \"sneezing\" when playing to communicate a playful attitude) that when incorporated into our \"vocabulary\" further expands the detailed communication (and understanding) between both humans and dogs.\n\nAs I began to explore this relationship, I noticed that many of those signals that dogs use (such as the examples above) are something that even unfamiliar dogs seem to universally understand. For example, when I meet a new dog, I always use the obvious human signals: a wide smile, happy expression, friendly voice) but I also incorporate some of those dog-signals. In the case of friendly panting, I've noticed that this has a profound effect with dogs that are at first somewhat unsure of you, and this doesn't seem to be limited by the age of the dog. If I give a light panting sound, the dog may initially flip its ears back in surprise, but very quickly accepts the gesture as it would from another dog, and the reactions are consistently positive. In most cases, they will be far more inclined to approach or instigate play or bond-building forms of affection. Likewise, when I am playing tug of war, for example, as dogs do, some sneezing and growling can be incorporated, and again the results have been very consistent: I am usually met with a strong tail wag and more intensified playing. \n\nIt's been a VERY fascinating ten years or so that I've been just sort of playing around with this information and learning quite a bit. I've always had a good standing with dogs, but since exploring this, that has only increased dramatically. It becomes very easy to instigate play and a friendly relationship with dogs.\n\n\nThat being said, I'm curious what you think about incorporating something similar with primates. Undoubtedly, someone  such as yourself is extremely experienced and understands a great deal of their own communication. It makes me curious to learn what sort of non-verbal (or hand-signed) communication is available to both humans and primates that can effectively be applied back and forth, blending our communication into a mold that incorporates both species and signals that both can understand. Much of this takes time and familiarity between individuals, but there also seem to be (at least in the case of dogs) some forms of expression that are easily understood even without personal familiarity.\n\nThoughts?",

And because science has now opened its mind to the possibility of intelligence in creatures, we are learning so much more and it's a very exciting time.",

I don't understand how people could think any farm animal doesn't understand death or get upset when their farm companion goes away for slaughter. And past farm animals how people even think/thought hunting game isn't capable of intellectual though. Personally, I think all animals have some level of consciousness and conscious though about themselves along with a wide level of emotions. Thinking only humans are capable of these things shows humans tend to forget that they are animals all the same.",

In Gombe we have witnessed acts that could be considered altruistic on various occasions. One example being when an orphaned 3 1/2 year old chimp, without older siblings (whom sometimes adopt their younger siblings) was taken in by an adolescent male around 12 years old. The older male allowed the orphaned chimp to follow him around (even making sure he kept up while they were on the move), allowing the orphan to cling to his underbelly when the orphan was scared and/or cold, and even allowing the orphaned chimp to sleep in the same 'night nest' as him. This is especially interesting considering that the adolescent male was not related to the orphaned chimp in the least.\n\nThanks for the question!",

I have two questions related to your statements on the safety of GMOs.\n\nWhy do you reject the safety of GMOs when the consensus for their safety is arguably higher than that of the statement that global warming is primarily caused by human activity? (This consensus was studied by the Pew Research Center last year and the results can be read [here](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/12/05/many-americans-are-skeptical-about-scientific-research-on-climate-and-gm-foods/).)\n\nOn a related note, do you believe it is appropriate for scientists to comment or speculate on fields outside of their expertise? The real danger is that without expert knowledge one may very likely be wrong, but since you are a well-known and well-respected scientist in your own field, laymen will nevertheless trust your opinion, even if it is wrong. This phenomenon is also not limited to your own statements; there are other popular figures in STEM-fields who are often accused of making public statements outside of their field of expertise (e.g., Dawkins, Musk, etc.).\n\n(edit: grammar and spelling for clarification)",

            "comment": "Dear Dr Goodall,\n\nThank you for everything you do for the natural world and humanity, and for being such an inspiration and role model. I have two questions:\n\n1) I often hear that a measure of the intelligence of a species is the brain mass to body mass ratio. However, I find this to be somewhat flawed because: a) Not all of the brain is dedicated to carrying out bodily functions, indeed some parts of the brain are dedicated to emotion, or communication; b) Body complexity does not necessarily increase as body mass increases, and partly for this reason I find it doubtful that there is a linear relationship between body mass and the brain mass required to manage that body; c) There seems to be no such correlation within the human species, indeed there is a large range of body sizes in the human species and we could easily find two people with very different brain mass to body mass ratios but with the same level of intelligence. So my question is: Do you believe the brain mass to body mass ratio is a good measure of the intelligence of a species, and do you have a better/more refined measure?\n\n2) My second question is about evolution. Homo Sapiens are descended from, say, Homo Heidelbergensis. I believe it is fairly clear that this evolution did not happen in one go; that is, over many years individual changes occurred whose accumulation led to a new species. But where do we draw the line between Homo Sapien and Homo Heidelbergensis? The very notion of species suggests (incorrectly?) that evolution is a discrete process and not continuous. We have many Homo Sapien fossils, and many Homo Heidelbergensis fossils, but we rarely hear of anything in between. So my question is: Is there some aspect of evolution that ensures evolution happens in \u201cjumps\u201d which leads to the clear idea of having different species? Or, is evolution a continuous process and there is no objective place to draw the line between species? In which case, why do we not find fossils to represent this continuous process?\n\nThank you :)",

To me they seem as if represent the violent and peaceful sides of human nature. Anyway, I was wondering if you have any insight into the behavior of Bonobos and Chimps and what that may tell us of our own behavior? \n\n",

One question I have, I apologize if this is too personal, but the photographer long time friend who photographs you, in the documentary he makes the comment he thought you were the prettiest girl he'd ever seen or something like that.  And he said \"surely they won't put that in there\" but they did include it!  Did you know this?  \n\nIf you could do it all over again, would you do things the same or differently?  \n\nTake care!!!

And IMHO, the idea that anthropomorphism helps us recognize animal intelligence is false-if anything it hinders us. A recent study pointed out that one of the main causes of ape intelligence being underestimated, was that people anthropomorphized non-human primates and expected them to show intelligence in the same ways as humans.

Is there any possible chance you remember being at a Ted conference in Monterey, California in about 2003, where a large member of the front desk ran into you, and said he was a big monkey, while apologizing? When I said that, I hadn't seen you, and didn't realize I was saying it to *the* Jane Goodall. It's a funny story I tell my friends all the time, and I always had wondered if you remembered it, although there is no reason you would, and it would be highly unlikely. Just curious, keep on and be well. Thank you.",

I right now am an intern at a zoo in my hometown and get to work with seven chimpanzees, all of whom have very vivacious personalities and are extremely complicated and intelligent. I am in awe everyday of them and truly appreciate the wonderful opportunity I have been given to work with them. Without you and your work, no one would know just how intelligent and emotionally complex these animals are. You were a trailblazer- you were one of the first to stop considering animals as inferior beings, and realize that they have the capacity to be just like us and perhaps even more so. As someone who wants to do just that-- help bridge the gap between how we view humans and non-human animals-- my question to you is what was it like to be one of the first? What was it like going out on your own to a foreign continent? Was it scary, were there times you wanted to quit, and how did you overcome those moments of self doubt? Any advice for a young girl about to go out on her own and how to get started and make a difference in a world so big? Thanks for your time and for inspiring me everyday.",

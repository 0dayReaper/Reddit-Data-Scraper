I\u2019ll be taking your questions for half an hour starting at about 4:30 ET.\n\nProof it's me: https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/240903767350968320\n\nWe're running early and will get started soon.\n\nUPDATE: Hey everybody - this is barack. Just finished a great rally in Charlottesville, and am looking forward to your questions. At the top, I do want to say that our thoughts and prayers are with folks who are dealing with Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf, and to let them know that we are going to be coordinating with state and local officials to make sure that we give families everything they need to recover.\n\nVerification photo: http://i.imgur.com/oz0a7.jpg\n\nLAST UPDATE: I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run. AND REMEMBER TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER - if you need to know how to register, go to http://gottaregister.com.

            "comment": "Here is a collection of all the questions and answers:\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mnkw)\n&gt;I am recent law school graduate. Despite graduating from a top school, I find myself unemployed with a large student loan debt burden. While I'm sure my immediate prospects will improve in time, it's difficult to be optimistic about the future knowing that my ability to live a productive life -- to have a fulfilling career, to buy a house, to someday raise a family -- is hampered by my debt and the bleak economic outlook for young people. I know that I'm not alone in feeling this way. Many of us are demoralized. Your 2008 campaign was successful in large part due to the efforts of younger demographics. We worked for you, we campaigned for you, and we turned out in record numbers to vote for you. What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;I understand how tough it is out there for recent grads. You're right - your long term prospects are great, but that doesn't help in the short term. Obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young people at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill, you can stay on your parent's plan until you're twenty six. Because of our student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young people have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that's why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don't be discouraged - we didn't get into this fix overnight, and we won't get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mom8)\n&gt;What's the recipe for the White House's beer?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;It will be out soon! I can tell from first hand experience, it is tasty.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mnz9)\n&gt;What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;Money has always been a factor in politics, but we are seeing something new in the no-holds barred flow of seven and eight figure checks, most undisclosed, into super-PACs; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmg8)\n&gt;What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014. But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm2v)\n&gt;What is the first thing you'll do on November 7th, win or lose?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;Win or lose, I'll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60ml11)\n&gt;How are you going help small businesses in 2013 and 2014? and what if any bills are you going to implement for small businesses, in 2013, and 2014?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;We've really focused on this since I came into office - 18 tax cuts for small business, easier funding from the SBA. Going forward, I want to keep taxes low for the 98 percent of small businesses that have $250,000 or less in income, make it easier for small business to access financing, and expand their opportunities to export. And we will be implementing the Jobs Act bill that I signed that will make it easier for startups to access crowd-funding and reduce their tax burden at the start-up stage.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm5n)\n&gt;Who's your favourite Basketball player?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;Jordan - I'm a Bulls guy.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mlwx)\n&gt;We know how Republicans feel about protecting Internet Freedom. Is Internet Freedom an issue you'd push to add to the Democratic Party's 2012 platform?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm41)\n&gt;Are you considering increasing funds to the space program?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmaf)\n&gt;How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS?\n\nAnswer:\n&gt;It's hard - truthfully the main thing other than work is just making sure that I'm spending enough time with michelle and the girls. The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I'm in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run.

The way our voting system works today means that only those with the most money get their voice heard, and those who can't pander to the large spenders will not.  The only way to truly fix the election system is for PUBLICLY FUNDED ELECTIONS.  Elections should not be about who is best at gathering money, but who has the opinions and goals that he people want, these two are not, and should not be one in the same.  ANY donation should be considered a bribe.  All candidates should get EQUAL air time, all candidates should get EQUAL money to spend as they will on advertisements and their campaign, all candidates should have an EQUAL chance to be heard across the nation, regardless of how rich they are, or their friends.  The only way to have a true representative democracy is through a system like this.  Until this happens money will always influence elections in a way that is NOT beneficial to the people.  How can the people EVER trust their government knowing they are constantly taking bribes from the wealthy.  Fix this ONE issue and 90% of the other issues about corruption will slowly fade away.  I implore you, PLEASE do something about this!  Simply creating some minor law about capping donations and such is simply not enough.\n\nI don't know if you will even see this as this conversation is already over, but one can only hope...",

Do you realize just how many presidential candidates there are? There is a nice little list [here](http://www.politics1.com/p2012.htm). In terms of advertising, if we assume that the total time advertisements are shown stays the same, that leaves next to no time for any individual candidate. To reform this, how would you solve the problem? Only give funding to certain parties candidates? That would be even worse that our current system. And that is saying something, because our current system is awful. This idea works in theory the same way our current system does.",

The point you bring up is an extremely good one, and absolutely must he addressed in a very clear way for people to have faith in this sort of system, but fortunately that work was done by those who went before us. \n\nNow, I'm not a political science if civics expert so I don't claim to know what all of the solutions which have been tried are, not which were more successful. I can say that the one system I know of for publicly funded elections involves a sort of primary system but not (as primaries would also have to be publicly funded else the bribery would just happen there). It essentially is that (to use a small example of a gubernatorial race) a candidate would have to prove that they have a significant amount of support in whatever jurisdiction they are running (in my example a state) to justify getting public monies. So for example there is an election to be held in North Dakota for governor and there are 15 people who wish to run. These people, by whatever deadline happens to be chosen, would be required to gather 5% of the voting populations signatures (% can be adjusted however the citizens choose) from each district in the jurisdiction, in this case 5% from each county in ND. Now that is the voting population, so it is 5% of the total number of voters in the previous governors election (even if there are 5 million citizens but only 500,000 voted, they would only need 25,000 signatures). This demonstrates that there is enough citizen support for that person to be a serious candidate without setting the bar so high that only the major parties can clear it. \n\nNow that works in state and local elections, because the total number of signatures and amount if ground is limited so no huge sum if money must be spent to gather the signatures. But it wouldn't work for presidential elections because it would still cost many 10's of millions to get that many signatures from every state in the nation. So on that I don't know specifically what a national system may look like, I do know they exist in most countries but I haven't read enough to know the details. ",

His answer was the same populist \"We are going to hold the embargo to spread democracy and freedom\" bullshit thats been said by every president to uphold the criminal embargo, including McCain. \n\nThe embargo does nothing but hurt Cuba and its citizens by restricting beneficiary trade, and even much needed medical supplies that Cuba needs. Its been consecutively voted against by the UN by a vote of ~192-2 (being the US and Israel).\n\nThe mere fact that the Obama thinks that the US has the power to decide another country's well being on the guise of \"spreading democracy\", I think is quite telling, and why I much more prefer Ron Paul's views on American foreign policy. The US prior to the Cuban Revolution had supported the Batista dictatorship, as US investors had much stake in Cuban land. The embargo was hence initiated to protect American interests by immediately thwarting and disabling its socialist neighbor before it ever even had the chance. Later the CIA tried to overthrow Castro with multiple assassination attempts and an invasion, while decades later still aiding anti-Castro militants. The Cuban Five still remained jailed. Politicians like Obama have made such simple historical facts and opinions seem controversial and radical.\n\nHere is Amnesty's report on the impact of the embargo\nhttp://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR25/007/2009/en/51469f8b-73f8-47a2-a5bd-f839adf50488/amr250072009eng.pdf\n\n\n",

                    "comment": "First of all, before I answer this question, I want you to know my credentials, such as they are.  I am a third year law student.  I am also a supporter of Marijuana reform.  I even got busted for felony possession w/intent to deliver a few years ago.  I also am heavily involved in politics, and run an organization that hosts events where paid speakers talk about issues of the day.  Earlier this year, our organization invited Drug Policy legal expert, Alex Kreit, to come talk about Marijuana and the Law.  I asked him the question that you are attempting to ask President Obama.  I will now paraphrase what he told us:\n\nObama does not have the amount of control over local federal authorities that your questions presupposes.  Obama *did* promise that he wouldn't interfere with individual state decisions on medical use of cannabis.  In fact, after being elected, his administration (specifically, Eric Holder, I believe) published the Ogden Memo (Google it).  This memo basically directed local federal authorities to respect the states with medical marijuana laws, and not prosecute anyone as long as they are not in violation of the state medical marijuana laws.  *However*, local federal authorities ignored the Ogden memo, and there was not much the Obama administration could do about it.  The way Alex Kreit put it was to say there are not many \"levers to pull\" for the Obama administration, and that the positions that the local federal authorities hold (U.S. Attorneys, for example) were specifically designed so as to maintain independence from central control.\n\nBasically, as a result of all this, it's not really accurate to blame Obama for the fact that local federal authorities are shutting down dispensaries and arresting people.",

                            "comment": "Alex Kreit here.  Someone just let me know about this thread.  Thanks for the plug.  Just wanted to clarify that my comments were specifically about the ability of the Obama admin to try to encourage compliance with the Ogden memo.  Rob Mikos has published a fairly thorough &lt;a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1768127\"&gt;law review article&lt;/a&gt; that discusses this issue and explains why the Ogden memo did not really provide any protection. \n\nThat said, it is also important to recognize that Obama could have done other things on this issue but hasn't.  For example, Obama could have picked better appointees--particularly to head the DEA.  He chose extremist drug warrior and Bush holdover Michele Leonhart for the job.  As some may remember, this summer Leonhart refused to admit that heroin and crack are more dangerous than marijuana.  Obama certainly could have made a better pick for the position.  He could have asked prospective nominees point-blank if they would honor the Ogden memo.  Instead, by nominating Leonhart, he all but guaranteed that the Ogden memo would be ignored by the DEA.  I think that the willingness of US Attorneys to ignore the Ogden memo also speaks poorly to them as appointees.  I think a fair US Attorney would have tried to honor Ogden's memo in good faith, even if he or she wasn't obligated to follow it.  Clearly, many of them simply ignored it.  Obama's administration could also have supported one or more of the congressional proposals to protect state medical marijuana laws.  To my knowledge, they've done nothing to back these proposals.  The list could go on.  \n\nSo, are President Obama and Eric Holder spearheading a coordinated strategy against medical marijuana?  I don't think there's any evidence of that.  I believe people who think otherwise may not have a full understanding of the relationship between the DOJ in DC and local federal law enforcement (again, Rob Mikos discusses this relationship in his excellent article.)  My best guess is that Holder genuinely hoped people would comply with the Ogden memo.  I imagine that Obama himself has probably given this issue hardly any attention (certainly he seems to do everything he can to avoid talking or thinking about this issue based on the lengths he goes to to ignore drug policy questions in public forums.)  But, are Obama appointees like Michele Leonhart and local US Attorneys cracking down on medical marijuana?  Obviously they are.  And, if Obama had nominated people who agreed with the Ogden memo in the first place, then there would never have been an issue about compelling compliance with it.    \n\nAnyway, those are only brief thoughts--it's impossible to convey all the nuances in an internet comments thread.  :)  But, I figured I would chime in to clarify the referenced comments of mine a bit.

The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I'm in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner.

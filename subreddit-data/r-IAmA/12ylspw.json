These models work by predicting the most likely next word or sequence of words based on patterns observed in the training data.   \r  \n\r  \nHowever, because the training data is often sourced from a wide variety of texts, some of which may contain inaccuracies, contradictions, or fictional content, the model may generate text that includes factual errors or information that is not grounded in reality.  \r \r  \n\r  \nIn other words, the model may generate text that is plausible and coherent based on the patterns it has learned, but that is not necessarily factually accurate or consistent with the real world. It is important to keep in mind that large language models are not capable of true understanding or knowledge, but rather rely on statistical patterns to generate text. As a result, they may produce text that is incomplete, misleading, or outright false, and it is up to humans to critically evaluate and verify the information they generate.",

But on the other hand, there's also a lot of concern about the negative impact AI could have.  \n\r  \nSo how do we make sure that the benefits of AI outweigh the risks? It starts with being mindful of how we develop and use AI. That means making sure that we're building systems that are transparent, explainable, and accountable. It also means being proactive about identifying and mitigating potential risks - for example, by investing in research on the safety and security of AI, and by establishing ethical frameworks and standards for AI development and deployment.  \n\r  \nAnd that\u2019s why there have been *a number of* times that we\u2019ve decided not to do a project \u2013 simply because the potential good did not outweigh the bad.",

But the intuition behind math, being able to work and understand the formulas and basic concepts around statistical rigor is hugely important.\n\nWhen you are working in machine learning, you are basically doing modern applied statistics. Having a good grasp of statistics and the maths involved is kind of a requirement. When developing good models (even when you are not building the architecture yourself and simply importing a library), understanding the maths behind the errors function you are optimizing, knowing the advantages/disadvantages around that function and your model type is absolutely incredibly important. Especially once things go wrong with your model - And eventually it will but you might not even notice and understand why without the math knowledge.   \n \nTechnology alone wont help since you simply dont know what you dont know.\n\nI dont want to gatekeep that field. But one really shouldnt trivialize the requirements for it. Similarly, you cant just say \"For everyone who isnt good at reading, dont write off the possibility to be a lawyer. Just go and do it. The laws are in the books and use them to help you!\". In the end, you will be working with data and numbers pretty much full time and one should be really comfortable with it and enjoy doing that.",

This impact can vary depending on the field, but we can often compare projects to determine which will have the greatest impact. \r  \n\r\r\r  \nSecond, we always partner with an organization that has subject matter expertise related to the problem we are trying to solve. This helps us better understand the problem and identify the best AI solutions. \r  \n\r\r\r  \nThird, we assess whether we have access to the necessary data and whether AI is a feasible solution for the problem at hand. This involves a thorough analysis of the data and the problem to determine if AI can offer a meaningful solution. \r  \n\r\r\r  \nFinally, we make sure that the partner organization is equipped to use and leverage the AI solution we develop. We work closely with them to ensure a successful knowledge transfer and to enable them to continue using the AI solution after our involvement ends. \r \r  \n\r  \nOverall, our decision-making process for choosing which problems to solve with AI involves considering impact, partnering with subject matter experts, assessing data and feasibility, and ensuring successful knowledge transfer. By following these steps, we can determine which projects are most likely to benefit from AI and demonstrate the difference it can make.",

Note that this is a rough estimate and does not take into account irregularities in the car's shape or the arrangement of the Skittles.\r  \n\r  \nThe 1996 Honda Accord DX has an interior passenger volume of approximately 100 cubic feet (2.83 cubic meters). \r  \n\r  \nThe volume of a single Skittle is approximately 0.001 cubic feet (2.83 x 10\\^-5 cubic meters). This is calculated by assuming that a Skittle is a cylinder with a diameter of about 0.5 inches (1.27 cm) and a height of about 0.4 inches (1.016 cm). The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = \u03c0r\\^2h, where V is volume, r is the radius, and h is the height.\r  \n\r  \nNow, we can divide the total interior volume by the volume of a single Skittle to estimate how many Skittles can fit inside the car:\r  \n\r  \nTotal Skittles = Interior Volume / Single Skittle Volume\r  \nTotal Skittles \u2248 (2.83 cubic meters) / (2.83 x 10\\^-5 cubic meters)\r  \nTotal Skittles \u2248 100,000\r  \n\r  \nSo, you could fit approximately 100,000 Skittles in the interior of a 1996 Honda Accord DX.

For fun:\n\nCylinder is clearly a pretty bad choice for estimating skittle volume. They also ignore packing ratio. Also, the volume for a cylinder with a diameter of 0.5 in and height of 0.4 in is 0.000045 cubic ft, not 0.001 cubic ft (like 100x smaller than it \"calculated\"?)\n\nI would take a geometric average along each dimension (so cubed root of diameter^2 * height), use that to calculate a volume assuming a sphere, and assume a packing factor. \n\nVolume in cubic feet: 0.0000303 ft^3\n\nPacking factor for random spheres: 0.635 (theoretical maximum is 0.74 for FCC sphere packing)\n\nTotal Skittles = V{interior}/V{skittle}*Packing = 2,095,650\n\nSo, about 2.1 million.",

That is the \u201closer,\u201d and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd.

I work at the University for Peace in Costa Rica and we are exploring alternative ways of using data and A.I. to work on peace, conflict and data literacy. Could you share some insights/ideas on how can we use data, storytelling, machine learning and statistical modeling for policy building and/or to create a real impact in the real world?   \nOr, rephrasing this a little differently, in a world where everyone is pushing towards A.I., how do you see a possible use of A.I. for peacebuilding and consensus-making?",

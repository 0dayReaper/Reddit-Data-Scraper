    "postText": "Update: It doesn't look like a vote is going to take place today, but this fight isn't over\u2014 Congress could still sneak an expansion of mass surveillance into law this week. We have to keep the pressure on.\n------------\nUpdate 2: That's a wrap! Thanks for your questions and for your help in the fight to rein in government spying powers.\n------------\n\nA mass surveillance law is set to expire on December 31, and we need to make sure Congress seizes the opportunity to reform it.  Sadly, however, some members of Congress actually want to expand the authority. We need to make sure their proposals do not become law. \n \nUnder Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the National Security Agency operates at least two spying programs, PRISM and Upstream, which threaten our privacy and violate our Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nThe surveillance permitted under Section 702 sweeps up emails, instant messages, video chats, and phone calls, and stores them in databases that we estimate include over one billion communications. While Section 702 ostensibly allows the government to target foreigners for surveillance, based on some estimates, roughly half of these files contain information about a U.S. citizen or resident, which the government can sift through without a warrant for purposes that have nothing to do with protecting our country from foreign threats.\n \nSome in Congress would rather extend the law as is, or make it even worse. We need to make clear to our lawmakers that we\u2019re expecting them to rein government\u2019s worst and most harmful spying powers.

Help them understand, and help them *help others* to understand, too. \n\nIt's not the only tool in our kit, as technology is increasingly promising new ways to entirely remove from governments the ability to violate certain rights when they prove to be poor stewards of them (for example, strong escrow-free encryption by default as a guarantor of a certain level of privacy), but it should always be our first.",

Your call might be answered, but it will be a month after the vote already occurred, and the vote won't go the way it should.\n\n2. 100\n\nSince my senator and congress person both have responded to my letters I write in....but in the responses they just try to lecture me why I'm wrong and they are right, there is little I can do to effect any change or influence.  \n\nThe senator Cory Gardner in particular is a turd.  He has told me how he is pro life and supports shuttering Planned parenthood and outlawing abortion.  \n\nHe also supports dismantling the CFPB even after I wrote him and gave him 3 explicit examples along with real documentation showing how this organization saved my credit and also saved me thousands of dollars due to an error the bank in question actually caused, but tried to stick on me.  \n\nHe thinks undoing CFPB regulations, and saving banks money by using bank-selected arbitrators is better for ME personally.  Rather than the bank having to worry about being sued collectively if they decide to take unethical actions.  He says this like its a fact.  Ridiculous.\n\nThe things I've written to my \"representative\" person have largely went unanswered.  I've heard him speak and frankly he's an idiot.  I don't believe he even fully understands the issues at hand, and I don't think I could have an intelligent conversation with him about the issue anyway.\n\nBasically I've learned that they are set in their path, and the people that are in their face the most waving credit cards and business influence get preference.  You can tell them you disagree, but they will just argue their (set in concrete) side of it and send you away.\n\nThese are actually issues that don't have an \"opinion\", they have a clear right and wrong, and these people side on the \"wrong\" far too often.",

How did that go?\n\nMost Americans don't like the tax plan. That's before a lot of people were made aware of provision that roll back key parts of the aca and personal security. It was just passed hours ago. \n\nIt's not like we've been pussy-footing around, either. It is well documented that millions of Americans called and wrote their reps, including me. I got a stock response, both call and letter, that basically amounted to: \"I don't give a shit. - your rep -\" while only putting in, marginally, more effort. I only have so much time and energy to call and write my senators (Richard Burr, Tom Tillis, Rep. David Rouzer, none of whom I voted for) to defend basic human rights that I should not have to worry about getting taken away. Frankly, I'm getting exhausted just wondering what it's going to be next month.\n\nI know I'm coming across as being angry at you. I hope that you believe me when I say that is not my intention. I'm just sick and tired of people saying we should contact our reps and that is somehow supposed to help. They don't give a shit, and it pisses me the fuck off these days when someone insinuates that they do.",

Password managers (unique passwords), end-to-end encryption, the Tor Browser, and Signal.\n\n*edit:* [The ACLU is reporting the vote has definitely been put off for now](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/943627259486920704) due to the backlash, but we'll have to fight this again soon enough. Thank you to everyone who put in a call. For those who haven't, please keep the pressure up! You can make a call here: https://www.aclu.org/issues/tell-congress-stop-spying-without-warrant",

Any comment on the revelation that Intel have a co-processor on their x86/64 cpus together with a pre-emptive multi-tasking operating system - Minix OS that includes a tcp/ip network stack?  [source](http://www.zdnet.com/article/minix-intels-hidden-in-chip-operating-system/)\n\nSuch a device would, in theory, be highly capable of low-level interception and could probably even scan and hook kernel in-memory data structures. For example irq vectors for keyboard logging, or watching or writing raw ethernet/tcp-ip frames, or even kernel or app level ssl apis.  \n\nIs it known whether intelligence services use or intend to use such  capabilities? What could an average user do to defend against this kind of ring -2 hardware supervision.\n",

You need to step back and see how all of the parts fit together.\n\nHere are a couple of underreported stories from the last few years that would concern most people, but they might have missed:\n\n* https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/us/politics/att-helped-nsa-spy-on-an-array-of-internet-traffic.html\n\n* http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/nsa-examines-social-networks-of-us-citizens.html\n\n* https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/us/nsa-collecting-millions-of-faces-from-web-images.html\n\n* https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/gchq-nsa-webcam-images-internet-yahoo\n\nA great two-part series on XKEYSCORE, which is what I used at NSA to actually look at the full internet activity history of my targets based on their IP:\n\n* https://theintercept.com/2015/07/01/nsas-google-worlds-private-communications/\n\n* https://theintercept.com/2015/07/02/look-under-hood-xkeyscore/\n\nAnd my personal favorite, the NSA spying on radicals' pornography viewing habits for the purpose of leaking it to discredit them:\n\n* https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/nsa-porn-muslims_n_4346128.html\n\nBut I think the scariest thing to consider is that it is, in the opinion of the Congress -- though it has never been fully established as constitutional by the supreme court -- that the NSA can \"ingest\" into its surveillance systems **without a warrant** any communication that is only \"one end domestic.' \n\nThe government claims they aren't \"targeting\" Americans under 702, but also state that if you get swept up in the dragnet and your comms somehow end up as results on an analyst's query, at that point, the NSA and FBI start considering your private records under a new legal status, calling them \"incidentally collected.\" These \"incidentally collected\" communications of Americans can then be kept and searched at any time, without a warrant. Does that sound right to you? Senator Wyden calls these well-known shenanigans the \"backdoor search loophole,\" and although there have been efforts by the House of Representatives to reform this abuse, the bill Congressional leaders are trying to sneak through right now intentionally *leaves it open* for continued exploitation.\n\nThat \"one end domestic\" collection authority (Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act) is the power they're trying to expand right now, and they'll succeed at it unless they get flooded with calls before the vote, which could happen in just hours.\n\nIf you're looking for the number for your representatives, here's the ACLU's easy-mode link: https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/tell-congress-stop-spying-without-warrant?redirect=Call-ReformSection702",

More on this here: https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/government-abusing-its-surveillance-powers-dont\n\nI worry that such flexibility in the hands of the government will allow them to spy on critics, activists, and minority communities, as our government has done in the past",

                    "comment": "Both authorities pose significant threats to privacy. FISA, and specifically Section 702 of FISA, raises serious concerns. The government uses Section 702 to warrantlessly monitor Americans' international (and even domestic) emails, web-browsing, and phone calls with the assistance of companies like Facebook, Google, AT&amp;T, and Verizon. It carries out this mass surveillance on U.S. soil, including both \"PRISM\" and \"Upstream,\" which were revealed by Ed Snowden. Section 702 surveillance results in the collection of hundreds of millions of Internet communications each year -- and that number doesn't include all of the communications that the government copies and searches through in the course of Upstream surveillance. You can read more about Section 702 surveillance [here](https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/we-must-rein-president-trumps-spying-powers).\n\nExecutive Order 12333 is also a significant threat to privacy. The scale of the government's collection under EO 12333 is mind-boggling -- it's the primary authority under which the NSA conducts surveillance, and it's not overseen by the courts at all. Much of this spying occurs outside the United States, but Americans' communications are of course sent, routed, and stored abroad, where they're vacuumed up in the NSA's dragnets. A few examples that I highlighted in response to another question: the government has used EO 12333 to record every single cell phone call in, into, and out of at least two countries; collect hundreds of millions of contact lists and address books from personal email and instant messaging accounts; acquire hundreds of millions of text messages each day; and collect nearly 5 billion records per day on the locations of cell phones around the world.

Data collection is one thing, but how actionable is the information being collected? Also, if actionable, is there a 'half-life' to the data? Could the government build a case against every single citizen on the off chance they need to take action against us?\n\nFor example, say I admit to a murder, or communicate plans for a massive drug deal, share government secrets, look-up information on bomb-making, etc. All of those things I *assume* will get me added to a review list of sorts, but wouldn't my constitutional rights protect me? Or are these government agencies free to cherry pick information as 'evidence', review further, and eventually detain me under the grounds of suspicion... \n\nPeople of course will say 'just be a good lad and you won't need to worry!', but given the circumstances and the amount of data they're collecting, taken out of context, it seems like they could conceivably turn every citizen into a criminal if they wanted. \n\n",

In addition to the ACLU, there are plenty of organizations working on privacy and surveillance issues around the world -- as just a couple of examples, check out (http://www.inclo.net/) and (https://www.privacyinternational.org/). Finally, if you're in Europe, the European Commission has a great deal of leverage over U.S. surveillance reform through the Privacy Shield agreement, which you can read more about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7l3e02/congress_is_trying_to_sneak_an_expansion_of_mass/drj9u18/).",

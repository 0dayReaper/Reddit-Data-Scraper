    "postText": "My name is Anthony Sanders, an attorney with the Institute for Justice. and I just released my book [Baby Ninth Amendments: How Americans Embraced Unenumerated Rights and Why It Matters](https://ij.org/books/baby-ninth-amendments-how-americans-embraced-unenumerated-rights-and-why-it-matters/) available for purchase or **free** download.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nListing every right that a constitution should protect is hard. American constitution drafters often list a few famous rights such as freedom of speech, protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and free exercise of religion, plus a handful of others. But there are an infinite number of rights a constitution could protect. However many rights are put in a constitution, others are going to be left out. So what is a constitution drafter to do? Luckily, early in American history a few drafters found an easier way: an \u201cetcetera clause.\u201d It states that there are other rights beyond those specifically listed. The most famous etcetera clause is the Ninth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states: \u201cThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\u201d Yet scholars are divided on whether the Ninth Amendment itself actually does protect unenumerated rights, and the Supreme Court has almost entirely ignored it. Regardless of what the Ninth Amendment means, however, things are much clearer when it comes to state constitutions. Two-thirds of state constitutions have equivalent provisions, or \u201cBaby Ninth Amendments,\u201d worded similarly to the Ninth Amendment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis book is the story of how the \u201cBaby Ninths\u201d came to be, what they mean, and what they tell us about unenumerated rights more generally. Unlike the controversy surrounding the Ninth Amendment, the meaning of the Baby Ninths is straightforward: they protect individual rights that are not otherwise enumerated. They are an \u201cetcetera, etcetera\u201d at the end of a bill of rights. This book argues that state judges should do their duty and live up to their own constitutions to protect the rights \u201cretained by the people\u201d that these \u201cetcetera clauses\u201d are designed to guarantee. The fact that Americans have adopted these provisions so many times in so many states demonstrates that unenumerated rights are not only protected by state constitutions, but that they are popular. Unenumerated rights are not a weird exception to American constitutional law. They are at the center of it. We should start treating constitutions accordingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe book can be found either at the [publisher\u2019s website](https://www.press.umich.edu/12676756) (U of Michigan Press) or [at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0472076159/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt can be downloaded for free from this link: [https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.12676756](https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/ww72bd75z). And it\u2019s available for free for Kindle on the Amazon page as well. More generally you can find me at [my profile page](https://ij.org/staff/asanders/) at IJ or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/IJSanders).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAsk me anything about my new book, my work at the Institute for Justice to educate the public about the proper role of judges in enforcing constitutional limits on the size and scope of government, and my work litigating constitutional cases to protect economic liberty, private property, freedom of speech and other individual liberties in both federal and state courts across the country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will begin answering questions at 10:00am EST. Verification can be found [here](https://twitter.com/IJ).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Thank you for all the questions! Signing off for now, but may log back in later in the day to answer some more.",

But the provisions I write about, Baby Ninth Amendments, are\u2014I argue\u2014referring to natural rights that we have as people that we \u201cretain\u201d after we come together in a society that are not otherwise listed in that constitution. Examples I give in the book are a right to earn a living, a right to choose a school for your child, a right to garden, a right to choose what you want to eat, and a right to collect stamps. These are just a few of the literally infinite number of ways you can exercise your liberty. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean the government cannot regulate these rights at all. It just means they\u2019re protected and the government needs a good reason to regulate them just like it does of enumerated rights.",

While the Courts have never brightly defined how to determine if an interest is compelling, the concept generally refers to something necessary or crucial, as opposed to something merely preferred. Examples include national security, preserving the lives of a large number of individuals, and not violating explicit constitutional protections.\n\n&gt;* be narrowly tailored to achieve that goal or interest. If the government action encompasses too much (overbroad) or fails to address essential aspects of the compelling interest, then the rule is not considered narrowly tailored.\n\n&gt;* be the least restrictive means for achieving that interest: there must not be a less restrictive way to effectively achieve the compelling government interest. The test will be met even if there is another method that is equally the least restrictive. Some legal scholars consider this \"least restrictive means\" requirement part of being narrowly tailored, but the Court generally evaluates it separately.",

Schools should be forced to tell parents when their children are making large changes like this. The school has no right to keep secrets from parents. Parents are the ones responsible for raising their children into adulthood and trying to tell parents that the school can keep secrets from them is not a winning battle. This is groomer like behavior. While it obviously isn\u2019t grooming in every single case, this is behavior typical of adults who are up preying on children. There should be no secrets between children and other adults in cases of such important issues. \n\nNone of this is persecution. They aren\u2019t being arrested or having rights taken away from them that other people enjoy. Children don\u2019t belong at drag shows, you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to make permanent changes to your body until you\u2019re an adult, and schools shouldn\u2019t be hiding things from parents. \n\nSo please explain to me how you justify this as persecution?",

It\u2019s saying the list of rights in the constitution isn\u2019t an exclusive list and other rights they may have forgotten to mention can be added by the courts as appropriate. For example lawmakers may not explicitly outline your right to collect stamps, or choose where to go to school, or where to work, but you have that right even if it isn\u2019t explicitly laid out. Many of them are implied as extensions or practical applications of other rights.\n\nIt is true they can be much less firmly protected than enumerated rights because they aren\u2019t explicit, and most of these rights should be enumerated. With that said having these clauses allows for the judiciary to protect rights that should be but just haven\u2019t been considered yet because real life situations change as society does but the written law tends to lag behind.

A gallon was legal, so the court thought the difference was arbitrary. I also really like the case Thiede v. Town of Scandia Valley (Minnesota 1944) which recognized the right to establish a home.

So when I went to compile my simple list above I started with a list of all 50 states that I found online, and then simply put a mark next to the ones without such laws.\n\nI then double-checked myself by counting the ones that were unmarked (I marked the ones that *didn't* have such laws because there were fewer of them), and got 34... But you had said 33. So then I triple-checked by counting them up in your actual book, and got 33.\n\nI then re-did the counting 2 or 3 times on both lists and kept getting 34 on mine, 33 on yours, and that REALLY confused me.. So I started going through one at a time to see where the discrepancy was. I don't remember if that's when I marked ones that *do* have such laws, or if I just went through name-by-name to see when I got out of sync.\n\nEither way, that's when I ran into the fact that I had an extra state on my list that wasn't even in your list.. And at first I thought maybe I doubled it up, but no, Kentucky was in the correct place alphabetically, and was indeed missing from your list. That's when I briefly doubted my own sanity and went to make sure Kentucky really was a state, and that the list I pulled from the Internet was correct.\n\nIt was, so I went ahead and posted my list and brought attention to the fact that Kentucky was missing. I assume that it was either mistakenly left out, or that you had forgotten where you were along the transdimensional probability axis that determines which parallel Universe you're currently in. Who knows, maybe you're more familiar with a history that includes Kentucky being irradiated during what we consider to be the 'Cold War'.",

So I guess if I go from Oklahoma to Idaho to get an abortion.\n\nEven saying that, it wouldn't happen. You have the whole state sovereignty issue, which the current court seems to be crafting decisions supporting it, you have crandal v nevada, saenez v nevada which started this thread about having the right to travel. Baring that you have the dormant commerce clause which the current court seems to be whittling away at it which gives states more autonomy.\n\nI suppose anything is possible, but really, I don't see how the person I responded to can make an argument that Women don't have the right to travel to other states.\n\nThat person is basically trying to make the implication that without the ERA women have no rights, and while that's certainly a spin, I'm not sure there are a lot of lawyers or courts that would agree with that position.",

It's going to pass in other states soon for even beyond minors. Many state legislatures only meet every 2 years so there's several red states that havent had sessions since the Dobbs decision. Plus there are already states with laws allowing civil lawsuits against out of state individuals who help anyone get an abortion from that state. Whether any of this will be enforced is another matter but the expense of litigation or defending yourself from a felony and possibly an appeal process that could be 5 years start to finish is enough to ruin your life. So that is why these will all be implemented because it will deter many good samaritans regardless of ultimate legality.",

Now, having said that, I'm willing to believe that the person I responded to legitimately believes that states have passed laws preventing women from traveling to them, and if that's the case, you're right, it isn't hyperbole. It's just a patently wrong\n\nAgain, what states have passed laws that have prevented women from traveling? The answer is none of them have passed a law baring travel on the basis of sex.\n\nPeople say all sorts of shit for the press, until they actually pass a law, or a law moves out of the legislature and is ready for a governor to sign, it is still an assumption.\n\nI would liken that posters statement akin to republicans making the claim that Democrats want to take their guns.",

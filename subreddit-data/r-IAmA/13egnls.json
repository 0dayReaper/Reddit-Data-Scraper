Our platform is helping to digitize one of the least digitized industries, making it faster, more efficient, and more sustainable than ever before. Join us for an AMA to discover how we're revolutionizing the building industry, and ask us anything about what's next for BIMobject!\n\nA quick intro: \nSophie - Hey everyone! I'm the research lead at bimobject. I've been here for 3 years and spend most of my time trying to make the platform better and easier to use for our users. \n\nJoakim - the Swiss Army Knife of BIMobject.com! Joakim's done it all - from design and strategy to user interviews. With a background in design, he's the mastermind behind our stunning revamp a few years back. \n\nBen - the man who started it all - the Co-\nfounder of BIMobject.com! With a background in architecture (and still practicing on the side), he has worn many hats over the years. Recently, he's been on a mission to get up close and personal with our AEC users, understanding their challenges and how BIMobject can make their work lives easier. \n\nThanks for taking the time to join our AMA!\n\nEdit: We have to sign off for this afternoon (European working hours) but we will check back in first thing tomorrow for any more questions you might have! Thank you to everyone who participated :) \n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/uxM7LYj)!",

The manufacture's objects we provide on the BIMobject marketplace offer comprehensive geometric representations and relevant product data, from basic representations to intricate models with specific attributes. The level of detail and information the objects we provide on the BIMobject Market Place should always align with the LOD requirements specified for each project, ensuring accurate and reliable data throughout the BIM process. There is room for improvement in this area so the content on BIMobject better aligns with the project's LOD goals.  \n\n\nAs I mentioned in another answer, we are about to start development on a Revit Add-in. The add-in will allow us to offer functionality that can help add more information to objects during the entire project. Please let me know if you have any feedback or would like to be part of the beta testers group.",

The industry is generally very resistant to change (it is after all the second least digitized industry, only agriculture beats it), and with fewer people willing to adopt it there is a general lack of awareness of how it can be used. It also requires a bit of training.\n\nWe are hoping for faster adoption in the future as more and more countries bring out policies requiring the use of BIM in new construction. I think given the resistance to change we may only see widespread adoption when companies have no option but to use it in their projects.",

Who is responsible to conform the design to applicable codes and standards? Who is responsible for changes? Do you build from the model or the plans? When there are issues with the model, who is liable? Who needs to make the change? Who is responsible for plan review and approval?\n\nIt requires highly sophisticated parties to negotiate a fair agreement. It requires highly sophisticated practitioners to perform the design and modeling work. It takes a high level of tradesmanship to interpret the model and build it. It takes a sophisticated GC to control quality and verify compliant installations. It requires a lot of investment to get e-devices in the hands of the tradesmen.\n\nThat just doesn't exist in the industry outside of major national or regional owners, designers, or contractors.",

We still have construction documents (paper/PDF) as the contract docs, but I guess the contractor just trusts us enough to use the model for fabrication and clash detection. It works out well for large complex buildings with lots of client vendor supplied equipment.",

An example would be having the HVAC subcontractor model their ductwork, equipment etc in Revit, same with electrical, plumbing, structure, sprinkler etc. When you bring all the models together in the same space you can run a clash detection  that looks for where these systems are in conflict, an example would be say a piece of ductwork running through a steel beam. Doing this way out ahead means you can be more accurate in ordering and fabricating material, less time lost due to finding these clashes in the field and having to rip out existing work to come up with a fix, not staying this no longer happens but hopefully it's less common. The sustainability benefit in my opinion is really in the form of reduced waste through better up front planning.",

            "comment": "I've been out of the industry a while, but I distinctly recall how much of a pain it was for my drafting team to put together a decent library when we first started using Revit.\n\nI have a three areas I'm curious to hear your opinion on.\n\nFirst: you refer to yourselves as a marketplace. Am I to understand that your business model is the creation / collation of BIM objects at a number of LoDs with some kind of library or individual model access fee, in the same vogue as Standards Australia with building codes? If so, how do you plan to ensure equity in access for small to medium enterprises, which make up the majority of the industry and are often cash-flow sensitive?\n\nSecond: most manufacturers for key equipment (particularly in mechanical services) offer their own BIM objects on-demand, typically at no cost, though with varying degrees of difficulty (mostly time-related) to retrieve. How do you interface with the Daikins, Siemens, and Carriers of the world to promote BIM uptake and ease of use? Are there issues with different regional standards for modelling and varieties of equipment?\n\nThird: rather open-ended one here. We all know the industry is generally slow to change, as skills acquisition for both management and modelling staff is time consuming and expensive, culture notwithstanding. BIM is the future, and I always felt like we were miles behind where we should have been; the collaborative digital lego approach to engineering was just... frustratingly delayed and inaccessible. What changes do you think need to be prioritised in the BIM status quo (libraries, software development, standards, management approaches, tiered UIs, whatever) to accelerate uptake?\n\nAs an additional aside: to what extent do you guys work with autodesk and other software providers to integrate your offerings with their platforms? Are you pursuing embedded plugins and such?",

It's a marketplace in the sense that we have brought together many different manufacturers into one place, so you can easily find what you're looking for.\n\n2. We currently have an ongoing initiative where we are restructuring our product information database which means that we will later enable much more granular filtering for architects and engineers to help them meet the specific requirements for their projects. This is something we believe will save time and make it easier to adapt to whatever regional standards a user is working with.\n\n3. We've seen more adoption in the last few years, particularly moving from 2D to 3D designs, which often leads to BIM adoption. This of course doesn't encompass everything that BIM is about but is a start. I think there is still a lack of knowledge of the full capabilities of BIM and how it can be used. It could be that stakeholders need to be nudged more and feel that there are greater benefits to using BIM early on. For example being able to do preliminary climate declarations to meet requirements and  avoid later delays in the construction phase. One way to nudge them and help the industry is to encourage shared ownership of a project. We have heard that it's becoming more and more common to design a building using IPD (Integrated Project Delivery). A collaborative approach where all stakeholders take shared ownership of the project. Of course there are many other things that need to change but this is one of the main areas we would like to see progress further. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for your last aside, we are about to start developing a Revit add-in in June :)",

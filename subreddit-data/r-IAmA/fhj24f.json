Should we not have understood this would have gone global when it infected an entire province of china with a metropolitan area of 60+ million people?",

The problem is, if you deny too much, and are caught unprepared, panic sets in. I think we've been gutting our global health institutions for too long. In rich countries like the USA, we now take public health for granted. We don't have that gut-churning fear our grandparents used to have when Polio and other disease raged through the population. This, hopefully, could be a wakeup call for us to spend the necessary money to reinforce our public-global health networks.

My favorite chapter was the downed pilot who survived in the marshes talking to her, possibly fictional, guide over the radio.\n\nMy question, how accurate do you think you captured the reactions of different countries?  Are there any corrections or additions you would make?\n\nFor example, I think in light of recent events, multinational criticism and blame would be a new dimension to talk about in World War Z, although I think you went for a more optimistic ending.",

If seen through the right lens, I think Minecraft has the potential to teach kids the kind of mental survival skills they're going to need for the world we live in. \n\nAs far as the right course of action for a quarantine: I think we need to act on what the actionable intel teaches us. Right now, in the USA, we are getting sucker-punched because we didn't have enough test-kits ready to go. We can't counter the virus if we don't know where it is. Proper testing, like they are doing in South Korea would not only help us get a handle on how to effectively respond, it would also do so much to reduce the anxiety we are all feeling right now. The best way to stop mass panic is to get a clear picture of the situation.",

For example, in \"Devolution\", I had to physically make the weapons my characters make with the materials and tools available just to make sure that it's possible.",

I\u2019ve read it a few times, and after I lost my mom, I was living alone, in a cabin, like a bug out place, going nuts, dealing with some heavy PTSD. The idea of zombie apocalypses kept me focused on something, as absurd as it was, it gave me a framework. Now the place is stocked and everyone is turning to me for advice with corona. The audio book was insanely well done, and the best voice acting \u2014-changing narrator by chapter\u2014-amazing. \n\nUsed to travel by car for 3 hour trips to practice with 3 linemen. Best way to pass time was designing our \u201cachievable\u201d dream houses (250k) for zombie defense. \n\nDo you have a dream house design?\n\nThanks again.",

Keyword: round. \n\nHonestly, the truth about zombie prep is that it should really be common sense disaster prep. I don't think anyone should hole up in a bunker somewhere. The best way to get through any crisis, personal or societal, is with the help of other people. We're social animals. We need each other.",

It seems like some countries right now are doing better than others, and people have gone into panic mode, not paying attention to the facts.  Should something more deadly spread, or if this gets worse, do you think we'll be able to handle it on an international level or will we fail to properly combat the virus?\n\nI'm also curious as to how your writing process differed on devolution compared to world war z.  It seems like world war z may have required a lot more research, I imagine, and so how did you find writing a book which is even more fictitious and not really based on a real life threat such as a virus?  \n\nThanks Max!",

Back then (in the 1920s-30s), having pandemics regularly kill or cripple millions of people was just part of life. We've come such a long way. Even now, we've got armies, literally, of dedicated public health professionals fighting this world war. We can do our part to help them. That's why, in WWZ, there's no one hero. Everyone has a role to play. Just like now. No matter what country you're in, check in with your local public health department. Check in with WHO. Follow the guidelines. Do what you can, from social distancing to hygiene, to help slow the spread. This is so solvable, as long as we all do our part.",

A lot of people warned me that working with kids would be impossible but I really found it to be a total joy. It makes sense that a generation of kids that self-documents is actually pretty comfortable on camera. And kids are ready to act naturally and be themselves if you give them permission to just *be* and don't freak them out by making them feel like they have to *be in a movie*. Hope that answers your question.",

It took me a long time to realize that I'd been real the whole time, and the thing that I am pursuing was the thing I was pursuing doing theater in sixth grade. Do you write? You're a writer. Do you act? You're an actor. I'd say don't wait to get some arbitrary version of success or attention for you to believe that you are doing the thing. You really can start enjoying it right away. You don't have to wait to be good. The process of doing it is the process of becoming better not being good. I am now looking at your question and realizing you never asked for advice. Am I psychotic? Perhaps!",

But in this scene I felt so proud of her, so hopeful that she could continue to draw on this strength.\n\nOthers here can't wait to see the movie. I feel as strongly my sense of anticipation at the chance to go tonight to see it again.

            "comment": "Hey Bo! First off, I have to say that you are truly an inspiration to me for a multitude of reasons. So thank you for pouring yourself into your craft and for not conforming to anyone's style. Eighth Grade is truly revolutionary and Its easy to tell, once again, that you have really drawn from your own personal feelings to help send it along. And the fire scene in the backyard got the waterworks flowing, knowing I have often asked myself those same questions and not gotten resolution to them. That was excellent, as was the entirety of Elsie's performance. \n\nA concept you breached with a throwaway line on the what. CD was the idea of Parasocial relationships, the whole idea that consumers feel like they know a performer or that they're friends with them when in reality they will probably never interact. It almost seemed as if Kayla was trapped in some sort of paradox where she was subjected to a parasocial relationship with the people she actually interacted with on an everyday basis. That could be baseless but it's something I chewed on after the first viewing. PSI is such an interesting concept as a fan, but how do you deal with it? Maybe not just PSI but just fandom in general. Do you ever feel constrained, especially now as your fame grows? \n\nSemi-related follow up question: Do you accept fan mail? Hope that's not off putting. Just wanted to thank you in a more formal and personal way without it looking like I'm blowing smoke.\n\nEdit: Holy shit I can't believe I got gold! Especially before Mayonnaise guy! Thank you anonymous citizen! What I can believe is the incredible responses we got from Bo. You're the best! ",

                    "comment": "Wow thank you for the kind words, truly. I think you make a great point about Kayla treating the people in her life parasocially. That was a sort of huge realization for me when I made MAKE HAPPY (my last netflix special). I had thought for a long time that my anxieties and issues were completely connected to my specific circumstance in life - being a young comedian *literally* performing for a *literal* audience. But as I talked about what I was going through on stage, I would talk to people after the show who said they felt like I did. Even though they didn't have an audience and weren't literally performing. And I realized that the sort of shitty, meta problems I was having as a D-list celebrity had been democratized and given to an entire generation. Now EVERYONE gets to feel like their own publicists with their own brands, navigating the world with the sort of Proper Noun version of their own name. And that realization directly lead to the movie. Me realizing that my problems and worries were NOT my own. And that a 13 year old girl was honestly going through something just as deep and interesting as I was. If I was being honest with myself, I didn't want to believe my problems were shared. I wanted my anxiety to be unrelatable. But it wasn't. I was not unique. Which was a bummer. But I also wasn't alone -- which saved me and helped me immensely. So I feel constrained and weirded out in the way I'm sure anyone does who feels similarly to me. But speaking it out loud helps. This was long and rambly and apologies if there are spelling/grammar mistakes. And I don't really have a place to send actual mail but you can hit me up in instagram DMs or on twitter. I try to read things but it gets hard. Be well.",

Your job is just to serve the person on camera which is a very good thing to learn for directing films. And also with specials, you're trying to set ONE LOOK that can be filmed for an hour, so you try to be as versatile and simple as possible visually -- so that helps with a film to learn the skill of getting as much out of a location as possible.",

We have an interesting idea for a commercial in which models hold the mayo in their hands without the jars, and you seem like a good candidate for that. We\u2019ve done extensive research to conclude that your hands are an estimated 9.1 inches long from your scaphoid to the distal phalanx of your middle finger. With that, you must be able to hold tons of our mayonnaise, which is a nice contrast to the children who have signed up to model. May we ask, how much would you say you\u2019re able to hold? Just as an estimate, if you want to do so yourself then be our guest, but keep it at about room temperature (68-77\u00b0F/20-25\u00b0C). If you could get back to us soon, as you didn\u2019t reply to the email, that\u2019d be fantastic. Thank you!\nArnold Haley\nRaif\u2019s Wholesome Mayo\n669-221-6251",

OMG, I grabbed my daughter and held her hand (yes, in the theater and she was all like, geez, Mom, but she didn't pull away, either), and I cried because my baby girl is the coolest, the smartest, most beautiful, most incredible girl in the world. And then I reached out on FB to the girls I went to eighth grade with and thanked them for sharing all that awkwardness with me so many years ago.\n\nThanks, Bo, for the gift of this film.",

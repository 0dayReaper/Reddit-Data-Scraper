Rather than answering as many questions in the time allotted to you (in this case, apparently 12 questions in about 30 minutes), consider this thread an ongoing conversation with the people. \n\nESPECIALLY consider answering questions that may not garner a popular reaction, or questions that are clearly hostile in nature. It\u2019s easy to answer softball questions like \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite book\u201d, but it doesn\u2019t show much in the way of gumption.",

In fact, a resolution I brought the Senate floor with Senators Lee and Murphy called for ending in the war in Yemen. That war is an unbelievable and horrific humanitarian disaster. That country is facing a cholera epidemic and widespread famine. We should not be allied with a dictatorship like Saudi Arabia who is leading the effort in that war. Further, in my view, that war is unconstitutional because Congress, which has the war-making authority in our form of government, has not authorized it. Let\u2019s get out of Yemen as soon as possible and help bring humanitarian help to that struggling country.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a brutal dictatorship which does not tolerate dissent, which treats women as third class citizens and which is run by a handful of multi-billionaires. I strongly condemn Trump\u2019s affection for the rulers of Saudi Arabia, and if we are to avoid a never ending war in that part of the world, it is imperative that we develop an even-handed policy toward Iran and Saudi Arabia.

President Trump himself echoed this logic when asked about the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, claiming that the Saudis are spending \u201c$110 billion\u201d on military equipment. A former lobbyist for the arms manufacturer Raytheon leads Mr. Pompeo\u2019s legislative affairs staff.  \n\n\n&gt;The relationship between Iran and the Houthis has only strengthened with the intensification of the war. The war is creating the very problem the administration claims to want to solve. The conflict between Saudi-led forces and the Houthi insurgents had helped Al Qaeda and the Islamic State\u2019s Yemen branch \u201cdeepen their inroads across much of the country.\u201d \n\n---  \n\n&gt;American engagement there has not been authorized by Congress, and is therefore unconstitutional.  \n\n&gt;1. the war is a strategic and moral disaster for the United States. \n&gt;2. the time is long overdue for Congress to reassert authority over matters of war.\n\n&gt;[Senate Joint Resolution 54](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/54) calls on the president to withdraw from the Saudi-led war in Yemen.  \n\n&gt;**The Senate voted 55 to 44 to delay consideration of the resolution. Next month, I intend to bring that resolution back to the floor.**   \n\n&gt;The brutal murder of Mr. Khashoggi demands that we make clear that United States support for Saudi Arabia is not unconditional. Human lives are worth more than profits for arms manufacturers.  \n\n-Bernie, [Oct 24^th '18](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/24/opinion/bernie-sanders-saudi-arabia-war-yemen.html)",

Children cannot learn if they\u2019re hungry or homeless or if their families are struggling with drug addiction. Further, we have got to respect educators in this country and make sure that we attract the best and brightest to the teaching profession by paying our teachers good wages and providing them with good working conditions. Unbelievably, in America today, there are states like Oklahoma and Colorado where kids are going to school 4 days a week because of budgetary constraints. How insane is that? Further, we need to move toward universal, affordable childhood pre-K.

Having said that, I strongly believe that we should move toward the legalization of marijuana because that issue is an integral part of our failed criminal justice system. Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country, and there are millions of Americans who have police records because they were arrested for possessing marijuana. And when that happens, it can be harder to get a job or an apartment. If we are serious about criminal justice reform in this country, we must move towards the legalization of marijuana and that is something I\u2019ll fight for.",

The root is that banning this substance goes goes against our nation's belief in individual liberty and the freedom to choose, while of sound mind, what we feel is fine for our own bodies to endure.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo go into a bit more detail  (for those interested):\nAs long as I, of sound mind and the ability to make a rational decision, choose to impact only myself by smoking marijuana, knowing full well what the impacts of that substance are on my body, then it should be 100% legal for me to do so.\n\nThis is the exact same reason alcohol is legal.\n\nNon-prescription addictive drugs should be illegal because they remove a person's ability to make a rational choice and have a high probably of leading to serious addiction and great bodily, relationship, and economic harm to one's self and those around them.\n\nIf a substance temporarily impairs a person to the point of impacting their driving, then there is a valid reason to make it illegal to drive while under the influence.  A car + inebriation can lead to undue harm to others.  Alcohol is legal, but drinking and driving is not.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe ban on marijuana has nothing to do with harm to one's own body, harm to others, or addiction.  It has to do with stigma and the need for people to control others.  If a person believes the stigmatized marijuana to be a dirty past time for dirty people that they consider to be interchangeable with more addictive / destructive drugs like cocaine, heroin, oxy, etc... then they will attempt to persuade others to feel the same way; which means banning them all.  Their belief is based in ignorance, not based on any tangible reasoning.\n\nIf believing this substance should be banned based on the perceived harm it does to one's body.. then what next?  Should we ban all contact sports?  Should we ban marathons?  Fast food?  Soft drinks?\n\nIronically, taxing fast food and soft drinks at higher rates is often considered liberals overstepping, yet meanwhile it's conservatives that are more apt to flat out ban marijuana.  At least liberals are consistent in wanting to tax marijuana sales at a higher rate.  Conservatives just seem to make willy nilly random  decisions about these things based on their own prejudices...",

It is to the point where some countries are granting Americans asylum on humanitarian grounds based on either illegitimate criminal statutes, or disproportionate sentences and inhumane prison (and post-release confinement or supervisory) conditions. \n\nI do not believe it is some charity or like any other political issue to be taken or left on the table. When these actions are done with our taxes and in our name, we are responsible. We cannot speak about the legitimacy of other governments when we commit harm through ours. \n\nIf you or those you stand with and that stand with you actually care for reform and justice as you claim, then you will not limit reform to what may be politically expedient.

I have talked to too many college graduates who are earning 10 or 11 bucks an hour - and that is not acceptable. Further, millions of young people have left school deeply in debt and are struggling hard to pay off those debts. Low wage jobs and high debt makes for a difficult existence. My hope is, that young people in response to these issues will become increasingly involved in the political process and stand up for their rights.

However, my unemployment is now up and I have yet to land a new position. Now I have barely any income on my part (I am married) and a 3 year old son to take care of. The nanny position I took while I am job searching in my field barely pays anything. Do you think it is possible that something could/will be done about the extensions? ",

If Trump and his Republican colleagues can provide a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1% we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free and substantially lower the burden of student debt on millions of Americans.

I know the idea of paying 40+% taxes of your income must seem insane, but hear me out: I am 20, I started working full time in my gap year and I have to pay that amount of taxes, and yeah, it took some getting used to, but our minimum wage is good so earning enough despite tax is not a problem at all. \n\nThe benefits: I never have to worry about getting sick, cause the costs are covered by the state. Not only are there no tuition fees, after turning 18, we actually get paid to study. Around 880usd a month if we live away from home. I never have to worry about getting laid off, cause the state pays if you\u2019re without a job as long as you apply to x amounts of jobs/week. You might think a lot of people try to use the system and then aren\u2019t motivated to work. I haven\u2019t found that to be true at all. Because of our great conditions everyone I know strive to give back to society, they are more motivated to go to work every day. \n\nEdit: this blew up! Thank you kind stranger for the gold, first gold ever so really appreciate it. I\u2019ve been reading all the responses and have tried to respond to as many as I could. \n\nI\u2019d also like to add that of course Denmark isn\u2019t perfect (I personally disagree with our recently more strict immigration policy) and also, I\u2019m by no means an expert on our tax system, it\u2019s a bit more complicated than \u2018just\u2019 40%. Recently there actually has been an issue where some people dealing with the taxes stole a lot of money. I believe we can bounce back. It just comes to show that our model only works if society invests in its people and if people invest in society. ",

In 2016 you engaged a lot of young people who otherwise wouldn't have been.   \n\nIt's my hope that these people stay engaged and become lifelong voters.  Can you think of some things that the the Democratic party could focus on to help achieve that goal?",

The debate over climate change is over. The scientific community is almost 100% united in telling us that climate change is real, caused by human activity, and is already doing devastating harm to our country and the world. We must as a nation lead the world in moving aggressively toward such sustainable energy as wind, solar and geothermal and when we do that, we will not only combat climate change but create millions of good paying jobs and lower electric bills. We must also move toward the electrification of our transportation system and rebuild our crumbling rail system. The United States should lead the world in combating climate change not have a president who rejects science and works with the fossil fuel industry.",

I caucused for you, donated, and spread your message to all willing to listen. I was fortunate enough to attend your rally at the UW campus that year. It was magnificent!\n\nOne of the major reasons I supported you, apart from the obvious stuff (Medicare For All, Decriminalizing Cannabis, reigning in Corporate powers), was the fact that you largely have avoided pushing excessive gun control in your home state of Vermont.\n\nAs a racial minority who genuinely isn't sure whether or not I can trust Law Enforcement to protect me, I strongly believe in the Second Amendment, as well as the ownership of commonly owned rifles. I know \"assault weapons\" are a highly contentious point of political conflict, but I would hope that, as a nation, we could discuss the ramifications of reactionary gun laws and the unintended consequences they may have on the American people.\n\nAs you yourself witnessed during the Civil Rights Era, our laws tend to disproportionately impact specific groups, namely racial minorities and the poor. While I do greatly wish to see action taken to reduce gun violence, I have a hard time imagining how criminalizing the ownership of 50+ year old rifles will improve the already divisive nature of our country. Just like our drug laws, new gun laws will impact racial minorities and the poor before it affects those who *truly are* a threat to community safety.\n\nMy question is this: **What can I do, as a left-leaning liberal gun owner, to better highlight my concerns to a Politician willing to listen?** I've sent countless emails and letters to my local representatives, only to be brushed off as an \"NRA Supporter\" or something similar. I despise the NRA for a variety of reasons, and I'm not here to represent their misguided attempts at being true representatives of the American Rifleman. I want a serious dialogue with serious people who are willing to treat this issue with the respect it deserves.\n\nGun ownership is a right that belongs to ALL American people, and I fear that the polarity on this issue will result in further division when we *should* be coming together.\n\nThanks for the AMA!",

However here in the Bay Area you have, a few times now, endorsed candidates for state office who strongly oppose policies to bring in new high density housing construction. (Specifically Jane Kim and Jovanka Beckles). Job growth has occurred rapidly here but construction of new housing has failed to meet that burden, and the result has been rapidly increasing rents and housing costs, with disastrous results for the working class.\n\nWith your endorsements, you've aligned yourself with candidates who support policies that will exacerbate this scarcity.\n\nWhat is your position on urban housing development, and its role in housing affordability in areas with rapid job growth? Do you support higher residential density in urban areas with low carbon emissions and good public transit? Or should America continue its pattern of suburban sprawl and accompanying auto emissions and habitat loss? If you do support higher density, how do you reconcile that with your endorsements?",

I have deep respect for you and even sat in the Senate gallery to watch you speak my first time in DC. Your work for working class and low-income individuals is renown. \n\nWith that being said, I want to hear your views on a couple issues that I feel that you have misinformed. The first is: I want to know your reply to the argument that a national $15 minimum wage will increase the unemployment rate in economic regions where the equilibrium wage is below $15. More specifically, I want to know how you would combat unemployment due to small businesses, a large part of the suburban and rural American economy, not being able to cover labor costs? \n\nThe second question I have for you is related to my past work in public housing. In many urban areas, there have been calls for rent controls or even limiting the boundaries of urban development to make housing affordable for those with low incomes. However, the result of this policy can lead to slumlords  and blight since the upkeep of an apartment/house above the rent control is not profitable. What is your approach to increase housing affordability and if it includes rent controls, what are you plans to combat blight and landlords that fail to provide and upkeep adequate amenities?",

The two biggest issues, in my opinion, are bipartisanship and allocation of tax dollars. After that I would say it's dishonest campaigning. What would you recommend is the best solution that voters can impose to fix these issues? Seeing as we are constantly told there is no money for fixing our infrastructure, but we are paying tremendous taxes and many politicians have substantial salaries. And many of us want to get more diverse thinkers in Congress but are stuck with candidates that feel they need to vote with their party which is only one side or the other. \n\nI tend to vote democratic.

It was definitely obvious in the rise of Trump but I fear it is equally present in the backlash on the the other side of the proverbial fence. No doubt the removal of Trump from office is a step forward for the evolution of civilisation given the direction it has been progressing throughout recent history. Do you think, however, a step forward is somewhat less of a victory for civilization's progress if it too is driven by the same human tendency for sensationalism or popular trend that enabled Trump to take office in the first place? At what point do we as a people need to step back and figure out why we as so susceptible to getting caught up in the tide of popular opinion in our own demographic? is it simply our nature to follow the herd or do you think we, in collective scenarios, can overcome the tendency and exercise real individual discretion to a point where we are no longer susceptible to social, cultural and all other forms of mass manipulation or conditioning? We saw the same thing after 9-11 even I found my younger self supporting the reaction to the attacks, I dare say if it didn't last so long it is possible I may not have become weary enough to question what now seems like an obvious knee jerk, action-reaction response.\n\n\n2) With wealth distribution becoming ever more biased and polarised, in addition to the environment and the ecosystems that sustain our very existence, being exchanged to the point of near collapse facilitating the generation of said wealth. Do you think we should be concerned that those who plunder for profit are fully aware of the repercussions and simply do not perceive a threat because the wealth they have hoarded will likely insulate them from the catastrophe that awaits around the corner especially for the poorest of humanity.\n\n3rd and finale, do you think as I do that education is of prime importance for real evolution for our global society? How do you imagine a well educated planet would look, where people not only understand political strategy but also understand human nature, our psychology and anthropology, science,  the rules of our reality that poses the power to transform half hazard borrowed opinion into considered, measured and well thought out predictions? Do you think there could be negative effects to having a well educated planet? I.E it may be harder to push political agenda based on ideology or philosophy, perhaps it may be hard generate enough jobs capable satisfying an educated planet as people learn that, without the back breaking labour of person paid far less than any western country would consider minimum wage, there can be no $800 smart phone to generated the billions in profit for the people trying to pay their workforce even less.\n\nThese concerns trouble me greatly, I know I shouldn't concern myself with things out of my ability to control, or even fully understand but I don't believe a single person whom has ever been told \"dont to worry\" or \"you think too much\" or \" don't think too much\" has ever successfully heeded the advice...quite frankly I believe people who do it can't help it, its our nature.",

In 2016 you were the only one with the courage to speak out about medicare for all, raising the minimum wage, publicly funded college, legalizing marijuana, etc.  The most recent national polls show that 70% of Americans now support medicare for all, 66% support legalizing marijuana, 60% support publicly funded college, and many cities and companies have started to raise their minimum wage to $15/hr (for example Seattle and Amazon).  The latest national poll showed approximately 90% of democrats support medicare for all but many of the democratic leadership do not.  My question is with such broad public support, what actions aside from voting are best to make sure our politicians listen to the will of the people and not the big money interests?",

Your Ambassador, Mr. Bailey has done a lot of dirty work in my country during his time here. It's not democratic and friendly to put a country into submission just because the USA and EU say that Russia will come over and threaten the global peace.",

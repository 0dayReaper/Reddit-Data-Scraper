I have over 100k Twitter followers (same handle), work with leaders in tech, finance, and real estate primarily, with some professional athletes for peak mental performance - and have a global base of clients in high stress, highly competitive environments. For example, I did commentary for BBC on Simone Biles when she was struggling with mental performance at the Olympics.I founded the Ultra Successful Newsletter: [https://drgurner.substack.com/](https://drgurner.substack.com/)\u2026and founded the r/ultrasucccessful subreddit community.Private work with me has about a 2 year waitlist.\n\nProof: [here](https://imgur.com/a/BmS4c4F).\n\n\\---\n\nThis post is now closed from answering live questions at 1:00pm ET ",

People who are ultra successful see what is \\*possible\\* and they are not constrained by something I call \"imaginary rules\" that govern the majority of people. \n\nIn athletes, it is not seeing the same physical limitations...and in business, it is not seeing constraints in much the same way. People largely will try for what they believe they are capable of....and if you listen to very elite people (whether Musk or Bezos), you'll hear them speaking of massive things, long before others are believers or see the possibility. This is how it works.",

So many questions but I'll edit down to one.\n\nI left my more traditional career to start a game company, so that i can break free of some of the boxes you get written into as a dev. I have issues finishing my own projects though, which was never a problem when i worked for others. I'm extremely confident in my abilities and decision making, but that confidence seems to evaporate when I'm on my own.\n\nI'm worried that it's not the work that I'm good at, I'm just good at absorbing skills from and surpassing people around me. I don't think of my self as a competitive person but i don't know how else to read the tea leaves. How would you suggest i go about replacing this motivator, and with what?",

Are your goals clear to you, and have you set yourself deadlines? One motivator for when I'm independently relying on myself to achieve for myself, is fear of disappointing myself. No idea if it's an unhealthy suggestion or whatever but goals and deadlines make this very trackable so I can actively work to it. Also telling someone else that I'm going to do something by a certain date will improve the chances of me actually doing it",

When people know that, they usually take the feedback well....otherwise, you look like a jerk. \n\nKeep those principles in mind when you're trying that technique...most CEOs I know really crave direct feedback and don't get enough of it.

Founder CEOs have often done or touched \\*every area\\* of that business at some point earlier in its development - and how they operate is a lot more hands-on (in my experience) generally than corporate CEOs who tend to be more \"orchestra directors\" than hands on.\n\nFounder CEOs tend to take more risk, are less afraid of being untraditional in what they try (take different chances), more resourceful, and seem to be more fluent across areas of the business because of the depth of their knowledge base in those areas of operation.  They're faster to cut, and have less extensive/laborious processes that are red tape, etc..as well that I've seen. In the Corporate CEOs favor, they tend to have a bit more \"people management\" expertise &amp; structure...but not always, and as I said above, they tend to lead more like an orchestra - they can have a bit more trust in their leaders to execute. \n\nThese are just a few areas I've seen as patterns.",

Despite the hype, a surprising number of my clients come from fairly humble beginnings - and that really does stick with them. Of the ones that don't, having a view that is more detached is a bit more common.\n\nThey're often out of touch with more money-related things and common hassles many people face. Many don't fly commercial, for example, or have to worry about food, rent, or paying a bill...they aren't often inconvenienced in the same way. Money solves a lot of hassles and problems...but it doesn't protect you from human concerns - like health of your parent. There are definitely human concerns that cut across income.\n\nBut in my client book, I don't really see people who don't see \"people as people\" - but I acknowledge that it's a self-selected group because those folks likely don't reach out to people like me to begin with. I like to think I get a pretty fantastic and open group of people who are also just highly competitive and looking for an edge to grow and challenge themselves.",

Founder printed money solo for a few years out of college before joining with the CFO (also an entrepreneur) to scale and eventually sell for $100M+. They are very sharp, top notch operators and close friends. The previous CIO had a stake, was let go a few months ago to in part to open the spot for me.\r  \nProblem: I want to position myself to ask for an equity stake. Given the work I've done so far and the trust they've shown in me, it won't be unreasonable to ask (eventually). I think one of my barriers is that I can't \"break into the circle\" because I don't/can't live in their world. To put it frankly, I'm not just not nearly as rich as them and can't get close enough to them. They're not assholes about it, they just live different lives.\r  \nQuestion: What do very high-level operators like that look for in partners? Am I overly concerned with being \"the third amigo\"?\r  \nRelevant bits: We have a small RE side hustle that my wife and I are committed to growing steadily over time. We also have a very small clothing retail biz that's really just meant to pay for a vacation or two.",

I expect myself to perform really well at anything I do and sometimes it gives me anxiety about starting. I've noticed this shows up as over planning without taking action at the end. I recognize these as my faults but somehow I still can't correct or get past it. I refuse to believe that this is how I am and how I am always going to be. Do you have anything that could be helpful for me? I hope my question makes sense",

Some do lose their relationships as well. \n\nThe ones that keep it together, have to make it \\*very intentional\\* - and it is hard. The demands are always there. But I have a number of clients with great marriages - but they are all, without exception, people who made them a priority. \n\nI see a lot of people who focus more on fitness as they are reaching the other side of some of the more intensive building. \n\nMy advice is that your business will be as consumptive as you allow it, and it will eat everything in its path...so be very intentional if you want anything else in your life. Draw hard lines, and make it a priority.",

Especially if that business is very different than their full-time job - usually one gives way to the other.

Oprah Winfrey is noted to be a phenomenal boss. And I see people selling companies for half a billion  or so through the years, who are truly good people. And that doesn't count all the people selling \"smaller\" companies for $20-50m, or less at $4-6m - who are probably pretty darn happy out there, who had a small team and they all walked away doing pretty well. \n\nAre there wage disparities in company salaries? Of course. \n\nIn Tech --&gt; The founder takes all the risk (if a founder led company), and builds it from the ground up. They are often underpaid for years...when employees actually make more than they do. (They have ownership equity and very little salary for long periods at times - hoping that equity pays off, though often it goes to zero) They spend countless hours, holidays, weekends, and nights working while their employees are not. They are responsible for the wages of sometimes hundreds or thousands of people...and when it pays, it pays big. We only hear the wins...not when they take small salaries for years, and then it all goes to zero...with engineers or others making really solid salaries in the meantime. In tech, sometimes it doesn't work the way the media portrays. \n\nIn corporate --&gt; There are also wage disparities of c*orporate* CEOs and their workers - and those are dramatic. No doubt. This is about maintaining shareholder value (people invested in that company - including pensions that are invested and rely on it, etc.). They are propping up an *entire system*, not just their company, and they are rewarded as such. Is it still a bit much for some? Maybe. \n\nAre some more likely to be sociopathic? I think studies show that there are more in some professions than others....but it is not a \\*necessary\\* factor to being ultra successful or ultra wealthy. You can have an amazing life, while also being an incredibly solid person. I am fortunate to see that all the time. \n\nThere is a saying that \"people get the companies they deserve\" - so build a company that reflects you, your values, and how you want to do business.",

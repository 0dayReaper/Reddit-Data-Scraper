Like posting on public forums fine but don\u2019t contact people privately or anything like that.

These replies are insane by the way. Everybody knows someone he\u2019s affected, including myself. Dude has had a LONG reach since the MySpace days. He goes by Kawaii Monster (cringe) now because his name just brings up all of the allegations. He is still the textbook definition of [Musical AIDS](https://youtu.be/iI6KG1KH2Is).",

That whole scene was just garbage.\n\nEDIT: it was late 2007 through 2008. she says that she stopped talking to him after she caught him basically giving another girl the same line of bullshit and they compared notes.",

It's wild to think that he's been doing this shit for almost 13 years now. Unfortunately that scene was and probably still is predominantly unsupervised somewhat will off teenage girls. \n\nThere seem to have been a lot of predators in that community but this guy is definitely the most notorious. \n\nThere were some local like electronic bands around the same time that this was a pretty big problem with to a couple of them were based out of Granite City I don't recall what they were named. \n\nI really only know about it around here because I was pretty involved in the music scene in St Louis around 2005 to 2009. it's not just that scene that has problems, there's a lot of accusations going around the local punk scene now, I've seen on Facebook recently over the past two years. The local metal scene is pretty bad for it. I think the thing that really stands out with the \"scene kids\" though is how normalized large age gaps are.",

                    "comment": "The show wouldn't be entrapment. For something to be entrapment, the police or government has to induce someone to commit a crime they otherwise wouldn't have committed.\n\nChris is not acting on behalf of the government, so that's one strike against an entrapment defence.\n\nBut the real question of it is this: Was Chris getting people to do something illegal that they **otherwise wouldn't do?** These guys were looking for underage girls, and it's reasonable to assume they would have tried to do the same thing with someone else (i.e an actual underage girl). \n\nChris didn't force them to do anything they weren't already wanting to do. He didn't make them drive to the house or send explicit messages against their will.  \n\nThese guys were already planning to meet underage girls for sex. Chris just let them think that they had succeeded.\n\nMore on what entrapment is (and isn't) here:\n\nhttps://lawcomic.net/guide/?p=633",

Joseph Roisman's case went to trial and the judge threw it out after the prosecution rested their case and before the defense had a chance to present their case. He had scathing words for your partners, Perverted Justice, as well as the prosecution. If he's the only one who was ever acquitted, at the very least, surely you'd remember him as the one that got away?\n\nhttps://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/2289893-181/man-acquitted-of-charge-stemming\n\nEdit: And there was also Anurag Tiwari from the same sting, whose two felony charges were dismissed. He ultimately plead guilty to an infraction, which is a crime on the order of a speeding ticket. He sued you for claiming he had been \"convicted of attempted lewd and lascivious acts with a child.\"\n\nhttps://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20111025d32",

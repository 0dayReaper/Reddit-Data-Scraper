    "postText": "As a seasoned psychotherapist and certified addiction therapist, I\u2019ve seen first-hand through my patients the way the COVID-19 pandemic has increased feelings of isolation, particularly among men. As pandemic restrictions have been lifted and people\u2019s daily activities have returned to normal, many of the men I see have had a hard time re-entering society due to feelings of anxiety. Men tend to be reluctant to seek help and often find it difficult to trust the process of therapy and make themselves vulnerable. My practice is dedicated to helping my patients break down the barriers that keep them from getting the help they need, and providing them with the tools to be comfortable with who they are and confident enough to share themselves with others.\n\nWe will begin at 3:30pm ET and end after 30 min\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/79a08wr2w20b1.jpg",

I\u2019m in a liberal state with a Medicaid expansion and I went through the process with an organization whose goal is to get low income people hooked up with mental healthcare. The person submitting my paperwork made a mistake that meant I had to wait two months to try to apply again. The next time wasn\u2019t successful either because nobody told me that you\u2019re supposed to wait to get rejected, appeal the rejection, then drop the appeal once an appeal hearing is scheduled with a judge, *then* reapply. I ended up giving up after six months. \n\nIf there\u2019s a community organization you can call and say \u201chi, I need mental healthcare\u201d and they say \u201csure, can you come in next Tuesday?\u201d that would be great, but I haven\u2019t found one yet.",

Nervous breakdown is a catchall term.  You just know you blew a gasket, and you don't feel like yourself after a few weeks, or months.  It's very common in your 20's.\n\nMost psychiatrists want you to suffer through many sessions with a Psychologist before they see you.  Of course, there are many that will take your money though, and many do charge a lot for dealing out those drugs.\n\nThe good news is most drugs really don't work much better than Placebo.  \n\nTo disenfranchised to write at this moment.",

There is a lot of bureaucracy which can be hard to navigate. Organizations can make this easier, but people ultimately still have to do this for themselves",

I was also an active alcoholic who got sober, but I had those same problems prior to my alcoholism and self medicated for my anxiety; among other things.\n\nThe general pattern I found that got me out of my depression, anxiety, and isolation was by looking at my life, deciding to start fixing things from the ground up and fully immerse myself in it.  I just picked one thing at a time that was around me in my apartment and fully tried to solve it, which made me think about what \"solved\" meant to me.  It was kind of a mix of mindfulness through being fully into what I was doing, and the discipline of doing it to full completion.  Over time, I started doing things that involved going out more.  The more I built up this collection of skills and work, which reflected in my well run life, the less I was anxious and depressed.  That and I started looking at myself as one small part of a larger world, rather than things being centered around me and my ego.\n\nI don't know if it would work the same with you but that worked with me.

Something I found through the praxis that I described where I didn't settle for \"good enough\" and instead fully defined \"good\" and pursued it is that most of these things weren't really that hard.  They were hard when I didn't put any thought into them, but after I really thought through them and devised a series of strategies that coalesced into a plan; executing on that became easy.\n\nWhat I think was the key was that, doing this over time made me start to identify what mattered to me on a first principles level.  I'd see the patterns of that across all the different tasks I did.  The more I gained insight into that and used it to deal with things in my  life, the more I build a solid and comprehensive foundation in my mind and psyche.  Before that, I was just a bunch of scattered things that were trying to work together in my mind; which made me depressed and anxious.  The movement away from the latter towards the former seemed to be the key in what solved things for me.\n\nGood luck in your foundation year!  You can do it!",

Personally, no amount of sleep helped me feel rested. \n\nAbsolutely zero libido. Not even the random sexual thought. Brain fog prevented me from thinking clearly at times. \n\nThrow in a dash of depression and increased anxiety. No matter how much I worked out I couldn\u2019t ever progress or gain muscle. \n\n All that led to not being in the best of moods. \n\nNot an M.D. but, as far as when it should be treated is if you experience low T symptoms. This varies from man to man but most experience the most common symptoms. \n\nA lot of the times it pops up when men start to reach their 40s. Most insurance companies won\u2019t cover testosterone because they feel you are not hypogonadal until you are an old man.\n\nI will add, at least here in the states, based of off anecdotal experiences, many medical doctors, do not like to deal with treating low testosterone. \n\nYou may end up at an endocrinologist, or a urologist. They may look at the number on paper that defines what your body is producing for testosterone and see that it is low enough to be treated. \n\nMy medical doctor did the same and I ended up at a hormone clinic. They did bloodwork and while the number on paper doesn\u2019t really define if you are low on testosterone it can be something that points to it.\n\nStarted on TRT and most, if not all of my symptoms went away. Anyway, that\u2019s just my experience.",

Also to note, there is going to be honey moon period where your body is adjusting to this new exogenous hormone being entered into the body.\n\nI am going to give you my personal experience. Sex, rather the need for it is very carnal like. You feel you could just tear your partner apart (in a good way). It's really fun and I miss that feeling. Because your body still produces some T and now you are introducing more of it.\n\n\nAcne. You will get hormonal acne like a teenager does at first. Even after you are used to it, it can hang around but nowhere near as bad. Contact your provider and they will help you out.\n\nOily skin and overall being hot as fuck all the time. Really sucked when you had to wear a mask everywhere. Shower to your liking.\n\nMany clinics will start you out with a weeks' worth of dosage at once. They will monitor you week to week checking your blood. This is to make sure you aren't developing blood clots and overall health.\n\nThis will make you feel like heaven for the first several days. Got my shot on Thursday and by Sunday night I felt like the shitty me. If you can get them to send you home with prefilled needles or the bottles in general. Do it. T has a small shelf life in your body.\n\nDaily or even every other day is best to keep the peaks and valleys of hormones from happening. You can experiment. I do about 160mg a week but 20mg a day and about one day where I pin 40mg. \n\nAvoid being given an AI to block estrogen. Men produce estrogen and it raises naturally with T. Blocking the natural rise in estrogen can cause issues. I say this not as a medical provider but experience.\n\nNaturally keep in touch with your provider of any negative changes. Lastly, when you start to pin on your own, my recommendation is to use insulin needles. This does not sheer the muscle as bigger needles do which overtime develops scar tissue. Personal choice in the end. I linked a YT channel which I found has pretty useful information. Fair warning there are some political type post but I ignored many of those and went straight for the information. \n\nDM me anytime and I will be happy to answer questions. \n\n https://www.youtube.com/@TRTandHormoneOptimization",

That is a very tough challenge but we are typically the ones who need help the most. If my case manager hadn't pushed me through all my resistance I would not have taken their advice. The first few days I dismissed all of their ideas saying it wouldn't work or I don't like how that feels or this is great help for someone else, 'I appreciate your prayers but I'm probably going to hell if any of that stuff works' just such a downer.  \n\nBut she took me to the library, she took me to entrepreneurship class for starting food trucks, she helped me get a free doctor, food stamps, vouchers for goodwill, the fact that she cared so much made me feel worth fighting for. She helped me recognize the strides I had made and kept me grounded from spinning off into these isolated mental rabbit holes for weeks at a time. \n\nI took her advice that I'm not unlikable I just forgot how to have a conversation and focus the enthusiasm on the other person and let them guide things and bounce it back. So I started trying that in online dating, suddenly tons of people were interested in getting to know me, I felt like maybe this whole time I wasn't uninteresting or shitty I just forgot how to talk and make friends and believe in people much because of my own guarded attitude and low self esteem. \n\nOne of the girls I met online I randomly got into a conversation with her about job hunting and how I've been trying to move out of family house but nothing pays enough. She reffered me to start at her job, and even offered me help and advice through the interview and onboarding process. I thought I would suck at the interview but they loved my responses and conversation skills. Now for about 4 months I have this job I am getting paid well, I have a new car, looking around for houses, taking medications and supplements regularly. People believe in me and are supporting me to make the most of my skills. I have a budget, I have alarms and lists and tracking apps, fancy soaps and candles, a circadium rhythm again. I'm just a completely different person than I was 6 months ago.\n\nSorry for the rant but what I'm trying to say is without all that pushing emotional support and the boost to my ego I got from a stranger when I was broken I am just not sure how many of these things would have ended up the same. I didn't think anyone could help me, I had so many frustrating experiences. People who are feeling the most discouraged, trapped and helpless are often the ones most in need of help and the harder it is to find it the more convinced you are there is no way out, or you don't deserve it. \n\nAgain, thanks for doing what you do in your focus on outreach.",

Clinical depression kicked my ass until I found a medication that worked for me. Others may not need medication, but it could be worth discussing with your doctor, and hell, get a referral to a mental health specialist. You are not alone in feeling broken, but you probably maybe not broken at all. Wanting to get better is a good sign. The ones who are really broken are mostly convinced that they are just, \"fine.\" Be as good to yourself as you would to a great friend.",

If you are willing to face your difficulties head on, then I would be surprised if you do not see good results. and if you end up with someone you can't work with, it's just like any other work, hang on, keep going, and find a new person to work with.

Either with the straining of only focusing on the ringing or some other way I got double hearing at the same time. It scared me so much because I couldn't enjoy anything, music, radio, white noise. Nothing at all sounded normal, I tried explaining to people that everything sounded different and scary. A lot of people thought I was going crazy but the state paid for a couple audiologist visits and they ended up telling me I had to relearn how to listen. That was it. I was terrified of anything that made sound and stuck in isolation for about a year. By the end of it I had made friends with my tinnitus, it had changed its \" tone with me\" and sometimes waking me up with the most beautiful insect sounds that instantly relaxed me and made me fall back asleep. Am I crazy?",

I am merely voicing my concerns. And yes, it concerns me that the general public (*maybe* even health organizations) are taking this \"over\" approach.I personally much prefer it when the language used is being more attentive and real, and cautious. Fauci, for **example**, was cautious about saying it's over throughout. He made it a point to specify in interviews that it isn't over nor is it expected to be completely over and that we need to take that into account.\n\nBut here come other people, and this \"grain\" you speak of (which to me seems more like \"hype\" than \"grain\" but w/e), and you all just accept it as over. And the consequence is people feeling validated and justified in not giving a damn. In many cases, not even a tiny tintsy damn,\n\nNow along comes this person, who says he's a doctor (I'm not disputing whether he is or isn't, I'm just saying the title has impact), and publicly uses the word \"over\" despite simultaneously coming from a place of wanting to help people with their covid-related anxieties.So yeah, it irks me. Because part of what these anxieties stem from, is how people now don't give a rats behind about the lingering results I experience, you know?And saying it's flat out \"over\" (I mean, using that terminology for this), just straight up cuts it out puts it behind us all and blatantly ignores the lingering effects, not to mention the actual covid virus that's still out there every day essentially all over the place.\n\nI perceive it as being dismissive with one hand while handing out the other hand stating that it will be safe and protective of me.All along the first hand is giving me this dismissive motion and making me feel like the REALITY of the virus (which is definitely still here, and not in minute quantities either to be frank with you) means *nothing*, is not to be mentioned, unless I *want* to be looked at as a pariah, or be shunned just like you did to me.And for what? for stating the very real fact that the virus is out there!Because look, though as a whole we have higher immunity to it than before, it is still very much multiplying, mutating, and adapting to our lines of defense.\n\nSo excuse me if I asked not to get banned from speaking of this just because I don't ignore the reality of it, or because I want us to use truth in our terminology and not some generalizing, dismissive convenience, by saying \"oh yeah, it's over we can feel JUST as safe as we felt before the pandemic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe claims to understand the anxiety on men brought on by the effects of this pandemic on us, right?So is it really too much to ask for him to just say \"well, it's not actually over. it *has* changed and adapting to that change is hard and I  understand it and that's why I want to help, BUT it has definitely not ended and all behind us now and you're not stuck in some non-existent past\"???\n\nLook, I'm not coming all \"fists in the air\" here. I appreciate your perspective here, and I am trying to accept that you are actually coming from a good place; but please don't put your assumptions about me, *on* me.\n\nAll this to come to the defense of a person who didn't even ask for your defense?He can speak for himself. Seems very capable to me. I'm not even sure he would find my question half as offensive as you initially did.In fact, I genuinely hope by now you don't find it offensive either; and maybe you're willing to open up your own perspective as well. I'm truly not as narrow-minded as you seem to want to believe that I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\n&gt;Maybe there is a subreddit that is focused on anxiety for covid-19\n\numm.. this is what his OP was focusing on though, so I don't quite see any reason to think I am in the wrong place here \ud83e\udd14",

Honestly.  \nI would clarify that he said \"**have** come out of it\", which past tense, and therefor not *that* different than \"over\", from my perspective.  \nBut... I *will* concede that this is definitely a good point, and I appreciate your distinction here \ud83d\ude4f. I will try to keep an eye out for this distinction in the future. Thank you for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;He is a psychotherapist focused on addiction helping people that have lingering effects. This point right there clearly says he doesn't think anything's over as he is treating people still.\r\n\nThis is *exactly* my point though!  \nYeah, it clearly doesn't quite think so... so why not choose the words more carefully?  \nWhy not be attentive to the details here then?  \nThis only makes my original point stronger; the way I see it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;You had no questions only a statement about semantics AND you admitted this. You said you had a concern and not a question.\r  \n\r\n\nNo. Excuse me but absolutely no. It was a concern AND a question. I was hoping for a true debate with the Dr. I was hoping for an honest, experienced answer from him; perhaps for a discussion with him about how the perception and choice of words *does* matter, and maybe an answer to whether or not it is indeed mostly behind us, or not. I was hoping for an actual expert to either help me open my mind, or to open his along the way. It was a question. And you perceiving it otherwise doesn't change that. You seem to have seen what you wanted to see, and are just as rigid as I am. I hope we are both trying to open our minds here, but I will not accept you claiming that I had no question. I was genuine &amp; honest about my question, and I will not have you putting it in my mouth that it wasn't one. Sorry, but no.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;You did not care to engage in the AMA you just wanted to complain.\n\nWTF? I am engaging with you right now! Otherwise I would have stopped responding long ago, and I definitely not have bothered responding with respect and patience towards you after you keep calling me a troll.  \nNotice how I haven't called *you* a troll even once, as a response?  \nGive me a break with this, would you?  \nI thought we are debating here. Not dissing on each other.  \nAnd as far as engage in the AMA itself - I saw this post after the AMA was over, but decided to ask my question anyway in case he looks back here. Should I have not commented at all after having noticed that the AMA is over?  \n(to clarify: I'm not being sarcastic here, this is an actual question again. If you say I shouldn't have - I will take it to heart, and won't in the future respond to AMAs that are over).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;trying to get karma.\n\nIf this was the case I would have deleted my comment and stropped discussing with you long ago. I don't give a thing about reddit karma. clearly. Honestly I don't even understand what it is for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We cannot change reality just to make things softer for a small group of people. What we can do is make sure that small group of people feels better and make sure they get the support they need. I hope you get the help you need.\n\nFor what it's worth, I agree with you here. But the idea that it is a small group of people is preposterous, and the idea that claiming the pandemic isn't over is the part where we're trying to change reality is also untrue. The reality of the matter is that the virus is still thriving. Not as much as it used to, thank goodness, but we have a ways to go with it.  \nI think choosing our words more carefully would be a great step towards making things softer, *and* making sure we feel better and start to feel like we are getting supported by society itself. And in my opinion it is not too much to ask for. And should be done regardless. A bit more care is the socially good thing to do.  \nBut, thanks to you, I will also pay attention to the distinction you have mentioned in point 1 above. Maybe this will help take it easier when I see people carelessly throwing words like \"over\" vs people who at least care enough to say \"coming out of it\" (in present tense, at least).  \n\n\nAnd I thank you for still hoping towards this positive outcome (\"getting the help I need\") even after assuming the worst of me (being a troll ain't the best, that's for sure).  \nI am also genuinely hoping, and choosing to assume, that  you are saying this with love &amp; kindness, and that it wasn't intended as some mean, dismissing, nor derogatory remark.  \n\n\nHave we exhausted our points here? We can remain in disagreement about some things. That is ok. Can we stop here please? What do you say we leave it at that?",

Thinking of yourself as \u201cfundamentally broken\u201d locks you in to the current state and also pathologizes yourself. Nothing about you is pathological. I would describe you as deep in grief. Grief is the appropriate response to loss. But grief has a trajectory. When you\u2019re deep in it it feels like it will never end, but it does. Loss is inevitable in our lives.  When we accept that everything changes and ends, we gain more appreciation for the present and for what\u2019s still here. Breathe. Try not to be self destructive. Let time pass.

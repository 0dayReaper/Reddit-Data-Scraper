    "postText": "PROOF: https://imgur.com/a/o49WOfj\nTWEET: https://twitter.com/DiscoveryID/status/1663680606998282240\n\nI spent eight years as an Assistant District Attorney in NYC and have covered many high-profile cases as an on-air correspondent including Casey Anthony, Jodi Arias, Conrad Murray, and O.J. Simpson. I provide my insight on Investigation Discovery's \"The Curious Case of Natalia Grace\" docuseries airing May 29-31 at 9/8c and streaming on Max. You can [watch the trailer here](https://youtu.be/nTSua2EE3fg)Natalia Grace was initially assumed to be a 6-year-old Ukrainian orphan with a rare bone growth disorder. She was adopted by Indiana couple Kristine and Michael Barnett in 2010. However, their happy family dynamic soured when allegations against Natalia were brought by the Barnetts who alleged Natalia was an adult masquerading as a child with intent to harm their family. They claim she threatened her new family with knives and tried to poison Kristine. In 2013, Natalia was discovered living on her own which ignited an investigation that led to Michael and Kristine's arrest and a firestorm of questions. Here are [more facts about the case](https://www.investigationdiscovery.com/crimefeed/id-shows/5-things-to-know-about-the-natalia-grace-barnett-case)I'm ready to answer your questions.",

Unfortunately it doesn't surprise me that they could manipulate a judge. But why was this not covered more in this documentary? I feel like it was left a little murky intentionally, and that's kind of disappointing.\n\nAlso, is it possible for the original adoptive family or the adoption agency to be held liable in some way? I wish she would sue the heck out of everyone for the damage they inflicted.",

She claimed in her book that her middle son was diagnosed with  complex regional pain syndrome as a newborn and almost died of it. Firstly, as you can probably tell from the name, CRPS is not a fatal condition, and secondly, babies don't get diagnosed with CRPS. Ever. She said she almost died having her other son. \n\nJacob was diagnosed with Aspergers as a toddler and she has said repeatedly that they were told by every expert and teacher they met with that it would be a waste of time teaching him anything as he'd never be capable of even tying his shoes. She also claimed in a keynote speech she gave that her nephew almost died at birth and was not able to breathe on his own but she was able to hold him as they waited for a life flight plane (with all of his tubes removed!) and he suddenly started breathing again on his own because he felt her love. Everything is just so extra with this woman.",

My God this woman reminds me of Pamela Hupp in many ways, another case of injustice until Russ's attorney and Russ fought back. I think Kristine is just as much a danger and her and Michael should rot in jail. Natalia had everything taken from her, including her age.",

(Maybe the producers let him go on and on so he could dig his own grave.) The last 2-3 episodes consisted of Michael talking about his and Kristine's sex life, divorce, porn addiction, and preparing for court. How any woman can stomach such a man is beyond me. His defense team is grimey, too. Especially the one that kept arguing with witnesses during the depositions. \n\nI wish the last couple of episodes focused on Natalia's life now with the neighbor couple that took her into their home. Did she get an education? (Besides the GED school, which was so ridiculous.) Did she receive therapy?",

I wondered to a friend today if she was obsessed with people with disabilities because she ran a special needs daycare and had sexual relations with a little person. There is nothing odd sleeping with a little person in and of itself, but it was odd in Kristine's case because she hated her daughter with dwarfism and abused her. And she seemed to fetishize him. Combined with what you have reported here, it is very clear that Kristine is a munchie. She is a danger to her community and always will be. She has a public Facebook page, and the woman is totally unhinged. She's been posting a lot.",

Another reason, unfortunately, I know all about very early puberty. I told my Mom at age 7 my chest hurt. She felt little lumps. She spoke to my grandma on my Dad's side. She told my Mom to take me to a gynaecologist. She and all my Dad's aunts started their period at 10. Well, Mom took me to the gyno and yes, he agreed. By 8 I had breasts and I was 8 and a half when I had my 1st period. My heart BROKE for Natalia. Once my 1st period started, I had it continually until 35 when I needed a hysterectomy. So, yes, I do not understand how a doctor would not know this. Why wasn't she taken to a gynaecologist to find out if they were so worried? I believe they adopted her knowing everything. They then didn't want her  and they abused and tortured her. I saw the finale of the docuseries. Michael Barnett in my opinion definitely got away with everything and in the end, he was smirking. He mentioned double jeopardy so smuggley. \nPlus, I was disgusted at the end. So, Kristine appears to want to set up Natalia with an older man. I have had thoughts from the beginning especially after they had her reaged to 22 that some form of sexual abuse was going on. I am NOT saying anything did happen, but just how Michael said he was abused because Kristine withheld sex from him. He said he became addicted to porn. He also said he felt too that Natalia broke up his family. He was over at her 1st apartment more than Kristine. Plus at the end of the show when the producer\ntried to show him sn accusation against him, suddenly he had nothing more to say. \nI also do not understand why he had to pay $10,000 to the Ukrainian orphanage for restitution? The judge must have felt he wasn't entirely not guilty! Natalia deserved that money. She was abused and tortured by everyone in her life from the moment she came into the United States. Everyone involved should be ashamed and in prison!",

The mother was clearly abusive. The father was probably a victim of spousal abuse for most of his marriage. That\u2019s no excuse, he should have intervened on multiple occasions, when he knew Kristine was abusing Natalia. It\u2019s impossible to know what goes on behind closed doors, but the peek we got into their window, left me thinking they both need professional help. He tries to pretend that they had an idyllic life, prior to the adoption, but I find that hard to believe. He is so insecure, that he actually bragged about how many couches they owned! When Kristine filmed Natalia being chastised, it was sickening. I have not seen the finale yet, either. I am disappointed with the way this documentary was done. It was like a tabloid story, rather than what I generally expect from DiscoveryID.",

There's also a ton of stuff the Barnetts claimed via tabloid rather than claiming in court so it's mostly gone unchallenged and uninvestigated and with zero repercussions which is so frustrating.\n\nIt's so wild how a man so utterly histrionic and caught telling many destructive lies is just walking around free, I'm grateful for the intense vengeance he feels toward Kristine because if they could take each other down then maybe at least some small amount of accountability could be had. I also have a feeling there's a lot of footage from the documentary that we haven't seen which may end up biting Michael in the ass. Kristine being tech-illiterate too will come in handy because she probably has no idea that every single thing she's ever sent/texted/posted/etc is retrievable but of course it requires time and warrants and hearings and bureaucracy so god knows when/if any of it will ever come to light.\n\nI personally hope Natalia gets support from some kickass lawyers from the publicity around the series and sues the hell out of them but even if not I just hope she is able to feel peace after growing up in those conditions like damn.",

When he re-enacted K beating N, not one tear for N was shed by him. He did not try to stop the beating.  I believe he was sexually abus*ng N the entire time, the wife hated the attention he gave N., N was forced to lie and then isolated and neglected. Typical responses from someone sexually abused. He obviously shows signs of anti-social, a personality disorder, narcissism and bipolar.",

And only after 6 hours of sensationalized footage do they reveal that she was actually a child the whole time. Conveniently after they air all of her dirty laundry and share every embarrassing moment from her childhood as an abused disabled orphan. Just really irresponsible and disappointing from discovery.

I don't know if they get to this later, but Natalia's voice clearly matured and got less childlike and squeaky. She looks way older now as well, like an actual teenager. I wouldn't say it's a far shot to say her poor behavior with other children was because she *was* a child who was being *told* she was an adult. That would confuse any 6-10 year old, being thrown into an apartment by yourself and just trusting these people who have taught you nothing that you're twenty-two years old lol. Sure, she has/had some psychiatric issues. But she was in fact a child. Just listening to her vocal changes and development as well as her facial development tells me that, and her complete inability to care for herself due to being taught nothing and thrown into an apartment complex alone at what, ten years old? I am appalled by how many people in this documentary mistook genetic abnormalities that present themselves physically for adult facial features. Absolutely thick in the head.",

Look at her teeth when she first came to them...they were baby teeth for God sake! Her adoptive father appears to be at least \"2 french fries short of a bag\". Adoptive mother does not seem to be on the show, but according to Michael is a mess. Oh Gawd, he apparently has proof of her sexting with a little person ( who indicates how big his manhood is), among many others. You cannot make this up!

I am not an attorney, however, it seems her illegal age change could still be reversed with a public outcry (facts were clear as day that Natalia already had a VALID birth certificate with several doctors since 2010 verifying her age via skeletal scans and this couple literally went doctor shopping to get one yahoo of a primary doctor to sign off on their allegations of her being an adult). With Natalia's age being reversed, this couple could face criminal child trafficking (Kristine trying to solicit Natalia to an adult man as shown on her text messages and possible SA from Michael). It's unfortunate that the statute of limitations for child neglect in Indiana is 2 years but there is no limitations for SA (since 2019) and child trafficking. I also find it hard to believe that the jury couldn't convict on the abandonment of a disabled person? The prosecution certainly showed enough evidence, even without what the jury weren't able to see. The foreman didn't seem too bright, but I digress.\n\nIndiana judge should be ashamed of himself. The neighbors who thought she was a \"nuisance\" should be ashamed. The media should be ashamed for perpetuating this lie with sensationalized titles and stories. And Beth, wherever you, stop trying to gain views and acting as Switzerland, then ghost us.\n\nI have searched for petition's on this matter and could not find any. It sounds like Natalia is doing much better as a new doc is coming out this summer on ID interviewing her. She looks beautiful and wants to share her story but I have no idea if she is pursuing anything legally/civilly or not. She was never properly represented as a child (another huge legal issue) and I hope she has a good attorney to date.  Any advice is much appreciated. I am ready to start this petition (I don't live in Indiana though?).\n\nETA: Michael was charged and acquitted of abandonment of a disabled person, not disabled adult. And even without a reversal of age change (which still needs to happen) I would think the prosecution can go after both of them of SA of a disabled person if enough evidence is found and trafficking of a disabled person (Kristine's text messages to the adult male with dwarfism). Let's hope the prosecution and/or an attorney for Natalia is diligently working on this.",

All the doctors they claimed told them she was a sociopath but no medical professionals or medical records are being shown, for example.\n\nBut also there's some more subtle things they claimed which led to her re-aging. For example, rewatching the series and noticed something significant in the first episode.\n\nThe Barnetts claimed that a CPS officer told them that Natalia hadn't grown in the 4 years since her original naturalization docs... yet you can clearly see there's a video of when they first brought her home and she was too little to even step up the single stair outside the front door. There's another video in the same episode from some time later when she is still living with the Barnetts and she is clearly taller and is able to step up that same entry step. \n\nIt's not adding up and I'm wondering are there plans for any of these \"tabloid\" claims to be actively challenged???",

Poor boundaries \u2014lack of appropriate parenting. Mature then childlike? I think folks are mistaking high intelligence for maturity and also that her past didn\u2019t shelter her the way most children are sheltered. Defiant? For questioning the false reality put forth by her mother? I saw no defiance. I saw a lot of gaslighting. Agreeing to things so people will like her? Yea, desperate for love and acceptance, normal human needs. Getting close to people quickly? I agree with that one. But it also ties into her vulnerability and needing help. \n\nWhen the Barnetts filed their petition to re-age her they did not claim any diagnosis of RAD. Specifically they said she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. She was 8 years old at the time.",

I saw her on Dr. Phil, she comes across as mature for her age, so yes you could say intelligent. \n\nI would say someone who has had to learn very quickly to adapt to her surroundings to survive, much like many children who grew up in eastern European orphanages. A predictor for RAD.\n\nRAD isn't a bad diagnosis it actually explains so much of her behavior given her history and how she was so easily manipulated by her adopted mother. \n\nBut getting an accurate assessment and diagnosis is key to getting the right treatment and resources.\n\nYou can't treat RAD the same way you treat Oppositional Defiant Disorder, ODD or schizophrenia.",

Notice he only cares where she was when she was no longer making him money. I am curious if the documentary offered them a chance to speak or if you guys only intended for this to be Michael's perspective only. \n\n\nAlso, as much as I think Kristene is an evil horrible person who should be in jail for abuse, how do you justify posting her sexual photos on the documentary? Hella unethical. This entire documentary was a disgrace. The psych hospital workers also violated HIPAA. And no one was brought on to talk about the medical stuff at all. \n\n\n\nMy biggest question for you OP, is this: how can you ignore the massive ethics violations that ID committed here, from a legal standpoint?",

The whole interaction between that POS attorney Mark Nicholson who\u2019s \u201con the side of truth\u201d &amp; then proceeds to yell at the doctor about disrespect, while he\u2019s trying to tell Mr. Nicholson that the X-rays show Natalia IS A CHILD!! Oh well, as long as he can yell louder, then I guess the judge will just side with the bully. Well, there\u2019s a reason that bully doesn\u2019t  want that evidence presented or NG referred to as a child! Because she is and this bully lawyer can\u2019t lose!! He\u2019s pathetic &amp; these parents KNEW what they were doing!! DNA, X-rays and birth certificates should be enough! But there\u2019s concrete proof beyond that showing NG was a child @ that time!! I hope the state can appeal this verdict because the judge isn\u2019t letting them introduce any proper evidence! Is there any appeals process where they higher court can I return the jury verdict after knowing that HAD they been given the age info they would\u2019ve voted guilty? Or do you think the state will try &amp; being different charges, &amp; fight way harder to get the age documents in this time?",

            "comment": "It's unbelievable that Michael actually thought his behavior in this documentary made him look like an innocent victim. He looked like an absolute monster. He literally said his wife not having sex with him with sexual assault and blamed her for his p*** addiction. WTF?! Poor Jacob seemed extremely traumatized. Whole documentary just further exploited Natalia. The thought of that poor little girl living by herself at that age. Of course she was walking into people's houses and helping herself to food and everything because she was a little kid! That's how kids act. Why in the world would she as a small disabled \"woman\"  be placed amongst a bunch of men in a mental hospital to begin with? I went into this documentary thinking that she was an adult. I wanted her desperately to be an adult because the thought of her being abandoned like that was too horrifying. But now after watching Michael's behavior even without any of the other evidence I'm positive he is an abusive pos that absolutely abandoned that poor little girl when she was a child. Positive he is guilty of more though.  He thought he was making himself look better by throwing his wife under the bus and all he did was dig his own grave. It's infuriating that he got off scot-free. I hope they can charge him with other charges in the future.",

Particularly the commentary from the woman employee of the mental health facility where Natalia was improperly placed among adults. That woman and Natalia's neighbors blame Natalia for the sexual assault she endured, and frequently describe Natalia as \"asking for it\" when she couldn't possibly consent and was clearly behaving/acting out as many child abuse victims do. In many ways, they are culpable for any sexual assaults that may have occurred. What do you think that says about our culture?",

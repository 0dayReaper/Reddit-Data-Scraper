A summary of frequently asked questions.\n\nNo I will not tell you how to start an undetectable fire.\n\nThe job generally requires a bachelor's degree in engineering and a good bit of hands on experience. Licensure is very helpful. If you're interested, look into one of the major forensic firms. Envista, EDT, EFI Global, Jensen Hughes, YA, JS Held, Rimkus...\n\nI very rarely ran into any attempted fraud, though I've seen people lie to cover up their stupid mistakes. I think structural engineers handling roof claims see more outright fraud than I do.\n\nTreat your extension cords properly, follow manufacturer instructions on everything, only buy equipment that's marked UL or ETL or some equivalent certification, and never ever bypass a safety to get something working.\n\nNobody has ever asked me to change my opinion. Adjusters aren't trying to not pay claims. They genuinely don't care which way it lands, they just want to know reality so they can proceed appropriately.",

They had contractual obligations to maintain production so they had already ripped out all the cable before I got there. I asked them to ship me the cable, so they did. A few days later a semi backed up to my loading dock and dropped off six tons of burnt cable.\n\nSix. Tons.\n\nI spent the next few days going through every last piece of that cable until I found the culprit. Years before, a single run had been installed improperly. It had extra length, instead of cutting it short, the installer had left it coiled up in the cable tray. The extra heat from that was enough to damage the insulation a little bit every time it ran, until after several years the insulation finally failed entirely.\n\nThey were going to sue the installer, until they realized the installer was their own subsidiary...",

So signal wire would, as a broad general statement, be safer to coil up. But it still might have issues, especially considering things like PoE exists, or it might mess up the signal integrity, or or or.\n\nFollow the standards and the manufactuer's instructions.",

It helped that most of the cable wasn't burned. I could eliminate anything with no burns, and then narrow to the part that was most burned. Which turned out to be a coil which conveniently had melted itself into shape and couldn't uncoil any more. There were enough markings on it far enough away from the burning that I could ID the cable type, and nobody uses VFD-rated motor cable for anything but running a motor on a VFD.",

Traditionally, importers were considered the \"producer\" of products.  \n\n\"Producers\" are who is eventually on the hook for products liability cases in the US.  Who is considered the producer depends on the product itself, the merchant, and if it was imported/exported.  As a general rule, it goes as far back in the chain of custody prior to sale to get as close to the manufacturer's organization as possible domestically.  This is one of the reasons importers charge fairly substantial rates, they're taking on the liability for products where the manufacturer doesn't have a domestic business.  For example, if you buy a product from Target, and that product was sold to target by an importer, who bought it from a company in China: you can sue target, then target will loop in the importer with and argue they were merely in the chain of custody and did not alter the product.  The courts would likely find the importer to be the \"producer\" and thus on the hook.  \n\nImport/export is fairly heavily regulated and importers would generally have enough coverage to be held liable domestically.  It got tricky with Amazon because small sellers because they would skirt the appropriate import measures and then still be able to offer their goods on Amazon for sale.  There was a case roughly a year ago where an appellate court affirmed a ruling that Amazon could be considered the producer in said circumstances.  In theory this didn't change much because in product liability cases where the \"producer\" is insolvent then you go back to the next step and hold that party liable.  The case directly addresses Amazon's practices, however, which should make it easier for plaintiffs to cut some red tape.",

Daisy-chaining is more likely to lead to voltage drop rather than overheating, for example, and voltage drop on a motor load (or switching power supply) can result in more current draw and thus fire. But you'd have to chain a whole hell of a lot of cord to achieve that. I think the more likely failure mode is just by having so much exposed cable, you dramatically increase the odds of mechanical damage.\n\nOf course, that's just straight daisy-chaining. Branching multiple high-current loads off one multi-tap could definitely start a fire, as /u/Ziazan points out.\n\nOnce I got into this field, I put arc fault breakers everywhere in my house.

That intermittent contact causes an arc, which (given the right circumstances) can ignite the insulation of the wire. Alternately, you can get an arc from hot to neutral or ground through damaged insulation, same deal. The combination arc fault breaker has pretty good chances of detecting those faults and tripping, where a regular or ground-fault breaker won't.\n\nAmusingly, I once had an arc fault breaker in my house trip spuriously, repeatedly. Every time, it was during a specific moment of a specific episode of Samurai Jack. Turned out my power strip was sitting on my subwoofer, and the signal to generate the sound of gunfire was coupling into my power lines and tricking the breaker. Moved the cord, no more problems.",

I live in a brand new house built by me and my LG washer would constantly trip my arc fault breaker. I had multiple electricians come out and do tests and everything was testing as fine. Ended up running a new wire for the washer with same results, warrantied the washer and got a new one, it worked ok for a bit but the issue came back. I ended up replacing to a non-arc fault breaker, and it works fine now. But it\u2019s always a concern in the back of my mind. Am I overthinking it? I don\u2019t really know what else I could possibly do.\n\nJust wanted to hear your thoughts on it",

He would of course design them to be as safe as user-proof as humanly possible.\n\nThere was this hot-stamping press that was potentially very dangerous, so he designed it in a way that required two separate buttons to be pressed at the same time to activate the press. That way, the worker would have to use both hands to activate the press, thus making sure that no worker would lose any fingers by activating the press while inadvertently having their hand in the press. Pretty standard stuff.\n\nWell, one day this guy saw a worker smoking a cigarette with one hand while operating the press with the other hand. So this guy went to see how the hell the worker was doing this, because the press REQUIRED two separate buttons to be pressed precisely to stop anyone from operating it single-handed.\n\nThe smoking worker had attached a screwdriver to his belt, so he could press one button with a hip thrust, the other button with one hand, and he had the second hand free so he could smoke at work.\n\nAFAIK, the worker was fired instantly, because circumventing safety mesures was a fireable offense. People got second chances for mistakes, even expensive ones. But there were no second chances for people who circumvented safety measures.",

Every heating pad on the market is required by UL standards to have a particular label on it, saying \"Don't use this if you're diabetic\" among other things. Diabetics can have impaired bloodflow and peripheral neuropathy, so the pad can burn them more easily, and they might not feel it. And heating pads, just by the job they are required to do, get quite hot. I got called in on a case where a diabetic ignored the label, put a heating pad on his foot, fell asleep, and when he woke up *most of his foot was burned off*.\n\nQuestion for me was this: did the manufacturer do anything wrong?\n\nWell, the pad didn't malfunction, we confirmed that first thing. And the manufacturer followed all the applicable design standards. They *could* have put a timer on the heating pad, which would have prevented the injury. Why didn't they? Because people don't want heating pads with timers. If you google the subject, the first results are \"how do I defeat this stupid heating pad timer so it stays on?\" The first company to just say \"all our pads have timers now\" will get their lunch eaten by the other companies that don't. But timers would objectively prevent serious injuries at minimal cost and inconvenience. Every heating pad on the market *should* be required to have a timer. The only argument I could possibly make was that *the entire industry was wrong*.\n\nThe lesson here for product design is that the hierarchy of hazard controls applies there too. If you could design the product with a guard to prevent injury, but instead rely on a warning label, your design is wrong. I'm not sure if product designers are generally even aware of the hierarchy of hazard controls. I wasn't when that was my job.",

Blew the opposing block wall out of the room. (Good thing it wasn't load-bearing.) We tracked it to the underground power feed between the pad transformer and the building. An arc had formed half-way down the cable. Given the recent pest infestation of the building, the best explanation was that a mouse had crawled down the conduit and chewed through the insulation, causing an arc. And since there's not required to be overcurrent protection between the transformer and those cables, that's a whole hell of a lot of energy in that arc, which all turned into blast pressure down the conduit and into the building.\n\nWe didn't find any mouse remains, but then, we wouldn't, after that.",

This can result in a fire occurring, and a video of that made the rounds on Reddit not to long ago.\n\nFor vehicle fires we have seen an uptick in nesting material fires in engine compartments during COVID while people were not driving as much.\n\nHowever the nests can be made of sufficient size in just one night, so an animal nest in a car is nothing but bad luck, and not a sign of poor maintenance.",

But I did go to some excellent training for being an expert witness, put on by a couple attorneys, which included mock trial. One guy changed \"his\" (fictional) expert opinion on the stand, which resulted in summary judgment against him. Another time, the expert was handed some evidence and asked, \"Is this the evidence you collected\" when it totally did not match the evidence collected.\n\nI did hear of one case where the expert on the stand turned out to not even have an engineering degree or something like that. Summary judgment, client lost some absurd amount of money, it was a thing.\n\nThe standard of what a reasonable person would know is pretty important, yeah. There was one case I did that I'm still fascinated by.\n\nWoman rents an apartment, moves in all her stuff. Not long after, a breaker trips the circuit behind her bed, which doesn't have much plugged into it, basically just an old lamp. Electrician comes out while she's gone, finds burns on the outlet matching a high-resistance connection, replaces the outlet, puts everything back, and leaves. Shortly after, fire, behind the bed where he replaced the outlet.\n\nBest explanation I could come up with was that the lamp cord was damaged and arc'd, which both tripped the breaker and later started the fire. The electrician solved the wrong problem, but didn't actually cause anything new to be wrong. Now, as an engineer, I know that *a high-resistance connection does not trip a breaker*. (Unless you're running some very large non-linear load, I suppose, that draws more current to compensate for the reduced voltage, but that's not this case.) But should an electrician have known that? What would a reasonable electrician have known? I still don't know, but I wonder.",

Being in an office space, there was a sprinkler in the freezer. If you do it right, that's not a problem. And they didn't have problems, until one night the sprinkler suddenly went off for no apparent reason. No fire, no impact to the head, just lots of water. They caught it pretty fast, not much damage.\n\nUntil it happened again, and this time it was hours before anyone stopped it. The law office on the floor below was pissed. (SO. MUCH. PAPER.)\n\nThe only thing in that freezer of interest was the evaporator coil. We looked at it and discovered it was not wired according to the drawing. The defrost timer was bypassed, meaning the defrost resistor was on *all the time*. There were maintenance records of not long before the incident. A tech came out, determined that the defrost timer was shot, and ordered a replacement. Later, another tech came out and installed the replacement. Still later, a third tech determined that there was a refrigerant leak.\n\nHypothesis: the first tech bypassed the faulty timer, in order to get the freezer back online. But he didn't document that he did that, so the second tech didn't know to put it back the right way. This isn't normally a problem, because the heat pump can easily get rid of all the extra heat that resistor generates.\n\nUnless the refrigerant all leaks out and the heat pump shuts down. At which point we now have a 100W resistor dumping heat into an insulated box 24/7.\n\nWe thermocoupled up the room, turned it on, and waited. After eight hours it was over 140 degrees in that space. It would easily have set off a sprinkler head.",

Their big five-figure copper heat exchanger and everything downstream was just getting coated in this green metallic gunk.\n\nTurns out the heat exchanger had a temperature set point, and they'd set it too low. Water was condensing out of the fuel stream, but still in the presence of the other pressurized gasses in the fuel. Those gasses included carbon dioxide. That makes carbonic acid, more commonly called *seltzer water*. The seltzer was dissolving their copper heatsink, then getting blown downstream to evaporate, depositing copper oxides on every surface they could reach.\n\nAmusingly that problem isn't at all electrical.",

We determine that by reading fire patterns, which is a whole science in itself that I only dabbled in. I was a CFEI to help me work on suspected electrical fires, but there were full-time fire investigators who saw more fires in six months than I saw in my whole career. So often, there was a lead fire investigator who determined the origin, then brought me in to consult on cause.\n\nThe *cause* of the fire is the combination of fuel, ignition source, oxidizer, and circumstances that bring them together in a self-sustaining reaction. Generally, once you find the origin, you start looking for ignition sources in that area. That's often when we get into \"yes, the cause of this fire was electrical\"",

                    "comment": "Well, there was one where the proof surprised me.\n\nThe case involved a residential backup generator with an automatic transfer switch. There was a planned outage in the neighborhood. Linesman was working on the lines and got shocked, and very nearly died. The generator had backfed into the utility grid, which should not be possible with an ATS. (Why he hadn't grounded the lines before touching them is a question for his employer. Nobody asked me about that one, unfortunately.)\n\nThere were two panels in the house garage. One was powered by the ATS, the other was tied directly to the utility. We were shown pictures of a jumper from a load breaker on one panel to a load breaker on the other, which is not kosher in all sorts of ways, and would explain the backfeed phenomenon. I drove through a literal tornado to get to the scheduled inspection so I could see these jumpers, only to find that they'd been thrown in the trash a year before by an engineer whose mandate was to make the utility safe to work on. (So yeah, good call on his part, for sure, even if it screwed up my investigation.)\n\nThe electrician who had installed the generator years before swore up and down he had not put those jumpers in. The homeowner said the system had always worked fine, and nobody else had ever worked on it. One of them was lying. How could we tell who?\n\nThe homeowner was lying. Because if those jumpers had always been there, the generator would always have been tied to the grid. That means during every outage, it would have tried to support the entire neighborhood, and tripped out immediately. *It could never have worked.* If it ever worked, the jumpers weren't there, and then got added by someone to make the generator support the whole house rather than one panel.\n\nOf course, if the electrician had followed procedure, pulled a permit, and gotten his work inspected by the city, he would have had them backing him up as well. So that's a lesson too.",

I have an electric blanket and I keep that unplugged unless I\u2019m currently using it. \n\nThe one thing I do that I\u2019m sure is risky and you\u2019ll probably tell me is crazy - I have heating pads that I leave plugged in. They\u2019re turned off (and have a timer where they turn off after 2 hours on their own - I\u2019m also not a diabetic). I use them every night and sometimes have left the pad on the bed when it was turned off. That\u2019s crazy, right? Probably will kill me someday.",

Is that crazy?\n\nThe engineer who trained me said he did the same thing. I just asked, \"Wait, every time you plug and unplug your appliances, don't you increase the chance of a high-resistance connection which could--\" \"SHUT UP!!!\"\n\nSometimes in life there's what we call \"residual risk.\" Even after all safety precautions are taken, there's still some chance something bad will happen, but the benefits outweigh the risks, so we do it anyway. The risk reduction of everything you just said is non-zero, but it's very, very small. The harm caused to you by your stress over it is almost certainly greater. The risk you take driving where you're going is definitely greater.\n\nYour use of heating pads sounds fine to me (though I'm not a medical expert). Toasters are generally quite safe, as long as you don't shove paper in them or something silly. Space heaters are generally even safer. Are they 100% safe? Absolutely not. What is? But their risk level is small enough to be acceptable.",

I have a light fixture in my bathroom that was recently recalled with a hazard of \"The internal wires in the lights can be damaged, posing an electric shock hazard to\nthe consumer.\"\n\nThe cost of labor, buying a new fixture, etc. isn't insignificant, so I'm wondering if this actually poses a risk to us to actually combust or create a fire or anything.  I'm sure the advice will be to replace this, but I'm curious - **Does this actually pose any active threat or risk to my family or if this is just the manufacturer covering their rears?**\n\nThank you!\n\n[Here is a link to the recall](https://b3h2.scene7.com/is/content/BedBathandBeyond/PDF/KC/HunterFanRecallsLightingProductsDuetoShockHazard_CPSCgov.pdf)",

For insurance fraud to make sense you would have to have some pretty perverse financial setup. Desperately need to sell your house and can't, for example. Doesn't apply to me. I might have the means, but I have no motive, and motive is a big part of arson investigations.",

She cares for people with long illness as a physician with the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Dr. Juliet Morgan is a neurologist, psychiatrist, and integrative medicine physician. She cares for patients with long illness in private practice and is an assistant clinical professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.\n\nWe are the authors of [Long Illness](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/meghan-jobson-md-phd/long-illness/9780306828744/), a practical guide to living with long illnesses, from autoimmune disease to dysautonomia, long COVID to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) to chronic pain or depression.\n\nUsing evidence-based integrative medicine, we\u2019ve put together a program that legitimizes long illness and validates concerns where other physicians often dismiss them. Some things we cover are: \u2022 The foundations of long illness and what it means for your life\u2022 How to work with your medical team to get the care you need \u2022 Common symptoms \u2022 A wide range of accessible healing techniques \u2022 Your mental health with long illness and how to manage it\u2022 Long term solutions\n\nAsk us anything!\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/3ONRGtx)!",

                    "comment": "Thank you for your question Kingdavid100! \n\nFibromyalgia, for those who don\u2019t know, is when someone has widespread musculoskeletal pain for &gt;3 months, usually with other symptoms like fatigue, sleep issues and some will have cognitive issues (ex. Brain fog) and/or psychiatric issues. When someone is examined, they have tender areas of soft tissue, lab testing is normal (you test for other diseases than can cause muscular pain to rule them out).\n\nIf your primary care doctor thinks you might have fibromyalgia, they should refer you to a sub specialist to ensure that you are getting the proper testing to rule out other diseases that mimic fibromyalgia. Anyone with fibromyalgia and another rheumatic disease should have their fibromyalgia diagnosed and managed by their rheumatologist. After diagnosis, your primary care doctor should be able to manage many with fibromyalgia. Note: some primary care doctors have special expertise in FM, these recommendations are just generalizations and might not always hold true, this is ideally what we recommend. We realize that some people cannot get into a rheumatologist and might benefit from starting treatment for FM if their primary practitioner recommends its, and that is fine because many of the treatments have generally low risk and can be monitored and managed by a primary care doctor. However, if possible we recommend at least that your PCP consults with rheumatology if possible and especially if your diagnosis is unclear or you are not responding to treatment.\n\n**The treatment is:**\n\n\\-Education on diagnosis and prognosis\n\n\\-Education on evidence for exercise and other therapies\n\n\\-You will be evaluated for sleep and mood issues and referred or treated for those\n\n\\-Most patients will be offered a trial of medications (these are medications that sometimes are called anticonvulsants or antidepressants but have been found to be effective in fibromyalgia)\n\n\\-Most patients are started on an exercise program\n\nFor those that don\u2019t respond, we recommend they see a rheumatologist or expert in FM. Combination of medications, referrals to physical therapy, physiatrists, therapists, and multidisciplinary programs focus on FM might be recommended.\n\nThe best practice is that all **patients should be reassured that fibromyalgia is a real illness** and is not imagined or in your head. Your practitioner should be able to **explain centralized pain** to you (nociplastic pain) if you want to have that discussion.\n\nFM is an area of active research, especially since some people who have had covid infection are now being diagnosed with FM. This means that the number of people with FM is likely going to increase, and so awareness about the disease is important, since there are evidence based treatments that can be trials.\n\nRemember that not everything that is evidence based works for everyone. Everyone is different and that is why its so important to try to build good communication with your practitioners and your illness community. Hope this helps!",

I only took 1-2 pills a day but became dependent on them due to the increased amount of pain I felt when I was off them, and that became a vicious cycle. 6 years later I finally decided to get off and dealt with the worst 2 weeks of pain I\u2019ve ever felt\u2026and suddenly it VANISHED. I felt better than before, as I have also done countless hours of PT, exercise, therapy, etc. also to note with that, I do not have ME/fibro, so I was luckily able to partake in more activities to try and help abate the pain. The point I\u2019m trying to make is even though I luckily had to struggle far less than some people, it still was so mentally draining looking for answers when I felt like there was none. \n\nIf I got to tell my past self to not take tramadol 6 years ago, my past self would have been SO mad \u2014 why are they taking this option away from me!? I need to  have this and some hope to feel better!\u2019 But in the end it really wasn\u2019t worth it for long term use. \n\nLook up how they can contribute to your body\u2019s sensitivity to pain, even if it is momentarily helping pain.",

We found one that also specializes in back pain. She had severe pain in her back and SI joint from previous injuries, medications and physical therapy didn't help. She ended up getting nerve ablations in those areas ro help relieve the pain. Hopefully she will be able to do better physical therapy now that she's not exercising with pain. \n\n- we invested in a Purple mattress with an adjustable base, and that's helped with pain relief and being able to sleep. She also spends most of her time sitting up in bed as that's the most pain free position. \n\n- pool therapy is the best exercise for relieving pain and keeping mobility. Excercising when you're in pain is difficult, but laying around all day and and having your body stiffen up due to lack of movement will only makes things worse in the long run. Increased weight also puts more strain on the body and increases pain.\n\n- in addition to increased nerve sensivity/pain one of her symptoms is tight fascia. Heat packs and massages can useful for treating that symptom. She goes to massage therapist about once a month, her fascia tightens back up almost immediately afterwards, but it helps with pain relief. \n\n- if you have access to cannabis, that's a good option for breakthrough pain. Do online research for the specific strains that are available at the dispensary to find ones that effective for pain.\n\nFibro is a wide diagnosis for unexplained chronic pain, so it will be different for everyone. Some people are able to manage it and leave relatively normal lives. In my wife's case, she's pretty much become legally and medically disabled over the past year. I also highly recommend therapy for caregivers of people with fibromyalgia - caregiver's fatigue/stress/guilt is real. The effects of long term fibro on mental health and marriage is the same as when a spouse is diagnosed with cancer - the main difference being that fibro is not a terminal illness.",

It is for people with all long illnesses and not just post viral illnesses. It is merely a resource for ideas on managing your long illness and we specifically address the concerns in your post in our book. Our book completely agrees with the CDC recommendations and NICE guidelines. \n\nCBT is a tool that can be used for specific situations, some people with ME/CFS might find it useful, for example if they have insomnia, where CBTi is helpful for some people. No one is suggesting that people use aggressive exercise or therapy to treat or cure their ME/CFS! That is really outdated. \n\nCheck out these references, although not everyone is going to agree on everything on these pages, I think this is a good place to start! \n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/treatment/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/treatment/index.html)\n\nhttps://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/conditions-and-diseases/mecfs",

It has happened to me more times than I can count, even as a physician. There are great articles written by others about their experiences. It speaks to many large structural issues in medicine. \n\nHowever, it's 100% okay for you to say, \"Hey, I feel like you are dismissing these symptoms.\" We talk about this in our book, because it's such a common problem. Sometimes talking about it is really helpful. I have had some patients call me out before, and while sometimes I am a little defensive, I honestly am thankful that I am getting feedback so I can be a better practitioner to everyone. Many doctors want to do a good job, so tell them what you need. \n\nSometimes, it's just not a good match. Sadly for some of us, we are stuck with the practitioners we have.

See my other comment i wrote today about it.\n\nEDIT - one question ive been asking myself for a while now is - is it helpful to receive a label (diagnosis) if nothing is done about it. From talking to patients with chronic illness i hear a resounding yes and i think this is because it helps them feel validated. They are not alone. There symptoms are shared with others. They can seek self help and support groups? But i also wonder sometimes if it gives people a victim complex which can cause problems",

Are thyroid conditions generally thought to be a symptom of something else, such as chronic inflammation, or some other autoimmune disease? I've heard that thyroid disorders are becoming more common. Other than iodine deficiencies, what else may be contributing to this?",

I knew for years i have psoriasis but nothing came up on labwork. I haven't been tested in about a year but my tpoaB has been getting worse as I get older, especially since pregnancy (2018) AND covid. \n\nInterestingly, my psoriasis symptoms now are under control as long as I avoid trigger foods and eat \"gut healing\" foods (i make my own chicken bone broth and eat raw garlic lol) when I have warning flares  ....  but the  antibodies and the symptoms of hypothyroidism are getting worse. Tsh t3 t4 free t etc being in \"normal range\", but not necessarily normal \"for me\".\n\nThis doesn't answer your question at all and it's mostly word vomit i guess lol but I'm interested in an answer *besides check out the book.",

I may be more inclined to read it if it covers topics like this, amongst a few others.\n\nI'm unsure if I've ever had a tpo test. I never get the full labs I want, just the usual basic checks. My TSH, t3, and t4 levels are 'normal' with the levo I'm currently taking, but I generally feel worse than before I was diagnosed. I have a strong feeling they're missing something, but can't be arsed to investigate closer (insurance limitations, I assume).\n\nI'm tempted to get all the blood tests available from somewhere like Life Extension, but they're pricey. Wish I was rich enough to stay on top of full labs, scans, etc. Insurance isn't cutting it.",

Is it below 10 mIU/L?  I think when my symptoms were worst, my TSH was still at around 7.  They didn't test any other element at that time.  After taking Levo, the numbers were always below 3, and usually between 1 and 2, so TSH has improved markedly.\n\nSeems like my total T3 is always at a level just above being flagged as \"low\" even with Levo, so probably a conversion problem (?).  Last test total T3 was 76 ng/dl.  I also usually have flagged thyroglobulin antibodies, but again just barely above \"normal\", which is (I've been told) a general sign of an inflammatory autoimmune condition.",

I also have high HHV-6 IgM/IgM and high CMV also all lights up positive. Been sickly since I was 14 when had air hunger causing vocal tics and was unfortunately immediately put on a very high dosage of Ativan to take indefinitely. But I was very sickly even before the Ativan. I went from running a 7 minute mile and 4 hour tennis matches to not being able to function much. Now I'm 40 and nearly bedbound with low stamina and POTS. Even though this happened very suddenly in high school I think the way in which it lingered and the anxiety diagnosis has made it so no one has ever seen what I've said all along was the real issue. I even said at the time that Ativan was like my breathing medicine. The only thing it did was make me care less that I wasn't able to breathe well. I never had a pediatrician/PCP etc. There was a lot of neglect. I went straight to a psychiatrist and the evaluation was very perfunctory and the response very authoritarian (was mocked for being afraid of taking Ativan\u2014but my fears ended up being well founded\u2014now told too medically unstable to taper). My PCP doesn't know what to make of my EBV results. He just repeats the tests every once in a while to see if they're still positive, and they always are. An EBV DNA test was done several times and is usually negative but was once at the very low end of reportable. Since the emergence of Long Covid and seeing people's stories on Twitter, I've noted what they are going through matches exactly what happened to me in high school 26 years ago, except that I was not on the Internet and very quickly funneled to psychiatry and benzos. But their description matches what happened to me--including the cognitive. In middle school I had read all of the high school curricula, and by 14 when this started I had to start reading out loud to myself to focus. I never thought it could be ADHD because I was older than normal when it started, but it was like that.\n\nMy doctor is always swamped and so I don't really get the attention I need. He once tried making a referral to infectious disease when he still had a nurse who could do the leg work, and I was told they rejected seeing me but was never told why. Whatever I do now I need to do of my own accord because I can't even been able get my glucose test strip prescriptions sent in for over a year--the office is just under water and he's near retirement age flying solo.\n\nI've never even been told if my EBV results are significant. The testing was first done by another psychiatrist (I no longer see) who tested her entire panel and was selling supplements and I just happened to actually test positive. But the tests have been done many times since then from reputable labs. The reason I wonder if they're significant and at all explain my symptoms is that I know most people would have positive IgG, and I know there are certain disease where the IgM values are meaningless (like in HSV-2). I've asked my doctor if that's the case with this, and he said he doesn't know. It does fit with how sickly I am. I often have a temp. Often have a sore throat. Often flu like. And again the stamina issue along with POTS (I take a beta blocker).f\n\nEdit: My ANA is also positive, but I can't remember which ones. But I know ANA can be positive in healthy people (but I am not healthy).",

We were motivated to write this book when we saw the parallels between long covid and illness that people we know, including one of the authors, experienced when being sick as a teenager. We address most of your questions in our book. Long illness is really to be a handbook, a reference for all the top symptoms and interventions that people who are dealing with a long illness need to have access to. It's a good jumping off point with lots of references to other materials and sources of material we recommend based on our experience as physicians, friends, moms, and patients ourselves. \n\nWhile I can't interpret tests for you or give medical advice without being your physician, These days you can order medical tests over the internet and take them in the comfort of your own home. It is easy to get data about your body: DNA tests, stool microbiome, allergy tests. But what do the results actually mean? How do they affect your life?\n\nWe talk about testing in our book. Your practitioner should be able to explain why they are ordering a test and be able to interpret the results. If they are unable to interpret it, they need to send you to a specialist who can. That is why many tests are only ordered by certain specialists. When they get the results they have the expertise to go through your results and look at your symptoms and history and make decisions about what the test results mean. \n\nGood luck to you and I hope you find someone who can go through your results with you. Message your practitioner and ask if you can have an appointment just to go through your results.\n\nFingers crossed. We are well aware of how challenging it is out there. That is why we wrote this book!",

                    "comment": "Thanks ThoughtCenter87 for your questions! Dr Jobson here.\n\n1. **\u201cWhy do a lot of doctors not believe that conditions like CFS exist despite them being medically recognized diseases, and how do you get physicians to recognize that patients have such diseases without being brushed off?**\n\nWhen things change, that is hard for some people. When things aren\u2019t easily testable, some people are frustrated by that. I can\u2019t speak for these people, because I have never been taught or thought that these were not real diseases. The medical system has a lot of systemic issues that don\u2019t reward, and often penalize, practitioners who provide quality care to patients. Practitioners are burnt out and most do not agree with how the system works.\n\nFor those who are frustrated with dealing with patients that don\u2019t have a \u201cstraightforward\u201d issue (quotes because some things we think are straightforward end up becoming complicated!) or might not even believe something exists - I encourage them to think about what it must be like to be in the patients position. Most practitioners, if given a little time to empathize, will come around. Most practitioners came to medicine because they wanted to help people feel better. The system can make some jaded and come across unkind. I am sorry for that and I am hopeful things will change in the future. It has to, for all of us!\n\n**\u200b2. \u201cHow do doctors diagnose conditions like CFS which often do not have many physical markers of their presence?\u201d**\n\nIn diseases that do not have a sensitive and specific test, usually there is an organization of experts on the disease that meets and agrees on diagnostic criteria for a disease. These criteria are not static and change as we learn more about diseases. Physicians who have been trained more recently are more likely to include patient groups and patients in these discussions because they are the true experts in the disease experience. This can be very helpful and for example in the ME/CFS community it was patient advocacy that led to changes in recommendations for treatment. For ME/CFS specifically there are several groups that have diagnostic criteria and most practitioners will use one of these sets of criteria to give a diagnosis. It can be helpful to get a second opinion for diagnoses of all kinds. If you have that access, I encourage it. If not, you can ask your practitioner if they can talk to a colleague. Many practitioners do that as part of their general practice before diagnosing someone with a significant disease like ME/CFS, to make sure they aren't missing anything else.\n\n**3. \u201cIs there any hope that ME/CFS will be more medically recognized by doctors and healthcare workers in the near future due to the medical recognition of long covid?\u201d**\n\nYes, I am hopeful that because there has been a huge increase in numbers of people who have long illness, that research funding will increase. Certainly long covid has been associated with blossoming or unveiling of other conditions that might have been lingering or might be triggered by the covid-19 infection. It\u2019s going to take time to sort it out, but people are working on it. I have hope that the future generations of doctors will be more open minded, patient centered, and aware of the limits of their discipline.",

The reason doctors get the impression that CFS isnt \u201creal\u201d is because there are certain diseases that can be diagnosed with objective evidence (clues that the disease is there regardless of what the patient tells you) and some that are described without any use of objective markers (its all what the patient tells you). We are trained to believe what patients tell us without question, but in reality we know some people lie for ulterior motives (the benefit of the victim complex or malingering or they are lonely they want attention) - these people exist and yes i know that makes me sound unempathetic but its true. \n\nSecondly doctors have a lot of pride in their profession. An often touted phrase (for good reason) is that it is evidence based. But there is little evidence for a objective pathophysiological mechanism (something we can see objectively in the body) in these conditions - so we disbelieve they exist. \n\nAlso doctors like to feel powerful. We are taught to diagnose and provide management and see people get better - it makes us feel successful and we can pat ourselves on the back. So we hate it when people have disease we cant treat effectively. So we lie yo ourselves that the patients symptoms are made up to protect our ego.",

In fact there are doctors that specialize in these mysterious conditions - they're rare but CFS specialists are real. So why do doctors still deny the existence of these real diseases if they are in medical texts and are acknowledged in the medical world? Is it because they can't be treated, so doctors would rather dig their heads in the sand and pretend they don't exist instead of acknowledging current scientific literature?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Secondly doctors have a lot of pride in their profession. An often touted phrase (for good reason) is that it is evidence based. But there is little evidence for a objective pathophysiological mechanism (something we can see objectively in the body) in these conditions - so we disbelieve they exist.\n\nThe mechanism exists, it's just that there hasn't been enough research into these conditions, so the mechanism isn't known. Maybe if the existence of the conditions stopped being denied so often because \"oh the mechanism doesn't exist because we've yet to see it\" there'd be more research poured into these conditions to discover the specific pathophysiological mechanism behind them. It doesn't make sense for these conditions to simply not have a mechanism in the body, that goes against the laws of physics - such conditions just don't appear out of thin air - it's simply that the mechanism has yet to be discovered. But considering the amount of people who have conditions like MS, CFS, and long covid, their existence is very real... the conditions are just mysterious due to the lack of research done for them.",

Lots of \u201cprofessionals\u201d are just quacks looking to make money off people. You definitely need to be wary of people you pay for diagnosis and treatment. A slightly related example might be - ADHD diagnosis are shooting through the roof right now because people go to private clinics for labels to their subjective poorly defined non specific symptoms and then they get a lifetime supply of amphetamines if noone asks anymore questions.  \n\nThe other issue is obviously that doctors are ignorant sometimes - they havent read all the latest evidence and papers in relation to each condition. Patients have the time and interest to read at lenght about their condition. But as a professional if you are ignorant you need to admit that and maintain a humble attitude - dont be an arrogant doosche you dont know everything. But also patients who dont have medical training need to be wary of the sources they use for reading. You can read any theory you like online. You can read the earth is flat if you like. \n\nIn response to your second paragraph - yes research into conditions causing significant mortality and morbidity should be done. What mechanisms or theories are you aware of for cfs? I do find the condition interesting from an ethical and philosophical psychological standpoint",

            "comment": "I was diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis several years ago, but had been showing symptoms for nearly 20 years (since my late teens).  I had no insurance for much of that time so any time I did go to the doctors, I was basically just mounting debt with no answers as no doctor would do anything but send me for an MRI and tell me to take tylenol (no evidence of problems, yet chronic debilitating pain off an on for years).\n\nHow do people convince a doctor that the issues are real?  How can anyone get a diagnosis if there is no attempt to dig deeper into family history or any other medical tests?  \n\nNow that I have a diagnosis, I've been being treated with biologic infusion therapy (Avsola every 8 weeks) as well as NSAIDS (Nabumatone 1000mg/day).  I'm in the process of changing Rheumatologists and the new one says that the medicines I'm on are not very safe for long term use.  I've known this from my own research into my condition, so what are the alternatives?  The Avsola is supposed to be slowing the progress of damage to my spine (degenerative disk disease, bulging disks, compressed disks, multiple levels of osteophytes from my cervical, through thorasic, into lumbar and in my SI joints, which were described as \"near fusion\").  The NSAID I'm on is the only one that I've been able to take without severe side effects, but my blood work has been coming up with various levels (kidney and liver numbers) being above normal range for a long time now.  The rheumy says she will be changing my medications in the near future.  What else is there to be looking at?  (She mentioned an oral biologic to replace the Avsola, but can't remember the name at the moment.)\n\nI haven't had a major flare up since I started the Avsola, but have had increases in pain frequency.  What used to be once or twice a month of real bad days has turned into several days each week.  I finally started receiving disability this year after years of struggle and fighting for it.  I can barely make a meal without having to collapse afterwards from the pain.  I'm 45 now, what is my future going to bring?\n\n(I realize this is a lot of questions and probably most you can't answer without my full medical history/record.  Just looking for general advice for moving forward and trying to restore some of the life I've lost due to these issues.) \n\nedit:Realized I didn't even mention the mental health issues I've dealt with over the years, but they are just about as severe as the chronic pain and other issues...  Diagnosed with BPD in teen years, many different meds and hospitalizations all through late teens, 20s, and 30s, even had an episode 3 years ago which landed me in the hospital for 12 days.",

Basically either being ignored or accused of drug seeking by most doctors until eventually I got a diagnosis after almost 15 years of symptoms. I\u2019ve had the most benefits from injectable biologics (simponi) but I do get really bad flares sometimes and I find high doses of CBD with moderate to low amounts of THC really help with those. CBD is a known anti inflammatory and TNF-alpha inhibitor as well, and the THC kind of has a narcotic effect helping you ignore the pain, which is why I think it works so well. It does interact with some NSAIDs and steroids like prednisone and may affect your mental health in some way so definitely ask a pharmacist or your doctor before trying. Other things that worked for me were cutting out fast digesting carbs (sugar, alcohol, pasta, most bread, chips etc.) quitting smoking and strengthening my lower back and legs with weight training. Foam rolling, and a heating pad can really help as well although now I find I rarely need them anymore. At 37 my body feels better than it did at 18. This is all probably stuff you\u2019ve heard before but hopefully some of it helps a bit.",

Glomerulonephritis is when the part of your kidney that filters blood (called the glomerulus or glomeruli) get inflamed or injured. Infections (ex. strep throat, HIV, HBV, HCV), autoimmune disease (ex. lupus, IgA, anti-GBM), vasculitis (ex.PAN, GPA), and sclerosis (ex. high blood pressure, diabetes) can cause the disease. A biopsy of the kidney is taken and a pathologist will stain and interpret the biopsy. This information, along with some blood and urine tests, can help identify an underlying cause or causes of your disease. However, for some people, the disease is called idiopathic (which means, don\u2019t know the cause or arises sporadically).   \nWhen immune complexes are seen, we mostly think about autoimmune disease, infections, and monoclonal gammopathies. Your doctor likely ran many blood tests, which will allow them to know what probably did not cause the disease, but they might not be able to tell you exactly what did cause it. I hope this helps!",

Your bring up lots of important topics we address directly in our book *Long Illness!* \n\nFirst, I want to apologize that you have not found a care practitioner that has been able to help you. Sadly, we are way behind when it comes to understanding and managing pain. I think there are many people in Pain Medicine who are trying to change the field. There are many new treatments and innovations that are coming down the pipeline for different conditions and for pain itself that can help improve pain for some. Because it can be hard to treat pain, and many practitioners do not have training in how to understand or talk about pain, it can feel isolating and dehumanizing. \n\nRecently trained practitioners are learning new approaches to pain. I poured alot into the pain chapter as a symptom management doctor (palliative care) that works with pain on a daily basis, I also live with chronic pain and am very aware of the shortcomings. Even as a well connected doctor at a major medical center, there is not adequate support and information. That is why we put our pain chapter front in center in our book as it is what brings many people into see us in the first place. \n\nWould love what to hear what you think about the chapter and continue this conversation. Follow us on instagram u/longillness (longillness) and on our website [longillness.com](https://longillness.com). \n\nI have not read this particular review, but I am familiar with some of it.

That's a hard question, the truth is because long covid is new, we don't have good data on whose symptoms will go away and whose will linger. There is alot of different data out there, but it is preliminary and long covid might look different in people who received different vaccines (ex. the bivalent recipients might have shorter durations of long covid symptoms). We just don't know for certain. \n\nFor you, it sounds like you are still having some symptoms. Check out our book *Long Illness* for tips and tricks of how to talk to your health care practitioners about your symptoms and to learn more about them yourself.

This book is not only for people who have long illnesses, but also for practitioners to broaden their horizons.  Historically, this is nothing new, with the medical establishment rejecting ideas about new diseases. I think the ME/CFS community has done an amazing job advocating for itself and getting major recognition and poorly done research debunked. \n\nIt's not just ME/CFS patients though, many people with long illnesses get treated like this, and it needs to end. I've worked alongside many newer physicians and I think a change is already underway. \n\nThank you for sharing your frustrations! Dr J",

We see a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety in this population. Depression and anxiety are a natural response to problems like inflammation, pain, and brain fog (amongst others.) But, this doesn't mean that there aren't ways to help. \n\nIn our book, we expose our readers to exercises from many schools of psychotherapy: Acceptance Commitment Therapy, Internal Family Systems, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. This way, people can get a sense of different options for therapy and can explore self-healing if they do not have access to a psychotherapist. We also have journaling prompts, mindfulness practices, and even a narrative medicine chapter to explore your story. In addition, we review what integrative treatment for depression and anxiety can look like, mixing biomedicine with natural products, lifestyle medicine, and traditional medicine.",

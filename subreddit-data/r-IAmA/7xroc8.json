Or gardening\u2026 or making jam.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t MAKE me come down there!\u201d That\u2019s what it feels like\u2014like we have to deal with misbehaving kids in the backseat of a car. \u201cI WILL turn this state around!\u201d\n\nSomeone has to, right?\n\n---\n\n#Evidently we can\u2019t leave governance to those who want to do it as a career. Sometimes regular people have to step in and demand we work on issues that will help people rather than engage in party politics. We need more public servants, and fewer politicians.\n\n---\n\n\n###Links:\n\n* [Website](https://lissalucas.com/)\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lissalucaswv/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LlysseWylle)\n\n\n\n###[Donate](https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/holler)\n\n**[HOLLER!

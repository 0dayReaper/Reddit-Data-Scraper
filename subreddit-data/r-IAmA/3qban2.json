    "postText": "The Senate is about to vote on a bill to reward companies that hand over your data to the NSA. We\u2019re privacy advocates trying to stop it. Join us and call your lawmaker to vote no on the bill: https://stopcyberspying.com and https://decidethefuture.org\n\nThe reason you keep hearing about these bills is that we keep beating them. The other side has full time lobbyists pushing them every single day. We have you. But together, we keep winning.\n\nWith your help, we've stopped CISA, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, and other \"cybersecurity\" bills for years; however, they keep on coming back. Last week, the Senate scheduled CISA for a  final vote TOMORROW. We've been here before. And you already know the bill is a [surveillance bill in disguise](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/eff-strongly-oppose-cisa-cyber-surveillance-bill-and-cfaa-amendment).\n\nPeople have sent millions of faxes (you read that right) to Congress, tweeted at senators, sent emails, and made calls. Over 50 organizations and companies oppose the bill including Access, ACLU, EFF, FFTF, Apple, Yelp, Twitter, and Wikimedia.\n\nFortunately, CISA isn\u2019t law yet, but it will have its final Senate vote this week and we need a dozen more senators to vote against it. Two things you can do right now:\n\n* [Call your lawmakers to vote no on the bill this week] (https://www.stopcyberspying.com) \n\n* [This is the fastest way to tweet at your senators](https://www.decidethefuture.org)\n\nOr just call this and we can connect you: 1-985-222-CISA \n\nAMA\n\n\nUPDATE: Our special guest and leading privacy advocate, Senator Wyden has joined the AMA. Please ask him questions! [Here's the proof](https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/658767505352171520).\n\nUPDATE 2(7:45 pm ET): Senator Wyden is now gone.\n\nAnswering questions today are: [JaycoxEFF](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/mark-m-jaycox), [nadia_k](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/nadia-kayyali), [NathanDavidWhite](https://www.accessnow.org/about/staff), [fightforthefuture](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/aboutus/#team), [evanfftf](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/aboutus/#team), [astepanovich](https://www.accessnow.org/about/staff), [DrewAccess](https://www.accessnow.org/about/staff), [DSchuma](https://demandprogress.org/policy/).\n\nProof it's us: [EFF](https://twitter.com/EFF/status/658680604544790528), [Access](https://twitter.com/accessnow/status/658653237608869888), [Fight for the Future]\n(https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/658709418809434113), [FFTF here also]\n(https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/658709418809434113), [Demand Progress](https://twitter.com/demandprogress/status/658679788119326720)\n\nYou can read about why the bill is dangerous [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/03/senate-intelligence-committee-advances-terrible-cybersecurity-bill-surveillance). You can also find out more in this [detailed chart](https://www.stopcyberspying.com/filebase/1431382367_Detailed_Bill_Analysis.pdf) (.pdf) comparing CISA to other bad cybersecurity bills.\n\nRead the actual bill text [here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/754).",

That's what happened to SOPA, so we know it's possible. The companies behind this would no doubt continue to try to sneak it through in some other form, but making Congress afraid to touch CISA or similar bills would be a huge step in the right direction.",

The bill strengthens protections for American consumers by requiring that companies who collect and store sensitive information take reasonable measures to ensure it remains private and secure.  Among other requirements, companies who store sensitive personal or financial information on 10,000 customers or more must meet consumer privacy and data security standards to keep this information safe, and notify the customer within 30 days in event of a breach.\n\n**2) S. 2089 American Energy Innovation Act,** Introduced by Senator Cantwell, and I\u2019m one of 29 original cosponsors. The bill is built around the proposition that the law ought to reward clean energy with incentives that spark innovation in the private economy. Among other provisions, the bill invests in improvements to grid-related cybersecurity, doubles investments in cybersecurity research, and develops and designates DOE as the sector-specific lead for energy.\n\n**3) Proposed increase in cybersecurity funding for the IRS.**  I\u2019ve supported doing more to keep Americans\u2019 tax information secure.  You can read more about this effort [here] (http://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/090215 Letter to IRS on Resources FINAL2.PDF).\n\nCongress still has a long way to go to craft a cybersecurity policy that keeps up with the digital threats our country is facing. Unlike CISA, though, these bills would at least move us in the right direction.",

Ideally, and we're working on this and I know EFF and others are too, we figure out ways people DO want to help out and be informed about what's happening, like with either a mobile app or other notifications, and to get your specific feedback about what you don't want to hear about and what you do want to hear about. As we're trying to win on some of the biggest issues of the day that must be won and fought on, we have to build a system and movement together, so we hope you'll help us do that by giving us ways that you do want to be in touch and pitch in with contacts to decisionmakers.

I'll start by saying that internally, EFF\n thinks carefully about respecting people's inboxes\u2014it's part of every\n discussion about email. But it's important to know that people don't\n feel that we're succeeding.\n\n What I think that this means is that we need to develop better tools\n for people to be able to tell us how often they want to receive\n emails\u2014the options that EFF has now are very rudimentary. We'll\n brainstorm some ideas\u2014I personally liked the granular, Steam-like\n options /u/No-Shit-Sherlock mentioned. And whatever we come up with will likely take time to implement!\n\n As far as we know, unsubscribes have been working fine. What typically happens when it fails is that we have multiple dfferent email\n addresses for a person, but we don't know that it's the same person so the unsubscribe works for the one email address, but we don't know to unsubscribe the others. If a bigger bug has occurred and we've emailed an address that should be unsubscribed, that's definitely unintentional and it'd be good to report so we can fix our tools. If you notice this, please let us know: information@eff.org\n\nThank you for continuing to follow us and support this work in other ways! ",

While information sharing may assist on security a small amount, the lobbying from the Chamber of Commerce and others has led each of these proposals down the same road - overbroad sharing provisions, broad corporate liability, a back-door to increased surveillance. \n\nThis partners with the recent major data breaches to create an environment where lawmakers feel the need to do \"something,\" and these information sharing bills come ready-made to be pushed through. Groups like Access Now and our partners have tried to promote alternative proposals that would actually have a much larger positive impact on security without privacy risks, and these are starting to get traction (see: https://www.accessnow.org/page/-/Veto-CISA-Coalition-Ltr.pdf), but not quickly enough.

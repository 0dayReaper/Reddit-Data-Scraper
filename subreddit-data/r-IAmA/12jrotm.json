    "postText": "Hello Reddit, I am very excited to be here for my first ever AMA. Over the last 50 years I have been an artist, architectural designer, inventor, teacher, gemologist, philanthropist, and photographer.\n\nYou can view all the different endeavors I have been involved in at [www.DouglasBusch.com](https://www.DouglasBusch.com)\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Illinois in 1973, I moved to California and worked as an assistant to Morley Baer and Al Weber along with assisting Ansel Adams wash prints on Portfolio VI. My work at [SuperLarge Photography](https://superlarge.com/) encompasses an array of subjects, including landscapes, cityscapes, nudes, portraits, and color and is part of the collections at the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Museum of Photographic Arts, San Diego, CA.\n\nMy imaginative eco-friendly, sustainable architectural work and drought-tolerant landscape designs have allowed me to work with many of my colleagues throughout California through my firm [Busch Design Build, Inc.](https://buschdesign.com) including designing the late [Bob Saget\u2019s home](https://www.cottagesgardens.com/late-bob-sagets-longtime-brentwood-home-changes-hands-in-an-off-market-deal/pic/311895/) and others featured in Los Angeles Times, Robb Report, and Malibu Times. Through [EcoTech Design Studio](https://ecotechdesignstudio.com) my vision for an eco think-tank, learning and demonstration center known as the [EcoPark](https://inhabitat.com/ecopark-in-malibu-gets-approval-to-build-eco-education-center/ecopark-14/) can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/yBzgA3O8zls) before it was lost in the Woolsey Fire in 2018.\n\nWith a dedication to the principles of healthy design and sustainable building I launched [pH Living: Healthy Housing Systems](https://phliving.us), with the goal of providing homes for people who suffer from environmental allergies and chemical sensitivities (MCS). I also developed the first modular, patented self-watering vertical gardening system designed for urban spaces offering an affordable organic herb and vegetable garden that can be used right out of the box called [Farm in a Box](https://thefarminabox.com/)\u2122.\n\nMy philanthropic work includes the [No-Strings Foundation](https://nostringsfoundation.org), where we provided no-strings-attached grants for photographers providing direct assistance to photographic image makers in an effort to facilitate and enhance their creative opportunities and endeavors.\n\nEarlier this year I publicly announced my legacy project that I have been working on for the past many years. The [Genos Center Foundation](https://genoscenter.org) is a 501(c)(3) registered nonprofit created to develop the Genos Center, a planned multicultural art gallery, non-denominational chapel and reflective gardens focused on eradicating genocides worldwide giving a voice to marginalized communities by raising awareness, promoting healing, and providing new perspectives on past and present issues.\n\nUpon completion we plan to donate the project in-full to an institution, foundation, or city where the exhibition and chapel buildings are located where it can be sited in perpetuity, to maintain evolving exhibitions and offer a public park destination via the gardens.\n\nThe mission of the Genos Center is to teach tolerance through the power of art inspiring reflection and allowing visitors to form new ties between their own current understanding of history and emotional subconscious.\n\nBefore 1944, the term \"genocide\" did not exist. Raphael Lemkin, a Polish-Jewish lawyer, crafted this special phrase to portray Nazi policies of deliberate extermination during the Holocaust.\n\nGenocide remains tragically overlooked in the public eye, so it's essential that we don't allow our words - \"Never again\" - to remain empty rhetoric. We must take tangible action and ensure that these powerful words become a reality.\n\nUnfortunately, those steps have not been taken and we have seen similar atrocities in Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda, Darfur, and Libya. Little has been done to address and promote a greater understanding of the causes and dynamics of genocide, such as ethnic cleansing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n\nOur vision is for visitors to see the artwork and the world from a new perspective. Through art we can raise awareness, understanding and promote healing as we recognize not only the past but the present. In the last century alone over 50 Million lives have been unjustly taken. If genocidal policies and colonialism continue, some groups of people will cease to exist.\n\nAsk Me Anything!\n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://twitter.com/GenosCenter/status/1643286250911064075)!\n\n**EDIT: Thank you all for the great questions, this was a very engaging 5 hours. Please do continue to leave any questions that you have as I will be coming back to this thread in the hours and days ahead so that we may keep the discussion going.**",

Make sure your exposures are good.  I use the zone system and I used to use the pentax spot meter but haven't used a meter in years.  I use one film, one developer, one paper etc. Thus, I keep it simple and I can now read the light for the film I use.  Hope that helps",

Your approach of keeping it as simple as you can is really interesting to me, and I guess unexpected.  But I can see how it would make one much more efficient.  Plus, once you find something that seems to be the best you can hope for, why not just go with it, and perfect the results you get with it.\n\nThank you very much, once again.",

When we started [pHLiving.us](https://pHLiving.us) which is the healthiest (sustainable was easy) housing system to help the MCS community we actually tested everything from the screws up.  We could not put our name on it if it was not as we stated.  I get the different initiatives and so many people and agencies trying to do the right thing but it is a holistic physical structure...they have to breath and control the environment inside and out.  I focus first on the air quality so we always have heat recovery ventilators in our homes to exchange and condition the air coming into the house every 2 hours.  No build up of gases, etc.  Then to inert products which do not offgas or contain VOCs, etc.  Aesthetic is important to me so the end product has to be pleasing to my eye and the spaces and volumes have to feel right.  hope that helps.",

I never printed my own negatives and wouldn't even know where to begin. But just thinking about your whole process of taking pictures has me in awe!\n\nHow much preparation goes into \"grabbing\" your camera and taking pictures? I mean it isn't just snatching a roll or two and strolling through the neighborhood, right? You obviously have to plan ahead what you want to photograph and how. How would you even meter film that large? Do you use available light or do you even try artificial lighting? So many questions I never thought about regarding large format photography.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on thinking about you working for Ansel Adams! How insane is that?",

I think the dicipline needs to be carried over.\nAll the shots I took with film I agree I did take a lot more time with and I think that's a large part of why I am happier with those shots, they do feel more precious because of the 'one chance to capture the moment' approach, and I did used to Frame a shot, and not bother taking it a lot as my heart wasnt in it. \n\nI will come back to film, I've been lucky to use and abuse many digital cameras and while they're technically incredible pieces of kit, there is a magic to film that cannot be found in digital.\n\nThanks for your reply!",

I prefer the 12x20, 14x17, and 20x24 view cameras because it slows me down enough to really see and decide what is important I am feeling.  I can set up a 12x20 and have an exposure off in 2 minutes but I see no reason to rush the shot.  I visualize the finished print before the exposure is made.  I only take one shot and don't take that until I am sure it is capturing what I felt in the original moment.  Commitment to the image comes through in my estimation.  \n\nTo answer your question though small cameras and even film seems to be coming back now.  They are all tools and it is the vision which sets your images apart.  Some like to shoot from the hip or like me; they prefer to look for the metaphor represented by the subject.  Hope that helps...bottom line they are all tools and your vision is your own.",

I wanted the nudes larger than one-to-one so I convinced Rodenstock to make me a lens and Koday supplied the film and paper.  I had to build a 2,200 sq. ft. darkroom to build sinks and trays to process.  Sundstrand Aviation and Northrop engineers were working on the stealth bomber in Rockford IL and they designed and built me a 20x24\" enlarger where I could control the light source to reduce or intensify light in any area of the negative.

I have no idea where it is going and it seems most the concepts I see for images are weak and not thought out or do not have real value to spend time viewing.

Each show would have a different international curator bringing a different vision then mine to educate myself, as well as, an international audience.  We have no preconceived communities but all should be given a voice.  This is why we want many different curators and artists from around the world.  A different vision than just one location and genocide.  Many visions, voices, and shedding light on all atrocities.  We have several curators we are in discussions with, as well as, international artists who want to be part of this ground breaking endeavor.

Leave the gallery over the water gardens (a cleansing ritual) into the Chapel to sit and enjoy the architecture and Contemplative Art Pieces allowing you to absorb what you saw: consciously or unconsciously.  You can then go into the sunken gardens and commune with nature and water.  I want it to be a holistic experience allowing you to spend the entire day if you choose.  All your senses should be awakened and partake.",

I did not want to create a \"museum\" but instead wanted to create a space for the audience to view the art exhibits, hear the artist speak about what he was trying to convey, and hopefully allow the audience to see the world in a different light.  I did not want them beat over the head.  To break one's own ignorance and see other cultures in a different light thus making us more inclusive.  Education through Art is my tool.  Learning tolerance and knowledge of the world around us and not be scared of what one does not understand.  I firmly believe in the \"Golden Rule.\"  Do unto others what you want done onto you.  Everyone should be able to live the life they want and not have others dictate how one should live.  If you don't harm anyone than who am I to say what is right or wrong.  I started studying cultures to see what I could learn and incorporate into my own life, as well as,  find understanding and not fear what I did not agree with.  The Chapel is for reflection similar to the Rothko Chapel in Houston.  Once one as gone through the art show and had a chance to hear from the artist or staff the \"Why\" they can then enjoy and reflect in the Chapel or gardens.  The hope is that one will see the world differently and not stay in our own bubbles.  There are museums and I wanted a different experience for the audience.  Education, understanding, and tolerance...enlightenment hopefully.  \n\nYes, I do want to donate it to a community to encourage the concept of \"Community\" and break the bonds of Ignorance but also wanted it to stay relevant to today and the future.  Ever changing and enlightening.",

    "postText": "I'm Steven Pruitt - Wikipedia user name Ser Amantio di Nicolao - and I was featured on CBS Saturday Morning a few weeks ago due to the fact that I'm the top editor, by edit count, on the English Wikipedia. Here's my user page:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ser\\_Amantio\\_di\\_Nicolao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ser_Amantio_di_Nicolao)\n\nSeveral people have asked me to do an AMA since the piece aired, and I'm happy to acquiesce...but today's really the first time I've had a free block of time to do one.\n\nI'll be here for the next couple of hours, and promise to try and answer as many questions as I can. I know y'all require proof: I hope this does it, otherwise I will have taken this totally useless selfie for nothing:[https://imgur.com/a/zJFpqN7](https://imgur.com/a/zJFpqN7)\n\nFire away!  \n\n\nEdit: OK, I'm going to start winding things down. I have to step away for a little while, and I'll try to answer some more questions before I go to bed, but otherwise that's that for now. Sorry if I haven't been able to get to your question. (I hesitate to add: you *can* always e-mail me through my user page. I don't bite unless provoked severely.)",

I'm not sure I believed the \"anyone can edit\" part of it until I became part of \"everyone\".",

On the plus side, they're probably the biggest non profit for fighting for free and open information today.",

I'm not saying he absolutely shouldn't, but the idea of Wikipedia is to crowdsource intellectual labor from disinterested parties - like Steven who only work for a public benefit. It's in the publics best interest to have an online free encyclopedia, but will the public do it without incentives? The answer so far is amazingly yes, which is why Steven says he is helping to change the way the world thinks about knowledge, and it blows his mind still. Wikipedia is THE best evidence that an intellectual property for the good of society can be created with no incentives. That's revolutionary. When contributors take money to do the work then it maybe becomes something less. ",

Such a user would be blocked almost immediately. If it were just straightforward vandalism you would report them to [WP:AIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrator_intervention_against_vandalism) or [WP:ANI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents) (the latter for more complex situations) and they would be blocked. If they keep coming back with alternate accounts (sockpuppets) you can take them to [WP:SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations) and potentially get their IP range blocked from account creation. \n\n  There are more subtly problematic users though, and dealing with them may involve [arbitration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee) and [sanctions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editing_restrictions). I remember one guy in particular (~~not going to name names~~ changed my mind, see below) who was mostly active on literature-related articles. He was an extremely knowledgeable and capable researcher but was also extremely opinionated and combative. He ended up getting banned for harassing other users and coordinating the harassment off-site. Hilariously enough he was unbanned years later on the condition that he was only allowed to edit a single article.\n\n   [There's a rogue's gallery of the more straightforward trolls who keep coming back if you're interested,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Long-term_abuse/List) (note that the names link to more detailed case studies) and there's also [a list of the lamest editing conflicts between users.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars)\n\n2. This depends. The creation of individual articles is mostly solo, I would say, while improvement of articles is a group effort, especially if the plan is to steer it toward a featured article review. Getting an article to FA status is a big endeavor and usually takes a team of around half a dozen editors. Often you'll know a bunch of editors who are interested in the same subjects you are from running into them on other articles. If you were looking to get an article to FA you might go around to their user talk pages and drop feelers, or you might go to the talk page of a related WikiProject (For instance the [WPVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Visual_arts)) in order to get the attention of its members. The roles the individual editors take are ad-hoc and any coordination is hashed out on talk pages. \n\n  For instance, when I was part of the team that was working the article on the German painter [Caspar David Friedrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_David_Friedrich) up to FA status my main goal was to hunt down high quality images from museum websites, to stub out redlinks in the article by translating the relevant articles on his individual paintings from the German Wikipedia, and to [fill out a list of his works as much as possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Caspar_David_Friedrich). \n\n  So while I was creating individual articles on my own in this example, like [*The Sea of Ice*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_of_Ice), [*The Stages of Life*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stages_of_Life), and [*The Monk by the Sea*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monk_by_the_Sea), these were created as part of a larger, overarching project that was coordinated between a larger community.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the platinum! Shout-outs to my old WPVA buddies - Ceoil, Modernist, Johnbod, JNW, Kafka Liz, Uyvsdi, and Victoriaearle! \n\nEdit 2: You know what, fuck it, the user who got themselves banned for being an asshole was [Ottava Rima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ottava_Rima). I'm calling him out because I just remembered he listed my article [William Blake's Illustrations of *On the Morning of Christ's Nativity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake%27s_illustrations_of_On_the_Morning_of_Christ%27s_Nativity) on his userpage as an article he had written despite [this single (not particularly helpful) sentence being his sole contribution to it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Blake%27s_illustrations_of_On_the_Morning_of_Christ%27s_Nativity&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=259248256&amp;oldid=259245355) Fuck you Ottava.\n   ",

Here was a woman that had every right to complain at the Fates over her  lot in life...she was abandoned by her parents to an orphanage, and she  battled health issues for many years before dying of cancer at 55. (I  remember reading that selfsame article about her and being amazed at  what she had overcome.) And yet she remained ever gracious in her career  and her professional dealings. The writer of the article, I remember,  recalled assisting in a Metropolitan Opera performance of [*Giulio Cesare in Egitto*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Cesare_in_Egitto), in which [Kathleen Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Battle) was singing. Battle was then in the throes of some of her worst behavior, and she was *really*  letting people have it over trivial matters. And the writer said that  when the curtain fell, he was about ready to tell her off, when he felt a  tug at his elbow. It was Troyanos - she took him aside, smiled, and  said, \"Don't. It doesn't matter.\"   \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It  can be so tempting to get wound up over the least little thing around  here. But every time I do, somewhere in the dark recesses of my  mind...so deep that I *feel* her presence rather than hear it...I'm  sure Troyanos is reminding me, too: \"It doesn't matter.\" If she, with  all that she overcame, could say it, then I damn well can, too.",

I like starting with an encyclopedia entry because it shows me that someone else has already deemed the topic notable. I'll turn to web sources, too - anything that helps me flesh a subject out. Although that's tricky for older subjects...sometimes the only material is available in undigitized books, for instance.  \n\n\nBut I'll use anything, so long as it passes the smell test. :-)",

I\u2019m a classically trained cellist and keep my keyboard in my lap which sets me up to apply some of my cello-playing ergonomic know-how.  That may or may not work for you depending on your chair height, arm length, etc.\n\nBig picture: \n\nFingers do the least amount of work and should just be lifted and dropped, transferring power from bigger muscles (keep fingers in a curved, relaxed position so they\u2019re resting but at the ready); and,\n\nYou want to avoid having a mountain or a valley shape at your wrist.  When there is no dip or bend in your wrists, then you don\u2019t break the flow of muscle-power coming from your back into your hands, which is a huge help in avoiding repetitive use injury.  Try to make it possible for an imaginary drop of water to flow from your shoulder to your knuckles.  \n\nBe mindful of screen height, back support, nail length, etc., and you got a stew goin\u2019.  Use your mouse as sparingly as you can, and get a tiny one that fits comfortably in the curve of your fingertips.  \n\n70 hours of typing a week for 10 years and 25 years of cello-playing, and I haven\u2019t had any issues.",

She's only the second American woman sculptor I've encountered born in the eighteenth century (the other being Patience Wright: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience\\_Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience_Wright)), and I'd never heard of her. Never seen her work. Never studied her, and I took a class on nineteenth-century American art in college. I thought she was a copyright trap before I started reading up on her. It's so interesting to me that she was unable to break through when Harriet Hosmer, Edmonia Lewis, or Anne Whitney did. And I was glad to be able to write her back into the history books, as it were. :-)",

For instance: I just purchased a dictionary of American folk art, and there are multiple entries in there for fraktur artists. (See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur\\_(folk\\_art)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraktur_(folk_art)) for more.) I'm looking forward to writing them up...I don't believe there's a traditional general-interest encyclopedia out there which contains multiple entries for fraktur artists. Or shape-note composers, or notable Shakers, or other such figures...  \n\n\nDoes that make sense? It's not just about expanding the historical record, for me - it's about having fun with taxonomy.

I'm still dealing with the effects of the abuse I endured in the SO. I just want to say thank you for being brave and outspoken. I feel like even when people are rightly negative about Scn, they still don't really get it, and it's difficult to talk about. So, thank you for doing what you're doing, and for being an example for someone that gets it.  What has helped you get through the leaving process and the intimidation from the church?\n\n",

You\u2019re supposed to give as much money as they can get from you.\n\nMike Rinder: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJeffrey Augustine: There\u2019s no end to the amount of money they will take. If you\u2019re a public member, paying to get auditing to go from the beginning all the way up to OT8, the generally accepted number is about $360,000. \n\nLeah: So how do people do it who are not rich?\n\nJeffrey Augustine: They take out second and third mortgages on their homes or they live in apartments. They drive really crappy cars. If you ever go to a Scientology event, you will see a few wealthy cars and everything else are old cars. You sacrifice. You work extra jobs and you go without. \n\nLeah: Good point. You go without. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so painful. People are giving up living to finance their actual religion.\n\nJeffrey Augustine: L. Ron Hubbard said there\u2019s nothing more valuable than Scientology. You\u2019re asked to give up your retirement funds and college funds for your children. This is insane. ",

The truth is that the press should do a much better job at investigating.\n\nI think it is interesting though, because this is largely how some politicians work.  The mainstream press has been looking down their noses at certain politicians, so the politicians convince their followers that everybody in the media is a liar with an agenda.  Pretty soon, it doesn't matter what the press publishes, the followers are programmed to just not believe it.\n\nIn both cases, I think the press inflicts a wound on itself and enables those who want to brainwash people not to pay attention to the media.",

The hole is the place where people at the international base were kept 24/7 under guard. There was a big conference room that had a big table in it and the carpet there was industrial strength carpet and people, myself included, were made to crawl around on their hands and knees around this big table and eventually your hands become bloodied and your knees become bloodied and the next day you\u2019re doing it again, so it never really heals. I still have a little scar on my left knee from doing that.\n\nLeah: And that was just usual? That was just everyday?\n\nMike Rinder: Yeah.\n\nLeah: Other than being punched and slapped and ridiculed?\n\nMike Rinder: Yup.\n\nLeah: When I was in Scientology, I used to hear information about Sea Org members saying that they were abused. I remember thinking if that were true then the police would be raiding this place and the FBI would be doing something. If this were true, how come no one has done anything about it? And I want you to talk about that.\n\nMike Rinder: The primary reason is because people within in Scientology are indoctrinated heavily. The law enforcement, the FBI, the police, they\u2019re all horrible, suppressive people. So, the concept of even going to them is something that just never enters the mind of a Scientologist. \n\nLeah: Not to mention, your doctrine says if you prosecute a Scientologist, you will be expelled and shunned. So, there\u2019s the fear of losing your family and everything you\u2019ve ever known.\n\nMike Rinder: I actually wrote an article on my blog that is called \u201c[Dealing with Critics of Scientology \u2013 The L. Ron Hubbard Playbook](http://www.mikerindersblog.org/dealing-with-critics-of-scientology-the-l-ron-hubbard-playbook/).\u201d It has all of these documents in there.\n\nLeah: I want people to see this! I don\u2019t want to be just like Scientology and say, \u201cBelieve me.\u201d I don\u2019t need you to believe me. I need you to google it yourself. \n\nMike Rinder: I need you to believe Scientology. Go look at their stuff. \n\nLeah: Go look at their policies. Go google \u201cScientology and disconnection,\u201d \u201cScientology and coerced abortions,\u201d \u201cScientology and physical and mental abuse.\u201d Just google it! Make your own decisions. I\u2019m doing exactly the opposite of what the \u201cChurch\u201d will tell its parishioners. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sweating. That\u2019s the thing, I get so passionate about everything that I talk about that I start sweating just saying one thing.  ",

Also, cult programming can become more powerful than even the bond between parents and children.\n\n2. Your loved ones do not see you as the good guy. The cult has made sure of this, by convincing its victims that anyone who is skeptical of the religion is evil, and that people who are actually against the religion are evil incarnate. Try not to take it personally coming from your parents. They have a powerful economic incentive to keep people believing, and will lie, cheat and scam as much as necessary.\n\n3.

They won't look at cases to decide its a religion. They have to separate and look at the law. Your doctrine is abusive. It mandates that you abuse people. ",

Should be good for a laugh, right?  Get to the cinema, sold out.  That's weird.  This is a stadium seating multi-plex and the film has *got* to be terrible.\n\nSo we bought tickets to something else, I think the Little Mermaid was having a re-release or something.  Then just mosey on into the   Battlefield theater.  It's empty.  I'm talking not a single other person.  Well that's a little creepy, but whatever.  We grab some seats.\n\nAbout 5 minutes before showtime, the doors open and in they come.  Tons of scientologists.  Enough to fill the place.  We obviously didn't come with them, they know they bought every single ticket, and we clearly don't belong.\n\nThey didn't say anything to us though.  They just filed in and took every seat in there.  I was pretty sure that I wasn't going to disappear, never to be heard from again.  But then again, it didn't seem entirely outside the realm of possibility.  Anytime there was a bright light in the movie, an explosion or something, I could always see at least a few pair of eyes watching us rather than the screen.\n\nIn retrospect, since I'm still here, that was one of the coolest movie experiences I've ever had.",

Ask the LAPD. \n\nEdit: \n\nMike Rinder: For a long time, Shelly was at a property that is owned by one of the Church corporations near Lake Arrowhead here in California, and she was sent there when she displeased David Miscavige.\n\nLeah: Why?\n\nMike Rinder: Shelly was privy to everything that went on with Dave. \n\nLeah: Which is why I filed my police report. \n\nMike Rinder: Of course, because she vanished.\n\nLeah: Which, by the way, I\u2019m still following up on because there are still answers that I need. I do not know that she is alive. I do not know that she\u2019s not being held against her will. I do not know these things. So, if the \u201cChurch\u201d produces her by bringing her to an event, even if she went on a program and said, \u201cHi, Leah Remini, go f**k yourself,\u201d I\u2019d be happy to know that she was alive. The police department should say, \u201cYes, we\u2019ve seen her.\u201d I wasn\u2019t told that. I was told that a representative saw her or spoke to her. \n\nMike Rinder: That is what they managed to convince the LAPD of. But then, when you have got a lot of money, you can go hire people who are influence peddlers. And those influence peddlers can peddle influence wherever you want them to, if you pay enough money. \n\nLeah: Well, I don\u2019t have that kind of money, but I do have you and I do have you at home, and we should probably end on that note.

The UltraBarrier spikes are sharp as can be and dangerous as hell, and point both in and outwards. Even the manufacturer has strong words about their product.\n\n&gt;[UltraBarrier is the ultimate psychological and physical barrier, providing unsurpassed security, without the concentration camp appearance of barbed wire](http://www.ultrabarrier.com/applications.php).\n\nIt's arguable that this is the closest publicly-known thing to an internment / concentration camp / [black site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_site) on US soil, [especially since there have been allegations of human trafficking out of it for over a decade now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hole_\\(Scientology\\)#Headley_et_al._v._Church_of_Scientology_International_et_al.), and when you read about [the abuses that happened in the Hole to former Scientology executives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hole_\\(Scientology\\)#Life_in_the_Hole)? David Miscavige is a sick, twisted short little sadist.\n\nAlso, [all critical documents, such as passports, birth certificates, and the like, are kept in locked filing cabinets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Base#At_the_bottom) and [not released without authority from upper-level executives](https://markrathbun.wordpress.com/2010/06/06/the-citadel/), and even then, anyone who leaves has to go through a [security check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scientology_security_checks) beforehand, up to and including extensive auditing (interrogation / confessional). Some members have had to [steal their passports back](http://www.xenu-directory.net/accounts/nefertiti199705.html) or use [false pretenses to get them](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Marc_Headley_speech_at_That_is_Scientology!_Reports_from_the_USA).\n\n-----\n\n**EDIT:** It's also possible she's at [Trementina Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trementina_Base) in New Mexico. These are some of the highest-security areas that Scientology has to offer.\n\nThe Freewinds is mobile and goes from port to port. That would conveniently keep Shelley remote and out of reach. The Hole, however, would let her be produced whenever she needed to be trotted out to law enforcement. Trementina is a bit more unlikely, as it's REALLY remote, though it would ensure she couldn't escape easily (then again, Gold Base has [razor wire and spikes on their external fence that point IN as well as out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hole_\\(Scientology\\)#/media/File:Fence_blades_fgnd_focus.jpg), so...).\n\n-----\n\n**EDIT EDIT:** It's also possible she's at the [Twin Peaks compound](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2489172/Exclusive-pictures-secret-Californian-Scientology-base-Shelly-Miscavage-lives.html). [This is probably the most secret and restricted area outside of Trementina Base](http://la.curbed.com/2013/11/7/10178216/here-are-photos-of-scientologys-super-secret-armageddon-compound-in), and it's locked down tighter than a catamite's rectum.\n\nA Redditor worked there a few years back and [posted a thread about it](https://np.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/31flmx/a_few_years_ago_i_worked_at_the_secret_doomsday/).\n\nAnd [here's a drone flyover of the installation](http://tonyortega.org/2016/09/14/drone-flyover-scientologys-secret-base-where-david-miscavige-keeps-wife-out-of-sight/).\n\nIf you're willing to deal with Angry Gay Pope's bombast, [he actually covers the base pretty decently](http://angrygaypope.com/twin_peaks/index.html).",

The AMA, and APA, and all \"governments\" do not give scientology its due because they have a vested interest in not healing people and not helping people. And Scientology is in the business of making people better. So Scientologists are taught that their safest bet is to get their info from the only true decent people...and those are Scientologists. And if they look on the internet, if they read time mag, they will be met with punishment at their expense. And, as a Scientologist...you have to confess that you've read outside materials, and that will be met with punishment at your expense. ",

In addition, I am aware the 'church' is against psychology; how was this opposition demonstrated within or by the 'church'?  Finally, in your opinion how prevalent are mental health difficulties with the Scientology community?\n\nThank you for your time.",

They promote that you can heal your psycho-sematic issues with their \"technology.\" They will get in the way of people taking medications. They will prevent people from getting the real medical help that they need. and in some cases have caused suicides because of it. Scientology is mentally abusive because we are all taught that we are responsible for everything. ",

I know of one celeb who had a sea org member working in their home and sea org members were averaging $25/week. The labor laws don't apply to any church therefor they were made to work ungodly hours, forced into interrogations if making human mistakes around the celebrity. ",

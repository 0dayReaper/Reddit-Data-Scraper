    "postText": "Hallo Reddit, John Cleese here. I am best known for writing and starring in Monty Python. I am currently in America and will be spending some of the fall this year zooming around doing live appearances on my Monty Python and the Holy Grail Tour.\n\nMy first show is September 19th at the State Theatre in Easton, PA. \nCheck out all the dates and locations: http://www.montypython.com/news_jchg2017/422 #CleeseLiveOnStage\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/JohnCleese/status/907997520265084931\nMore Proof: https://i.redd.it/5ufvhz92p2mz.jpg\n\nEDIT:\nThank you for the wonderful, meaningless conversation. If you like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, come and see me on my tour. If you don't, get in a pedal bin and jump off a cliff.",

Is this true, and did it cause any production issues?",

I'd like to start with the usual 'thank you's' and say I've been an admirer of your work since I was about 9 years old and of all the comics around, you probably made me laugh the most and Fawlty Towers never failed to cheer me up even during the most difficult times. That's the first big thank you. But what's so interesting about you is that besides the fact that you are a very skilled performer, both verbal and physical, you've always been a writer who performs his own material. And it's very clear you always took great care to the writing before it got on the screen. \n\nI've seen some of your lectures on creativity. You've not only found a very captivating way of explaining your theories on creativity but it's also completely accurate. I had been writing for some years before I discovered your method of the tortoise enclosure and discovered that it truly made a huge difference. So thank you for all that and much much more!\n\nI've always wondered about the writing within Monty Python. I know you did your usual Python writing with Graham Chapman, but you also wrote some material with (at least) Michael Palin and Eric Idle. I don't know if you wrote things with Terry Jones. You've talked alot about what it was like to write with Graham, but what was it like for you to write with the others and was your role in those combinations a very different one from the one you had with Graham?\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to do this and I hope you're having a lovely day.",

Eric and I wrote Sir George Head climbing the twin peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro, and Michael and I wrote Mr. Hilter standing in the Minehead bye-election. \nNevertheless we drifted back into our original pairings, and I don\u2019t know why. Maybe Chapman was the only one who liked writing with me. \nI think it was a shame, I think we would\u2019ve been even more inventive if we mixed the writing teams up a bit. ",

When my dad told me Python-jokes were very clever and that the writers all had gone to university etc that's when I knew I needed to get grades good enough to get in to college. So thank you for that!\n\nMy question is. I once saw an interview where you spoke very lovingly of your mother and I somehow got the feeling that the humour in Python was very close knit to your mothers \"approval\" in the sense that your boundaries of your humour was as far as you could go without getting a thrashing from your mothers. Did you all know each other's mothers/parents and was there anyone of them more strict than the other? Like \"If we do this Erics mother is going to kill us\"?",

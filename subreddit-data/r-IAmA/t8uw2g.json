                    "comment": "I have a question if it\u2019s not too late:  \n  \nAre you aware of the dangerously insidious EARN IT Act?  \n  \nIt\u2019s a bill that has heavy mass surveillance and censorship intentions by intending to attack encryption, but is disguised under the pretense of protecting children that is being pushed through the Senate under everyone\u2019s noses.  \n  \nMy concern is that the way the bill handles encryption, it will end up making our sites vulnerable to cyber attacks, since our online data and sites, including those of the stock market, online banking, cryptocurrency etc. depend on encryption in order to remain secure.  \n  \nThis bill is attempting to put back doors in sites under the pretense of protecting children, but it would also leave these sites more vulnerable.  \n  \nOther flaws include:  \n  \n* it could pose a serious danger to Ukrainian Refugees and other such groups from oppressed nations, given that encryption is necessary for those using social media and the internet in general to help them flee from oppressive regimes. Without encryption, they\u2019re horrifically vulnerable to being found and targeted.\n  \n* there\u2019s a high chance that LGBT and race-related content will be targeted and censored, since the bill is being pushed by a known fundamentalist Hate Group called NCOSE (formerly known as Morality in Media). The commission that would be set up by this bill is called NCOSEP, which suggests they\u2019d have a strong influence on whoever is chosen to sit on said committee. If you're part of any LGBT groups, whether it be a fandom, a support group, or even just posting anything related to LGBT or racial content, THEY CAN CENSOR IT against your will. They can choose to silence you just because you saying anything LGBT related, being LGBT might be \"unsafe for kids\". And given the kind of people pushing this, who's to say they won't find loopholes or excuses to expand that definition to include other things that we take for granted? Like NSFW content, or just simply having views that contradict what they consider to be \"correct\"?  \n  \n* [And (ironically), not only making the internet LESS safe for kids, but also making the internet and government less able to deal with child and sexual predators.](https://slate.com/technology/2022/02/earn-it-act-fourth-amendment-violation.html) By letting third parties spy on kids' most private thoughts and photos, they are basically making it much easier for child abuse to occur, making it much easier for predators online to find and target these kids. And by forcing websites to become state actors and collect CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material), they basically make that evidence completely inadmissible in court due to violating the fourth amendment (unreasonable/unlawful search and seizure). Which means that sexual predators are more likely to run free.\n\nThese are the tags associated with this on Twitter: #EarnItAct #StopTheEARNITAct2022 #STOPTHEEARNITACT #StopTheEARNITAAct2022\n\n[https://www.noearnitact.org/](https://www.noearnitact.org/)\n\n[https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/oppose-earn-it-act/](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/oppose-earn-it-act/)\n\n[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/02/activists-writers-and-security-experts-all-oppose-earn-it-act](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/02/activists-writers-and-security-experts-all-oppose-earn-it-act)\n\n[https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20220201/11235048400/senators-myths-facts-about-earn-it-is-mostly-myths-not-facts.shtml](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20220201/11235048400/senators-myths-facts-about-earn-it-is-mostly-myths-not-facts.shtml)\n\nAlso turns out the guy who pushes this bill admits that this is about undermining encryption: [https://www.inputmag.com/culture/earn-it-act-lawmaker-admits-bill-is-targeting-encryption/](https://www.inputmag.com/culture/earn-it-act-lawmaker-admits-bill-is-targeting-encryption/)",

Let me explain why and what the alternative looks like.\n\nSo first of all index funds are a big category. Many of them are industry or country specific. It would be fucked up if, for instance, Congress bought up a travel ETF then lifted Covid restrictions. So let's assume that what you really mean is super broad (IE SPY) ETFs.\n\nNow, the assumption here is that the S&amp;P500 going up us good, and as a result Congress is fine if it has to keep it high. This is not true. Plenty of good policies might reduce the value of the market. For instance, increase the capital gains tax, reducing corporate welfare, approving a more hawkish fed chair, etc. Even stuff liberals might like (IE build back better) should not be passed if the reasoning is that we can transfer tax payer dollars to stock market value to keep Congress rich.\n\nTl;Dr is Congress directly controls the value of the market. Not all of the policies that increase the value of the market are inherently good. Incentives of letting them hold long or short positions in ETFs are bad.\n\nWhat you actually do is let them either hold a blind trust or just pay a fixed cash, inflation indexed pension unrelated to the value of securities. They don't know if they are long or short the market, they don't know if a law will help or hurt them, and for the life of their time in Congress, they cannot be appraised of its performance, as that would let them back out what's in it.\n\nHowever none of this gets to the root of the problem. The problem is that our democracy has become so removed that voting cannot hold elected officials accountable for something that is obviously outrageous and unpopular. Neither democratic nor Republican voters like this... And yet here we are.",

When you look at how the market reacted after that do you think Dodd Frank went far enough or do you think the market could be regulated better? What would you like to see done to prevent a future foolish market collapse?",

The ideas behind Dodd-Frank were well-intentioned and some of the practices of collateralization and not being so over leveraged worked well, but it wasn\u2019t a thousand pages because poor people and the regular investors who had been so hurt in the 2008 collapse wanted more complexity. This shit has to be simplified if we\u2019re going to get more transparent and efficient markets and have a better handle on boom and bust. Also, there was no individual accountability for those that very clearly and very purposefully defrauded investors and the economy.",

I imagine I\u2019ll get more out of this today than you all will but I welcome the chance to have the discussion and hopefully whatever animosities exist in these communities that have made a group discussion here impossible, will be minimized towards this higher goal. But if not, know I\u2019ll be watching with my very own eating popcorn GIF.",

You yourself have evolved through your career, and your new show \u201cThe Problem\u201d is proof of your evolution and advocacy.\n\nWe\u2019ve played the game. Won some, lost some. We\u2019ve done the due diligence. Tried different ways. I\u2019m a firm believer of direct registration of shares (DRS) but ultimately think it\u2019s up to lawmakers to make the system serve Main Street instead of Wall Street.\n\nYour experience fighting for the 9/11 First Responders Fund shows us how arduous the process can be. Wall Street lobbyist have first mover and home court advantage. How can we evolve into something that can substantiate change? (Better answer than \u201cgo vote\u201d)\n\nDo you see this as a slow fight? Or do you see the systemic risk we\u2019ve uncovered leading to a collapse and something else (decentralized finance) taking its place?\n\nTo the moon!\n\nImage Credit to u/relatable_yak",

What they don\u2019t tell you is there will be very powerful forces trying to bend it back. Even incremental change in a positive direction for a fairer market is arduous but worthwhile. Building those coalitions and having the clarity of vision and tenacity of temperament to see them through is an enormous challenge. So when I say stamina, I don\u2019t mean investing strategies. I mean the larger goal of creating a free market system that is more efficient at generating wealth at all levels, not just the top, and minimizing the collateral damage for those caught in its wake, not just a protection racket for those whose carelessness creates so much of the hazard. What you guys are doing is brilliant and important and fragile. Your voices, the voices of the average investor, have shifted the conversation in positive ways. Don\u2019t let the institutions speak for you. Looking forward to seeing what happens next!",

The bad guys are powerful, corrupt, can change the rules.... well this is EXACTLY what gamers have trained their whole lives for! We're conditioned to expect that long story arc, and to coalesce into teams that will do whatever it takes to win. The danger isn't that gamification will make 'dumb money' lose more, it's that gamers will do utterly incredible things (like logging over a billion dollars worth of DRSed GameStop shares so far) and that their eventual victory may be so complete that it breaks the system. This should be obvious given the systemic fragility exposed in January last year.",

Currently, under the DTCC, when you purchase shares from a broker, you are labeled as a \"beneficial owner\" of these securities, but your broker actually owns the shares in their name. \n\nIf shares are in the brokers name, there is no telling what they do with it. If they lend your securities (for shorting), there is NO WAY for you to stop it, or even tell if it's happening. \n\nDRS moves your shares from your brokers name to your social security number. When you DRS, your shares are not able to be lent, and you have complete and total control of what happens to them. \n\nHow to DRS - call up your broker and tell them you would like to direct register your shares with the transfer agent of said company (each company can have a different transfer agent, you'll need to look yours up on google). Transfers to DRS should take no more than 2 weeks.",

After SEC spent 15+ years shutting down attempts to investigate complaints that came in\n\nEdit: didnt expect this many upvotes so I add the following\n\nSpecial News Bonus: \n\nBernie Madoff\u2019s niece Shana Madoff was his rules and compliance officer and attorney. Wait for it. During one of the many early complaints that came in on Madoff, Eric Swanson was deliberate in telling the branch chief of SEC's Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) to stop investigating Madoff. We follow SEC boss Eric and what do we find? Two years later **SEC boss Eric Swanson marries Shana Madoff, the compliance officer and attorney for Madoff** . And it was _several years_ after this, that Madoff turned himself in namely, he told his sons and they turned him in. So there\u2019s that. Any retroactive consequences for Eric for his decisions while he was employed with the SEC. Nah. Bet instead he secured a great severance package tho. **WallSt is an organized crime unit**",

This is the most important question I would like to see answered.\n\nApes have done the work researching how the market works (or doesn\u2019t). Jon is an advocate, but not a market expert. What he DOES have experience with is how Congress works, and how to get them to listen to us.\n\nThis is where the focus of this AMA needs to be. We need to be asking Jon how we can best advocate for the changes we need Congress to make.\n\nI jumped on Reddit in January 2021 hoping to make some quick money on a short squeeze. Fourteen months later, here we are, having ripped the markets wide open and we\u2019re not done yet. We\u2019ve realized there need to be fundamental changes, and we need to demand them from Congress.",

            "comment": "Probably a bit late now but have you heard of \"Zombiestocks\" and the phenomenon of cellar boxing?\n\nRedditors have not only noticed that GameStop was running up every quarter in somewhat predictable intervals, as well as connected memestocks but there were also what we call \"Zombiestocks\" that were also running up at the same time that retailers have no access to: We're talking Sears, Toys'R'Us, cancer pharmaceutical companies etc. That were not trading on the open market anymore because they were worth less than $1.\n\nThe theory is that these companies were \"cellar boxed\" which means Hedgefunds kept shorting companies down to the lowest price it can possibly go (the cellar). At that point some weird magic happens with the bid ask spread that makes it almost impossible to get the price back up. When this happens the shorter has hit the bankruptcy jackpot, since the stock is not trading on the open market anymore, the shorters are not required to buy back the shares they borrowed to short. If they don't buy back the shares, they never close out their positions. If they never close out their positions, they never officially made a profit and if they never officially made a profit, they don't have to pay taxes. In video games, we call this an infinite money glitch.\n\nAnyways, this has happened to a lot of companies in the past (most notoriously competitors of Amazon) and it was going to happen to GameStop if those dreaded kids (Keith Gill) hadn't noticed that GameStop was way undervalued for a company that made hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.\n\nEDIT: Here's a link to a medium article that explains the whole cellar boxing bid ask spread magic because I'm a crayon eating smooth brained ape who can only explain it by calling it magic https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/cellar-boxing-the-predatory-secret-that-wall-street-uses-to-exploit-an-infinite-money-glitch-in-97ccbd6c9923",

            "comment": "Hey Jon,\r  \n\r  \nOne of the most unique aspects of the situation we currently find ourselves embroiled in is the idea of direct registering our shares. As I am sure you encountered during the research you and your team did for your show, naked shorting and synthetic share creation is incredibly hard to prove. One might even wonder if this is intentional. When pouring through the data we basically see the shadow cast by an invisible colossus yet when we try and point this out to the rest of the world we are labeled conspiracy theorists. This is of course after GME had a publicly reported short interest greater than the float and an SEC investigation basically laid out that the price run up last year was not due to shorts covering.\r  \n\r  \nWe have found that by directly registering shares in our name (DRS) and removing them from the DTC (a vestigial middleman from the days of physical stock certificates) we are able to not only prevent our shares from being loaned out for shorting under any circumstances but also publicly show how many shares retail really owns.\r  \n\r  \nIt has been theorized through countless methods that retail investors already own multiple publicly traded floats in GameStop. This community of investors has largely just been buying and holding for over a year. We don't swing trade, we don't sell yet every day we continue to see that our buys do not impact price discovery. Our trades are internalized and routed to dark pools while algorithmic traders continue to short, order book spoof and use any method possible to suppress the price.\r  \n\r  \nThe reason we continue to DRS is to \"take our ball and go home\" since we have realized the opposing team AND the referees have stacked the book against us. After 3 worthless congressional hearings, a toothless SEC investigation and literally thousands of corporate media articles telling us to \"Forget GameStop\" this seems to be our only recourse.\r  \n\r  \nI am curious why direct registration was not covered in your episode and what you personally think of the idea. According to the tally on the site https://www.computershared.net/ it is estimated we have locked up almost 30% of the float already just by spreading the word here on our little subreddit. That's 10 million shares of GME direct registered to only 130k retail investors.\r  \n\r  \nWe are the crazy ones who spend all day on reddit and have easy access to this information. There are still millions of retail investors who do not frequent this site and are completely unaware that the shares they think they own are little more than an I.O.U. with their broker. Corporate media has refused to cover this particular subject in any way even though it has been the most discussed topic within the GME community for months.\r  \n\r  \nWhat do we need to do to get the public aware of this? It seems like a home run of a story right? Frustrated investors are tired of seeing the company they love manipulated and so they decided to buck the system! Any thoughts or tips you can share on getting this info out there would be extremely valuable to us.\r  \n\r  \n**TLDR: How do we better inform the public of the value and necessity of directly registering their shares in their own name rather then entrusting them to brokers who have shown a willingness to take historically unprecedented steps to ensure retail never wins.**\r  \n\r  \nThank you for your time",

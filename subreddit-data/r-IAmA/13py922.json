We'll continue to build on our reporting of generative AI, such as this story about how** [**scammers have used AI**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/05/ai-voice-scam/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=reddit.com)**, as the technology develops. For more Washington Post stories on artificial intelligence, click** [**here**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/innovations/)**.**\n\nI\u2019m Pranshu Verma, a reporter on The Washington Post's technology team. I cover the innovations fueling tomorrow and the dark side of technology. I recently wrote a piece about how advances in generative artificial intelligence have put voice actors in a particularly precarious position. Some voice actors have even told The Post that they may abandon their careers because of this developing technology. You can read my story here: [https://wapo.st/3pBRGfz](https://wapo.st/3pBRGfz).\n\nI\u2019m Amanda Morris, a disability reporter for The Washington Post. For my latest story, I spoke with ALS patients, who use artificial intelligence to re-create their voices that may have otherwise been lost to the disease.

Part of it depends on how good the recordings used to clone someone\u2019s voice are \u2014 whether they\u2019re clear, crisp, and the person is speaking consistently in a way that is easily read by AI \u2014 as well as what sort of equipment they used to record themselves. Another part of it depends on what company you use and exactly how much input you give the computer. Generally, if someone records more sentences/phrases, they have gotten better results, but not always. I\u2019ve interviewed people who thought that their re-created voice sounded terrible with one company, but loved how it sounded with another. It probably also depends on what sort of data a company has on different accents and types of speakers. One company might have a great algorithm for British accents but might not have a good algorithm for Irish accents.  \n\n\nAnd, there\u2019s still a long way to go in terms of getting synthetic voices to mimic emotion or natural cadence in speech. ALS patients who use the technology said it still felt more robotic, even though it sounded more like them. They\u2019re hopeful that the technology gets better in the future so that they can sound even more like themselves, and possibly use AI-generated voices that can express emotions like sarcasm, sadness or excitement. \u2014 Amanda",

Many AI voice experts acknowledge that AI voice cloning software is much better now than it was even one or two years ago. But they also say it\u2019s not perfect \u2014 with some scientists telling me it\u2019s \u201c80 percent there,\u201d and there\u2019s still room to go in creating the perfect clone (if that\u2019s even possible). People who\u2019ve had their voice cloned still say their replicated voices sound robotic \u201cand just not like me.\u201d  \n\n\nExperts predict in the next few years we could get that number up to \u201c90 percent,\u201d but that would require a few things to happen: we\u2019d need more training data, which in this case are libraries of voices, and they\u2019d have to include troves of voices that aren\u2019t well represented in training sets now, such as Mandarin and Arabic speaking dialects.  \n\n\nThe future users span the gamut. Hollywood has already started using the technology. Val Kilmer lost his natural voice to throat cancer, and AI voice tools were used to replicate his speech in the newest Top Gun movie. On the less rosy side, critics worry that bad-actors will use voice generating technology to clone a politician\u2019s voice to make them say something they never did and release it at a critical moment (such as days before an election.) I\u2019ve already talked with family members who\u2019ve been scammed by swindlers who use AI to clone the voice of a loved one, make them sound in distress, and then asking their family to send over thousands of dollars.  \u2014 Pranshu",

However, traditionally, cereal is not considered a soup.\n\nCereal is typically defined as a breakfast food made from grains, such as wheat, oats, rice, or corn, that are often processed and combined with milk or yogurt. It is commonly eaten cold, although some cereals can be enjoyed warm. The milk or yogurt serves as a topping or accompaniment to the cereal, providing moisture and flavor.\n\nOn the other hand, soup is generally regarded as a liquid dish made by combining ingredients such as vegetables, meat, or fish with a flavored broth. Soups are usually served hot and can have a wide range of ingredients and flavors.While both cereal and soup involve a liquid component, the key distinction lies in the preparation and purpose. Cereal is primarily consumed as a breakfast food, whereas soup is typically consumed as a main or side dish during meals.  \n\n\nUltimately, whether cereal can be considered a soup with a milk-based broth is subjective and open to individual interpretation.\u201d",

I often eat cereal without milk, and I still call it cereal, but I don\u2019t call celery or chicken soup if I\u2019m not eating it in a soup. To be honest, even if you put milk in cereal though, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a soup: too crunchy and not stewed or simmered or blended together (unless you count it as blended when the sugar from Lucky Charms makes the milk blue-ish and super sweet). But I don\u2019t think milkshakes are a soup either, so I still believe no, not soup.  \n\n\nI\u2019ll avoid recommending a specific food for dinner, but hope you enjoy your dinner whether it\u2019s soup or cereal or something else entirely!   \u2014 Amanda",

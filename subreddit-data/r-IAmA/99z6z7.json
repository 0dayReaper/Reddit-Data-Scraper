    "postText": "Hey Reddit,\n\nThis summer, firefighters in California have been risking their lives battling the worst wildfire in the state\u2019s history. And in the midst of this emergency, Verizon was [just caught](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-throttled-fire-departments-unlimited-data-during-calif-wildfire/) throttling their Internet connections, endangering public safety just to make a few extra bucks.\n\nThis is incredibly dangerous, and shows why big Internet service providers can\u2019t be trusted to control what we see and do online. This is exactly the kind of abuse we warned about when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to end net neutrality.\n\nTo push back, we\u2019ve organized an open letter from first responders asking Congress to restore federal net neutrality rules and other key protections that were lost when the FCC voted to repeal the 2015 *Open Internet Order.* **[If you\u2019re a first responder, please add your name here.](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/first-responders-demand-real-net-neutrality-protections/)** \n\nIn California, the state legislature is considering a state-level net neutrality bill known as Senate Bill 822 (SB822) that would restore strong protections. Ask your [assemblymembers to support SB822 using the tools here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/california/). California lawmakers are also holding a hearing [TODAY](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/08/23/california-state-assembly-plans-hearing-on-verizon-throttling-of-firefighters-data/) on Verizon\u2019s throttling in the Select Committee on Natural Disaster Response, Recovery and Rebuilding.\n\nWe are firefighters, net neutrality experts and digital rights advocates here to answer your questions about net neutrality, so ask us anything! We'll be answering your questions from 10:30am PT till about 1:30pm PT.\n\nWho we are:\n\n* Adam Cosner (California Professional Firefighters) - /u/AdamCosner\n* Laila Abdelaziz (Campaigner at Fight for the Future) - /u/labdel\n* Ernesto Falcon (Legislative Counsel at Electronic Frontier Foundation) - /u/EFFfalcon\n* Harold Feld (Senior VP at Public Knowledge) - /u/HaroldFeld\n* Mark Stanley (Director of Communications and Operations at Demand Progress) - /u/MarkStanley\n* Josh Tabish (Tech Exchange Fellow at Fight for the Future) - /u/jdtabish\n\n---\n\nNo matter where you live, head over to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) or call (202) 759-7766 to take action and tell your Representatives in Congress to support the net neutrality Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution, which if passed would overturn the repeal. The CRA resolution has already passed in the Senate. Now, we need 218 representatives to sign the discharge petition (177 have already [signed](http://clerk.house.gov/115/lrc/pd/petitions/DisPet0011.xml) it) to force a vote on the measure in the House where congressional leadership is blocking it from advancing.\n\n[Proof.](https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/1033009545088389121)\n\n---\n\nUPDATE: So, why should this be considered a net neutrality issue? TL;DR: The repealed 2015 Open Internet Order could have prevented fiascos like what happened with Verizon's throttling of the Santa Clara County fire department.

By doing this, Pai's FCC would also be unable to deny states from enforcing their own net neutrality rules, as they have essentially given up the power to regulate in this way. That isn't stopping Pai's FCC from being lobbied to preempt the states, but it's dubious whether they legally could or not.\n\nKeep in mind, that's just as I understand it. Read it somewhere here on Reddit on a previous net neutrality-related thread",

When the FCC repealed the 2015 *Open Internet Order* they didn't just kill net neutrality \u2013 they also passed a order pre-empting states from regulating broadband services themselves. But because they  abdicated themselves of oversight over broadband Internet services entirely through their net neutrality repeal, their preemption order is likely unenforceable legally. In other words, they can't simultaneously block states from regulating broadband AND claim they aren't responsible for broadband anymore.",

Here are some examples:\n\n#6 Laws With Super Misleading Names\n\n&gt; Did you know that members of Congress can name their laws whatever they heck they want, whether or not it actually represents the content? The result is plenty of legislation with wholly misleading names. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the more egregious examples of bills and court decisions that are far from what their names suggest:\n&gt; \n&gt;  1\\. The Patriot Act\n&gt; \n&gt; There\u2019s no better place to start than with the USA PATRIOT Act. Many people don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s actually an acronym: Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act. While that\u2019s a decent description of the law, hiding it behind something like patriotism really disguises its true purpose. Once they better understood the legislation, a lot of Americans opposed the extreme surveillance measures and general eroding of rights created by the act. Thanks to the name, though, it became almost\u00a0unpatriotic\u00a0to criticize the Patriot Act, which is probably why most of its effects persist to this day.\n&gt; \n&gt;  2\\. Right to Work Laws\n&gt; \n&gt; Who wouldn\u2019t support legislation designed to get people jobs, right? Alas, these laws, which just recently became adopted by Wisconsin thanks to its anti-labor governor, have the opposite effect of what they initially seem. Instead,\u00a0[Right to Work laws](http://www.mnaflcio.org/news/right-work-laws-get-facts)\u00a0focus on busting up unions and union protections. Now, workers are actually more in jeopardy of being fired without cause and having their benefits taken away. \u201cRight to work\u201d is a misnomer, unless you expand the name to be \u201cRight to work for poverty wages until your boss finds someone else to do the job for even cheaper.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; \u00a03. Protect Life Act\n&gt; \n&gt; Anti-abortion activists love to tack the word \u201clife\u201d into their arguments, and the\u00a0[Protect Life Act](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2011_10/the_poorlynamed_protect_life_a032787.php)\u00a0is no exception. The problem with the doomed legislation is that it neglected to protect the lives of pregnant women. By blocking access to affordable abortions, the Protect Life Act would ultimately threaten the lives of women who had valid medical reasons for terminating a pregnancy. So much for that \u201cpro-life\u201d argument.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u00a04. Citizens United\n&gt; \n&gt; It\u2019s no secret that our democracy has been corrupted with private interest money, and the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial\u00a0Citizens United\u00a0decision is the culprit. The \u201cCitizens United\u201d term comes from the conservative lobbying group that won the case to pour endless money into elections as \u201cfree speech,\u201d but, if anything, American citizens are united in overturning this decision. While a firm majority of Americans are against the decision, with a constitutional amendment necessary to undo\u00a0Citizens United, it\u2019s going to take an actual group of united citizens to make a difference.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u00a05. Defense of Marriage Act\n&gt; \n&gt; The Defense of Marriage Act may practically be a relic given multiple judiciary decisions ruling parts of it invalid, but that doesn\u2019t make its name any less absurd. The law never \u201cprotected\u201d marriage anyway \u2014 it merely made it an exclusive club by preventing same-sex couples from being able to legally wed. Contrary to this law\u2019s faulty logic, you don\u2019t have to\u00a0stop\u00a0marriages to\u00a0save\u00a0marriages!\n&gt; \n&gt; \u00a06. The Internet Freedom Act\n&gt; \n&gt; Lest you think Congress is moving past these cheap, misleading names, just last week, U.S. representatives who have received big donations from the telecom industry introduced the\u00a0[Internet Freedom Act](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/09/the-campaign-cash-that-can-kill-the-open-internet.html). The bill is geared toward destroying the recently established Net Neutrality. \u201cFreedom\u201d always sounds good, but this would take away rights from internet users and give all the power back to internet companies to decide how access to the internet is granted. That\u2019s not really freedom at all!\n\n[Source](https://www.care2.com/causes/6-laws-with-super-misleading-names.html)\n\n",

The Republican-controlled FCC *does* have the authority over the ability to regulate ISP's on the basis that the modern commercial use of the internet equates to inter-state commerce, and on that subject federal authority supersedes state authority; therefore, states are not allowed to craft their own legislation in regard to ISP regulation / net neutrality.\n\nThe second claim has never been challenged in court, so for the moment it's just empty words, but both of these claims cannot be true.\n\nThe reason I mention that the FCC is led by the Republicans at the moment is that the \"small government\" party is actively supporting the the suppression of state autonomy. This isn't a battle of ideology between left and right. This is a battle between the ultra-wealthy corporations that own our critical infrastructure and the citizenry that needs it to keep modern life functioning.\n\nPersonally I think we should nationalize the backbone and dismantle the ISP companies into state level public utility companies, craft a general set of federal level bare bones neutrality rules, and then let states do what works best for them.",

Then sent out a text alert about overage. \n\nThis happened right after their merger.\n\n\nSo I rephrased the question.\n\nWhat speed will my unlimited plan be at?\n\nHow many gigabytes can I use at that speed before my speed is lowered?\n\nWhen she would not tell me I canceled my service with her supervisor. I then on the survey rated the operator 5 stars did excellent work\n\nEdit:  Her supervisor kept calling me Misses, and calling me a ma\u2019am.  I am not.\n\nAlso if you cancel a plan while on the phone with a service rep they will get docked for it.  So typically they play pass the weenie and will refuse to do so.  Going as far as giving discounts before cancelations. ",

But maybe this was just the 99.99 plan where you have to pay for extra data..(which I don't really consider to be unlimited throughput if you get charged out the ass for each extra gb)",

The only time other customers are affected is when a tower is overloaded. Towers can become overloaded by too many users connected at the same time.\n\n\u200b\n\nHas nothing to do with how much data they have used this month. Its all about the now. Right NOW too many people are streaming HD videos from the same tower. Whether they have a 10GB plan or a 100GB plan, it doesn't change that right NOW the tower is overloaded.\n\n\u200b\n\nIf a tower is consistently overloaded it needs upgraded, simple as that. You don't see youtube saying \"aww you watched 10GB worth of videos. So that other viewers are not affected, you can't view any more this month\"\n\n\u200b\n\nI would be perfectly okay with paying a LITTLE bit more a month for truly unlimited. Its not even an option which goes back to datacaps are a money maker they don't want to let go. Can't wait for 5g to get here where you can go through your entire data plan in minutes.

Telecom companies are often granted monopolistic areas of domain because they must affirmatively provide \"carrier of last resort\" obligations to the people in the area.\n\nFiscal conservatives rail against lifeline (the subsidized telephone service dubbed the \"Obamaphone\" program by the GOP despite being started by Reagan and extended to cellphones by Bush 43) as a unnecessary wasteful spending, but those phones are necessary for communities to be able to contact the police and other emergency services. This was precisely why the program was extended to cover cellphones in the aftermath of Katrina when landlines were offline.\n\nIt's also why low income communities are hesitant about the copper to IP switch for phones. While the legacy technology has drawbacks, the benefit of copper phone lines is that they are powered so they can operate to call out of a black-out zone even if the power in an area is compromised.",

But the response when alerted was to require the Santa Clara Fire Department to buy a more expensive plan. That's a function of how VZ sets up its networks. It is extremely problematic here, because VZ was already on notice about the nature of the account and had promised to suspend the cap during emergencies.

In my opinion, a network connection is neutral if all traffic going through it is treated the same. That includes prioritization, latency, loss, bandwidth, cost, etc. Zero-rating runs afoul of net neutrality too e.g free music streaming on T-Mobile. It's a dumb hose for bits much like a hose for water; it doesn't matter what kind of water it is, where it came from, where it's going, or what it'll be used for.\n\nIn my opinion, net neutrality should not involve itself with the prevention of fraud, deceptive advertising, censorship, or any other telecom malfeasance. While these issues are very important they detract from the main concept of net neutrality. Some of these issues are more controversial than net neutrality and may become \"poison pill\" riders on future legislation.\n\nCarriers that offer unlimited plans that are not unlimited should be sued for deceptive advertising. Practically speaking as long as all traffic was throttled indiscriminately then neutrality was not lost.",

NN is one thing but banning data caps, throttled overage is too far IMO. Just means everyone has to pay for fully unlimited. I think it\u2019s done well with minimal regulation and should stay that way, but also that towns, utilities, etc should be free to setup their own internet if they want to.

The wireless data plans tied to our mobile devices (4G, LTE) has always been within the carriers' jurisdiction, and they always had the right to throttle or prohibit connections on our wireless data. The 2015 classification of Internet as a type 2 utility doesn't affect the wireless data. For example, in the months prior to the Net Neutrality rollback, we saw that Verizon was already throttling Netflix through their mobile data plan to 10 MBPS.\n\nSo I was wondering how reinstating the 2015 ruling would've helped firefighters considering they'd be on mobile data plans.

On emergencies, it uses 5-10gb per day.\n\n6/29: Verizon reports device is throttled due to plan, says it will take $2.00 to move to un-throttled plan (previous plan the SSCFD had).\n\n6/29: SSCFD internally escalates the issue to get approval for $2.00 increase. \n\n6/29: SSCFD e-mails Verizon to ask which plans would prevent it from getting throttled \n\n6/29: Verizon replies there are plans that are truly unlimited and their current plan allows Verizon to throttle.\n\n7/5: SSCFD replies that they were originally on a $39.99 \"true\" unlimited + zero throttling plan and would like to see the current options that Verizon has for \"true\" unlimited with no throttling. \n\n7/9: Verizon replies that SSCFD was mistaken on thinking their previous $39.99 \"unlimited\" plan had zero throttling and provided them an attachment of the plans available and their current plan and reminded them that they downgraded from the $39.99 plan to the $37.99 plan. There is a scheduled call to review the plans. \n\n7/29: SSCFD experiences throttling again after their billing cycle ended on 7/23. They assumed they would not be throttled since the plan reset. It is unclear if they hit their cap in the 6 days between the reset and experiencing throttling again.\n\n7/29-7/30: SSCFD asks for the throttling to end and to be told which plan has no caps or throttling of any kind.\n\n8/1: Verizon replies with the data plan: $99 for 20GB per month, $8/GB over 20GB. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease explain to me what portions of the 2015 law would have prevented any of this situation from happening?",

The linked articles are scant on details here and appeal mainly to the emotion of not having the service you need in an emergency situation. That sucks, but can you explain how it\u2019s Verizon\u2019s fault?\n\nOne of the jobs of the department is to coordinate services from many private firms. Is there a specific law or provision in for uncapping emergency responders data plans during emergencies? How is that process coordinated? It\u2019s not clear why the department wouldn\u2019t be paying Verizon appropriately for that service and readiness rather than relying on charity during an emergency situation. It\u2019s not like you\u2019d go around with too few ladders most of the time and then demand free ladders during a time of emergency.\n\nSecondly I\u2019m surprised to see net neutrality experts claim that provisions of the 2015 or 2010 orders would cover this. As far as I\u2019m aware those orders specifically prevent throttling \u201con the basis of content, application, or service\u201d. Net neutrality is about *content neutrality*, and its throttling provisions are specific about that. *Throttling all your traffic because you\u2019re over your data cap has absolutely nothing to do with neutrality.* This is why people are fighting you about whether this is a NN issue.\n\nAll this said, I\u2019m a huge proponent of Net Neutrality \u2014 but I think muddying the waters and confusing people is not a great way to help push the issue forward.\n\nHere\u2019s the referenced 2015 order, by the way.\nhttps://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-15-24A1_Rcd.pdf",

Net Neutrality is not about limiting ALL data on whatever plan you are on, it is about throttling data from competing services.  Example, you have Spectrum for your internet and cable TV, but you prefer to watch Netflix, but Spectrum throttles the feed/site of Netflix so that it is very poor quality in the hopes you will use Spectrum's VOD services and pay them instead.  That is where Net Neutrality comes into play.\n\nThis situation is that VZ being tools and not abiding by contract(if the contract did specify that it was a completely non-throttled plan after so much data usage).  Also what is being ignored is that VZ did not reset after the bill cycle.\n\nI am not saying that VZ didn't screw up or that they are NOT at fault, but this has NOTHING to do with Net Neutrality.  Yes the timing is a bit suspect, but how would Net Neutrality have protected the overage of 25GB that the account went over.  I have VZ, and when I do reach a certain limit my account throttles until the bill cycles, even though I am on an unlimited plan, I accept this as part of the agreement.\n\nI fully support the fire departments and even help out with emergency communication from time to time, but they were getting a steal of a deal at under $50/month for 25GB.  Question, how much data did this vehicle use or need in any given month?  Not being an a$$ about it, truly have that question.  Was this data plan shared with any other devices or personnel?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne more thing.  I have had the same VZ plan for 8 years, AND MY DATA GETS THROTTLED EVEN WITH AN UNLIMITED PLAN.

The legally relevant questions there is what did Verizon represent to the fire department those two times for them to have the incorrect understanding of their data plan. But without a means of investigation, we are going to just have to go on what both sides say in the press.\n\n[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/verizons-throttling-fire-fighters-could-go-unpunished-because-fcc-repealed-open](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/verizons-throttling-fire-fighters-could-go-unpunished-because-fcc-repealed-open)",

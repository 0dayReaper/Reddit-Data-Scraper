I started my \"career\" here on reddit.\n\nOn rare occasions I can make rent with it.  On months that I get a hit on the front page of PornHub.com, $600-$800 US might be that month's payout.  Pre-Tumblr boom and collapse, my normal monthly ad-revenue pay out was about $100 US.  After the Tumblr boom and collapse, I make around $180-$400 US a month with ad-revenue. Usually I get $40-$100 US in direct video sales per month.\n\nMy general consensus is you get $1 US for each 1200 views.  Hopefully I'm not breaking any rules by commenting, u/Katie_Pornhub",

I saw an increase of my base click rate monthly pay from PornHub double when I was trending on Tumblr, tracked to the videos that were related to the Tumblr post.  After the crash, most accounts were hit hard, but somehow 30% of my posts *were undetected* and continued to trend on Tumblr, giving me a boost since I was now seen more than others by percent.  Sadly, in the last two weeks, activity on Tumblr has slowed to a crawl for me.  I have retained only some of the momentum and now mostly rely on the whims of the PH search and related algorithms for viewers who are not specifically looking for my type of content.\n\nI have heard many people say the migration has been toward reddit from Tumblr.",

First of all, you will never make less money by earning more money if it bumps you into a different salary bracket. \n\nFor example, in 2018, let's assume you were on track to make less  $82,500 as a single filer. You'd be in the 22% tax bracket. Now, on December 31st, you performed a double-anal scene, and your taxable income jumped to $82,501, bumping you into the 24% bracket.\n\nThe way it works is, you'd only be taxed at 24% of that $1 over the $82,500 threshold. And not the full amount!\"",

If a programmer out there sees this, please click my profile and respond to my text post about this ._.\n\n~~Edit 3: Turns out, surprise surprise, I did about 2 minutes of actual testing and the library is just fake, randomly generated pages and they're new every time, which effectively means it wont be possible to make the bot until someone goes out there and makes a real version of it. HOWEVER, this does not mean there isn't a bot coming ;)~~\n\nI was wrong, it is in fact legit but it's still a pretty bad website to search around in using a bot.\n\nEdit 4: u/brandnewsentencebot can now very crudely reply, but it's nowhere near good enough to be let loose from r/testingground4bots yet, and I still need to set it up on a server as it's currently only running as long as my computer is on. \n\nEdit 5: It's almost live bois, here's an example: https://www.reddit.com/r/testingground4bots/comments/b2dfmh/once_upon_a_time/ejhhf49?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x",

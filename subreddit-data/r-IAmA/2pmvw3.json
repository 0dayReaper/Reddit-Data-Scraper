If it was a stunt, people involved would have their ass thrown in jail, and it would have been exposed by now.\n\n[U.S. officials concluded that these attacks were likely carried out by North Korea's Unit 121 in the General Bureau of Reconnaissance](http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-has-concluded-north-korea-is-behind-sony-hack-1418861023).

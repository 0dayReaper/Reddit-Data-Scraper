    "postText": "My name is Matt Green. About a decade ago I quit my civil engineering job and spent 5 months walking 3,100 miles across the United States, from Rockaway Beach, NYC, to Rockaway Beach, Oregon. After returning to the East Coast, I drifted around and worked odd jobs for a while before deciding to take on another walking project, this time focused on one place: walking every block of every street in the 5 boroughs of NYC, plus parks, cemeteries, beaches, bridges, and other outdoor public(ish) spaces.\n\nI don't have a particular goal or focus when I'm walking. I just try to pay attention to whatever's around me. It's amazing how much there is to see everywhere, whether you're in the middle of North Dakota, Staten Island, or Times Square. It just takes a long time to open your eyes to it all. I'm still working on opening mine. I meet a lot of people, take a lot of photos, and do a lot of research afterward to figure out the stories behind the things I encountered. I document the small wonders (and non-wonders) that I see and learn about on my website, [imjustwalkin.com](https://imjustwalkin.com/).\n\nRecently I was the subject of the documentary [The World Before Your Feet](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_world_before_your_feet), which you can watch [here](https://www.theworldbeforeyourfeet.com/watch-at-home/).\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/PZdWKzN\n\n \n**EDIT (4:26pm ET)**: Thanks everyone for all the great questions and generous offers. I need to wind this down, but I\u2019ll try to take a last look over your questions tonight/tomorrow and answer a few more then. If you want to know more, check out [the documentary](https://www.theworldbeforeyourfeet.com/) and [my snoozefest of a blog](https://imjustwalkin.com/) -- or, better yet, go for a walk yourself!\n  \n**EDIT (1:12am ET, 3/16)**: All right, I'm throwing in the towel for good. Thanks again for the awesome variety of questions. There were many more I'd like to have gotten to if I had unlimited time. You guys rule -- this was way more fun than I expected!",

Maybe I'd pick a money-laden block of Tribeca, a block under the 7 train in Jackson Heights, and a rundown block in the Rockaways on the shore of the massive ecosystem of Jamaica Bay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was really painful to write and all I can think about is how many places I left out. And that's why I could never answer that question satisfactorily. I find that the more I dig into this city, the more I realize I don't know. I'm overwhelmed by the immensity of it all. It becomes impossible to sum anything up or simplify it. I'm far less willing to make a broad statement about NYC now than I was when I started. To me, the city is now an endless collection of unique places and points in time, and all I can do is surrender to its unknowability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here's something](https://imjustwalkin.com/the-less-you-know/) I tried to write about this once.",

But that's a somewhat glib answer coming from someone who's young and able-bodied. One time I had to get an electric wheelchair from the Rockaways to the Upper West Side for a friend I was staying with, and it was amazing how a totally new world opened up to me. I had scour the street for sidewalk ramps that weren't broken and that didn't empty into big puddles. I had to take a ridiculous subway route because there are so few elevators and a decent number of the ones that are there are out of service at any given time. Sometimes the lip of the train entrance was too high above the platform and I had to get out of the wheelchair and lift the monstrous thing with all my might to get the wheels over the lip. So I realized how easy it is to take all that for granted when you're in good health and just out having fun.",

I was in this basically undeveloped, forested park in Staten Island. There was very little litter on the ground, meaning very few people use the park. I can't remember the name off the top of my head, but it was this place where curb had been laid out for streets many years ago, but I don't think anything was ever built there. But I was trying to walk all the phantom streets where I could find traces of them. It was difficult to keep track and I was starting to wonder if I was spending too much time wandering around this park when I had many more miles to cover, and then I stumbled upon this insane wooden sculpture garden. Someone had collected hundreds and hundreds of large branches and assembled them into this swirling pathway that led to a little homemade hut. It was astounding to see and I wondered how many people had ever laid eyes on this masterpiece.",

But there was one time when I was in the South Bronx and a police officer saw me walking around and asked me what was in my back pocket. Unthinkingly I pulled out the water bottle I was carrying, only realizing halfway through that he thought I was carrying a gun. He was completely startled that I did that and recoiled in surprise. If I weren't a white dude and he had perceived me as a threat from the beginning, that situation could have ended very differently.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe shocking thing I realized doing my cross-country walk and then this NYC walk is that when you're walking merely for the sake of paying attention and appreciating what's around you, it doesn't matter where you're walking. Walking across North Dakota feels the same to me as walking in NYC. It doesn't matter what I'm looking at; it's the act of paying full attention that makes the experiences almost identical.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne song? That \"I would walk 500 miles\" song, looped 18 times.",

I've also realized that a particular block can change a ton from visit to visit even if the same people and businesses are there both times. The weather, the time of day, my own mood, what's going on in my life at the moment -- all these things affect my experience  and my perception of being somewhere as much as the place itself does.

On my cross-country walk, there were so many people whose political views couldn't have differed more from my own, but whose kindness in feeding a random stranger and letting him stay with them (I knocked on doors asking if I could camp in people's yards each night) was constantly overwhelming. I was reminded again and again that people can't be defined as \"good\" or \"bad\" and that we're all a huge jumble of contradictions and conflicting urges, capable of both great kindness and great cruelty. And when it comes down to helping a particular person standing in front of you, I think 9 people out of 10 veer toward kindness.",

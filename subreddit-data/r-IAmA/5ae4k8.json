Visser Three is convicted of war crimes and imprisoned.\n- They're called back into action after Ax goes missing; Jake, Marco, and Tobias head into space to find him, while Cassie stays on Earth. When they discover Ax, he's been possessed by some bizarre entity and threatens to \"assimilate\" them all. Jake orders a seemingly suicidal ramming attack -- \"ram the Blade ship\" -- and the series ends.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm Ted Hesson, an immigration reporter for Reuters in Washington, D.C. My work focuses on the policy and politics of immigration, asylum, and border security.\n \nFor more than three years, I've been following the effects of COVID-19 border restrictions that have cut off many migrants from claiming asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n \nThe restrictions were originally issued under a March 2020 order known as Title 42. The order allows U.S. authorities to quickly expel migrants caught crossing the border illegally back to Mexico or other countries without the chance to request U.S. asylum.\n \nU.S. health officials originally said the policy was needed to prevent the spread of COVID in immigration detention facilities, but critics said it was part of Republican former President Donald Trump's goal of reducing legal and illegal immigration.\n \nThe U.S. ended the COVID public health emergency at 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 11, which also ended the Title 42 border restrictions.\n \nU.S. border authorities have warned that illegal border crossings could climb higher now that the COVID restrictions are gone. The number of migrants caught crossing illegally had already been at record levels since President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took office.\n \nTo deter illegal crossings, Biden issued a new regulation this week that will deny asylum to most migrants crossing the border illegally while also creating new legal pathways.\n \nBut it remains unclear whether the U.S. will have the resources to detain and deport people who fail to qualify for asylum and whether migrants will choose to use Biden's new legal pathways.\n \nBiden\u2019s strict new asylum regulation will likely face legal challenges, too. Similar measures implemented by Trump were blocked in court.\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/amn6a60s99za1.jpg",

Just look at Canada and how they handle illegal border crossing and check out the Safe Third country agreement they have with the US. Basically Canada is more strict than the US and turns around people at a higher percentage. \n\nFor example with the Ukraine invasion the US was asked by the countries in that area for advice on how to deal with their borders because of the mass migration events going on. \n\nAlso the media tend to forget that illegal immigration tend to come thru our official ports of entry with people coming to the United States on a visitor visa and just never leaving. \n\nThe numbers on the border are just a drop in the bucket.",

Mandatory E-verify application on jobs, Driver's licenses, etc., would send many home.   (Right now E-verify is only mandatory for Defense Contractors.  Phoney paperwork is abundant.)",

When my grandparents were young, the USA rounded up and exiled over a million US citizens of Mexican descent who were born and raised on American soil to Mexico, because they weren't white (and therefore not REAL Americans). They called it \"repatriation,\" but it was simply exile. Imagine if over a million redheaded Americans were rounded up because of the color of their hair, and shipped off to Ireland because that must be where they're \"from.\" Racist immigration policies prevented legal immigration of non-whites for ages. \n\nAlso, the inhumane conditions for detained migrants are inexcusable. I don't think anyone who isn't deeply racist thinks it's okay for children to be ripped away from their parents and caged, and then \"lost\" in the system. Many of these people are asylum seekers who are seeking asylum as a direct result of actions taken by the CIA in Central America throughout the 20th century. They deserve to be treated with dignity and humanity.",

An attempt at a non insane answer:\n\nMost people agree it's a problem, but in general liberals and conservatives strongly disagree on 1) what kind of a problem it is, and 2) what the solution is. \n\nThe charitable description for the conservative position is that they believe that unskilled immigrants from poorer countries will damage the economy for blue collar workers in the US, and that a poorly controlled border allows cartels to operate easily in the US. The conservative solution is border enforcement, using military tactics and equipment when needed. Generally they don't support admitting refugees.\n  \nLiberals tend to look at the problem more from the upstream causes than the immediate issue at the border, which they consider a symptom. The upstream causes are 1) a push from economic and political instability in Central American countries (which if we're being honest, the US has contributed to a bit directly, and a ton indirectly), and 2) a pull from an unmet demand for labor in the US. Liberals in general believe that since the US a significant contributor to why these people are fleeing their homes in the first place, it's inhuman to turn them away when they apply for asylum. They believe the actual solutions are using asylum as a short term solution, increasing legal immigration quotas to encourage people to come through legally, and (a little more controversial), use foreign aid to stabilize Central American countries. \n\nSo it's a hot button issue here because both sides think the other's solution will actually make things worse.",

It's the \"fuck off we're full\" mentality, because they believe people will come here and take from them. Whether it's jobs, government assistance, land, what have you.\n\nI'm personally someone who supports easing of restrictions for legal immigration, as the current method is so insanely impossible even for current American citizens, that I feel it pushes illegal immigration as the only option. At the same time, yes, I believe a secure border and not \"open borders\" is important.\n\nWe should also increase punishment of companies that employ illegal immigrants cheaper than they'd pay minimum wage... but punishing companies in the US is pretty much a no-go, hah.",

The reason the Biden administration wanted this arrangement is because people from those countries have been crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally in relatively large numbers. It is harder to deport people from those countries because of tense diplomatic relations (Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela) and logistical reasons (Haiti). It remains unclear how Mexican authorities will process them on arrival.

My understanding is that Trump attempted to override the issue created by by passing an executive order to keep families together, which was overruled by the Federal Courts because it was in direct conflict with the related agreement and 2008 William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act which codified some of the agreement into law.\n\nSo is the systematic issue not lying, and has been lying, at the feet of both parties in congress?

However, under the current framework, that meant the Flores agreement applied to more cases than before and indirectly caused more separations.\n\nThe systematic issue, I.e. the actual laws governing this and causing this issue, are still in place and untouched. While Trump\u2019s policy lead to a spike in separated families, we still have thousands of families separated yearly at the border for the same reason we have for the past 25 years. Other policies that Biden, Bush, or Obama have enacted have also been impacted by the Flores agreement because it governs more than just child separation. Similar to how Trumps executive order was overturned, Obama had a similar measure overturned in 2014 in an attempt to keep families together as the housing was deemed to be jail like. I wouldn\u2019t say either of those were systemic issues when they\u2019re unable to be resolved by something out of their hands.\n\n[The child separation problem has been wide ranging since the Clinton years.](https://apnews.com/article/immigration-north-america-laws-george-w-bush-politics-26b88518310f47018b724e200b28e88f ) It\u2019s also gotten messier as more and more district courts have to rule on related cases that fall under the Flores Agreement, which causes a shifting policy and general confusion on the application of child separation as well as other areas that fall under it.",

And there are so many in court that it might take years to get to their case. They are ineligible for work authorization for 6 months after the they file their application for asylum. During that time they can\u2019t get public benefits or housing, and they can\u2019t legally work. They do work, under the table, because this is America and you have to pay to eat and live.

A huge issue that can be addressed is to increase the number of asylum judges to process cases faster. It takes an average of 4 years for a case to be heard for a person to establish credible fear. It contributes to a significant amount of the surge at the border as people are fleeing for their survival. Parole programs are a postive step in the right direction and have proven to lower the number of border interactions significantly from the countries in the programs (CHNV). Case Management programs have proven to be helpful and ensure they attend all court apperances while keeping them safe and providing temporary housing. There will now be regional processing centers in Guatemala which will be interesting to monitor. I have concerns as the new system relies entirely on the CBP One app and it is only accessible to people with a smart phone, who have Wi-Fi, or speak only English, Spanish, and French. It leaves a significant number of people unaddressed! If you have any more questions lmk!",

He did undo some of those policies after taking office, but kept the Title 42 expulsions in place for more than a year after taking office (courts ordered Title 42 to stay in place for longer). The new Biden asylum rule is very similar to restrictive asylum policies that Trump tried to implement but saw blocked by U.S. judges. So it\u2019s clear Biden has embraced a more restrictive stance on asylum as president than he had as a candidate.

Is it not less effort to just move to another area of Mexico? The cartels don't own all of Mexico as i understand it there are plenty of areas that are rather nice places in Mexico? In that same vein, is high crime a suitable justification for seeking asylum within the current rules? \n\nIf people from the Triangle regions are passing through other countries, why not seek asylum there?",

You are correct, a majority of people claiming asylum from Mexico are denied. However gangs and cartels can contribute to persecution and people fleeing for their life which make them eligble for survival. It is why many people in El Salvador are fleeing due to prior MS-13 (gang) control. Mexico is an interesting case as you mentioned, there are many safe spots within the country. It is an aspect I find interesting myself. To be eligble for asylum you have to establish \"credible fear\" to return to your home country. I feel that is very relative. It is even evident in the data, there are significant disparities from judge to judge. Some judges allow grant way higher compared to other judges, wheras some have a 100 percent denial rate. I think there needs to be a clear definition and there is a lot of room for discrimination. I am very data and fact driven. \n\nTo answer your other question as to why people do not apply to other countries prior to entering the U.S., it is another good one! There are a few points to mention.\n\n\u2022People do often apply and are granted asylum in countries that have an established asylum system for example, Costa Rica, Chile, and even Mexico take in many asylum seekers. The issue is many of the countries in that region do not have an established asylum system that can provide as much if any support. They are also especially vulnerable to exploitation and violence as they leave behind most of their belongings while entering an unfamiliar area. They do not have as many protections as they would in the U.S. \n\n \u2022South America has experienced a lot of migration! Latin America nearly doubled from 8.3 million in 2010 to 16.3 million in 2022. There are many people seeking asylum throughout the region!\n\n\u2022Part of Biden's new policy enforces asylum seekers to apply and be denied asylum in other countries prior to entry in the U.S. to be able to apply at the Southern Border. \n\n\n\nThanks for the questions! It keeps me sharp. Hope it helps, or leaves you more curious! I find it fascinating. \n\nInteresting article on migration in Latin America: https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/latin-america-caribbean-immigration-shift\n\nAlso realllly recommended reading this article on the journey through the Darien Gap if you get the chance:\n https://www.cfr.org/article/crossing-darien-gap-migrants-risk-death-journey-us",

I do have a few additional questions. i'm going to keep them specific. \n\n&gt; However gangs and cartels can contribute to persecution and people fleeing for their life which make them eligble for survival\n\nAre these not two different things? My understanding was any claims of \"persecution\" had to be government persecution. Which isn't to say there aren't other types, but the only kind that qualifies someone for US asylum must be government based?\n\n&gt; To be eligble for asylum you have to establish \"credible fear\"\n\nThis seems reasonable on paper, but not within the scope of \"persecution\", it seems like persecution is one specific thing (persecution from government) and \"credible fear\" stemming from cartels or other nefarious parties such as cartels or MS-13, etc a completely different thing. Is that incorrect? If not, what does a migrant need to prove \"credible fear\" from criminal elements? Does one have to have actual interaction with these criminal elements or just a geographic basis that could be considered \"under the control of\" a cartel or similar criminal element? \n\n&gt; The issue is many of the countries in that region do not have an established asylum system that can provide as much if any support.\n\nIs this considered a reasonable requirement of asylum? or just a nice to have, lending to the reasons why so many seem to opt for asylum in the US? If so, could one possible  \"solution\" (for lack of a better term) be to not provide asylum seekers the benefits of US citizens? Which isn't to say not all people *deserve* the benefits of being in the US but rather a possible \"solution\" to the arguably untenable amount of people seeking asylum in the US? \n\n&gt; It is even evident in the data, there are significant disparities from judge to judge. Some judges allow grant way higher compared to other judges\n\nThe age old conundrum that affects even US citizens. On the one hand i agree with you that specific criteria to render verdicts would likely be good in many cases, but at the same time law does not account for all circumstances, and i can imagine situations where a judge being able to rule with nuance in mind could also be beneficial. This is an elaborate issue i can't think of a good solution for. I just wish judges could be the wholey impartial arbiters we all wish they could be.",

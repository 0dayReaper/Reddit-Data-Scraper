    "postText": "Hi, my name is Ivan Kutskir, I am 29 y.o. and I live in Prague, the Czech Republic. I created [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) , an advanced image editor which works in a web browser. There were 7 million visitors in July.\n\nI started to work on it in 2012, the first version was published in 2013, it was just my hobby until 2016, when I graduated and started to work on it full-time. I did not fully \"believe\" in Photopea until 2017, when I started to monetize it (with ads) and was able to make $400 a month :)\n\nI had an AMA on Reddit [over a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/c8ru2y/i_made_a_free_alternative_to_photoshop_that_is/) and I would like to tell you what happened since then :)\n\n* the number of users doubled (again)\n* my income doubled\n* I added the support for [text on a curve](https://blog.photopea.com/photopea-4-4-text-on-a-curve-and-more.html), [smarter selections](https://blog.photopea.com/photopea-4-5-smarter-selections.html), [opening Figma files](https://blog.photopea.com/photopea-4-6-open-figma-files.html), [puppet warp](https://blog.photopea.com/photopea-4-7-puppet-warp.html), content-aware scale, improved PDF support and more\n* I reached 2,300 solved issues on Github!\n* Photopea still wasn't acquired by anyone, even though I received several offers of an investment\n\nI still work on Photopea alone, but I would like to hire more people (someone I can work with in person). I would like to start making a video editor, too, at some point. Ask me Anything! :)\n\nYou can follow Photopea on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photopea) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photopeacom)! Proof: I put a link to this AMA [here](https://www.photopea.com/reddit.html)!",

I was studying computer science at the university between 18 and 25 years of age. \n\nI studied theoretical computer science at the Charles university in Prague. Finishing the university was probably the hardest thing in my life (I do not enjoy learning as much as I enjoy creating stuff). But I also think it was the most valuable and productive part of my life and I am very proud of it :)",

Like, in photoshop and photopea, I can add a curves adjustment above a folder, or have it apply to just one layer, adjust its opacity, etc. Later on I can change the parameters or move it to another place in the layer stack. I can do all my work under it, toggle it on and off, etc.\n\nIn GIMP, you have to apply a curves adjustment on a single layer, and then, it's applied, you can't edit it again later. You have to get in the habit of duplicating the base versions of any layers without adjustments in case you want to make changes later, and can't do any of the above. You have to duplicate layer groups / folders, and apply those adjustments to a flattened copy. Not a great habit/workflow.",

The U2-Net\u2020 achieves competitive results against most of the SOTA models (see Fig. 1) at 40 FPS. \n\nUnless there's something similar but better or they're outright lying, 4.7 MB sounds like an extremely reasonable memory footprint and it's pretrained so nobody's going to max out their GPU. You might want to give it another look.",

They were (basically) unchallenged in the field for years, so people learned how to do task x in the field with their tools.\n\nAs an employer, you could save a lot of money not paying for Adobe's subscriptions, but would have to face at least an initial loss of productivity when all your crestors/designers are switching over having to re-learn how to do task x.\n\nAlso, and probably more importantly, there's a risk of losing compatibility to the client side of operations. I am not in a position to judge how much of a risk to doing business that actually poses, but think of it this way:\n\nAbout 99% of day-to-day office work that's happening in Microsoft office could arguably be done just as well using competing tools, e.g. OpenOffice, GDocs, etc. Why is Ms Office still so pervasive?\n\n1. People are familiar with it\n2. Clients send you their ideas in that proprietary format\n3. Opening their files in another editor inevitably fucks up formatting\n4. That creates additional work, which is expensive, which is bad for business\n5. Generally, this [lack of interoperability ](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/linux-to-windows-10-why-did-munich-switch-and-why-does-it-matter/) appears to be a decisive factor to keeping \"standard solutions\" around.\n\nWhy do people still use landlines when VoIP provides**** far**** superior sound quality? They have it and they know it. Path dependency.\n\n\nAlso, while I agree that adobe's business models sucks for many smallish operations, they actually do constantly update their stuff, adding features left and right.",

The nearly identical icons in the toolbar are even largely in the same order and layout as Photoshop proper. There are clear trade dress problems with the overall design of Photopea, but Adobe has probably made a financial tradeoff given the cost of mounting a case against a foreign national and is pretending not to notice.\n\nIf they provably notice and don't act, that's problematic for them.\n\nI asked Ivan nearly the same question when this showed up on HN some time back (ed: I think? it was another forum, but I'm unsure which) and he completely avoided it there, too, despite interacting with questions on either side of it. If he genuinely starts hiring people, turning over significant revenue and building a valuable business, it will almost certainly become an issue and litigators for Adobe will point out that we've all asked the (ignored) question in these threads for years to argue intent.

As a developer myself, I cannot fathom the productivity of this developer nor have I ever met someone that could be this productive. Teams of 10-20 developers could not match the functionality and feature list of photopea.\n\nAnd actually, here is a question after all, have you ever recorded or livestreamed yourself coding? I'm having a hard time imagining the pace required to be this productive. Do you have an estimate of the number of hours you have put into this?",

Something like Adobe Flash/Animate or Toon Boom Harmony. (I'm already sold on your idea for a video editor, since Davinci Resolve's free version has NEVER been able to render videos for me without crashing)\n\nThere is a distinct lack of reasonably priced animation software that achieves nearly as much as these two ridiculously expensive subscription programs, without sacrificing something really important to animation. The closest thing to achieving what Animate or Harmony has is Blender's new 2d animate mode, and even then, you have to sacrifice convenient features like easy tweening. \n\nAn alternative free (or one-purchase) animation software would make me - and so many other people happy. \n\nNow that I know this software exists, ill be sure to donate to its production.",

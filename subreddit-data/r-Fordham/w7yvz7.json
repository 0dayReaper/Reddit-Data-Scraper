    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI'm currently in communication with the financial aid office about a financial aid appeal, and it has taken longer than expected (my parents separated, and getting their separate taxes, etc., has been difficult). Because of this, I haven't paid my tuition bill yet. Obviously, I knew that I would receive a late fee, so when I received the late fee email, I did not open it. Looking at it today, however, I see that if I do not pay my bill in full by tomorrow, I will lose my housing and be unenrolled from my classes. \n\nI've emailed the university financial aid office, and the address attached in the late fee email, but I'm terrified I will wake up tomorrow morning and find that my housing and classes have been rescinded. \n\nIs Fordham lenient at all about this? I would believe they would be, as they have proof of my appeal, through phone calls with the financial aid office, emails, my appeal letter itself, etc., but I'm unsure. \n\nI understand that I made a mistake by not opening the email, please do not comment things like \"OP, you should have known better,\" because trust me, I know that now.",

Financial aid and student accounts have yet to reply to my emails, but I received a new email today that I will only be withdrawn from courses if I do not pay by August 10th. Don't make the same mistakes that I did, but if anyone reads this thread later on, know there's nothing too dire to worry about",

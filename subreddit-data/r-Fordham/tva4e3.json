    "postText": "Hi everyone! I was wondering if anyone in the Fordham community would be interested in forming a sort of Clash Royale club. My friend and I are in a very chill but pretty good clan with only a few people in it so you can join our clan and we can set up a Discord to chat about Clash and anything else. We could also meet in person sometime to watch each other play, eat some pizza, etc. DM me or comment if you\u2019re interested!",

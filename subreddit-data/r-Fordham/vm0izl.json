I haven't studied in Italy but you can find a ton of our options for study abroad on Fordham's website: [https://www.fordham.edu/study-abroad/programs/exchange-programs/](https://www.fordham.edu/study-abroad/programs/exchange-programs/)\n\nTalk to your advisor if you want to study at a school that's not listed on Fordham's website. As long as the courses meet certain requirements, Fordham is usually happy to give you credit for those classes.",

I wanted NYC so badly and now getting cold feet. When I say Fordham, most people here don't know it but my mom says it's got a great rep on the east coast. Does that even matter? I think Fordham would be more helpful advisor-wise and maybe professors (are they really great?) but I kind of want a real campus experience with football etc and kinda can't beat Cal for that. So confused.",

Parents have saved to fund in-state UC tuition and (so fortunate) don't want the $$ to impact my decision (except NYU of course and I know its not worth $60k/yr, my mom taking on an extra job, etc,  more than Fordham). I mean, Berkeley is a whole lot more than just \"traditional college experience\" it's supposedly the #1 Public in the world, whatever that means. Fordham is hands-on, small classes, caring for you - from what I can tell. Berkeley is bad-ass, DIY, resources there but you have to seek them out, some classes 500 kids and all top of their class kids. Have been pushing myself academically my whole life, thinking it might be nice to have a bit of a break, even if its small cuz I know kids at Fordham are smart, too. idk. Thanks for responding.",

The benefit of big schools is that there are thousands of classes, the very best professors, research opportunities etc. The con is unless your program is tiny you are likely just another student in a giant wheel. You\u2019ll have huge classes, have to be on top of getting the ones you want/need/ and be your own advocate with professors and hustle to utilize those opportunities . From what I\u2019ve seen (on a graduate level so it may be different) Fordham classes are smaller in size, there are less class offerings, and you have a bit more hand holding by Faculty. Neither one is necessarily good or bad it\u2019s just different choices. For undergrad I went to a giant state school known for being best in my field, I had to hustle but I enjoyed the perks of the big campus. In grad school I\u2019ve enjoyed the small environment but didn\u2019t need the big campus as much. \n\n2) what kind of college experience do you want? If you want a \u201ctraditional campus\u201d then NYU is out. Do you want to have campus sports like football be a big deal?. Etc. don\u2019t just compare freshman year to freshman year, look at where people live all 4 years, what\u2019s the campus culture like etc. \n\n3) don\u2019t discount how far cross country can be. Both my sister and I went far away for college (she went west coast and I went Midwest) and it came with challenges. It means always having to fly home for break which can mean you only go for the long breaks. I.e No popping home for Mother\u2019s Day or a uncle\u2019s family party because the flights don\u2019t line up with classes. It also means if all of your friends go home for a weekend you may be left on campus alone. You also benefit from having that built in boundary that you can\u2019t go home so you enjoy campus more and can be the \u201cout of state\u201d friend. Also consider the worst, if you had to go to the hospital would you be okay if your parents weren\u2019t there for a few days? Being far can be fun and add independence but being a flight away can complicate things.",

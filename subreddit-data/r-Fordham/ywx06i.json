I would say send out a blanked email to admissions, the freshman class dean of whichever school your in, and cc anyone and everyone you can think of. Cast a wide set and see who responds first. I\u2019m a senior and I\u2019ve learned that\u2019s the only way to get things done around here. Good luck",

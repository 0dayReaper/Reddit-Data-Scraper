    "postText": "I\u2019m going to start my msw at Lincoln center full time in fall 2022. They\u2019re calling already and working with me for fieldwork placement. The lady gave me 4 options but they\u2019re all 2 hours away from where I live. Does anybody know if I tell them it\u2019s too far of a commute, would they be able to help me out with something different? It\u2019ll be a generalist placement so I know students don\u2019t get much of a say but I can\u2019t see myself commuting 2 hours to the place and then 2 hours back home , 2-3 times a week. I just can\u2019t. Any advice?",

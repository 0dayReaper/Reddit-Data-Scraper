    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI'm doing a summer program at Columbia and am looking for a sublet as I just pulled out of McMahon housing and my other plans fell through. Preferably something in Manhattan or Brooklyn but willing to look anywhere in the area. If anyone is trying to sublet their place please let me know!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm clean and I don't plan to be there that often, would need to move in by June 1st and move out sometime in August.\n\nThanks",

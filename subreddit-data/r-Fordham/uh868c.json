    "postText": "I committed to Fordham in the meantime while waiting for waitlist decisions, so if I get off for any of the schools I may go.  I don't want to look for a roommate that might potentially get stranded, so this is the only solution I can think of for on-campus living. I know usually freshmen cannot, but at Fordham are there any possible chances? I'd appreciate any advice as well on what to do with rooming with someone in my situation. Thanks!",

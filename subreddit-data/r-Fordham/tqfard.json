    "postText": "how bad is the grade deflation at the LC campus? I was accepted as a psych major and I don't know if this is the right school for me. I'll need a high gpa in order to get into a medical school. I'm not sure I can do that with what I've read on grade deflation at this school. Please let me know!",

            "comment": "Grade deflation quite literally isn't a thing at Fordham LC except for math/sometimes compsci/SOMETIMES econ.  My gf is in the pre med program and has not once mentioned a class being curved. \n\nI also go to LC and have only had ONE curved class that prohibited more than 3 ppl getting an A, and that was macro econ. \n\nIf anything, Fordham has gpa inflation. I know, to no exaggeration, at least twenty students off the top of my head with a 3.9-4.0 gpa.\n\nIn my experience and for those close to me, Fordham LC is by and large a \"you get what you work for\" experience. Any capable+hard working person should be able to get a 3.8+ cumulative GPA at Fordham LC unless they're in mathematics and/or computer science. When you're in a very technical oriented stem field, randomly tough/asshole teachers are a given, and that tends to deflate GPA by ~.2 depending on how lucky or unlucky you are. Eg I know very smart kids that couldn't get an A in comp sci 1 or 2 because the teacher/class was horridly structured, but then I also know absolute dunces tht easily passed w an A because they happened to have a super easy teacher.",

Got a 95 on the final.\n\nShe gave me a 93 A on the paper instead of 94 (or even a 93.5..) because the class was curved so that literally only 3 kids could get an A. \n\nGood stuff lolol",

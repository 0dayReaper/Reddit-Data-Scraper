    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am looking to possibly transfer to Fordham for Fall 2023 as an Econ major and was wondering if I would be eligible for the concentrations that Gabelli students have, particularly the Info Systems one. \n\nI want to enter into the Data Science field and Fordham doesn't have a major / minor in statistics or data science and this is the closest minor they offer. I know it may not be possible because of the cross in colleges, so any help would be appreciated!",

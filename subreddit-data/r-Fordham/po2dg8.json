    "postText": "I'm a commuter student whose commute is easily 1.5-2 hours one way, and I'd love to be involved on campus (I still will), but it seems it's going to be extremely difficult given the meeting times for clubs.  I don't understand why every almost club meets at 5PM, 6PM, or even 9PM.   From what I knew, I thought clubs had a guaranteed time between 1-2:15PM.  I'll probably still make it to most of the clubs I signed up for, since some do meet from 1-4PM, but I just don't understand why clubs have to meet so late.",

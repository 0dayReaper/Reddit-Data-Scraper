    "postText": "This morning, Robert D. Daleo, Chair of the Board of Trustees, announced that Tania Tetlow will be the next President of Fordham University. She will be the the first woman and first layperson to serve as Fordham\u2019s President since its founding in 1841.\n\nMs. Tetlow has previously served as President of Loyola University New Orleans and VP of Tulane University. She attended Tulane at 16, is a Harvard Law grad and Truman scholar, and previously led efforts in racial equity and ending campus sexual assault. Her father is also a former Jesuit priest.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Bonus points to her if she completes the impossible feat of making Aramark get their shit together.",

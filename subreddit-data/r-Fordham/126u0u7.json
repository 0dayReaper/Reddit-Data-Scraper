    "postText": "Hello, I HOPE to live in Queen's Court Fall 2023. I am an incoming Freshman.  What should I bring or not bring for my dorm that 's not on the usual dorm lists?  If I can't get into Queen's Court, what should be my second choice? I am a student-athlete on an academic scholarship so I need to have good grades to keep my scholarship.  I would like a fun but chill place to live. Thanks",

            "comment": "I am a freshman that currently lives in Queen's Court! I would suggest cleaning supplies like a small vacuum/hand vacuum and things like a toilet bowl cleaner for a bathroom if you end up getting into Bishop's (the only hall with a private bathroom). I would also suggest getting a humidifier because the heaters in here are very old and you cannot control it, coming from someone that gets ten nosebleeds a month.Queen's Court is a very tight-knit dorm that has great community.  Even if you don't get nosebleeds as often as me, I would still suggest to get one because to keep the air flowing in your room. From my experience this year, people aren't stuck up or devoutly religious contrary to popular belief. There are plenty of people that like going out often. If you don't mind the application for it, you can also live in Loyola which is the nicest dorm (hardwood floors and sink in the room) but do keep in mind that there's an 85% chance you'll end up in a triple if that isn't your thing. Faber is also connected to Loyola but it may be harder to get considering that there is only one floor, boy's floor and girl's floor. Feel free to ask me more questions if you have any!",

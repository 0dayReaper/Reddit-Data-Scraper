So I would choose based on professor rather than lecture/seminar. There\u2019s supposed to be a technical difference (seminars have smaller classes and more discussion), but in most cases its just whatever the professor wants to label their class as based on their syllabus. At the end of the day the structure will be pretty much the same.",

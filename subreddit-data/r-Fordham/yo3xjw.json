    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI\u2019m studying at a Community College and I\u2019m planning to transfer to Fordham in Spring 2023 to study at the Information Technology and Systems program. I just care to have the BS degree honestly, and going to try to get as much credit counted as possible. \n\nI just wanted to hear from someone. What do you guys think about the PCS and is it worth pursuing any program? Especially because of the amount that they\u2019re asking for a credit. \n\nThe only reason I am talking about Fordham because it is close to me and I\u2019m a commuter. Plus, I\u2019ll work during the school and I can\u2019t go to any other school because they\u2019re far. \n\nThanks a lot for the answers.",

I\u2019m finishing up degree through pcs have a lot of aid though from taking 14hrs a semester so I only have to spend $300-600 semester for tuition outside of it. School will often give you aid if you\u2019re not financially well off\u2026which in my case is true",

    "postText": "I just received my decision as a fall 23 transfer, I was accepted! However,there\u2019s no information on merit aid or total COA and it says all decisions/packages for transfers are delivered online, where usually aid packages are delivered in mail for first years. Any idea where I could find this information or see if I received any merit aid at all? Thanks.",

Call financial aid or log into your Fordham account (set it up if needed). Search for the financial aid section and you will see the aid being offered, or if there is none you will also see that. Make sure you submitted it. I did that mistake and got my aid offer way later.",

I couldn\u2019t find any information or aid offers so we called and the woman said that it\u2019s still under review and I should get a decision by early June. I wonder how common that is",

So idk why it\u2019s taking so long for u. I also submitted my fafsa in the beginning of February so idk if that did anything",

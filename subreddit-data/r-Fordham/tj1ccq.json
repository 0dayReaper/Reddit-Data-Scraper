    "postText": "I recently got admitted into class of 2026 for lc and I really like the opportunities Fordham offers + the location is perfect. I would have to pay around 36K a year with financial aid but  no scholarships, would it be worth it for a future pre-med student? My other options are SUNYs which are way cheaper but I really would rather study at Fordham, but at the same time is it really worth 36K a year? Anything I can do about lowering that cost? Current/former students please lmk.",

Sure, there's plenty of courses that might be worth it such as neuroscience and anatomy, but other places offer the same classes at better levels. The school just lacks the resources. It's much more worth it to go somewhere like Cornell, or Duke. \n\nbtw your rabbit is ugly af",

    "postText": "Even if you can only answer 1 or 2 that would be great!\n\n1. How is the Polisci department? Anything glaringly awful that I need to be aware of?\n2. What are the internship opportunities like for a polisci or IR student? I know that the UN is headquartered in NYC, does Fordham make it easy to work/intern there?\n3. What is it like for minorities on the Rose Hill campus? Specifically black people. As for broader NYC I'm not worried at all, but just on campus are there a lot of racial minorities or no?\n4. How active are clubs? Are they a key part of your social life at the school?\n5. What is the foreign language instruction like? I want to minor in a foreign language so just wondering how this would go over at Fordham.\n6. Is it worth the cost?\n7. What is it like for students of faiths other than Christianity? Will I be forced to engage in activities that are forbidden in my faith simply due to the fact that the school is very jesuit? Is it obligatory to go to their church and do things there?\n8. Lc or Rh?",

            "comment": "6) IMO no, it\u2019s one of the most expensive schools in the country for average education and some of the worst food you will ever put in your mouth.\n7) Zero faith requirements whatsoever, besides having to take 2 religion based classes throughout ur whole time enrolled.\n8) depends on the environment u want. LC is in Manhattan so u get to live in the actual urban part of the city, RH is in the Bronx, so u get to experience what it\u2019s like to not be able to go off campus alone at night. Additionally LC is far more \u201cliberal\u201d u could say, with it being the more artsy campus.",

            "comment": "1. Pretty good, the quality of intro courses can vary based on professor but the upper courses are usually really engaging\n\n2. Internships are available in NY but you've gotta hustle for them. Professors aren't just handing out spots at the UN or in congressional offices.\n\n4. Depends on the club. Some clubs consume/become your entire social life, others meet once a month or something and you forget you're in them until you get an email.\n\n5. You can definitely minor in a foreign language at Fordham \n\n6. I thought so. The more you put into Fordham the more you get out. People who treat it like a state school for rich kids probably won't feel like they got their money's worth. \n\n7. No one is forced to do anything contrary to their faith, you don't have to go to mass or anything. You will have to take a theology course or two which often have Christian perspectives but they are academic courses not religious instruction.\n\n8. RH is the more traditional college experience, LC is great if you wanted to go to NYU but got wait-listed.",

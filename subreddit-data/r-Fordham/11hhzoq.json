Aside from that I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other full ride scholarships? The presidential scholarship goes for up to 20k though!\n\nFinancial aid is generally decent, most people I know here (internationals included) have at least something, but they will make sure you\u2019re paying at least 20k a year at the end of the day. For me that 20k is just housing.",

It\u2019s rare and most don\u2019t get it through a singular program like the Cunniffe (or HEOP but I don\u2019t think OP would be eligible) but rather through a combination of awards like National Merit and the Fordham Housing Fund. It is not unheard of to pay less that 10k per year for your education, including food, housing etc. That\u2019s around how much I pay, not including my work study.",

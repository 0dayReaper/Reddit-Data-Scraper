    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming senior at Fordham, and throughout the years I have been SHOCKED at how many people just throw money at the Fordham bookstore without knowing there's an easier/cheaper way. So here's a hopefully helpful guide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow to get your list of textbooks\n\n\\- You should be registered for classes already, if you're not, uuuhh.. talk to your dean? Log into [my.fordham.edu](https://my.fordham.edu) and in the student tab, you'll see your classes. Furthermore, if you go into the registration portal and click to see your schedule, you'll get a more detailed view. The detailed view will be needed to get the section number if you are taking a class with many sections. If you are a freshman, this is most likely the case.\n\n\\- Once you have your classes, and the section number, go to the fordham bookstore. [https://fordham-rosehill.bncollege.com/shop/fordham-rosehil/page/find-textbooks](https://fordham-rosehill.bncollege.com/shop/fordham-rosehil/page/find-textbooks)\n\n\\- Here, you will list your campus, and punch in all the classes you are registered for, and then you will get a list of your books. Congrats! DO NOT CHECK OUT ON THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FORDHAM WANTS FROM YOU.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow to buy/get your textbooks\n\n\\- Once you have your list, there will be an ISBN number. Sometimes those ISBNs are specific to fordham. Search the ISBN on google, and get the full name of the textbook. Do this for all your textbooks. I typically make a word doc with the class,  textbooks, and then the name, and then I will write down any other ISBNs that are the same book. Make sure it's the right edition though. \n\n\\- Once you have the title, author, and edition of the book. Log into [libgen.is](https://libgen.is)\n\n\\- From there, try a few variations of the name of the book. Sometimes a textbook has 3 authors, Fordham will list one on the bookstore, but the author on libgen is the 3rd one. If the title is really long, search only the first two/three words and the author. Download the book, and done. Share with your classmates if you feel like being nice. Libgen is free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\"BUT I CAN'T FIND THE BOOK ON LIBGEN\"**\n\nYeah, that happens. The textbook industry sucks. If there's a previous edition (professor wanted the 10th, libgen has the 9th) go ahead and download the 9th, and shoot your professor an email asking if previous editions will work. I've only had an issue twice where I needed the current edition.\n\n**\"I found my book on libgen, but I need an access code\"**\n\nEmail. your. professor. Bookstore says you need an access code, but sometimes the professor won't use it. Also, find out what the access code will be for. I had a class where it was for homework, but homework wasn't part of grade. So I didn't bother getting the access code, and just used the free version on libgen. If you NEED the access code. WAIT. Don't buy the book yet w/ an access code. Your professor will email you to sign up the access code with the class. In that email, you have the option to buy just the access to the homework and an online only copy of the textbook. WileyPlus is like this. Use your PDF from libgen to read, and buy the access code from the email. It's cheaper that way.\n\n**\"Okay, this is helpful, but I still have books I can't find\"**\n\nOkay, so all fails, but hopefully you found SOME of your textbooks on libgen. Now go on Amazon. Amazon rentals are typically cheaper than the bookstore. Also, just start googling. if you google \"Managerial Accounting Wiley Edition 10 .pdf\" you might be able to find it. the \".pdf\" is important. Also, if the book is available on kindle, you can buy it, and theres a way to download it, even if its a rental (google it) and then you can return the book. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully this helps. Don't buy any books until you've seen the syllabus. Email your professors for any textbook questions too. Do NOT go buy at the bookstore though, since it is a complete ripoff. If needed, buy a pdf, and split the cost between other classmates/friends who need the book.",

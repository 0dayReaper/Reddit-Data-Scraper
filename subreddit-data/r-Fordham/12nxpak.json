            "comment": "Hi! First of all, cool user name, love fire emblem. Second, it depends.\n\nCS is one of those majors that it kinda doesn\u2019t matter where you go. Some people don\u2019t even go to college, just boot camps. It\u2019s very much merit based, even with the current market problems, so as long as you\u2019re willing to put in the work you can go anywhere. Prestige helps, but isn\u2019t necessary. \n\nOn the level of prestige, Fordham won\u2019t hurt you but it won\u2019t help you any. The school just isn\u2019t known for it. \n\nWhen it comes to the academics, it varies. Some teachers are fucking awesome (like Dakota Hernandez at Lincoln center, love that man) while others REALLY suck. You just gotta pick good ones based off of rate my professor. You\u2019re going to be doing mainly C++ in classes, which is good for things like embedded systems but a little dated compared to what FAANG uses. Still, it teaches the concepts well! If you want to do research, there\u2019s basically zero opportunities for that at the school, but the career center and teachers will send out links to apply for opportunities at other schools and such, so it\u2019s not all that bad. There\u2019s 1 career fair for STEM students every semester, but the companies that attend aren\u2019t huge (however they\u2019re very eager to work with you). All in all, for academics, it\u2019s a middle of the road program. Not great but not bad either. \n\nIf the school is giving you a lot of money to come here, and is a better financial option than other colleges, I would take it. But if you have the chance to go to fucking like Georgia tech or Berkeley or something choose those. Don\u2019t put yourself into debt for fordham\u2019s CS experience. It\u2019s not a bad program but it\u2019s not worth putting yourself into a hole over.",

That just shows how very not well-known and underdeveloped it is. As someone else mentioned, going to a non-prestigious school isnt gonna hurt u when it comes to CS, and the grades r gonna be easier. However, when I look at my CS friends at other school, they\u2019re doing much more advanced and practical projects and are therefore more experienced, and we barely do any projects here. So if u wanna be competitive when it comes to jobs n stuff, u have to try harder learn everything by urself",

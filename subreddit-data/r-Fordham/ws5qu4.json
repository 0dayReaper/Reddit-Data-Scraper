    "postText": "Hey everyone! I notice a lot of the posts on here are traditionally about the school itself and stuff so I\u2019m sorry if this post is  a bit out of place. I transferred to Fordham this year and super excited to be living in Manhattan for the first time. It\u2019s always been a dream of mine. The point of this post is just to potentially get to know some people before the first days. \n\nI am interested in many things and my favorite part of going to a school like this is to be able to meet a wide variety of people. I love to read and write, listen to and make music, watch &amp; create films, and explore new ideas, wether artistic,  philosophical, or cultural. I am a very spontaneous &amp; social person (ironically lol). I hope to go to many concerts, shows, and museums soon! I tried keeping it brief so the post didn\u2019t become an all about me \ud83d\ude2d\n\nDM me or leave a comment or whatever. Thank you for reading and genuinely, good luck to everybody",

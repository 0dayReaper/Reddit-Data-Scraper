I plan on going and know that tickets are only used if it ends up raining and the ceremony is inside. Do you get to pick where you sit for commencement or is it in like alphabetical order? I haven\u2019t seen many updates about commencement and my friends don\u2019t know any details either. Not sure what to expect but can any alumni shed light on this?",

Do not stand next to them on the double line.  These lines will divide after they process up the aisle and are ready to be seated:  the left line taking the left seats, the right taking the right.]\n\nSame for other schools one after the other till all schools are seated.\n\nFor guests, there is seating similar to that for the graduated with a barricade separating the two groups. The guest seating area is located behind the student section.  After the University  Commencement Ceremony, when students of other schools and their guests move to the locations for their Diploma Ceremonies, your guests may move up to take any vacated seats in the guest seating area only; they may not enter the student section.",

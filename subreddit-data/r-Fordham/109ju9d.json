Our class focused a lot on changes in artistic expression as a metric for historical changes. They assume you know little to nothing about European history coming into the class. Definitely recommend.",

I loved my UHC modern europe course, as honestly the professor that taught me was absolutely a 10/10. devoted to the material, charismatic, and overall incredibly helpful and willing to chat. anyways you will learn the french revolution, capitalism, and 20th century stuff. IT depends on your professors though.",

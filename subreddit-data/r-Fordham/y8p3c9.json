    "postText": "Hi y\u2019all so basically I failed a class last semester. Rlly unfortunate cause my GPA was decent. I had failed because I had COVID and wasn\u2019t able to keep up because I had been really Ill and out for almost a month of school. Anyways, I failed a class and I know online it says that if I retake the class I can\u2019t replace the F. Do you know if I email a dean or anyone important that they can set up a meeting with me to work it out or is that just wishful thinking? Hate my gpa as of right now idk how I\u2019m ever going to get in law school",

I did speak to the dean and my advisor and they told me to send one more email and add them to it. I did that and she still told me I couldn\u2019t make up the word :/",

It will get fixed.    \n\n\nHowever, if there's more to this story that you're not revealing, then obviously you're pooched.  To be honest I'm a little suspicious because Fordham is hyper-obsessed with COVID and community safety (one of only 15-ish schools in the country with a booster mandate this Fall) and so for a Dean to just do nothing while a prof says \"sorry COVID kid, you fail\" seems like it can't be the whole story?  But again if it's the whole story then you can *definitely* get the grade reversed.",

Granted I probably spoke to someone who wasn\u2019t as knowledgeable but it\u2019s fucking Covid you would think by now they\u2019d have their shit together.\n\nSo yeah I\u2019m in the same boat as OP praying my professors will cut me some slack on assignment due dates because I basically lost 2 weeks of cognition to write grad papers. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is you would assume the school has some type of concrete Covid policy like I\u2019d did but they proved me wrong",

She was very understanding and I can tell she felt bad that my prof didn\u2019t let me make up these assignments. She told me not to worry about it and just retake the class and it will be resolved. Which I can\u2019t do because school is the only thing I really care about so trying to forget about it is really hard. Should I set up another appointment with her ?",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I was curious if anyone here could share their experiences working as an Adjunct at Fordham. I was offered a position to adjunct there this summer and I\u2019m debating whether or not I should accept. The pay is a bit lower than my previous adjunct positions, but the campus looks beautiful and it sounds like a neat opportunity. Alternatively, if you\u2019ve taken classes taught by adjunct profs, what has that been like?",

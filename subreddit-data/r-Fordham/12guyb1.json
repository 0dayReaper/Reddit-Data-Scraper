If you're looking to get some graduation photos as the weather improves and the big day comes up, feel free to reach out to me on Instagram or any contact methods on my Instagram page. Looking forward to working with you and helping to capture the memories of this special milestone!\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/jtjphotography/](https://www.instagram.com/jtjphotography/)",

    "postText": "\"**I am pleased to share with you the news that Fordham is preparing to offer the full range of in-person instruction and on-campus activities this fall.** The federal government now projects that every adult in the United States will have access to the COVID-19 vaccine by this summer. Therefore, we anticipate that many of the COVID-19 constraints under which we operate today will be relaxed as the pandemic subsides following mass vaccination efforts.\"",

            "comment": "I wish we could just have a hybrid model, especially since so many students are used to online/prefer it and don\u2019t want to have to travel to and from campus and would prefer to stay home (if they\u2019re home now). Also since Fordham\u2019s already invested so much into having an online infrastructure for the online classes it doesn\u2019t make sense why they\u2019d give that up instead of giving more flexibility for the students",

    "postText": "Hi all, I'm gonna be starting a PhD program in Fordham in the Fall. Couple of questions: \n\n1. Are there any online/social media groups for either Fordham grad students or NYC grad students? \n2. If I'm hoping to move to NYC in early August\u2014when should I start inquiring about apartments? I've already done some browsing but it seems that as of now, most landlords don't want to wait until August.\n3. Any insider tips for finding reasonable apartments in NYC? My stipend is not all that much, so the cheaper the better. \n\nThanks, super excited!",

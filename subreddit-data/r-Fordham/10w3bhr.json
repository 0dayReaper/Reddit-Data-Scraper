            "comment": "Instead of getting into semantics about statistics and anecdotes, the honest answer is that it depends. \n\nStudents that do good work and do their best to network early/often will have better outcomes than those that are on the opposite side of the coin. I know people that are doing incredibly well for themselves and managing to continue to make upward movement where they have been since graduating. But, I also know people who are at places that they could have landed a job with if they went to a state school for a third of the cost of Fordham. At the end of the day, opportunities are there if you\u2019re willing to put in the work, but they certainly won\u2019t be handed to you.",

Every single high performer I knew got at least one 6 fig offer at places like Citi, JPM, MS, Goldman, etc. if you plan on being avg that\u2019s a totally diff picture, and as others said, Fordham itself doesn\u2019t get you the job",

            "comment": "Let me put it this way, outside of New York, Gabelli is a pretty lowkey name. I went to Chicago for a Goldman event and I told the analysts we networked with where I went and they were oblivious to what Fordham or Gabelli even is. Nevertheless, you need to do whatever you can to standout from the crowd. That\u2019s not to say that Gabelli is a bad school in new york, but when you\u2019re competing with kids from columbia, stern, dyson, you\u2019re pretty much bringing a nerf gun to war. Gabelli\u2019s alumni base is definitely growing rapidly and we\u2019re being better represented on wall street as the years go, but right now, you need to stand out.",

If you work hard, maintain a 3.7+ GPA, build a network, and are sociable you\u2019ll have no trouble securing top tier internships and a high paying job after graduation. For myself and most of my friends, that meant 6 figure salaries at top tier banks or high 5 figure salaries at the Big4. With that being said, if you get complacent and your grades fall, you\u2019ll probably end up much closer to a median post-graduation job and salary (which is also totally fine!) Just set clear goals early on and don\u2019t settle until they\u2019re met. Feel free to PM if you have additional questions/want me to elaborate more!",

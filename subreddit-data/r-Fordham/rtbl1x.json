    "postText": "Hate to be that guy, but COVID is still here in full swing. Hospitals in NYC are going on diversion again because they\u2019re full, more and more people are testing positive, etc. \n\nWhat do you think will happen for Spring 2022? I know Fordham just said study abroad is still on a few days ago, and it seems like they\u2019re preparing for us all to come back, but things are getting worse seemingly everyday. \n\nPersonally, I hope they put some stuff online. The end of last semester was already a shitshow with finals happening and the positive case rate spiking, and it\u2019s not gonna be much better when people get back from vacation.\n\nEDIT: I work in healthcare and I can tell you that our hospitals are getting overwhelmed again. There are vaccinated and boosted people in the ERs too and several of our hospitals have less than 10% capacity remaining. Omicron spreads incredibly easily in comparison to the original SARS-CoV-2. I genuinely hope Fordham is able to have us back in person safely, but I don\u2019t know how feasible that is.",

So it has to be something that is pretty much all or nothing.  I think they will probably go with the first 2-4 weeks online then move to in person.",

Fordham is taking all necessary steps to keep the campus environment safe.  It will most likely be all in-person. \nIf the students keep the indoor partying to a minimum we should all be fine. \nAny vaccinated person getting the virus has very mild symptoms. Hospitalizations are not that high. The problem is that many healthcare workers that tested positive have to quarantine and many healthcare workers were let go because they would not get the vaccine, leaving the hospitals short staffed. \nThe commuting students should be the most concerned due to exposure on public transportation.  Again, vaccination and booster will protect them but they could possibly bring it home to a loved one that is not vaccinated.",

My dad suggested marking that I\u2019m willing to be considered without housing but will that give me a better chance overall or will that mess up my chances of getting housing? I cannot commute.",

            "comment": "so I graduated in 2014 so take what I have with a grain of salt here, could easily be outdated--\n\nthere are a lot of off campus apartments available within walking distance. When I was there, they were often priced similarly or even lower than on-campus housing, unless you were looking to live alone. However as a freshman idk if either option is ideal; finding a roommate will be hard/sketchy and living in the dorms as a non-commuter is the easiest way to make friends. \n\nI don't know how much checking that \"ok without housing\" box matters. I'd be pretty hopeful if you were waitlisted of at least getting in, though 1) you may not get great financial aid and 2) depending on where you are on the list,  there is achance you don't find out until over the summer and will have a deposit/plans already made for your backup school. Just speaking from my experience--like 1/2 of my dorm had been told they were tripling, then within the 2 weeks before school that got changed to double (1 roommate) and by 2 weeks into the school year a bunch of people had already dropped out of school or housing, opening up slots for people without housing or people to get into nicer dorms. A lot of kids who were accepted will end up not going to Fordham, or putting deposits down at 2 schools, eventually cancelling and opening up a slot for you.",

My dad argued that marking that will give me a better admissions chance which is probably right, but I honestly don\u2019t know if I\u2019d accept an offer without housing. Is it possible to try and receive housing after theoretically getting that offer? I just didn\u2019t want to be immediately put in a pile of people who said without housing.",

Plus, living off campus will definitely be a different experience than other freshmen. So much bonding happens in the dorms and you will miss out on it. Since COVID they aren\u2019t even allowing visitors in the dorms. If those rules are still in place you can\u2019t even hang out with friends in their rooms.  Living off campus is very popular but it is more for the upperclassmen.",

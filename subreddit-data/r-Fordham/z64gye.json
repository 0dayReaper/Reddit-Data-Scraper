Some of them aren\u2019t worth much or are long-shots to get but they can add up. Unfortunately Fordham only does half-stack with outside scholarships so they\u2019ll only let you keep half of the scholarship and the other half deducts your financial aid if that makes sense. You can also always appeal a financial aid offer, especially if a comparable university gives you a much better deal. I\u2019d look into financial aid appeal letters online to find some templates. I have at least one friend who got a lot more money from Fordham after doing that.",

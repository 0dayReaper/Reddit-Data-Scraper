    "postText": "Do students usually take an ICC course that is related to their major? I am asking because there are not many courses related to my major, so I'll either have to take one unrelated to my major or wait and hope there are more courses next semester. I'm mostly worried I won't have a strong enough foundation for whichever course I decide to take; for example, say I take a course when I have never taken a lower-level class in that subject. Should I stick to familiar subjects?",

            "comment": "No, it doesn't need to be related to your major. I personally enjoyed taking classes outside of my major throughout college when fulfilling the cores. I'm taking an English class called Empire + Sexuality next semester for my ICC, and I'm a communications major. If the topic sounds interesting, consider it! I don't think for any of these they expect you to have background knowledge. I think it's good to get out of your comfort zone and learn something new, college is all about learning and stepping outside of those boundaries.",

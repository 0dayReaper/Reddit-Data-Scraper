I\u2019m writing a piece for the Observer on mental health at Fordham (both campuses) and would like to hear your experiences. I can give you more info about the story if ur interested. It can be anonymous or not, whatever y\u2019all prefer. We can talk in person, over the phone or zoom, or I can just email you questions. My email is alane19@fordham.edu and my number is (631) 807-9882. I\u2019d like to get the interviews done this week so don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. Thanks in advance :)",

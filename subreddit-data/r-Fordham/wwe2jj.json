Like what if you genuinely can\u2019t go because of certain circumstances? \n\nAnd for those who did attend \u2014 were the groups small and do they check every hour or something like that if everyone\u2019s here?",

Just stick through the events during the day it will help you meet people and become acquainted with campus life.\n\nIts not worth having to repeat or go over any of this crap later. If your OL is chill, you'll have chances to sneak off during some stuff.",

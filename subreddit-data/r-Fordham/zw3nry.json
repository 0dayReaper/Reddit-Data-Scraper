    "postText": "\n\nLocal Bronx family (near Arthur Ave/187) seeks a part-time babysitter to watch a joyful, energetic toddler during the spring semester (January - May).\n\nAbout Us: We are a SAHM + medical resident with a toddler and another baby on the way (due in February). NYBG + Zoo members/frequent visitors. Our toddler boy is very into music, trains, Disney, coloring, trains, and loves to go on walks, and ride trains. We are all fully vaxxed, and have a sweet ginger cat.\n\nAbout You: Fordham student (any major), preferably with an interest in music and silliness, who also enjoys going for walks and talking about trains. Fully vaxxed (including bivalent booster, current flu shot, willing to get TDAP) and not allergic to cats.\n\nVery flexible hours - work around your class schedule and workload. Please DM me if you\u2019re interested.",

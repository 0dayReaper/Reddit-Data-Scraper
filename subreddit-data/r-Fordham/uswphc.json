    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nFCRH '26 here. Going to start in the fall... \n\nI've seen a lot of good and bad things about Fordham on the internet, and I am kind of spooked regarding the bad. When I visited, the campus was amazing, and I got a good vibe. But some of the things I've read online make it seem like Fordham is god-awful. Are the classrooms miserable? Is the food really horrible? Are the professors helpful? Is the social environment unbearable? \n\nI am fearful of the negative things I have seen online, and I am wondering if anyone who is happy at Fordham now could share some things they like about the school. Because right now, I feel sort of lost. Any positivity/specifics would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks so much.",

            "comment": "I think what makes up for those bad things (maybe not so much at Rosehill bc I'm biased) is the crazy memories and cool friends you can make it hope you're there. Given it's by the city you'll have the chance to do cool things and meet new ppl. Tbh I think it just depends on the person if you're going to like RH, I've heard some things that I don't align with about there but also I'm not the type of person to go to RH-- but my point still stands that you can make good memories . Good luck",

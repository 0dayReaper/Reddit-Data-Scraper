            "comment": "wow the other replies are bitter\u2026 i\u2019m not going to try to convince you to go to fordham or to go to another school but to answer your actual question to the best of my abilities, i know a few poli-sci majors all at LC, but each of them took at least a class or two at rose hill. i believe that major is pretty interchangeable between campuses, so it\u2019s more about what kind of vibe you want when choosing which campus.\n\ni started at rose hill because i wanted a real campus vibe but i am not a party person and i didn\u2019t want to go out to bars, so i found that the campus was dead every weekend and i was so bored. i actually transferred to lincoln center after my first semester. for me, it was better to be in the middle of nyc. it was easier for me to get out and have fun because everything i wanted to do was in manhattan and at LC, i didn\u2019t need to take a 45 minute subway ride to get there. there are still bars  and clubs around if you\u2019re into that, but there are also so many restaurants and coffee shops and bookstores and museums and karaoke bars and so much more. i also still took a class at rose hill every couple of semesters because i still loved being on that campus, i just didn\u2019t want to live there (so this is not me trashing RH at all because i actually love being there)\n\nas for the people at each campus, idk what one of these replies is about with LC people being weirdos. i made a lot of friends there and found almost everyone to be super friendly and easy to talk to.",

            "comment": "IMO, a lot of the \u201cclassical\u201d polisci classes like Enlightenment-era political theory and philosophy are held at Rose Hill, whereas Lincoln Center has many more international relations-focused classes like the UN, intro to international politics, etc. You will, of course, have access to major-related courses at both campuses, if you don\u2019t mind the commute between LC and RH.\n\nFordham has a great political science curriculum, and I never found myself facing a lack of courses to choose. There may be times when you might have difficulty creating a schedule that includes all of the polisci classes you want to take with the other core classes necessary for graduation that doesn\u2019t completely suck in terms of timing (especially if you plan on commuting). But it\u2019s doable.",

            "comment": "I am not familiar with the political science major specifically, but I did start out at LC and transferred to RH after my first semester. LC is in a great location and the freshman dorm (McKeon) was a beautiful place to live, but the class size is very small and the campus is missing a community feel. I got sick of having all of my classes in the same building, and I ultimately wanted more of a college campus feel with close proximity to the city, so I transferred to RH. The internal transfer process was super easy and the school is very supportive, so don't sweat the decision too much. I would just really think about what you want out of your campus, and if you show up and don't like it, give the other campus a chance!",

CS major and I\u2019m not sure if I can even finish my major classes by the time I\u2019m supposed to graduate.",

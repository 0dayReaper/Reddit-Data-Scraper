    "postText": "I thought Fordham had their own standard way of evaluating the A-F scale in numerical format for final grades, like how an A typically starts at 93. One of my professors this semester made it so an A is a 95 and above which left me with an A- (I had a 94 average). This definitely stung because I was so close to having a 4.0, and I would have on the traditional scale. I just never had a professor that changed it to fit their own scale. But I guess it's allowed?",

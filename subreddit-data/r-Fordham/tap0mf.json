    "postText": "Recently watched the new Batman movie and I really enjoyed it, especially cat woman in it. Movie has inspired me to try to find a cat girl gf. Anybody know where I could? Tried mugz but no luck, feel like Reddit is the best place to ask. DM if you\u2019re a cat girl and interested or if you have a friend who\u2019s a cat girl (I\u2019m more likely to respond if you look like Zoe Kravitz btw).",

Like a pretty severe kind of autism. Some in my family go to like 75% of this guy, so it's not hard to imagine this being genuine. It could also be a troll though, but I don't get why anyone would do that. \n\nAlso your first question sounded/looked genuine to me so idk what that guy was talking about, maybe just a bit jaded from too long on the internet etc.\n\nEdit: I spent way too much time reading almost all this guy's posts and comments, and because he likely is a troll, that's probably exactly what he wants. I simply just don't understand why anyone would go through all that trouble and spend time keeping up a charade, which isn't even funny mind you, just to bait people into reading/responding. Maybe he is really 19 and very lonely and this is how he gets attention? Idk maybe the autism of others has rubbed off on me or something.. \n\nAnyway OP seek help please and thank you.",

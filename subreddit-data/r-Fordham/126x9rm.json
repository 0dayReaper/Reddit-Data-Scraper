    "postText": "I wasn\u2019t formally declared an English major and now a friend student I wouldn\u2019t be able to register until I do. So I sent the associate head my declaration form but I\u2019m so worried it won\u2019t go thru in time for registration. For me it\u2019s on the 14th so I guess I have time but we have Easter break where the school would be closed. What should I do?",

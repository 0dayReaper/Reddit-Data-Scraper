But, you have senior week leading up to it so u can pre-move some stuff. \n\nAs someone who was not from the Northeast, the way Fordham handles move-out in general has always been a strong irk for me it seems designed around people who can load up a uhaul and move immediately somewhere, not for people who have to fly across the country and figure out the logistics of  storage companies.",

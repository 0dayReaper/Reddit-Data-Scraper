    "postText": "I\u2019ve been accepted to RH 2027, but I really want the honors college. I understand that it is a very selective program but I meet the posted ranges of act and gpa, along with LOTS of service (Girl scout silver and gold awards) Collegeboard national small town scholar recognition and four years of Varsity swim team captain.\n\nI will say that I haven\u2019t submitted my FAFSA or CSS yet (extension was filed for 2021) so I don\u2019t know any of my scholarship info. \n\nWere honors applicants already selected? Should I contact the program to follow up for further consideration? Is my lack of financial documents a factor? \n\nFordham is unequivocally my top choice, but what would really seal the deal for me is honors college admittance. What can I do?",

The only cool thing you get is access to a one room schoolhouse on campus. I felt the same way when I got accepted, but don\u2019t worry.",

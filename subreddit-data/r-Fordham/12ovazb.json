            "comment": "My sister went to Fordham for CS and had to transfer out because there simply is no recruitment and no opportunities/good outcomes from fordham for CS majors. There\u2019s little to no resources and no support because a lot of the stuff you learn is outdated (no python, java, etc\u2026 you\u2019re learning mostly C++ which isn\u2019t as applicable nowadays for FAANG). If you can go relatively cheap freshman year and can bang it out of the park by building a good portfolio, joining programs like J.p. morgan\u2019s freshman CS program, start some clubs outside of school, good gpa, etc, i\u2019d recommend transferring to a better place that has a bigger CS program like Stony Brook (low tier example) or UNC/Berkeley/UVA (higher tier example).",

I am coming in as a transfer student from a community college. I have two options Hunter or Fordham. I\u2019m leaning more towards Fordham, since I visited Hunter and things look pretty bad over there. What do you think I should choose? I would like to do a accelerated masters at Fordham since I am already 23. I don\u2019t wait think I really have the option of transferring with my credits.",

Hunter is a shit show as far as administration goes, but their curriculum is intellectually challenging and are up to recent SWE trends like python and java. Hunter\u2019s premed program places in Harvard, Stanford, and other top med schools year over year (stay with me i\u2019m going somewhere with this point), which just shows that their curriculum is hard enough and students there are extremely smart. The cons of hunter is that it\u2019s an easy cuny to get into, but a hard cuny to not get weeded out of. The school\u2019s professors are insanely talented and well established in their field so if you actually do the work and work your living ass off, you\u2019ll do well. Building an incredible portfolio and doing ECs and CS research is extremely important and being in the city, you\u2019ll get that from both universities.\n\nIf Fordham is cheap for you, then go for it, but if you want a challenging curriculum with established alums within the field, go to hunter. I will say that both schools have little to no resources so its hard to choose.",

Myself and a couple of peers landed SWE roles but only because we went out our way to put in the work (personal projects, research, getting summer internships). The career center people don\u2019t know how to prepare you for technical interviews so that\u2019s a bust. You won\u2019t get a job with the knowledge you get from the CS program here alone. What\u2019s insane to me is that they allow students to graduate without some kind of experience under their belt. No internship or research requirement so many are left struggling to get jobs after they graduate.",

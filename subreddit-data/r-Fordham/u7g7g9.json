    "postText": " Hello fellow college students! (and people looking to stay in the area)!\n\nI would like to sublet my place in the UWS for the summer. I rent a room in a two bedroom apartment, but the other room is unoccupied - making this essentially a single bedroom for the price of splitting a 2 bed. I would be gone from mid may to the beginning of September. The apartment is located on west 107th, with good access to 1, c and b trains and great dining. $1400 all included, PM for details",

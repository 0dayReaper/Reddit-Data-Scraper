What did I do wrong exactly? I walked into the dorm building on the LC campus without a mask on during the second semester of last year. I simply forgot as i was carrying multiple boxes. That's it... literally! I forgot to put a mask on when I walked through the front door. Someone reminded me within no joke 4 seconds of walking in, I then put it on. However, a bitch RA saw me walk in and she reported me. What an absolute bitch, fucking with my academic integrity because I forgot to wear a mask for a few seconds. Due to the fact I did literally nothing which had 0 effect on anyone in any identifiable way, I'm still shocked how terribly they treated me. Fuck public safety.",

    "postText": "Hi there! Easygoing gay 32-year-old digital marketer here looking for a room or studio ASAP in June. Prefer furnished with a bed, but not a deal-breaker if unfurnished. Looking to stay in Manhattan below 150th, Astoria/LIC/Sunnyside or close, and Williamsburg if possible. Open to just June, or longer. Please feel free to reach out if any questions. Thank you!",

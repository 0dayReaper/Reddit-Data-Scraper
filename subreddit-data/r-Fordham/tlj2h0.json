I have a girlfriend that goes to LC and I would love her to sleepover in Walsh when it\u2019s hard for her to commute back during late hours. What r some ways to have her stay overnight? Also if I have a friend as an RA in the building would that help? Thank u :)",

Sign her into the building as a guest, then significantly later, walk back down with her and sign her out, but give her your room key beforehand. Once she is signed out, she walks up to your room and lets herself in while you walk outside. Loiter for 20 mins or so, then let yourself back in using your ID. Head upstairs and knock to have her let you in, and you\u2019re fine. She has \u201cleft\u201d without leaving.",

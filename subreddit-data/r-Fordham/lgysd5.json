    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure if anyone else is having this problem but I log into IMLeagues to sign up for the gym everyday at 12:00 on the dot and there\u2019s already 200 slots taken. Like holy shit. These kids have to be using bots. It\u2019s fucking outrageous. Going to the gym is easily the highlight of my day almost everyday and I\u2019m pissed. AND When I do get a slot, there\u2019s never 25 people in ram fit. If you\u2019re using a bot of some kind, fuck off, and if you sign up for a slot and don\u2019t actually go, also fuck off. Thank you.",

I\u2019m not 100% sure when the deadline is, but it seems that from the convos that I\u2019ve had with the financial office, they probably want it pretty soon as they told me to send it to them last week. But you should probably still reach out to them just in case!\n\nAlso, I had the same issues when trying to accept my rewards.

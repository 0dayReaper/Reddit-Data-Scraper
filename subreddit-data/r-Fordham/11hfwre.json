I am gravitating toward accepting my offer but was wondering how is the on-campus job situation for international students and if there is a policy of any kind that prohibits students from working as a freelancer as means of earning.\n\nAny help would be appreciated",

(used to be ground floor queens court). ram van driver? (your license/work status depending).\n\nhonestly i\u2019d inquire at the botanical garden and zoo. i had a fun, decent paying job at the garden running the tour trolley for a bit. pugsli\u2019s is worth a shot, and if you can bartend - well, those spots typically require a connection, but what the heck. \n\ni\u2019m sure i\u2019m missing things, but other than what i\u2019ve mentioned i think you\u2019d need to look in manhattan. i tended bar downtown junior and senior years and loved the break from campus. and the money. metro north Fordham stop to 125 or grand central, or ram van (less dependable and comfortable). i don\u2019t really recommend the subway (D or 4 trains), especially at night. i got mugged on the D first semester freshman year. 0/10. \n\ngood luck!",

In the caee of Fordham, it has special rule that you can only work max at 19 hours per week. I have seen a number of posts (both email and posters around the campus) on vacancies. Actually, I can say there are a lot - driver, admin staff for offices like alumni and international center, labs, etc. Note that I am in LC campus. \n\nPay range from $15-$20 depending on the office. \n\nSend me a message if you have further questions.",

            "comment": "Even if you don't care about Fordham sports at all, you should be happy about this.\n\nNeubauer was one of the highest paid employees at Fordham, likely netting between $500-$750k a year. During the six years he overstayed his welcome at Fordham, we never once sniffed .500 in conference play and won a total of one post-season game. Along the way, he absolutely squandered a plethora of recruits who went onto tournament caliber teams, and in the case of Eric Paschal, the NBA. \n\nFordham men's basketball has been an embarassment to the university on the national stage, and students owe it to themselves to hold the administration accountable for making such terrible decisions and running the program into the ground. Not just because they do or do not like basketball, but because it is administrative ineptitude on a grand scale. We fund these programs to the tune of millions a year and they return less than nothing. Either we should play the game or drop to DIII, but not light the hard earned tuition money of our students on fire.",

All athletic programs should be put very closely under the microscope to see the extent to which they raise the profile of the school or have the potential to generate revenue. \n\nThere are definitely things they could do and don't, but athletics are likely not the reason for it. There are however changes they could make to athletics that would better the whole school. \n\nI know very, very few people on this board are even aware we have a football team, but we do. And we budget ~7-8 million dollars a year for a middling FCS football team. Largely to engage the alumni of the program, and those who are old enough to remember when Fordham was one of the nations dominant teams. When we recruited coach Joe Moorhead to lead the team, we saw what was likely the pinnacle of this setup. A second round playoff in the college football minor leagues, and one national TV highlight reel when we beat a struggling Army team at home in front of 20k embarrassed cadets. Those were some of my fondest memories of my time at Fordham, but what good did they do the school? Attendance at home games was 6k, but there were no TV deals, no long lasting effect on enrollment (vis a vis the Flutie Effect), and nobody cared. That's the way the FCS goes.\n\nThere are athletics programs that are revenue neutral or positive, but right now, we have none. I've thought for years that a viable path forward would be to axe the football program entirely, and devote the capital to actually building a nationally competitive basketball team. This model has worked for many comparable low-major Catholic schools: Loyola Chicago, St. Joesphs, St. Bonaventure, Butler, Creighton, etc. Those programs keep alumni plugged into the school, and with them, their wallets. We can have that here at Fordham, we just choose not to play the dirty games that comes with big time sports. We've done that over our whole history. \n\nEvery time a coach is fired, it represents a possible inflection point. But with the rumors I'm seeing that we're willing to give the next guy even more money in the hopes that we can \"right the ship\" without the major capital investment needed to compete in the A-10, my expectation is I'll be reading another one of these posts in seven years.",

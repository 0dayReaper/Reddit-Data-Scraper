It\u2019s apparently one of the most haunted campuses in all of america, my RD and some security guards who have worked there have told me stories. but tbh I\u2019m wondering if anything has happened to any students. I\u2019ve heard screaming and the lights always turn on and off by themselves while we were on winter break according to my RD.",

            "comment": "FCRH from the 90s just happened to see this thread because I was looking to see if anyone was discussing basketball. \n\nThere\u2019s a few ties between fordham and the movie the exorcist. If you\u2019ve ever seen the movie there\u2019s a scene at the end where a priest gives last rights to a guy who fell down the stairs. The stairs are in Georgetown in Dc if you\u2019re ever there. That priest was a real priest who taught at Fordham. It looks like he\u2019s involved in an abuse scandal. But that\u2019s not what this story is about.\n\nIn the 90s Hughes hall was a freshman dorm. \n\nEvery Halloween the priest would give a lecture about the movie. It was in the basement of Hughes because some scenes were shot there. What it was like shooting it, exorcisms, etc. Then it was Fordham ghost story time.\n\nThe priest ended up revealing that one scene was actually shot in Hughes hall in what was now a dorm room. It\u2019s a scene where the main characters are sitting at the end of their beds talking to each other. He indicated that the room was now allegedly haunted by a baby\u2019s ghost. I\u2019m not bullshitting when I say that two girls gasped loudly. They had a friend confirm that since moving in they\u2019d asked several people up and down their hall if they heard a baby crying at night or if someone had brought a kid in. They asked which room it was shot in and he said 4th floor, right in the middle, facing dealy. Everyone who knew the two girls knew it was the exact room. I want to say that it being in the center gave it an extra window compared to the rest of the 4th floor rooms which is why it\u2019s recognizable in the film.",

            "comment": "well it\u2019s only my first year here but I constantly feel like I\u2019m being stared at when I\u2019m walking back to my dorm at night so I\u2019m always looking back to see if anyone\u2019s there but nope. You\u2019d also hear knocks on your closet door sometimes and sudden bangs on the ceiling (probably plumbing issues) but still it freaks me out sometimes. The lights flicker from time to time and next the doors would be open even though they were closed initially. \n\nSometimes I would hear a girl or a kid screaming in the halls but I always thought that was the wind (but how would wind get in the halls?) that\u2019s the thing. I kinda low key came to Fordham because I love horror and ghost hunting so I\u2019ve been enjoying it a lot. Not sure if others feel the same way.",

My lights would actually physically turn off while I was still in the room (like light switches flicked off), I\u2019d hear  things moving the hangers around in my closet, and I ALWAYS felt like I was being watched. Whenever I\u2019d sit in bishops to do homework at night I would see people walking towards me out of the corner of my eye but most of the time there wouldn\u2019t be anyone there. And then sophomore year when I lived in ohare it all just stopped, I think because it was a newer building. So yeah, fully believe the place is haunted",

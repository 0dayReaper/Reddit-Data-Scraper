    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am an incoming student for the Masters in Computer Science program at Fordham University for the fall of 2023. I am very excited to begin my studies, but I have some concerns about the program and the university. As you might know, Fordham University is not widely known for its computer science program, and I would like to know if the program is good and if I will receive quality education.\n\nFurthermore, I am interested in knowing about the Indian community at the Lincoln Center campus. As an Indian student, I would like to know if there are many Indian students enrolled in the program, and if there is an active Indian community on campus. I believe that this will make my transition to the university much easier and help me feel more at home.\n\nI would appreciate any information you can provide about the Masters in Computer Science program at Fordham University and the Indian community at the Lincoln Center campus. Thank you in advance for your help!",

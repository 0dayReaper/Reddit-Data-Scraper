    "postText": "I really want to go to Gabelli at LC but I didnt do a lot of research when I applied so I applied to Gabelli at RH. After visiting I really loved LC and did not like RH. I tried transferring but they said I couldn\u2019t. My other option is NYU Shanghai which I like because it\u2019s more diverse and it\u2019s more like LC than RH where it\u2019s not a traditional campus at all which love. Of course the problem that it\u2019s in China and I\u2019ve never even been to asia and my parents would prefer me not to go to China. I also want to work in the business side of the entertainment industry and NY would be a lot better for that. So yeah I don\u2019t know what to do any advice would be great.",

I meant it more so to help OP avoid a potentially difficult culture shock since they said that they\u2019ve never been. However, that obviously doesn\u2019t justify my comment being crude and offensive. Again, I wanna sincerely apologize everyone! Sorry for being ignorant and coming off as an ass.",

Maybe a bit dramatic, but you really shouldn't be apologizing because anyone who got offended by what you said is just being a crybaby imo. \n\nOn another note, I haven't really been to China but I have visited other Asian countries and it is a huge adjustment especially if you don't know anyone there. They really shouldn't even be considering unless they have a genuine interest in living in China, not just attending NYU. \n\nWhich makes me wonder... OP, what compelled you to want to apply to a program in China?",

Even if you really really prefer Lincoln Center and want to spend most of your time there, it's super easy getting there from Rose Hill",

Also you can always study abroad for a whole semester, if you're looking for an experience like that, and fordham has some amazing programs you should research.  NYU Shanghai sounds amazing, but unless you're planning on staying there after grad, it could be a lot harder for you.",

You just take the Ram Van down from RH to LC. If campus diversity is your concern, I assume that you can move off campus after freshman year as well.",

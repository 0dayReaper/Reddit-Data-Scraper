My main concern is that I already have double major + minor plans that don't involve religion, so I was wondering 1) how impactful a certificate is in the long run, 2) how it would impact my major/minor plans, and mainly 3) if there are any alumni / current members on this Reddit whom I can speak to and ask abt their experience? Thanks!",

It is a small cohort and an active center, and you really get to know your professors. Dr Lee is particularly amazing during your series of two successive seminars. The program is very interdisciplinary and Dr Lee will work with you to make it fit in your schedule. While I think people in the program know it looks good, I would say that no one who stays in the program does it for the long-term impact. As a general note, nothing in your undergrad program is impactful outside of the joy of learning and knowing unless you do something with it. Do CACS because you want to make a tight-knit group of friends, get to know professors, and learn how to closely examine the history, sociology, politics, and theology of American Catholicism.",

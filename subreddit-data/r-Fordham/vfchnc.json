Since its a three day program with activities it gives a good opportunity to develop some close friendships or at least get used to meeting people in a new place. Also it\u2019s very nice to get a head start in moving in. It\u2019s also connects you with organizations or volunteer programs if you are someone who is into social activism or want to know more about that in the area of New York. I think the program changes a bit every year so I am not sure what the activities will be like for you but I got to plant trees and that was fun and then we also had a excursion at the end where we went into groups and explored an area in Manhattan but Im not a rose hill student so mayyyy be diff",

It is kinda volun-tourism but some friends of mine are running it this year and working to make it less of that. It is great for learning about and gaining an appreciation for the Bronx (and showing you that peoples perceptions of it are based mainly in racism\u2026). You\u2019ll be doing orientation like stuff (icebreakers), volunteering, reflections, and a lot of people find their close friends from it. I wish they had it for upperclassmen bc I would have done it every year if I could :) \n\nFeel free to Dm me if you have any specific questions!!!",

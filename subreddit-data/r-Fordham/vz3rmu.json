I won\u2019t be in NY during orientation and was wondering if I\u2019ll be missing out on a lot? I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll miss making connections and that when I start going to class everyone will already know everyone else",

They\u2019ll get you an ID (the physical ones are better than the glitchy electronic one), give you some decent swag, and there was ok free food and an hour long open wine and beer at the end. I generally don\u2019t turn down free food or drink, but I probably won\u2019t pay extra to go to it again.",

Some other stuff I gave to my parents and they liked. Ya know, swag. Stuff you\u2019d never pay for but later think \u201cthat was a nice touch\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t remember the official name for that leather thing. The water bottles were decent quality. Considering what a bottle of water costs in the vending machines, more nalgene style bottles is helpful.",

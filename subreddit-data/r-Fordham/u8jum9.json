You get quizzes every week but they\u2019re online on blackboard and multiple choice. There\u2019s a midterm and final and one small argument paper but that\u2019s it. Participate once in a while and you\u2019re good! \nFor Theo 1000 I had Joseph strife and he\u2019s super nice. You basically have to read the readings he assigns and every week you have to complete a thesis and create a question ( these are one sentence each and not graded on the work itself just graded if you completed it) and once in a while you\u2019ll get a 3 page paper to do! Hope this helps :)",

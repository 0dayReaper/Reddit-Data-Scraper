(Pretty hopeful since supposedly they accept almost half of their waitlist applicants.) \n\nI have already submitted the response form and sent a letter to the admissions counselor for my local area (thoughts she hasn\u2019t replied yet and I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s received it, or if I sent it to the right person.)  \n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks.",

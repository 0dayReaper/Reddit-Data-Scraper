He used fill-in-the-blank \"templates\" for all our papers. It was ridiculous LOL.\n\nIf you're someone who enjoys writing and want to actually learn something for Engl1102, I would not take him.",

No such thing as a lenient or easy calc prof but these guys make sure to teach you and do all they can to guide you through it, and are very understanding",

            "comment": "They\u2019re fairly similar in regards to connecting technology with communication and media studies and there are some courses that apply to both majors. I think the biggest difference would be the flexibility that NMDD offers as there are concentrations that you can have that focus on the artistic aspect of technology or the more practical aspects that deal with programming and information management. You can take a look at the [NMDD requirements](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/new-media-digital-design/major/?_ga=2.175934242.1486112871.1645862826-1497266946.1629453426#requirementstext) and [DTEM requirements ](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/communication-media-studies/digital-technologies-emerging-media-major/?_ga=2.175934242.1486112871.1645862826-1497266946.1629453426#requirementstext) on the Fordham site.",

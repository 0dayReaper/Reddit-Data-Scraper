    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman at GSB RH and had a few questions about the CBBU course. \n\n\\- All of the classes (at least this year) are only meet once a week for three hours. Should I be worried about this?\n\n\\- Is there a textbook for this class? I can't seem to find one. \n\n\\- Are some professors better than others? I'm assuming because it is an introductory course the workload will be the same no matter the teacher. \n\nThanks guys. Go rams!",

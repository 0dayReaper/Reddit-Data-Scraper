I can't find anything about the process for incoming students, but it might be the same. \n\nAre you referring to a a change of colleges or just a change in where you're living? The latter may be easier to manage. Reach out to Dean Rebecca Stark-Gendrano rstarkgendrano@fordham.edu and see if it's possible. \n\nhttps://www.fordham.edu/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/student-resources/academic-resources/internal-transfer/",

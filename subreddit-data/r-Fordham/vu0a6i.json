Lastly, would the classes I take be fine, or would I have to take any other classes?  I'm not really sure at all what I should do in that regard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

Fordham has a very strong core curriculum that you will be required to take in year 1 and 2 before you focus heavily on your major. Their transfer application is very straightforward and they don\u2019t require a supplemental essay. Maintain good grades at Hunter and foster a decent relationship with a few of your professors (who you intend to get letters of rec from). Hunter should have a college advisor to help transferring students as well. You may have a better shot at Fordham by staying two semesters at Hunter \u2014 which would allow you to have a decent transcript to send over to Fordham (and get some of those core classes out of the way).",

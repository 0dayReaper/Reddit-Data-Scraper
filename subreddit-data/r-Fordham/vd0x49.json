The admin doesn't want students taking two EP classes in the same semester because they're usually more writing-intensive. I was able to take my EP2 and EP3 both during my sophomore year (not sure if it was in the same semester or not) but that usually doesn't happen, the class registration portal almost always blocks you from enrolling in two EPs in the same semester.",

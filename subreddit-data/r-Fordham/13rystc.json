            "comment": "Fordham has a stronger business school than Pace, and Pace has a 55% retention rate since most people transfer out/leave college altogether after their first year at Pace - and all of the business students at Pace act like Pace, a school with an 88% acceptance rate is cutthroat. I only know maybe about 3 or so students who use their BBA in Arts and Entertainment Management from Pace post graduation.",

If all of a sudden you feel inspired to do something great in marketing, you can be an all star at Fordham and 100% end up somewhere nice (have multiple friends in marketing at top tier firms from Fordham). \n\nPace absolutely not",

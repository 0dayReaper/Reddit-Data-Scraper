            "comment": "Wow, your situation is the exact opposite of mine. I live really close to Sarah Lawrence but got better aid at Fordham. I was already ED for Fordham though so I was locked in when I got admitted.\n\nYou got great aid from both which is great! I don't really know anything about Sarah Lawrence's pre-med/pre-dental track, but I think you have the right impression about it at Fordham. It's really, really hard. The only people I have met in my year who went pre-med have switched to another program, or are struggling a lot. There's certainly plenty of people who do succeed, but if you want to be that person you have to be extremely dedicated to your studies and be really familiar with the material being taught *before* a class starts (because, quite frankly, its very difficult to learn most of this stuff in one semester while taking other classes).  \n\n\nEither way, congrats on being admitted and on receiving good aid! Good luck wherever you end up.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. Trying to prep for orientation tomorrow (and future on-site classes) and looking for advice on parking. I've looked through some of the garages that Fordham says they can validate for, but reviews aren't the greatest, including things being stolen and not accepting the Fordham discount even with validation, etc. SO, thought I would ask if anyone has experience driving to this campus and parking somewhere they like. Thanks for any suggestions!",

While I could train it in on a day like today where I don't have work, I'd rather \"practice\" my parking routine for when I start teaching and have to race out at the last bell to make it to my two evening classes. Fortunately, I only have to drive in once a week :-) So, that's good.",

I parked at the Alfred car park on 62nd for orientation and it seemed great and easy and they just scanned my student ID which automatically gave me a $19 fee (for up to 10 hours). I wonder if that discount will change with the congestion thing...",

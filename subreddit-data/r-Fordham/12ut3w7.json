I was hoping it would discuss a wider range of religions more in depth.  \n\nOverall, the professors and student body don't seem to have overt (or any) ties to religion.  I agree with the above poster, as I too often forget I'm at a Jesuit school.",

I think the professors have some autonomy over what they teach and how they teach it, so it may depend on what professor you have.",

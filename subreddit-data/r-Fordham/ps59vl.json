    "postText": "how many people in class either frequently remove their masks or wear them below the nose? I have some courses where roughly 1/3 of the class regularly does this. And whenever I go to the fitness center (rose hill) it seems like 1/2 the gym isn't wearing them at all. And by some strange coincidence covid cases on campus have begun to rise. It's like, I'm not wearing the thing because I want to \u2013 they're uncomfortable, make it harder to meet people, etc. I'm not worried about getting covid or dying (I've already had it, and I'm vaccinated) but I would feel terrible if my negligence got someone else sick. It just makes me feel kind of alone, I guess, that so many people don't seem to care or even extend the same courtesy.",

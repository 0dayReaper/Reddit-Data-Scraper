If the reports are accurate and anecdotal evidence from my partner\u2019s hospital (she\u2019s a nurse) - that BA-5 reinfects people that had other variants within the past month- then it\u2019s going to be a long fall. Kinda like \u201cCovid endgame\u201d where everyone gets it a couple times until hopefully it down shifts to being more like a cold. \n\nBut yeah, RH is going to be impenetrable as ever.",

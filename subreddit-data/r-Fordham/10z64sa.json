The first floor is decent and the law school is beautiful, but as for the rest of the building, it is run down and in serious need of renovating. Also, it is extremely leftist and it is hard to find people with mixed views and definitely not for most people looking for an intellectual college experience.",

One semester in and I switched, now I'm in RH and I have no regrets. If you are considering Fordham, go to RH, the social scene is 20x better and people actually actively seek out new relationships. LC is weird, feels like a highschool and doesn't have the same recognition and funding as the RH campus. Not to mention, there are barely any clubs at LC compared to RH. In summary, go to RH, avoid LC at all costs.",

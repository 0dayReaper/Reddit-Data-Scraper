If labor day doesn't bring any spikes, that's  good news for going forward. Key is the continuous observation of RAM Pledge to keep it that way.",

Especially as building friendships and seeing some professors in person for 5-6 weeks is a great head start before going online if the pandemic does break out. Boston Univ and Northeastern are publishing and they are finding 0.05% positive and MA infection rate is slightly higher than NY and did not have the strict quarantine requirements as NY/Fordham. So will keep fingers crossed that it will go all the way to thanksgiving.\n\n**Spring 2020 Fee Reductions**\n\nCharges Reduced by 50%:\n\n* Room and Board (New York campuses)\n* Residence Hall Activity Fees\n* General &amp; Lab Fees\u00a0\n* Ensemble fees (MUSIC 1291, 1300, 1301, 1302, and 1303)\n\nOther Charges and Arrangements\u00a0\n\n* Parking - varies by plan\n* BASW/MSW Field Work - arrangements for completion will be sent by April 5\n* Miscellaneous Other \u00a0Fees - not refundable",

If you spend a month living on campus, they get to keep all of your room and board.\n\nSpring 2020 was different; it was an unprecedented time and the university gave refunds due to pushback and because of the uncertainty of the situation. Now, they have a legitimate policy to fall back on.\n\nEdit: clarity",

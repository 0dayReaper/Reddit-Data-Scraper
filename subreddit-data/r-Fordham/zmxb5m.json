I\u2019m a commuter at LC and I hate the lack of sports clubs, study spots, etc. It\u2019s gonna be a hassle and also much more expensive to live in Manhattan. Trust me you don\u2019t want to do this. Just ram van or subway into Manhattan on the weekends.",

The commute sucks and will be hard to meet people splitting time between each campus. Either transfer courses to LC or live at rose hill \n3. RH &gt; LC anyways",

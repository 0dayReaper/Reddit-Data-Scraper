            "comment": "Commuting is honestly not an issue. LC is really not the best environment to make friends but honestly, if you make yourself more available, you\u2019ll be able to make some easily. Walking up to people, introducing yourself, exchanging numbers with people in your classes, etc. But, to put it frankly, it\u2019s more of a rapid paced environment so it\u2019s definitely harder to make friends at LC. RH is the pinnacle of college experience though. You can always change campuses before the year starts, so just make your decision asap.",

            "comment": "Hi.\n\nFCLC definitely is not the place to commute to for 'the college experience'. While you can absolutely meet people and make friends, you might find yourself left out of friend groups and spontaneous outings, no matter how available you try to make yourself. It took me awhile to get used to that. I can't speak to the experience in commuter organizations, but you can easily get involved by joining student clubs that interest you.\n\nI agree with the other posters about blending LC and RH; it's pretty easy to get between the two campuses.",

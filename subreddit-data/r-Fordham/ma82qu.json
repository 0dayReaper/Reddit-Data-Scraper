    "postText": "Knowing that Fordom is a Jesuit university, I was wondering what the hook-up culture was like. I heard there is a strict visitors policy but is it impossible for anything to happen? Are most people saving themselves for marriage or is it like \"any other university\" when it comes to the hook-up and dating culture?",

I've been in the area for pretty much all my life and the college (at least in Rosehill) has a pretty good party scene with more people going out to the local bars or into the city to go to clubs. The visitor policy *is* strict, but this honestly isn't a bad thing at all. It was super annoying visiting friends at SUNY colleges and dealing with the noise, partying, music, and some girl getting her cheeks clapped into another dimension. I could not imagine having to deal with that every weekend. That being said, people often times find a way to sneak people into dorms and considering the fact that half the student body lives in off campus housing, it isn't hard to crash for the night with someone else.\n\nHopefully that answers your question. Partying and your odds of going home with someone should not play a role in you picking which college you attend, but you won't have to worry about Fordham's jesuit background stopping you from having fun.",

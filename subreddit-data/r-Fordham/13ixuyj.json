    "postText": "Hello, I am an incoming freshman majoring in psych. I have no idea where to start on which classes to take. Do I take all of the core requirements first for fresh/sophmore year and then take psych classes junior/senior? How do I know which classes fulfill electo 1-4? There is so much to do and I\u2019m getting stressed lmao\u2026",

            "comment": "There\u2019s something called degree works which will show which classes fufill each requirement. Some psych classes will probably overlap with the core. Most people take core classes and some of their major required at the same time- so like 4 core classes and 1 major. Or 3  core and 2 major. But again, there\u2019s overlap. Don\u2019t just take the core and than just take psych- what if you take an intro class and realize you want to major in something else but by than it\u2019s too late? If you have more questions feel free to Dm :)",

            "comment": "Hi, I\u2019m a grad student teacher in the psychology department. You should get an advisor when you declare your major. If you do, take their advice. If not, take Foundations of Psychology early, like freshman year (if not first semester). After you complete this, you can take several other courses, but not all of them. If you want to take classes like Sensation and Perception or Learning, this is the only class you technically need (although Stats will be helpful first).\n\nAs soon as possible after Foundations, take Statistics. Do not put this one off\u2026It\u2019s super important for understanding what happens in the rest of the psyc classes.\n\nAs soon as possible after that, take Research Methods. Research Methods is the other huge prereq of the program. That will open up the rest of classes.\n\nEven if you leave all other psyc classes until your junior/senior year, get those done ASAP so you aren\u2019t forced to get overrides to let you take them concurrently with classes that require those classes first.",

            "comment": "Had a bunch of friends Fordham took that major (this was a few years ago), they really liked it. You get exposure to a lot of what Fordham has to offer, taking courses at the business school, in the poli sci department, and in economics. You also get the full Fordham Core experience (which some people appreciate and others hate, not sure anyone actually 'likes' it). One thing that's important with that major is to make sure you're actively looking for internships and experience. Fordham has a good alumni network that can be helpful, but you've gotta do the legwork yourself. \n\nNot sure if all the professors will still be there but take Melissa Labonte if you get a chance, she's fantastic for international politics courses.",

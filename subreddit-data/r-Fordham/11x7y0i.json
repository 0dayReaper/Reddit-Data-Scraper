    "postText": "For anyone who has had success in receiving extra financial aid by appealing, how did the process go? Did they give you the amount you were hoping for? Less? More? Also, has anyone emailed asking for aid to be increased as you received a better financial aid package at another school you applied to? How did that work out?",

I called the financial aid office and asked for an appeal and they said they would send a appeal checklist to my email, i received it a day or two later. I added a merit package I received from another school and added a letter that explained my situation.",

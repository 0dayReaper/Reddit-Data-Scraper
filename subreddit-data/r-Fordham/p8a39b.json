Some classes the textbooks are mostly decorative, whereas if you need intense studying the physical books are helpful. I had an ECON class where I didn\u2019t pay attention all semester but then used the physical copy (that I got from Walsh) to do the take home midterm and it was really helpful. I would take it class by class, and only actually buy the textbook if you need to. Classes where you need to intensely study them / have homework out of physical is helpful, but if it\u2019s just another resource PDF is fine and easier",

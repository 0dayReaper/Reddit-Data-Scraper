    "postText": "Hello, thank you guys for reading my question. So I am a sophomore at a college, and I just got accepted to Fordham university. I have a 3.8 gpa at my current college. Last spring I did drop a class and get a W, but I\u2019m guessing it was fine because Fordham still accepted me, but I saw that a class I was taking at my current college, which is calc 2 is not needed for my major at Fordham university so I dropped the class at my college. I was also taking a calc 2 lab and for me to be able to drop calc 2 I also had to drop out of the lab class so now I have a total of 3 W on my transcript. I\u2019m sure I can get an A in my other three classes, for this semester and even thought I knew I could pass calc 2 with a good grade I dropped it since I saw I didn\u2019t need it for my major requirements at Lehman and now I\u2019m kinda regretting it. Do you think they will revoke my admission?",

Hopefully they don\u2019t revoke my admission because I worked so hard to get in, and I would really be depressed if they revoked my admission. So many people told me I wouldn\u2019t make it and I want to prove to myself that I can do it.",

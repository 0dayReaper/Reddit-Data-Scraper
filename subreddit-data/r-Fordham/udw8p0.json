It might even feel over the top, but as long as you're not trying to shove friendships down people's throats and just actively see if there are connections there, you're doing it right. God knows way too many people don't take that step far enough and their freshman year is abysmal because of it. It can even create a vicious cycle that I have seen even seniors continue to hurt from.",

It\u2019s not at all awkward or weird if during freshmen year, especially the first part, you are super friendly /acting in a way that would be considered desperate any other time in life. Like EVERY SUNGLE PERSON is frantically trying to find friends and super anxious about it and they will be so happy to have new friends. Also, then as you get to know people a bit and you have a bunch of people who you can choose from to get closer with, instead of only really knowing one or two people from orientation. Also, if you have a lot of casual friends or people you are friendly with you can be invited to cool parties and fun things that take bigger groups",

            "comment": "One more: be strategic about classes. If you are 100% sure what your major is, amazing! Then you should try to get really good at using the class scheduling system (basically takes trial and error) and use the plan feature to choose future classes. If you know your major now, and if you don\u2019t then when you do know your major later, your #1 goal should be to get as many classes as you can to count for two things- usually a core class and a major class. Like some core classes (basically Fordhams gen eds) can give you credit for both your major and for taking the core class that everyone is required to take. For example, my junior year for my Enviro Science major I was required to take like a social/policy environmental science class and for the core, I had to take my second theology class. I took a class called like \u201cReligion and Ecology through history\u201d or something and that satisfied both requirements. That way instead of taking a separate science class and religion class, I got them done at the same time. Not every class or requirement makes this work but if you can do it it gives you tonnnnnns more room in your schedule to take fun classes or graduate early or double major/minor or even just have like really chill semesters as an upperclassmen with very few classes which you could use to sleep in and enjoy NYC or you could also use to get a job or an internship. \n\nIf you DONT know your major or are kind of sure but not really, don\u2019t take any major classes. Spend your entire first semester (or two if possible) taking core classes (depending on your major but you usually need 2 theology, 2 philosophy, 2-3 history, 1 math, 2 English etc.) then you get these (sometimes) annoying but also easy classes out of the way and Junior and senior year can be spent like 100% on your major. It\u2019s so much better spending your later years focusing on what you love and it gives you an opportunity to get internships or do research or whatever!",

The people who had the most fun and the most friends at college (I went to LC) were the ones who did EVERYTHING. And not even expensive stuff. There are apps to get free tickets to like late night shows and stuff (1iota is one app) or you can wait overnight for SNL or you can get rush tickets or cheap tickets to Broadway or concerts. There are food and dance and culture festivals every weekend somewhere in the city. There are things to do on the rivers and ferry\u2019s to take and parks to visit and museums to visit and SOOOO much of it is free or insanely cheap for everyone or college students. Like seriously, it can be overwhelming but you have so many options and it can make your life so fun",

            "comment": "Listen. You will hear this in every freaking event and orientation and shit but like.. literally join five clubs. Hang out at all the club meetings for the first semester or two and then you can see which ones are helpful or fun or interesting or have amazing people and you can just drop the ones you don\u2019t like. It\u2019s SO CLICHE but literally so fun bc clubs get free food and like access to stuff not everyone else does and you get to have an amazing network of cool people. Plus, if you\u2019re interested and a responsible person most of the clubs (especially more moderate sixes ones) will probably have an opportunity for you to join their officers/eboard by sophomore or Junior year. And that\u2019s super fun and looks good on a resume! Another option, if at Rose Hill, is to do like intramural sports or something! \n\nEdit to say: doing some sort of service/volunteering with fordham is amazing. Like I\u2019m not religious but they do some cool outreach. The Global Outreach club/projects are cool and some of them allow you to travel internationally. That can be a little pricey but they also have options within NYC or within the country. \n\nOther than volunteering, getting a job on campus (if you need the $$) is kind of nice bc you get to know employees and other student coworkers.",

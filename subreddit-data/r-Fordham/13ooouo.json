    "postText": "Hi, I was just wondering if to get Dean\u2019s list i have to have a 3.6 for both the spring and fall semester each, or just a 3.6 combined for both semesters. My first sem gpa was 3.534 and my second sem gpa was 3.686. my combined gpa is 3.615. Does this mean I make dean\u2019s list or no?",

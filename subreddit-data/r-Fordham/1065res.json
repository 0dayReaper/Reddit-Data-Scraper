    "postText": "Just graduated Gabelli with BS in business admin and I need help finding a job. Career center hasn\u2019t been very helpful neither has LinkedIn. Every job I apply for I get denied, paid and unpaid entry level jobs and internships. I redid my resume completely twice and still no help. The jobs I have landed turned out to be pyramid scheme scams. I also can\u2019t afford to live in NY at all big time and can\u2019t afford grad school. Any career advice?",

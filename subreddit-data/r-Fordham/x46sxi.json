    "postText": "I'll put the ask up front and then elaborate below. Please read and consider signing this [student letter of solidarity](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScyzzHVp_qgYOnS8OCKlQqabuFgM6EWLlPdyaEOZudeNnkpmg/viewform) with Fordham Faculty United, the union of contingent faculty at Fordham.\n\nThe union represents part time faculty and full time faculty who aren't tenured or on the tenure track. We get paid significantly less per class than our tenured and tenure-track colleagues, and part time faculty don't make anywhere close to a living wage for New York. Nor are we eligible for health insurance.\n\nWe are currently bargaining for a new contract and are asking Fordham for 8% raises per year for part time faculty for the next 3 years. This basically just keeps up with inflation -- so we would not be gaining any real purchasing power. Fordham is offering only 3%, effectively offering us a pay CUT. \n\nOur other demands are health insurance eligibility for part timers who don't get insurance elsewhere and pay parity (fairness) across schools. For instance, teachers at the Graduate School of Social Services at Lincoln Center only make about $4600 per course, while entry level teachers in the School of Arts and Sciences make $7,000 per course. We feel this is plainly unfair, since we do the same work -- just in different subject areas.\n\nThe full timers in our union have it a little better (higher pay per course than part timers, plus health insurance), but they are still paid far less than our tenured and tenure-track colleagues. There are so few tenure-track jobs anymore that lots of highly qualified people don't get then -- it's not a matter of folks not being good enough at their jobs. (This is also why 70% of college courses are taught by part timers nationwide-- there just aren't a lot of full time jobs anymore, period.) \n\nWe simply want to be paid a wage that does the bare minimum of keeping up with inflation, have health benefits, and have all of our colleagues paid equally for equal work. The university wouldn't even lose money by paying us more, because they've already budgeted $5 million for unexpected costs this year -- and our demands don't equal anywhere near that much.\n\nSigning our letter helps us put pressure on Fordham by letting them know that y'all support us and are paying attention to how they treat us. When we aren't paid well, we have to get second (or third, or fourth) jobs to pay our bills, which means we have less time and energy to devote to y'all.",

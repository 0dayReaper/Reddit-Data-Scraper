    "postText": "Trying to make a last minute decision rn.\n\nI'm waitlisted from Cornell, and I plan to transfer to Cornell whether I go Fordham or Baruch.\n\nHowever, since I didn't get the transfer option, I still want a decent school for undergrad in case I don't make it later on.\n\nI've been accepted into Northeastern, Babson, Bing (not considering), Fordham, Baruch, and a few CUNYs.  Also have a full-ride from LIU, but I'm not really considering it.\n\nJust wanted to ask which school is better from a Fordham POV.  I want to major in finance and will  go Gabelli/Zicklin.",

I actually transferred out of Fordham after freshman year, but that\u2019s because I wanted to study engineering. \n\nIf you can afford Fordham, then Gabelli is the clear choice. It is a very reputable business school and you might decide that\u2019s the best place for you.\n\nAdditionally, Baruch won\u2019t let you designate your major until after your sophomore year. I would not want to waste my time taking 2 years of electives and then condense my major classes into two+ years. Fordham will start you off with some intro business courses freshman year and by sophomore year you will be embarking on major finance classes.  \n\nI don\u2019t think you should go into a school with the intention of transferring without giving the first school a chance. Fordham is a great business school and honestly Cornell isn\u2019t that much of a step up. Fordham business students are competing for the same jobs. And anyone who tells you otherwise is in denial and too insecure to admit it.\n\nPrivate message me if you would like to discuss.",

Yes, it's 5k less per year, but the debt for Baruch graduates is MUCH MUCH lower, and that is extremely important to take into consideration if you plan to pay for your education through student loans.   \n\n\nP.S. I got accepted to Fordham and Baruch as a transfer student for this coming fall semester, so I was also in the same boat as you with trying to decide between the two.",

Have you considered a community college? You can save your money, take some SAT prep classes, and get into a great school. \nOnly Cornell and Penn offer undergrad Business in the Ivies. \nBoth Virginia and Notre Dame should be considered if you transfer, their undergrad B programs are among the best. \nAs you likely know Transferring in is less complicated and quicker that traditional admission, good luck!",

There's no greek life but that doesn't mean that nobody socializes. There's house parties and pregames often, just depends on who you know. I personally hate the Fordham bars with a passion and never find myself going out to them. I'd rather spend the $2.75 to get into the city and go out to bars there because it's a much better experience. Fordham bars cost an arm and a leg, at least a $10 for every bar, drinks are ridiculously overpriced, the music is never good, and all the Fordham kids are pushy and shove-y. Everyone who i've gone out with likes to bounce from bar to bar which seems to be a common trend, because no bar is fun enough to stay for more than 30 mins but that means you could easily spend $30-60 a NIGHT on drinks/covers. Not worth it in my experience. The alumni connections are only good if you're in Gabelli because that's where the school emphasizes creating and maintaining those relationships. The one good thing about it is the location because there are so many opportunities in the city.",

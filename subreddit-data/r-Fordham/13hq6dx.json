            "comment": "Technically, Final grades are due a certain number of days after the exam period. However, there are tons of exceptions for tons of reasons. Many exams, like any that include essays, generally can\u2019t be graded in the rather short time period. There\u2019s often at least one student who is sick and needs a later exam date, so that will delay things. \n\nThe school really only pushes for immediate grades on students who are graduating. For anyone who isn\u2019t graduating this semester, the grades could come out in the few days after your exam or they could get an extension. \n\nIn complete honesty, unless you are graduating, your best bet is to check every few days and not obsess about it. Just make sure to check like twice a week or so, because if you need to appeal you only get a ten-day window to appeal a grade that does not reflect your mastery of the material.",

Releasing grades all together decreases student stress so that everyone isn\u2019t wondering \u201chow come they got their grade and I haven\u2019t gotten mine?!?\u201d But they are entered separately regardless of when they are released. \n\nSo the optimal situation for most professors is finishing all grades with the seniors\u2019 grades and repeating them all in a reasonable timeframe. Less preferred is entering each student one at a time and releasing just that student.",

Here\u2019s the undergrad policy. https://www.fordham.edu/info/24145/undergraduate_faculty_handbook/6607/procedure_for_appealing_a_course_grade. If you need a different school, just let me know which and I\u2019ll look into it.\n\nThis is for if you believe your final grade is inaccurate to the work you actually completed in class. It can be a typo, the professor grading unfairly, or other reasons, but it is based on the work you actually did while in class. It is not a way to prove that you know the material through submitting any additional work to be evaluated separately. That would encourage people to not take classes seriously if they believe they are already good at the material (even when they aren\u2019t but believe they are).\n\nYou can also appeal based on things like the professor testing on things that aren\u2019t covered in class, but those are pretty difficult and need to be pretty egregious.",

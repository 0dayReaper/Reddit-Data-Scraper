    "postText": "hey guys! So I\u2019m thinking of double majoring or doing a major with a double minor, but I\u2019ve heard that double majoring can cost more money? It\u2019s kinda confusing to me, like would I have to pay more direct tuition or do the people saying this just mean that you\u2019ll have to pay more bc of the cost of course materials like textbooks? sorry if this is a dumb question but I can\u2019t seem to find the question online anywhere \ud83d\ude05 is it the same for double minor? For context I\u2019d like to major in environmental studies with a double minor in psychology and music. If anyone studying either of these can also lmk how the program is that would be great hehe\n\nOH ALSO I heard that freshmen can\u2019t make their schedules until they meet with an advisor, is that true? If so, how would I meet with an advisor as a student who doesn\u2019t go to Fordham yet or know any advisors?\n\nthanks so much!",

This is because the core curriculum is very demanding and will take up many of your classes. Honestly if you got into a college with a less demanding curriculum, like one with distributional requirements or an open curriculum, look into that one more. you should consider it given your ambitious desires will be much more difficult at Fordham \n\n\nEdit: and your advisor will reach out to you over the summer.",

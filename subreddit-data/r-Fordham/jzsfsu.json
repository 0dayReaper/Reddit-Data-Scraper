I\u2019m a hard working student, never miss an assignment and have no problem putting my head down and working for \u22486 hours straight, but I feel like I\u2019m drowning in work rn. Idk if it\u2019s because I\u2019m home now or the transition to winter or what but I feel no energy or motivation anymore. Tell me this isn\u2019t just me.",

And then you have my dickhead spanish teacher who scheduled a mandatory (virtual) in-class writing assignment the day before we\u2019re supposed to leave our dorms by 12 PM before getting fined, completely trashing my travel plans.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t evident by the long-ass post, yes.

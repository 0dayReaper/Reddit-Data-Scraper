I really want to do student broadcasting in college, but it seems like students don\u2019t actually get a DJ slot and they just work for departments within the station. Can anyone enlighten me as to how it works?",

The news division by far gets the most freedom\u2014 students are the ones making the on-air newscasts, doing all the research and writing, but the real thing is you get to use WFUV as a platform for your own projects\u2014 podcasts, audio-documentaries, etc. There\u2019s also a student-run radio show about Irish music if that\u2019s your thing, and the sports people get a lot of agency/air-time too! Great opportunity throughout college and depending on what you\u2019re doing, it might even pay! :)",

I don\u2019t really enjoy the writing part of it but I do love just DJ\u2019ing and playing music and talking. Is WFUV the right fit for me or is it just a lot of writing newscasts? The irish music show does seem fun though.",

After spending my first year in McMahon though, I realized it really was a blessing in disguise. \n\nTalking to my friends who lived in McKeon, most shared that they wished they had been placed in McMahon. There's a lot more space, better lounges, nicer/ more private bathrooms, an opportunity to cook (which if you can cook, was honestly cheaper than being on the meal plan for me!). Frankly, it was a lot easier to make friends on the floor too. \n\nI'm not sure if there's a high chance that you can switch (then again, my freshman class was huge so I may have had trouble simply because they had no other spaces open), but if you're unsuccessful, you can still make the most of McMahon. Good luck!",

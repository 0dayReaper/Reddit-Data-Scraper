But that was before COVID and the test score policies changed. I think you should be ok to keep it, but consider the rest of your application and try to figure out if it makes you a more well rounded candidate.",

So on that scale I was a 4.1. on a normal scale I'd be something like a 3.7 I'm pretty sure. \nI lettered in track one year. Volunteered in my church and boy scout troop. And I was a leader in my extracurriculars like band etc. So even though I didn't do well on the tests, I had other stuff on my apps to cushion the blow.",

    "postText": "Hello, I committed to Fordham RH with a major in political science! I\u2019m starting in the fall and my end goal is to attend a good law school. However I\u2019m really worried that I won\u2019t be able to maintain a high gpa (3.7 or 3.8) because of all the talk about Fordhams grade deflation. \n\nI\u2019m willing to put in the work for the gpa, but is it really as hard as people say? Thank you and any replies are appreciated!!",

Becomes more of a problem when you\u2019re a junior/senior taking upper level major requirements and running into more tenured professors, who love having their course be known as the \u201chard class\u201d.",

            "comment": "Grad student and instructor here: I honestly wonder if this is true grade deflation. Grade deflation means purposely changing the curve of the class so that the average is less than a C. However, incoming undergrad GPAs at Fordham average an A-. This means that in order to avoid grade *inflation* (changing the curve of the class so that the average is higher than a C), we need to have much higher expectations of every student than they ever faced in high school.\n\nIn my department, we are strongly discouraged from either grade inflation or grade deflation. We are expected to have a class average of a C. This means a few people will get As, most will get Bs and Cs, and only a few will fail. \n\nBut yes, students who had an A- average coming in from high school can and do fail. High school is easier than college. \n\nGrade deflation isn\u2019t when someone didn\u2019t continue to see the same performance they did in high school. Don\u2019t expect that a normal grade will be the same grade you got in high school for the same amount of work. Grade deflation is when the class average is intentionally lower than a C.\n\nThat said, there are a very small number of \u201cweed-out\u201d classes that do this. I don\u2019t know if there are any in poli-sci. As far as I know, there are none in my department either. I think that organic chemistry is one in biology? These are intentionally difficult classes because they feed into extremely difficult programs. The point is to get people to change their major before waiting four years and being unable to graduate anyway because they couldn\u2019t handle the classes or final project.\n\nIf you want to maintain the same grade that you did in high school, expect to work much higher for that same grade. Remember, a 3.7 incoming GPA is only just higher than average here, and average performance warrants a C or a B if you are lucky. Only exceptional performance warrants an A.\n\nBut there is better news: a C isn\u2019t a bad grade! In high school it\u2019s a bad grade *because* you need good grades to get into college. For most jobs, they won\u2019t care what your college GPA is. They only care that you graduated. So if you get a C, it\u2019s fine! You graduate with a C! C is average. Average performance earns diplomas. That\u2019s all you need. So reframe the whole \u201cgood grade\u201d thing in your head. Don\u2019t count every point. Just make sure you\u2019re not failing outright. That\u2019s honestly all that matters.",

That\u2019s what I think people are usually referring to when they say its more difficult to get higher grades at Fordham.\n\nFordham also does not offer A+\u2019s like many other schools do, even if you score 98%+. When you apply to law school you will get your LSAC GPA generated for you based on your transcript. A is 4.0 and A+ gives you like 4.1 or 4.2 or something to boost your LSAC GPA. So you also lose out on that advantage when applying to law school.\n\nThis being said, I am not a Poli Sci major, maybe they have easier grading than other majors. But most likely its the same.",

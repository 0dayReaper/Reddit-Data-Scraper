    "postText": "I'm an admitted FCRH poli-sci major interested in Manresa. I'd like to make sure I roughly understand how the program's unique classes intersect with the core curriculum.\n\nBased on information available on Fordham's website, I am guessing the following could be considered a reasonable first-year courseload?\n\n1. Foreign Language\n2. Composition\n3. Mathematics and Democracy (Manresa course that fulfills mathematical reasoning and EP req)\n4. Philosophy 1000\n5. Faith and Critical Reasoning\n\nIs that correct? Are there any courses I need to add on or take off? Is there a minimum or a cap?\n\nAlso, **how many courses do freshmen usually take? Are any of them ever related to their major?** **Or all liberal-arts-core related?**\n\nThanks for the help!",

I was in Manresa and the class I took was a pluralism and social second. Also not to take phil and theo in the same semester (as a phil major and religious studies minor)",

Is there a public PDF or some guide that explains the duration of each Fordham course?\n\nI believe Mathematics and Democracy is a course available to all Manresa students interested in it. Do Manresa students choose just one course from the Manresa-specific curriculum? And are they all taught in Loyola Hall? I've searched all over for this seemingly basic info but can't find anything lol. If anyone can point me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it.",

I would transfer out of Manresa, not worth it unless you\u2019re an asshole then it\u2019s the place for you!",

Freshman usually start out with five as far as I'm aware. You can totally choose to take major-related courses as a freshman. Pretty sure minimum courseload is four to be considered full time?",

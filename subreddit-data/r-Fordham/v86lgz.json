If your thinking long term then I wouldn\u2019t go 100K in debt but that\u2019s me personally. Fordham is a great school and I\u2019d only choose that option if you are considering the second.",

Our finance program is very good and our office of professional development for finance majors is top tier. Placement at big banks is quite high.\n\nSource: am an incoming bulge bracket investment banking analyst who majored in finance from Fordham",

            "comment": "100k is really pushing it. I'd say a finance degree @fordham is worth at most $50k in debt, and that's assuming you're gung ho about banking/other high paying junior positions like consulting, accounting, etc\n\nFrom a simple financial/economic analysis standpoint, you could go to a college like Baruch and end up at the same firm, but with less than half the debt.\n\nOur finance program is about as good as YOU make it. Those that apply themselves and really build a resume almost always end up at name-brand firms. But, you can say the same exact thing for students at Baruch. \n\nSources: graduated Fordham incoming banking analyst @BB as well + have interned alongside CUNY students at PE/Banks",

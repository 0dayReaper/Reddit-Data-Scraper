You can take classes at either campus so your class can have LC and RH people on it. \n\nFor friends and parties, it's possible but it's obviously harder than if you were on the same campus, especially if you don't have the same classes next semester. I haven't heard of many parties at LC, and the ones I have heard of are more secretive, only for people's friends and other residents. Parties at RH are late at night, like 11PM-3AM, then taking the ram van back to LC that late would be whack",

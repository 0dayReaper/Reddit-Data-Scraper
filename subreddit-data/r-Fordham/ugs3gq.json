    "postText": "hey guys. i\u2019ve committed to fordham lc as a psychology major on a pre-health track, and honestly, i\u2019m kinda nervous abt my decision after reading all the threads abt fordham\u2019s pre-health curriculum. although the more i look into it, the more i realize that those who hate on the school\u2019s pre-health \u201cprogram,\u201d if you will, have never even gone to the school. for some more context, i plan on eventually applying to PA programs and most likely pick up a minor to be a more competitive candidate. can someone who is actually attending fordham on a pre-health track please give some insight? thank you sm.",

The \u201cpre-health\u201d track is just a set of required courses that is necessary for med school.

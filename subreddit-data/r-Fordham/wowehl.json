            "comment": "i\u2019d argue that there\u2019s actually equal if not more jobs/internships in research at the university. for example, each team in the psychology department has like 5 student research assistants and theres so many professor and grad student projects going on all the time. it\u2019s a different process of getting the job though.\n\nto get a lab/stem related job you need to apply through a professor that is conducting research or an application that the department has (psychology department is the only one I know that has a singular application to be a research assistant). \n\nsome of the lab positions are paid but most of them are not. if money is a huge factor then you can apply for a research grant for the research you\u2019re assisting in. it doesn\u2019t have to be original or solo research to get the grant and if you apply and fill out the application you can have the research internship through a professor but get paid by the university to do the research.\n\nif that makes sense? if you have any questions feel free to ask.",

            "comment": "In general the iPad seems to really piss people off when you try to do certain things. Some apps are not made to be compatible with an iPad. Yes drawing is great of course, but you\u2019re not able to do a spreadsheet in a timely manner. I would say this: you know what you\u2019re getting with the MacBook it\u2019s limited in drawing areas etc however it excels at what it\u2019s good at. The iPad throws curveballs at you and forces you to take workarounds constantly when something isn\u2019t working the way it should because you\u2019re on an iPad and not a mac. \n\nThis is from a ceo who has a 2 MacBooks and two iPads. One for work and home. The iPad is great for reading, writing down notes, watching shows. However if your reliant solely on the iPad it can have minor quirks that can really frustrate you and complexly mess up your rhythm. \n\n\nIf you can do both that\u2019s best of both worlds. \nIf you can do 1 do the Mac.",

            "comment": "100% Macbook. You\u2019ll just definitely use a laptop more to write lab reports, essays, and other documents  for not only your psychology classes but also your other extracurriculars and core curriculum classes (where essay writing is a huge component). Beyond that, Psychology students use SPSS and other online lab softwares which you can\u2019t use on an ipad but can on a mac, or you can you panopto (a microsoft emulator for the macbook) to also use SPSS and other apps. \n\nAdditionally a lot of professors will still host some classes online now if for example they\u2019re sick or if you are sick and want to tune in online. Doing so is easier on a computer.\n\nOtherwise get a mac for watching Netflix or Youtube when you\u2019re chilling in your dorm and it can be used to text, play games, or shop in class too since the screen is hidden from the professor.",

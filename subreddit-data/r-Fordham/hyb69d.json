Could someone tell me a little bit about the first week, beyond the PG version orientation leaders try to convince you of? What are some good ways to make friends and have a fun experience? Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hi there! I\u2019m a rising sophomore. The first week at Fordham is honestly a blur \u2014 you\u2019re gonna be busy all day with orientation and meeting new people and busy all night with parties and meeting more new people. I don\u2019t know how that will change with COVID (as far as bars being open and such), but I\u2019d recommend a few things (1-4 are standard advice, 5-10 are more practical):\n\n1) Mute conversations you have with friends/family at home (except for maybe mom or dad, just in case they need to contact you about something you forgot/something they need from you/etc). Really immerse yourself with the people around you. Talk to the kids in your orientation group and meet the kids on your floor and in your building. If you\u2019re busy worried about what\u2019s going on at home or with your high school friends, you\u2019re not going to have a very good time. You can catch up with friends and family when the week is over, but for the time being, really get to know the people in your class. \n2) Remember that everyone is in the same boat as you. Everyone is also super nervous to be meeting new people and worried about if they\u2019re gonna survive. It\u2019s really nice when people take the initiative to start a conversation with you, but you should also do that for other people. I remember one of the first experiences I had in the dining hall \u2014 it was totally packed with hungry freshmen, and there were only a few spots around. I asked a girl who I didn\u2019t know at all if I could sit and eat with her, and next thing I knew, we were connecting over all sorts of things. She\u2019s now a great friend of mine, and if I hadn\u2019t just sucked up my anxiety for a second and risked looking weird for a bit, I wouldn\u2019t have met such an amazing person.\n3) Get contact info!! Seriously!! Whether it\u2019s Instagram, snapchat, or just a good ole phone number, getting people\u2019s contact info is crucial. Even if you don\u2019t use it or you don\u2019t end up being friends with that person, you have no idea who may wind up living on the floor above you, or in the same class as you. That being said...\n4) Make an extra effort to be nice!! Tension and anxiety can run high during this time, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed. Just try to be kind, because the more people you get to like you, the easier life will become, especially considering at least one of the kids you meet will be in one of your classes.\n5) In my opinion, the best places to get alcohol are churry\u2019s and ram\u2019s deli. Neither of them card. Churry\u2019s is a true liquor store with an absolutely wonderful lady who will help you find what you\u2019re looking for. Ram\u2019s Deli has beer, spiked seltzer, etc, and you can also get one of their awesome sandwiches while you\u2019re there (and their onion rings and mozz sticks are really really good).\n6) Don\u2019t black out your first week. Some people feel like they have to because classes haven\u2019t started and this is like totally unadulterated freedom, but this experience drinking is gonna be how people remember you. If you black, you\u2019re probably less likely to get invited out later in the year because you\u2019re seen as a liability. Drink responsibly, and save blacking out for Halloweekend or right before Thanksgiving.\n7) Share your location with your roommate. You are in a new location after all. Being in an unfamiliar area is scary, especially when it\u2019s dark out. I\u2019ve found the Bronx to be very safe, however, for the sake of making sure both you and your roommate make it back to the room if you get separated is a good idea. \n8) Pick a pair of shoes to wear out and stick with them for the year. The biggest rookie mistake is picking Gucci sneakers for a night out, just to get puke or beer all over them. I use my old Adidas Superstars.\n9) Don\u2019t be afraid to ask upperclassmen questions, myself included (feel free to private message me). For the most part, we\u2019re pretty nice people and we understand the situation you\u2019re in. It\u2019s better to ask an upperclassman where to buy weed as opposed to seeking it out on your own and ending up with subpar results.\n10) You really don\u2019t have to go to the events the school sets up for you guys. I went to one, and it honestly wasn\u2019t anything special. I wish I had gone out or gotten Pugsley\u2019s instead of doing that. Everyone encourages you to go, but you really don\u2019t have to.",

The first week was one of the hardest weeks of my life since I had never been away from home like that. Since I\u2019m also quite introverted, making fast friends the first week seemed pointless to me, as I like my friendships to build over time. I definitely just took my time slowly and explored campus and the city on my own for a bit. I still attended events with my roommates (whom I did become friends with) and had a lot of fun! There\u2019s no one \u201cright\u201d way to do your first week, and remember that everyone is feeling as weird and alone as you are!",

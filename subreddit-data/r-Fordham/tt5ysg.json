The only reason you should take on that level of debt is if your career path **guarantees** that you can pay it off. This might be the case if you become a PA \u2013 they make pretty good salaries. But you would need to be completely certain that by the time you graduate you would still want to be a PA, that you can get a job as one, etc. I'm sure you know more about that than I do. Just consider all these factors carefully.",

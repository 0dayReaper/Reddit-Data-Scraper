    "postText": "Hi! I applied for the MSMI program at Gabelli and the website says admission interviews are a requirement. I\u2019m expected to get my results in about 3 weeks and have yet to receive an invitation to interview. Would anyone know what this means?\n\nI think I have a strong application (work experience, 4.0 GPA, 2 recommendations) but I\u2019m worried that not being selected to interview is an indication that I might not get accepted\u2026\n\nAny tips or advice?",

    "postText": "So a video emerged where a lot (more than 25) orientation leaders were dancing to the Cupid shuffle on Eddies. Many reported that not everyone was wearing a mask, a lot of OL\u2019s have come forward and admitted that there were a lot of off campus parties. At this point I don\u2019t really know who to believe, neither of which have concrete evidence. Anyway, how\u2019s orientation going to work this year?

Thing about the Cupid shuffle video is that the whole thing was an official mandatory event for the OL\u2019s, and from what I\u2019ve heard people not wearing masks wasn\u2019t really a problem but I can\u2019t personally confirm. Wouldn\u2019t blame the OL\u2019s so much as fordham for scheduling a mandatory dance on eddies. Off campus parties are definitely a thing though and that\u2019s way more important to worry about since most are probably inside and there\u2019s no one to enforce social distancing/masks. Based on what\u2019s been going on with other schools I give it like 2 weeks before we get shut down",

    "postText": "I have to stay in New York for my job but my dorm it's closed for winter break. When I asked reslife how I could stay on campus they said I would have to find a host in an open building. It seems like Campbell, Salice, and Conley Halls and Belmont Community Housing are the options at Rose Hill. I'm not sure how hosting would work but if anyone could help or host that would be great. Also my job is very close to Lincoln Center so if there's any housing there that would be great too.",

How would you compare it to other schools in the city?  \n\\- Is there grade deflation?  \n\\- Was it an enjoyable experience?  \n\\- What classes do you take your freshman year?  \n\\- Best professors in the department?  \n\\- How does fordham help you with careers/internships for CS?",

            "comment": "1) It's solid overall imo. I haven't attended other CS programs in the city, but I would probably guess that the schools that are ranked above Fordham have better CS programs (Columbia, NYU, etc), and the schools that emphasize STEM more have better programs (Stony Brook, Hunter???). Fordham is known for their business school and liberal arts in undergrad, not really their STEM majors. If your goal is to just graduate with a CS degree then get a job in the field then you'd definitely be able to do that with a Fordham CS degree. But if you want to like be an expert in your field and know the ins-and-outs of CS at the end of your degree, I probably wouldn't recommend Fordham CS.\n2) I think there's probably more grade inflation than deflation in the CS department. I don't think the major is as intense or difficult as in other schools. It also helps that in my experience, the professors literally don't want to fail you and want to see you do well. As long as you show up (sometimes you don't even have to show up), do your work, and like participate during classes, a lot of professors might not give you lower than a B. I've like not done well on countless midterms and finished with like B+/A- in the class just cuz the professor knew I was trying. \n3) I've enjoyed it so far. There are a lot of research opportunities if you're interested in that. The CS club has a lot of career building stuff to help you do well and get a job. The professors are all really nice. The entire environment between students is very collaborative rather than cutthroat and competitive like at other schools. If you miss a day and need someone's notes, or don't understand something, usually there's someone in the class who would be willing to help you. Overall I'd probably give it an 8/10 on like enjoyment so far. Some of the classes are kinda boring, but the professors are all still really nice so it's hard to be mad at them. \n4) You'd probably take CS I, CS II, Calc I if you don't have credit for that yet, Discrete Structures I and II, and maybe another requirement if you have the time. \n5) Just check RMP. My favorite professor ever at Fordham was Zigeng Liu in the CS department tho. You NEED to take her. She's awesome and such a good teacher. \n6) You have to be proactive in order to get internships and jobs out of Fordham CS, but they do have resources to help you if you seek them out. The career center would help you with your resume. The CS club sends out emails about research opportunities, projects, and like hack-a-thons to help build your resume. Some people have recently started a leetcode club to help you with coding interviews. And there are talks of starting a competitive programming club. As for actually applying for jobs, if you've built up your resume enough then you should probably be fine, but you will probably have to spend a good amount of energy and time applying to a lot of different positions before you can actually land one. I dunno if things are different at other schools, but generally that's what I've heard from other people at other schools as well. \n\nOverall, if you want a CS job, and are willing to put in the work, and want to be in the city then Fordham CS is not a bad decision. If you're like really passionate about CS and want to be like a top person in the field then I might recommend going somewhere else. I read this one time and I definitely feel like it's true for Fordham CS so I'd recommend you read it as well if you want some perspective: https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-case-a-bad-CS-degree-give-you-more-benefits-than-a-good-CS-degree/answer/Barry-Rountree?ch=15&amp;oid=26395351&amp;share=8fdd48b3&amp;srid=hrOFzZ&amp;target_type=answer",

            "comment": "Fordham's CS program is terrible (at least, the teachers and classes at Rose Hill, the career fairs and job search actually might be helpful - I didn't pursue them because I knew I didn't want to do CS professionally). CS1 and CS2 classes don't even cover the majority of what's offered at top CS schools, so you're way behind many programs. You also learn to code in C ++ which is an irrelevant language for most big name jobs out there. If you're interested in school/work in NYC, you will certainly graduate from Fordham with a CS degree, but you'll have to teach yourself a lot to stay competitive irl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for grade inflation, it's an extremely easy major - graded a lot like other humanities, with a lot of free As with completion. I did not enjoy my experience at all (ended up switching to a CS minor just to get something for my trouble), but if you read all this and still want to do CS, I recommend Kounavelis, Flatley, and Al Hayajneh for professors.",

Freshman year you\u2019ll take mostly core classes. And also cs1. Fordham has career fairs. But that\u2019s all they do to hook you up with an internship. You\u2019ll have to apply yourself etc",

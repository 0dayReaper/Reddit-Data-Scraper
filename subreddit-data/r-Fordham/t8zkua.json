    "postText": "I am considering transferring to Fordham as a biology major looking to become a PA.  I've been hesitant because of people saying how incredibly hard STEM is here and just that mostly fordham seems to be known for business and more humanities majors.  I would be going to RH and hope to get the vibe of living by the city.  I also heard it is hard to meet people and make connections and that people can be clicky.  Is it worth the transfer?",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm currently a student at Fordham and have been appalled by how I have seen multiple bias incidents handled.  Public safety and the admin are not on the side of their POC students. Please share your story if you have experienced a bias incident and been ignored or mistreated by the admin/public safety.  Or, any ideas to get the university to listen. \n\nStudents experiencing bias incidents should not have to worry about being profiled again by public safety. They should not have to live in halls where people get away with using slurs against them. If Fordham so desperately wants to keep the diversity they keep flaunting, they might want to start protecting the groups that make them diverse.",

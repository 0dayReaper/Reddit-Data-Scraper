    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm an accelerated transfer applicant but I'm having quite a bit of trouble getting the entirety of the application done.\n\nSo basically, I'm trying to apply using the accelerated transfer application. I got in back when i was in high school back in spring of 2021 for the fall 2022 semester, but due to some personal stuff I couldnt go. I tried again in the fall 2021 semester for the spring of 2022, using the accelerated transfer contract, but i dropped a class and went down to part time, so that disqualified me. Finally, I'm here trying again, for the fall 2022 semester. I completed the accelerated transfer contract on May 24, 2022. However, my applicant portal never updated, and I only could see the last two applicant portals from the previous attempts, including the withdrawal form from the last attempt. I called the admissions office a few times, and they told me to email who I could, which I did, but never received any response. So I basically said screw it, I got the contract in before June 1st, I'm just going to try anyways. My portal never updated, but on the phone with admissions they said that I should just try anyways. \n\nI've been trying to get my documents sent for quite some time now, and my school is simply not cooperating. I've emailed the registrars office AND my personal advisor, and I have not had any kind of luck having them send the documents that I need. I got one email back \\~3 days ago, and through that I was finally able to send my official College Transcript, and it should take a few days for that to be delivered to the University, so I guess thats good(?). However, I need the other two documents sent, and they won't help. I've literally attached the two documents that have to be sent, all they have to do is send it and they wont. I called my registrars office today, and I asked about the transfer college report, and the person on the phone basically called it useless because \"all of that info is on my transcript anyway\". I told them it needed to be completed regardless(in a more polite way, ofc), and I overall got the impression that they simply did not want to. I understand that its summer and the end of the semester and whatnot, but I've been trying for WEEKS at this point. I've sent a few emails to who I was told to email when I was on the phone with admissions, and at this point I don't really know what I can do. \n\nIs there anything I can do? Its past the deadline, but I know that it says that late applications will be considered on a \"case by case basis\" and I know some offices just accept late applications, but I really don't know what to do. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated. Thank again.",

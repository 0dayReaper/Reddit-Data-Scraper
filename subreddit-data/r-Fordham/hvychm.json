I love being at my dorm in LC and I really miss it.\n\nOn the other hand, we\u2019re only there until Thanksgiving. And even then, I feel as though there\u2019s gonna be some sorta second wave that send us home even earlier. \n\nNot to mention, there going to be hardly any campus activities. And I wouldn\u2019t feel safe going to any parties or bars \n\nIs it even worth it to go? I can hardly decide",

But it\u2019s totally valid not to go back \u2014 I think the two things really pushing me to return to campus are the fact that I have covid antibodies and that my scholarships allow me to go at a relatively low cost. It\u2019s really frustrating trying to navigate this situation.",

Currently we have to request accommodations from human resources if we want to teach online but I've heard whispers they are planning on giving professors / instructors full discretion over the format of their fall course.. For myself, I am planning on choosing \"Hybrid\" but will survey students preferences in early August. If people don't feel safe, I am not making anyone come to campus. No should risk their life to hear me lecture through a mask.",

The idea of not having library / office access was a huge bummer.. Also, given all the precautions Fordham claims to be taking, parts of campus may be safer than the grocery store. My plan is to ask students their preference. If I have 14 students who don't want to meet on campus, then I'll meet with them digitally once a week. The others, I'll divide and meet them in smaller social distant groups.. Perhaps on Eddies. We'll see.\n\n To clarify, all Hybrid means is that there'll be synchronous and asynchronous components and some of the synchronous components \\*might\\* take place in person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Edit: Clarification.)",

            "comment": "Just about all of the major laptop retail stores and companies offer student discounts. You can call Fordham\u2019s IT Customer Care to see if they have additional savings for a new computer 718-817-3999.\n\nI don\u2019t think Fordham sells computers but they have a good loaner program. I accidentally dropped my laptop last year when all of my classes were online. Fordham overnighted a brand new laptop to me as a loaner while mine was being fixed. I then returned it at the end of the semester. \n\nFordham also gives all student free access to Microsoft Office, Antivirus software, Google Suite and a bunch of other software.",

But, depending on what she\u2019s doing, HP\u2019s, Lenovo\u2019s, and other Windows platform laptops work fine. In gavel I, Windows is better for stats classes and excel based financial analysis classes anyway.",

His advice to me and my siblings has always been to buy right from the manufacturer (not through Best Buy or Target or any other store like that). I had a Dell computer, which he bought straight from Dell, and he paid a little extra to get a comprehensive extended warranty- the warranty lasted all through college, and if anything had gone wrong with my laptop, a Dell tech would come to me to fix it (rather than me having to mail it to them for repairs). My dad did this for all of my siblings, and it definitely helped my brothers a couple of times when they dropped their computers!",

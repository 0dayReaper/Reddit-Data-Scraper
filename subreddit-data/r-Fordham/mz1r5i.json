    "postText": "My brain is so tired and foggy and I can barely focus anymore. I\u2019m so frustrated with the fact that we got essentially no time off and that we also can\u2019t pass/fail a class (at least for me as a freshman). I\u2019ve worked my ass off this whole semester and done pretty well but I\u2019m super anxious about the possibility of botching a final and seeing my hard work go down the drain. Im just so tired. Anyone else feeling this way? I really hope it\u2019s not just me",

It's a big transition to go from high school where you are in the top of your class to Fordham where EVERYONE was at the top of their class too.  A degree worth having should be difficult.  But it will also be rewarding - I promise.   It's only making you stronger.   You have been rewarded with this challenge so DO NOT give up.  Fun times will come, I swear.",

If you feel yourself really getting overly anxious don\u2019t hesitate to schedule time at health services to speak with a professionals - don\u2019t forget it\u2019s just college, not worth sacrificing your personal health over.",

IMO a job is easier.... you're getting paid first of all not paying, and second its confined to your work hours. school can be all consuming, homework after class every day, having to study, papers due on the weekends at 11:59, concrete grades at the end.",

    "postText": "I applied as a transfer student to Fordham for the Fall 2023 semester. Sent in all of my application materials at the end of March, but I haven't heard back. The follow up email I got from admissions after submitting my application said that decisions are sent 10-15 business days upon receipt of all application materials. Doesn't look like anything is missing on my portal. Should I contact the admissions office or just wait? I'm worried because Fordham transfer is rolling admissions and I don't want my application to be looked at too late into the cycle.\n\nUPDATE: Emailed and never got a response back, but I got my acceptance today.",

    "postText": "First of all, the day is likely going to be rained out. Lovely given it hasn't rained in over a week, and it also won't rain for the next week besides Saturday, so that's just beautiful luck the Class of 2023 has \u2764\ufe0f\n\nSecond, I just thought there would be more insight into the ceremonies. I had to drill my girlfriend's friend about how commencement worked last year for his sister, for information about seating, name-calling etc. Like cool, I guess everyone else knows how college graduations work because they have parents and siblings that attended college but for first-gen students its sort of irritating. I've also heard before that it's set up horribly and is very confusing. \n\nThey had an \"information session\" back in April but I had class and asked if it would be recorded. They said yes but there was no link ever sent or posted \ud83d\ude00 \n\nAlso I don't know if this is a controversial take but I wish the graduation was elsewhere. I guess tradition trumps all though (I'm an LC student so I don't really have a connection to the campus anyway lol) It'll be fun walking on wet grass \ud83e\udee0",

I got an email last week from the FCRH Senior Dean about commencement day FAQs. It answered basic questions about when to arrive, where to line up, what to wear, and where you and your guests will sit. I don\u2019t even know how name calling will work since that wasn\u2019t mentioned in the email. The email was specific for FCRH students about where we should meet up, but I\u2019ve talked to friends from FCLC and they didn\u2019t get any email like this which is surprising. The lack of communication about commencement is definitely annoying and it seems like they assume we should just show up and go with the flow.",

    "postText": "Hey guys\n\nIm in the Manresa program next year and am debating whether I should take math and democracy or sinners and saints for my manresa course. I want to take math and democracy because it is much more interesting. However, because I might transfer to gabelli, math and democracy wont fulfill a core requirement, but my religion course will. What do you guys think I should do. Is the math and democracy course actually interesting? or is it VERY boring?",

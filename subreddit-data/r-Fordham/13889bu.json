    "postText": "Hi! I was recently accepted into Fordham\u2019s PCS program as a non-traditional transfer student. There are a lot of things about Fordham that appeal to me but I am worried about a few things. My major is Mathematics which will require me to take classes on the RH campus (which I am completely fine with). Does anyone have experience with splitting their course load amongst the different campuses? I\u2019ve been told that 50% of courses for PCS must be taken at night/not through the day school. I\u2019m still a little confused about the scheduling. I plan to reach out for clarification but I feel silly because the counselor already explained a lot of the system. \n\nAnyone in here a Math major? What is the department like? Is there strong collaboration between undergrads and grad students? Do students get together ever to prepare for the MCM or Putnam? \n\nSorry for so many questions! I just feel nervous to commit because it\u2019s been super hard for me to prepare to finish my degree. I want to feel comfortable and sure. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Not a Math major but you can split 50% of your classes to another campus. Most classes at PCS are generally night classes (6pm to 9pm). You will have some classes where you will be with traditional students and may be during the morning/day. But don\u2019t worry to much, your advisor will schedule your first semester for you.",

I don\u2019t think it will make any difference because there are some PCS students and GSB students in the same classes. \n\nJust work hard and do your best and that\u2019s all that matters.",

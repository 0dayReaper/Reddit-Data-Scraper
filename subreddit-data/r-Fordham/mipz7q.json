    "postText": "Every few days we get a post on r/Fordham asking for housing recommendations and I thought it would be best to make a more comprehensive list/ ranking for freshman housing at Rose Hill so people don't have to write the same responses over and over.\n\n# Overall, here is my rank of housing:\n\n* 1. Loyola Hall/ Faber Hall\n\n&gt; Best rooms. People call it \"Hotel Loyola\" because it's so nice and new. Must apply to get in. Faber is connected physically to Loyola and is currently being used for COVID quarantine, but it will probably go back to being a freshman hall next year. I've never been inside Faber but I heard that people like it a lot.\n\n* 2. Queen's Court\n\n&gt; Hogwarts-y feel. Students sign a pledge to be alcohol/drug free, so this hall tends to attract more studious students *however* it's kind of an open secret that most Queens residents break that pledge. Arguably the most beautiful hall with its Gothic architecture. Residents have to attend regular meetings where they meet other residents, so it's known for having a great community vibe.\n\n* 3. (Tie) Alumni Court South and Loschert Hall\n\n&gt; South and Loschert are architecturally exactly the same, just two separate buildings. The rooms are nicer than most schools (except they're the only non-air-conditioned ones) and they house the majority of freshmen. They both have elevators. South and Loschert also have the reputation of housing more party-type students, although almost all partying is off-campus.\n\n* 5. Martyr's Court Jogues\n\n&gt; If you're a science major, this should be your number one choice. In SILC, you get free tutors, STEM-focused programs, and the majority of the building will be studying at the same time and relaxing at the same time so it's easy to find friends. Weirdly, you can't visit people from Martyr's Court Lalande-Goupil because they want to preserve the benefits of the ILC. I only rank it low because the Martyr's rooms are smaller than the rest and there are no elevators. I rank it above the rest of Martyr's because of the SILC benefits.\n\n* 6. Martyr's Court Lalande-Goupil\n\n&gt; Pretty much everyone agrees that Martyr's has the worst freshman dorms, but I should stress that they're really the *standard* at most schools. They're your classic cinder-block-with-closet dorm room that you see at pretty much every school. They're air-conditioned, which is nice in the fall and spring, and the bathrooms were newly remodeled, so they're probably better than when I was a freshman. There are no elevators, so if you live on the fourth floor, you have to walk up four flights of stairs, but you get used to it quickly. They have a nice lawn and host the Spring Weekend concert at the end of the year. Again, there's nothing special about Martyr's, but it's not awful either.\n\n# Integrated Learning Communities (ILCs)\n\nThere are three Integrated Learning Communities (ILCs) to choose from, each with their own theme. They increase the value of your housing, but you do have to apply to get in.\n\nIf you're an incoming science major, I highly recommend Martyr's Court Jogues for the Science Integrated Learning Community (SILC). [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fordham/comments/jvvn6s/queens_court_vs_martyrs_court_joques_hall/gcomdzp/) a link to my reasons why.\n\nIf you're a business/humanities major, I recommend Loyola's Manresa Program ILC for the service, but it's also the most comfortable hall by far.\n\nIf you're any major and looking for a close-knit community, I recommend Queen's Court's ILC. The rooms look like Hogwarts, too.\n\n# Roommate Selection\n\nA small portion of freshmen want to live with someone from their hometown or someone who they met on Facebook/other means. In the summer before you move in, you'll get a form asking if you have selected a roommate. Because most freshmen don't know each other, there is a lot of flexibility in housing assignments so most freshmen who ask for a particular roommate get that roommate. You may get an added (random) third if you are placed in a triple. Also note that this doesn't apply to sophomore-senior transfers, who are put at the end of the housing lottery. \n\nIf you don't happen to find someone to live with, don't worry. The vast majority (like probably &gt;90%) of freshmen live with a random roommate. You'll get a form asking about different qualities you have like how late you stay up, whether you want guests in the room, if you drink/smoke, how clean you are, etc. and then Res Life uses some software to match people based on their preferences. My experience has been that the software works really really well. My random freshman year roommate and I are still friends and most people are not totally at odds with their roommate. You'll also sign a mandatory \"roommate agreement\" regarding different preferences once you move in. If there are too many breaches of the roommate agreement, you can speak to Res Life and choose to move into another room.\n\n**Feel free to add any information I might have missed or ask any questions.**\n\nEDIT: added roommate selection for those asking",

The air conditioning aspect was really only annoying the first week or two of school then it didn\u2019t matter. I think an important aspect is definitely who is on your floor and the dynamic. Most of my wing were good friends after a month so there was a lot of partying, smoking in the bathroom, helping sneak people in, hanging out in the lounge after a night out etc etc. I definitely recommend people make an effort to get to know their neighbors even if you don\u2019t think you have much in common, you\u2019re all in the same boat freshman year and the more people you enjoy it with the better the memories.",

Queens is filled with the weirdest people on campus, don\u2019t expect to have a good social life outside of queens if you go there. Loschert, South, Martyers are the best for social life in that order, however they\u2019re all pretty similiar. Martyrs rooms are a lil smaller than Loschert and South, but are also a lil nicer.",

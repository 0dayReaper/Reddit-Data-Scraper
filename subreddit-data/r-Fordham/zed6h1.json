What will be helpful for the professor is if you provide them with additional information about yourself/interests/academic and professional background. When students ask me for letters, I always ask them to send me:\n\n* Info about the thing they're applying for and why they are applying for it/what their goals are/how it will help them (this helps me shape the narrative of the letter)\n* What kinds of things they would like me to make sure I mention or discuss (if they have things in mind, sometimes they do and sometimes they don't)\n* Depending on the thing, sometimes I will also ask them for their resume or a bullet point equivalent of a resume just so I can reference additional specific details about them",

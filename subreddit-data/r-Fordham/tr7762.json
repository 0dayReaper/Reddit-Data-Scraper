I want to go on a pre health track and major is psych/neuroscience. I hope to become a PA one day.  Is Fordham LC worth the tuition ?",

            "comment": "No, especially since you\u2019ll be in school for a long time (with becoming a PA) you have to look at how much debt you\u2019ll graduate with from both undergrad and grad school. Also, Fordham is notorious for having a terrible pre health program; it\u2019s overpriced and you won\u2019t receive as much support as you would from other schools, and there\u2019s also grade deflation making it more difficult to do well and compete with students from other schools. I\u2019m not sure about TJU but Montclair has a really good reputation (I\u2019m from PA originally if that helps) and would be a great option",

The day before I was set to move in, I got an email informing me about a new third person being added to my room. Chances are they are still shuffling people around, and you'll hear about your new roommate before the semester starts. Also, let's be honest, Fordham's room selection process is quite sexist, if you've been in McKeon, nearly 100% of boys are put in rooms of 3, I've not seen a single exception. Girls on the other hand, they have more than enough 2 person rooms allocated to them. So... it kinda depends on your sex. Good luck.",

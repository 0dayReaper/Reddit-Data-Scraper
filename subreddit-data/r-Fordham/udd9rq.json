    "postText": "In need of advice surrounding my major for this coming year. Shat is the best option within Gabelli in your opinion. I want to enroll specifically at Gabelli because of the name behind it, however I\u2019ve been really enjoying computer science in school. Should I take up Info Systems, or do a different major in Gabelli with a minor in comp sci so I could get better jobs after school.",

            "comment": "Gabelli is really good in exposing you to every major/primary concentration you can take in the two years before you have to make a decision. You'll have plenty of time and experience when it comes to that decision. As far as the \"best\" major goes, there is definitely a lot of support and background in place for the accounting majors and concentrations. There's always Business Admin if you're decided or split on what you want to do, which allows you to pick two \"concentrations\" - one primary and one optional secondary areas of focus, which allows you to look into multiple areas of interest (That's what I do -- accounting and bus law/ethics)\n\nFor info systems, there's plenty of options, from pure Info Systems majors to majors that apply info systems to another area of business (Accounting Info Systems), to having it as one of your concentrations in a business administration major and looking at another field as well. I would warn you however that Info Systems can be pretty different from typical computer science, as it tends to focus primarily on database management and company internet resource development in my experience, but you should have two Info Systems courses under your belt by when you have to declare, so you should be able to know if the info systems curriculum matches your interests in compsci by that time.",

You can easily switch majors from GSB to FC and still graduate on time after a year, and you can change majors within Gabelli after two years and still graduate in 4 years.\n\nGood luck! Enjoy the rest of high school!",

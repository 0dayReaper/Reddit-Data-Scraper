Now that I know what I know, my grades will be extremely good. My question would is what does Fordham look for in a transfer student? Extracurriculars? Volunteering? Student Senate? etc. \n\nFeel free me message me with any advice or information. Thank you",

From what i\u2019ve heard from advisors is that colleges will care a lot more about ur grades in college and can over look ur high school grades if you do really well at CC.",

            "comment": "If you're planning to transfer after two years, your grades at community college will be far more important and Fordham could overlook your bad performance in highschool. \n\nI would highly recommend looking into doing additional volunteer work, internships, and taking standardized testing (SAT or ACT) to help improve your chances of getting in and to net yourself some additional financial aid if you're admitted. The price to attend is the main problem with Fordham! So even if you get in, your budget might not be able to pay tuition. Try and get as much aid as possible.\n\nGood luck.",

I wasn\u2019t granted admission the first time around because of my 2 point something high school gpa when I applied, then I had to go to community college to prove my worth, maintained a 3.968 gpa and got in. I didn\u2019t do any extracurricular activities nor volunteering, really nothing. I\u2019m was majoring in a AS for Comp Sci at QCC, but now I\u2019m continuing with it for a BS now. I\u2019m not very social and don\u2019t like doing activities relating to school whenever it\u2019s in my free-time so I just never did things like that, but I still got in. Though, tuition is hella bread lol. I\u2019m considering joining NROTC to alleviate my family\u2019s pain to pay for college, as I\u2019m interested in a military career anyway and going to college is the best way to do it imo. My roommate is a Gabelli student, finance major, hmu if you have questions, I can ask for ya.",

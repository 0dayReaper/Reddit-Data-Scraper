How do I politely tell him no without hurting his feelings?\n\nI know if I tell him straight up \u201cno\u201d then he\u2019ll ask why and make me the villain and he tends to blow things out of proportion. Any tips?",

She goes to bed early and I stay up late and she often is up much earlier than me which does tend to wake me up as she\u2019s not a particularly quiet person. Try to make it sound like an appealing arrangement to them too ig.",

    "postText": "Any Bio majors out there? Spoke to a super condescending professor today at Open House and was wondering if it was a gender bias issue b/c he seemed to have made a snap decision about my abilities in under 30 seconds. Are females well represented in the Bio faculty? Also he said that they only want seniors in research and that not just anyone can do research while looking down his nose at me. His attitude was a big turn off and I was ready to commit until meeting him. Any input about the program, the rigor, and the opportunities and job outcomes are welcome. Not interested in pre-med, but so far interested interested in the intersection of animal sciences, conservation, and Bioinformatics. Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "postText": "hi, I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I got in to the LC campus. I\u2019m really thinking of committing and I\u2019ve been on one tour of this campus, I really liked it! But I\u2019ve heard a lot of people say it\u2019s really limited in facilities and feels like a high school??? I really don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m still in high school, especially since the LC campus is literally 5 blocks away from my high school \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d any advice or thought in general about LC campus?",

(i will admit i rarely participated in clubs or anything though, work and internships were my priority- so maybe it\u2019s different). \n\nthat being said, i loved being at lincoln center. you are SO close to everything, especially internships. (i can\u2019t imagine the internship commute situation at RH honestly). i like the fact that even though the campus is just a few buildings in the middle of the city, there\u2019s still the plaza, a dedicated green space just for students, which i thought helped keep the campus atmosphere despite the unique set-up at LC. \n\nif you\u2019re looking for the traditional, sports games, great lawn, college bars, vibe, you won\u2019t find it at LC. if you want to frequently rush broadway shows, study in central park, and have amazing access to the city, LC is great.",

    "postText": "As you may know if you read my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fordham/comments/x46sxi/call_for_fordham_student_solidarity_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)about the solidarity letter, the contingent faculty union at Fordham is currently bargaining with the university administration for a new contract. We are asking for higher wages (raises that keep up with inflation), equal pay for faculty across subject areas (right now, faculty in social work and religion get paid about $2500 less per class), and health insurance.\n\nWe are asking all of our supporters to join us and WEAR PURPLE on Thursday and Friday of this week as a coordinated effort to show the administration that 1) we are organized, we can pull off a coordinated color day, and 2) it\u2019s not just us, we have allies (students, staff, tenure track faculty) who are with us too.\n\nAny kind of purple is fine! A hat, a scarf, socks, a sticker, a purple mask, etc\n\nHappy to answer any questions y\u2019all have about the union or our working conditions \u263a\ufe0f\n\n- a part time composition teacher paid $7,000 to teach you for the whole semester",

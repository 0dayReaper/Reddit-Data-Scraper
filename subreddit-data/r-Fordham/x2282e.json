    "postText": "Fordham has always been a dream school for me and it finally kinda feels possible. I really wanted to go here when i graduated from high school but i had beyond awful grades and it wasn\u2019t even on my radar. I have this year left with my AA and if i keep my grades the same i\u2019ll have a 3.75 GPA. I am apart of PTK (cc honors society) and i do model UN and volunteer with animals. My friends and i are also most likely  starting a flag football league for the school. I am currently a business major but i\u2019m interested in economics or international business. I know that it is case to case for everyone but has anyone been in similar shoes as me and gotten in? Thank you!",

The business school IS competitive but I have friends who did less than you and got in. If you've had a less than traditional college experience, there's also the School of Professional and Continuing Studies and they have economics as a major. It is an expensive school but the school does have a great reputation in the NYC area. Go for it!",

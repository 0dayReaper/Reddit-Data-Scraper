    "postText": "Hey everyone! I wanted to make this post sooner, but I\u2019ve been busy.\n\n**First, a little about me:**\n\nI applied to Fordham ED (Meaning this school was my first choice)\n\nI\u2019m an older student (So, not fresh out of highschool)\n\nComputer Science w/ a minor in math\n\nCommuter @ Rosehill\n\nI\u2019ve just completed my first year at Fordham. I\u2019m local, and was already acquainted with the social scene, campus, and the Bronx pre-covid so I was really excited to attend. Despite this, I have to say I\u2019m really disappointed with a lot of things at Fordham (but enjoyed some things as well). I\u2019ll go over everything in lists.\n\n**BAD STUFF:**\n\n* Price: the average cost to attend at Fordham is [$38,000 in tuition ](https://i.gyazo.com/b4380bfa31333f4666fff57785ecac6b.png) alone (not including room and board). Honestly, there are very few schools that you could justify at that price and Fordham is not one of them. I don\u2019t think this is up for debate and it really shouldn\u2019t matter what program you\u2019re in. For undergrad it\u2019s not worth it. And tuition is going up every year (we actually got twice the increase from the break on tuition increase during covid, nice!).\n* Safety: I know that in the couple years, people have caught flak for dissing on the Bronx. I think that a lot of the things that people say about the Bronx aren\u2019t fair, and that some of the stuff borders on just general prejudice and racism. But, at the same time this adversely affects people who are not used to cityscapes and gives the opposite impression that the Bronx is safe. I overheard twice during tours &amp; my own orientation people telling others that the area around Fordham is *completely* safe. This is NOT true. Just to give some of you an idea, [these are just some of the publilc safety alerts we've received in the past year](https://imgur.com/a/krAa7js) including a serial masturbator following girls, robbery, and a student who was slashed in the face by some psycho off-campus with a box cutter. There's many, many other incidents but these are just the ones sent out to students and ones that I remember searching through my email. While I love the Bronx, its unfair to mislead people into thinking this is an area free of strife and violence and perpetuating this idea just gets more people hurt.\n* Class Size: This mostly pertains to STEM and more particularly CS, but it\u2019s so frustrating that college brags about small class size but the reality is that we just have one professor who teaches a *required* course that is unavoidable and fills up instantly as soon as it opens. It\u2019s even more frustrating when you check the professor\u2019s RateMyProfessor and they\u2019re made out to be the devil incarnate with a -666/5 rating. And, since they\u2019re unavoidable you\u2019re shit out of luck for when you finally do register for the course,\n* Grade Deflation: Yep, it\u2019s real. And from the education side of things, it has to be by far the most annoying thing. It just seems like we have classes here where the median grade is a C and professor\u2019s act like it\u2019s normal or \u201cexpected\u201d. My pre-med friends suffered so much in the first semester\u2026 But I\u2019ll touch more on that later. For now, just let it be known that if you\u2019re really aspiring to have that 4.0 that you *really* cannot slack off. There are also no A+\u2019s at Fordham, and an A- is a 3.67 (pain). I had a professor my first semester tell me they had only given out 30 A\u2019s in 30 years of teaching for a required course (I should have dropped). I know plenty of people who excelled and are practically straight A students, but they are consistently working to almost torturous levels. It feels like the work -&gt; academic success is just totally messed and that GPA\u2019s are just way lower than what they should be. Classes are a coinflip where you\u2019ll get some that take practically no work to maintain an A, and others where you\u2019re borderline passing and want to die with the amount of catching up you have to do.\n* Guest Policy: If you\u2019re ever planning on having friends over, or making a sneaky link in the evening in your dorm. Forget about it. The guest policy at Fordham is super strict. You can\u2019t really bring non-students on campus; you\u2019ll be stopped by security and they are *really* strict about this. You also can\u2019t have any residents or friends visit past certain evening hours in your dorm.\n* Social Life: I really struggled at the start of the semester to make friends. I met a bunch of people during orientation, but the gap socially between commuters and residents is just really wide. I think Fordham has tried to address this with commuter events hosted by CSA, but really all these end up being is everyone gets in a line, gets free food, and then leaves. If you want to go out, there\u2019s tons of bars to go to, but a lot of them charge ridiculous covers (sometimes $20) which is crazy compared to what it cost a couple years ago. And people are just very cliquey\u2026 Everyone really just wants to hang out with their established friend group. I think a lot of this stems from covid anxiety and being cautious of others in the city barring certain circumstances.\n* Advisement: I don\u2019t know why, but this seems like it isn\u2019t an issue confined to just me. All of my friends have this same exact issue with advisement; that they\u2019re just so completely unhelpful and useless. My advisor is a really nice guy, but he seriously can\u2019t even do his actual job in *advising* me. I ask basic questions like how dropping a course will affect my GPA and he just constantly sends me to someone else (usually the wrong person). I\u2019ve had at least five interactions just like this, and I found out from my friends that they all have the same problem\u2026 Very annoying.\n* Parking: This is something that obviously only pertains to car commuters. So, Fordham has a gigantic parking garage and parking lot right by the main entrance. It\u2019s almost always empty with the exception being overflow parking for the botanical garden and spring weekend and I think I\u2019ve only ever seen it used during move-in. [Right now, it's $680 for a daily parking pass for the year and $250 for a part-time booklet](https://www.fordham.edu/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/public-safety/services/parking-facilities/rose-hill-campus-parking/). If you\u2019re a guest, or just need to park for a day it\u2019s going to set you back $20 (not counting returns for that same day). Why is it so expensive? I\u2019ve only met three other people who commute by car to Fordham, but considering the fact that the lot is and garage are almost completely empty it just seems so stupid. It shouldn\u2019t even cost half that if anything for commuters to park. It was cheaper for me to park off-campus and just take parking tickets once or twice a week than to pay for a pass both semesters.\n\n**GOOD STUFF:**\n\n* Events: I know I trashed on CSA events but the free food was soooo nice. It got me through some rough days not having to worry about lunch and ensuring that at least once a week combined with other events with free food that I wouldn\u2019t have to pay for food or head home to make something.\n* Facilities: People already know the campus is drop dead gorgeous despite being located in the Bronx, but what they don\u2019t talk about is that the facilities are quite nice (in comparison to other universities I\u2019ve visited). Fordham has also been investing heavily in expanding and the new buildings, gym, and everything else has been amazing. Almost makes me not regret the money I burned on tuition.\n* Discord: Easily the nicest people I\u2019ve met at Fordham have all been through discord. Fordham has a few semi-official discords (The CS one is a 10/10) where you can chat to students and alumni and this is my go-to for when I have a question about classes, events, and general college stuff. I\u2019ve made most of my friends and connections through this, and people also bought food for commuters with their meal plan through it. It\u2019s a great way to ask other students how certain professors and coursework are like too, and to get advice on your schedule. Just be courteous and others will reciprocate.\n* Ram Vans: These are awesome. All the drivers are really nice and it's just super convenient to use. Especially if you want to get down into the city for a day trip.\n* Location: I don\u2019t think there has ever been a time at Fordham where I felt like - if I genuinely put in some effort - that I would be bored. There is always something to do, try, or explore. You can\u2019t go wrong with Little Italy, and if your palette is very specific you\u2019ll find at least one place you can regularly go to. There were also a lot of vacancies and businesses that got run-out during covid, and it looks like a lot of new places have taken up shop which so far have all been really good from what I\u2019ve tried. The zoo and botanical garden being free and available to students with just a five minute walk is awesome, and I haven\u2019t gotten bored of them yet.\n* Diversity: If this is important to you, Fordham has you covered. Fordham is exceptionally diverse, more so than a lot of other schools. I feel like I\u2019ve met more people from abroad in the past semester than I have in the past four years just from walking around campus and attending events. I also haven\u2019t run into anyone exceptionally douchey or the stereotypical rich entitled asshat that I keep hearing about yet. Everyone has their own story and I definitely feel like I connected and empathized with some backgrounds.\n\n**Finally, advice:**\n\n* Do not skip your orientation events! You\u2019ll end up having to make them up, and also some of them give out free Fordham merch so that\u2019s a big plus (I think I got two shirts, a tote bag, and a couple other things).\n* Have fun, but keep it within reason. Fordham can be exceptionally harsh on punishments for misbehavior. Don\u2019t start fights, damage property, or post controversial/hateful content on social media.\n* Classes are hard (especially if you\u2019re pre-med). The library is by far one of the best and most underused facilities at Fordham. I wish I had used it more my first semester. The new campus center also has rooms you can borrow/book to host meetings and study sessions.\n* Talk to your professors! Seriously, if you have a problem or concern just email or talk to your professor after class. You have a lot more room as an academic to negotiate or work things out if you\u2019re having problems in a college setting. This has helped me get the most out of class and has contributed more than anything to keeping my GPA up.\n* Make friends with someone who has a car (or, just have one). It\u2019s just so convenient to have access to a ride and I can\u2019t imagine not having it now. I\u2019ve also helped a lot of  friends out by giving them a lift to get supplies.\n* If you're not getting the financial aid you need, or are taking out tons of loans to attend. Please, please, PLEASE reconsider staying at Fordham. This is an awesome school, but I can only justify going to it by being able to afford it with aid. So many people leave this school with five digits of debt on the closer side to $100k and regret it very, very deeply. Don't be one of those people. Fordham also makes transferring very easy and its always an option if this school ends up not being what you thought it was.\n* Give the Fordham discords a chance. I think there\u2019s also a way to make an introductory post for your class or something through a platform Fordham set up. My year made a snapchat group but tbh I barely met anyone from it and quickly forgot about it.\n* Get a physical ID! I know it can be annoying if you\u2019re the type of person to lose things easily, but I\u2019m not one of those people and it was just so much more convenient for me. Basically everyone I know who used the electronic ID has had problems with it. So definitely opt for a physical imo.\n* If a class is not going well from the get-go, don\u2019t force it. Drop the class. Make use of RateMyProfessor when registering, and if you can I recommend enrolling one extra easy class if you\u2019re anticipating a drop or challenging course. So, just in case you have to drop one of your classes later, you don\u2019t have to worry about going below 12 credits and not being considered full-time (and subsequently losing financial aid).\n* Spend your money wisely because it's very easy to go broke. Those $20 covers and $14 mixed drinks really add up every weekend\u2026 Set a budget and don\u2019t go over it. It\u2019s also very easy to have fun on a budget and you don\u2019t need to spend an egregious amount of money every week to have a great time in the city.\n* Watch out for your friends and (this sounds cliche but its so, so true) if you see something, say something! Save public safety\u2019s phone number in your contacts. **Rosehill is: 718-817-2222** and **Lincoln Center is: 212-636-6076**\n* If you are pre-med, make sure that you understand what you are getting into. There\u2019s a reason that Fordham can boast such high med school acceptance rates and it's not for the reasons you\u2019re being told. [The comments in this post address the issues that currently exist with pre-med at Fordham and a lot of the misconceptions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fordham/comments/egtyxz/fordham_premed/)\n\nHopefullly this is of some use to the class of 2026 (and future Rams). Welcome to Fordham and do your best to enjoy your first semester/year here!",

As a commuter, you'll be separated occasionally to have different discussions and intro stuff. But for tye most part you're with everyone else. Take this time to meet people! Especially during the first day where most people are moving in.\n\nI'm a little older and super busy, so it wasn't easy to make friends. And after the first week it seemed like everyone else had found their group and I was out. But, I did make some friends later and went out quite a bit. You have to make an effort, even more so as a commuter. It's not depressing if you try your best.\n\nMy advice to you would be to plan to have a student apartment by next year. Three hours of commuting daily is just not sustainable and will wear you down. \n\nMain discord: https://discord.gg/CXTwth9Z\nFordham CS: https://discord.gg/VF3MVNbvga\n\nBoth are active.",

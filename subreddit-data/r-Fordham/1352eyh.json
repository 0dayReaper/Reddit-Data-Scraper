    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a female student studying at Rose Hill and I'm looking for a sublease for Spring 2024 (Jan - May). If you happen to be subletting for Fall 2024 (August/Sep - Dec), I would be interested in taking that too! \n\nI'm looking for a place close to campus, so commuting won't be a hassle. I prefer to live with someone else since it's safer and I would love to have a roommate.\n\nMy budget is around $1000 per month, so if you have a place in mind that fits my criteria, please DM me so we can discuss further details.\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

I got accepted on the 11th of November however I was one of the first applications that was looked at because I submitted my app about 2 weeks before the deadline. They usually take 10-15 business days to evaluate your app AFTER all app materials are received by the school and are reflected on your applicant portal. If it\u2019s past the 15 business days since all of your app materials have been approved. Contact the transfer counselor he may be able to help you. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d",

I just got accepted as a spring transfer to Fordham:) I would email them, specifically email Jose Olivares directly or else they probably won't get back to you, it took them weeks to get back to me. He told me they release decisions on Fridays, so I'd ask about your application and make sure they have all the information they need so they can hopefully get back to you next Friday. good luck!",

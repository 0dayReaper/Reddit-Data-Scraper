    "postText": "Hello everyone, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware, Fordham is mandating the latest booster for all students and staff. Being that Fordham is one of the only universities in the country to do so, there are a growing number of students, staff, parents, and alumni that are unhappy with this decision. I have attached below a link to a letter that will be sent to Fordham administration asking that the mandate be changed to a recommendation so members of the Fordham community can make their own decisions about their personal health. Please consider reading this letter and signing it:\n\n[https://forms.gle/fQv6VioYVwQd38sX8](https://forms.gle/fQv6VioYVwQd38sX8)",

            "comment": "I didn\u2019t attend Fordham so I cannot sign the letter but I must say that it\u2019s very strongly worded and is very articulately written. I highly recommend putting in another section in your letter about how other Nordic countries such as Denmark and Norway are only offering the fall booster to older people &gt; 50 years and 65 years respectively. Additionally, none of those countries have even approved the BA4/5 booster. IIRC, US is the only country where the approval of this untested booster was rammed through, and now it\u2019s not a surprise that no one wants it. Even if 100% of the colleges were to mandate it for everyone, including those who already got their first booster last year, the national uptake would still not cross 15%.",

I cited a few things in it to try and backup my belief. They reviewed it and rejected it right away.\n\nI don\u2019t have hope that Fordham will allow exemptions through. I haven\u2019t met anyone who got an exemption either. To me it sounds like they say they allow exemptions when in reality, they don\u2019t. So I wouldn\u2019t count on it.",

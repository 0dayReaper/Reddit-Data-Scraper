    "postText": "Hi! I was accepted into the class of 2027 and I love the idea of going to Fordham but I am a little skeptical about the social scene there. I know there are no frats and it\u2019s mainly off campus bars and clubs so I just wanted to know how fun it actually is. As a freshman, can we get into the bars/clubs or the off campus parties at all? And are there parties for the first couple of days on campus or is it really just weekends? If anyone could give me the run down that would be great.",

I\u2019ve seen some videos of people parting at bars though, so that might be more common. (This is coming from someone who has seen pictures and videos of Fordham students, but I do feel like Fordham has a more social life than schools like CUNY\u2019s and NYU, since again, specifically rose hill, is a campus. Many don\u2019t live in the city as well, so they might want to socialize with people).",

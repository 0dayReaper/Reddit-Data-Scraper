They're now technically \"Jesuit-influenced\" but not run by Jesuits or beholden to the Jesuit order in any official way. I randomly wrote a paper on this at Fordham and think it was a good move by them to keep the school competitive, but still somewhat of a misconception between students/alum (which Fordham seems to be peddling). \n\nThis is probably why it has that feeling of some Catholic influence but not overbearing.",

I think both of my theology professors (at least one) was a layperson, but I took multiple film classes with a Jesuit professor.  Many of my close friends went to Sunday night mass every week, and I assume I went to the University Church on some tours and never again?  Other friends were lapsed Catholics like myself, but I was still involved in Global Outreach which definitely had a spiritual component. And another classmate became a Jesuit priest himself and several did JVC after graduation. So TL;DR, you\u2019ll probably find like-minded people no matter what, but it\u2019s not like the Jesuit version of BYU or Liberty, etc.",

I'm not sure what you mean by taking theology \"seriously\" but go to mass and talk to people.\n\nAdministration probably isn't faithful in the way that you're thinking. It's a university and Fordham aspires to be as diverse as possible to cater to as many backgrounds as possible. I found that Fordham was the most diverse of all the university's I visited (including SUNY's) despite what most outsiders would think.",

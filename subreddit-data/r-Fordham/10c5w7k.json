    "postText": "This is an excerpt from an email about a support rally for fordham adjuncts on Thursday. Consider supporting if you\u2019re local. \n\nDue to my contract still being year-to-year with no automatic renewal as of yet. \n  \n     As you (hopefully) know, FFU has been in contract negotiations for 9 months with very little movement by the administration towards our three key issues of a living wage for adjuncts, health coverage for adjuncts and pay parity for adjuncts in Social Work and Divinity.  FFU has successfully voted for strike action on January 30th, though negotiations are ongoing.   We truly do not want to have to strike, but as a lecturer that started at Fordham as an adjunct, Fordham's pay and lack of health coverage is something that makes living almost impossible and that as fellow faculty members we should be treated better. \n\n    To this end, we will be holding a rally on Thursday, Jan 19 @ 12PM in front of the Columbus Avenue entrance to LC.",

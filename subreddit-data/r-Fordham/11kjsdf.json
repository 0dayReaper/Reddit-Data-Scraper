            "comment": "Usually a few blocks away, lowest costs may be around $800 (if you have like one to three roomates), then if you live in a single apartment it could be like $2000. It depends, updated apartments could be up to $3000 a month. And you have to check to see how long your lease is, whether it is 9 months (school year) or 12 months (full year).",

Next fall i will be moving into a different unit in the same building but it is a three bedroom and we will each be paying $1125. I have friends who pay as little as $800-900 or upwards of $1300, it just depends how you go about finding the apartment and what amenities it offers if any. And don't rent through Landseair whatever you do",

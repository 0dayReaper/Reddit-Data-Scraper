    "postText": "Hi, I got admitted to Fordham CS with intention to pursue CE at Columbia. Any info on this program will be helpful. \n- Is the additional year worth it for CS majors?\n- I understand it\u2019s no longer guaranteed but what are chances of getting into CE at Columbia from CS at Fordham?\n- I was offered some yearly merit scholarship at Fordham. I\u2019m guessing that won\u2019t carry to Columbia?\n- Is this program better than pursuing say CS at Rutgers NB where I got admitted?\n- If I don\u2019t end up in Columbia and finish CS at Fordham, how is CS program at Fordham and how are the job prospects?\n- Fordham site says per NY law Fordham CS majors can\u2019t pursue CS at Columbia but only CE? Other majors from Fordham can pursue CS at Columbia. \n\nThanks in advance",

            "comment": "This is correct info. I think as long as Fordham has given you more money than Rutgers then it\u2019s well worth it. The Columbia program is competitive and has a lot of factors you can\u2019t control. You must have above a B+ in all requirement classes and if you get a bad professor, it\u2019s game over for Columbia. Also, I\u2019m not sure if you value another bachelor degree from Columbia after graduation from Fordham with a reputable degree already. \n\nSo, Goto Fordham If they gave you more money. The job prospects are likely the same at Rutgers. Don\u2019t bet on the Columbia acceptance.",

            "comment": "To address your second and third question,\n\n2. I saw in a forum that the acceptance rate was ~40 but the accuracy and applicability for the coming years is dubious at best. Take that with a grain of salt\nEdit: i also was in contact with the physics department at another school with 3-2 engineering at columbia and they said that the recent retraction of the guaranteed admission policy made the acceptance rate difficult to measure given the recency of it all, we\u2019ll just have to see how it goes in the future\n\n3. Probably not, if anything I\u2019d consider 3-2 to be just a transfer with benefits such as compatible curricula and like MAYBE a SLIGHTLY higher acceptance rate than the average transfer student",

    "postText": "Hey all! I'm an incoming grad student at LC this fall in his early twenties, not from NYC. First reddit post too.\n\nI've been exploring housing options around LC/UWS/midtown, specifically within a 30-minute commute in most cases. I've checked out reliable sources like StreetEasy, Zillow, and Wilshire Plaza grad. But as expected, the prices for renting alone at $2300+ exceeds my budget, which I attempt to keep under **$1700.**\n\nSo, that led me to look for shared housing. I'd really appreciate discussion and advice on where to connect with other students searching for shared housing around LC or geographical neighborhoods I might want to look into. If you might be interested in co-renting, feel free to reach out!",

GSAS has a list of people looking for roommates that they email out fairly regularly, and I can email them asking them to send it again if your new to GSAS. If you\u2019re not GSAS though, that won\u2019t be effective. \n\nYour can also try Roomi. That\u2019s how I found mine.",

    "postText": "I look forward to attending but I have just a few questions\n\n1. My family's main concern about Fordham is safety since I will be attending rose hill. I am sure this question has been asked many times. However, can I get a breakdown of safety situation at rose hill or are they just being dramatic?\n2. Is the food still bad or is it decent?\n3. I will be starting a semester late. Any tips for catching up with the rest of the freshman class?\n4. Lastly, any tips or tricks with getting as much financial aid as possible?",

Nothing tends to happen during the day, but don't advise do anything at around 10PM - 4AM, since those are the times people tend to rob and harrass students.\n2. It was terrible before but has gotten decent, still prefer outside food since there are a lot of good delis, pizza shops and a chipotle.\n3. Your dean will be the most helpful here, always go to them. They'll help you with scheduling to get you caught up.\n4. Sign up for NYS TAP if you have been a NY resident for at least 1 year, will get you more aid. If you get work study, sign up for that and it will help, be a commuter close to the school so that way they'll still give you the metro grant.",

It's less than a 5 minute walk from campus in a student-only, very social building with access to a backyard. It's pay by room as of now so could be a good option for you. \n\nAs for the rest of your questions, safety is honestly not something I really worry about in the Fordham area, the whole scope of where you will be walking at night is probably 5 blocks so not terrible and public safety is usually out at night. the food on campus sucks, nothing else to say about it. For financial aid, just keep calling the office and pushing them for more.",

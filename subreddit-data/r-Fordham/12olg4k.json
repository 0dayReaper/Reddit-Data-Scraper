I\u2019m a guy, looking to take over from June 1st to August 12th ish\u2026 My office is going to be near Times Square, and ideally I don\u2019t wanna be too far from the office or from that part of the city. We can talk rent prices and more in DMs so please reach out if you have something that could be useful :) \n\nFeel free to reddit msg me or leave me a text at +19253023447- just indicate that you\u2019re messaging about housing in NYC so I know where you got my number. Thanks!!",

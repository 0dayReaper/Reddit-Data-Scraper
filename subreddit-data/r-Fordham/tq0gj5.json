    "postText": "I feel like I\u2019ve said this before but damn is it hard to make friends here. For context, I was a commuter last semester and now live on campus. My first year was all online. I was hoping that consistently being on campus would help but it\u2019s been almost three months and I still haven\u2019t really met anyone. Trust me when I\u2019ve say i\u2019ve tried clubs and everything in that regard but it\u2019s difficult because everyone shows up there with the friends they already have. I just feel like people aren\u2019t open to meeting someone new and groups have been established already. It sucks because I really wanted to love the school and have a good experience here but I\u2019ve really been more depressed than ever because I feel like I don\u2019t know anyone. Hope someone reads this and gets what I mean",

Don\u2019t blame yourself for it, there isn\u2019t anything wrong with you, unfortunately that\u2019s how it is for a lot of people. It\u2019s also especially hard if you\u2019re on the shyer side. \n\nYou do benefit a lot from being on campus though. If it\u2019s not too much (I know it can be hard) here\u2019s a few things you can try:\n\n- Ask to hang out with your roommate and befriend their friends\n- Talk to someone in one of your classes a few times, and then ask them if they want to grab coffee/lunch right after  \n- Approach those cliques you see in clubs and see if you\u2019d be a good fit in any of them and if they\u2019re open to it\n- Add Fordham kids on Instagram and message them there\n\nFordham is also not the end all be all though, if you don\u2019t really find anyone you really jive with nyc is right there:\n- I saw you like acting so you can meet people through things like improv classes \n- you can meet people online\n- you can go to bars\n- you can get a job and make friends through work(maybe a campus job) \n-  dating apps help too\n- you can reconnect with old friends \n\nI know it\u2019s hard, but that\u2019s how things are. You have to make the initiative, and even when you do you might not meet/make the kinds of relationships you\u2019re looking for. I really do wish you luck! Everybody deserves to enjoy their college experience!",

            "comment": "It's crazy how this sub suddenly comes alive as soon as there's a thread complaining about the issues about being at Fordham. I really wanna love this school, and I definitely *did* when I visited friends here years ago. How awesome the social scene was years ago was one of the main reasons why I wanted to come here in the first place!\n\nI'm not really sure what the root of the problem is, but it definitely started with covid and things haven't gone back to how they used to be at all yet. I spend most of my weekends visiting friends at their schools having a blast with them because I literally can't make friends here. And when I actually try at this school, it just ends up being a huge disappointment.\n\nAlso... as a commuter I really thought the CSA events would help. I mean, you would think an entire week of events just for commuters would make a huge difference. Right??? But no, you go to an events and each one is just a carbon copy of the previous at a different location: You sign-in with a CSA event runner so they make sure people actually attend them, you get in a long line with people who are mostly non-commuters trying to get free food (power to them lol I would do the same thing), everyone gets the food/swag bag and then leaves. It's so depressing. I go to other schools and go out with my friends, have wild parties, and actually *meet* people then come back during the week at Fordham and its just... Bleh.",

It was def easier to make friends before it but there's always a level of \"everyone is on their own shit\"-- people just need to get out of that mode at times. I found myself always being the initiator of convos and what not so if you're able to do that then you'll have a leg up there. I really do think it's because people are too busy with their own shit which is unfortunate--- I think Fordham doesn't not quite make the effort to create environments for that stuff to grow (other than the commuter lounge which is where I found all my friends at)",

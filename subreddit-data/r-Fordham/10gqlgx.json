    "postText": "My Great-Aunt (grandmother's sister) graduated from Fordham university in the 1950's, and she is a proud member of the alumni society she donated a an unspecified amount of money to the school, to me, she left nothing. I dont really know how to ask this, because i dont think anyone has ever attempted to do this before. But, I was wondering if the school can use her funds toward a scholarship for me to go to the school myself being that shes my blood relative and that she would have wanted me to work on an undergraduate degree. I'm 27 yrs old, I have the grades to get in, but how do I go about discussing the money that was donated in her will and ask if it can be used towards my first undergraduate degree?",

You can mention it and it will likely help with your chances of getting in, but it almost certainly won\u2019t be applied to your scholarship. The only way it would work is if there was a stipulation that the money be used exclusively for scholarships for her descendants (which doesn\u2019t  happen).\n\nBest of luck though!",

    "postText": "The cost of tuition/room &amp; board for 4 years, minus my scholarships and parents' support would leave me with about 136k left to pay when I graduate. \n\nI'm currently majoring in psychology at RH and trying to transfer into the Gabelli School of Business for Business Admin with a concentration in finance (and maybe a psych minor if that's sustainable) at RH. And, if I like business and get in, might consider the 5 year MBA program.\n\nIs Fordham worth it? And how hard is it to transfer into Gabelli RH?",

Hell, 136k is hard to manage even at gabelli if you don\u2019t go back into IB. Don\u2019t dig yourself that deep just for Fordham. Loved my time there, but that\u2019s a lot.",

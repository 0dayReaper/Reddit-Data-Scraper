For my art history class and Theo classes both professors were very intent on encouraging ppl to major in their subject. I did receive an invite to enroll into an additional Theo program which would also provide another scholarship. \n\nI felt kinda good about it cuz wow I got a nice lil invite \ud83d\ude0e, so I tell my gf and she responds \u201cah cool, I got that too\u201d",

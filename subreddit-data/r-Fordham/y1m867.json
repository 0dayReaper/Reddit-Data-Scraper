    "postText": "The short version:\n\nFordham Faculty United (the union representing part time faculty and non-tenure track full time faculty at Fordham) is holding a protest on **Friday October 14** during President Tetlow's inauguration. We would LOVE students to join us in solidarity -- just come by and literally stand with us, wear purple if you have it. We're gathering somewhere nearby (place TBD) at **1:30pm** and the ceremony starts at **2**.\n\nThe long version:\n\nWe teach the majority of courses at Fordham, but we're paid a lot less than our tenure-track colleagues. The entry-level rate for part-time faculty in College of Arts and Sciences is only $7,000 per course, or a maximum of $28,000 per year. Folks who have been teaching for many years and have seniority status still only make $8,000 per course (max of $32,000 per year). People in the School of Social Service and the School of Religion make even less-- only $4,500 per course minimum.\n\nWe've been in contract bargaining with the administration since March, but they are still only offering us 3% raises -- when inflation just since the last time we got a raise is more than 5%. My salary for the course I'm teaching now is worth almost $400 less ($374, to be precise) than that same salary when I taught last spring, all due to inflation.\n\nStudent solidarity is SUPER powerful, since the administration knows that y'all are watching and judging them for not treating us well. Us getting a good contract is also important for y'all's education, since when we make less money, we need to take on additional jobs, teach at other schools, or find freelance work, which leaves us with less time to devote to you.\n\nSo, **please join us this Friday at the inauguration on Edward's Parade, 2pm (gathering beforehand). Wear purple if you have it, and bring a sign if you want to!** Happy to answer any questions y'all have in the comments.\n\nEDIT: If you're planning on attending, you can [RSVP here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewJMoFVBrYNK-HqTjGkkjwSA74CVI9JskVsORjzvyOXDZOyA/viewform) so you can receive day-of updates from the union.\n\nIf you're an alum, you will want to [ALSO RSVP to the inauguration here](https://fordham.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a94GMFXeHWIxHtY) so you can get campus access/past security.",

We must support the teacher's right to a fair contract with a wage increase that is comparable to other college professors in the NYC area. Fordham University's tuition is one of the most expensive in the entire country. They can afford to attract high caliber teachers. The students and their families deserve that. I'll be there!",

NYU union is still in bargaining, but the latest offer from the university would put them at $8k minimum (right now, only the highest paid adjuncts at Fordham make $8k). The New School is also in the middle of bargaining, but the university hasn\u2019t made a proposal on compensation yet. The union is asking for $14k. At CUNY, wages are lower because it\u2019s a public school, but for me (I teach composition), the differences in how pay is calculated (at Fordham it\u2019s per course, at CUNY it\u2019s per credit hour) make pay about equivalent, only $20 different.\n\nProfessional nationwide recommendations (from the MLA, same MLA that does the citation style) is $11.5 per course minimum, and that\u2019s NOT adjusting for local cost of living",

Previously, Fordham absolutely had a competitive market advantage across the board (that\u2019s why I started teaching here, pay was about $1200 per course better), but the new CUNY raise has eliminated that gap for any subject where CUNY classes are worth more than 3 credits (like composition)\n\n(For additional context, a living wage for NYC is between $50k and $65k depending on which estimates you use. Lots of part timers at Fordham don\u2019t even make half that even if we teach the most we are allowed to)\n\nOur other main demand is health insurance eligibility. Slightly over half of all part time faculty in the US are eligible for some kind of health benefits. We are not.",

Theres also a sink and mirror in the room so u dont have to go to the communal bathrooms at night/morning to brush teeth. Also the bathrooms and showers are in separate rooms whereas i believe for other first year res halls theyre in the same room. Also theres an elevator which some dont have. Also its the closest first year res hall to the student center and all the academic classroom buildings. Also their RA\u2019s have much larger budgets as a perk of it being the Manresa program so the RA events are nicer.",

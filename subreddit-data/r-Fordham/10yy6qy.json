    "postText": "Hi everyone, these are just a collection of my thoughts about what I've seen on campus as of late so please don't get offended or whatever. I transferred to Fordham and have always been hard-working when it comes to academics and I take my education very seriously. I also fund college completely independently of my parents, so I find that since I have more skin in the game, I take things much more seriously as well. However, a lot of my classmates seem to be unbothered when it comes to academics and don't pay attention in class. \n\nI've heard about this lack of willingness to take education seriously on other social media platforms like Tiktok and through podcasts as well, so I am sure it's not just Fordham students. The main overarching theme is that many students don't actively want to learn the material and gain knowledge from the class, but in recent years, it's more so that students go to college to get an education because their parents force them to. But, even now the college degree is becoming obsolete (that's a topic for another day). There is no longer a drive to learn and improve academic concepts and contribute that knowledge to institutions. \n\nI'm also a student in Gabelli, which probably contributes to what I have been noticing in classes because a lot of the students are here to get the degree and use their connections to get the rest. While I hate to sound like a debbie downer, a lot of kids in Gabelli (not everyone) have parents with great connections, jobs, or even names that tend to carry them wherever they go. While I totally understand and respect their decisions and realize that I don't necessarily have those same advantages, I still get so discouraged that they are disrespectful towards professors and cheat on all of the homework. I've seen kids watching TV or sports games during class, blatantly using their phones in front of the professor, etc. It makes me so unmotivated to continue working hard for my education when I see all of these other kids not even seeming to care. \n\nHas anybody else noticed this behavior on campus? It makes me feel so bad at times but I always try to remember that at the end of the day, I will be better off than any of them will be because of my work ethic and how I take things seriously. IF you have noticed this, how do you go about the situation? And what do you do to not get discouraged about it?",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm in STEM so maybe its a little different. I've noticed this too and it's always like this at the start of every single semester. Just wait until right before midterms and you'll see a quick shift in the behavior of other students.\n\nI think that a big part of it is that 70% of our grade for most classes is dependent on exams (or papers for some class). There's virtually no point in participating in class or giving a shit about what professors are teaching because most it - despite what you would think - has no impact on your grade or performance on exams. \n\nI don't think that its entirely the fault of the professors, since they can't completely decide every single intricacy of their course (it all has to be approved) and its not like they can just spend every single class on just exam material. So this is what we get instead. Perpetual review of assignments/readings that play very little if any role on your grade every single class. And of course most people just tune out.\n\nYou shouldn't let it bother you though. If you're fully funding your degree you're going to want to get everything you can out of these classes. I found some of my courses - even ones that had nothing to do with my major - to be extremely engaging and interesting and in those classes I participated and gave my full attention. But I've also been in classes where I'm just tuning out or doing work for other classes (like the one I'm in right now lmao). Focus on YOU first and foremost. If people are uses laptops ahead of you and its distracting, then move to sit up front. I'm sure professors notice who is paying attention and who isn't so its probably to your benefit.\n\nIf you slip up you'll find that grad school options will slowly slim down as your GPA falls and that's a totally different ball game from undergrad. If that's important to you then that should be more than enough motivation to keep working hard.",

I\u2019ve seen a lot of students who seem motivated and actual cares. GSB is what we make it to be. If you\u2019re on top of your shit and making the right moves, you will get places and if you aren\u2019t, well that\u2019s on you. Don\u2019t let it bother you because just like you I am 100% responsible for my own tuition and I treat education very serious.",

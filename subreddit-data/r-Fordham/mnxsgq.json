Anyone finding it hard to concentrate on their classes? Like I feel like they\u2019re just throwing information and I\u2019m expected write a paper on it. I\u2019m very disappointed in the administration for not taking mental health seriously. I cant even take days off bc I feel like I will be behind.",

The therapists and counselors (from my experience) at Fordham have been really great. You are able to have 11 sessions for free and it\u2019s a way to be able to talk to someone once a week to manage stress/anxiety etc on anything you may be going through. I also recommend (if possible) to do a self care day once a week. This could look like going in a walk in nature, talking to friends, or doing a new activity you enjoy. Also, if you go to LC I sometimes do (socially distanced) runs and yoga sessions with my fianc\u00e9 and some friends as a way to destress. Also you will be in my thoughts and prayers and I\u2019ll be sending you light. \u2764\ufe0f",

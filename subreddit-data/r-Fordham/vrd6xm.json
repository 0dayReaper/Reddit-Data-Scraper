    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman (Gabelli at RH) and my major (information systems) isn't offered at LC, but I love LC and would do anything to go to class there. So is it possible that I register for some of my classes at LC? Do I have to choose a minor only offered at LC? If so then is it possible to have two minors and still graduate at the same time as everyone? If anyone has done this going back and forth between 2 campuses can u please tell me what it's like?  Thanks a lot!",

            "comment": "You can take any classes at LC, there was a requirement that core classes needed to be taken at your home campus but I vaguely remember that being lifted, ask your advisor. Anything else feel free, you get ram van passes to get down there, no need to specifically minor in something offered at LC. 2 minors is definitely possible but obviously depends on which minors and how they overlap with your major, but your advisor will help you sort that out. You can also check on degreeworks \u201cwhat if\u201d to see all the requirements you\u2019d need if you selected a particular major/minor",

            "comment": "The Gabelli program is mostly centered at RH, that\u2019s why the traditional majors and courses are at RH while only the Global Business major is offered at GBLC. \n\nYou can take some of your core classes, minor classes, or even electives for your major at LC if you want. The only restriction is that you have to take 60% of your courses at your home campus and your major classes need to be at your home campus (though advisors and deans can waive that)\n\nSo you dont have to pick a minor at LC to take classes at LC but of course, you\u2019re free to. A lot of students end up picking up a second major or minor, its super popular just because a lot of classes are interdisciplinary and count for multiple things.\n\nFinally, while it is doable to move between campuses for class, in my experience it\u2019s not often done by the people I knew or myself. You have to account for the travel time and sometimes it just sucks having to do that. It\u2019s up to your personal preference though. I preferred just walking five min to class then having back to back and getting classes out of the way.",

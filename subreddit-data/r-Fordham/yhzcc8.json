They don\u2019t speak much English and there\u2019s loud music blasting 24/7 but it kinda just adds to the charm lol. I was a little intimidated at first tbh butDominic lines you up real nice and is a good dude once he starts to recognize you. Been going there for 3 years and am gonna miss it after graduation",

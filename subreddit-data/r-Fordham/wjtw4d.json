    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\n\tso I recently had to submit a SAP appeal to Fordham because my GPA went below a 2.75 and I lost my scholarships. When a Financial Aid (SAP) Appeal is required, this means that the student did not meet Satisfactory Academic Progress. In order for Financial Aid to be reinstated, the student must file a Financial Aid (SAP) Appeal. Fordham barely had any information about this when I was going through it this summer and it made me lose my mind so I thought I\u2019d shed some light on this looong process. So the best thing to do after you realize you sunk below the GPA threshold is to talk to your counselor. They can give you a little but more information about what the appeal entails and how you should go about it. Secondly, you won\u2019t be able to access the SAP appeal until they email you the form (It will be an automatic email sent to your .edu after they realize you went below the threshold). Third, you should have a reason for why your GPA dropped (Death in immediate circle, Illness, Injury, etc.), this will be the bulk of the appeal. After you detail why your GPA dropped you should explain what you will do academically if the appeal is granted (i.e create a study plan, go to the library more, participate in office hours, go to tutoring, etc). After you submit the appeal you will have to wait AWHILE until it is approved. (Mine basically took a month and a half). After your appeal is hopefully accepted, then you will have to call financial aid and ask for a Appeals Checklist for  - Continuing Students. (As annoying as it is, this second appeal form can only be done after your SAP appeal is accepted) You have to do this second appeal because the SAP appeal is only for federal aid and this appeal is for institutional aid. This appeal took about three weeks. FYI: they will only grant your institutional aid for the Fall until you get your GPA back up. If you\u2019re nearing the end of summer and they still haven\u2019t processed your second appeal, don\u2019t be afraid to call financial aid and plead your case (some financial aid counselors can put notices on appeals)\n\nTLDR: If you lost your scholarship due to low GPA, there is an appeal process at Fordham that can help you get your aid back temporarily until you can get your GPA back up. TALK TO YOUR COUNSELOR OR A FINANCIAL AID COUNSELOR \n\nhope this helps fr :) feel free to ask any questions \n\np.s calling/ emailing financial aid can be a pain in the ass so just be prepared and don\u2019t let anyone discourage you",

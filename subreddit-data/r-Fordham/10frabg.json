    "postText": "The title really says it all. the university agreed to our most recent proposal in full, which means we now have an agreement. The next step is it gets sent to the full union membership, and we vote on it. If it passes, then it becomes the new contract, and bargaining is over until 2025. \n\nThanks to everyone here who has been supportive of our struggle, and also thanks to everyone who asked good questions, since this does impact all of us and it's really important and good to have discussions as a whole Fordham community.",

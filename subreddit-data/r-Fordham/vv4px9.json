            "comment": "Hi! Im the co-founder and current president of the Chinese cultural club at Fordham LC. Its a straight forward path but you most likely wont be able to have a fully functioning club until next spring or even next year. \n\nFirst reach out to USG (United Student Government). Last year their chair of operations was Rachana. Please dm me for their email.\n\nOnce you reach out to them, they will send you a form to fill out called \u201cclub interest form\u201d. Thats the original screening process. You will need to be able to clearly and thoroughly explain the purpose and significance of your club, why it is necessary at fordham, and other basic information. You can dm me for the link.\n\nAfter that, you would have an in person meeting with the chair, where they will talk to you about the the process, how probable your club will be approved, and they want to learn more about the founder as well!!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThat\u2019s all the information you really need. But i\u2019ll just give you an idea of what\u2019s after.\n\nUSG will share a drive with you. It will contain a sample club constitution, a registration packet, and they will ask you to come up with a sample budget for a semester as well. \n\nThese take a bit of time, and they need to be absolutely perfect in order to be approved by operations committee. You can take as much or as little time as you want to finish these documents.\n\nAfter the vote, if your club is approved, you will get an email with a bunch of information with links for getting rooms, applying for financial assistance for outings, and other important resources. The eboard will have to complete a couple trainings and from there, you\u2019re set!!\n\nTechnically you have a 15 week probation period\u2026 but its really just a temporary limit on how much you can spend and go out. So no big deal for just starting out!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDisclaimer: Not every club gets approved. USG really only approves around 5-6 clubs a year. The club needs to be thoroughly thought out with a clear purpose at Fordham. So if you have an idea, make sure you do research and don\u2019t create a club just because you want to be president or whatever.\n\nBUT!!! Don\u2019t be discouraged!! You wont know unless you try. \u263a\ufe0f\n\nHope that helps, you can reach out to me or reply if you have any other questions.",

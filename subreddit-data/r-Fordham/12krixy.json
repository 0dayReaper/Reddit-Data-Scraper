    "postText": "Hi I am in Gabelli with Bus Admin major and Econ as my concentration. I took Intro Micro and Macro during COVID online and my two req econ electives are pretty easy and not application based. Do you have any recommendations for profs for these classes that I can take next year? I am currently signed up for Shojai for Macro and want to avoid Schenone based on his reviews so I will take Micro in spring because there are more options then.",

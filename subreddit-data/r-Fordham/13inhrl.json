As long as you can secure your transcript, it\u2019s through national clearing house (or something) super easy to send to the school you want to transfer to- you\u2019re good ! Apply as early as possible to the school you want to transfer into. I didn\u2019t need any rec letters or anything",

Your adviser has to fill out a form that confirms your gpa, just send it to them. Go on the the \u201capps\u201d page to send your transcripts straight to the college",

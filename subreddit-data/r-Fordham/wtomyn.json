It is a matter of how everything is packaged and presented. Obviously you have a hard time picking up on nuance. There is blatantly no physical causation/academic injury from orientation to beginning of semester. YET, it is quite significant how the entire experience is packaged. Anyone with an analytical mind would be able to perceive this. \n\nCorrect, I put them in the sentence because one is approximating the other. Reflectively, I am saying that those two words should never be said in the same breath and the fact that they are (by me and actual notable scholars) is QUITE telling. \n\nI understand the benefit of orientation for first years \u2014 still overkill though.

Obviously orientation won\u2019t hurt the academics but your implication is still wrong.

If students can\u2019t find/learn their way around a sizable enclosed campus they have much bigger issues to worry about then attaining a college education. Three days of morning to night orientation is definitely overkill. I understand that Fordham wants to provide initial high support/guidance, but let each student decide whether they would like to avail themselves of it.",

You are sorely wrong in every way conceivable. \n\nFordham does not have the benefactor scholarship listed anywhere on their site. I only found out about it ON Reddit. Further, there is no mention whatsoever of appealing aid twice. Nor is there any mention of their eldest profs still teaching (only emeritus who rarely if ever teach). And lastly, there was no information on the 2022 Fall orientation until\nthis week. Each time I checked it would send me to the summer session guide. \n\nLike any informed consumer, I use all sources available to me to gain info. Fordham\u2019s website has a dearth of information. Your average student isn\u2019t going to find any loopholes on it \u2014 that\u2019s what Reddit/quora is for. \n\nAll of my Fordham concerns asked on Reddit were time sensitive. It would have been far too late to wait for bloody orientation to seek info on appeals and professors for Fall 2022. \n\nAs previously said, and due to my own information seeking, I am now well versed in all things Fordham/bureaucracy. Thank you very much.",

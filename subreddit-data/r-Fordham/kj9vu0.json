Colleges make decisions on a variety of factors, only some have to do with merit.  \n\n\nIn fact, this is a great opportunity for a gut check. Time to look in mirror and double down on you and your dreams and develop plans independent of any given school. Schools are simply vehicles. You are the dream maker. Best of luck.",

Your first year courses need to serve three purposes: (1) to challenge you to perform at university standards in your approach to science/math and the humanities, especially expository writing and methods of argumentation; (2) to give you a breadth of exposure to academic subcultures and categorical topics so that you have an intellectual foundation from which to build the You you want to be; (3) to keep you current with majors that have demanding requirements and for which falling behind and out of sync with. your cohort at a private school all but ends certain pathways.

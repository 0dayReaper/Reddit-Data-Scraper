I found the profs to be pretty accessible for help with understanding the material and also very willing to write LOR when application time came around. \n\nI had a lot of classmates who were Pre-med, Pre-PA, Pre-dental, and Pre-pharm who were all able to get research without too much difficulty. \n\nOnly thing is that Dean Watts isn't at Fordham anymore and they haven't hired a new dean yet for her position. Currently Dr. [Beer](https://www.fordham.edu/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/about/administration-and-staff/) is basically acting as interim",

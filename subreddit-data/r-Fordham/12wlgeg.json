Fill out the application to graduate and select the February date (this is the graduation date for people who complete their credits in the Fall). You\u2019ll get your diploma mailed to you around this time since you graduated early. There is only one ceremony held per year so you\u2019ll still be able to attend the Spring commencement and be with the class of 2024. All grads from Fall, Spring, and Summer are invited to the commencement and you\u2019ll get an email asking if you\u2019re gonna attend. If you have more questions you can email the senior dean.",

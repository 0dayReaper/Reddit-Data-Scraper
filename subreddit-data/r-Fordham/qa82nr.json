    "postText": "Hi! I'm a freshman at RH and I've really been struggling to find people I genuinely clique with. \n\nIn high school I had a SUPER close group of friends so maybe I'm just really used to having people always around, but here I am constantly lonely and its really effecting me emotionally. I know growing close bonds takes time but I haven't even meet anyone I see doing that with...\n\nAnyways I guess I'm just wondering how long it took some of you to find you're people and how you did it?",

The key is that you have to put in the effort while also judging people at the same time to watch for bad apples. I\u2019ve seen a lot of time people languish because they expect other people, especially new friends, to ask them to hangout. Not everyone is like that. Some people are not the initiators. You have the be the initiator in the beginning to solidify and eventually deepen those friendships. It\u2019s a trial and error sort of thing my man.",

That's when I realized I'd found my people here.\n\nI was on the fringes of a couple friend groups before that, all good people, but no one who really *got* me. It was kinda rough at first, I absolutely bawled my eyes out in a stairwell like a month into freshman year because everyone around me seemed to have found their people already. But that didn't mean I never found my people. It just took me a little longer.",

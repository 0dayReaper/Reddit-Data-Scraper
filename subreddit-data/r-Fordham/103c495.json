Are FCRH students able to enroll in Gabelli courses without being a Gabelli major or minor? There are no restrictions or prerequisites listed on the class registration portal.",

Make sure that the class you choose has some importance to your major/minor, otherwise you will only get points as an elective class. At that point, it isn't worth taking a Gabelli class as you'd just be making your workload harder for no real academic recognition. Good luck.",

Here are the opportunities I've dug up.\n\n- Art History: World Art fulfills both Fine Arts and Global Studies.\n- Texts &amp; Contexts: The Immigrant Experience in America fulfills both T&amp;C and American Pluralism.\n- You can fulfill both ICC and values seminar with major-specific values courses. For me, that's Ethics and Economics.\n- Can't give specifics here, but major courses can also count for literature, history, or social sciences core.\n\nHope this helps.",

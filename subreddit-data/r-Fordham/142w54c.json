    "postText": "Hi!! I'm transferring to Fordham LC in the fall and would love to know more about what it is like to be a transfer student at Fordham. Also, I will be a commuter so I don't have to worry abt housing, but I am super worried about my credits transferring. I just completed my first year at a SUNY and I received 30 credits (all A's and one B- in my first semester). If anyone could talk about their experience with their credits transferring and how it went, it would really help me understand what I'm getting into. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you're an incoming transfer, I would love to connect and talk so pls reach out on here or on insta: @ madisonmontoyaa",

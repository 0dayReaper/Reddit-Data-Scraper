    "postText": "Just got accepted into Fordham with a full-tuition scholarship! I'm planning on studying something along the lines of sociology and my goal is to become a high school teacher. Knowing that teacher education programs are generally a hit-or-miss (leaning towards miss), I'd like to know a little bit from any School of Education folks about what their experience has been like (e.g. field experiences, the applicability of class content, the professors, support, etc). Thank you!",

Ik there is a 4+1(ish) program for the teaching masters program so that would def be a good thing to look into to save some money in the long run!!! I\u2019ve had school of edu students take grad school of arts and sciences classes with me so you have options to take classes in area specific topics if you want!",

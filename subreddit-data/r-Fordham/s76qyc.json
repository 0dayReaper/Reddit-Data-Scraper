    "postText": "The email we got just said no indoor eating or drinking whatsoever in lounges, libraries, hallways, or empty classrooms. Commuters aren\u2019t on the meal plan so they can\u2019t eat at the cafeteria, and it\u2019s way too cold out to just casually eat outside. Most fast food places around campus are full during my class breaks, and I have days when I\u2019m at school from 10am to 9pm. Tf am I supposed to do now?",

Did they change that cause of covid? Also can\u2019t you go to the back of the ram cafe? Or did that change too?",

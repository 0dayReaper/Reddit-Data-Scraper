(For context, I'm getting a BA, so my max is 18 creds, but I want to take 20 in the fall)\nAnd does anyone know if they charge you for the extra credits if they DO end up letting you take them?",

            "comment": "they usually approve as long as you have a good GPA but paying more or getting extra credits for free depends on what class you want to take/why you want to take it. if you search for student forms on the fordham website you\u2019ll find the credit overload form and you\u2019ll see that you actually send in a plan of the five classes you want to take and then other supplemental questions. basically if you are taking an elective just because you want to, you can get a course overload scholarship, meaning you won\u2019t need to pay for the extra credits. however, if you\u2019re taking an extra class to speed up your graduation timeline, you will need to pay.\n\nto give you an example, i used the credit overload form three times in junior and senior year to take electives for my major, but i had already met my major requirement for electives, so the deans knew that i was just taking those classes because i wanted to. as long as i was able to justify one out of the five classes on my form being for \u201cacademic enrichment\u201d with no other motive, they gave me the scholarship.\n\neither way, if you have a 3.7 GPA or higher they will let you take an extra course, but the motive behind you wanting to take that extra course is what determines the cost",

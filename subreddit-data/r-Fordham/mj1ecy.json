But also to note, I'm a commuter, so my experience is probably different from a poc who is dorming. And I would say like half of the commuters are poc.",

However, there are a sizable population of Asian students, particularly Indian and Filipinos (who many of which are close together). I\u2019ve met many Hispanic students however most of them are either commuters or not on campus this semester. As for black students there really are not that many in general. If diversity is a big factor for you then Fordham probably isn\u2019t best, however being in the city does have a lot of diversity regardless. Hope this helps",

I think LC is a little better, but at Rose Hill most of the people of color are either commuters or adults in the service staff. it actually bothered me very much, coming from a fairly diverse community at home, and I felt super uncomfortable a lot of the time.",

They are used to the demographics and come from schools that are predominantly white so they don\u2019t see things differently. However if you come from a school where that\u2019s not the case it\u2019s a different story. What kids like this don\u2019t understand is you\u2019re going to feel weird about the demographics if that\u2019s something that you\u2019re not used to. This is why students of color tend to stick together. That said people are super friendly, and it\u2019s more of an internal battle than anything.",

    "postText": "\nHello, I am an incoming freshman in FCRH, majoring in Biological Sciences. Unfortunately, I received a D and an F out of 7 classes during the second semester of my senior year. This was a result of a medical emergency that made me miss the last week of school and prevented me from taking the final exams for those classes. I am concerned whether these grades will rescind my admission to the university. Thanks",

(There\u2019s one that someone\u2019s told me that would leave anyone who hears it just going, \u201cWhat. The. Fuck!\u201d)(Can\u2019t elaborate on things that people tell me in confidence tho)\n\nTo be clear and clarify, everything above is about their responses to a medical event/emergency happening; none is in reference to their knowing about a given condition(they\u2019re very friendly and accommodating on that).",

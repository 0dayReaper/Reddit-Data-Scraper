            "comment": "HEOP for applicants is basically a waiting game\n\nOnce you submit your application for HEOP they will reach out to you with various emails asking for documents. For now, look out for an Email from Fordham within the coming week/s. Be patient.\n\nOnce eligible, they will conduct an interview and your interviewer will ask you questions that aren\u2019t hard at all. It\u2019s just more so then getting to know you. During your interview you want to be as much of yourself as possible and don\u2019t hold back. And have a genuine conversation, don\u2019t just reply to their questions and stay silent. They are very friendly!\n\nNo extra essays are required. Just the interview. Their emails should have all the instructions\n\nI wish you the best of luck in your process!",

    "postText": "Hi guys. I\u2019m a student in Amsterdam who got accepted into the exchange program at Fordham for a semester. I was wondering if you guys had any experience regarding this. I wanted to attend the Lincoln center campus but all exchange students are admitted into rose hill it seems. Anyways, do you guys think the costs are justified? Please let me know. Thank you! Im a media student btw.",

They will probably put you in on-campus housing, which would definitely help your experience. I would say make sure to take advantage of your time in NYC and think intentionally about what programs/professors/centers/clubs you want to get to know at Fordham. There are a lot of great programs at Fordham and in NYC for media students, make sure you take advantage of those connections.",

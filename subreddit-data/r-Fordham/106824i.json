I'm part of the union and we're really concerned to learn that this rumor is going around. \n\nWhile individual class SESSIONS will not be held for the duration of the strike, there shouldn't be any courses getting fully canceled for that reason, and everyone should sign up for any classes they want/need. \n\nPLEASE comment to lmk if you've heard this rumor and/or if you have any more details of what's being said and where it's coming from. It's a really serious issue if someone at Fordham is lying to y'all and saying the strike will hinder your degree progress, and we would like to put a stop to it. And if important classes ARE being canceled for that reason, then that's an even more serious issue (and is almost certainly illegal for Fordham to do)\n\nI just wrote about this in a comment on the other thread about the strike, but your grades/credits won't be affected. Class will just be canceled until the strike is over. You can hit up New School students at their student/faculty solidarity account on Instagram if you want to talk to them about their experience.

I will get a PASSING grade for work I won\u2019t do?  That sounds sweet except for the fact that my parents and I pay a lot of money for tuition at Fordham to get an education. Will Fordham prorate the tuition for every canceled course? I doubt it so now I have to pay all this tuition and not learn anything. I understand faculty are striking to get a fair contract but they are doing it at the expense of our education. Sorry, but is making me angry and have little sympathy for you and the other faculty. There are other ways to demonstrate with our putting students at a disadvantage.  I lost so much learning due to Covid, now I\u2019m going to lose more due to a strike. Sorry but that\u2019s unacceptable.",

                    "comment": "Let me back up.\n\n1. It is currently possible that a strike will not happen at all. If Fordham wants to make new proposals that are acceptable by January 30, we will call it off. I think it's very possible this will happen, and it DID happen at NYU and Mercy College last year.\n2. If a strike does happen, no one knows how long it will last. So it could be just a few days, just a week. Again, that's up to Fordham. \n\nRegarding tuition, prorating or not prorating is up to Fordham, not us. If you divide up annual tuition to a per-class rate and then multiply it by a 16-person composition class, the total tuition that my students pay to take one of my classes is $89,857. I get paid $7,000.  That's the kind of discrepancy we're working with here. At The New School, where folks were on strike last year, parents are now suing the school over it, and it's widely thought that this provided some of the necessary pressure to force the administration to cave on some of the contract provisions. A great example of student/parent/faculty solidarity.  \n\nRegarding the idea of striking at the expense of your education -- a phrase that gets said a lot in education strikes is \"our working conditions are your learning conditions.\" What this means is, we're all in this together. Whenever education workers have a bad contract, it impacts our ability to do our jobs as well, so it hurts the quality of your education too.\n\nSome examples:\n\n1. Because we aren\u2019t paid well, most part-time faculty and some full-time faculty work second (or third, or fourth) jobs, or take on freelance work on the side. This means we have less time and energy to dedicate to our students.\n2. When a part-timer teaches at multiple campuses all over the city (very common), they spend a LOT of time commuting \u2013 this is time that could otherwise be spent on helping students.\n3. When people are stressed, our focus, memory, attention, and other cognitive capabilities are less powerful (unless we are in adrenaline-fueled hyperfocus). This is just a physiological fact. Stress about money, stress about access to healthcare, and stress from being overworked are all kinds of stress that relate to our contract. Less stress means everyone has more cognitive resources to devote to their jobs.\n4. When people have more money, they are able to afford things that save them time and stress. More time overall = more time for students.\n5. More free time also means we might have time to update our courses to make them more timely and relevant for students and fix things that haven\u2019t gone well in the past. Searching for new readings or designing new assignments takes longer than you might think!\n6. Because part-timers are not eligible for health insurance, many people may have to buy much more expensive health insurance, or insurance with worse coverage, resulting in less money and more stress (see above).\n7. If you don\u2019t have health insurance, or you have bad health insurance, you might avoid going to the doctor, or going to the doctor as often. This means you won\u2019t get care you need (preventative care or sick care), which often results in being more seriously sick or being sicker for longer. This disrupts class for everyone.\n\nNobody wants to hurt y'all, and a big reason it took us this long to strike (instead of doing it sometime last semester) is that a lot of folks were hesitant about it specifically because of how it may impact students. But as the months go on and we still don't have a new contract, the situation is getting more and more serious. We ask/hope that you direct your anger/frustrations at the administration, who are the real decision-makers here.",

Of every higher ed strike we know of, not a single student was negatively impacted in their ability to get their grades/course credits and graduate on time, including strikes that happened near the end of the semester, when this would be more of a concern. This includes the strike at Columbia in 2021, which lasted through the end of December finals. \n\nBoth short and long student FAQs can be read here: [https://fordhamfacultyunited.com/for-fordham-students/](https://fordhamfacultyunited.com/for-fordham-students/)\n\nBut I also really encourage you to reach out to students at The New School, whose professors went on strike at the end of last semester, and ask them about their experience.

New school students transcripts were marked incomplete, essentially fucking them over for a semester that they paid for. They're compensating with stuff like hiring \"temporary progress reviewers\" to grade during the strike, but everyone knows the quality and enviroment is nowhere near the same. I can link articles where they had to beg administration to get actual grades instead of an incomplete transcript that they paid for. https://nypost.com/2022/12/17/nyc-new-school-students-demand-tuition-refunds-after-faculty-strike/amp/\n\nWhy should our transcripts suffer when we are literally spending money to be here.

Most New School students weren't given incompletes -- the guidance from both the university and the union was to avoid this. I think it's important to emphasize that even in the article you linked, the students were demanding not \"actual grades,\" but As for all, and were protesting in **support** of the union and the strike. The demands for tuition refunds were also framed as anti-administration and pro-union. In this case, students and faculty members worked closely together and mirrored each other's demands to mutually support one another. Students and faculty also organized teach-ins based on faculty expertise during the strike so everyone could continue learning together about topics that they decided were important to them.\n\nHere's the university's guidance: https://blogs.newschool.edu/community-messages/2022/12/11/resuming-the-semester-plans-for-this-week-and-grading/  \nAnd here's the union's guidance on grades: https://www.youarethenewschool.com/bargaining-blog/reuniting-with-our-students\n\nIt's also important to note that \"incomplete\" grades are always temporary. At Fordham, in order for someone to get an incomplete, both the teacher and the student have to sign an incomplete contract together. \n\nAgain, in these cases where strikes took place at the end of the semester, everyone worked together to make sure transcripts didn't suffer (see my comment to the other person for more details on the timing and how grading deadlines actually hugely impacted the resolution of the strikes).\n\n But in our case, it's incredibly unlikely that the strike would last all the way to the end of the semester. The longest higher ed strike I know of lasted 10 weeks (Columbia, 2021), and that was very unusual. Any applications folks are working on during this semester won't be affected, because all grades for spring are in-progress anyway.",

Once teachers return to the classrooms, we would all need to revise our syllabus/course calendar to account for the missed time, and then class would proceed as normal, and you would just be graded on half a semester's worth of stuff. \n\nBut I think what you're really asking is what happens if it lasts the whole semester (let me stress that this is very unlikely, nobody wants that). Grading deadlines are hugely important not just for students, but for universities as well -- accreditation depends on this, as well as financial aid processing, and registration, and graduation, and other things. What happened at Columbia in 2021 was, they came to an agreement right before the final extended grading deadline. This meant they could prioritize grading for students who were graduating that winter. Then, students who weren't graduating were given temporary placeholder grades (they invented a new code to indicate \"disrupted due to strike\") while the no-longer-striking graduate instructors graded the assignments that had already been done but hadn't been evaluated. This is rare, Columbia insisted on a \"work make up policy\" that doesn't usually happen. \n\nAt The New School, the school was trying to hire replacement graders, but again, an agreement was reached and the strike ended before final grades were due. Faculty were instructed by the university to grade students based on both work completed prior to the strike and any work students completed during the strike on their own. The union voted to support students' demands of no penalties for anyone who didn't attend class or didn't do work during the strike. So, no one was harmed in this way.",

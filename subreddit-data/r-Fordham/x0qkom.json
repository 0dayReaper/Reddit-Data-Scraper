    "postText": "I am one of the best students in my class and have excellent grades. I have a very strong extracurricular profile. I am considering to apply to Fordham Early Decision because I fell in love with NYC when I visited in 2016 and also because of the lovely campus at Rose Hill. I hear the GSB is a very prestigious business school but I want to know if it really is. Can someone tell me about their experience as a business major and if I should apply to Fordham's Business School. Also tell me about the major pros and cons of Gabeli Business School please.\n\nAnd How is the financial aid for need based students?",

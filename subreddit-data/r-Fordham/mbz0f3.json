            "comment": "Love about Fordham:\n\n\\- Fordham's business connections are strong, I've seen many Business school grads get into good companies, specifically if they had internships during junior year.\n\n\\- Pre-law students might benefit from the 5-year accelerated program and jump into Fordham law school without any gap time.\n\nLeast like about the school:\n\n\\-The tuition increases a 3-4k yearly, but your aid will not. After all my scholarships were considered, I still owed 14k in tuition from freshman year. In senior year, that increased to \\~30k in tuition.\n\n\\- Commuters, if you dorm, afterward *you lose your commuter grant/scholarship* for the rest of your years (7K a semester, so a 14k reduction in aid yearly).-  CUNY's annual tuition is 7k, and Fordham's is 50k (54k now) easily with fees and everything assumed. That means Fordham's tuition is *seven times the cost of public school counterparts*. 80-100k in debt for college isn't worth it, and too many grads have it. If you have scholarships for everything, then Fordham may be worth considering.\n\n\\-Racism can happen and I had to explain to some students from OOS (mid west, outside of cities) that there shouldn't be a \"different way of *handling\"* brown asian people to anybody else.\n\nGeneral advice\\*: Regardless of the college you go to, get internships and job experience before senior year.\\* Just because you go to a name-brand school doesn't mean you'll get a good job.\n\nTo answer your last question: As a Computer science major with not enough scholarships to cover all the tuition, if I could turn back time I'd have done 2 years at a CUNY, worked every summer (paid off those 2 years) and then do 2 years at a name brand school like Fordham/nyu.",

For me the environment was great, you\u2019ve got your own community in the Bronx, a beautiful closed campus and you\u2019re Manhattan adjacent - which made work opportunities (internship and just general retail) super accessible and easy. \n\nWhat I liked least were the occasional classes taught by TA\u2019s, or what felt like them. I didn\u2019t like gabelli\u2019s departmental exam for things like accounting and felt like the rules in the dorms were overly strict but that\u2019s on campus living anywhere. \n\nIf I had to do it again I 100% would. I didn\u2019t even have Fordham as my #1 when I was still in high school and the experience absolutely ruled. Also living in New York? Get out of here even if you don\u2019t stay after college it\u2019s still one of the coolest places you can experience by living there.",

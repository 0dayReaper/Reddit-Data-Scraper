I had to pay a credit overage because four classes as a senior is usually normal, but I am doing five in the spring then two over the summer. So you can fill out a form for the fifth, and your dean will have to approve it. Then you can take a seminar for another credit, I can send you the list if you want. Then I think the limit is four summer classes? Im actually not sure. But yeah you cannot take six I have asked!",

Also, what will the cost of attending classes be like, alongside financial aid like FAFSA once you take classes after your normal graduation time? I've heard some pretty worrying things about practically all of the financial aid getting removed and having to bear the full costs, which is pretty much a impossibility for me.",

The best way to find out is to call and ask how much everything would be. It's so annoying but it is the easiest way!",

            "comment": "you can only take five unfortunately! you can overload credits (for example, take 5 four credit courses, which would equal 20 credits, 2 above the max of 18) but you cant overload the number of classes (for example, you cant take 6 three credit courses, even if it equals 18 credits). i think its a little bizarre but there's no work around. best advice is take summer courses (i believe the limit is three?) and look into winter sessions separate from fordham. you'll have to get it approved but if you're looking to graduate early or get extra credits for a major/minor, its an option. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni know this because i applied for a credit overload and got denied by my advisor lol because of the 5 class limit",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not 100% sure if it\u2019s the same at RH but I think it is? Freshman and sophomores were allowed to take 18 credits max but are recommended to take 15 (so five three credit courses) but I think I\u2019ve seen people take six classes in a semester before. You might need permission from an advisor who will override the system for that though. Then, Juniors and seniors were capped at 16 credits and were recommended to take four 4 credit classes but were allowed to switch that up (so like taking two 4 credit courses and two 3 credit courses instead) as long as the credit number did not exceed 16. If you wanted to go above 16 as a junior or senior you needed to fill out a course overload form and get it approved and then your credit limit would be upped to 20. Depending on your reason for wanting to take extra credits you may or may not need to pay for them.\n\nBe careful with this though! I took extra courses almost every semester my junior and senior year but I didn\u2019t look closely at the work load for each of my classes. The semester that I took 20 credits was pretty chill. However, the next semester I took 18 credits and it was the worst semester of my life because while the credits were lower, some of my classes were way more demanding.",

            "comment": "Hi just responding here cause the previous answers are technically correct but not fully right. The course count is what\u2019s suggested but it actually operates on credit count. That\u2019s why the language on the Fordham website operates around \u201cstudents normally take x classes\u201d or \u201cstudents usually take x classes.\u201d It is because it is not based on class count but credit count.\n\nVia the Rose Hill page and academic policies:\n\nFreshman and Sophomores completing a B.A. degree have a credit ceiling of 20 credits. Freshman and Sophomores completing a B.S. degree have a credit limit of 21 credits. \n\nJuniors and Seniors pursuing a B.A. degree have a credit ceiling of 18 credits. Juniors and Seniors completing a B.S. degree have a credit ceiling of 20 credits, allowing them to register for up to 20 credits. \n\nThere is, like everyone was saying, the fifth course overload, but its just an overload because all upper level classes are 4 credits. As long as you are under the credit ceiling your fine. \n\nhttps://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/rose-hill/academic-policies-procedures/registration/\n\nVia the Lincoln Center Page (if you\u2019re LC):\nConfusing to read but the information is kind of there. The credit ceiling of 16 that 123 mentions in their response for LC is mentioned here as well. \nhttps://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/lincoln-center/academic-policies-procedures/registration/",

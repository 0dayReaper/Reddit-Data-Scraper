    "postText": "Hey all, I got admitted to Fordham Rose Hill yesterday. I am over the moon excited, but I am facing one issue: price. Although I was fortunate enough to receive a scholarship, the price is still quite a bit higher than I was expecting. However, I realized that I may be able to save money if I live off campus/dorm with someone. Where can I find safe off-campus housing that is close to the school? Any recommendations? Any and all advice would be appreciated. I am super excited and am IN LOVE with the school, now I just hope I can make it work in terms of pricing.",

            "comment": "I don't have experience with Fordham on the recommendation I am about to offer. You seem like a smart, polite, respectful and articulate person. Fordham would be lucky to have you represent them. \n\nFor that reason, don't be shy to reach out to them and ask if there is anything else they can do about the cost of attending. They will not revoke your admission for asking. The worst would be a polite 'sorry, there is nothing else'. Simply having the courage, humility and determination to ask for help can sometimes yield extraordinarily surprising results. They already demonstrated that they want you now see if they are willing to work for your attendance! ;-)\n\nGood luck and congrats on your admission!",

Especially if you make it known that the way the current price is, that's a deal breaker for acceptance. It's not guaranteed to give you extra aid, but it does happen quite often. \n\nSome other ways to reduce cost off the top of my head is by using your own healthcare insurance provider if you have it and it's eligible in NY. I think the cost of that is ~$2.5k that you can get rid of. In addition, the Block 250 meal plan, if they still offer it, gets you more than enough if you eat twice daily, has room for extra meals on top of that, and saves you $6-800 off of the unlimited plan they recommend. (insurance is billed yearly, meal plan semesterly as far as I'm aware)\n\nAs for off-campus housing/dorming, my understanding is that even if you have a couple of roommates, you're still looking at fairly similar prices to on campus dorms, but I have not looked too far into that so that might not be accurate.",

I would only add that if you are able to make it work, there may be options available once enrolled. I faced a similar situation (many, many moons ago) when I entered Fordham and was able to secure a need-based grant (named Grant-In-Aid? possibly) after my Freshman year. I camped out in the Financial Aid office and asked around to find out what programs were available in my situation.\n\nAdditionally, I was an RA my Junior and Senior years on campus. I hear it is more competitive now, but that was a game-changer for me as it trimmed the final financial tally for me tremendously. It is a full-time job in every sense of the word, but very rewarding.\n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "just have a question: why do i need to pay for things like meals and transportation if i\u2019m a commuter? on my college financing plan, right below tuition, it includes prices for meals and transportation. but i\u2019m not planning to eat the school\u2019s food or use their transportation (?) so i\u2019m not really sure why i need to pay it. sorry if this is a dumb question i\u2019m just a bit unsure",

They figure the average student pays around that a semester for food and transportation. They don\u2019t charge you ahead of time for transportation and don\u2019t force commuters be on the meal plan.",

If you are a commuter and don\u2019t want a meal plan you just email the financial aid people and ask. Often times the computer system puts something on your bill automatically and they can just take it off",

If you are a commuter the estimated transportation cost is considering an average of public transportation or what it would cost for gas and to maintain a car. They also add an average cost for meals assuming you will buy food, either on or off campus. It just means they are considering all average costs for students, even commuters.",

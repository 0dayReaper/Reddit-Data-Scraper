    "postText": "I never thought I'd get to such a low point, but here I am, in this subreddit, ranting about my life. \n\nI'm dreading the start of this semester so much. Being a freshman for the 2019-2020 school year and going back to in-person classes as a junior is completely psyching me out, and making me feel more alone than ever. I am at FCLC, and I am a commuter. I have never felt more alone in my life since I began college. \n\nFirstly, I burned bridges at the start before COVID-19 hit, and I would skip out on making friends or hanging out with people to commute back home and go to sleep. I constantly look back and hate myself for it. I watch as people have the time of their lives in New York City, spending on their parents credit card every night to be able to afford fancy brunch and dinner and envy them. I then envy the sheer fact that people can afford to dorm at Fordham, and can hardly stomach the fact that there are probably some people who can do it and do not even have loans taken out. \n\nThe parts of college that I have enjoyed thus far (aka certain club experiences and classes) are always overshadowed by this cloud hovering above me of regret, shame, and fear. Regret of choosing to go to an institution where the majority went to private high school, have rich parents, and are extremely extroverted. Regret of my introverted-ness ruining my chances at making core friendships at the beginning of my college experience. Regret of having to being in debt for most of my life because I wanted to prove I was good enough by going to a well-known, expensive institution, rather than choosing a school because I actually loved it. Shame, because I compare myself to everyone and feel inferior. Fear, because I can't see it getting better, and I have four more semesters until I can look back and either say it was the worst time of my life or the best. \n\nI close my eyes and envision all of this as my fault, because it is. I'm in a situation where I don't want to transfer because of how my parents would look at me, and I've already made it this far. I just don't know what to do at this point, and sometimes I feel horrible for judging almost everyone around me for the better-ness of their lives because I'm miserable. I just wish I could relate to everyone around me, but in my experience I've just dealt with so many clique-y individuals who turn their heads and give off a holier-than-thou attitude. I have a few friends who are practically all commuters, but so much of me longs for the perfect \"I'm friends with everyone\" type college experience I see everyone else in the entire world, and everyone else at FCLC, go through. It's always felt impossible as a commuter, and I'm not sure why I ever thought I would have that experience.\n\nI am sorry that everyone has to read this 4 AM rant, but I am hoping that somehow this semester I can muster the courage to make a change for myself, be more outgoing, and actually figure out how to feel like I am actually apart of Fordham rather than ostracized. Maybe what I need is words of reassurance, or even just recognition from people who have maybe felt the same way at some point in their Fordham career. This negative attitude weighs me down constantly, and is slowly making me sink as the school year approaches. But a tiny part of me is holding out hope.",

You know you want to find an understanding group of friends? Start by making one friend. I'm sure there's one person in your mind right now as the most promising candidate. Approach them and just say Hello, and ask them how their summer was. You can do it. Don't worry about rich/poor, commuter/on-campus - just be authentic.",

Fordham is a wonderful institution and has some amazing advantages; you just gotta use your resources wisely. you deserve to be here and it\u2019s no mistake. \n\ni\u2019m also a rising junior so i know how it feels to feel like everything\u2019s ending too soon but you feel like you haven\u2019t done enough. what helped me that could help you is making a list of very SPECIFIC goals that\u2019ll help you meet your social and academic goals. maybe instead of \u201cmake new friends\u201d, the goal can be \u201cinitiate convo with at least 1 person every week and try to make plans with them.\u201d you can do this for other stuff too! just make sure not to cross your own limits (and know them too).\n\nas things return to in person and hopefully stay in person, these things might come easier face to face than over a screen. \n\nmaybe using Fordham\u2019s counseling services would also benefit you if these negative thoughts are constantly weighing you down and keeping you up. it\u2019s free and confidential!\n\nyou\u2019re gonna do great. you\u2019re free to PM if you have any questions and whatnot :))",

            "comment": "Hey dude I'm literally in the exact same boat as you. I'm a rising junior as well and realized just how incredibly alone I've felt. I'm just more of a social introvert and have tended to shy away from hanging out with large groups of people. Generally, I've tended to enjoy spending more time alone or with my girlfriend of one year than with any other people, and it led me to never put in the effort to really make any friends at LC. But now that we've broken up I've realized I literally have almost no one at LC that I feel I can hang or chill out with and it's definitely taken a toll on my mental health recently. I know exactly what you mean when you say you kinda hate yourself for just wanting to go back home and chill out by yourself than going out and trying to make friends because that's exactly what I've always done.\n\nOne thing I will say though is that I would not envy anyone at Fordham just because they can afford more things than you. I'll be frank and just tell you that my financial situation allows me to live on (well, very near) campus and go out to the occasional fancy shmancy lunch/dinner, but that really has not helped me much at all. There's a saying that some people are so poor that all they have is money, because I can guarantee you that's ultimatly not what matters. I just have to be more willing to put in the effort to legitimately socialize and that sounds like something both of us will probably have to do. \n\nI would start by joining a few clubs that interest you, that's one of my goals. One of my regrets actually is not doing that earlier as I've heard that's how a lot of people have made their friends at LC. Fuck it dude you can start with me, shoot me a PM and maybe we can meet up somewhere or join a club together.",

But that means you just have to get creative lol. \n\nAnyway I would reach out a hand to you, but I don't want to expose myself on my main account lol. Just put yourself out there next sem and don't be scared to make the first move. My go-to is compliments bc people love receiving them.",

It is so easy to feel alienated if you do not fit the WASP category. I noticed this at another college too. If you are not from a big city, rich, white, etc. it is extremely hard to find any sort of common ground. I have this problem myself since I am from a rural area, the manners and customs are shockingly different.\n\nAlso not having time because you have to work to survive. That sucks so much. It is so much more stressful and makes it harder to even want to go out with friends. Having to work full time and school full time is extremely draining, but some kids don't have to deal with that. It's insane!\n\nSo, basically, I'm going through the same thing and dreading it as well, but it is a lot easier to make friends outside of uni.",

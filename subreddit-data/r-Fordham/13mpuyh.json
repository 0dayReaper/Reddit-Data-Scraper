Also did the sleep study thing where at the end I got $81 twice.\n\nIn September they were giving out free Rolling Loud tickets but that was pretty much NYC-school-wide. There\u2019s always pizza, donuts, drinks in the plaza at LC",

You might be able to just walk up and show your student ID like you do at the Botans but I\u2019ve never tried. It gives you the basic ticket and you have to pay for any of the \u201cStar attractions\u201d but you can pay as you wish with those",

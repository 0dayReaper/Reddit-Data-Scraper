            "comment": "If you have bags, the best way, imho is to take the BX-12 SBS one stop from the metro north gate to the D train station  (saves the walk up the hill and cuts travel time), then take the D toward Manhattan to 59 St - Columbus Circle. Hop off, and wait on the same platform for a downtown A train (no walking for this transfer, which makes it so great with bags). Then take the A to 34 St - Penn Station, and you're there!",

Or you could take the D train from Fordham Road to 34th St- Herald Square and then walk to Penn Station from there. It should take like 5 mins :)",

    "postText": "Hi, i\u2019m a Hunter college student, and I was looking to transfer for the fall(i did the accelerated transfer contract because I had gotten in to fordham before, if that\u2019s important). Due to a bunch of stuff going on with my schools office and such, a bunch of my documents got to the school late, but I was assured that it was ok. I submitted all of my documents by around the 24th of June, and it says on the website that I was supposed to hear back 10-15 days later, and it\u2019s been quite a bit longer. I got an email a couple of days ago saying my contract JUST WENT THROUGH, which kind of scares me because it has gone through over a month ago. Was I accepted or denied? Should I call someone at admissions or email an advisor? Would they be able to help me?",

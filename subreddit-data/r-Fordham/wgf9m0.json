    "postText": "Hi I have just been accepted to rose hill as a transfer. However it is already August so it is pretty late and I do not have enough time to make that move so I would like to know if it is possible to have my admission deferred to the spring so that I may have enough time to get things sorted.",

I practically just got my schedule completed and still am sorting out medical forms etc. \n\nYou can definitely defer but don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s an uphill battle if you actually want to attend this fall. Many core classes still open.",

However for me to defer till the spring do I have to accept the offer of admission first and then contact the school or do I have just email them first?",

If you\u2019re not near to your acceptance deadline you can always wait and speak to the dean\u2019s office just to be sure about timeline etc. I\u2019m uncertain if they allow you to specify when you intend to enroll on the accept admission page. Either way you should be fine, just mind the the deadline! And congratulations on Fordham! It\u2019s wonderful school! I\u2019ll be attending this fall as a transfer. Feel free to message me, happy to connect.",

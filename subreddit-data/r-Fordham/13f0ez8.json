            "comment": "The consulting cup challenge has to be the dumbest shit on the face of earth. Biggest dickhead move on the part of fordham because it absolutely fucks over commuters. They give you a basket of classes that you MUST select from and if you don\u2019t get your first choice the rest are absolutely horrible. One class will be at 7 am the next will be at 5 pm and the next will be at 8 at night. The worst shit possible for commuters who have to juggle ECs, jobs, etc. The career exploration class is useless and provides no real value. The dean of lincoln center gabelli forces students to take WELL over 12 credits even though they can fulfill requirements through AP credits or dual enrollments from high school. I had to take 17 credits my freshman 2nd semester even though I had credit for Calc and stats, and was still scheduled for 14 credits before he forced me to take philosophy which added it up to 17 credits which absolutely drained the shit out of me.",

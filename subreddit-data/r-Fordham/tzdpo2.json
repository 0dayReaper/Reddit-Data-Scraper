I\u2019m also still on the fence about which campus to apply for (RH or LC) so any advice about that would be appreciated :)",

            "comment": "For the campus, I'd say it depends on your major. For example, if you're gonna major in anything business-related you'll have to apply for RH, but for Global Business you'll go to LC. I suggest you do some research. \n\nBut if your major is offered at both campus, APPLY FOR LC you'll hate it here at the Bronx. Everyone hates the Bronx and they just hang out in the city anw so if you stay at LC you'll save yourself a lot of time commuting (it takes around 1 hour to the Manhattan from the Bronx with subway). Also the student body at LC is so much more diverse and everyone's so cool imo, while in RH they're just cliquey. But LC doesn't have a traditional campus so it feels more like a place to come and go, but at RH there are plenty of places to hang out on campus. Choose wisely cause if you don't like the campus you apply for you'll have to get a 3.7 GPA to even be considered for a campus transfer.",

Uses genre/class/valence/song/weather/chorus/bridge and other factors.\n\nRecommends new music in 10-20-second snippets to help you discover new music faster in a Tik Tok-like feed. Would love criticism :)\n\nI also made a waitlist for it, has roughly 1100 people on it so far for the iOS app if you'd like to try it out when it is out:[https://forms.gle/W7BxeY1s39andTPB7](https://forms.gle/W7BxeY1s39andTPB7)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rl15tkwtnm591.png?width=1175&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a8d9f0e5d64062700343f91ae6d1c99103bfae38",

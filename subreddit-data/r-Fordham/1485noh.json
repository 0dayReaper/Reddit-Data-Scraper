    "postText": "Which school do you guys think is better for psychology? Fordham is more prestigious, but I also loved the different psychology classes that Pace offers. Also, I think Pace has more opportunities for internships. And, I want to transfer to NYU after a year. Which school is easier to transfer from to NYU? Please help me, because I am so confused and had no idea.",

            "comment": "Fair warning (and I might be wrong, so ask around): psychology is one of those degrees that if you want to work in that subject area, you\u2019re probably going to need a graduate degree after the bachelors. You can do other things with the bachelors (business, etc), but something directly in psychology is going to want more.\nSo, that being said, think about which school is cheaper. Fordham is more prestigious and seems to have a pretty good psychology program, but Pace is a nice school. I\u2019ve been to their Manhattan and Westchester campuses and thought they were both pretty good and the staff I met were all friendly.",

That costs money too.\n\nSo if you're looking for a job actually in psychology? Pace, I'm sure it's cheaper. But if you plan on using the paych degree in a not purely psychology job? Fordham. Great program my friends in the department all enjoyed.",

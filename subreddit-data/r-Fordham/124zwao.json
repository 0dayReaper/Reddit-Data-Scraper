    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a prospective student deciding between Fordham RH and UVA. I\u2019m not sure what I want to major in yet, and want to have options coming into college. Originally I was thinking psychology, but I\u2019ve also thought about more STEM majors like engineering. I know UVA is really strong in these departments but I don\u2019t know much about Fordham\u2019s STEM programs. Would I be getting a good education as a STEM major in Fordham? Or more generally, is Fordham a good place to go Undecided?",

            "comment": "Fordham doesn\u2019t have engineering. They have an Engineering Physics program which is a physics-heavy degree to prepare you for further studies in engineering, but it\u2019s not really a traditional engineering degree.\n\nThey have a 3+2 program with Columbia so you can get a BA/BS from Fordham and a BS from Columbia in engineering. I tried to do that back in the day but wasn\u2019t keen about paying for an extra year of school. \n\nI did Computer Science (FCLC \u201810) and the program is solid and rigorous enough. They have a data mining lab and the CS professors are well-regarded. I\u2019ve heard good things about the biology program too. \n\nUVA has a full engineering school, so there\u2019s really no comparison for that. UVA is way bigger and has a bigger endowment, and probably has more opportunities for STEM research.\n\nObviously UVA is the place to go if you want to do cutting-edge scientific research as an undergrad, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t get a good scientific education at Fordham either. \n\nBoth are good schools.",

The huge difference is that you\u2019ll have more resources at a place like UVA. There will be more research opportunities, newer lab spaces, etc.",

    "postText": "Hi I had a question about the pre-health track requirements. I noticed that on the website [pre health requirements](https://www.fordham.edu/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/academics/pre-professional-programs/pre-health/curriculum-and-coursework/) there is a minimum requirement and then a required requirements part. Is it possible to just take the minimum requirements only. I know most med schools want you to take a statistics and psychology class but haven\u2019t seen any require biochemistry.",

You have to take an EMT course in order to join, which Fordham pays for but is on your own time.\n\nThere are a ton of non-clinical volunteer opportunities. Just Google them and see what you\u2019re interested in.\n\nFordham is not affiliated with any hospital for shadowing. You can hand out \u201cpatient wellness surveys\u201d at St. Barnabas, but that experience is not very popular because you don\u2019t see any patient care and you have to devote a pretty significant amount of time to it.",

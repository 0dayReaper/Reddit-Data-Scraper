Is there a way to report it to Fordham or an someone by email I can inform of this? \n\nIt may seem minimal but it\u2019s a really important and serious topic that there is already a lot of misinformation about, and a committee that markets themselves as educational should do better research because it\u2019s also personal to many people and may make them feel invalidated.",

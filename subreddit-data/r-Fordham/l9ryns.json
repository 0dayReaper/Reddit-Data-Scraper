All of my pots and pans and cooking supplies are gone. My clothing I left is gone. Bedding is gone. Everything else in my dorm is gone. \n\nI\u2019ve finished talking with the RA and filed a report but I have no idea if or when I\u2019m getting my stuff back. I can\u2019t cook, do my laundry, or clean without purchasing all new stuff or going back home to get more things. \n\nI\u2019m just frustrated right now. Maybe I should just go home.",

Assuming you had the room reserved for the entire year and not just the semester, this was a huge huge mistake on reslife\u2019s part. Don\u2019t listen to them when they say go to public safety, they are 100% at fault. Demand them to compensate you and give you answers as to what happened.\n\nAll your stuff is gone and probably donated to the nearby donation center, which is what they usually do when people leave stuff after moving out. I mean they probably actually throw it away but point is your stuff is gone and reslife is at fault.",

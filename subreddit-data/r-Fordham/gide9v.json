It has killer mexican food, which is also very inexpensive, and unless things have changed they tend not to ID and if you're a fordham student you get a dollar off beer. Good place to become a regular early on and to eat out at when you're trying to make money stretch. Get the al pastor.",

When I was a freshman I spent my 2ams at The Flame Diner with pals, often after a) a night of studying, b) a night of drinking, or c) all of the above. Alan\u2019s Deli across the street from LC is also a fan favorite. Can\u2019t forget about Magnolia (and their banana pudding) or Joe &amp; The Juice (expensive but worth the splurge once in a while) for hot &amp; cold drinks, respectively. Joe Coffee is a great alternative to Starbucks &amp; Dunkin. I can\u2019t help you out on bars, because I always stayed in when I drank, but I\u2019m told that women can often get away with buying beer/wine from Alan\u2019s at night without getting carded.\n\nBut I\u2019d be doing a disservice if I didn\u2019t recommend you go far, far away from Fordham to experience the best of NYC. Go to cafes and museums in the Village and LES, go to Brooklyn (in but also BEYOND Williamsburg pls) to go to bars and restaurants, and Jackson Heights in Queens has great food (it\u2019s the most diverse neighborhood in America!).\n\nAnd make sure you find some spots that also have live music. Rockwood Music Hall, Bowery Electric, The Nest, and Arlene\u2019s Grocery are some of my faves (though Arlene\u2019s scans your cards, so be careful).\n\nSorry for the ramble, but I hope this helps!\n\nEdit: Fuck, how could I forget Justino\u2019s Pizza, NY Fresh Pizza, or Fluffy\u2019s Cafe? Not to mention Burrito Box! I am a fake Ram!",

            "comment": "Here we go: (Rose Hill!)\n\nBars (you don't need an ID): Mugz (best in my opinion but I'm biased) smaller sports bar, usually no cover, Suits is the best and gives free alcohol sometimes, drink ups twice a week at least (open bar for $5/$10/$15), jukebox and fun environment with friends, and order a woo woo or buy a pitcher of beer. Howl is cool, usually pay cover, big space, and much danicer environment. Big tequila shot type of place. Barnyard is the biggest and newest, lot of freshmen, and much more hookup type environment. You'll be paying cover but it's huge and outside area and also fun environment.\n\nAlcohol: Churrys doesn't card and Churry is so sweet but it's more expensive. The Liquor Store (that's literally the name) on Fordham Road sometimes cards, average price. North End near Walgreens is the best price but they card the most often. Also biggest selection/closest to freshmen dorms. Rams is the go-to for any beer/seltzer/tallboy type of alcohol, they never card.\n\nFood: You can't go wrong anywhere off-campus, all so good. Tinos is a personal Italian favorite and is cheaper than other Italian places on Arthur Ave. If your parents are visiting or going for a nice place, Michaelangelos or Zero Otto Nove, but all are fantastic. Estrellitas for Mexican, especially for the Sangria. Rams and Best for bodega food and awesome sandwiches, Pugsley's for pizza OR hot take, Ram's pizza is pretty fire.  \n\nShopping: TJ MAXX &lt;3 but definitely check out Fordham Road clothing stores, I've found some of my favorite clothes from these stores and usually for cheap!\n\nGo to the Botanical Gardens, the Bronx Zoo, it's free to students and definitely take advantage! Also the Ram Van to Columbus Circle to explore Manhattan!",

If you\u2019re a fan of chai lattes take a walk a block past the Starbucks and go down to Birch. Idk what it is about their chai latte, but it\u2019s really good. If you\u2019re going on a date or are just feeling a good dinner, check out Sambas kitchen on 9th ave and 46th st. Their bife Samba and their bife a Portuguesa is amazingly tasty and pretty affordable. If you\u2019re old enough or wanna risk it, I recommend a Caipirinha. Just make sure to take some time to explore the city and you\u2019ll have a great time",

            "comment": "Sure I'll play the hits: \n\n* Italian: Roberto's and Mario's are my go to Arthur Ave. recs. Mario's has been there for more than a hundred years, and has probably the best vodka sauce I've ever tasted. Zero Otto Nove also has some great woodfired pizzas, and Fiasco is sneaky good. Avoid Gerbasi, Ann &amp; Tony's.\n* Pizza: You honestly can't graduate without going to Puglsey's, and if you do, I'll question if you truly went to Fordham. Full Moon is the classic recommendation, but don't sleep on Tony &amp; Tina's on the corner of Arthur and 189th. This might be a hot take, but I generally try to avoid University. It's just unexceptional pizza.\n* Sandwiches: Go to Mike's Deli in the Terminal Market. David Greco is a big Fordham supporter (as was his late father Mike), very, very amiable to his repeat customers, and is a community stalwart. In a pinch, I am a Ram's Deli Plus loyalist through and through. Plus, like other friendly neighborhood establishments, they're *accomodating* of Fordham students looking to drink, if you're a familiar face and not a troublemaker. \n* I'll second the endorsement for Cuchifrito's by the 4 train, and the aforementioned pho spot near Kingsbridge. Big fan of both if you've got time to wander.",

Way more sit down options and great burgers. \n\nIn terms of Italian food Enzos/Michaelangelos are really popular but I love Emilio\u2019s as much if not more. Also Simons deli is criminally slept on for its bagels. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to the liquor store Churry\u2019s is cheaper than the Liquor Store and is more lenient about carding. Plus the owner is way nicer. Definitely worth a block longer walk.",

            "comment": "Your cohort experience will be entirely made by the work ethic of the people you are grouped with. If they do their part, you will have no issues. If they don\u2019t, you\u2019re in for a wild ride. Try to establish firm agreements about when different stages of work will be done, e.g. \u201chave first drafts for your part of the paper in 3 days before the deadline, everyone look it over and edit by  6 hours before the deadline, then John will submit it.\u201d Meet fairly often \u2014 not necessarily for a long time, but just to ensure you\u2019re on the same page. On the flip side, all that goes for you too \u2014 don\u2019t let your teammates down, they *will* resent you for making their semester living hell if you\u2019re not pulling your weight.\n\nTo your question about work, it\u2019s not so much work where you can\u2019t keep a campus/part-time job. I honestly feel like I have more work junior year, but that could just be finals stress. I think that rule is mainly meant to prevent against people taking full time internships/jobs alongside their coursework; if you\u2019re putting 20hrs or less a week in to your job you should be fine. Try and get scheduled for your job around times you predict your group may meet though, that will save a lot of scheduling conflicts",

I was on a team with 4 strangers all of whom who had very different backgrounds, work ethics, and priorities. I agree with the first comment about setting clear expectations and boundaries with your team. My team and I agreed that we would meet once a week on a weekday and that we wouldn't meet on weekends. Definitely make a groupchat and use it often, and don't be afraid to hold people accountable for their assignments and portion of the work. If someone is slacking, don't be afraid to call them out by name in a respectful way.",

    "postText": "I have a 3.51/4 Weighted GPA\nFootball all 4 years of high school\nVolunteered at football camp grade 11-12\nHeld a job as a cashier grades 11-12\n(1220 SAT but I applied test optional)\n\nTook/taking 8 Honors and 2 AP classes (bio and Econ, Currently taking both and doing great in Econ but a 77 in Ap bio for Semester 1)\n\nOne thing that I think is a positive about my transcript is that my GPA went up each year. (3.23 freshman, 3.42 Sophomore, 3.6 6Junior, 3.87 semester 1 senior)\n\nI applied on New Years and still haven\u2019t received a decision yet. They sent an email a week ago saying they began reviewing my application. I\u2019m hoping they see my semester one grades because I\u2019m having a good senior year grades wise, and I think it will be the factor on whether I get accepted or not.\n\nI\u2019m a Filipino American btw but that probably doesn\u2019t matter :P\n\nPlease let me know what you guys thoughts are!",

    "postText": "In an email to the University today, Fr. McShane sent the following:\n\n\"Until yesterday, the governor\u2019s office continued to enforce a limit of 150 people per graduation ceremony, severely limiting our ability to invite guests. As you may have seen, new guidance was issued by the governor\u2019s office on April 12, 2021.\n \nGiven these changes, I am pleased to announce that each graduate will be able to invite two guests to the school ceremonies. \n \nWe have been preparing for the possibility of guests. For our undergraduate students, we will be hosting a series of school ceremonies to accommodate both graduating seniors and their two guests. Unfortunately, due to space restrictions, we will not be able to release any additional tickets. Per New York state requirements, all attendees, including students, will be required to:\n \n* show proof of a completed COVID-19 vaccination series or a negative COVID-19 PCR test received within 72 hours of the ceremony;\n* complete a health screening questionnaire;\n* observe social distancing;\n* and wear face masks at all times. \n\nThe ceremonies at which graduates will walk across the stage and be individually recognized, will take place from Monday, May 17, to Thursday, May 20, and will be livestreamed so that additional family members and friends can join in the ceremony virtually.\n \nAs originally planned, the main University Commencement ceremony will still be conducted virtually on Saturday, May 22, at 10 a.m. eastern time.\"",

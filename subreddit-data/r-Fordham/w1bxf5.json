    "postText": "I waived the health insurance fairly late and the insurance charge is still on my bill, which is due very soon. It seems it's not coming off before the deadline. If I pay it now, will I get refunded the money I paid for the insurance after the waiver processes? I feel like I should but I'd like to know if anyone had this happen before.",

My mom was once told my someone in financial ail that so many people call or email about things the offices don\u2019t control. They have to put so many staff to answer phone calls and to answer emails then they don\u2019t have the staff working to do the refunds and making the changes to update the bills.  If we have to send the waiver info to the insurance company how will student accounts know?  They probably remove the insurance charge once the insurance company tells them.  People can subtract the amount of the insurance if they processed the waiver.  For those that didn\u2019t do the waivers the charge will never come off.",

They go directly to the health insurance company. Student Accounts doesn\u2019t know who has a waiver until the health insurance company lets them know. Maybe they only do notifications to Student Accounts once in a while. I think it was stated somewhere if you provided the waiver you can just subtract it from what you owe.  \n\nJust make sure you really do the waiver.  I think the deadline is the end of August or in September.",

    "postText": "I come from a high school that doesn\u2019t offer AP classes, only dual enrollment classes taken through Syracuse University. The program is called SUPA and we have teachers that are trained in it to teach us from our own high school the same curriculum that Syracuse teaches. I just found out that apparently we needed to be taught on campus of the university to get our credits to transfer to Fordham, but it looks like Fordham takes AP credits. For anyone that has had this problem were you able to get your credits to transfer? I don\u2019t want to have to retake all these classes I took so I could save money. I don\u2019t get why if they take AP they wouldn\u2019t take dual enrollment courses.",

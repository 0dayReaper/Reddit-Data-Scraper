Keeping kosher is important to me but it doesn\u2019t seem like Fordham has any kosher meal plans. If you know anyone who keeps kosher at Fordham, how do they manage?",

I\u2019ve been at events too where they give free food and there always separate boxes for halal and kosher eaters.\n\nhttp://fordham.campusdish.com/en/mealplansall/",

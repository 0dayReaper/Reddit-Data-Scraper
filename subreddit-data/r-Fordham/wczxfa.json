I had Monday\u2019s and Thursday\u2019s that were packed my first semester with a morning that started  at rose hill and ended at Lincoln center (at 9pm lol) and then I had to head back on the ram van but tbh it was kinda fun and as long as you plan your meals you\u2019ll feel energized and fine!",

That\u2019s gonna heavily affect your ability to perform well with this schedule, but with discipline it\u2019s possible. \n\nRegardless, Wednesday will inevitably become the day for you to catch up on readings/ work on heavy assignments for future days. You have some good gaps the other days to have lunch/ go to fun club activities/ work on light assignments/ sprinkle in work-study if you are eligible.",

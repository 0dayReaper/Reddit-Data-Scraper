    "postText": "Hello all, I am a Fordham instructor and definitely **NOT** Fr. McShane. \n\nWe JUST TODAY were asked about our preferences. We have been instructed to give an answer by July 30th. \n\nHere are some excerpts from the Dean's email to faculty:   \n\n\n&gt;**The three Flexible Hybrid modality options for fall 2020 are**:   \n&gt;  \n&gt;(a) **Fully online**, with both synchronous and asynchronous elements in an online format. Please note that if you choose to teach fully online you relinquish your assigned classroom;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(b) **Hybrid**, with synchronous in-person components and asynchronous elements in an online format (see further explanation of hybrid options below);  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(c) **Fully in-person**, as may be appropriate for science labs, performance-based courses, or other courses that may call for in-person instruction.  \n   \n&gt;  \n&gt;**For option \u201c(b) hybrid\u201d and \u201c(c) fully in person\u201d:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Option \u201c(b) hybrid\u201d is the most capacious category, capable of many variations. The synchronous components may be all in-person but they may also include a mix of in-person and online formats (such as Zoom meetings). Individual faculty have the freedom to determine how this mix of in-person and online formats is allocated. The difference between \u201c(a) fully online\u201d and \u201c(b) hybrid\u201d is that (b) includes in-person components and (a) does not.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Those of you who teach in modalities (b) or (c) may consider teaching online in the first week or two of the semester, to accommodate students in quarantine (following arrival  to campus from quarantine states) and students who are changing their schedules.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Your ability to deliver courses in a hybrid or in-person modality may change at a later point, due to shifts in the public health situation or your personal circumstances. The deans will develop a mechanism for recording such adjustments.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- All courses will be online in the period after Thanksgiving and through finals; please plan your syllabi accordingly.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Classroom capacity will be, for most rooms, at 30-40% occupancy. This means that most courses will need to segment their student groups into smaller ones (typically, into at least 2-3 groups). However, segmentation does not mean that you have to spend 2-3 times as long in synchronous sessions. Rather, while each student in a segmented class would experience less synchronous time, the instructor would teach synchronously for the same amount of time as in a regular course.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- When synchronous contact time with students is more limited than it normally would be, the instructor should ensure that the combination of the synchronous (online or in-person) and asynchronous engagement together approximate typical contact hours. Additional guidance will be forthcoming from the FAS Flexible Hybrid Transition Team shortly\n\nHope this info helps and adds clarity. For what it's worth I plan on choosing (b) to allow flexibility.",

The worst part about all this is I strongly suspect that whatever plans are made, they will be pitched when infections tick upwards. All these plans that all colleges are making (not just Fordham) are sandcastles and the tide is coming in.... everyone buckle up.",

Costs too much to move back just to leave quickly anyways. I\u2019d rather have a fully online fall semester and a good spring semester than a half-ass fall semester and half-ass spring semester.",

The fact that Fordham has yet to provide an asynchronous option just goes to show how little they care to accommodate Intl Students (who tend to pay high tuition at full cost)",

While there will be asynchronous eleme ts in most (if not all) courses, the university does expect instructors to have synchronous elements to help facilitate \"community.\" That and some courses, like those in the humanities, require more \"discussions.\" \n\nFor what it's worth, I myself am prepared to shift the online \"synchronous\" aspects to different times in order to accommodate any international students who can't return to campus. But there's no guarantee any other faculty member will do this.",

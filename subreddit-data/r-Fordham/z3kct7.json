    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am going to be in the city for summer 2023 and am currently looking for housing early since I know how high in demand it will be. I know it is very early but I am looking for a studio for my boyfriend and I (he is also going to be in the city for the summer). \n\nIf you know you will be subletting your apartment for the summer please let me know! I am preferably looking for somewhere in midtown, \u201cupper\u201d downtown (i.e. grammercy) and \u201clower\u201d upper east side. We both will be working in the heart of midtown so I do not want commute to be too far. \n\nWe are both very neat and don\u2019t intend to throw any parties of any sort throughout the summer.",

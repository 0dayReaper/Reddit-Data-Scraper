    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI just got accepted to Fordham for the Spring Semester as a transfer student. I did not get offered any housing, and am wondering what I should do. Fordham is my #1 choice and I would love to go, but the housing situation makes me uneasy. I live between 40 minutes-1 hour away from Fordham over the border in CT, so commuting is not an unreasonable option. I am also interested in looking at nearby apartments to see if I can rent. What do you guys think I should do? How easy is it to get an apartment nearby campus?",

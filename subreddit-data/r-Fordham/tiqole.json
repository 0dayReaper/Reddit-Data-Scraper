If you received a scholarship they usually say what percent of the class they are reserved for, which can tell you if you\u2019re in the top 15%. Otherwise, I\u2019d probably guess based on something arbitrary like SAT scores, which have the 25% and 75% online. There have been studies that show econ, math, stem, and similar are lower gpa majors. If you\u2019re one of those, I\u2019d guess that even less than 15% of that major have above a 3.8 GPA. I think this is some evidence of grade deflation, but I have no idea what sort of national averages there are.\n\nNote that this statistic doesn\u2019t say if it includes Gabelli or not, and Gabelli has plenty of inflation",

This could reasonably explain the diff between Georgetown's ~3.45 avg and Fordham's 3.2. \n\nGuess my point here is tht we can't conclude much abt deflation or inflation solely on avg gpa. The fact that the majority of students at LC are students majoring in humanities/general lib arts is telling. I have taken multiple higher-lvl lib art classes for gen ed and can confidently say tht there's no way the avg person trying their best would remain at a 3.2. Idk if ur a Fordham student but I think any Fordham student at LC would assume tht someone w a 3.2 has that gpa because they kinda just don't try all that hard. \n\nV open to other opinions just wanted to get my last one out haha",

They are more than happy to help you as long as you show interest and put in effort.\n\nUtilize tutoring services. Study with peers.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t recommend this- if you\u2019re really behind in classes and know an upcoming assignment won\u2019t really affect your overall grade. Then focus on whatever class is more important in that moment.",

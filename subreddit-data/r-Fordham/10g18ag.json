    "postText": "I applied as a transfer student to LC. Starting to get worried about being accepted. I have a 3.9 college GPA from my first two semesters at a small state school. I didn\u2019t submit my SAT scores. I am interested in religious studies and have some solid work experience with my church, hoping this is a boost. \nWhat do you think my chances of admission are?",

In my past experience, I transferred twice so Fordham is my third uni but I find that transfers always have higher chances of getting in than regular admissions due to a smaller pool of people applying and being your competition. I can't really speak on the LC side of things but best of luck!",

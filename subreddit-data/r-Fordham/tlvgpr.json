Can someone explain these halls to me?\n\nOn the Fordham website, \"Campbell Hall, Salice and Conley Halls apartments include full living rooms\", and have [this picture of a den](https://www.fordham.edu/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/CSC_1_Edited_TJM.jpg), and [this picture of a kitchen](https://www.fordham.edu/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/CSC_2_Edited_TJM.jpg). These are nice as hell.\n\nBut then on this website, [here's a virtual tour of a five singles apartment](https://www.tours.vividmediany.com/3d-model/fordham-5-singles/fullscreen/). This doesn't look like the Fordham website pics at all.\n\nWhat's going on here? Can someone please explain these two very different-looking apartments to me?",

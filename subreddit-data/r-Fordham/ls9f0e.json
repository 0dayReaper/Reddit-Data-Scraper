    "postText": "With the UK variant on campus, I just don't see the point of being here anymore. All my classes are online, so I'm basically paying to stay in a drafty dorm room all day waiting for the vaccine. As a bonus, a girl in my hall tested positive.\n\nI don't mean to be a doomer or anything, but this is getting exhausting. I read in the Times that although cases have been going down worldwide, it's starting to level off due to the new variants. I just want to get off campus before the inevitable mass-exodus of students.",

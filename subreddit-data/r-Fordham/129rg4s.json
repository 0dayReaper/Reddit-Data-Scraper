    "postText": "hi guys, I\u2019m an incoming freshman planning to double major in environmental studies and music, and I wanted to know a little more about the music curriculum. \n\nAs of now in high school, I study voice and I would really like to continue but as far as I know, Fordham doesn\u2019t have a vocal program. I know there are choirs and stuff to join, but how are the performance opportunities in the music program in general? is it fulfilling? are there good connections? I really love music, especially the performance aspect, and I really want it to be a part of my college life. I\u2019d also like to learn instruments so if the music curriculum is more instrumental, I\u2019d be fine with that. Or is it more of just history and theory? I also saw that there are private music lessons, but they\u2019re pretty expensive so I\u2019m not sure about it.\n\nThank you so much!",

            "comment": "I just declared my music major this week! While I\u2019m still in the early steps of earning my degree, I will agree that Fordham\u2019s music major is more academically oriented. This is a BA in music, not a BM. Bachelor of Arts means you\u2019re getting a liberal arts education with a concentration in music, BM is a bachelor of Music and the concentration is even more specific in the field of music. As for the courses, you have Theory 1-3, Intro to Music History, 4 Performance Ensembles and a bunch of electives/upper level courses. Should be 10 classes in total. \n\nSo if you want a great well rounded Jesuit education and would like to leave your door open for music perhaps being part of your career, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth committing to. However, the program alone probably won\u2019t make you a tip-top performer, as this isn\u2019t a performance degree, that\u2019s up to you and your own grit. \n\nI\u2019m currently in one of the choirs, Jazz ensemble/combo and big band, pep band, and private lessons. Also, I\u2019m taking an Intro to Jazz Improvisation class, and it\u2019s one of the classes that is more performance oriented and is definitely challenging. Most of your classes will be history or theory related so definitely take advantage of performance classes when they pop up in the cycle. Different classes open each year; not all the courses on the website are offered every year, so keep your eyes peeled for courses that pique your interest.\n\nOn a side note, since you like vocals, our voice teachers in private lessons are wonderful. My lesson teacher right now is probably the sweetest and encouraging music teacher I\u2019ve had, and you\u2019ll definitely want to start building connections with them and the tenured faculty so you can score some broader networking. Best of luck! Let me know if you have any more questions!",

If you\u2019re looking to pursue a performance career with a top-notch ensemble, you might need to be a bit more competitive, but if you want to explore more academic sectors of music like education/pedagogy, music therapy, or even music administration/business then I think you\u2019d be comfy in this program, especially with the vast amount of knowledge and connections you will gain in other classes!",

            "comment": "Fordham's music program is academic, focused of history and theory rather than performance based. However you woll need 4 semesters of performance through one of the choirs or an instrumental ensemble. The Fordham Choir is very good, but most of the musical development you get is self-directed. The women's choir is not as technically challenging, but they have a lot of fun. \n\nThere are also a handful of a cappella groups, the liturgical choir (they sing at mass every Sunday at Rose Hill), and opportunities around NYC to sing and perform.",

Not that it hasn't been done, it's just not the strength or point of the school/music program. Music majors seem more prepared to be educators or folks on the business side. \n\nIf you're looking for a very good liberal arts education with available opportunities to engage in the arts and music industry then Fordham is a lot more your speed.  The University choir is a lot of fun to sing with (performed at Carnagie hall with them and a couple of countries on trips) but I only know 1 person of the 100+ I sang with there who has gone on to pursue music professionally after college and he's a bit of a starving artist. Internships are pretty plentiful in NYC too so there should be options to intern on the business side of the music industry.",

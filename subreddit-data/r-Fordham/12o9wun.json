    "postText": "Considering the two different dorms at Lincoln Center for freshman year. I've got food allergies and other concerns about eating in the cafeteria. If I live in McKeon I would be most likely to use meal exchanges. I'd prefer doing my own cooking with a kitchenette in McMahon but am worried about missing out on freshman activities and the freshman experience if I don't live in McKeon freshman year.Advice?",

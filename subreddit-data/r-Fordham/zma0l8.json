    "postText": "\n_Context:_\n\n\u201cEffective Tuesday, January 3, 2023, all battery-powered e-scooters, e-bikes, and e-skateboards are banned from use or storage on all University property, including all buildings on and off campus, and walkways and sidewalks within the campus.\n\nThis has become necessary due to the recent surge in deadly fires in New York City from batteries, and the Fire Department\u2019s (FDNY) safety recommendations regarding lithium-ion batteries used in these devices. Nearly 140 people have been hurt and six people have been killed in fires caused by lithium-ion batteries in New York City in 2022, according to FDNY, which has opened more than 200 investigations into battery-related fires since January 1, 2022.\n \nThe storage and charging of lithium-ion batteries in residence halls and other University buildings represent a serious hazard, as they may explode, causing injuries and starting fires.\u201d\n\n**Why we should protest this Ban**\n\nFirst of all, a large number of students already utilize battery powered objects to go to and from different areas of campus, which includes classes, train stops, and even off-campus stores. The truth is, these battery-powered items provide an ease of transportation without breaking the bank. Additionally, Fordham\u2019s campus has a unique environment where there is ample space to ride the objects, as there are plenty of streets and sidewalks dedicated to vehicle use, not pedestrian use. These items are not putting pedestrians at risk. When it\u2019s cold out, these items offer a better alternative than walking, especially when it\u2019s scientifically proven that walking in the cold with strong wind could produce sickness. It\u2019s also important to mention that students who own these types of items aren\u2019t able to retune them, leaving an expensive item unusable.\n\nFinally, Lithium-Ion batteries do not pose a serious threat to any campus buildings nor even the campus itself. The lithium-ion cells have been designed with battery safety measures like Pressure-sensitive vent holes, Separator serves as a fuse, and Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC), which all serve as safety measures. Most of the very few fire cases involving lithium-ion batteries are a result of improper use, like keeping the battery next to a very high heat source. Additionally, Public Safety was incorrect in it\u2019s statement \u201cFire extinguishers do not work on lithium-ion batteries.\u201d \u201cIn case of fire,\u00a0 a standard ABC or BC dry chemical fire extinguisher must be used since these are considered Class B fire. A common misconception is that lithium-ion batteries contain any actual lithium metal. They don\u2019t and that\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t use a Class D Fire Extinguisher. There are new and improved methods to douse lithium fires as well. The Aqueous Vermiculite Dispersion (AVD) is a fire extinguishing agent that disperses chemically exfoliated vermiculite in the form of a mist\u201d (Ion Energy). \n\nPublic Safety\u2019s misinformed decision requires another look. If phones, cars, and even vapes, which ALL HAVE LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES, can be allowed on campus, so can EV bikes, skateboards, and even onewheelers should too!\n\n#**Fordham Student Body, KEEP RIDING!**",

I do think the school could have a lock-up area inside the gates for commuter students to put scooters/bikes.\n\nBut if you're on RH, for God's sake, just walk to class like every nondisabled student has since the dawn of the university.  Also:  \"**it\u2019s scientifically proven that walking in the cold with strong wind could produce sickness**\" sorry, could you link to any study that shows that walking outside in the cold for ten minutes will significantly increase the chances of illness???",

This is all about **BIG OIL** trying to control us and get us to use gas powered vehicles. Fordham is mandated to take federal funding and this is just one of the many corrupt doings that has come from it. I\u2019ll still be riding and I encourage you all too.",

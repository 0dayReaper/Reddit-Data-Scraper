    "postText": "I have recently accepted my offer at Fordham's Gabelli School of Business (Finance Major) and have started considering a change of schools. For reference, I am an international Asian student wishing to break into banking after graduation. I understand that Gabelli gives a bit of an edge in recruiting and networks, but how much difference does it make? \n\nI plan to shift my school to Fordham's College of Liberal Arts. The Math/Economics major offered by the school is STEM-certified, while the Gabelli School of Business provides no STEM-certified majors (except for information technology). Would this be an good major to pursue banking? Would I miss out on a lot, considering that I wouldn't be in the business school?",

STEM majors are eligible for a two-year extension which unfortunately does not apply to a finance major. What is the general route the international students at Fordham follow to counteract this? Surely not all international students at Gabelli must be majoring in Information Systems? (what are your opinions of this major though)",

Thankyou so much for your response!\n\nThe STEM certification would be eligible for a two-year OPT extension after I graduate (which improves my chances of getting a H1B visa). Would it still be worth it?\n\nAnother option is to double major at Gabelli in Information Systems (STEM certified) and Finance. How difficult would such a route be, and do many people double major?",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo I got accepted at Fordham Rose Hill. I applied as a commuter student but in hindsight, I am not sure that is such a good idea since I live in brooklyn(  my commute is 1 hour 30 minutes). Is my commute that bad? I would absolutely live on campus or near it if I could afford it though. Should I look at other options?\n\nP.S. for the commuter students, how do you make friends not living on campus? Also is the Metro card grant of any help?\n\nThank you:)",

If you can handle it, if you can step out of our comfort zone, etc.\n\nHere\u2019s my experience: \nFreshman year I did 1hr 30min commutes each way for a total of 3hrs a day, and Fordham usually gives freshman class everyday so they don\u2019t feel overwhelmed. For me that meant 15 hours a week on multiple busses and a train doing absolutely nothing. I get motion sick so all I could really do listen to music, audio books, and podcasts (which gets old fast). By the time I\u2019d get to school I\u2019d feel so exhausted I couldn\u2019t focus, and would have to teach the in class material to myself later anyways. When I\u2019d make my way home I\u2019d be so tired all I could do was sleep. For me making friends was hard, sure I had and still have some people I could talk to from class and orientation, but because everyone is either on campus or scattered across the tri-state you either get left out or you never really hang out. For me it wasn\u2019t really enough to just talk to people it\u2019s important to actually have fun outside of that which was pretty much never happened. I gave clubs a try too, but they were either scheduled during my classes or very late at night so I was limited there. The people I met in clubs too weren\u2019t really my crowed either. People were either too cutthroat preprofessional all the time, a little strange (respectfully), or just stuck with their own groups they already had. Ultimately it\u2019s just easier to make meaningful friendships if you dorm. So yeah, long commutes made me perpetually tired and lonely.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that\u2019s everything though, I got my commutes to a manageable 45mis each way for a total commute of 1.5hrs a day and I only have class 3 days a week. I gave up on friends from Fordham and looked elsewhere.  I made friends by going out to bars, working, reaching out my good high school friends and becoming friends with their friends, going on dating apps and going out, and talking to people on discord.\n\nI want to stress that\u2019s my story, and for everyone like me there\u2019s someone whose had a great time as a commuter. It all comes down to you, at the end of the day, just be prepared for your college experience to be different than you imagined.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m also a commuter and your commute to RH is about my commute to LC (I commuted to RH for a semester but that ended up being 2 hours 15 mins and I just could not do that again). I\u2019d say it\u2019s not the worst commute if you\u2019re used to commuting from high school and I usually use the time to do my readings for class. It all depends on how you make use of that time. \n\nAs for making friends, Fordham has a commuters discord/Commuting Students Association which is where I\u2019ve made a bunch of friends. They plan brunches, game nights, and outings to different museums and parks. I\u2019ve also just made friends through my classes.\n\nThe Metro Grant doesn\u2019t really help much in terms of paying for your metro card since it\u2019s just an extra scholarship framed for commuter students. Don\u2019t get me wrong it\u2019s great to have the extra money towards my tuition but I\u2019ve seen a lot of people think it\u2019s money towards paying for commuting which just isn\u2019t true. If you have any other questions feel free to dm me!",

My current commute is 40 minutes and I usually form study guides/ review my notes so I think I'll  be okay. \nAlso thanks for the advice about the CSA! I found them on Instagram. \nI really hoped the Metro grant would be for buying metrocards and stuff. I guess it'll just go towards  my fees .",

I paid the most out of all my friends but my dipshit friend and my dipshit self decided a 1200/month shoebox was a good idea. Other friends had actual houses.\n\nI will say, though, I met a lot my currently close friends and my girlfriend of six years in our freshman dorms. My on-campus experience was foundational and formative for every decision I made thereafter and how I grew as a person; though, of course, everybody\u2019s journey is different.",

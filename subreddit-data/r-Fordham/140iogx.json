    "postText": "Hey everyone. After searching for a group chat to connect with other GSAS students at Fordham, I could not find any Discord servers. So me and a couple of other incoming GSAS students have created a discord server for students to join and help each other out.\n\nThe discord server invitation link: [https://discord.gg/nQTHVsyW33](https://discord.gg/nQTHVsyW33)\n\nFeel free to join. Let's build this server so we can all help each other out and especially find places and roommates to rent with.",

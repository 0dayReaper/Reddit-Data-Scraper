    "postText": "My freshman is having the most horrible time in Spanish. First semester was bad but the professor was actually very nice and supportive unlike the professor this semester. She has been in tutoring all year multiple times a week and tried office hours with professor who was very unhelpful. She has put so much time and effort into the class and is still on the verge of failing. Getting a D will kill her gpa since a C did last semester. She really can't continue to the next class because she doesn't know anything. She took 3 years of Spanish in high school and is so frustrated. Any advice? Is summer school easier? Can you take it at another university? She may need to transfer because of this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

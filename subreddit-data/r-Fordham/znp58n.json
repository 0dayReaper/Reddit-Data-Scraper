It seems like a lot of people got deferred, and I've also seen several posts from last year saying a decent amount of deferred students end up getting accepted--so I'm assuming it's true. Especially because a lot of applicants end up withdrawing (a few of my friends were deferred as well and just decided to withdraw) I'm just hoping for the best but I'm questioning whether I should switch my campus to Rose Hill.",

Try to reach out to an Admissions rep or sm and explain your situation and why you wanna go. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s allowed, but I\u2019m pretty sure. There\u2019s no hurt in trying :-)",

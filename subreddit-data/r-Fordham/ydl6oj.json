We had to go see some off-broadway shows and review them which was actually pretty cool. They don\u2019t expect you to have acting experience but you do have to read lines in front of the class and our final was to perform the monologue of our choice. \n\nIf Mark Greenfield is teaching at LC, absolutely take him. One of the best professors I had.",

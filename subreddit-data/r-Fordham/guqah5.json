St. Vincent (many of whom taught at Fordham) participating in the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March. A large group of Fordham Jesuits, students, and community members travelled to Selma together. As we see many in the media trying to change the narrative around contemporary protests to one of violence (which also occurred in response to the Selma March), let us remember that most protesters are protesting in this spirit of faith, justice, and peace.\n\nedited: I assumed the kneeling photographer was a student but realized he could be a member of the faculty or staff.",

From protecting black people during lunch counter sit-ins, to giving tenure to father Daniel Barrigan, who burned draft cards. In the 60\u2019s Fordham was an activism hotspot, as it should be again today. \n\nIf y\u2019all wanna get involved there\u2019s a number of clubs on campus doing advocacy. FordhamYDSA, Pride, Students for Justice in Palestine, and so many more. Join and get involved.",

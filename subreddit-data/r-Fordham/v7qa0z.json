    "postText": "i got into fordham with an 89 GPA and got a 90 in AP Macro and 95 in AP Micro during my junior year. i passed AP Stats my first semester but completely gave up in the class after my AP Stats test (which i definitely failed). i stopped going completely and will have an \u201cNS/No Show\u201d on my transcript for my final semester. i am passing my other classes with around an 85 in each class. AP Stats is the only class i will fail and will receive the \u201cNS\u201d mark and i saw that AP Stats isn\u2019t a required course for the Gabelli School of Business. i\u2019ve seen other posts where people have failed a class or two or got really bad grades and still got in but i\u2019m still worried that i\u2019m going to get rescinded. what are my chances of not being rescinded?",

It is way more work for the college to rescind you than it is for them to accept you as planned (along with the thousands of other students). This year was very hard for me too, but I see my time at Fordham as an opportunity to make a comeback. In the meantime, celebrate being done with high school!!",

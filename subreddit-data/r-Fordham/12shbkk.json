I want to double major in history and polisci which campus would have better professors/more classes for my majors? And as a gay slightly alt woman where would I find my people?",

            "comment": "LC definitely has more of your crowd, both major-wise and class-wise. However, I do know many polisci majors at RH who haven\u2019t had an issue (and gays for that matter). LC isn\u2019t a horrible commute, but I live on RH so I am definitely biased. It comes down to what you like. If you want to be in Manhattan with much less of a campus feel and zero college bars etc., LC is the way to go. And the opposite is true for RH, if you want to feel more in a college campus obv RH is the way to go. There are endless groups of people that you\u2019ll fit in with both on RH and LC, although you do have all the athletes and actually religious people on RH. Make your decision, but know that freshman year you will most likely have all your classes available on the campus you choose. And you can always transfer between.\n\nHope this helped! Good luck.",

There\u2019s more classes at RH since it\u2019s the bigger campus, but you\u2019ll still have plenty of options at LC. If you ever really want to take a class at RH, the ram van is doable. I did it for 3 classes during my time there",

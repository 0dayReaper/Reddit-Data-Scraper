AFAIK this is the first time she\u2019s taught an intro course over the past 4 years I\u2019ve been at Fordham so I\u2019m not sure there are any old resources available. CS1 shouldn\u2019t be too bad it\u2019s a fairly easy intro course. One thing to note, she\u2019s known to sometimes rush over some concepts in class so I highly recommend you go to her office hours as she is much more helpful there. Nice lady and she\u2019s the head of the department so be sure to keep in touch for future referrals.",

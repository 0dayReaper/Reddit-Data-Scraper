My only alternative as of right now won't be open to me for registration until August and its still a big IF.\n\nSo my schedule currently has philosophy and theology in my first semester (neither are ep1)\n\nIs it doable? because I've heard upperclassmen forbidding this combination.",

If you\u2019re a good reader and writer, you\u2019ll do fine, if otherwise, I\u2019d recommend breaking them up and not taking them simultaneously.",

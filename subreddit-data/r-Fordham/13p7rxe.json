            "comment": "Mandarin I can guarantee will be very interesting but a bunch more difficult for the fact that Spanish is far closer to English. I would recommend using rate my professor and if you\u2019re interested in Mandarin then to take it but if after the first two-ish classes the professor\u2019s terrible, you still have the add/drop period to switch to Spanish",

I took a Mandarin for business (entry level) course sophomore year but had to withdraw because of missing to much class time because of medical stuff. Super interesting course, don\u2019t think it\u2019s offered anymore though.",

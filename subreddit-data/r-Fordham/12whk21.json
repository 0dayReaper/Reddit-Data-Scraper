    "postText": "Ok guys. I\u2019m planning on becoming a patent lawyer(hoping) and am deciding between Binghamton SUNY and Fordham Lincoln center. (A lot to be explained) At Fordham LC, I\u2019m planning on majoring in integrative neuroscience and history. (Both majors offered at LC) I\u2019m a senior at LaGuardia highschool, so Fordham LC is literally 2 blocks away from my High school, making the trip really easy. I\u2019ll live at home, obviously. It seems like Fordham has the better law aspect to it imo. Now Binghamton has offered me admission into their source fellowship program, which allows me to conduct research and be published my freshman year. The only problem is that it\u2019s all the hell way in Vestal, NY. I really don\u2019t wanna move all the way out here. The aid at Bing is more affordable, but we\u2019re gonna appeal Fordham for more hopefully. These are my 2 options. (NYU wants me to pay 85,000 a year so no \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d) Guys plz help I need to make a decision fast. (Thx)",

    "postText": "Hey everyone. I\u2019m a incoming freshmen at rose hill and was wondering if Spanish 1501 was hard. It was the class I was placed in but I was also guessing on most of the questions in the placement exam. The class summary said it was conducted in Spanish and I think that would be way too difficult for the first year. Any answers would be appreciated.",

I feel like I\u2019ve been getting rejected more when I go up to talk to girls whereas I was usually pretty lucky when mcshane was still here. Anyone else feel the same way? I feel like it\u2019s something Tania did, anyone got any ideas",

Why are you blaming the president for why you aren't successful with women? Maybe look in the mirror first or reflect on where you're lacking in your character. Also, cold approaches just aren't really a way to meet people outside of bars/clubs/parties either so I'm not surprised that isn't working out for you.",

I\u2019ve been seriously depressed for a while and feel like I have nobody to talk to. I only feel comfortable enough to post this here because my identity is hidden and I feel too embarrassed to admit my feelings in person...I\u2019m at a loss right now and don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m struggling and I don\u2019t think I can do much to help myself",

Definitely look into doing that sooner rather than later, cuz i think they're starting to hire people for it now.\n\nAs for scheduling during the semester, they work completely around your class schedule, but they're also working around like 100+ other people's class schedules, so you're likely to get some kinda lame shifts (early morning, late evening, fueling, etc.) especially when just starting out. It's also only 12 hours a week during the semester, so it's not all too overwhelming unless you do a bunch of other shit on top of your classes already.",

            "comment": "Fordham does offer up to 10 free counseling sessions. That doesn't fix the long term,  but it might help to have a professional validate you. \n\nOtherwise,  consider finding people to interact with around a mutual hobby.  If you like fornite or Minecraft find a discord and game with people.  If you're an artist start a once a week drawing group. You can do this on zoom or in person. Im in a Facebook group with other veterans in media and entertainment. While you're searching for others,  be kind to yourself.  Im a writer and I found a great long term critique partner off a critique website.  She's excellent,  but only one of 30 people I've worked with and it took me a year to find her.  Finding your people takes time! Maybe a zoom get together once a week with family or friends might help. \n\nOtherwise,  invest in yourself: learn a new skill,  watch educational videos,  etc.  This doesn't kill the loneliness but it can sure as hell distract you. \n\nIf your vaccinated or careful,  consider a gym (any physical activity,  really) to get those endorphins going.  Maybe long walks around the city exploring the art of [flanurie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A2neur) (not sure if it's spelled right)\n\nYou'll get through this,  but I also understand how isolating everything can feel right now.  You're not alone.  Just try to be kind to yourself.  My DMs are open if you need to chat.",

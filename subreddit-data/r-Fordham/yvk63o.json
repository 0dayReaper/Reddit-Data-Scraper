Royal mint has nicer accommodations (marginally nicer furniture/fixtures) but is definitely further from school than Hoxton. Hoxton has a bus that runs right outside that goes straight to school, but Royal mint students have to take the tube. Additionally Royal Mint housing is more strict with visitors, and does not allow any visitors outside of Royal mint, but Hoxton allows anyone up to quiet hours. The views from Royal Mint are nicer though, and the apartment is more upscale, but the rooms are a little bit smaller.",

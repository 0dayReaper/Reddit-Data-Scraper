The survey asks participants to engage with statements about school\u2019s policies regarding COVID-19, and how racial justice is being taught during this time. We expect the survey to take between 10 and 15 minutes of your time, and your participation will be anonymous.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot offer compensation at this time; however, we hope you will consider participating given the potential communal benefits of this work.

    "postText": "So apparently all first-year and transfer students are required to waste TWO AND A HALF HOURS on online sexual assault and alcohol classes. In summary, these classes pretty much consist of: \"don't commit SA or do drugs, kids. That's bad\"\n\nIn short, I am really busy this summer and am struggling to find time to waste on these online classes. Therefore, I was wondering what happens if you do not complete these classes. Does the university not let you enter? Or do they just forget about it?",

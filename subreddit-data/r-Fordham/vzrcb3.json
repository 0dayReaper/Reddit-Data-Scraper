    "postText": "Any MSW students here hate the schedule of classes? I\u2019m basically taking 5 classes in one day \u2026.. I can\u2019t do Saturday\u2019s and there\u2019s no other day available. I don\u2019t see myself coming in on Tuesday for just one class so I scheduled all for Thursdays. \n\n10 minute gaps in between?? Is there enough time to go from one msw class to the next? How are the professors like? Class structure?",

What year are you? Because there were basically no options for specialist year students on Thursday",

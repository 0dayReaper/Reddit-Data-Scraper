    "postText": "Hello, my roommates and I are after signing a lease to a house on 187th and Bathgate. We originally had 4 but one of them dropped out. We're all Juniors and have one Gabelli kid and two rose hill majors. The rent is going to be 3600 per month total, but you can be paying more or less than 900 depending on which room you live in. I have links that show floor plans and size of the place but I dont really wanna drop it on reddit so if you are interested just dm me.",

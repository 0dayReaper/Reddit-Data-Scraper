    "postText": "Hi all. I\u2019m a junior at Tulane who will be interning in Midtown over the summer and am looking for a place to live June 6-August 14 (prorated rent), although I am open to paying for 3 months if it is a good enough price. Budget is 1600/month. Preferably furnished but can deal with unfurnished. Within 30 minute commute to around the Rockefeller center. I am female and would like to live with other girls. \n\nAbout me- I\u2019m a native New Orleanian who loves to cook! I will definitely cook you red beans and rice if we live together. \nI was an au pair in Paris after high school, and I speak nearly fluent French. \nMy major is Econ!\n\n\nF.Y.I-   My friend is also looking, so 2 available rooms would be awesome!",

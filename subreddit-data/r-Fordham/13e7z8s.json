Im majoring in finance hoping to go into Investment banking, private equity, hedge fund, or asset management. Im aware there are multiple clubs and societies about these.\n\nCan someone give me a rundown and ranking of the available finance clubs, which is best to join and which ones are there?\n\nAlso, for the finance Gabelli students, how has the recruiting for you been? Im aware fordham is not a target but im wondering if its still doable.",

    "postText": "Hi y\u2019all, I\u2019m in a bit of a dilemma. I got accepted into Fordham\u2019s Rose Hill campus EA back in mid December but after touring both the LC and RH, on top of talking to a few current students, I wanted to transfer from RH to LC. My question is, is it possible to make this change after I\u2019ve just been accepted cause when I searched it up Fordham says something along the lines of requiring you to complete at least a year but then on my applicant portal it gives me the option to switch. How likely is Fordham to grant this request and if so, would I have any issues with dorming (ex: rooming on RH campus but going to school on LC campus)?",

            "comment": "The switch between campuses is extremely easy and you should have no issue with the portal or getting accepted. However, from my own personal experience as a transfer student between campuses, LC is frankly a pathetic campus, with a pathetic social setting (it's non-existant) and a sad dull feeling to it (it literally was a highschool before being bought by Fordham). I highly highly HIGHLY recommend staying at RH, I guarantee you won't regret it. If it is the Manhattan life you are seeking, it's just a short train ride away from the RH campus, you will not miss out on anything by staying. In conclusion, I would never return to LC, I'd rather not even attend university at that point. Take that as you may, good luck. Don't go to LC for your own good, unless you are a dance or gender studies major lol.",

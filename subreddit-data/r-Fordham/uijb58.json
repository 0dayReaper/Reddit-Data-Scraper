The courses are tough, but if you maintain the perspective that they are training you to be a quality scientist you can succeed. You'll hear things like \"weed out course\" and \"Dr X doesn't care about students\" but these are not true. There is simply a standard set by scientists who are passionate about their subject. I'm happy to DM about it.",

Usually the admission counselors will set you up with your initial classes, but future classes will be selected with the assistance of a Biology faculty advisor. You can expect your first year to include Intro Bio as well as Intro Chem. Bio labs are 2 days per week, 2 hours each. \n\nOnce you survive your first year and you get to know some faculty, you'll want to start thinking about a research experience with someone. Most jobs and graduate programs will be looking for these experiences. Plus you will get some quality behind-the-curtain insights from your faculty mentor and graduate students.\n\nAs to life outside the dept, I can't really say! As grad students we are very cloistered in our depts and labs.",

Each instructor will have their own separate late policy. I don't know what kind of homework/assignments faculty assign, so can't speak to that. There will be 2-3 exams, varying amounts of cumulative content.\n\nLabs are more uniform because each lab section can have students from different lecture sections. Assignments are usually straight forward and laid out. they will be weekly or biweekly. One big paper per semester (unless they changed it).",

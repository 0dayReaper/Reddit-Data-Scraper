            "comment": "Disclaimer: transferring from FCLC to Gabelli is not guaranteed. It is much harder to transfer into Gabelli than out of Gabelli. The business school at Lincoln Center also has a minimum math requirement of Calculus. That being said, on your applicant portal, there should be a form that says \"campus change\" or \"major change\" something like that. If you need any more help, reach out to your counselor!",

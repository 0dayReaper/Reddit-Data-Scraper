    "postText": "Today Fordham decided to ban all electric vehicles on campus including the storage of them. This includes e-skateboards, e-bikes, e-scooters, and onewheels. I think this was a very misinformed decision and we should do something to persuade public safety to remove this ban. If you are part of the EV community on campus please reach out to me.",

I went to LC and had classes all on the upper floors and walked up and down the stairs every day to get to class instead of using the overcrowded elevators. I was actually in the best shape of my life then from choosing legs over lazy shortcuts like e-wheels and elevators.",

The thing is, we should be encouraging these modes of Transportation rather then having gas vehicles. The reason the fire happens is because people by cheep Chinese off brand parts that go up in flames. If they wanted to allow certain notable companies that's fine but to ban batteries is stupidity, Electric Cars have batteries too yet they will allow that.",

Can confirm lithium ion batteries are a large potential for fire and thermal runaway and to your point, students aren\u2019t sleeping in the parking garage and it\u2019s a straight concrete structure. If a fire breaks out there the potential for someone dying is significantly lower.",

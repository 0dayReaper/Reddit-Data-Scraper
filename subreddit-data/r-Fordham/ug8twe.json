    "postText": "hello - i recently committed to fordham lincoln center and am accepted into the honors program there. the first-year schedule is pretty intense with very little wiggle room. the advantage of this is that your schedule becomes much more adaptable and self-steered in the following years. i have a few questions if anyone is willing to share their insight:\n\n1. what is the course rigor freshman year? i am anticipating a pretty jarring shift from high school to college classwork. personally, the year-long science class seems most intimidating as i am definitely more of an english/social studies person.\n\n2. do honors students tend to bond together since they are in all of each other\u2019s classes? and is it easy to make friends outside of the honors program?\n\n3. is it worth it?\n\nthank you!",

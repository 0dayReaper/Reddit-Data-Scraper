    "postText": "I\u2019m an international transfer coming into Fordham this fall. My home campus is in RH but most of my classes are in LC. All my classes start at 8:30 AM daily so I was wondering what time I should take the ram van to make it to my morning classes in RH. I live in Manhattan about a 10 minuet commute from the LC campus.",

    "postText": "I got accepted into fordham\u2019s rose hill campus and it\u2019s one of my top choices. I have an apartment 45 minutes away near carnegie hall. I was wondering if there are commuters this far away and how would I get to the campus? Driving or the subway? I\u2019m new to the city so I am not sure.",

            "comment": "Not a commuter but if you\u2019re near the Lincoln Center campus, which you may be if you\u2019re close to Caragie Hall, you may want to try the RamVan. It travels between RH and LC\u2019s campuses directly with the first LC departures at 7:15/8am weekdays and has trips every half hour at the :00 and 0:30 with the last RH departures at 11pm at the earliest. It\u2019s $3.50 one way, but you can purchase tickets in bulk which gives you 12 tickets for the price of 10 tickets. If you take classes at both campuses, you can apply to get some free passes as well. Takes about a half hour to an hour to travel between campuses (rarely it can take longer at rush hour) and drops you fairly close to the majority of the class buildings. It\u2019s more expensive than the D train, but overall commute times including waiting for the train and then walking to RH is less. Pro-tip: Make a reservation on the RamVan website the day before you need to travel and buy tickets online ahead of time. \n\nIf you do want to do the subway, the D line as I mentioned is your best bet, take it to Fordham Rd/Grand Concourse and it\u2019s about a 7-10min walk to campus. Metro North is also possible, and I know a lot of commuters do use it. It\u2019s a little pricer, but if you\u2019re closer to Grand Central it\u2019s probably the fastest option.",

I commute to LC from Williamsburg which takes about 35 minutes and I don\u2019t mind at all. It goes by fast. Also, many kids at Fordham commute so you\u2019re not an odd one out.\n\nIf you do commute to Rose Hill, I would probably just take the ram van. It\u2019s free if you go there for classes and it\u2019s reliable and safe.",

I would suggest the ram van if you\u2019re close to Lincoln center but you do need to reserve a spot each day before they are all taken. Even with that though you could just take the subway which is about 40 minutes from LC to RH",

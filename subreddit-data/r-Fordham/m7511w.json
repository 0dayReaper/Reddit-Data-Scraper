Many of those employees depend on the students being there so they can have a livelihood.

We conduct more tests per capita (PCR tests, by the way, which have their own set of issues regarding efficacy, as Tony Fauci himself said). Additionally, in a meta analysis of the correlation between mask wearing and covid cases, there was virtually no discernible correlation between increased mask usage and decreased covid transmission. Finally, if lockdowns worked so well, why is this all still going on? \n\nFurthermore, countries with some of the strictest mitigation measures (such as Peru) had some of the highest covid rates, while a study in the United States Marine Corps showed that marines in full lockdown and full mask usage (mandated by drill sergeants) had more covid than marines living normally.\n\nWith that said, I am happy to consider any data you may have to the contrary.",

Let me make myself clearer.\n\nIf you've gone to barnyard this academic year, **go fuck yourself**.\n\nBar hopping during normal life is completely fine. I was looking forward to it. But, life had other plans, and now I and thousands of other students have to attend college with covid making its rounds. I'm well aware of the low death rate of covid among young people. But I'm also well aware of how it is a literal health risk that spreads like wildfire if precautions aren't taken, and that the university needs to shut shit down if it starts spreading through campus. Which means that the students trying to socialize through clubs and such get completely fucked over. And there's no better place for covid to spread than a small bar in the Bronx packed with socially starved 18 year olds with no mask on. But unlike some washed-up alumnus in the comments seems to think, going to a bar isn't the only way to socialize. *Especially* during a pandemic. You can safely socialize with people in your building in each other's rooms. Yeah, it's still not 100% safe, but it's a lot safer than a public bar with a fuckton of people packed in. And guess what? It's just as easy to buy drinks at a place that doesn't card and drink in your room with your friends as it is to go to a packed bar that doesn't card.\n\ntl;dr - I know covid doesn't instantly kill the people that get it, and I never said that either. Covid spreads at barnyard. Students that spread and get covid at barnyard come back to campus. They spread covid to students that are being safe. Fordham shuts shit down. The safe students get fucked over. That's not fair. Wear a mask. Drink in your room.",

What the opposite side is saying that everyone deserves to have their own college experience, and the students who are deathly afraid should take the precautions they feel are right.  You can not control somebody else\u2019s actions.  If you are scared, you accept the risk that you might get COVID being on a college campus.  YOU stay home from the bars.  If I were still there, I\u2019d be one of the maskless students at those bars, but when you\u2019re taking the precautions you deem necessary and avoiding people, that will very likely not affect you.  There\u2019s always a small chance it will.  If you can\u2019t deal with that, then stay at home and take classes online until you\u2019re vaccinated.  I\u2019m not responsible for the health of a classmate or that classmate\u2019s elderly relatives.  Sorry.  I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re throwing away the best years of your life drinking in someone\u2019s stuffy dorm room.  I promise you, you will look back one day and regret having thrown your life away like this.  But you are a lost cause, so I\u2019m done.

I genuinely didn\u2019t think it as bad as people were saying and all my friends said it was a good opportunity to make friends, as I wasn\u2019t on campus last semester. But when I got there, it was extremely bad.. no masks, not just Fordham students but loads of other students from neighboring schools (Bronx community college, Manhattan college), no social distancing and everyone was standing and jumping so closely together. If I recall correctly as well the DJ was telling everyone to get up and dance, basically creating a huge COVID mosh pit. I left after 30 minutes because the crowd made me so uncomfortable, not saying that I\u2019m better than the people who went that day, I\u2019m just as bad as I decided to go myself. After leaving I honestly felt terrible for going and got tested the next day, packed up my stuff and spent 2 weeks at home quarantining just in case I did get COVID. \n\nSo to everyone who plans to go to barnyard every weekend please re-evaluate that terrible decision, getting covid from a bar doesn\u2019t make you quirky",

If you use the same counting methodology that they do for the flu (which is also more deadly for people under 65), the death rate is 0.13%\n-If you are so concerned about contracting the virus (which, by the way, asymptomatic transmission of a respiratory virus is basically nonexistent - which \u201cDr.\u201d Fauci himself said), cant you just wear your woke mask and everything is alright?\n\nThe covid flu does exist and has killed people, but the so called mitigation measures have taken more lives than the covid ever will",

A meta analysis of mask usage versus infection rate on a county level across the country showed virtually no correlation between increased mask usage and decreased covid rates.\n\nAlso, if all those mitigation measures work, why the lockdowns? And if all the lockdowns, why the masks?\n\nAdditionally, regarding the please don\u2019t be stupid comment, the lockdowns have killed people. A lot of people, with suicides, drug overdoses, etc. spiking, all for something with shaky science at best supporting it. \n\nPlease provide me with data supporting your claims, don\u2019t just accept what the CDC and SJ called public health officials blindly say (remember, Tony Fauci said masks aren\u2019t needed and wrote a paper arguing against lockdowns)",

Regardless if that\u2019s true their was a real possibility if cases got to certain point we\u2019d all be sent home and that means thousands of my own money gets sent down the drain so it\u2019s definitely fine to tell barnyard goers to fuck themselves lmao",

My mistake, \u201cpositive tests.\u201d  I know you\u2019re now going to cherry pick the one young person you know who died or whose heart functioning was destroyed, but you do that all you want.  I\u2019ll respond with the link to that data.  College is not all about grades.  Part of it is about socializing, about meeting new people, and there\u2019s no better way to do that than gathering at the local bars.  You don\u2019t need to go to those bars if you\u2019re so scared.  In fact, you should stay home and do college online.  But you have completely crossed the line if you think you can tell the other students not to have the college experience they want.  Once again, go to hell.",

I\u2019m not concerned about students. I\u2019m concerned about passing it to grandma down the street you heartless fuck.\n\n: also when did you get the idea I\u2019m telling students what to do?? They have a right to go to an open bar. I also have a right to call them whatever I want",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm going to be studying abroad in London for the upcoming fall semester with the Gabelli program.  I was wondering, what days are classes typically held on? I ask this because I'm trying to figure out how long I can plan some weekend vacation trips to elsewhere in Europe. As well, how many times do people typically leave the UK during their study abroad time? Do people usually go abroad with others who they meet in the program on short trips? Lastly, anyone know when the first study abroad meeting will be held? I believe it's in April, but I don't know a date. I can't wait to meet others who are planning some European travel while there.",

Some people get lucky with setting up the schedule (I took 16 credits but had 5 day weekends) and others do not (my friend had Monday\u2014Thursday classes).\n\nHow many times you leave the UK is totally up to you, but I\u2019d make sure that you have enough time to actually explore within the UK as well. Feel free to dm me if you have any other questions regarding study abroad!\n\nI personally travelled solo everywhere I went but there were definitely people traveling in groups. A lot of people came to the study abroad program with those they were already friends with in NYC and set up trips immediately amongst themselves.",

When you make a semester plan, go to the advanced search options and specify that you want London campus classes. That way you\u2019ll see which classes/class sections are offered in the fall",

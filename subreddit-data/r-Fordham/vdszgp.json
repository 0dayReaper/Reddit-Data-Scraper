If what the previous poster is true, (and I totally believe her) that grad school is about making connections, then going for 3 years should be the way to go. \n\nDo you mind if I ask if you are working? I'm pretty nervous about all this, but excited at the same time!! I will def look you up when I go to the orientation! If I can't find you, you can find me, I'm probably the only old person there! lol How do I dm you if I don't know you? See this is just getting fun.",

From my experience your going to build a rapport with the professors if you take them multiple times and they are a great resource to have first and then you expand that network when you start interning it can also help you get a job when you finish your time at the agency",

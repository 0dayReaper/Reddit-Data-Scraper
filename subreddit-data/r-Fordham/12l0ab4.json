(e.g., Ground Floor, Macroeconomics).\n\nSophomore year Gabelli students cannot make their own schedule. They must select from a predetermined class schedule list which selection of classes and at what times they will be taking, for both semesters. If they have any extra classes they have credits for (such as ILCs), they may independently register for those after the fact. \n\nJunior and Senior year, Gabelli students make their own schedules.",

This means you have around 5 classes you are req to take each prospective semester and you have all yourt classes with the same 30 people. You can choose of like 10 cohorts but they get filled up quickly. You usually get your third or forth choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in rose hill my first semester of freshman year tho, as i transferred to gabelli. I registered for my own classes. i did it a few days late  and with bad wifi as i was a confused and underprepared freshman who was on vacation. This was also during COVID (class of 2020) so I did not have much guidance. With all that, I still got in all the classes I needed with great profs that had pretty good ratings.",

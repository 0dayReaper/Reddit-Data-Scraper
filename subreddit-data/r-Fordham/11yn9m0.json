    "postText": "hey guys, I\u2019m a senior in high school planning to go to Fordham (Lincoln center campus). I really like what I\u2019ve seen of the school so far but the only thing that\u2019s turning me away, or that I feel kinda unsure about, is the religious aspect. Are there any religious courses that are required? Is Catholicism pushed or anything? I just don\u2019t really want to go to a religious school, but from what I\u2019ve heard from other people, the religious aspect isn\u2019t really a thing on campus, but I just wanna hear more opinions. It\u2019s not like this is something that would completely turn me away from the school or anything, I just wanna know. Thanks!\n\nI\u2019ll be commuting to campus, my intended major is environmental studies, but I really want to continue studying music! Specifically vocal, I\u2019m also a vocal major right now at LaGuardia (literally 5 blocks away from the LC campus..\ud83d\ude05)\n\nSo, if you have any other general college advice for an incoming freshman at Fordham, please share!",

You do have to take two theology classes, but they focus on all religions and are designed to teach you to be more understanding and ethical. They absolutely do not just shove texts like the Bible in your face. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it all! :)",

There are two theology classes as part of the core requirement, but I wouldn\u2019t say that Catholicism is necessarily forced on anyone. Some students may choose to be more involved with religious classes or groups, but that\u2019s up to each individual to choose for themselves. If you have any questions about commuting, going to college so close to high school, or anything like that, feel free to private message me!",

To add to that, the Theology department is one of the strongest voices for social justice at the school (and does really amazing work to those ends), which hopefully allays some fears about conservative religion etc.",

I was just admitted to BA economics at CWRU with the option to concentrate in quantitative methods and to \u2018BS Global Business with a concentration in global finance and business economics\u2019 at Lincoln centre NYC Fordham University. I am hoping to work in finance, investment banking, corporate banking, etc. I am hesitant about the location of CWRU and it being a predominantly engineering school as well as the ranking of Fordham. Which is the better option to choose?",

Gabelli is also a smaller business school, which allows for more individual attention with PPD and other great resources imho! Finance major here doing consulting and IB\u2014let me know if you have any questions!",

The only caveat is that you should aim to be at the top of your class ( i would say maintain a GPA as close to a 4.0, with a minimum of a 3.7), NETWORK, be ACTIVE in all related clubs (join all the clubs, trust me, I made the mistake of not joining all of them) and use the school resources (i.e., in your sophomore year you can apply for a program called the finance scholar, which preps your for app season).",

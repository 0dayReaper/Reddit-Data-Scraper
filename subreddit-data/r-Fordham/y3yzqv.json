    "postText": "1. I need to take linear algebra this spring to graduate and for my summer internship; however, Lincoln Center does not offer the class this upcoming semester. I am looking for 5+ other students who want to take the class because that\u2019s the minimum of how many students we need for the math department to add linear algebra to LC\u2019s spring offerings.\n\n2. Additionally, I am looking for any Fordham math discords to continue my search for linear-algebra-hungry students, but also because I want to meet more people in the Fordham math community.\n\nComment or DM me if you have any questions or have any information!\n\nSend this post to any math students you know at fordham!",

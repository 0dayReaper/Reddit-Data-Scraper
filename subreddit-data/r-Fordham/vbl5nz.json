    "postText": "I am a math major at LC and am on the waitlist for multivariable calc 1. I need this class to take almost all my other major requirements. My registration for Fall 2022 took forever to load and I was not able to get into the class but I thought it would be fine because I could take it spring semester. I am now realizing that the multivariable class in the spring is only offered at RH, and it's 3 days a week. I really do not want to make the trek to RH 3 days a week, but am worried I won't get off the waitlist. Is there any chance I can get into the class even if I don't get off the waitlist, and how would I go about doing that?",

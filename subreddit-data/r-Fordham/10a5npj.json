    "postText": "As you may already know if you've seen my other posts, Fordham Faculty United (FFU), the union representing \\~600 contingent faculty at Fordham, is going on strike beginning January 30, if Fordham doesn't offer us an acceptable deal before then. \n\nWe are holding a pre-strike RALLY in front of the Lincoln Center campus on **Thursday, January 19** **at noon**. Please come if you're free! The bigger it is, the bigger impact it can have. For instance, if Fordham can see that we have a lot of support, they might be more willing to offer us a good deal before the strike date. \n\nSome context:\n\n1. We've been negotiating with Fordham since April 2022\n2. None of us have gotten a raise in over a year, and inflation is up nearly 8% since our last raise\n3. The lowest-paid faculty in our union (folks teaching in the Graduate School of Religion) make only $4,600 per class, and all part timers are restricted to teaching a maximum of 4 classes per year. \n4. Part timers aren't eligible for any kind of health benefits\n\nHappy to answer any other questions about the strike/union/struggle. :)",

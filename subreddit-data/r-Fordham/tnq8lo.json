            "comment": "If u want to get into smf you'll get into smf, lol. You have multiple semesters to try and get in. The interview is  generally just a few professors and maybe members of smf asking you abt the mkt and stocks u like.\n\nOnly thing u need to watch out for is it fills a spot on ur schedule in degreeworks. Eg, if u take a finance course tht satisfies the same requirement that smf would satisfy, then there would be no academic reason to take smf.\n\nLastly, no, smf doesn't rly do anything regarding employment after Fordham. It's just like any other thing on your resume. If you replaced smf with a different real hedge fund or mutual fund internship, no employer would see a difference. \n\nI don't rly notice smf kids getting better jobs than ppl tht didn't do smf. Some smf students have great offers and others don't. I don't think smf was the make or break",

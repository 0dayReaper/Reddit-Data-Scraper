    "postText": "I'm a National Merit Semifinalist but I didn't get any scholarship in my acceptance.   \n\n\nNow I'm thinking that I didn't make the cutoff for scholarship past being National Merit. Their website says, \"The full-tuition award renewable for four years. All students who are designated as Semifinalists by the National Merit Recognition Program \\[...\\] will be considered for this scholarship. Of this pool of candidates last year, 71% of designees received the award.\" I think maybe I didn't make that pool. I also don't know if I had to indicate in my application anywhere that I wanted to be considered for those scholarships.  \n\n\nI thought that I would automatically qualify for full-tuition scholarship, but now I'm worried that I didn't and that ship has sailed. Is there something I'm not thinking about? What should I do?",

            "comment": "Hi! I think theres nothing to worry about if I\u2019m understanding everything correctly. You are automatically considered for any merit scholarship you are applicable for. \n\nYour financial aid package is not in the same location as your admissions decision. You receive that a little bit later in most cases, even if they try to release them to you simultaneously.\n\nSo if i understand correctly, you just haven\u2019t received the aid package yet?",

So I think it's either that-\n\n1. They have released all merit scholarship decisions, and I did not make it\n2. That they have some merit scholarship decisions with some still being left and being sent out in Jan + Feb with financial aid info.\n\nI recently saw this comment as well-[https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/xkgac4/comment/j0mp9vc/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/xkgac4/comment/j0mp9vc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nI think that maybe only ED applicants got their merit decisions and EA didn't.",

            "comment": "The ED/EA distinction makes sense, its more likely they gave out a couple merit aid decisions rather than most and not to a few (they are the exception not you). The admissions decision and the financial aid decision are separate decision making processes, so its also an exception that admissions will say you have merit aid since they are not a part of that decision.",

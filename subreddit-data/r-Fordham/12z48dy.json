    "postText": "\nHi! I\u2019m an admitted student at Fordham, and I\u2019m currently in the process of deciding between Bing and Fordham. I plan on majoring in English. \nI was originally planning on going to Williams College, but because of financial complications, I am now considering Bing/Fordham. Williams has a \"better\" department/program according to various college ranking sites and my own experience, and I am unsure about certain aspects of Fordham in general. For example, coming from someone who wanted to go to an LAC, I value personal relationships with professors. Will I be able to make those connections as an English major at Fordham? Furthermore, will I be taking large lecture courses as an English major? If so, will that be for all four years or only Freshman year?\nTo clarify, I\u2019m not really asking if I should go to Bing vs. Fordham. Rather, I\u2019m hoping to have a better understanding of the English major experience at Fordham. If you have any other suggestions or things that you think I should know, please do share. Thanks!",

            "comment": "In my experience as an English major, I think a very good majority, if not all, English professors know a decent amount about their students and personally care about them. Most English classes are capped at around 35, which I know probably sounds kinda large? but I personally don't think it is because my profs have been really good at remembering each and every one of students. I've definitely been able to have a good relationship with my profs. The classes are usually discussion-based as well, which makes sense for English classes.\n\nOnly thing is Composition II (a required English class for everyone no matter their major, teaches people to write basically) can be hit or miss depending on the prof, but even those classes are around 35 at most (probably less though since there's A LOT of sections). Every English class I've taken past that has been really good with course readings, discussions, and profs.\n\nThere are also smaller classes for English majors that are English-major only (seminars). There's a different topic every semester and they're restricted to juniors and seniors. And if you're into creative writing, there's a concentration and a minor for that with a few creative writing classes every semester, also with varying topics per semester. There's also a new professional writing minor (which I wish was made before I'm about to graduate........), and while there's not a lot of classes related to it yet, it's \"fresh\" to take something that goes beyond literature in my opinion.\n\nI mainly take classes at Lincoln Center, but I've taken some classes at RH during the Covid Zoom era, so my experience involves both campuses.\n\nMy biggest gripe though is the amount of classes offered-- my English major friends and I find it hard to find English classes that interest us every time we register for classes. Most English classes are the core classes (Comp II and Text and Contexts) and there's not as much for upper level classes. For upper level classes, it's a lot of historical literature classes (Shakespeare, etc.), which there's nothing wrong with of course, but English majors have to take a minimum of 3 historical literature classes to fulfill the major requirements, and if you're not really into that... good luck.\n\nFeel free to ask me any other questions, I'd be happy to help!",

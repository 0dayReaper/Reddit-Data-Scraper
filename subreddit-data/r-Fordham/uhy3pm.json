            "comment": "I've eaten at the dining hall almost every day for the past two years, and it's not as bad as people make it out to be. Don't get me wrong, it certainly is not great, but I would not call it so bad that spending additional time and money on cooking in a communal kitchen (as well as the *experience* that can be) is a better alternative than using the meal plan you're already forced to get.\n\nYou'll learn pretty quickly what the vile and repulsive stuff for your taste buds are, as well as what things might irritate your stomach, (if you don't learn from others), but you'll learn what your favorites are equally quickly. I have several go-tos in the dining hall that I genuinely enjoy when they have them.\n\n Overall, once you know what to avoid and what to gravitate to, it's honestly not that bad in the dining hall, and certainly not terrible enough to warrant the (possibly even worse) experience of cooking in a communal kitchen.",

People typically like Cosi, but I have never had a good item from there. For Starbucks, do not get any premade item *ever* they will give you food poisoning, but their prepared drinks are good, it's typical Starbucks things. For the main Caf, the Pasta Bar, Beef Barley Soup, BBQ Night, Meatloaf, and Chocolate Chip Pancakes for the morning are great, as well as the waffle maker. Stay away from the breakfast meats, they don't taste like meat, and unless you're vegan, stay away from the vegan section, and stay away from True Balance unless you have major allergies or no other choice for things that taste good. Beware all caf chicken unless it's diced, as it may be undercooked, and always check your salad for bugs. Everything else is decent.\n\nEdit: As to your question about the communal kitchen, my Freshman year one always reeked, and I've had beer cans hit my head while cooking in my sophomore year one. Granted, they weren't aiming for me but for the trash and it's hilarious in retrospect but still not the best experience. Also, there's only one per dorm, so get used to hauling your kitchen implements back and forth.",

If you buy a lot of perishable food, you\u2019ll attract bugs. The kitchens also tend to be dirty because college students are messy.

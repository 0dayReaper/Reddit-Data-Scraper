It's definitely way better culture-wise (and that's coming from a woc), so I think it's a great idea to transfer. \n\nMy roommate at lc last year transferred from Rose Hill to LC, and I think that process is much harder, but there are plenty of empty rooms at RH that I don't think you'll have too much of a problem! Its just a form on the website, I think? IDK. But good luck!",

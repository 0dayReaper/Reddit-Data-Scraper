Does anyone have experience with this internship program as it does cost around $4k (w/o housing) and the fact that I have not seen anyone talk about this program other than Fordham's own website, I'm considering whether it is worth it or not.\n\nHere: [https://www.fordham.edu/summer-session/special-programs/new-york-city-summer-internship-program/](https://www.fordham.edu/summer-session/special-programs/new-york-city-summer-internship-program/)",

            "comment": "TL/DR $4,080 for the 4 credit seminar cost. Fordham charges $1,020 per credit x 4 = $4,080. The seminar meets once a week on Mondays from 6-9:45. There are required readings, discussions, and a reflection about the internship experience. Join handshake and set up an appointment with Holly Young or Kevin Moncayo to work on your resume and begin your internship search. Apparently, it seems they help you secure an internship through their ongoing list of companies. Deadline to cancel housing is May 15. Deadline to drop internship seminar is May 31. It doesn\u2019t state if you\u2019re refunded for the course or housing deposit. The only way I see this as a benefit is if you land a paid internship and earn more than the cost you laid out (including housing). Then, you\u2019ll have internship experience on your resume, 4 credits that hopefully satisfy a core requirement, and maybe a few extra bucks in your pocket. \n\nI did some digging last year and found this buried somewhere. I didn\u2019t do it. Just got an internship on my own. Essentially, you\u2019re paying Fordham to take a class. There is a one credit course for $1,020 and you earn one credit. Don\u2019t see anything anywhere that guarantees you\u2019ll be hired, which is why you should email one of the two people below. It would be sus if you drop the seminar on or before the deadline and you aren\u2019t refunded. Scammy. \n\nWho is eligible for the Summer in the City Program?\nThis program is designed for undergraduates at Fordham and other universities. All registrants must have completed at least their first\u00a0year of college, and they must be eligible to work in the United States. There is a suggested grade point average of 3.0.\u00a0\n\nA vital part of the internship program is the required four-credit Internship Seminar (SOCI 4900), which allows students to share and compare their experiences as interns and assess their own career goals. The course introduces students to the world of work with an emphasis on leadership development and management skills. The class credits are transferable pending your university's approval. https://www.fordham.edu/summer-session/special-programs/new-york-city-summer-internship-program/\n\nDO THIS!

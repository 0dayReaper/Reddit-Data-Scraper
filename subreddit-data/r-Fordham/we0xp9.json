    "postText": "i keep seeing people shitting on fordham dining (not here for the most part but just in general) but it\u2019s genuinely not bad food, it\u2019s just college dining and I\u2019m saying this as a vegetarian. Fordham had serious dining issues a few years ago but has since switched providers. \n\nAramark as a company has serious worker\u2019s rights problems which is another issue, but the food served at Fordham is largely perfectly fine and the food service workers are fantastic.\n\ngood luck incoming freshmen!! &lt;3",

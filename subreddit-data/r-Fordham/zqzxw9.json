    "postText": "i received a full-tuition scholarship and admission to the honors program at RH. i really love fordham, but the cost of room &amp; board is too high for my family to afford &amp; i need to go loan-free. does anyone have tips on getting the cost down, maybe closer to 10k/yr?\n\nbonus questions: is it difficult to become an RA? are upperclassmen-only housing options for sophomores too or just juniors &amp; seniors?",

Rising seniors get first pick, followed by juniors, followed by freshman and the slots fill up fast. It would be extremely unusual to get upperclassmen housing as a sophomore.",

Res life treats RAs awful (if you get a good resident director you may get off easy) but it is much better than paying an absurd amount for housing. It\u2019s semi competitive so get in good with your rd/ras and/or other building rd\u2019s early on to up your chances and get involved in things on campus that you think can build your resume to appeal more to the position. It\u2019s literally all favoritism which sucks but if you can work the system and emphasize your financial situation, you have a good shot!",

Only with my Spanish course, I kept getting the error message and immediately emailed my advisor and that course sat open for 3 days until her and the head of the language department finally did something and the course was full\u2026 no I\u2019m waitlisted and praying because the only open courses are impossible with my schedule. Hope your problem got resolved lol",

    "postText": "Fordham administration's handling of this year's commencement ceremony was a complete embarrassment and totally unprofessional to say the least. The weather forecast all week predicted that it would rain on Saturday and yet administration refused to move it inside. And when it started to pour during the diploma ceremonies, everyone started to rush the stage to try to get their diploma first, resulting in total chaos. There was just a complete lack of crowd control and planning on Fordham's part. It was also an extremely disappointing ending for the Class of 2023, who deserved better than what Fordham gave them.",

Some Parents couldn\u2019t get in to see their kids bc of overcrowding. Guessing that is why they were so hell bent on having it outside..",

I went to my girlfriend's graduation at Pace last week and I had a better time there than my actual graduation where I had to walk across the stage holding an umbrella while my ass and entire body was sopping wet. Oh, not to mention the person who called my name was a professor that was reported this past semester. Hilarious. Those calls begging for money in the coming months will go straight to voicemail.",

What a horrible decision to keep everything outside and the least they could do was put a tent up but they didn\u2019t even bother with that. I don\u2019t blame anyone for bringing umbrellas but you couldn\u2019t see anything unless you were in the first couple of rows. No screens to look at, nothing. I\u2019m glad some schools were able to go inside for their diploma ceremony, but the FCRH diploma ceremony was honestly the most miserable thing I\u2019ve had to sit through.",

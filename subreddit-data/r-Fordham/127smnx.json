    "postText": "Hi everyone!  I am currently a Fordham PCS undergrad student, and I am wondering if there would be any benefits to matriculating as a normal Fordham LC undergrad.  Has anyone done this, or know someone who has?  I am mostly wondering if I would be eligible for more financial aid.  But I also recognize that the cost per credit for Fordham LC is about double that of PCS, so maybe it balances out.  Thanks in advance!",

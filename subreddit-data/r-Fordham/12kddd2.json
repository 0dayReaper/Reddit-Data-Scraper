            "comment": "Hey, I'm currently a second-semester freshman at Fordham majoring in CompSci. I had little to no experience in the field before coming to Fordham but so far I haven't had any major struggles with the classes. The only Comp Sci class I took in my first semester was Comp Sci I, and right I'm taking Comp Sci II and Discrete Structures. I should also note that Calculus is required for a CS major at Fordham, and that's usually taken in the first semester, but I had AP credits for that. Next semester it's looking like I'm going to take Discrete Structures II, Data Structures, and Data Communication and Networking. Beyond those, the other CS major classes I know of are Computer Organization, Data Base, Algorithms, Theory of Comp, and Operating Systems. All the professors I've had in my CompSci classes have been good to great, too. Overall, I would say the experience thus far has been very manageable, and I came into it with minimal experience so if you have any significant amount of experience before coming into your first semester you should be fine. As far as scholarships, I don't know of any for CS specifically. I was given one for overall academic performance.  \n\n\nGood luck with your college experience!",

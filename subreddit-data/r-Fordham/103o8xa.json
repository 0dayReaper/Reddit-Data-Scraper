    "postText": "Hey i applied to Fordham university Lincoln center undecided major  a couple of days ago and do not  have the best gpa and didn\u2019t summit test scores after i applied i found out i got a internship at a local real estate company should i inform the colleges i applied too specifically Fordham because it\u2019s my number one choice. I do not have the best gpa  in general will this boost my application? If so how do i write to my admissions officer that i got a internship.\nThanks in advance!",

I looked at Fordham courses through DegreeWorks and noticed courses that do not have anyone teaching them. There is a course, in particular, I am interested in, and I wanted to know if it can be taught again if other students and I want it as well? I know we will probably have to talk to the department heads, but I was just curious if anyone has any experience with this type of stuff. This would be an elective for my major.\n\n\nYes, I know some courses are not taught every semester; this course looks like it has not been taught in a while though.",

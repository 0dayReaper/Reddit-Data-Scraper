    "postText": "A friend of mine is a bio major at Fordham (not premed). She was valedictorian in high school w/ a 4.3 gpa. She\u2019s not doing well at all this sem and she just shared w me her syllabus for Chem II. \n\nThe grading curve as per the syllabus will always default the average number grade to C+. Isnt this super unfair? So if I get a 90 but the average grade is 80 so that is C+ is my 90 not an A? Am I missing something?\n\nHas it always been like this? Are there other courses that grade like this?",

I've never had an issue with that, or heard any one else having any issues. \n\nthere's a curve bc usually there are hundreds of students in these courses, so the average is usually very low.",

They\u2019re also normalized so that the further up you are from the median grade, the more curved your grade is. As someone else mentioned, the average is never ever in the 80s.\n\nBut yes, Chem I and II are notoriously weed out courses, more so than Organic I and II. The GPA of a Fordham bio/chem major is \u2014 in my experience \u2014 much lower than their peers\u2019 GPA at a state school. That kinda sucks when it comes to grad schools because your metrics are skewed.",

Many people think a curve is just adding points to everyone's score. That is not the case...a curve is norming the grades for the performance in that class (or some other reference set of numbers, e.g. the average over several classes).\n\nIn your example, what letter grade you get for the 90 would depend on the other scores in the class. You could have an average of 80 with very few grades that are 90 or above.",

I know some fellas who came out of Fordham Business (pre-Gabelli re-naming) and they\u2019re doing fabulously with a great network. I think the Gabelli school is just getting better and better - - and will be a top business school in 15 years.  That rise in name recognition will payoff throughout a career.  Being in NYC matters",

The campus is beautiful and the Gabelli student panel in particular impressed us all for their camaraderie and  how well spoken they were. The internship opportunities are many and being in NYC is key. They have the \u201cRam Van\u201d which shuttles students between Rose Hill and Lincoln Center",

If you have a fake, NYC is the best place to be and some of my best memories are during my freshmen year and doing crazy things in the city. School club scene is also very good and overall in most interests. Academically speaking, Gabelli is definitely the better business school, but Pitt definitely has the better network just by sheer volume standards. Gabelli is really good in accounting and banking (some AM and a little PE fresh out too) but isn\u2019t known for consulting. Being located in NYC is the best part while also having a campus that isn\u2019t a concrete jungle is awesome. Work wise, NYC is the best city to kickstart a career and being in the city makes it so much easier to network and go to summits and events. Fordham provides a lot of resources to get jobs and become successful, but it really only matters If you take initiatives and make opportunities for yourself bc Fordham isn\u2019t here to hold your hand but to show you what is our there and help bridge those connections. In the end, I got 4x internship, I was a 3x research assistant, currently in the student managed investment fund where I help manage ~$2 mil, and am working at a bank after I graduate. I\u2019m proud I\u2019m gonna be a gabelli alum and know that in the long run it was probably the best choice out of my options at the time. If you\u2019re interested in transferring, I knew a couple guys transfer to Cornell, some to other east coast schools, and one to UHawaii (who eventually came back, and these are all gabelli freshmen at the time). Play your cards right and you\u2019ll have a good starting block no matter which path you decide to go, just make sure to leverage your time and all resources Fordham offers.",

            "comment": "When I was trying to decide where to go, it came down to Pitt and Fordham for me as well. I chose Fordham for a couple of reasons but you really can\u2019t go wrong between the two schools. Here\u2019s why I chose Fordham:\r  \n\r  \nThere are literally hundreds of companies that recruit out of Fordham. Fordham has a huge alumni network and most alums make a real effort to hire more Fordham students. As a finance major I went through the investment banking recruiting cycle and and all of the bulge bracket banks (i.e. JP Morgan, Barclays, Credit Suisse, etc) all recruit aggressively out of Fordham. If you're more interested in the Big4/consulting track, most of the major firms actively seek out Fordham students too. I also know of alums who got hired in house by big companies (Disney, Apple, Cartier, and startups) to do corporate finance.\r  \n\r  \nAs for the social scene, its mostly based around the bars. There are 4 or 5 bars around the Fordham area that are all packed at night. Most don't require IDs to get in so you don't have to worry about that (although a fake is nice to have for clubbing and partying in Manhattan). Additionally, on Friday and Saturday nights there are dozens of house parties right off campus. It is very easy to meet new people and there is always something to do. Some people on College Confidential talk shit about the Fordham social scene but they were probably nerds with no friends lol. I literally don\u2019t know a single person who didn\u2019t find their \u201cgroup\u201d here. There\u2019s also been a lot of school spirit the last couple of years as Fordham football went to the CFS playoffs and Fordham basketball finished 2nd in the A10. There are tailgates every Saturday during football season and the Fordham bball student section was nuts. Our sports aren\u2019t going to come close to an ACC team but it was a fun season.\r  \n\r  \nHopefully this helps. Feel free to PM if you have any additional questions!",

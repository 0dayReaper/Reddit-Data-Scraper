Are there a lot of gay guys? My brother told me there's probably not because it is a Jesuit school. Thanks very much!",

There are some edgy redpillers unfortunately but just surround yourself with the right people and you wont deal with them.\n\nThere is this problem of girls (especially white ones) who fetishize gay men and try to be friends with as clout or whatever superficial value they get. So don\u2019t just surround yourself with any right people, but good and genuine ones who want to be friends with you and not invade your space and community.",

The Major requirements for any stem field are ridiculous and take almost the entire time you\u2019re in school, so while it is possible to double major in two stem related fields,doing so in two unrelated fields would be hard",

STEM majors have a LOT of required courses at any school, but if you add in Fordham\u2019s core it becomes nearly impossible. Comp sci is probably the best shot for eliminating coursework because the labs aren\u2019t as long as chem/bio/physics.\n\nA minor is probably doable if you start early.",

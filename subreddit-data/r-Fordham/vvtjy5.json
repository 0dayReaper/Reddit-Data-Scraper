            "comment": "COVID kind of really messed up a lot of what you would consider the natural progression of things like this (study abroad, moving of campus, etc.)\n\nSo Pre-COVID: Students would study abroad usually in one of three semesters; second semester sophomore, or first/second semester junior year. Because it was so spaced out you\u2019d miss out on some of your friends but you\u2019d still have a lot that are hanging around and planning on studying abroad later.\n\nDuring COVID: Last year second semester was the first real reintroduction of the study abroad program. The Class of 2022 didn\u2019t really study abroad cause it was their senior year and didnt want to miss it, but for the junior class (which I was) a tremendous amount studied abroad second semester. \n\nThere were either over 200 or 300 (cant remember) people alone at the London program with pretty much all of them being juniors let alone all the other programs that had opened back up again like Spain, France, etc. \n\nStaying on campus, you could really feel the absence of a lot of juniors and people you knew (especially the more people you knew). For example my really close friend group was a group of like 11 but only 6 of us were still here second semester. But at the same time you get a lot closer with the friends that are still there and become a lot closer with people you kinda knew already (in my experience).\n\nPost COVID: I don\u2019t know if it will go back to pre (pretty sure it will, so it won\u2019t be like a mass exodus), but we\u2019ll have to wait and see. It might be like moving off campus which used to be only seniors and juniors but like last year there were freshmen and sophomores moving off during the year and moving into next year. which will probably hold true for the upcoming year as well.",

I majored in journalism.\n\nThe journalism program at Fordham is really underrated, I had current NYT editors, NYT best sellers, and current NBC/ABC employees, for professors. Fordham has great connections with many NYC news agencies, and many of my classmates had articles in major publications before graduation. \n\nI really think the access I had to notable internships, and the rigorous and comprehensive writing curriculum added a ton to my law school applications.",

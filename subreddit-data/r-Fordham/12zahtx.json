    "postText": "Hey so although I already paid the deposit for Fordham, I was wondering how the party scene is like here. I\u2019ve heard mixed opinions on it. I also got accepted to Syracuse and UIUC where I know they have greek life and plenty of parties. I chose fordham because since it is a smaller school, i felt like i would get more one on one help with the professors but i heard they don\u2019t do much. So now i don\u2019t really know what to do\u2026 pls help",

            "comment": "Hey - I transferred in to Fordham last fall and have felt very minimal attachment to the university/social scene so my response might be a little bitter. But, it's mostly a bar school.. there 5-6 local bars that Fordham students go to on the weekends.. I personally haven't had a night at a Fordham bar where I was like \"WOW that was so much fun\",  it's very average in my experience. However, I have a lot of friends who really enjoy the bars here and find themselves going out every weekend or even weeknights. These bars also do get expensive: there's always at least a $10 cover charge and drinks will cost you an arm and a leg so that's also why I don't go out. There's the occasional house party/darty in the neighborhood off campus which can be very hit or miss.. I probably don't know enough people/care to know enough people to make my experience going out here enjoyable but regardless I'd rather take the subway for $2.75 and go out somewhere in the city but a lot of people enjoy it here. If you came as a freshman, you'd know a lot more people and would have fun if you like local neighborhood bars but the city is always a great option if you think you'd prefer that as well.",

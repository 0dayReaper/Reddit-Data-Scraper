    "postText": "I\u2019m a hs junior right now with about a 3.8 unweighted gpa (my school doesn\u2019t use the weighted scale ever) I earned one C sophomore year but only in one semester and it fell under extenuating circumstances. I\u2019ve taken 6 honors classes so far, and 5 aps, I\u2019ve got a couple leadership positions at and outside my school, but am enrolled in a good amount of clubs and honor societies as just a member (English honors society, Spanish honors society, and regular). Since Im a junior I don\u2019t have an SAT score to share, but im taking the December 3rd one and have been enrolled in a free prep class for it so hopefully that goes well and I can submit a score next year. \nI understand that Fordham is pretty competitive for admissions so I was wondering if anyone could give their opinion on my chances. \n(Everyone here is so helpful :) thanks for your time)",

I got accepted early action (still waiting for the financial aid response tho :)), and my school doesn't have Honors or APs nor did I take the SAT or ACT so I think you got pretty good chances. Don't stress much. You got this\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

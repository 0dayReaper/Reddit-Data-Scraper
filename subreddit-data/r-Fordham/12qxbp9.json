            "comment": "\"Join us for a screening of the movie All the Ships at Sea, followed by a talkback panel featuring the movie\u2019s director, Dan Sallitt, along with professors Kathryn Reklis (theology) and Ayala Fader (anthropology). The panel will be moderated by Communication and Media Studies professor Ashar Foley. All the Ships at Sea is a delightful and inspiring tale about faith, truth, introspection, and the psychology of religious experience, as observed through the relationship between two sisters.\n\nWe sincerely hope that you will be able to join us for what promises to be a wonderful evening of reflection about the sources of human belief. The event is co-hosted with Fordham\u2019s Comparative Literature program.\n\nThis event is open to alumni, faculty/staff, homepage, students, and the public.\"",

            "comment": "I am by no means an expert on this, as I'm staying on campus, but to my knowledge, it is all apartments. There's a few buildings on Arthur Ave you might be able to call \"houses\" on a technicality, but you'd realistically not find anything apart from a unit. \n\nFordham RH offers three off campus buildings a short walk from campus with apartments students can stay in, not sure what they're like. Most students find off campus housing with third party landlords though. Belmont Reality and LandSeAir are the two major ones to my knowledge. Sometimes students who are friends with graduating upperclassmen will make arrangements with the landlord to move into the apartment the upperclassmen leave before the apartment goes public again.\n\nMost students will make the decision whether to continue to live on campus or move off campus during spring semester of sophomore year and will form groups,  look at apartments, and secure leases during that time for the fall semester of junior year and/or summer internships in the city. You will see some people decide to move out directly after freshman year and some people decide to move out after junior year as well though.",

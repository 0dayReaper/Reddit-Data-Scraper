How does Fordham dining work? Does it provide food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?\n3. Do students have to prepare their own food in the dorm?\n4. How can I save money (from eating and cooking...)?\n5. Is McKeon Hall air-conditioned?\n\nThank you for answering!",

Does it provide food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?\r  \n\r  \n\\- There are 5 places to get food. The dining hall, ram cafe, argo tea, schmeltzers, and SVK. The dining hall and ram cafe serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Argo tea is similiar to starbucks and has some food options like muffins and sandwiches. Schmeltzers has burgers and sandwiches. SVK is Vietnamese asian fusion resturant. The hours are different for every single place but most places are open at 7:30am and close at 8pm\n\nDo students have to prepare their own food in the dorm?\n\n\\- If you live in mckeon there is no kitchen so it would be hard to make your own food if you don't have a mini-fridge or microwave\n\nHow can I save money (from eating and cooking...)?\n\n\\- Eating at resturants gets very expensive and adds up over time so I would just avoid it\r\n\n\r  \nIs McKeon Hall air-conditioned?\n\n\\- Yes it is!",

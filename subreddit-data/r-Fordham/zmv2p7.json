What do I do now?  \n\n\nEdit: I checked my submitted Fordham application and it says, \"I am a National Merit Semifinalist or Finalist\". Now I'm thinking that I didn't make the cutoff for scholarship past being National Merit. Their website says, \"The full-tuition award renewable for four years. All students who are designated as Semifinalists by the National Merit Recognition Program \\[...\\] will be considered for this scholarship. Of this pool of candidates last year, 71% of designees received the award.\"",

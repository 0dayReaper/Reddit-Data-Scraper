I\u2019ve tried going to clubs but it seems like people come there with friends they\u2019ve already made and then everyone leaves once the meeting is over. Same thing with classes. I cant go out because I have no one to go with so I can\u2019t rely on that either. It\u2019s hard because I feel like everyone already has their group and isn\u2019t open to meeting new people. Am I just not trying hard enough or is there something i\u2019m missing?",

            "comment": "I feel like someone asks this at least every month or two on this sub haha. You're definitely not alone. And for the record, as a senior, there are a lot of things I like about Fordham, but I do suspect smaller colleges and state colleges offer better environments for forming friendships. \n\nAnyways, here are some ideas - \n\n\\- depending on how small and/or rigid in scheduling your major is, you're very likely going to run into a few of the same students over and over. Meaning that making friends from classes will be a little easier every year. Even right now, don't be afraid to go ahead and introduce yourself to a classmate that seems friendly, change where you're sitting, make small talk about the class, etc. Ask her/him if they want to do something over the weekend, worst that can happen is they make up some excuse and you move on. \n\n\\- Put yourself out there, try going to RA events if you live on campus, try going to the special events that some of the clubs, especially the cultural ones, host. Yes it can be awkward being by yourself, but you never know - sometimes you'll see someone you recognize from class or your dorm. \n\n\\- If you're at all athletic you could try intramurals? If you don't have a team, sign up for a league as a free agent and maybe a team needing an extra player will contact you. \n\n\\- you could also try the campus ministry retreats, which push you and other participants together over a whole weekend. Some have a heavy spiritual focus but some do not and are more casual. If you're Catholic, Campus Ministry has a whole long list of special and regular events they put on. There are active clubs for Muslims and Protestants too.\n\n\\- Enjoy New York City! Dive into what you love whether it's parks, or food, or art, or history, and so on. Or find a new interest to dive into, maybe a hobby you always wanted to explore but never had time for. You're honestly not defined by your friendships, and if you have trouble finding friendships, don't automatically assume it's your fault.",

Someone friendly you're in a group project with?  \n\n\nHonestly try to text them one weekend if they're going out and that you're looking for a pregame. Once you have an in, it'll probably be easy to meet people and make friends organically",

If you\u2019re part of any social clubs, feel free to ask the eboard to help plan an event aimed at helping people meet new people\n\nBecome a board member of a club or org or start one\n\nJoin Greek life or do an intramural\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to not make friends when doing a sport\n\nAsk for help with things\u2026 like say you\u2019re in a. Class and you\u2019re confused, ask a fellow classmate, did you get that, can you explain it to me? Then you get to talking and go from there if you like their vibe\n\nGet an on campus job if possible, that\u2019ll get you talking to lots of people",

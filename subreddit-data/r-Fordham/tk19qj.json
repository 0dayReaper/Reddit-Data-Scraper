    "postText": "CSC is arguably the hardest dorm to get into on campus. I\u2019m a rising junior and I know the chances are slightly slim, so I want to know what i can do to optimize them. Currently have 4 people to live with but we are wondering if we should look for a 5th. Is there more of one type of apartment than the other? \n\nALSO: if anyone has the floor plan for room selection PLEASE send it",

    "postText": "Hey Guys, I am sooo confused about the loans. The loan limit from Fordham is 20k, which is definitely not going to be enough for my MS. I also applied for a loan through Fafsa so not sure if I would have to have two loans??? Or use one or the other. I have never applied for student loans before so this whole process is extremely confusing. Also why would there be a 20k limit if the actual tuition is much higher. Can anyone give any tips? \ud83d\ude2d",

Its through the government and you should be able to take out as much as the designated cost of attendance by your institution. This does require a credit check to make sure there are no major abnormalities. \n\nI would really recommend trying to go through this route before exploring private loans which usually have steeper interest rates and with no option for loan forgiveness.",

    "postText": "I got accepted as an Undecided major at FCRH, but I originally applied as a Finance major at Gabelli Rose Hill. I was wondering how hard it was to internally transfer as I tried changing my majors after I got accepted and they declined it. Since I am an undecided major, what would be the process of transferring to Gabelli? Gabelli didn\u2019t have an undecided option, and I really think changing my major to Undecided helped me get accepted here. I\u2019m 100% sure I\u2019m going to go into Finance as well, so if they\u2019re not going to let me transfer than I don\u2019t know what to do.",

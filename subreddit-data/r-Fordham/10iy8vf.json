Especially if you're traveling with friends/family.\n\nLook for an airbnb. It will give you more privacy and the prices are usually more fair for what you're getting. You might even find one for a great deal if you don't mind spreading your search outside of the Bronx.",

Go with a hotel. Safer and less likely to pull the rug out from under you.",

    "postText": "So, I was just accepted into Fordham and they offered me a hefty sum of money (like enough to cover 2/3 of the total costs) and I was wondering if this offer outweighs the negatives. I'm torn because I was also accepted into UVM (who also offered up a fair amount of money), and I've heard some consistent complaints about Fordham, and almost none regarding UVM. I could really use some input here as I really don't want to go through the trouble of transferring down the line.",

            "comment": "i\u2019m also thinking about fordham vs uvm. there are a lot of factors to consider including your major, what fordham campus you would attend, your interests, and overall personality. uvm seems to be a great place for outdoorsy and friendly people and they seem to have fairly good academics in most subjects. also uvm and fordham rh have true college campuses with a similar number of undergrads but fordham lc is more of a few buildings surrounding a quad in the middle of manhattan.",

The campus is pretty, it is gated though because it is in the bronx. I think location is a big con of the rose hill campus. The campus is also in my opinion kinda small but thats just my opinion. There are a couple college bars on arther ave that you can get into with just a fordham ID. If you arent in gabelli there are an EXCESSIVE amount of core classes you need to take. If you ever want to visit the city you can take metro north to grand central (about 15 dollars i think) or the ram van to the LC campus. Taking the subway is also an option but the station is like a 6-10 min walk. Fordham is know for bad food but any time ive eaten there is hasnt been too bad but I have also heard some horror stories (bugs in food etc). I dont know anything about the housing honestly. Hope this helped! Best of luck making your decision",

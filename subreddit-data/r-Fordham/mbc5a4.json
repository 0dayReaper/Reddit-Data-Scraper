I instantly notice that other college campuses have a livelier school spirit while the fun at fordham seems to be concentrated at bars and house parties.",

I remember coming in to Fordham as a transfer student back in 2018 in the cold and dark of January and literally knowing nobody, because my decision to attend was last minute too and I did not go to orientation.  It was one of the lowest points in my life tbh. I remember being horribly depressed, but I met a lot of people through clubs and discord nowadays.\n\nYou should totally join ACE (Asian Cultural Exchange) at Fordham! [https://discord.gg/wvDCXpcV](https://discord.gg/wvDCXpcV)  they are some of the chillest people I have met, and I met my best friends from there. They have a discord too. With COVID its really hard of course to meet new people, but try going on retreats, maybe create a discord and invite some people from class, not only is this way a good way to meet them but also get help in the class! oh and add me on insta :) @ryan1997123 (I am a senior btw)",

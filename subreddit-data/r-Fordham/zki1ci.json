Have they made any steps to improve meal options?\n\n(and how feasible are self-cooked meals?)",

            "comment": "I can only speak for my first semester of freshman year, but the food is not bad. It\u2019s by no means gourmet, but there are good options on campus. There are also healthy options. Cosi (similar to Panera) has a wide range of salads, sandwiches, soups, rice bowls, and pizzas that are pretty satisfying. Boar\u2019s Head/PODs is the most consistent place on campus. You really can\u2019t beat a made to order sandwich with Boar\u2019s Head quality lunch meats; it\u2019s definitely my go-to. Urban Kitchen (although it\u2019s a hike from the freshman dorms) has your typically greasy American favorites and also a smoothie bar, salad bar, mac n cheese bar, and a rice bowl bar as well. They also serve great chicken wraps. Dagger John\u2019s has sushi (that in my experience, has been safe to eat) and poke, along with a variety of Asian-inspired hot dishes like bao buns. It isn\u2019t consistently great, but it is usually pretty good. The only place on campus that isn\u2019t typically good is the cafeteria. The salad bar is fine, and breakfast is usually good. I can only speak for myself, but none of the food has made me sick yet. I will say, I was a little \u201cbacked up\u201d the first week or two, but that could just be from the stress of the adjustment to college in general. I would assume that Fordham being ranked worst is probably solely based off the caf alone. Overall the food is a solid B-, IMO.",

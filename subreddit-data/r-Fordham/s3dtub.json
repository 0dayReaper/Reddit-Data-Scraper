The real message should be: You didn't equip your classrooms to protect us and allow a hybrid option, even though we pay skyrocketing tuition every year.  Make that happen or we start making more noise (protests, local media, etc).",

This is exactly what an endowment is meant for and should be used ASAP to give students who need it an option. It\u2019s finances vs. the actual well-being of students.",

It doesn\u2019t mean each class will be fully remote, and some classes may fully meet in person. But what we want is the option for students to be able to zoom if they want. Fordham says in their emails that they\u2019re \u201cfully prepped\u201d to go online if needed, implying they\u2019re also ready to implement a hybrid format instantaneously. It shouldn\u2019t be a challenge at all.",

Half of the computers also never work to begin with, much less are equipped to handle a hybrid mode. Finally, professors are not trained at all to use computers in this fashion. Fordham\u2019s endowment can fund new equipment, computers and trainings without harming their financial status as an institution.",

I've been to every campus many times and every classroom in RH, LC, and Westchester has this tech as far as I've seen. Also, where are you getting this stat of half the podium computers not working? Isn't there a hot phone in every classroom to go with that technology that puts professors right in contact with the team that oversees the tech if an issue arises? And I'm assuming you're not faculty, because they are offered training and one-on-one guidance each semester. It's up to them if they want to do it, though.",

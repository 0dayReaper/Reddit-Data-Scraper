    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\n I'm planning on being on the Pre-med track and I'm having a difficult time choosing a school. I'm between Fordham LC and CCNY. The financial aid scholarship I received from Fordham is GREAT and for CCNY, I don't have to pay at all. However, my issue isn't money.\n\n I heard a lot of different opinions about pre-med at CCNY and Fordham LC and I'm not sure which school to pick. CCNY seems very science and engineering based and I heard that for Fordham I need to go to the Rose Hill location for some of my classes. What kind of opportunities did you gain? And did you feel supported going to that school if you were on the Pre-med track? Please tell me your experience if you attended any (Or both)! \n\nThank you :)",

            "comment": "Very few pre-meds go to LC because all of the labs (Chem and Bio freshman year, Orgo/Physics/Anatomy/Microbio after that) are at RH. Fordham prepared me well with its science curriculum, but it wasn\u2019t anything particularly special in the pre-med aspect. I would go where you have to pay the least and use the saved money to apply for/pay for med school. \n\nGood luck!",

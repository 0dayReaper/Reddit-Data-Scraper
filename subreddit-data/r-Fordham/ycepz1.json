I got deferred then accepted with $30k scholarship (no FAFSA) \n6 AP courses, 3.6 gpa. 1180 sat (applied without it) All A\u2019s senior year, had clubs and captain of basketball team.\n\nWrote a great essay. What\u2019s interesting in an essay? Talk about your challenges. The adversity you\u2019ve overcame etc. BS it if you have to. College system is kind of a joke so just BS the application to make you look the best\n\nYou should get in just fine. If you\u2019re looking at Gabelli that\u2019s a little harder. You\u2019ll get in just fine. Apply and hope you choose fordham",

    "postText": "Okay, so I realized a month in that I don\u2019t want to continue being a pre-med bio major. I can see myself being overwhelmed in the future and I don\u2019t think I want to be stuck in school for the next couple of years.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s the only career I\u2019ve had in mind for the last couple of years so now I\u2019m absolutely lost.\n\nI want to switch majors into something more flexible where I can make a good amount of money after undergrad and not absolutely hate my job.\n\nDoes anyone want to share their experience with their majors and how it\u2019s going for them? ( I\u2019m a freshman btw)\n\nAny advice would be appreciated, thank you!",

They switched to a variety of other majors, including political science and media &amp; communications. Few went on to law school and have been incredibly successful. Others studied economics and pursued careers in consulting. \n\nMy best advice is to switch to a major that Fordham is better known for, such as business or political science. I\u2019m not quite sure what the obstacles are transferring into Gabelli, but Fordham is a great business school, and if you want to extract the maximum from Fordham academically, I would seek out a course of study that Fordham is known for. \n\nFor your reference I was a chemistry major at Fordham and now I work as a management consultant.",

In LC, you need to have taken calculus.\n\nBefore you fill out the change major request form, you have to get in contact with your dean/advisor. They'll help you with the process. It's much more difficult to change schools then just majors within Fordham College. There's no guarantee you'll get approved or accepted into the business school.\n\nLuckily, you are a freshman (in first semester I assume), meaning you shouldn't have too many problems catching up in classes. The business school has a different core curriculum than Fordham College, so the later you switch, the harder it will be to graduate on time (in 4 years). You may need to take an extra semester or summer classes.\n\nBest of luck!!",

It's got everything. Plus, in NYC. \n\nHow much tuition did you rack up trying to go here. Thinking about applying for PhD, or master's and just need to prepare for the mental fact that I might be in debt for the rest of my life if I get accepted.",

If you think going to fordham will help catapult you into your career route, then yeah sure it\u2019s worth the debt, but only marginally. Going 240-260k in debt for the same degree isn\u2019t worth it unless you\u2019re getting paid 6 figures as soon as you graduate. If you\u2019re getting a useless degree that\u2019s going to pay you 30-90k a year, it\u2019s not worth it and just take the plunge into state colleges. If you want to pursue something like, say, finance, going to gabelli can push you into some internships and jobs that other schools like your state school might not be able to provide. I\u2019m gonna be about 130-140k in debt but I hope to pursue high finance which will HOPEFULLY land me in the upper 100k range. So again, it\u2019s almost always dependent on what you\u2019re trying to pursue and how likely it is for you to get into that field.",

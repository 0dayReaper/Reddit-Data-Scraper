Maybe just try and get some elective classes complete for the semester abroad if you can\u2019t fulfill major/core requirements there. You can also use summer classes to fill in the gaps for your requirements. If you need certain classes to graduate that semester, you may not be able to go to London without delaying your graduation and should have planned better earlier. Sorry if that is the case. Good luck!",

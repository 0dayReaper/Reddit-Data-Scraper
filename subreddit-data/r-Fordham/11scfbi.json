    "postText": "Hello, I just got accepted to Fordham, but I was wondering if Fordhams value award also includes CSS? This might be a dumb question but I just want to make sure. For the total scholarship and grants, I received $45,141 but for net direct charge it says $16,839\u2026does that mean I have to pay over $16,000 dollars for each year? Is it possible to ask for more money \ud83d\ude43",

            "comment": "Sounds like a nice financial package, I wish I got that. And yes, $16,000 is what you would owe per year. It's possible to ask for more money, but unless you have a fantastic, and I mean straight from heaven, signed from Christ himself reason why they should give you even a cent more, don't expect anything. If you want more off, I'd recommend looking for external scholarships, because you likely won't get any more internal scholarship increases. Good luck.",

However, I'm being honest when I say this, it's not an easy thing to convince the administration of, as they will likely say something along the lines of \"what makes you worthy of not dealing with (a comparatively small) debt which is tens of thousands less than what most Fordham students pay. Most college students have to face some debt, and this isn't a particularly unique case.\" They will likely say they have been as generous as they can given the circumstances. Good luck though, surely couldn't hurt to try.",

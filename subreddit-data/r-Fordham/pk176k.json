    "postText": "Uh rose hill resident freshman here, I heard from public safety there are ppl who contacted COVID 19 on campus. Some ppl on my floor has symptoms (coughing hard, sore throat, runny nose). They said testing only opens this Thursday and we\u2019d have to wait until then to get ppl tested. Is there any way to get ppl tested asap because i don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overreacting but it\u2019s pretty worrying I don\u2019t want my college experience to be ruined",

Zero details on isolation. Masks aren\u2019t enforced strictly. Vaccinated people can and still DO get Covid. Look at other universities, for example Saint Lawrence university. 150 cases since the start of school. So dumb",

Wash ur hands, eat and sleep well, and ur body should be able to handle it. I'd keep an eye out for symptoms just in case, but again, you should be good.\n\nAlso remember that other illnesses still exist! I got pretty sick in June with not-covid, but it presented kinda similar. From the symptoms you mentioned it could just be like a sinus infection.\n\nStay safe fam \ud83d\udc4d",

I just think people shouldn\u2019t put their guards down too soon and be careless just because most ppl are vaccinated, it might compromise those who are unvaxxed due to unavoidable reasons too. Me and my roommates are vaxxed, but we are still very concerned about covid. Im on 4th floor fyi. Hoping it isn\u2019t covid",

This is in the context of having numerous colleges in the vicinity, including a few Ivies. Would the chances of Fordham student getting an internship or volunteering lowered by students from other higher-ranked colleges applying to same positions?",

I've never heard of grade curving either, unless you mean GPA which is on a 4.00 scale.\n\nAs for opportunities, it depends on what you want to go into. Fordham excels at liberal arts, law, and business, but are less good at stuff like computer science.\n\nIf you're going for a job in business, Fordham is great. It might actually give you a leg up over the Ivy Leagues because they got connections with and alumni in the big boy companies like Big 4 accounting and investment banks. They've got recruiting events, coffee chats, and alumni networking too.\n\nSo long as the career you want does not heavily rely on academia, Fordham should not drag you down.",

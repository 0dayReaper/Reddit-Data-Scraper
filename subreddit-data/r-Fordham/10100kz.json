    "postText": "Guys!!! I have a quick question, fordham supplement is asking students to write a time we challenged ourselves or stepped out of our comfort zone in order to be an advocate for our community\u2026and then they basically say \u201cthat we would not find anywhere else in your application\u201d, I want to talk about my reasonings as to why I did community service at a place but I put that in my activity section (BUT I didn\u2019t specify the place I did community service since Fordham doesn\u2019t ask for my resume so I believe they just check the activity section), can I still write about it? This might be a dumb question but I want to make sure \ud83d\ude2d",

But then I had the idea to talk about a community service I did during the summer and write the reason as to why I did it (it was mostly because they didn\u2019t have enough teachers, so I really wanted to provide them with help \ud83d\ude0a) but idk if that can be considered an advocate \ud83d\ude15",

Could I take some classes at Lincoln Center? How long is the Ram Van commute from RH to LC? Commute using subway?",

Schedule LC classes so that you don\u2019t have to travel during rush hour so that the ram van only takes about 35 mins. However, if you do have to commute during rush, the D train runs express in the bronx in the peak direction so it\u2019s like four stops only from LC to RH\u2014super quick!",

Still a bit wary about going to Fordham even though I am committing as of right now, because if I get off the waitlist for UC Davis there is a chance I may go. Visited Fordham last summer but maybe I wasn't in the best mood that day, but I think it was solid. I did really like the greenery though. Of course everything is what you make of it, but if I do end up going to Fordham I'm scared I won't like it--hopefully everything works out in the end",

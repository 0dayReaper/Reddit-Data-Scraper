    "postText": "I'm currently a rising sophomore at Fordham and a bio major who cant pick between information science or journalism. I hate bio and I'm just not good at it, which is why I'm switching out of it. I used to really want to be in the health field but my grades arent good enough which it why I have to switch(still would love to be in it). I also enjoy writing and have sort of a talent for it, but at the same time, it is a dying industry. I know a lot of people say to pick a job you enjoy but I want to have a job where I make enough money to support myself comfortably. Hence why I chose something in tech as there will always be a demand for it, but I also have no experience with coding. IDK what to do since I have to declare my major this upcoming school year and would appreciate any help I can get. Also, if there are any other suggestions, I would love that. Also I plan on minoring in peace and justice studies and cybersecurity no matter what. EDIT: I really like analyzing things and drawing conclusions from them but I also value social interaction to an extent. I would love to utilize writing and some sense of creativity so each day is not the same but also have some sense of routine with a clear goal. I am really interested in the growing tech world and overall want to find a place where I can help people.",

What are some hobbies and activities you have that kinda relate to the basics of a profession? For example i like doing stuff that require problem solving and critical thinking like escape rooms. Find the root and what you feel confident in, then see what professions require that and how much do they require it!! An industry might need an attribute that you have and are good at but it might not be a highly valuable attribute and vice versa.\nTry to break down the problem more. Cant just decide with the little information you are looking at.",

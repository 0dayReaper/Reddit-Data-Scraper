Gabelli also sends a lot of internship opportunities to apply to every week via email and events. It\u2019s just up to the students to take advantage of.",

This will potentially help with your career, social circle, etc.\n\nAs you get further from NY/NJ/CT, the network shrinks rapidly (i.e., folks will be hard-pressed to know what Fordham is outside the tri-state).  \n\nIt's hard to assign a \"value\" to this (IMO, it matters less and less as your career progresses), but it doesn't hurt especially as you're starting a career.",

I got my sophomore and junior banking internships through managing directors who hired exclusively Fordham students for intern roles and I know a lot of friends with similar experiences. Gabelli grads are always happy to help out current students through networking events, coffee chats, and putting fellow Fordham resumes into the right pile. Additionally, our office of professional development is really good and goes out of their way to help students get high level internships and full time job offers within NYC. Outside of NYC, YMMV.",

I got multiple internships through alumni connections.\n\nWhile Fordham alumni are certainly centralized in New York, I\u2019ve stumbled upon alumni working in Hong Kong, Egypt, and Ireland (there\u2019s a relatively large alumni community there), amongst other places. \n\nThe thing about alumni networks is that you have to be actively networking to benefit from them. You might get a leg up from going to the same school, but you won\u2019t get the real benefits until you create a relationship, which being a Ram is a jumping-off point for.",

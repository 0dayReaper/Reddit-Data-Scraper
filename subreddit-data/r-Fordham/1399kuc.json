    "postText": "Hello!\n\nFirst ever Reddit post here! I got into Fordham for an English Master's degree (yay!!) but now I have approximately a zillion questions. I was hoping someone could help. For context, I live in Florida, am 23 years old, and the only things I know about Fordham comes from my friend who attends the law school. I've visited New York a handful of times but nothing of substantial length. The other school I am considering is UVM in Burlington, Vermont. I was accepted into Boston College but felt like it was not the best place for me. Please forgive anything that seems naive or silly.\n\n1) Fordham touts itself as an international school. Is this the case for the graduate programs? In other words, would I have the chance to study abroad as a graduate student? My law school friend goes abroad all the freaking time and I'd love to go too.\n\n2) I will openly admit to being wowed by architecture. The Rose Hill campus is beautiful. Do graduate students get to spend any time on that campus? If not, which campus would an English grad student primarily visit? And do you get the same sense of community as you would at a \"traditional\" university? \n\n3) What's the professional development like? Are internships (relatively) easy to get in New York City? And what type of internships do people get? For example, the GSAS mentions internships at prominent museums and publication companies, but how accurate is this?  I have strong academics but the rest of my resume is suffering, so this is important to me.\n\n4) I've heard that New York City can be very lonely and cutthroat. I've also heard that people are not friendly there. I know that this may not be true, as it feels like a stereotype. Is it easy to make friends in New York City? What's the dating scene like? (For the \"it is what you make it\" people: I'm a \\*very\\* friendly person. When I visited, my friend told me to stop being so friendly and that New Yorkers would be weirded out by it.)\n\n5) Are the professors supportive/are the classes enjoyable? My focus would be modern/contemporary literature, so I enjoy classes in that vein. \n\n6) If you could do it all over again, would you chose Fordham?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank y'all so much! :) Any other input would be appreciated as well.",

            "comment": "Current Junior, but have a few older friends who have graduated and one who is also an English major ;). \n\n1) Firstly, yes it is an international school. I studied abroad in London for an undergrad, but i do know that have some teaching opportunities found here. [https://forever.fordham.edu/s/1362/18/interior.aspx?sid=1362&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=354](https://forever.fordham.edu/s/1362/18/interior.aspx?sid=1362&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=354)\n\n2) The majority of the liberal arts post grad is at the lincoln center campus in NYC so the architecture is not that much of Rose Hill, but you can always visit or even try to see if any courses are offered here. \n\n3) Fordham's Internships are some of the best in my opinion, especially compared to some of the other schools you've mentioned. The alumni culture is amazing and I've had a few friends go on o journalism in NYC or enc up working full time in the city so its more of where you want to be after post-grad. \n\n4) Im originally from NYC so I may be biased, but I would say the city is very keep to yourself. It does get a little lonely, but at the same time, you would definitely find friends through your coursework and sometimes may even meet someone out at some of the restaurants/bars in the city that can be meaningful fun friendships. \n\n5) In my undergrad experience yes, but I'm not too sure about the post graduate, but If you find this helpful, dm me and I can ask my friend/connect you with her to help you out. \n\n6) I def would.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease upvote if this was helpful in any way and good luck on the decision!!",

            "comment": "Psyc grad student, not English.\n\n1. I got one email about studying in London (that may or may not have been sent to all students) and nothing else. There are opportunities for international conferences, but these are not fully funded by the school.\n2. My primary campus is RH. I believe that the primary campus of English grads is too, but I\u2019m not confident in that.\n3. In my field, internships were screwed over after COVID. Most went online and because so highly competitive that they\u2019re not even worth applying for. My department in Fordham lost the recurring internships that were guaranteed to our students during COVID (no one\u2019s fault, the company eliminated nearly all internships during the pandemic) and hasn\u2019t gotten them back. I can\u2019t speak to the English department, but that\u2019s my experience in mine.\n4. NYC can be lonely if you don\u2019t find your tribe. \u201cNot friendly\u201d Is relative\u2026. Strangers most often won\u2019t greet you or offer random conversation\u2026 If you\u2019re accustomed to that, then NYC will strike you as cold. However, if you expect to mind other people\u2019s space, you\u2019ll find that they are very friendly at other times. I\u2019ve never had someone turn me down when I asked for help navigating the public transit system, for instance. The NYC dating scene, like many other places, is largely dominated by apps and those who are jaded by apps and only met people at events. Personally, I always recommend meeting people IRL (even though I do have an app). I suggest using meetup and similar sites to find activities you enjoy and then find someone within that activity.\n5. Honestly, depends on the professor. In my sub-department, they\u2019re great. In the wider psyc department, most are good and a few are terrible. Outside of my department I can\u2019t recommend anyone.\n6. If I could do it again, I might choose a place that already pays a living wage and won\u2019t fight its graduate workers tooth and nail to refuse then basics like enough money to pay for food AND rent, dental and vision insurance, health insurance that doesn\u2019t cost 20% coinsurance on anything that isn\u2019t preventative, protects international students better, and much more. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know that info on UVM, so I can\u2019t say whether it would be better. If they have a graduate student union, ask them what they\u2019re currently fighting for. I think BC is currently denying students unionization, so that\u2019s a bigger problem there.",

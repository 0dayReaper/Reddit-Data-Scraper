(I\u2019m 20 and in my 3rd year of uni.) And what are the best halls for freshmen and upperclass students? :)",

            "comment": "Welcome to Fordham, OP :) \nAre you enrolled in Rose Hill (the Bronx campus) or Lincoln Center (the Manhattan campus)?\n\nIf you are a 3rd yr student at Rose Hill, in my opinion, Campbell Hall and Salice-Conley Hall are the best. They are apartment-style dorms with a kitchen, living room, 2 bathrooms, and some have individual rooms for each roommate in the apartment. The rooms can feel a bit small, but you can always rearrange the furniture so that it feels bigger. You can see the inside of these and all the other Rose Hill dorms here: [RH Residence Halls, Virtual Tours](https://www.fordham.edu/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/virtual-hall-and-room-tours/)\n\nNot too sure about the Lincoln Center dorms, sorry :( but I\u2019m sure they also have the virtual tours for those online!",

                    "comment": "Following what you just commented, I'll just say that although Campell and Salice-Conley are the best, they're extremely competitive and if you still haven't registered for housing at this point, 99.9% you're not gonna get it. I would recommend off-campus housing. They're a little further from campus and a little less safe (since it's off-campus) compared to the dorms, but (1) the off-campus housings have more space and privacy and freedom, (2) you stand a better chance of getting a double room entirely to yourself, and (3) Fordham actually provides resources to make sure that you're safe (like a shuttle that will take you home anytime from 8pm-5am)",

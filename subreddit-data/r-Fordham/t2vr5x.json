As per they're mentioned on there website:\n\"Please note: Unfortunately, we are not able to open the LC Fitness Center under the current New York state guidelines.  Without having designated staff in the center, we are unable to comply with the requirements.  Should the NY state guidelines change, we will re-examine our ability to open the facility at that time.\"",

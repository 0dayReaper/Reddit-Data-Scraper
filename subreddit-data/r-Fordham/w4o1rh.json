Personal favorite spots are Dominick\u2019s (no menus, very solid old school Italian), rigoletto (also Italian) and Estrellita Poblana 3 which i think are some of the best tacos in the city.",

By mid to late afternoon, you'll be on your own!! It's a 3-day orientation and your parents will only be with you for the first half of the first day. In the following 2 days, you'll have chances to make friends, learn about campus resources, and go on excursions in the city.",

I remember last year during move in there were parents that got mad at us since they had to wait 3-4 hours in their cars before move in. On the flip side the people who got there earlier didn\u2019t have to wait long. but that coulda just been cause of covid and checking vaccines and tests and things and maybe this year will be same as usual?",

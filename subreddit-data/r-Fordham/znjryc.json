It was to inform me that my application had been referred to the HEOP program. I\u2019ve already sent them the required documents, but I\u2019d appreciate any info on the program from people who applied/are in it.",

Once you give them all of the required documents, they will probably ask to meet with you to talk about next steps or give you their decision if you will be accepted into Fordham as an HEOP student.\n\n\r  \nIf you do get accepted into the HEOP program, they will ask you to take pre development college courses in the summer to get you ready for your first semster. And throughout the semester, they also want you to schedule meetings with your HEOP advisor to make sure you are doing well and not struggling. Overall, it is a good program to help students that probably couldn\u2019t have gone to Fordham due to not having the grades and/or SAT score for it and not drown themselves in student loans.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I have two questions.\n\n1. According to Fordham, the average starting salary of Gabelli class of 2021 is $71734, do you guys think this is accurate? \n\n2. I\u2019ve heard many people saying that the outcomes of Baruch and Gabelli are similar, but according to Baruch, the average salary of Zicklin class of 2020 is $53696. Why is the difference so huge?",

            "comment": "Two things to consider here. First, the blanket $71,734 average starting salary is a little bit misleading. There is a massive difference in starting salary between marketing, accounting, and finance majors - so it completely depends on what you want to major in. Second, within each major, there are a lot of factors that lead to variation between starting salaries. Much of it depends on a student's commitment to networking, GPA, internship experience, and career plans. Finance majors who hold multiple internships in the banking industry can crack $100k in annual salary after graduation without too much trouble. Other finance majors who don't apply themselves in the same way end up making approximately $60k. It sounds like a cliche but your post-graduation outcome really is what you make of it. Let me know if you have any questions!",

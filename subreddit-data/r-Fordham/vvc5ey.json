Your parents attend with you on the first day (Move-in) and there will be events for your parents and you to attend until around 5/6ish? Then your parents are asked to leave and you begin the student only portion of orientation for the next two and a half days!\n\nSo if you\u2019re asking cause you\u2019re wondering if your parents should come with you, they definitely should. They\u2019ll just leave a little bit later.",

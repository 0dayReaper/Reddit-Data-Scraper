    "postText": "Recently admitted to Rosehill as a Finance major. Just wanted to hear from current students if landing a job at a BB for IB is pretty doable and not borderline impossible. I hear mixed reviews on Fordham for IB and just wanted to see what people on this forum have to say about the recruiting scene. Thank you.",

Fordham's office of professional development is amazing and if you connect with them, they will take excellent care of you. Here's a comment I left on a similar post:\n\n*Gabelli, especially within the finance and accounting track, is what you make of it. If you work hard, maintain a 3.7+ GPA, build a network, and are sociable you\u2019ll have no trouble securing top tier internships and a high paying job after graduation. For myself and most of my friends, that meant 6 figure salaries at top tier banks or high 5 figure salaries at the Big4. With that being said, if you get complacent and your grades fall, you\u2019ll probably end up much closer to a median post-graduation job and salary (which is also totally fine!) Just set clear goals early on and don\u2019t settle until they\u2019re met.*\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any additional questions. Happy to chat over PM.

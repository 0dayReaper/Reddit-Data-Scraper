The old setup was, IMO, more intuitive and had better divisions. This one might \u201clook better\u201d (esp on mobile) but only when on good wifi and better resembles the actual Fordham site.",

Like I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worse per se, but there\u2019s been no marked improvement to justify it? I think it\u2019s literally about the same (there\u2019s a learning curve, sure, but that goes for anything \u2014 including the previous set up lol).  Like idk, old setup was perfectly serviceable and they overhauled it for\u2026 what? Pictures?",

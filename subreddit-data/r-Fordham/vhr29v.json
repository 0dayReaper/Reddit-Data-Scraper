    "postText": "Should I take ENGL 1101 as a pre req for ENGL 1102? I think im alright in enlgish (like a B student) but I dont want to have to take an extra course. \n\nIs ENGL 1101 an easy A class or is it a class that will actually make me work? I dont have to take 1101 but it was recommended based of my high school grades or my SAT score.",

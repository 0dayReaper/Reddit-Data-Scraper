    "postText": "Due to popular demand: here\u2019s what works on me during the day\n\nStep 1: Establish eye contact to gauge level of immediate, superficial interest. Key word superficial. If she maintains eye contact or further smiles at you while doing so, she may be interested so go up to her and shoot your shot. More on that in the next step. But if she gives you one of those looks like \u201cwhy are you staring at me in the parking lot\u201d then it\u2019s a no-go and flirting would probably make her uncomfortable, which isn\u2019t appreciated. Gray area is if she makes eye contact and looks away quickly meaning either she\u2019s shy or that she\u2019s not interested. Have to feel out the situation. \n\nTL;DR: CHOOSE WOMEN THAT CHOOSE YOU\n\nStep 2: Shooting the shot: Honestly, pick up lines often come off as corny or awkward especially during the day. Proper and respectful delivery is paramount if you choose to go this route. In general, the likely best way to shoot is to go up to her and introduce yourself and transition to making a comment about the environment around you then continue conversation from there. For example, if you\u2019re in Cosi: introduce yourself (with a smile), offer a handshake, ask her what her name is, and then you could say something like \u201cwhat do you normally get when you come here\u201d, she\u2019ll tell you and you can make statements or casual flirty jokes about it. Very similar to improv. Body language and tonality are extremely important at this step. Be socially aware.\n\nRemember guys, when going up to a girl on campus you haven\u2019t met before, your mileage may vary based on a combined variety of factors (her mood at that specific time, how attractive she perceives you, if she\u2019s in a rush, etc.)\n\nAnd for those who think cold approach is wrong: what\u2019s a more romantic story to tell of how you two met, \u201cwe met spontaneously in walsh library\u201d or \u201cwe matched on Tinder.\u201d",

I take the train (and drive sometimes).\n\nIt's totally possible and depending on who you are as a person, you could either get super involved or not involved at all. From my experience, most commuters only arrive and leave for classes. They don't stay for any events or clubs. A lot of this I believe (as a commuter) can be put on themselves for leaving school so early. As someone who tries to get as involved as possible, I kinda evaded this freshman year -- but already find myself finding that it isn't worth the time and energy waiting around for a small club. I'm hypocritical, Ik. This is the same for both campuses -- but it's also the school's fault as there is a lack of support for commuters -- considering there aren't any real places for commuters only, food is so expensive, and a lot of events happen late at night, or at odd hours like on weekends. Of course, there is also the reasoning that commuting is EXHAUSTING, and now add on family pressures, curfews, and other small annoyances like traffic. It's understandable why many commuters struggle -- they're so fucking tired already.\n\nThat doesn't mean you won't make friends, however. I have tons of commuter and resident friends here at both campuses. Definitely recommend cultural clubs, it's kind of a cheat sheet for making new friends in college. Making friends is a LOT of work, however, so if you're not a social butterfly like me, it may be difficult.\n\nCommuting from Long Island to RH is tough. I remember going for Global Outreach and RamVan training for a bunch of weekends last semester. Depending on which route you take from LI (LIRR to Jamaica to Q44 (2 hours), LIRR to Penn Station to D train + walk (2hrs from where I am), driving (around 40 minutes without traffic), etc), it can take up to 2-3 hours to arrive at Fordham Rose Hill. This isn't bad at first glance, but when you do this constantly for days in a row, it is the most obnoxious thing. 10 am classes feel like 7:30 am classes. 8:30 classes?? Don't even bother -- just cut.\n\nBut again!! It's totally possible. I really enjoy my commute sometimes catching up on some sleep, watching morning subway performers annoy other passengers, watching a Netflix show, or just reading up on some news. Commuters stick together. So any commuter is instantly a friend. Trust that logic.\n\nHope this gives some insight for you into what it's like. Sadly, I can't answer your question completely as I'm not a Rose Hill student, but I believe that the commuter experience is more similar than different between both campuses. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask them!!",

I don\u2019t recommend doing a JOB first semester because its a pretty hard transition especially with the commute. Everybody has a different amount they can handle and you should definitely use your first semester to figure out a routine that works for you.\n\nHowever, that being said I definitely recommend trying out all the club you may be interested in. You don\u2019t have to attend every meeting to be a part of the club. In fact, you only need to go a few times a semester to be a member.\n\nSo with that info, I would say\u2026 do whatever you want!! theres no right way to do things. You make your own schedule so you can only go to school 4 days a week and work the other 3, etc. I currently have a part job at Fordham as well as a part time job in long island so yea\u2014 you can see that anythings possible, you just need to know what you can handle and how well you manage your time.",

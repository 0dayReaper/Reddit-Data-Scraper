Something is just really awry with Rose Hill. I has friends who went here a few years ago and when I visited it was a totally different place. Covid really changed things and it hasn't bounced back, or maybe the community has just changed. \n\nEither way, I wouldn't recommend it to others. I was excited to go here before, but the problems are just too much and I don't want to get trapped or regret it later. \"Hit-or-miss\" is a great way to describe it because some people love it, while others hate it. Very unfortunate considering the cost to attend.",

                                    "comment": "Sure.\n\nThe #1 problem you'll hear about is the price. Most people pay around $35k a year just in tuition. Fordham is incredibly expensive for a university that doesn't have nation-wide recognition. While it is well known in New York, it's not nearly as prestigious or recognized as NYU, Cornell, or Colombia. And honestly, prestige doesn't mean that much UNLESS you're going to a T20 (Fordham is rank sixty-something...?). The programs here aren't much better than SUNY schools which are a fraction of the cost, so unless you got a full ride or a ton of aid it really isn't worth it.\n\nSetting the cost aside, theres a ton of issues with the social scene at Fordham. People here - for one reason or another - are just really cliquey. Don't count on making friends or \"meeting\" anyone on your own if you're not joining a club, sport, or already have some established friends. New York City is also just filled with very unfriendly people, literally just the other day I was walking outside FMH and there was a homeless dude pissing on the building who flipped me off and yelled gibberish at me. This is pretty normal though, as Fordham sends out regular public safety alerts warning students of problematic people off campus and general issues (recent ones including a serial masturbator who exposed himself and followed women, a guy who slashed a student in the face with a box cutter, and another incident of robbery from a student apartment). These incidents aren't that common, but they happen every semester here and it IS NYC after all. \n\nAnd in the classroom.... Wow, do I have so many issues with Fordhams curriculum. Fordham suffers from an issue called \"grade deflation\", which basically means professors grade way harsher and kill GPA's just for the sake of doing so. This doesn't mean it's impossible to do well, just that you have to work a lot harder for that A and be prepared to drop classes after doing poorly on your first exam. Professors can also be pretty rude and unaccomadating and many are impossible to avoid as part of core classes you need to take. And wow let me just say that there is a TON of liberal arts courses you need to take! Way more than any other school. It can be annoying that you're paying a ton of money just to take classes that have nothing to do with your major, but I guess that's what's to be expected at the Jesuit university of New York.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't be surprised if my comment gets deleted for bashing on the school but everything I said here is true and everyone knows it. The sad part is, I wanted to love Fordham. I applied ED here after spending so much time visiting pre-COVID. This school was awesome back then! Spring weekend was especially fun. But now it's changed and the school is a shadow of its former self. \n\nBest of luck choosing your school! Maybe I'm totally wrong and you'll love Fordham, but this has been my experience and it's pushed me to want to leave.",

Or you can just ask a current student.\n\nI also just remembered an incident while I was visiting some friends on campus a couple years ago. Google \"Fordham university police chase\" because tbh I can't be bothered to summarize what happened and theres a video in the article that shows the lunacy that occasionally happens. This stuff is apart of every major city, but for some reason Fordham is just a magnet for incidents. I don't think it's affected my experience here too much, but it is very unsettling  nonetheless.",

And the pre req mandatory courses, have nothing to do with your major- theology, sacred texts and tradition, 4 semesters of foreign language( when other schools only ask for two), history, natural sciences, etc. \n\nI joined Fordham for the \u201cprestige\u201d but I have virtually no difference when it comes to job offerings. I\u2019m transferring out this semester to Long Island or CUNY. Fordham is good on paper, but don\u2019t fall for it. The amount of money you spend, could be spent twice on CUNY and you\u2019d graduate still. \n\nPlus, rose hill\u2019s in the Bronx, so there\u2019s crime or theft happening literally everyday or every other day. I know this, cuz of the Fordham public alert emails. Lincoln Center school, is far better, in terms of crime, but the academic and monetary hindrance still apply. \n\nIf this doesn\u2019t change your opinion, at least look into better schools, before choosing this one.",

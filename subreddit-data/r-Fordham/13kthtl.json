    "postText": "Hello! I am an international student thinking of transferring this fall. I come from a T1 school in my country, but I only have a 3.29 (albeit coming from a rigorous course that permits 18-26 units a semester). I have a lot of extracurriculars, and I believe a pretty compelling essay. Despite this, my GPA leads me to think I might not get in. I am contemplating on applying econ since I think it might be easier than a Gabelli course? I think I would prefer the marketing degree and the Gabelli alumni network, but I would rather get in and transfer, if thats easier.\n\nWould appreciate any insight.",

            "comment": "Gabelli lowkey got pretty hard to get into recently because they\u2019ve accepted more students than they could manage so they are limiting internal transfers. Econ is relatively easy to transfer into since it\u2019s another liberal arts major at fordham so they look at it pretty equally.\n\nTransferring into Gabelli is gonna be a crapshoot because they\u2019re probably gonna take students to fill in the spots of students that transferred out. I\u2019d give it a go but your GPA is gonna hurt you",

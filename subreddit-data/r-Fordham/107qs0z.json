Based off what I can see about Fordham's transfer stats I have a pretty decent shot. Can anyone tell me what their transfer experience was like? Is Gabelli tougher to transfer into than other programs at Fordham?\n\nThanks to anyone who can provide some insight.",

            "comment": "Hello! I just transferred from a public state university into Gabelli last semester and it was challenging but doable! Steven N. is the transfer advisor and it's sooo important to make a good relationship with him since he works out your transfer classes/schedule/basically everything important. The classes for transfers, depending on whether or not you do the consulting cup, can be a challenging adjustment but it's been helpful to make a good relationship with professors and advisors. The consulting cup was extremely challenging. Be ready for that. But it's unable to determine whether or not you're going to have to do it depending on what classes/what year you are when you transfer in. Other than that, I've enjoyed it so far and the resources that Gabelli offers have been so wonderful. If you do get in, take advantage of absolutely everything since you're paying for it!!!",

I have a FT job &amp; a PT job and want to know if the courseload is very intense. Also, is there a thesis/ capstone due at the end? Did anyone have any difficulties finding field placement? And just any other info you think is important for me to know!\n\nThanks in advance!",

I\u2019ll say that the academic course load wasn\u2019t overwhelming, but the overall obligations of an MSW program can be a lot. If you go part time I believe you won\u2019t start your internship until year 2. I completed the program in spring 2020 and, unless things have changed, Fordham does not actually allow you to get your own internships. They coordinate the internships for you which is a double edged sword because you dont have to worry about finding your own, but you also basically have to take what they give you within reason. First internship you basically get 0 say, second one they take your concentration/interests into account and most people seemed overall to be satisfied. One thing that sucks is that you also have to pay for the internship as part of your tuition bill. Not only are we not paid for our work\u2014we pay for the privilege! You may find that a lot of what it takes to get the MSW seems counter to the principles of social work.\nI don\u2019t recall a capstone/thesis at the end of the program. \nOne thing I would encourage you to explore is funding. Getting your MSW costs as much as a JD\u2026which is insane. The world needs great social workers and I don\u2019t want to discourage you\u2026just be careful",

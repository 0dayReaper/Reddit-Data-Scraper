    "postText": "I'm now a senior and I just finished registering for my last semester at Fordham. Looking back at my Degreeworks, I noticed that a lot of the courses I did well in still resulted me getting around a B+. My grades happen to follow the same, or worse pattern for my major courses(Math). I was a 4.0 student in high school, and the gpa I have at Fordham (3.3) is practically abysmal for me. I am not sure If others have found themselves feeling the same way, but I have struggled at Fordham, and I guess thats what makes the education so valuable.",

Although I should be happy for myself because I\u2019ve been able to make it thus far, and will be graduating next sem, I can\u2019t help but wish things were different",

None of the clubs look that interesting to me and since I\u2019m pre-health I know my schedule is gonna start to get busy. I\u2019ve never been a super outgoing person, but honestly I\u2019ll take any suggestions.",

You don\u2019t have to live and breathe the mission of the organization, it is just an hour or so of your week, especially as a first year. Most are largely social organizations anyway. Maybe you will be surprised by how interesting the org is and will decide to continue, but at least you will meet people.",

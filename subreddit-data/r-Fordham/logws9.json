    "postText": "I\u2019m a junior in high school considering applying to Fordham next year for college and am wondering if a Fordham degree is well respected along the east coast from the Gabelli school of business? I know it won\u2019t compare to an Ivy League degree but for someone interested in majoring in economics and accounting with an interest in going into consulting is Fordham a good school for that? Do a lot of companies in cities like New York, Boston, or Phili look at Fordham for recruitment?",

You won\u2019t have a problem getting big companies to notice you as long as you network well early on too. You can read this all on the gabelli website too, or search on LinkedIn where gabelli alumni/students work at. Almost every company is very attainable for anyone depending on the effort you put towards it",

            "comment": "Some of the comments are painting a bit overly rosey picture. Sure Fordham is respected but it's worth noting that the elite management consulting firms and investment banks do not actively recruit on campus in the way they do at other schools. Landing at these firms, which are highly competitive for a number of reasons, is certainly possible from Fordham but other schools have significant advantages.\n\n\nThe Ivys are obviously the top but even schools like NYU, Boston College, Villanova, etc. which to me are in the same tier as Fordham have much better on-campus recruiting. It can be frustrating but if you are aiming for the top and not shooting from the top then you have to work hard and find ways to bridge that gap.",

If you approach Fordham like a Columbia student you will miss its sweet spot.\n\nLikewise, if you are run of the mill at Columbia intellectually and do not have the street smarts, it will not be C an easy way foreword.\n\nFit matters.",

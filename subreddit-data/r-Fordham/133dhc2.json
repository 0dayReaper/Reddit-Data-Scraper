    "postText": "Hi, everyone!\n\nI wanted to ask for your perspective on which school you would pick of these two for undergrad. Here's some basic information about my circumstances.\n\n**Track**: Pre-law, hoping to enter a T14 law school for Big Law\n\n**Major**: Psychology, Philosophy, Political Science, or Economics\n\n**Scholarships**: Full-ride at Fordham (Cunniffe Presidential Scholarship) vs 10k at NYU (paying 50k for tuition and 25k for food and housing)\n\n**Finances**: I am fortunate to have a family that can afford to pay for my tuition, though I would prefer them to pay as little as possible.\n\n**Honors**: Fordham Lincoln Center Honors Program vs NYU College of Arts and Sciences Presidential Honors Scholars Program\n\n**AP credits**: I received a 4 or 5 on six AP exams (Calculus AB, English Language, World History, Human Geography, Spanish Language and Culture, and U.S. History) and taking five this year (U.S. Government and Politics, Environmental Science, Psychology, Statistics, and English Literature) that I believe I will also get 4s and 5s on.\n\nI prefer NYU's vibe and believe I would fit in better (a few people have told me I would fit in very well at NYU; one girl even said she has never met anyone better suited for their school). I will attempt to hold multiple club leadership positions and will likely try to found a club chapter at whatever school I attend. It will likely be easier to stand out at Fordham because of a) the small school size and b) the small size and greater cohesiveness of the honors program (\\~20 people). Fordham appears to be the more practical and logical choice, though I question if I will always wonder what could have been at NYU.\n\nIf you have any questions that would help you see the better choice, please put them in the comments. Thank you all for your help in advance. \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/133dhc2)",

            "comment": "Hopefully I can provide a pragmatic answer (FCRH and Fordham Law):\n\nTrack/Major: these don\u2019t really matter, law schools only really care about your GPA and LSAT because this is what they can post on their websites and distribute in marketing materials. So focus on your GPA and ensure that you are putting in a lot of time to study for the LSAT, with the realistic option of taking it multiple times to control for some tests being easier/harder than others. Extracurriculars with leadership roles are something that every T-14 student will have, with an increasing number of students coming in with work experience or another degree (MA or Ph.D). Can you get a better GPA at Fordham or NYU? Can you devote more time to study for the LSAT at Fordham or NYU? Can you have more substantial involvement outside of the classroom at Fordham or NYU? \n\nFinances: would you rather have a full ride and be able to have your family contribute to your graduate school tuition or would you rather pay $300k prior to incurring any debt for graduate school? This is dependent on you and your family\u2019s ability to pay, but with rising school costs, you\u2019ll likely be $525k if you get no money for law school (which is more and more realistic in the higher ranked T-14s).\n\nDeciding: Personally, I\u2019d go with Fordham for all of these reasons. You can make a substantive investment for graduate school after not having to worry about paying for your undergraduate degree since that\u2019s what BigLaw firms really care about anyway. At the end of the day, is $300k worth the self-doubt of wondering what your experience at NYU would have been if you went there over Fordham?",

Law school is SO SO expensive without a ton of undergrad debt. \n\nIt will not matter at all where your undergrad degree comes from for law school. you could go to a small  school in the middle of nowhere or a big state school and get T-14 from either. No one will care about your undergrad school when you\u2019re interviewing for law jobs.\n\nPick Fordham, take on the debt for a top law school, where it really matters in determining outcomes.",

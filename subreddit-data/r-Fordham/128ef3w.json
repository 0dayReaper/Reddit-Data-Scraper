    "postText": "Was recently admitted into Rosehill as a finance major. I\u2019m mainly just interested in pursuing a career in investment banking, and just wanted to know if ignite scholars would play a significant role when it comes to internships, networking, and overall just helping me break into the industry. Would it be more of a burden to join the program? or would it actually play a pretty big role when it comes to my journey. Thanks for the help.",

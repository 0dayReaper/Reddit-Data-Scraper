    "postText": "I am planning to begin my bachelor's in poli sci in spring 2022-2023 at rose hill. After my bachelors how difficult is it to get into Fordham law. What I'm really asking is there any favoritism in the admissions process because I went to Fordham undergrad? Is there a specific program where it is somewhat automatic entry or am I on an even playing field just like anyone else applying to Fordham law.",

Fordham is one of Fordham laws feeder schools, but spots ultimately go to the highest LSAT and GPAS, or deviations therefrom based on impressive softs. Going to Fordham will make a negligible difference if any.\n\nAs the below says, we had 3-3. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very competitive, though.",

You could, however, get a leg up if you worked with a law professor while an undergraduate and had them write you a letter of recommendation. The Center on National Security, the Law Clinics, and the Law Library all hire undergraduates. Other professors and centers might let you help with their research if you asked. If you are looking to apply this cycle it is probably too late for that though.",

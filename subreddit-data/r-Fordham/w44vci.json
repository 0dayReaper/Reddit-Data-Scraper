    "postText": "I\u2019m a rising sophomore and I\u2019m currently filling out my application to study abroad in London for the spring semester. I know the application says that the questions weigh 60% but does anyone how much of that is true? Is it possible to get accepted if you have less than a 3.5 gpa, even if it\u2019s not lower than that by much?  My gpa isn\u2019t that great (it\u2019s definitely not the worst either) and I\u2019m afraid to even apply in fear i\u2019m going to get hardcore rejected. \n\nAlso if you\u2019ve been accepted into the London program and have already gone do you think it\u2019s worth it to go?",

You can and should (even if not considering study abroad) speak with your advisor regularly to make sure you are making progress. Speak with someone at the Study Abroad Office, located in the basement of Walsh Library, to get their perspective on your individual case with regards to the London program if you are worried. Apply early.",

As the other commenter said, you should definitely reach out to the study abroad office and show them how important it is for you to study in London. Still though, I don't know a single student who got rejected. I really wouldn't sweat it too much.",

    "postText": "I'm considering taking two summer courses this year and wanted your thoughts. Is taking two classes in the same month too much? I plan to take Business Law (BLBU) with Cappello Dennis virtually and Operations and Production Management (OPBU) with Zhang Dongli in RH.\n\nI am conflicted with also taking OPBU since I have heard from others that the class is challenging because of the professors. Do you have any suggestions or thoughts on who I should take (and why) and if I should take this class in the summer or Fall (Professor Zhang is the only professor teaching this summer)?\n\nI am okay with a boring professor as long as the exams are not overbearing and the professor is reasonable. I want an A this summer; my GPA tanked the past few semesters, and I need to bring it back up.",

However, I would say that it's better to space them out over two months. If you do it both in one month, you'll be so stressed it will just be unhealthy, so I wouldnt recommend that.",

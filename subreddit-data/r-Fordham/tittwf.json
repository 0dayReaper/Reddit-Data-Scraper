            "comment": "There's a Starbucks a block from LC. A lot of students go to Birch which is nearby as well. There are a couple of study rooms across the different buildings, but they're not all that great. The library is okay, but not all the floors are open all the time. Printing isn't free, but the school gives you a certain amount at the start of the year. There's a Student ID office in the tunnel between Lowenstein and McMahon; you'll upload a picture for your ID in advance. Many food places around here. You'll get an email (many actually) about registration.",

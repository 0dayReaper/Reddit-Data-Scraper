    "postText": "Demographics: Afro Caribbean American Female. Large Public school in a poor area. Out of state.\n\nI\u2019m a rising senior with a 3.7uw gpa and a 4.1w gpa. I have moderate extracurriculars, but I have top leadership positions in all of them. I\u2019m a bank of america student leader and have an internship for the summer. I have hundreds of community service hours. I\u2019m also around the top of my class which isn\u2019t saying much since the school is very low ranked. I\u2019ve showed lots of demonstrated interest and plan to apply early action, but i\u2019m worried i\u2019m not a strong enough applicant.\n\nApplying as a political science major",

You'll only find out if you apply and it seems to me like you've been purposeful in maintaining an outstanding GPA with leadership positions. I'm don't work in admissions, just a lowly clerk. But it sounds to me like you would be a great candidate. Best of luck to you.",

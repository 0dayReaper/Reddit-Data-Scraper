    "postText": "I tried registering for an evening class at my campus but got an error that said 'Reserve closed.' I am already registered for 2 evenings, I just wanted to switch out the days for one of them.\nDoes anyone know the likelihood of being able to register for it once class begins?\n\nPS: I asked my summer advisor and she doesn't know",

If it\u2019s closes bur still has seats open it means the spots for \u201ctraditional\u201d college students are all taken. The professor nor dean will do anything about this. If there are still seats open after classes begin, you can ask to register but sometimes even in that case they will not allow you to register for the class",

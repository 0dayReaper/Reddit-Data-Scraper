I enrolled in the 3-2 engineering program at Fordham and was so discouraged by Fordham\u2019s STEM infrastructure I transferred to another university. Fordham only really cares about Gabelli, and the liberal arts. All the science labs are outdated, and courses are in gloomy buildings that are in dire need of a renovation.  I had some tremendous STEM professors are Fordham, but I also had the worst STEM professors of my life at Fordham. \n\nIm a chemical engineer now and the difference between Fordham and where I transferred to were significant in terms of investment in STEM, course offerings, and colleagues. As an engineer, I am so glad I transferred to a real STEM school.\n\nRegarding premed specifically, I\u2019m not convinced Fordham had the infrastructure in place to graduate 100 premeds, so their general science courses were notoriously difficult to discourage lower-classmen. In 2011, the entire 3rd floor of Alumni Court South was dedicated to STEM majors (primarily premed). By graduation, I\u2019d say a good 2/3 of them had switched to business, political science, or communications. The premeds that stuck it out however all graduated from tremendous medical schools.",

Most bio majors I know have a major GPA (just sciences) of 3.1-3.2. If you're interested in med school, you kind of have to bank on the hope that their admissions team knows the GPA is slightly deflated and look at it more like a 3.6-3.7.",

                            "comment": "Admissions stats for Fordham are weird, partly because the rigor between majors varies a *lot*. Apologies if I offend any business majors, but their coursework is a joke. Because of this, students going into some majors (like business) tend to have lower high school GPAs, which lowers the average of the accepted class.\n\nAdd to this the fact that there are literally hundreds of STEM majors freshman year who either fail out our drop out of STEM courses because they got too hard and you end up with a hardworking group of STEM majors who, from sophomore through senior year, can handle academic rigor. \n\nMy personal opinion is that Fordham deflates STEM grades because it's insecure about its position in the academic map. We're not at an Ivy level, where admissions and employers will take the name as gospel and not question the grade average. Simultaneously, we're not a D-tier school with no reputation and nothing to lose if every student graduates with a 4.0. Basically, Fordham tries really hard to produce highly intelligent students to increase its reputation, which can be a good thing. For example, I performed really well on the MCAT. The issue with this is that the tough courses often result in \"low\" science GPAs like a 3.1, which can't compete with an Ivy 4.0 or a D-tier school 4.0.",

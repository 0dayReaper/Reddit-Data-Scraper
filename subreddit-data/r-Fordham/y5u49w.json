Sign in with the usual Fordham sign-in, then upload your docs/pdfs/etc. Then go to the printer and sign in. The document should show up. Then you can click print, and it'll automatically charge your account.\n\nYou can check your balance and add more on Pharos as well. Most students start with $5 but can go up to $25 depending on your financial aid package :))\n\nIf you're a club leader or have a job at school you may find ways to print for free\\*\\*\\*\n\nHope that helps!!",

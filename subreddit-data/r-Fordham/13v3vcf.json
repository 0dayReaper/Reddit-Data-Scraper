    "postText": "I will be an incoming grad student starting the fall and I was wondering if GSAS students get accommodations for ADHD? Throughout my time in undergraduate studies I have received extra time for tests and distraction reduced environment when taking those tests because my ADHD is pretty severe. My doctor has clarified that for me. I find myself getting side-tracked very easily. \n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.",

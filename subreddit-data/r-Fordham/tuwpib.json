    "postText": "Hi! I'm thinking of majoring in Global Business with a concentration in Marketing at Fordham University at Lincoln Center and was wondering if the concentration I choose will help me in any way. Is it even worth getting a global business degree, or should I just major in marketing at Rose Hill instead? The only issue for me is that I like the Lincoln Center campus better, but I feel like a marketing degree would be more useful. Please help",

I checked the Degreeworks section and I saw people enrolling in classes for Fall 2023 and I was panicking. Would there still be space left for the freshmen entering later for classes like 11 AM and later?",

Most of the classes freshmen take like Comp II, Understanding Historical Change, etc. are all going to be open with a few sophomores registered who didn\u2019t get them done their first year (but there aren\u2019t many of them). \n\nFreshmen register sometime over the summer (your advisor will tell you the day) and you get the best classes you can. Most of the intro classes tend to be earlier in the day, unfortunately. Upper level courses can start later.",

The current freshman dean/advisor is also graduating with a PhD and is rumored to be leaving. So they may be looking for someone to replace them currently. You should receive an email though, if youre in gabelli, with a FAM which is a freshman year new students group which you'll get to know prior to arriving. Hope to see you on campus next year!",

She isn\u2019t great, and you won\u2019t know your grades til way later in the semester, and your grade relies solely on her exams. Do your due diligence with her rate my professor review but this professor is one of the rare cases in which the reviews pretty much sum her up. Gen Bio is a pain here. \n\nShe gives out pop quizzes, one hw assignment at the beginning of the semester, and talks about the big picture of certain topics without breaking things down and making the material digestible.",

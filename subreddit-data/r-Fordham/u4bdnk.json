    "postText": "All year I've had Fordham at the top of my college list. I got a really good scholarship, I'm accepted to the honors college, and I all the times I've visited NYC I've loved it. But I went to Spring Preview at RH last weekend and realized I didn't care for the campus as much as I was expecting. It felt small and didn't seem to have very many community spaces other than the one student life building. Honestly it kind of reminded me of my highschool which is not ideal lol. As a current student does this ring true for you or has your opinion changed? Are there enough people to meet new people every year or do you pretty much know everyone after freshman year? Where do you hang out? Basically, does the social scene suck? lol.",

Plus they closed like 4 spots to open the lounge in the new Mcginley which isn\u2019t even that big\u2026\n\nThey closed the old commuter lounge, the Mcginley basement, Keating Basement, and the second floor of mcginley so now everyones jus crowded in that one spot.\n\nThere def just needs to be more common social areas\u2026",

Tho of course, I went to a high school where there were only 20 kids in my graduating class, lol, so probably any college would\u2019ve felt big to me",

    "postText": "I was accepted into Gabelli at RH as a Marketing major but after touring both campuses I realized I did not like RH but I really loved LC. . I submitted the form to switch to LC as a Global business major with a concentration in Digital media and technology but they said they were unable to grant my request cause there was limited space.  What are the chances that I am able to switch and how soon would it be able to happen? I really want to go to LC so should should I commit to Fordham in hopes I can switch.",

Instead, Denmark (smaller country with fewer recourses) is currently offering the booster to people who are at increased risk of severe infection, including those who are older than 50 or work in the health care. By initially prioritizing the more vulnerable and exposed people, they are protecting the community as a whole.\n\nThe problem is, our immunity from the vaccines decreases over time as the virus evolves and our immune system forgets. This is why it\u2019s so important that we choose to get the re-engineered and updated booster shots. While sometimes it may not prevent you from getting covid entirely, there is indisputable evidence that the vaccine and boosters reduce your risk of serious infection, long covid, and death.",

They are not initially prioritizing people over 50 and immuno-compromised. They are saying it's unnecessary at this time for people younger than 50:\n\n\"The guidelines added that people below 50 years of age were not at a particularly higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 symptoms.\r  \n\r  \n\"In addition, younger people aged under 50 are well protected against becoming severely ill from covid-19, as a very large number of them have already been vaccinated and have previously been infected with covid-19, and there is consequently good immunity among this part of the population,\" the country's health authority said.\"\n\nSee the part about them not being at high risk and having good immunity. Then they continue with \"however\":\n\n\"However, in its autumn vaccination programme starting October 1, people under the age of 50, who have vulnerabilities, will be offered inoculation.\"\n\n  \n\"However\" doesn't mean they're initially prioritizing these people. It simply means it's offered to them but not to those under 50 with no immune issues. \n\nI didn't mean to imply that the Denmark article was a statement about risks (although there certainly are), but it might be - I didn't read their actual decision. I just wanted to mention that a second booster is not only not being forced on young people there but it's not even being offered. \n\nAs I said, I posted this to invite anyone who doesn't want it forced on them to join us and speak out.

Think about it and consider it. An organization can make anything, reasonable or unreasonable, a mandate simply because they have the power to do so. Our only choices should not be to obey blindly or leave the college. Keep in mind that almost everyone there has already complied with the original series and one booster, the situation has changed, yet Fordham is continuing to force it instead of leaving it up to the individual. We are asking for Fordham to be reasonable and recommend it, like the CDC does, but not mandate it.  Thank you.",

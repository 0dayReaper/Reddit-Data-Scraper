I somehow tested into Spanish II, despite having never taken Spanish in my life... and since I'm in the honors program, they do my course registration for me. I asked to switch down to Spanish I since I've never taken Spanish before but was told I had to wait until the first week of classes. Is that wise? How easy is it to switch my classes during the first week?\nI absolutely cannot take Spanish II, especially considering how hard language courses at Fordham sound.",

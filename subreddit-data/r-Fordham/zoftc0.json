            "comment": "im actually a transfer. i was accepted prior to my first year of college and did not enroll due to the high tuition. i hated my freshman year adn applied to transfer and fordham gave me good aid, which i appealed because it was still too much, which resulted in a fordham donor contributing. to my tuition (which was so lucky). to be hoenst, fordham isn't the best for my chosen field, but ultimately its been the right choice for me. its by no means a flawless institution and i actually didn't think id like it after starting but after getting more involved and spending more time here, its grown on me! highly recommend getting involved in extracurriculars (impersonally involved in student publications and theatre). rose hill has an extraordinary campus, close ish to arthur ave in the Bronx. the ram van will take you to the lc campus. the opps at Fordham are also amazing, as well as the networking and connections. deffo hate the core curriculum, but its definitely made me smarter. \n\nthe gist is that college is four years of your life. it matters where you go, but ultimately, it will be what you make of it. so if you're feeling drawn elsewhere, go. but personally, making it at Fordham has been the right choice for me. feel free to ask any questions btw!",

Campus is beautiful, easy to make friends, education is great(personally found it challenging if you don\u2019t put enough time). Changes after transferring: reached out by big name corporations for great internship opportunities. I am in Gabelli, don\u2019t know how it might play out for different majors. I\u2019m glad I made it to FU.",

I was worried as a STEM student (biology and chemistry double major) because I had a hard time finding people talking about research, but it was definitely the right move for me. A lot of what I\u2019ve experienced has been that Fordham has a ton of resources but you have to really look for them and work for them. I highly recommend it, but go wherever you best see yourself and above all what puts you in the least debt while balancing being a good school.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, for some context, I\u2019m a rising soph (but will probably graduate a year early) and currently commute to LC from LI. Although I enjoy going to the city and taking classes, the few friends I made really haven\u2019t stuck, and I feel like I\u2019m sort of missing out on the college experience. \n\nAcademically, RH would be a better choice as well bc more course offerings for my major (math) and access to more clubs aligned with it.\n\nThe only catch for me, really, is money. I have a decent scholarship covering 50% of tuition so I have some wiggle room, but still, I don\u2019t want to waste money paying for a dorm 50 min away from my house. I\u2019ve also heard some mixed things about the social scene/food and other basic considerations at RH, so I really want to make sure that it\u2019s worth it.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

Way easier to go to house parties, walk to campus, etc. without paying the pretty penny for a meal plan and dorm.\n\nAlso a plus of having people over to your house without having to jump through the hurdle of guest access on campus",

            "comment": "IMO, the dorms were worth the money for the extra security and quiet. But they\u2019re not for everyone. \n\nJust fyi: Res Life has a policy that once you opt out of campus housing, you\u2019re not guaranteed a room on campus. That means that you could request \u201con campus\u201d housing and get stuck in an off-campus university-owned apartment.",

            "comment": "Hii! I'm also a fellow rising soph commuting to LC from LI. You probably live a little closer to me since my commute to Rose Hill would be WAY longer than 50 min.\n\nSounds like switching to Rose Hill will probably be good for you, especially if you want a change in pace and hopefully catch the \"college experience\", and definitely if it helps out your major.\n\nHave you thought about possibly getting a place off-campus? It's way cheaper than doing and you could cook, have people over, have freedom, etc.\n\nI don't think you can do this for this year, but the following year you could possibly apply to be an RA? -- you would get free dorming.\n\nOther than that, if the commute isn't the biggest problem, Grand Central Terminal is opening an LIRR concourse later this year so commuting to Rose Hill from LI will become way easier.",

That would be super convenient bc I don\u2019t love driving anyways, so I\u2019d probably end up commuting like 1hr 40 min via Penn station/subway without Grand Central access. I\u2019m going to try to get involved at RH with some extracurriculars this fall and see how it goes from there probably. Thanks for the help!",

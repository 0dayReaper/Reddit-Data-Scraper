Or like often huge protests or places I should avoid around the campus ?\nI\u2019m not a party type person so it would be delightful to know few other safe entertainment places too \ud83d\ude0a\nTHANKS A LOT !!",

As a parent, I would not recommend to/from the subway line in off hours/after dark and an employee told me local forays off campus should not be done alone.",

If walking alone late at night, walk in groups and other things like that. I haven't seen any huge protests around the Bronx either. There's a lot of \"safe entertainment\" places either on campus or in Manhattan.. mostly what you'll find off campus in the Bronx is a lot of restaurants and parties.",

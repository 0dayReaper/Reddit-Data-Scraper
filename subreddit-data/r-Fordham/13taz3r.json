Fordham won't even consider it. \ud83d\ude15If these are the grades you are gonna continuously get, just go to a free community college in your home state, it won't be worth your money otherwise if you aren't taking your education seriously. Just being realistic. Sorry, but no.",

I tried to go to okstate because my parent wanted me to and just felt horrible every single day. And that had a very hard impact on my second semester, but I did try and tried my best. So I\u2019m working on it, and I\u2019m trying to tranfer somewhere close to Maryland. But is still far, and try to get my gpa up to like a 3.7 or 3.5.",

First college grades will not be factored in at all if you just start at community college with high school transcript. You have a better chance with scholarships too with a high gpa.",

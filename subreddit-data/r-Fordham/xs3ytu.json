Also, how do I explain to guys that I actually want a relationship and not a hu? I've been harassed by too many men who just want sex tbh. I'm tryna cuddle and be cute and go on city dates and shit!! But it's hard to tell what a guy wants especially when it's a natural meet up :/",

If you\u2019re relatively attractive you can definitely get a dudes instagram on the spot because most of us are T\u2019d up so we need an ego boost when a girl asks for our insta.\n\nYou should talk to them for a few days or weeks and ask them if they\u2019d like to grab a coffee or grab a bite to eat after class. It\u2019s that simple. Then for the second time around ask them on a morning brunch over the weekend and go to a mall or museum and do some cute shit. The only way for you to make it apparent that you want to have a relationship is to do relationship-centric activities. A few dates in if they haven\u2019t asked you out you can say \u201cso when are you gonna ask me out\u201d. Go from there",

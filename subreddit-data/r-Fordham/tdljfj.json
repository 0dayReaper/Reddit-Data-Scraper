    "postText": "I got accepted for fall 2022 to FCLC International Studies and I really want to go here. I just wanted to know how is the program at Fordham and the pros and cons. I hope to attend Fordham but the cost overall is a bit too much for me and my family but I feel like Fordham will be a really good fit for me. I just want to be sure that if I do end up paying $30k tuition it will be worth it.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s alright overall. Pros are (mostly) great professors, relatively small class sizes (no TAs), being in NYC vs in a college town. There\u2019s also eventually a senior thesis which is a pretty good experience for most students. \n\nCons are that some of the tracks are really light on courses, there will be enough for any student to finish the major on time but sometimes this means taking classes that are only tangentially relevant to what you\u2019re interested in. And of course the cost ! If it is in fact a bit too expensive then don\u2019t put it at the top of your list, I as an IS major found it to be a good program but probably not worth heavy debt for. Good luck :)",

            "comment": "In regards to the mattress topper I would definitely recommend it! My bed at school is honestly comfier than my bed at home because of it. Depending if you get one that straps onto the mattress or not I would recommend putting one of those things you put under carpets underneath it. My freshman year it kept on sliding around but now it stays in place",

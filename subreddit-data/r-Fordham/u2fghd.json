    "postText": "I've been admitted to RH and am planning on double majoring in English and Political Science. I was wondering what the job placement is like right after you graduate. Does the school help with that? What's career counseling like? At admitted students day no one really talked about it and the current seniors I talked to didn't have jobs lined up so.... a little concerning for me personally hahaha.",

Fordham isn\u2019t a school where you can just get an internship/job based on the brand name of the school you go to. \n\nThat said being at Fordham has its benefits:\n1. Large network of professionals in nyc\n2. Internships during the school year (easier to get &amp; makes your future applications more impressive)\n3. Well known in nyc, and generally seen as the 3rd best school in New York City \n\nIf you put in the work academically and professionally you should be good. It\u2019s tough, especially in a field like political science if you aren\u2019t planning on going to law school.",

            "comment": "As a graduating senior, I would say that Fordham has actually been good for jobs. Or, at least, it certainly isn\u2019t a deterrent! I\u2019ve been offered three decently competitive jobs in the political sphere so far. I was a Gabelli student, but I used the regular schools career counseling over Gabelli because I found them much more helpful and knowledgeable to what I ultimately want to do (lobbying). They do job search  help, resume building/review, interview prep, etc. You still have to do the bulk of the work at getting internships/jobs though, it won\u2019t come to you. Networking is truly the ultimate tool, so go to the school\u2019s semesterly job fairs, Club presentations, networking events, etc because that\u2019s where the magic happens.",

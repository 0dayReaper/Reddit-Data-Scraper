Some of the professors are pretty bad to be honest but not much of a deal breaker imo. That being said if you\u2019re only interested in Fordham because of their Comp sci program there are definitely far better options",

A lot of professors will take on students part time for research so it\u2019s possible to at least get some experience, but I wouldn\u2019t count on them hooking you up with an internship. As far as education goes I\u2019m definitely learning a lot, and you can get pretty far just by being able to google stuff",

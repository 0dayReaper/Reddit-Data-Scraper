            "comment": "hi, i'm a sophomore majoring in political science at rose hill. it is possible to switch campuses. traveling between campuses is easiest using the ram van which goes between the campuses (takes around 35-45 minutes, costs $3.50 unless you have a class there then it's free). For both of my fall semesters i took 6:00-8:45 classes at lincoln center and i found it easy and reliable to take the ram van. as far as campus culture, it's very different depending on the type of people. for example, gabelli students are a bit more preppy and whatnot, but join the coffee shop on campus and you can find queer leftists. basically, there's a community for everybody. in my experience finding friends and where i fit in was easy. feel free to pm me if you have any other questions about political science there or anything!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a freshman so I just finished my first semester at Fordham. Planning to double major in English and political science. So far I have only good things to say honestly. I go to rose hill and so I\u2019m definitely biased but I must say I prefer it to Lincoln center mostly because it\u2019s bigger and some of the resources like career center stuff are more accessible at RH. Culture as a whole is fantastic though imo. I\u2019ve made lots of friends in my dorm, clubs, and I\u2019m in the honors program so I\u2019ve made lots of friends through that as well. The clubs especially are nice bc people tend to be pretty involved (I don\u2019t know anyone who isn\u2019t in at least one club) and then you\u2019ll know for sure you have at least something in common. Anyways I love it so far!",

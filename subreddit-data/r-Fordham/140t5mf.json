    "postText": "Hi everyone! I will be moving to New York in August, and I am trying to find other Fordham students (current or incoming) to find a place near the Lincoln Center campus. I'm (male) not very picky with other people's preferences. I'm very clean. I also don't have any pets.\n\nFeel free to reply to the Reddit or directly message me if you are also in the same boat and trying to find a place. Maybe we can look for a place together.\n\nI will be studying for my MS in Data Science at Fordham if anyone is curious.",

    "postText": "Hey guys! My name is Angela and I am a senior majoring in psychology at Fordham LC. I am doing a thesis study on the effect of tonal language speaking on pitch discrimination ability, and I am looking for participants who speak certain languages (including English). I have been recruiting speakers from different online communities so here I am! In short, you will be asked to fill out some survey questions and then complete a computer program. The entire procedure should take about 30 mins (no longer than 45 mins) and you will be compensated for $5! This is an IRB approved study so everything runs according to procedures. Detailed information regarding the study can be found in the poster below. If you are interested, please scan the code below for a quick screening, and I will reach out to you in short!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eue7773bklqa1.png?width=1545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c6916544d651dc4972636618e21901ad82921e1c",

You can also leave your preference of compensation in the survey once you are invited to the study just to keep track since it is an anonymous study, but thanks for being so caring and nice :)",

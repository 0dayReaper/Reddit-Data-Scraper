    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am looking to do a master\u2019s that would help develop brand storytelling skills. At Fordham, I\u2019ve seen two possible Master\u2019s that could be helpful, but I\u2019m not sure and wondering if anyone could give more info on them or let me know of any other suitable master\u2019s.\n\nMaster of Science in Media Management (at Gabelli)\n\nMaster of Arts in Public Media\n\nAny feedback about the courses or schools; or info on who could help me further?  \nWhat are the differences between Fordham and Gabelli? Is it mainly the location of the campus?\n\nSorry for the questions I'm a European and still trying to accustom myself to the American Uni system.",

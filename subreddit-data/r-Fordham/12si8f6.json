I would book the van for an hour before your class just in case (class at 2:30, book van for 1:30)\n2. People are pretty social! I\u2019m pretty introverted (no extracurricular clubs, don\u2019t party) but have still made a good amount of friends. Some people can be standoffish but you\u2019re going to find that anywhere. Generally most people are nice and willing to talk and go out places :)\nAt rose hill I\u2019ve found it\u2019s pretty similar, but definitely have less social experience there, just cuz I haven\u2019t been there often. People seem a bit more \u201cfratty\u201d there but I\u2019ve also found artsy nerdy friends there too. I\u2019d say it\u2019s similar? But I don\u2019t have much experience \n3. There\u2019s like 5 diff places (Argo - cafe, ram cafe - mix of stuff like a buffet, dining hall, smeltzers - kinda grocery store ish, SVK - fast food). All are going to require meals wipes or dining dollars. Honestly just go with the cheapest plan, you\u2019re not gonna need more than it\n4. LC is very close to Columbus circle &amp; Central Park, midtown, and timesquare. It\u2019s also literally right next to Lincoln center (hence the name) and very close to Carnegie hall and Broadway. There is TONS to do in the city and I haven\u2019t gotten close to even getting half of it done despite going out every weekend. There\u2019s always some sort of musical show going on, or opera, or orchestral performance. I know there\u2019s a lot of small scale bands performing and such. Lots of concerts, art exhibits. Of course, if you\u2019re interested, there\u2019s 8 gajillion bars and clubs nearby. You\u2019re smack in the middle of Manhattan, hard to not find something to do",

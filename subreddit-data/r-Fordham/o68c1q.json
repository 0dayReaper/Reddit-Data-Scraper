    "postText": "I made a title IX report at Fordham.\nBig things: \n1. Always speak to the coordinator about your incident- NEVER public safety. They are not structured to take Title IX cases fairly. \n2. Document Literally EVERYTHING. Even right after the incident happens you can write a memo via email or other ways to yourself about when, where, how it happened. \n\n\u00a0I've always wanted to help post it onto a larger newspaper or editorial (like NYT) because that's how I got some help.\n\nIn case anyone is out here dealing with harassment/forcible touching/sexual assault or even Bullying and wants advice/support, feel free to reach out to this account any time.",

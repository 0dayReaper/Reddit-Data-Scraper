    "postText": "I received all my finals grades about a week ago except for one class. I checked again today, and it only displays a NGR (no grade reported). I was confused about what this meant and on Fordham\u2019s website it states that \u201cNo Grade Reported for Pending Academic Integrity Violation Cases: When a student chooses to challenge an Academic Integrity Violation, they will receive a NGR by their instructor until notified by the chair of the relevant Academic Integrity Committee.\u201d Obviously, I\u2019ve been really freaking out since seeing this, and I was wondering if anyone\u2019s ever received a NGR for anything else. We only had a final paper in this class, and I didn\u2019t plagiarize it. Also, if I was suspected of academic dishonesty wouldn\u2019t they normally have contacted me about that by now?",

            "comment": "So the way the system works is if the instructor did not submit a final grade by last Friday (I think) the system automatically turns it into NGR and it seems like that is the most obvious explanation. Check with other people in your class if they got a grade and check with the instructor.",

If you don\u2019t hear back, contact your class dean and see if they have more info (like, are all the student in your class in the same boat?) or see if they can sort it out with the prof. If you submitted everything on time, it probably has nothing to do with you. Either the prof made a mistake or something happened to your prof. If they think you did something sketchy, they probably would have already reached out to you.",

Definitely my dream school but finding housing feels impossible. There are some places that offer housing for women at rates $1100 and less. If you find anything please update on this thread !!!\n\nSucks to be in this postion",

                                            "comment": "It really depends on how close you want to live to campus. In terms of social stuff, fordham is a huge commuter school- meaning a ton of students travel in from parts of the city or nearby suburbs that are nowhere near the school neighborhood. Therefore, you won\u2019t be unusual for living further from the school and it is definitely possible to have a social life even if you aren\u2019t right near campus. There is always fun stuff to do in any neighborhood and if you want to hang out around fordham some nights you can take public transit home or stay with a friend. \n\nSo fordham is on the D/B (and kind of the 4) trains and the metro north line (though note that metro north train tix are more expensive). You could definitely look for housing around the Harlem 125 st metro north line or at any stop on the b, D , or 4 trains. You can also look anywhere else in the city but it begins to get more complicated the more train transfers you have to do. I would also look into the MTA buses that travel between Fordham and other parts of the bronx. Harlem is great area to live in as there are several trains going in and out of it. It is also between the Bronx (where fordham is) and midtown and downtown Manhattan (where better paying jobs are-if you plan to get one.) Although it may take you between 30-70 minutes to get there, that is a very normal commute time for New Yorkers and time on the subway can easily be spent reading for class or listening to music or podcasts. Queens is also a good, and probably cheaper than the Bronx or Harlem, place to live. If you don\u2019t plan on having a car your best option is probably to take a bus to queens (the train goes there but it first goes all the way into Manhattan and then back up- very out of the way but possible!) Queens is definitely a bit more complicated to get around but it\u2019s also very doable and would be the best budget option. Brooklyn also has some cheaper options but is much further and would be a 1-2.5 hour trip . Again, not the end of the world but it\u2019s significant time. \n\nThe other transportation option is the Ramvan which goes between Lincoln center and Rose hill. It\u2019s $3.50 and takes like 20-60 minutes depending on traffic and is a little easier than the train. That is a good option for if you choose to live in Manhattan(Harlem)/queens/Brooklyn because if you can catch a train or bus in one of those boroughs to the very big and easy to access Lincoln center or Columbus circle stations, you can then easily hop on the Ramvan to head to school. (However, it is that extra 3.50)\n\nBasically you will 100% need to have more than one roommate if you want to live somewhere under $1000 a month. Likely 2-3 roommates. There is an app called Roomies where people post looking for roommates to join their house or people search for living situations (you.) Apartments .com and Streeteasy are 2 big apartment hunting sites but they tend to be more expensive since they charge landlords to post listings. Leasebreak .com is a site for people who are looking for subletters- meaning people to stay in their apartment unofficially- for any period from 1 month to over a year. These tend to be cheaper but a little less predictable. Craigslist and Facebook marketplace are probably the best places to look for cheap places and often they come with roommates. Definitely be careful though, as no one is getting those postings to make sure they are legit /safe. NextDoor is an app/site for neighborhood people to communicate with each other that also has some options but you would somehow have to spoof an address to prove you live in the neighborhood. I would also recommend posting on your social media asking for recommendations and joining reddits, Facebook groups (including fordham AND other nearby college Facebook groups), other online places where people are looking for roommate. Also check with fordham to ask if they have like a posting board or Google from for students who are looking for off campus housing.\n\nThe *cheapest* reasonable place you will find will probably be about 700 to 900. You may get lucky with Facebook/Craigslist/ REALLY deep internet diving and find somewhere with roommates that\u2019s weird and lucky and random for like 6 something or even 500 (or possibly with the option to share a room to split costs-if you can find sometime who is willing to do that too.) In the fordham neighborhood you can definitely find somewhere for between 700 and 900 (my rent is 850) with a few roommates, although 700 would be really hard.",

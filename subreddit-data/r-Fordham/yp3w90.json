    "postText": "I am a senior in high school applying to LC Early Decision. I have a 3.62 weighted (3.52 UW) GPA from a private Catholic school in the Midwest. Not submitting ACT/SAT. 1 AP class (AP Bio) and 5 dual credit. Extra curriculars are dance team (captain senior year), student recruiter, Best Buddies, and service team. Lots of service hours. Summer job as nanny. Great letters of recommendation. What are my chances? I\u2019m very anxious",

Fordham is very difficult to get into and you need good stats to get in 3.7+ and 30-34 ACT. Take advantage of the acceptance rate now because it is expected to decrease again by a lot in the coming years.\n\nALWAYS apply anyways even if you think you won't get in. You never know what is gonna happen. This goes for any school. Good luck",

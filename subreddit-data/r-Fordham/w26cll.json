I\u2019d prefer daytime hours but understand night might be more likely with all of the restaurants. If anyone has had any good experiences with pay/ bosses/ hours or if there is anywhere I should avoid let me know :)",

            "comment": "Working on campus is a great option. You get to change your schedule every semester to work around your schedule. Supervisors are pretty understanding when you miss a shift for exams. Most jobs are $15 per hour. IT and RamVan pays more. Plus, when you work off campus they might get annoyed if you want to go home for a long weekend or can\u2019t come in during the longer breaks. Reach out to student employment.",

Beautiful scenery, happy people there for fun, and you get to be outside. \n\nAs an upperclassman I worked 2-3 nights a week at a bar/restaurant downtown. Took metro north both ways for safety. It\u2019s expensive compared to the subway (and faster/more comfy than the ram van), but the money I made far outweighed the price of the train and it was good to get out of the campus bubble regularly. Good luck!\n\nEdit: working on campus could be great, but those jobs were mostly allocated to work-study grantees (like me) during my time at rose hill. Things may well have changed.",

            "comment": "Disclaimer: I am still in undergraduate, not law school and considered this program. After talking to my advisors, decided not to pursue it.\n\nAnswering this because no one else has yet\u2026 my honest opinion:\n\nDoing the 3-3 Program is a good option if you are paying a lot of money for your undergraduate education and want to save money buy essentially skipping your fourth year. It\u2019s also good if you want to graduate Law School really early.\n\nI personally think there\u2019s more downsides to the program. 1st, you have to be absolutely certain that you want to go to law school. 2nd, you miss out on your senior year which (as a senior) is largely considered the most fun and formative in terms of your undergraduate career. 3rd, you are entering law school really really young. Although you hear a lot of people going straight into law school from undergraduate, a lot of law school classes are made up of older individuals as well.\n\nLogistically, if you enroll in the program you can only apply to Fordham Law School. Which means as a JUNIOR in college you have to be a competitive applicant in terms of quants and quals because you are not guaranteed admission just because you are a part of the program, AND you have less time (or you have to start earlier) to study for you LSAT which is a huge component.\n\nThat being said, i\u2019ve heard there isnt an extremely strong benefit to being a part of the 3-3 program. So if you would be accepted to Fordham Law as a part of the 3-3 Program that means you\u2019d be competitive at a number of other law schools.\n\nIF you\u2019d be competitive then that means you\u2019re most likely to get in and/or get various amounts of scholarships. Scholarship negotiation is (to my knowledge) an extremely important part of the law school enrollment process. you do not want to be paying for the entirety of law school. And if you\u2019re solely limited to Fordham, they could give you nothing and you\u2019d have no bargaining power.\n\nThat being said, I understand saving money on college which this option helps people who might be paying straight outta pocket for their bachelors and want to accelerate that process by going to law school early and potentially getting scholarships for law school too. \n\nI personally recommend waiting though, making yourself the strongest applicant you can, applying to different law schools, seeing your scholarship packages, negotiating with all your schools so you can go where you want to go at the cheapest possible cost to you. \n\nLet me know if you have anymore questions!",

Since you did, I hope you don\u2019t mind if I ask for a bit more info?\n\nLike, one part of me totally wants to work my ass off for and try to get into the 3/3 program and actually come off out successful in the end. It would totally be awesome and all if I actually made it, but since you said it\u2019s something really competitive, what kind of stats do people typically ideally have to get in?\n\nAlso, how prestigious is Fordham Law School? Like, I can get wanting to graduate a year faster, for sure. But law school is a huge commitment in itself, and like you said, it\u2019s something that people need time to consider and aren\u2019t 100% sure if they want to do it, and the whole point of the program is to get it done as quickly as possible. So if I really made it in, just how worth is it in the end aside from getting scholarships? How attainable is big law/corporate law?\n\nThank you for your time and sorry if my questions seemed a bit ridiculous! I just want to know whether or not I should truly take my time, or grind as much as possible!",

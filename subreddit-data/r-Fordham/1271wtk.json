    "postText": "Hey guys, I am a prospective freshman next year and have a few questions regarding social life and dorms. What's the social scene like on campus? I'm not super big into huge parties, so will I have a hard time making friends if I don't go? Are there smaller/more laid back things that happen often? Also, just wanted to ask what the dorms are like and if there are any freshman buildings with pod style bathrooms or if they are all just communal. Thank you!!",

There are many raffle events for free tickets to events like ice skating in Bryant Park during the winter and most commonly, broadway shows. There are also dorm events that you can attend, which also gives you the chance to meet other people in your dorm. The social scene is what you make of it, but if you talk to people consistently you'll definitely make some friends.\n\nAs far as dorms go, the only freshman dorm with a private bathroom is Queen's Court, but \\*only\\* Bishop's hall. Most dorms are pretty standard, with Martyr's by far having the worst reputation.\n\nYou're in New York City, the biggest city in the US, so go have fun with it since the sky's the limit for what you can do!\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions :)",

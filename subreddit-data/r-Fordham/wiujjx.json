    "postText": "Hello everyone! I want to apply ED to Fordham this fall. However, I am extremely worried. I have 5 Cs on my transcript and \u2026bad regents scores. I know it sounds bad. (and it is pretty bad haha) However, I can explain why this happened. If you want to know, you can PM me. On the bright side, my essay is strong (I\u2019ve gotten it checked by multiple people) and I have very strong extracurriculars and awards. How much will this effect me? I\u2019ve always wanted to attend Fordham.\n\nEDIT: you guys are so helpful \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79",

I\u2019m an incoming freshman at the Rose Hill campus (if you are debating between LC and Rose Hill, I HIGHLY recommend the RH campus instead of LC if you want a more \u201ctypical\u201d college experience). I applied EA for Film&amp;TV and got in first round of admissions. I had a C in Algebra II my junior year and a C in both semesters of AP Psych in my senior year. I was in the average demographic of their ACT range (I had a 29 super score) and submit my scores. I also had a great essay. My GPA was a 3.7 weighted. So, I was a fairly \u201caverage\u201d applicant. I truly expected to get no merit scholarship from Fordham because of my average-ish grades. But, I think my essay SAVED me on that. I ended up getting 25 grand per year off of tuition all for merit. I truly believe this is because of my essay. I think you could have a great shot. Reach out to your admissions counselor at Fordham and try to form a relationship with them. This can help too. Best wishes and go Rams!",

Truth be told, any average applicant with a decent gpa and a ok sat score or even no sat score can get in no problem. Especially if you have ECs, it\u2019s not hard at all. Truthfully, some SUNYs are harder to get into than fordham is (binghamton, stony brook). You don\u2019t need to be a stellar applicant. Just apply, do well on your first semester of senior year, have a some what compelling story, and have a decent explanation for the Cs",

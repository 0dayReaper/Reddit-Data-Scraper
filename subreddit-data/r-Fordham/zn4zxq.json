I have similar questions, but it seems that while it is of course a Catholic school, there is still a good mix. This was the mix of religious affiliations on the website:\n\n\"Catholic: 45.5% \u2022 Jewish: 2.7% \u2022 Protestant: 12.4% \u2022 Muslim: 4.6% \u2022 Other: 11.4% \u2022 Not reported: 23.3%\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo while there don't seem to be a great number of Protestants, the Christian is very high so I'm sure you won't feel too singled out. You also can choose religions other than Catholicism/Christianity for your two theology requirements for the core curriculum. They offer classes on Protestantism and the Reformation that you can choose.\n\nI'm hoping the ministry options aren't too strictly Catholic, as I believe there are fairly open worship assistance opportunities.\n\nThere is a fellowship for Rose Hill and one for Lincoln Center (you can join either no matter your college), but there don't seem to be any clubs or organizations for specifically the Protestant branches; at least, I haven't found any.\n\nGood luck! I hope you decide to apply. I'd be excited to see more Protestants!! :)",

I would email Campus Ministry if you\u2019re concerned tho, they\u2019re super approachable and do a lot of interfaith stuff so I\u2019m sure they\u2019d have better answers than me, an agnostic alum.",

            "comment": "Great question! I\u2019m always glad to see inquiries about faith. I\u2019m currently in the campus ministry team, so I\u2019ll be glad to share my two cents.\n\nYes, since Fordham is a Catholic, Jesuit school, the majority of Christians here are Catholic. However, we are a Jesuit school. We are not afraid to ask questions about our faith. One of the Jesuit\u2019s biggest mottos is \u201cfaith seeking understanding.\u201d That said, you\u2019ll likely find that a Jesuit environment will be quite welcoming to all sorts of faith. Here, we are challenged not to just conform to religion, but to learn more about it, and yes, at times question it and reflect on it.\n\nFor y\u2019all who are Protestants, I\u2019m sure you will find many things of value that are enriching to your Christian faith. As of now, we hold retreats that are spiritual but not necessarily religious, but there are some that definitely can be. Here are the ones freshmen are eligible to go on:\n\n*FreshVision\n*Emmaus\n*COR\n*Men\u2019s/Women\u2019s Retreat\n*Prism Retreat for LGBTQ+ students\n\nThese are hosted at our wonderful retreat house in Goshen. The view is breathtaking, and the food is delicious. These retreats don\u2019t care what religion you subscribe to for the most part, the point is enriching what you have faith in, whatever that may be. \n\nIn addition to that, we have a Praise and Worship team which I help lead. Basically, every Wednesday, we have Eucharistic Adoration, but we also have time to hear from a student reflector, and listen to contemporary Christian music! This is a great time for Catholics, Protestants or those who just enjoy a good time to relax, meet other people and hone in on the important parts of their Fordham journey. Many joke that our services are borderline Protestant because of the music we play!!\n\nIn terms of theology classes, your faith and critical reasoning class you take will be kind of like a broad survey of what faith and religion means in the world today. Depending on your teacher it may be oriented more towards a Catholic view. But don\u2019t fret! There are so many people here that don\u2019t identify as Catholic or even with faith in general that enjoy these classes!\n\nI congratulate you all on your merits so far! If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to DM me. Go Rams!!",

I do not know if this is a mandatory or optional summer assignment, or if I am required to register for the class sessions that are listed in the email. Can anyone give me more information as to what this is?

My class\u2019s book was \u201cThe Magicians\u201d and most people didn\u2019t even purchase it, let alone read the whole thing.\n\nTLDR it\u2019s just to help foster discussions during orientation when you meet your fellow students in August.",

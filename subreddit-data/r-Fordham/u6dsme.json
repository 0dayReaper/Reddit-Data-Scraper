    "postText": "Hi, I'm a first-year female student RH looking to live off-campus the 2022-2023 school and make rent cheaper by splitting a two or three bedroom apartment with some roommates. I also wouldn\u2019t mind living a little closer to Lincoln center if you\u2019re going to LC. My budget would be around up to $1200 a month and anything less. Feel free to reach out if you have a similar idea!2014485076",

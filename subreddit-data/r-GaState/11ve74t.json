It sounds like GSU doesn\u2019t allow non art students to use any ceramic facilities?\n\nLooking to better my pottery skills but having a hard time finding an affordable way to do that in the city. It\u2019s like hundreds of dollars for access to a class, if spots are available. Lemme know if we can chat!",

If you're able to dish out $155 a month, you have access to all their tools, wheels, glazes, kilns, etc. You just have to buy clay. They work on a membership basis. So you just pay a monthly fee, which allows you to go to the studio anytime you want to practice.",

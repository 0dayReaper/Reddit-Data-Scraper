    "postText": "I didnt get HOPE in high school, but now have attempted 30 credit hours which was above the 3.0 GPA. I have a 3.63, but I\u2019m not eligible for hope because they didn\u2019t count my 1st semester. I took 15 credits in Semester 1 and 16 in Semester 2. Do they only count Semester 2 for HOPE??? I\u2019m kinda panicking because I was told was you get 30 attempted credit hours and I have 31.",

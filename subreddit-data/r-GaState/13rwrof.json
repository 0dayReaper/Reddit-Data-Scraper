    "postText": "I\u2019m trying to complete an EFC Appeal Form, but it requires a signature from a parent. For the parent to sign, they need an E-sign PIN. However, my mother forgot hers. I have talked to Financial Aid, and they\u2019ve just tried to reset her password, which didn\u2019t work. Eventually, they contacted someone related to FAFSA(?), and I was told to watch my email for updates. I just wanted to know if anyone else has ever been in this predicament, or is it just me?",

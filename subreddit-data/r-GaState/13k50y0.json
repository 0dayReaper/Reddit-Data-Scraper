Also khan academy\u2019s website/app has modules which are really good also. But the biggest thing is just making sure you\u2019re studying a few hours each day",

I\u2019ve taken 2 of his classes already and have learned a lot. Unless you are going into healthcare or just really love Microbiology, take any other professor. But he\u2019s great if you want to push yourself and challenge yourself!",

            "comment": "I took her last spring and shes not a good teacher, I would say that was the worst class academically for me which is funny because having taken bio/chem, I didnt think genetics would be that class.\n\nShe has online work but most of the grade is the tests you take. I had a hard time with her teaching style and found that she favors some students over others. She has some biases that i noticed throughout the semester but was confirmed in the end.\n \nThe only advice I have is to come to class since she has participation/classwork points and go over the PowerPoints question you might see similar questions on test. \n\nIf you can find other profs take them, i realized that most of the learning was self taught since she just doesn\u2019t have a good teaching style which is v interesting given that she goes over PPT every class.\n\nEdit: Totally misread the post and didnt see the class, hopefully shes a better teacher in that course??",

If you need anything or don\u2019t understand something, just ask. She will stay back to explain to you. The thing I was struggling with the most was she has a very thick accent that\u2019s most of the time very hard to understand. I often zone out a lot because I couldn\u2019t understand. Her slides are extremely long too and her tests are very specific and worded weirdly sometimes. But, she gives quizzes that are open notes and a lot of the questions on the quizzes are also on the exams, so it makes it a lot easier. She also gives a lot of homework online but she gives us the whole semester to do. It isn\u2019t too bad. Microbiology is a very hard class to begin with but my experience with her was positive. The textbook also helped me a lot.",

    "postText": "So I was a CS major but because of my consistently failing GPA, I have to switch. I wanted to switch to Computer information systems. But there is a GPA requirement that I'm not meeting. Don't judge. I know CIS is like CS + business so I was thinking maybe I could switch to business, bring my GPA up and then eventually switch to CIS. I thought the beginners classes for business majors would be similar to the beginners classes for CIS. Maybe I could work out a way to only take classes I need for CIS even while I'm a business major and then eventually switch to CIS. If you're a business or CIS major, please help me out. Is this possible? Are the beginners/prerequisite classes for both majors similar in any way?",

And if you haven't taken accounting 1&amp;2, macro, or micro econ yet, you will have to take those classes also. CIS requires cis 3260 as an entry class, i don't think that class have any gpa restriction.",

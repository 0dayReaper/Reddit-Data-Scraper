    "postText": "Thought I'd post here in case anyone's hurrying to fulfill graduation reqs.\n\nI studied daily for about a month leading up to the exam. Got a CLEP voucher after completing the [ModernStates.org](https://ModernStates.org) course in American Government (you can breeze through the course, it's not hard). In the week and a half before the exam, I took practice exams through [REA.com](https://REA.com) , through Peterson's, and through FreeClepPrep.\n\nI started with Quizlet decks that someone else made, but slowly added missed questions from the various practice exams. Those decks are here: [https://quizlet.com/780811884/clep-exam-american-government-ii-flash-cards/](https://quizlet.com/780811884/clep-exam-american-government-ii-flash-cards/) and here: [https://quizlet.com/778684386/clep-exam-american-government-flash-cards/](https://quizlet.com/778684386/clep-exam-american-government-flash-cards/). Some of them have mnemonic photos (IE if the answer was \"Article Three,\" the memory-jogging photo was a pic of three cows).\n\nI did not watch the crash course Youtube series on American Government. All in all I spent less than $50 on preparation, there was no essay involved, and now I don't have to take POLS 1101. I got discouraged when I read that AmGov is one of the harder exams, but honestly? Take it. Study for a month. You'll be fine.",

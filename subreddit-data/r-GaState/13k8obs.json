If, at the end of summer new student orientation, those seats are still available, they\u2019ll open them for the waitlist. Typically it\u2019s 1 or 2 seats that open at a time, but if there\u2019s a class that 24 summer success academy students didn\u2019t sign up for, then they\u2019ll open all the remaining seats. \n\nSo, really up for grabs, get on the waitlist but have a plan b class you\u2019re for sure registered for in case waitlisting falls thru",

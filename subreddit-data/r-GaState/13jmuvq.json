It isn't like calculus or algebra where you have a function and you find x or plug in a value, you prove why things are true. \n\nFor example, in 2212 you use the formula for the sum of the geometric series however in 2420 you prove why that formula is true. It is a different type of math.",

They cover similar, but slightly different topics.\n\nDepending on who your professor is, you'll be using Cengage where there will be 5+ assignments due each week, homework and quizzes. Note Cengage is not the easiest to use, i.e. it can and will mark things incorrect for missing a space or a comma. You will be devoting a lot of time to just this one course especially the in class assignments.",

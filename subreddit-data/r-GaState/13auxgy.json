You'll have four \"success\" tests, you'll have three attempts with each one, my advice is to do one attempt the best you can, and then look at the answers and get 100. You have diagnostic quizzes, you have to take before You do the actual homework, if you get 100 on them you don't have to do the homework, just the quiz associated with that. I suggest investing in math way it makes some of the math easier. Overall is not too bad. This class is more simple definitely, but with algebra 1111, it gets frustrating to keep both homeworks from both classes",

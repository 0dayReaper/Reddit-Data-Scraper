    "postText": "Hi! I'm planning on taking JOUR 1010 in the fall and a few of the professors don't have ratings on rate my professor yet. Right now my options are Tira Murray, Todd Duncan, Mark Shavin, and Helen Cauley. Does anyone who's taken this class before have any suggestions on who is the best, or who I should avoid? Any help is appreciated :)",

            "comment": "MARK SHAVIN 100%!! He\u2019s a really great and witty professor. Another great plus is that he\u2019s an extremely experienced professor, so almost any advice you may need, he\u2019ll give you really great insight to what its like to be an actual journalist. Assignments aren\u2019t hard at all, however, he is strict when it comes to deadlines, he doesn\u2019t accept late work as he wants his students to feel as though they\u2019re actually in the industry. \n\nI haven\u2019t taken Helen Cauley yet (im taking her for the upcoming fall semester) BUT I have heard she is also a really good professor.\n\nThe fall 2023 semester will be Tira Murray\u2019s first time teaching JOUR1010, but I\u2019ve met her once and she is really nice. \n\nIf you have any questions, you can message me and I wouldn\u2019t mind helping! :)",

She knows the topic well. I wouldn\u2019t say she\u2019s a mean professor but she definitely isn\u2019t a pushover, but her class is easy enough as long as you come to class with the readings done. Also most of the grades are open note quizzes on grammar (4) and Ap style  (4) , and then the written news stories. (But that might be for the class regardless of professor)",

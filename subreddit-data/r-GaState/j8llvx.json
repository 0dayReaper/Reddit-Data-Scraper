    "postText": "hey all,\n\ni\u2019ve been attending GSU for three years and i am as a grown person only now realizing that atlanta has an intense homelessness epidemic. while i realize that the austerity of atlanta housing legislation has allowed developers to push thousands of black families into the streets without any recourse for the past decade, i think this is most hard for me because i have to see them be poor in my general periphery. \n\nwhen will the police clean out the streets of these poors and just take them somewhere else once and for all? i would like to live in a rapidly gentrifying city plagued by corrupt development schemes but never have to reckon with any of that or my role in it.\n\nthanks!",

Some who are legit screwed by the system like social security. Some avoiding the shelters for reasons (mostly because its risky AF) you get your stuff stolen, you stay too long (and sometimes if you meet a certain income)they see its your time to go. Apartments are hard to find in the city that accepts minimum wage and often having to travel out to find cheap rent. Between those two factors its a catch 22. You make too much to stay in a shelter and you make too little to rent an apartment. I have been in the same position and thank god I was able to stay with my grandmother till I was able to get off my feet. But if homelessness bothers you so much you can talk to officials and make a change. Tell them about the different programs that are still avalible to get a certification. But please do not look down on someone based on how they look or how little they have...",

There are so many programs and organizations that are willing to help and house people to prevent them from staying on the streets.\n\nMy family is from the Philippines and homeless is a huge problem there. There's hardly any programs to help people get back on their feet and if there is you basically have no chance of receiving aid since the demand is so high. It's also not a very high priority for the government to do anything about it. \n\nI've thankfully never been in a situation where I had to become homeless though I did certainly come close before. Maybe it's just cause I've never personally experienced homeless here that I don't understand how it is here in America.",

The student's are their responsibility. Are you that sensitive that asking for a safer campus is an unrealistic request? You might be in your warm cozy bed tabbing through zoom lectures while there are students who have to come to campus during this pandemic to attend their classes. It's abhorrent that hardworking, paying students have to feel unsafe on campus.

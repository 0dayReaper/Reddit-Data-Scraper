    "postText": "Hey,\n\nAny F1 student at GSU who worked on Co-Ops? I am not sure how it works for us, I know we can work full-time in summer, but how will that work in Fall/Spring semester? Do we take full-time classes to maintain the F1 status and work full-time or do we skip a semester and work full-time?\n\nPlease enlighten me on this. I would really appreciate your help.\n\nThanks.",

Don\u2019t wait until it opens up for you to resolve any holds. stuff like immunization and PRG holds take a few days to process. Now (or the week we get back, if you have already checked out \ud83d\ude2d)  is the time to send in your panther answer tickets or try to find an advisor for advise. It\u2019ll save you the headache of tryna do it whenever else is!",

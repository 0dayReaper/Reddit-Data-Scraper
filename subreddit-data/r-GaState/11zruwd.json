    "postText": "I reallllyyyyy need help , i\u2019m stuck between ksu and gsu. Im an incoming freshman and I\u2019ll be majoring in nursing. I really want to know which school is better for me to go to:\u201d) I probably will have to commute but the only issue is , I don\u2019t really know how to drive (yeah ik it\u2019s sad , but im slowly learning). Dorming sounds too expensive , and my parents don\u2019t want me to leave either. I\u2019ve been on a campus tour for gsu and I liked the atmosphere of it but I just need some advice. KSU is obviously cheaper but a bit farther from where I live. I also don\u2019t know if the job opportunities are the same :/ I just need some help lol.",

            "comment": "If you start off at GSU's Perimeter campus, it's cheaper than KSU and GSU's Atlanta campus. They have a lot of online options so you might be able to avoid commuting. Also, see what financial aid you may qualify for. You can then transition to the Atlanta campus or transfer to KSU when you start your nursing major classes. You could probably earn your associate's in nursing (ASN) at the Perimeter campus first on the way to earning your BSN. GSU also has an online RN to BSN program.\n\nBoth nursing programs are good and both have good job opportunities so in the end, you should pick the school most convenient for you.",

            "comment": "I recommend going to a community college thats a state school or go to perimeter campus then decide if you want to transfer. Earn your associates first. Driving in downtown is not bad except on the first day of classes and if you learn to drive in downtown atl, you can honestly drive almost anywhere else. I'm technically am a freshman, and i was forced to learn how to drive downtown since I did F2F classes.\n\nIf you want more of the traditional college experience, I'd go with KSU. If you want to have cheaper school, GSU is the place to go. Both are good schools.",

Then you can apply and if they like your application then you can move onto interviews where they make you do a project (yes for a job interview) as well as the interview itself. Needless to say I didn't get the gig and busted my ass to do so. They really screwed me in my point of view, wasted my time and didnt pay me for it. That was a hard lesson to learn tbh.",

After all Resident Assistants are to take care of resident\u2019s needs and emergencies. \n\nIf you have any grievances, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong to not get the gig. To be successful at the hiring process you need excellent recommendations from professional housing staff anyways, just like most places it\u2019s all about networking. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t really tell our mentees to \u201csuck up\u201d on our bosses can we",

I will say I did like a few of the exercises but it was a hurdle i had to jump through that showed me that my time was not valued. What was done with the training and forcing me to do a project (which the people loved btw I did a great job) and then not even having the full time for me to go through the hiring processes questions with me was just genuinely disrespectful. Yall have a professional environment and I understand that you saw what you did as professional but I have never felt more strung along and mistreated in quite some time. It did teach me valuable lessons in the areas of what i would not put up with in a work environment but it was a hard one. I dont feel animosity towards you personally, please understand that, but I was horribly disrespected in your organizations processes and it cost me hours upon hours of my time. I had great staff recommendations actually and I presented myself as a great hire after going through weeks of your training and doing all the necessary steps so I did everything correct but was not even given the decency to be heard out properly with questions besides the essays I had to fill out on your forms that were completely out of left field. Your organizations hiring processes is one of the most disrespectful and disingenuous things I have ever had to go through for a position that was dangled in front me. It taught me a lesson that I needed and will not forget but i will not forget the treatment I received. I even got a really snarky email from someone in the organization at one point when all I was trying to do in the situation was help. I understand that you would like to explain but there is no covering for the absolute disrespect that was given to me by your team under the guise of smiles and mandated kindness. You should have in the least given the training to people who got the job and at least supplied food if not monetary compensation for it. My time was precious to me but it was not to yall and that will not be flying for me ever again.",

I agree the leadership is really gloss over. Please email Taylor White about your experience about this no one else as most housing staff don\u2019t really care about bettering LEAP. You should be where you are celebrated and not tolerated. I left housing for being an underpaid employee, honestly to OP and you; I really don\u2019t recommend working in Housing unless you are financially stable or can balance a second/third job.",

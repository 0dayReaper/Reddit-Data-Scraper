    "postText": "I am taking a class this summer to replace a grade I got a few semesters ago. Will this class grade also go towards my summer semester gpa or will it only replace the old class grade? I need this class for an elective credit and a minor credit as well so I need to retake it, but the repeat to replace guidelines don\u2019t state if it\u2019ll also apply to my semester gpa. This might be a DUMB question, but I\u2019m concerned about my SAP \ud83d\ude2a",

            "comment": "Your semester gpa is made of the classes you take that semester, including repeat to replace. It will count either for the minor or the elective but not both. Repeat to replace will impact only your institutional gpa, not your financial aid gpa",

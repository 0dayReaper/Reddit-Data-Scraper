I know there are express bus routes but they are park and ride and I have no car to get to the park and ride. So\u2026 the plan is to save up money and study from home for my first 2 years and then take a bus.   I want to know if anyone else has done their first 2 years completely online and how it went.",

I did one with 12 because some of the classes I grouped under it were super easy (2 credits). Idk what your life outside GSU is like. I was working  and raising a family at the same time. If you are free of life commitments, you can do 15 credits per semester instead.",

I mean, easy classes are great, but I don\u2019t want to screw myself over with lower standards and then be lost downtown. I can only base my assumption on the difference in admission requirements. I am pretty sure Perimeter takes everyone vs downtown.",

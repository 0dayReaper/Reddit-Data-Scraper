The typical admit to GSU's Atlanta Campus had a high school GPA of 3.6.\n\nContrary to what a shocking number of you believe, GSU does not \"let everyone in\" or \"accept anyone with a pulse\".",

In fact, the typical GPA has steadily increased over the past decade or so, the acceptance rate has steadily decreased, and the number of applicants has also steadily increased (that very well could change for next year).\n\nSure, grade inflation has probably contributed to some of that GPA increase, but typical SAT/ACT scores of GSU admits have increased steadily as well, which would indicate that GSU students as whole are in fact more prepared for college than ever before.\n\nIf you came to GSU from a highly-competitive high school in the north Atlanta suburbs (for example) where everyone had a 4.0 GPA, then GSU by comparison may have felt like a \"2.5 GPA\" school.",

GSU is never going to be a UGA/GT/Emory caliber school, and that's totally fine. GSU *should* embrace its niche as an accessible, diverse institution which serves as an engine of economic mobility.\n\nI personally do not and would not take issue with having graduated from a university with a 100% acceptance rate (which GSU's Atlanta campus is not), though I understand others would. I *do* take issue with obvious misinformation, as users of the US News and World Report website (and others) will assume that GSU's 4-year Atlanta campus actually has an acceptance rate of 100%, which is false. It is more difficult for GSU to fulfill its role as a vector for advancement of low-income kids into the middle class if companies are unnecessarily skeptical of those kids' degrees.",

One of the largest issues concerning college culture in our country is our over emphasis on prestige. Especially with recent data showing that after 10 years in a field, salaries even out. Because the ties some universities provide only give you an early boost if you haven\u2019t developed the personality or skill set to advance yourself.\n\nIn short, why on Earth would you pay boatloads more money to go somewhere for name rec upon graduation if another institution can offer you the same or similar at a much cheaper price. This isn\u2019t the 1980s anymore: employers do not (largely) care where your degree is from, they care whether or not you can do the job.\n\n\nI\u2019ve been in admissions over a decade now and have attended smaller regional schools. I\u2019ve largely worked with underprivileged, poor and mostly minority kids. Trying to navigate them through to just find the best fit, even if it wasn\u2019t where I was working at the time. I hate the way we as a country, talk down on schools that aren\u2019t Top 50. It\u2019s time to get out of that mindset. You can get a PhD from GSU or West Georgia or UGA and they\u2019ll still call you Doctor at the end of the day.",

I only blamed myself but it got to the point where I was losing money and was desperate for something new. I then decided to apply to a number of colleges. My HS GPA was abysmal (somewhere around 2.1 range). When I got accepted at GSU I felt like I had received a second chance. \n\nHere it is, almost 5 years later and I\u2019m gonna graduate next year with my nursing degree. I\u2019ve busted my ass for this degree more than anything else in life. It\u2019s brought me greater purpose, a greater sense of worth, and more confidence in myself.

    "postText": "So I switched majors recently back to Computer Information Systems, I would wonder how long would it take to get back for cross-level registration. Because we start our summer 2023 semester this upcoming Monday and I am wondering if would I have been too late to take Accounting 1 and Elementary Stats since I know Summer Semester is wayyy fast than a normal semester. My advisor had just gotten my form yesterday.",

Have you asked your advisor how quickly you will be able to register, or if they can override your registration and add the CRN on your behalf?",

Your advisor may have looked up the classes to see if any were even available, and saw that all in person were full but some online were available, but that does not mean they will register you into the classes for you. If there's 3 online classes available, 2 may be asynchronous while 1 may meet at a certain time. Picking the one that works for you is up to you.",

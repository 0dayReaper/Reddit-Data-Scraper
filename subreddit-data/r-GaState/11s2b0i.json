However, the scientific ones are usually partly hosted by Tech, Emory, or Grady. I did one with grady that paid $100 for two interviews and a blood sample. I was involved in one recently that asked me to read words and then it would eventually lead into getting a brain scan. These studies usually last months and ask for a lot of things from your body that you may not be comfortable with (urine, blood, body scanning, to use a test kit or product that might slightly alter your hormones - at least for women) or be racially concentrated. I'm black, but many black people do not like the idea of being subjects.\n\nI do them here and there and end up with a solid $50-$100 without doing many \"experimental\" things. Mostly surveys and online interviews",

They don't pay like the Tech ones but they're way less demanding and on campus. They usually pay $10-$80 which is the highest I've seen, always cash too.",

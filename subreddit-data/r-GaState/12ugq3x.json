    "postText": "Hi I am looking for a place to move into soon with these features:\n\n* Available in June\n* Year long or 6 month lease\n* less than $1300 but less than $1200 would be perfect\n* preferably no carpet because i'm an artist\n* close to a marta station or close to campus\n* walkable area would be a big plus but not 100% necessary if it's close to public transit\n* no severe pest or safety issues\n\n I am open to having roommates to increase the possibility of finding this. I'm out of state rn so I can't tour places but we can search virtually together. It would be cool to room with another artist or musician so we can use the living room as a creative space but its totally fine if our interests differ. I would prefer femme/female/ or non binary roommate(s). I'm okay with rooming with queer men as well as long as we make each other feel safe i'm all good! I'm a chill and accepting person so we could either keep to ourselves or do stuff together. I'll probably just be painting in my room, listening to music, doing yoga, or studying most of the time lol. I'm not picky about my roommate's personalities or anything as long as you are someone that respects themselves and respects the boundaries of others we're good! I want us to have a peaceful, clean, creative environment to study in and grow as people in!\n\nI am trying to stay away from places like the mix because it gets a bit too crowded during the school year.  \n\nIf you have any leads on apartment complexes, rooms for rent, lease takeovers or suggestions on places to look comment/dm!\n\nFOR POTENTIAL ROOMMATES:\n\nI have been looking at\n\n* [Skyline ATL](https://skylineatlapts.securecafe.com/onlineleasing/skyline-atl/oleapplication.aspx?stepname=floorplan&amp;myOlePropertyId=1612824&amp;UnitID=34031298) ($1,849 2b/2b so that's like $950 per person after fees) \n* [935m ARIUM](https://ariumliving.com/atlanta/west-midtown/935m-by-arium/?utm_source=PPC&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw6IiiBhAOEiwALNqncd6rRnKa6AdMNTwvMGqtPlUBtx_SrdNVVLAoedH4xVyhOLRXx4ogahoCC50QAvD_BwE) ($2,140 2b/2b so $1070 per person) \n* [Pencil Factory](https://pencilfactoryapartments.securecafe.com/onlineleasing/pencil-factory-lofts/oleapplication.aspx?_yTrackUser=MjIxOTUyNDk5NSM4NTY4NTE3NjQ%3d-C3W0zC99%2fKM%3d&amp;_yTrackVisit=MzczMjE3NDAwMSMxMzMxMTkwNTEx-E9%2bm17%2fUk9g%3d&amp;RCStandardCampaignId_1568351=456638&amp;PropLeadSource_1568351=portal&amp;stepname=RentalOptions&amp;myOlePropertyId=1568351&amp;FloorPlanID=4409270&amp;UnitID=33237975&amp;MoveInDate=4/21/2023) ($2,204 2b/2b so $1102 per person)\n\n(4x4's are okay but a 2x2 would be nice if possible.)\n\nOpen to places other than what's listed!\n\nTHANK YOU FOR ANY OF YOUR HELP IN ADVANCE!",

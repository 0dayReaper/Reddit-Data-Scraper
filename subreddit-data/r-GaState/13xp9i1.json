I made a C cause I didnt have my studenting together at that time and did not read too much. Honestly just show up and multitask during it and do the iclicker and you'll be good and get other stuff done and get the same amount from it that you would get with your undivided attention.",

One thing tho is that you should always look at how professors organize their tests and quizzes because they always stick to a certain style.",

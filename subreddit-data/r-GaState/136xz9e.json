    "postText": "I have 126 attempted hours. I still need 20 credit hours to graduate. It\u2019s 5 classes left. \n\nThe plan is to take 12 credit hours in fall semester 2023. And 8 credit hours in spring semester 2024. I will graduate next spring. \n\nI check GSU paws and for 2023-2024 financial aid it says that I have received hope scholarship for both semesters. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure this is an error? Since I have almost reached 127 attempted hours I shouldn\u2019t be receiving hope scholarship anymore. \n\nIs this happening to anyone else? I am going to reach out the GSU financial aid and ask about it. Hopefully it can be fixed. \n\nWorst case scenario is that the scholarship does apply but I\u2019ll end up paying the money back. I hope it doesn\u2019t affect my classes like them being dropped.",

Got a bill for $4k for the fall semester last week (and was told if i didn't pay i couldn't graduate), and went and talked in person and was told to apply to the emergency grant and had the bill fully covered.\n\nDefinetly try to speak in person if possible (if they're still open!). Good luck!!",

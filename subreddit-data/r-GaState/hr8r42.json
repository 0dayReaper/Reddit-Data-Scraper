Unless you wanna chance covid hits the school hard because someone doesn't want to take courses online. But I completely understand how difficult this is. But I'd say it's best for everyone to stay home or at least have attendence non-mandatory where people who don't want to risk it stay home and those who want in person materials go. Reopen school store and other stuff as well to get things going slowly and don't force everyone to go if they don't or can't.",

    "postText": "Hey I was wondering if it was okay for me to seek help here? Since I'm a student and all. I saved up around 50 bucks and need 100 more to pay off a month rent. The landlord isn't willing to wait on me to pay after the due date so I opened up emergency art commissions. If there's anyone willing to help me out it'd be very appreciated.\n\nEdit:\nI know this seems low down but I'm desperate I've been homeless before and due to my disabilities I couldn't even hold down a job long enough....I'm currently looking for remote work still hoping someone would call me though.",

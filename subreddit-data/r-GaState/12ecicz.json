    "postText": "Currently I am a senior that is part of the online program. One of my remaining classes is only held in person. I\u2019ve only been to one perimeter campus and never been to the Atlanta one. I don\u2019t have until Fall to worry about this, but what should I know about this campus? Is parking decent, is it easy to navigate inside? My class goes from 12-3:30 which I imagine traffics must suck.",

If next fall goes like this semester, you may not be able to find parking at the closer paid decks during certain times for the first few weeks until it gets to the point where people only go to campus for exams like every semester.",

Typically, you'll have to walk 5 or 10 min to get to your class. And unlike perimeter campus, they charge you for parking.",

You'll need to reload funds onto it, but using that 2 times a week for a semester is less expensive than buying a parking permit. Budget cards you load funds onto and then pay each time you park.  Free parking is at the stadium lots, which for the time of day your classes  are is a reasonable option - I wouldn't want to park there for an evening class, but midday is ok. \n\nMarta is also an option, but I'm just mentioning it because you didn't in your original post.  Again assuming 2 days per week, you'd be better off buying 10 rides at a time or the like rather than a monthly pass. \n\nOnce you know where your class is (my guess Aderhold, Classroom South, or 55 Park Place), you can make better strategy for where to park and what time you need to get there - but even if there's a location listed now, know it could change multiple times before fall semester.",

You will want to give yourself probably an hour to find parking, at least. That should improve as the semester goes along. \n\nHowever, with once a week class, you also potentially have the option of finding a non-GSU parking location close to your class.  There's not a huge amount around, but there are some.\n\nMarta is easy for me - but I live about a mile from a station, so it's easy. Gwinnett transit is an option as well, but since it's a 3 hour class once a week, those schedules might not be great either.  I just wanted to make sure I put it out in case it was a decent option for you and you hadn't considered it!",

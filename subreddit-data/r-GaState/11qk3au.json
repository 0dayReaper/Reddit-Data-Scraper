Explore things outside of the comp sci program.",

Just practice a lot of leetcode and build your own portfolio, that\u2019s what will make you employable. I spent a lot of time trying to learn about web development, cybersecurity, databases, computer networks, etc., and I found them all boring. Then I came across my favorite subject: data science. I\u2019ve spent a year learning how it works, I\u2019m working towards a certificate in data science, and the my GitHub and jobs I\u2019m applying to are all related to it. \n\nMy advise for you is to figure what you really like and become a self-taught expert on that, just being in a classroom isn\u2019t gonna be enough.",

The craziness of things dawned on me when I took CSC 1302 and the syllabus covered some random stuff that I am told is actually barely used in the industry (Swing,etc.) while at the same time not even teaching us some key things in class (the basics of classes and some other key object oriented programming concepts). I am not so far into my degree yet. However, it seems like getting ok to good grades and doing what you actually need/want to do to learn what you need to learn(whether that be based on industry requirements, personal goals, or whatever) outside class might just be the way",

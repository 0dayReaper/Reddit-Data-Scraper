    "postText": "Hey all, incoming graduate student studying Creative Writing looking for a roomate. I'm returning back to Atlanta after being away for my master's program. I'm looking to spend around 900 - 1100 in rent, but the cheaper the better. I'm open to living wherever as long as it's safe. I would prefer to live somewhere in the West Midtown, Midtown, or downtown areas.\n\nI'm a 24-year-old male. I love playing video games, reading books, listening/playing music. Clean and respectful. I don't drink much, but when I do I drink socially. We can discuss anything else as we get further along in the process. Please DM me if interested.",

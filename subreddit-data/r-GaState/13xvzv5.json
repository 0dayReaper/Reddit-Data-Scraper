    "postText": "So I am taking bio 2120 lab and lecture and I also am taking CNHP 2010 over the summer with a professor named Robin Gardenhire\u2026 has anyone taken Robin Gardenhire for medical terminology? Is she hard ? Also is taking Human anatomy 2 over the summer bad ? I need to ace these classes before Fall semester and I\u2019m nervous about them.",

I know for exercise science it would but students could petition to try a third time. However, your eval will tell you degree reqs if this is an area F course! Don\u2019t forget GSU has free tutoring over the summer and at any camps or online it\u2019s free for a student",

            "comment": "I work as an instructor at Emory and I would like to recommend applying to more than one Nursing school besides Emory. It is very expensive here (about 20-25k per semester) and you don\u2019t want to pay so much student loan debt even after you graduate. My peers who have graduated from Emory\u2019s Nursing school are still paying off their loans. My students have even told me that they wish they had gone to a smaller state college or public university. Consider all your options. A degree is a degree and will get you a job in Nursing regardless. Look into GSU, GGC, KSU as well. All the best.",

    "postText": "Hi! I got accepted into GA State and plan on transferring into GA Tech. I plan on majoring in computer science. I understand that I can't guarantee a transfer acceptance into Tech and that I could have to get my bachelor's from Ga State, and so I wanted to ask if anyone here who graduated with a CS degree can share how their career was post-grad. I'm worried about not making a good salary after I graduate if I get a CS degree from Ga State. Could you share your salary after graduating and what I can expect to be able to make? Also, I plan on going into cyber security as a career field after I graduate.\n\nI don't want to stress myself too much regarding getting in or not getting into GA Tech and I'd appreciate your guys' insight.",

Fun fact most companies don't give a shit where you go to school nowa days. On a different note beware of tech due to their mental health track record. They have a large issue with suicide and mental health due to the academic stress issues. If you do transfer have a support network in place and stay in contact with others.",

Being in a good environment where you can develop is the most important thing.\n\nUGA is more of a centrist school, and has a big sports culture. A majority of the student body is white. The campus is in a semi urban setting in the middle of Athens. They have greek life.\n\nGSU's student body is more left leaning. We are not big on sports at all, but we do have respectable teams. The campus is urban, and you will be exposed to many outside forces. The student body is VERY diverse.\n\nI don't know as much about Georgia Tech, but we get a lot of CS majors on this sub who complain about not getting in. Probably don't do that if you go to GSU. They are in midtown, but there campus is much more closed off than GSU. There greek life programs are also bigger than ours.\n\nIf going to tech is your Ultimate goal. Just save some money, and go to Georgia Gwinnett College for a year.",

For a post grad career life State vs UGA would be like comparing an apple to apple. I think ga state slight wins b/c it has more internship potential as ga state is in ATL. TBH i dont think where you go to college really effects your post grad opportunities as much as people think it does. I have friends that have a cs degree/physics degree from tech yet are still looking for a job. Yet there is me a mostly avg student with one internship(a few self made projects) and i already have a post grad opportunities lined up. Sadly it is mostly what you do in college, ur resume,and lucky that matters. Good luck wherever you go. Fyi i came to ga state with the goal of transferring, end up staying after i saw i would lose about 15 core credit. If you actually want to transfer you essentially have to stop a 1301  and discrete math as no other core cs class will transfer.",

It was easier to transfer than freshman acceptance however at that time cs dept. Didn't allow transfer students. So you should check up on that again before planning. I ended up transferring to gsu for finishing up. Now i m in grad school here and i love it. There are lots of great opportunities if you want to take advantage of.",

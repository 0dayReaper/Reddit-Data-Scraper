    "postText": "In Spring semester My gpa became a 2.9. While I have 32 attempted, only 27 of those were actually completed. Have I already hit the 30 mark? Or do I have a chance in the fall? Everyone I ask this question to gives me the run around. It still gives me the option to see and have my hope, so if it\u2019s lost when will I lose it?",

So you lost it even if it\u2019s 32 attempted credit hours. If it hasn\u2019t showed now, it probably will later. So you need to get a 3.0 back by the 60 mark to get hope again if it\u2019s actually lost",

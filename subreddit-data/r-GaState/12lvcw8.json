    "postText": "As I finish up my last semester and graduate, I wanted to offer up/share the \"Class Planner\" I designed over my GSU career that helped me plan out what classes I was going to take, and when. Perhaps it can help some others.\n\nIt's essentially a much fancier version of the paper an advisor is supposed to fill out with you about what classes you'll take, and when. I made it in Google Sheets, and stuffed it full of fancy conditional formatting and autofill features.\n\nTo use it/check it out:\n\n1. Click the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VA9iB63a8Vj8QO6doq2Qxu3JwjHnUKfapKF6AKuVCAA/\n2. Click \"File\" up in the top left corner\n3. Click \"Make a copy\"\n4. Name it whatever you want, make sure the *Folder* is set to \"My Drive\", and click \"Make a copy\"\n5. The new window that opens is your copy, you can edit/type in that one, and it is saved to your Google Sheets.\n\n**Essentially, all you need to do is type stuff in to the white boxes (and the \"Completed\" drop down menu). Those are the only places it needs human input. Everything else will auto-update.** It works by plugging in the classes you're interested in taking on the left side, and then plan out your semesters on the right side.\n\nThere's two pages. A \"Sample\" page to see how it works, and a blank \"Planner\" page where you can put all your stuff in.",

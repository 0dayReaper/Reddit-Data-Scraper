If you are putting 40 hrs a week for the internship it can be overwhelming. It is best to take a leave of absence (Just my humble opinion)!",

So, that means if there is that possibility then I would leave the current job and focus on the internship. However, if that's not the case then take a leave of absence.",

That would be the best.\n\nIf your current job requires you to quit if you take the internship then see if they are flexible and let you work other shifts, i.e., weekends and a day or two in the evenings\n\nSome questions to clarify Are both of the jobs full-time for the whole summer, and are you taking courses over the summer? Are either of the jobs on the GSU campus? Are either of the jobs in your future career path? And do you have a car/transportation to both?\n\nI'm saying It depends greatly on your time management, when they allow you to complete your schedule and how much you need both financially or for career advancement.  \n\nIn my program, competing priorities come up a lot. Deciding what gets deprioritized can be difficult, but you have to base it on known and unknown factors of major and minor importance to you and your career program.",

Since OP said they were denied a third attempt, contacting the department head won't do anything.\n\nWhat the need to do, if they are serious about passing the CLEP they should be talking to a tutor and or visiting the Mathematics Assistance Complex to prepare. There are plenty of review material out there to study. The other option is reaching out to professors for help, my current professor helps anyone that comes to office hours, even if they aren't in his class. He could be an option as well.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. I am graduating with my bachelors here in a few weeks and am more than likely going to end up at GSU for my Masters. What can I expect from the campus, social life (I get really anxious about fitting in and making friends), and other factors? I\u2019m coming from a small town school which is very different from ATL. I will be a Music Performance major if there\u2019s any music people that would like to chime in. TYIA!",

GSU is downtown so it can be a bit dangerous especially at night so it\u2019s best to leave the campus before it gets very late . Terrible advisors maybe you might get lucky and have a good advisor tho . You\u2019ll get emails about crimes, robbery and harassment happening though despite this, there\u2019s lots of things to do in downtown and lots of places to eat here around the campus so congrats and good luck",

Building community is different depending on your department but in my experience, the music grad students do a great job at building community. It\u2019s an exciting time to live in a city and Atlanta is a great place to study music!",

            "comment": "I'll be honest I was there for 4 years getting my bachelors. I was miserable. Actually miserable doesn't describe how bad it was for me. I HATED that experience. Keep in mind I was a commuter and COVID took 2 of those years. But I hated GSU so much that I was happiest when campus closed and I could stay home. Your experience won't be like mine I hope. I genuinely felt instant relief the second I walked out of my last class ever. I didn't attend my graduation as I felt no sense of accomplishment or pride and I didn't want to waste another second down at that place. \n\nPros of GSU? Cheap and accessable by train. Other than that, I think it's a shit hole. Don't get me started on the weekly emails they send out about a shooting on campus. \n\nI am SO much happier not being at GSU. But my experience isn't everyone's and I know people who enjoyed it a lot! I'm sure you'll be fine.",

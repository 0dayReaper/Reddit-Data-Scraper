    "postText": "So I applied for the honor college and I just need the letter of recommendation for it to be reviewed. My professor said they submitted it on Wednesday but the status is still marked as awaiting in the application portal. I emailed them again today so they could maybe try resubmitting it and they said ok. Does the letter need time to be processed or reviewed in order for it to be accepted?/? I thought it would be automatic since it was done via email. \n\nAnyone have any idea what\u2019s going on?/?",

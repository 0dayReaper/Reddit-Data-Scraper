    "postText": "Hello guys! I\u2019m taking ASTR 1010k, math 1111, ass well as GEOG 1101 this summer. (Won\u2019t count the support class for college algebra as it\u2019s only two credits and doesn\u2019t get counted). How difficult is my course load? The professors for algebra and astronomy are OKAY, not the best but GEOG is online and she\u2019s a good prof. I\u2019m a decent student, get work done on time, good gpa, all that stuff. But am a little bit nervous. Appreciate all the help!!",

I feel like if you\u2019re decent at math then math 1111 should be chill in the summer. Astr 1010k was pretty straightforward. And I heard geology is one of the easier sciences at GSU. So I think you will be fine",

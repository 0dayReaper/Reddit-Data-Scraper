    "postText": "I took the CLEP exams for French and American Government on March 29. Do not bother showing the candidate-side score report you\u2019ll get next-day to admissions or to your advisor. They will tell you to wait for the paper transcript.\n\nI asked when registering for the exam that my scores be sent to GSU directly, but I\u2019m paranoid and also requested a transcript copy through the CLEP/college board website the next day. My transcript was received by the admissions office 04/10. I only know this because I emailed 04/17, asking where my transcript was, and they said it was received 04/10. Wasn\u2019t reflected in DegreeWorks though.\n\nEmailed my advisor, waiting til this morning, left a message. Got an email response that credit should appear in 1-2 business days, got an email just now that the credits were applied.\n\nWorth noting: my advisor said I actually didn\u2019t need to wait for the CLEP exam credits to hit before applying to graduate. I applied for Fall 2023 graduation, completed the change of graduation date form for Summer 2023 since it\u2019s past the deadline, now everything is sorted out.\n\nAlso worth noting: I self-studied for French, the CLEP gave me 2001/2002 credit, and I insisted that I take French 1002 to round out my Area F because gosh it\u2019s been SO long since I\u2019ve been in a French class and I don\u2019t know grammar AT ALL (/s).\n\nTLDR: while you don\u2019t have to take them early on in your time at GSU, if you take the exams with a month to spare before graduation application deadline: you\u2019ll be fine. CLEP exams are easy.",

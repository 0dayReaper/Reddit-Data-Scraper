Hope checks if you meet the 3.0 threshold every 30 credit hour milestone so add up how many credits you\u2019ve taken and see where you at. Let\u2019s say if you have 80 attempted hours and ur gonna do 9 in the summer, even if ur hope gpa falls below a 3, you will have hope for that fall semester. I would double check with a financial aid advisor to be safe but your doing just fine.",

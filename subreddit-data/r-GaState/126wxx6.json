    "postText": "Signed up for fall and I am taking CIS3260 presumably aria,CIS 3001,MK 3010,and MGT 3100. How hard are these classes? After fall I only have 42 credits left and will take me 3 to 4 semesters after fall, excluding summer which I will take 6 in so 36 after to complete due to prereqs. Do I take it easy since I don't have many credits left and I wont have to take more than 12 in a semester and possibly only 9 if it takes 4 semesters or do I push one last semester with 15. The last class I'm looking to add is either HADM 3010 OR 3403.",

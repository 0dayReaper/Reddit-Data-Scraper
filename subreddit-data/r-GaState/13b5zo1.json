Also consider that it is currently over-saturated and jobs aren\u2019t easy to get. People also forget that you typically need more than a BS in PH to do certain types of work within the field. With all this in mind, the PH program at GSU was a very enjoyable experience, you get to connect with tons of great professors and get to know what branch you belong in. Not easy work but fulfilling work (in my opinion)",

Last time I checked you only needed a bachelors degree &amp; 27 semester credits in science courses to work as an environmental health specialist/country health inspector or an undergrad nutrition/dietetics degree to work as a nutritionist. You may need more than an BS for epidemiology though",

There\u2019s still a lot of work involved (ESPECIALLY papers and group projects). You still have to take plenty of maths and sciences (like epidemiology) and added electives such as health psychology or human diversity",

They don\u2019t go into public health for the money because it honestly does not pay well. It\u2019s more about doing it because you are passionate about it.",

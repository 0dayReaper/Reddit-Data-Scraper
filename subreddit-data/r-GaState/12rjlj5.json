    "postText": "Planning to take MK 3010,LGLS3610, CIS 3260,MGT 3100, and CIS 3300. I work 10-15 hrs a week during school and I have internship for winter 2024 and I planned to take 3 classes one being HADM 3010.\n\nThe other 2 classes aren't demanding but I will be working a minimum of 40 hrs a week and would like to lessen the load.\n\nMK 3010 and HADM would be asynchronous, I am also trying to get eh asynchronous version of LGLS 3610 but will have to wait and see. MGT 3100 is in person once a week, CIS 3260 AND 3300  are online with meeting times both on Tuesday.\n\nI have heard HADM 3010 is pretty easy, should I add it to this schedule to take this semsester? I should also mention there is the option to wait until Fall 2024 or Spring 2025 to take it because as it currently stands I will take 12 for tht fall and 9 for spring.",

            "comment": "I've been taking 15 hours while working 60 hours last Spring and 40 hours this semester. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spring 2023**\n\nMK3010 (the basic marketing class, right?) was online as well and included a bunch of tedious homework on Connect. Attendance not mandatory. Honestly expect to spend at least 1-2 hours just doing homework each week for it. The exams were somewhat hard. I had Yi Zhao if I remember. Super strict about Academic Honesty like you can't even have a GroupMe. DO NOT HELP ANYONE WITH HOMEWORK. Someone reported me to him for giving a homework answer and I had to take a 0 for that assignment.\n\nCIS 3620 is a joke if you're taking it with Robinson. It's extremely easy online and attendance wasn't required. He would literally give you the code for the homework at the end of class and uploaded the lecture recordings. Exams were open everything.\n\n**Fall 2023**\n\nLGLS3610 is also pretty easy. I'm taking it with Sherman now and she's actually a really good professor despite RMP. Weekly quiz (open notes) and a couple of exams. It's online and I'm only required to attend the Monday session instead of Wednesday as well. No homework or camera on. She will do breakout sessions and call on students during required session.\n\nMGT3100 is also extremely easy if you know anything about Excel. Taking this with Roth currently and it's just a bunch of GTAs who literally do the excel assignment in class with you. Allowed one cheat sheet for every exam, except you can have front+back for the final. Fair bit of homework but probably less than 1 hour. Also an excel project throughout semester.\n\nCIS3300 is online for me and attendance is required. No homework or camera on. There's a group project that you work on throughout the semester that is really easy, he honestly just gives you full points if it looks like you tried. Exams are open everything. Taking this with Martin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully this helps.",

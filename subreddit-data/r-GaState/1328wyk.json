I've never been in a place with an atmosphere as depressing as the Decatur Campus location. The Dunwoody campus, on the other hand, was nice and very clean. Best of luck.",

The roads are a bit tight. \n\nAlso, if I were you, I wouldn't bother going to the Atlanta campus. Work hard, make friends, and transfer for your last two years to UGA, etc.",

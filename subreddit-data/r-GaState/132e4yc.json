There was a customized linked with the estimated cost and your estimated aid. I went on paws portal and viewed my financial aid award and I changed the school year to 2023-2024 because it was showing old financial aid and it was all there to either accept or decline.",

But as of right now, it\u2019s around 90% and after a certain credit point (somewhere around 120+) it will only pay for a certain number of credits and be void once you reach that credit point",

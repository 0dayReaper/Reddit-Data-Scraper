Like I thought the whole reason that the Nazi's where bad was because they killed 6 million jews in the holocaust or am I missing something? Look up nick fuentes if you want to see what an actual modern day nazi is. Literally his main issue with Ben Shapiro is that he's Jewish. Just watch [this](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRasg3pU/). Until I see turning point saying that they aren't nazi's. \n\nAlso I just want to point out that being a communist is just as bad as being a nazi if not worse. Upwards of 20 million people died under stallin and around 45 million died under mao.",

And they won't, because they're too stupid.\n\nFor everyone, especially the people defending TPUSA political opinions:\n\n1. On a Sept. 2021 episode of the Charlie Kirk show, founder and spokesperson of TPUSA, Kirk called for Texas to create a \"Citizen Force\" to deport Haitians fleeing poverty. Citing that: Democratic policies immigration policies were to \"diminish and decrease white demographics in America.\" ... A view consistent with the \"White Genocide\"/\"Replacement Theory\" touted in Nazi Germany against the Jews.\n\n-- Sources -- *https://www.mediaite.com/radio/charlie-kirk-wants-to-start-a-border-militia-to-protect-white-demographics-in-america/\n *https://jewishunpacked.com/white-replacement-theorys-antisemitic-origins/\n *https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/fear-white-genocide\n\n2. Kirk defended Trump's COVID-19 response which led to nearly 600,000 dead Americans, or 300 9/11s, by the end of his term - by falsely claiming during the H1N1 pandemic it took Obama \"millions infected and over 1,000 dead to declare a public health emergency.\" Also touting \"planned vaccinations across America\" conspiracy theories.\n\n*https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/covids-toll-us-reaches-1-million-deaths-unfathomable-number-rcna22105\n\n\n*https://www.factcheck.org/2020/03/flawed-comparison-on-coronavirus-h1n1-emergency-timelines/\n\n*https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/12/biden-covid-vaccination-campaign-499278\n\n3. After the 2020 election Kirk disputed the results of the election, and that Trump had lost. A year afterwards, Jan. '21 he announced that TPUSA would be sending ~80 buses to Washington DC for January 6th to \"protest\" the results of the election. They sent 7 buses with 350 people. This rally ended in a riot and an attack of the U.S. Capitol. Kirk later said it was a decision made in \"bad judgement.\"\n\n*https://www.dailydot.com/debug/charlie-kirk-delete-tweet-buses-capitol/\n\n*https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/capitol-rally-organizers-before-riots/2021/01/16/c5b40250-552d-11eb-a931-5b162d0d033d_story.html\n\n4. Kirk said that the southern US border mattered considerably more than Russia's invasion of Ukraine because \"it's just a border dispute\" and  \"2 million people waltzed into our borders last year\".\n\n*https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/charlie-kirk-barely-out-duels-ted-cruz-for-worst-cpac-ukraine-take-1312189/",

UC Davis pepper sprayed and arrested 10 students for demonstrating. Try walking in the library and standing around cussing out whoever walks by for an hour.

Fascism is rising from conservative America, and the people who aren\u2019t willfully choosing to stay ignorant of it are not wrong to resist that. It\u2019s something Americans used to agree on until many left the table of reason.",

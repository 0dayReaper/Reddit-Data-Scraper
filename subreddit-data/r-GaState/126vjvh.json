    "postText": "PAWs has not been updated to reflect summer classes yet so I'm not sure what my status is, but I'm in a bit of a weird situation and was hoping someone here knows the answer.\n\nThis spring semester I'll have finished my associates at Perimeter. I transitioned to Atlanta campus and upon reviewing my updated academic evaluation, I needed MATH 2641 and CHEM 1211 (and lab). I prefer to take these at Perimeter, so I delayed my transition after my cross level was denied due to not taking at least 12 credit hours at Atlanta campus. Now, for Pell Grant, I know that the courses need to align with your degree at least part-time (6 credit hours) for you to be awarded but at Perimeter, these would be considered \"extra\" for now until I transfer to Atlanta. So how does my situation play out? I'm patiently waiting for PAWs to update but I fear it might be too late at that point to make any changes.",

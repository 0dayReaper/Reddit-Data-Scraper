Peachtree Center is a lower-activity station and is considered more safer than Five Points.\n\nThe last train from the airport is at 1am, and it only comes every 20 minutes after 9pm or something.  Make sure you get to the airport station quickly or you'll be stuck at the airport.",

If they transfer to the Westbound train on accident, they\u2019re screwed.  Better to get off at Peachtree Center which is the same distance as the GSU station",

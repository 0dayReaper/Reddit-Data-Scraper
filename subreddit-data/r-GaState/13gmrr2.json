Feel free to share the debt you graduated/will graduate with, include your major, how long it took, in-state/out of state, etc. \n\nI will graduate in Dec 2023 with a criminal justice major. It took me about 4.5 years and I\u2019m in state however I didn\u2019t have HOPE for my first 30 credits. Coming out with around ~$22k and I dormed my freshman year but COVID forced us to move out and go online that year.",

I'll probably exceed the maximum credits that HOPE covers during my last semester, but I may receive Pell Grant this year, since my dad retired a few years ago and has practically 0 income, so I may be fortunate enough to leave debt free, or mostly debt free. \n\nI'm a physics major. I'd love to double major in another life lol. I work ~23-30 hours a week, but I used to work more with a second job. It's hard, and I'm not sure how well I'll sustain it in the future.",

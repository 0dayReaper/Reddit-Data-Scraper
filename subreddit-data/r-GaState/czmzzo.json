Not much to it, other than every success during your time at GSU is thanks to Aderhold Cat's blessing. Other examples [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaState/comments/68c5rr/aderhold_cat_watches_aderhold_cat_knows/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaState/comments/8d8j0s/upvote_aderhold_cat_to_ace_all_your_finals/).\n\n(But really, it's the orange and white kitty that lives in the building across from Aderhold. Likes to hang out in the sun and keep watch over downtown, sending good vibes during finals week especially. It's a good luck sign to see Aderhold Cat.)",

    "postText": "Hello, I just ordered my cap and gown but it came in the wrong size. I went to exchange it at the bookstore but they didn't have anything in my size. The gowns are organized by length/height so I need something taller.  I currently have a 5'8\" and I'm looking for a gown in the 5'10\" - 6'0\" range.\n\nLet me know what size you have and if you're willing to trade. We can meet up somewhere on campus to swap. Thanks",

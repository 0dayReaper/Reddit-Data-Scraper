    "postText": "I have a couple questions regarding panther pantry for anyone who\u2019s ever used it:\n\n-What is given in the different food bag options?\n\n-I heard that you can only get one once a week. Does that mean that the food provided should last for a week?\n\n-Do they stay open during breaks? (Spring Break for example)\n\n-Are there certain requirements I would have to meet to be able to receive food bags? \n\nI appreciate it.",

            "comment": "Hi, \n\n- There are two are two different food bag options. There is a standard bag and vegetarian bag. I\u2019m not sure about what is inside the vegetarian bag, but I know the standard bag can have different things such as Tortillas, beans, canned meat such as chicken, spam, or tuna, rice, Mac and Cheese, oatmeal and quick grits packets, dry pasta, pasta sauce, juice/water, cereal and breakfast bars. The bag can differ each week. \n\n- Yes you can only get one bag per week and it\u2019s made to last you a week, but if you get a bag and feel as if you might need extra there is a box at the end of the pantry that a grab and go and you can grab from there.  Sometimes they have the pantry plates available as well. They are microwaveable meals and the meal can differentiate every day, I\u2019ve had some and they are honestly pretty good. Also when available, they offer fresh veggies and fruits and you are able to take as many as you want.\n\n-Sometimes the hours of the pantry differs so it\u2019s best to check in to see which days or holidays they will be open. They update their times regularly on social media, but if you are not able to access it that way you can always email them and they reply relatively quick. \n\n-There is no obscene requirement to visit the pantry. The only requirements is that you must be a GSU Student, Faculty, and staff, bring your Panther ID, and fill out a pantry pickup form. \n\nHope this helps !",

So they way it works, their needs to be NO Atlanta campus students on the waitlist for housing for any perimeter student to get housing. Atlanta campus students are prioritized over all other students.",

If you do Perimeter at Dunwoody you can get an apartment for cheaper (600 for shared) or solo for 900. There are places in Norcross which is near that campus.",

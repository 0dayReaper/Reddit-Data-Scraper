Some people don't have that opportunity.

I failed a course and lost my scholarship because of a disorganized professor. \n\nWhile I'm sure there are plenty of lazy people, just because some are dependant on getting a refund doesn't mean all they do is consume and complain. \n\nJust seems like a very closed minded way of thinking but hey, to each their own. \n\nCheers \ud83d\udc4d",

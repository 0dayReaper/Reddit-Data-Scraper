They are not program specific but more or less, with a stipend that smaller than expected, how do you afford rent in ATL? Did you take on additional loans? Did you get an additional job? Or both? \n\nI want to accept my admissions but fear the cost of living may deter me. \n\nThanks!",

The big ticket item is the tuition waiver which covers almost everything tuition wise except student fees. My advice would be to either work a part time job or take out a loan for the SMALLEST amount you can budget and still cover housing and food. \n\nFor rent, I would check out if you can get in touch with some of you peers for the incoming class and see if you can find a group to room with. \n\nAgain, the stipend is not anything meaningful. The tuition waiver is the money saver.",

You could get a job but being a full time grad student, while also working a job, while also being a GRA is tough. Taking out additional loans is an option, but I didn\u2019t do that because I didn\u2019t want to dig myself into a deeper hole of student loan debt. By living at home and working as a GRA, I\u2019ve saved tonsss. I understand that\u2019s not an option for everyone though. You may also want to consider getting a roommate.",

I\u2019ve exhausted all loans and emergency requests on rent and circumstantial events alone - plus I\u2019m from out of state with no family help. So if you do decide to accept your admissions please have a solid support system to back you so that you can focus on your rigorous graduate studies instead of how to obtain your basic needs.",

            "comment": "I agree with most everyone else here. A masters stipend, either GRA or GTA, is not going to be enough to live off of if you are paying any kind of rent. I would definitely recommend trying to get in touch with other graduate students in your department to see what housing options they have pursued. I know of several groups that are splitting a townhouse/house with a number of others to keep rent affordable. Also, I recommend finding a small part time to work during the week/on weekends. It is usually not to difficult to do as long as you maintain a good school/work balance.",

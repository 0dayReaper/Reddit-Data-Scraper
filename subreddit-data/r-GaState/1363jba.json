            "comment": "Hello, I took classes at the perimeter college for my CS associates but later transferred to Atlanta for my Bachelor's.  \nHere is what my schedule looked like for the first year\n\nFirst Semester:  \nMATH 1113 - Precal\n\nPSYC 1101 - Intro to General Psychology\n\nENGL 1101 - English Composition I\n\nPOLS 1101 - American Government  \n\n\nSecond Semester:\n\nMATH 2211 - Calculus of One Variable I\n\nENGL 1102 - English Composition II\n\nCSC 1301 - Principles of Computer Sci I\n\nHIST 1112 - World History\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was looking up a lot of the classes through registration, most of them are offered online. They were mainly asynchronous classes which meant you did the work for the week at your pace and turn in assignments for that week. I took a lot of classes online because this was during the pandemic. Of course, if you had taken any AP classes, this schedule might change for you. You are not allowed to take CSC 1301 until you take MATH 1113. You are not required to take algebra BUT it is a prereq for Math 1113. I did not take algebra because I asked my advisor if I can take a test to put me into precal. I do not know if you can skip precal, but I would talk to your advisor about it. If you have any more questions, I will do my best to answer them.",

                            "comment": "Yes, I did take calc2 right after calc1 but I took it in the fall semester of my second year. I did not take any summer classes because I was still adjusting to college life even though we were still in a pandemic at the time. I decided to pick up a part time job in the summer. If you are wanting to go transfer to another college as soon as you can, you can choose to take summer classes. Talk to your advisor for help, but sometimes they can screw you over so check the course catalog to see what classes you need. If you are planning to go for bachelor\u2019s at GSU, what I did was use the \u201cwhat-if\u201d function on your paws account and saw what other classes I had to take. I believe classes under the level 3000 are offered at perimeter. I took as many courses that also applied for my bachelor\u2019s as much as I can to save money. Sometimes your financial aid might not count the extra classes that apply to your bachelor\u2019s degree, but I forgot how mine worked out.\n\nNote: Calc2 is difficult. I would suggest, if you can, trying to place into Calc1 so you won\u2019t have to take precal. That way you can have Calc1 and Calc2 back to back. Or you can choose to take calc1 for spring semester and take calc2 for summer. Also use ratemyprofessor to see how different professors are. It can save you from getting a horrible Professor. I always use it and MOST of the time, the professors with the best ratings I signed up for, are really great and approachable.\n\nAnother Note: It is wayyyy easier to reach out to your professors (mainly in person) at the perimeter campus compared to the Atlanta campus. You have a smaller class size so it\u2019s easier for you to reach them and have more time with them. I suggest if you\u2019re wanting recommendations, interacting with your professors at the perimeter campus. This was just my experience though :)",

            "comment": "FYI - Math 1113 can be taken with CSC 1301 in the same semester per the course catalog (that is the co-requisite part stated below).  The poster is correct that Math 1111 is a prerequisite for Math 1113.  You can take the Accuplacer for Math placement test and exempt pre-requisites as well up to Math 2211 (Calc 1).   AP Scores on Calc AB/BC of 3 or higher will also exempt the pre-requisites.  \n\nCSC 1301 - PRINCIPLES OF COMPUTER SCI I\n\n\r  \nPrinciples of Computer Science I. Prerequisite or co-requisite: Math 1112 or Math 1113 with a C or higher, or appropriate math placement score. Only for majors in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics or Engineering, or minor in Computer Science. This course is an introduction to the fundamental principles of programming and data analysis in computer science. It emphasizes structured, top-down development and testing of computer programs. The course includes an overview of computers and programming; problem solving and algorithm development; basic data types; arithmetic and logic operators; selection structures; repetition structures; text files; arrays; procedural abstraction and software design. Course includes lab portion.\r  \n4.000 Credit hours",

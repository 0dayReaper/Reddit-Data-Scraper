    "postText": "Hi! I transferred out of state my freshman year and I only submitted one transcript from my first semester to the school I am transferring to. But since I didn't do any enrollment or housing following up gsu kept bugging me by calling me and I told them twice I was transferring. So they deleted my paws and student account after spring semester and I have no access. Looking through the gsu pages there was a 3rd party request option which I read and assumed it meant for getting your transcript if you lost your paws account but were a student. Is there any way I don't have to fill and send this form out or is this the only way for me to get my 2 semesters worth of a shit gpa transcript with one fucking withdrawl.",

    "postText": "Hey guys I\u2019m trying to decide on FLME 1010 and 2700. I\u2019m looking for a low stressed course  so i can focus on my harder courses. I heard 2700 is a lot of reading besides watching movies. I haven\u2019t heard much about 1010 so I would appreciate it if you tell me what\u2019s best and easier and what\u2019s the difference btw the both of them . Thanks in advhace",

Each week we had to do a simple one page summary of reading and attendance wasn\u2019t mandatory. He also had study guide that were identical to the test but he had 10 questions on every test that were from class discussion.",

The majority of the class is where you pick a significant film in your life that was released before 2013 and have different assignments regarding it. It has been a nice easy class with me taking 18 credit hours this semester. There isn\u2019t any online meetings that you have to attend either.",

She also seems like a really understanding individual. She pushed back the deadline for a bibliography that we had weeks to do. The assignment was just finding 4 or 5 sources on the film you picked and putting them in MLA format. There are no exams or quizzes as of yet. I think in total we have three 1-2 page doubled space essays and a bibliography. I definitely would suggest her class!",

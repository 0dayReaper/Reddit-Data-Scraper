    "postText": "I'm a transition student from the perimeter campus transitioning to the atlanta campus in the fall semester of 2023 and I just put in my application. I haven't completed my fafsa yet so I was wondering if I should only do that once I get accepted or if I should just fill it out now. I'm worried because I already missed the priority deadline and the final deadline (june 30th) is coming soon, so if I wait till I get approved I don't know if I'll be able to complete my file in time.  \n\n\nAlso, I'm worried that by the time I get accepted and need to register for classes all the classes I need will be filled up by then. Does anyone have any advice? Is there anything I can even do if my classes are filled up? (For reference I'm a Comp Sci major needing to take Principles of comp sci 2, theor foundations of comp sci, and intro to geology 2)",

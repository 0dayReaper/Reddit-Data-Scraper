I got an A on every single exam with these notes for anyone taking these classes in the summer/fall. They\u2019re very detailed and will save you hours of studying, you also won\u2019t need to purchase the textbook for LGLS and MGT3400, but MGT3100 requires an access code. PM me if you\u2019re interested!",

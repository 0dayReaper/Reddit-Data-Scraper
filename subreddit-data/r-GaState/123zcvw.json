I\u2019d say learning is probably the easiest, as the concepts are less abstract than in cog psych and you don\u2019t have to worry about biological mechanisms. If ur more into clinical psych stuff then either learning or physio. \nThink about what interests you and let that guide you. Usually what you enjoy will be easier.",

If you are comfortable at all w physio psych, I recommend taking Dr. Rebecca Roberts. Only graded on tests and open note, albeit there are short answer questions so you still have to understand concepts and be able to apply them",

There were assigned readings and a lecture video around 40 minutes. I am not going to lie, there is likely not a large difference in difficulty for the advanced 4000 course, hence the advanced component.",

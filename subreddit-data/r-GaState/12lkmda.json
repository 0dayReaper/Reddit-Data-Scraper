    "postText": "I did the math and if i were to get a 100 on the thesis and second exam (which I probably won't), I could probably end up in the mid-high 60s. This is one of my major classes (Film CTW) which requires a C- at best, so I would have to retake it anyways. Since GPA is on a 4.0 scale, it would end up being a 1 anyways, so I'm not sure what the point in continuing is. I really did try for a bit but just struggled with my courseload this semester, and I feel like while the professor could help me out a bit, this might be a bit too much to try to balance out to a passing grade. Any thoughts?",

I was never a professor haha, but I was a biology TA, and from a teacher's point of view, we are generally willing to help if a student asks for help. We don't know about the problems until a student approaches us about it, and when they do approach us, most of us will try to do whatever we can to help. Some teachers are just mean, but I suggest trying anyway because you never know what they may be able to do for you like mark the course as Incomplete until you can come back at a later time and finish it out.",

I did ask for some help earlier on for the reading and he mostly just said it gets easier overtime, and he was giving some help on the writing but I only asked once and he gave some semi vague advice, but I think if I were to have asked more specifically and just more questions he could\u2019ve helped more. I feel bad cause it was a good class and I did learn a decent chunk from it, but it was a terrible decision to decide to do this class right after transferring from perimeter and already having  a big course load",

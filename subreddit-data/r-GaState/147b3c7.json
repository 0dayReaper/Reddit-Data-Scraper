Machines, free weights, rock climbing walls, a basketball court, a pool, a track, a game room with pool, and a bunch of classes like yoga you can do free of charge (it's included in your student fees). It's one of the few things at GSU that I say is actually extremely good, just it can get busy during the fall and spring semesters.",

    "postText": "I'm taking Bio 1103 this summer online (iCollege) to satisfy a prerequisite at an out-of-state college. I had regular, non-stem bio in high school, and I'm good at memorization. I know this will probably be hard anyway, but at least the grade does not transfer to my college. \n\nDoes anyone know if it's ok to take the lab with a different professor? I don't get advising as part of the deal.\n\nIs there a common video/test bank that the professors just grade the tests from, or does each professor actually make their own video and test from it?  Would it be better to have the same prof who has bad ratings, or have a good lab prof and a bad lecture prof? \n\nThanks!",

A 10-minute walk to GSU Urban Life Building and 8-minute walk from MARTA station makes this a prime location for students to easily commute throughout the city without needing a car. Though if the student has a car, parking is free! The community also provides a secure bike room to store bicycles, a plus for students who cycle to school.\n\n\r  \nThe 2 bedrooms/ 2 bathroom apartment is shared between four students. The shared area is equipped with a sofa, coffee and dining table, bar stools, standard kitchenware, a 4K Smart TV, and an entertainment center. The bedrooms are also furnished with two sets of the following: twin beds, bed frames, desks, and office chairs. The unit will also be supplied with generic basic supplies: vacuum, mop, broom, iron, and ironing board.\n\n\r  \nStudents will also be allowed to take advantage of all the amenities that are within the community such as 24-hour gym access, resort-styled saltwater pool, conference rooms, complementary coffee, pool table, pet spa, bike storage, and Zen gardens.\n\n\r  \nRates include ultra-fast gigabit fiber internet with hardwire ethernet hookups available, 24/7 centrally monitored security with ring doorbells, and Nest smart thermostats all installed to keep the student\u2019s safety and budget in mind. Tours are available but must be scheduled in advance as a courtesy to current residents. We look forward to your tenancy with us!",

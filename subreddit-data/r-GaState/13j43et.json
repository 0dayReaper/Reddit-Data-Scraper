I had friends from class and from work and family, so I didn\u2019t need more. \n\n\nYou prioritize and do some serious time management. Sure it\u2019s stressful, but it\u2019s still important to learn to do. You can engage with some apps or other helpful ways to learn some time management skills that will help. \n\nThe biggest thing is to go in remembering you can\u2019t do it all, all of the time. You may find scheduling your months in advance in a virtual scheduling app could be helpful to help you visualize where pockets of time are.\n\nIt\u2019s hard work but it\u2019s needed so you can work, go to school, and have fun, so many folks find ways to meet their needs.",

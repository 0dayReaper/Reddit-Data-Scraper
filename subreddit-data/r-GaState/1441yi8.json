            "comment": "When I took it, the lecture was much harder than the lab.\n\nThat being said, the class is super concept based so make sure you have a good understanding of the concepts before you try visualizing any of the problems you're given. The textbook helps out in explaining what needs to happen and how to draw the diagrams for the class.\n\nThe calc in the class isn't so bad and it's next to nonexistant until the last unit in the semester with simple harmonic motion.\n\nThe labs are super easy. The biggest problem you'll have in the lab is figuring out how to use the equipment and take measurements, which isn't too bad once you get started.\n\nLastly, of you're struggling to get the topics in the class, GSU has a STEM Tutoring Center that offers Physics tutoring.",

All concept based.  It\u2019s just hard.  But if you\u2019re just worried about failing, you should be fine.  Summer has 2 labs a week and a quiz every week and test every 2.  Wouldn\u2019t Recommend unless it\u2019s your only class and you\u2019re a good student",

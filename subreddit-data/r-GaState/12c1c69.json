I wanted to know if the online section gets more work than the in person section. Also if you know if either teacher posts review content that actually pertains to the exams (or if the quizzes and homework\u2019s prepare students for the exams) please share. \n\nIf y\u2019all know if the homework and tests are uniform throughout all FI 3300 professors please let me know!",

And he has quizzes every other week I\u2019d like to say and it\u2019s unlimited attempts. Discussion every other week and they\u2019re really easy. The exams are lockdown browser but he lets you have a page of notes. He isn\u2019t a bad teacher and the homework helps with exam studying, the material is just hard. He also curves exams a lot and if you get a good score on final he\u2019ll drop an exam grade. He\u2019s a pretty good teacher",

    "postText": "I am a current student at GSU and have been putting off the math courses. I just found out that the math placement test is a thing. Can somebody explain, step by step, how the placement test works? What process would I go through to take the test in order to fulfill the Area A math requirement? I do not mind having to take the support class- I just want to take the least complicated math class possible.",

It\u2019s just like 20 questions(I forgot the exact number) from one course of math and if you get an 80 or higher you pass and can skip a course. Any lower and you fail but you can take the test I think more than once(that\u2019s what I did at least)",

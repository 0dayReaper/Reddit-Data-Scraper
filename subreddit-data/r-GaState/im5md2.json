The professors can see all messages sent via Icollege including Groupme invites. 95% of the time they will join and not say a word. They are cracking down on cheating hardcore this semester. So just don\u2019t be dumb. Even if you use something that is harder to track like Discord, they can still see that and punish the whole class with webcam exams forever. Just trying to give you guys a heads up and know that the professors have multiple degrees, so they are not dumb.",

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the professor become more strict and include a webcam, lockdown, and a time limit.

He said he will let us know for sure as it gets closer. I suspect that he\u2019s making sure we are not using the groupme as a cheat before making the final call. It just ruins it for the entire class to have to use lockdown because someone had to ask others for 1 or two questions.",

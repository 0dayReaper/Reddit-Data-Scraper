            "comment": "Matthew Grover you mean? Yeah he was really easy for me. The lectures were online, and each one would include AOTD (adaption of the day) \"presentations\" - really like 2-5 minutes of just talking, only light research is required, and you won't need a PowerPoint or anything. Just a summary of an organism's biological adaption summarized in a document. He'll pull a few names at random to present, and after presenting, they submit it online (20% of grade).\n\nBest tip for that I'd say is be prepared. It takes like 10 minutes. He will pull people at random until all names are called, and only until everyone has gone once will he restart the list. Even if there are less people due to the summer semester, you'll probably go tops three times. I went just twice during all of the fall semester. So if you miss one, your grade will be hurt. Be sure you have your citation for full credit.\n\nThe quizzes are 80% of your grade and just come from textbook reading. Usually just one multiple choice question and the other written response.\n\nLet me know if I'm thinking about the wrong professor. Hope I helped!",

Some of my artworks are currently being sold in a bookstore at Ponce City Market. I just launched my personal website [Apecyn Art ](https://www.apecynart.com). Check it out if you\u2019re interested in Atlanta themed souvenirs. I also do commission projects. Let me know if you like my art. I\u2019d love to give out discounts!",

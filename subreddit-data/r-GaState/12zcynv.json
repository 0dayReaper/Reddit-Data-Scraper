I\u2019ve had ones that just read off the slides they\u2019ve already posted so I find it a better use of my time to just study the slides outside of class. But yea, I agree with you. It depends on both the student\u2019s ability to engage with material and an instructor\u2019s teaching style.",

If not how would they know?\n\nSeriously, students who miss a lot of class tend to do very badly because they miss information from lectures and, more important, questions and discussions.\n\nThis assumes the instructor or prof is actually doing their job and not just showing canned lectures or reading from a slide deck without extra information or explanation.\n\nStill there is a very direct correlation between attendance, homework grades and test scores.",

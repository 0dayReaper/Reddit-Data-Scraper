Is there anything you like or dislike and would you recommend it to other students. \n\nI want to be fully prepared on the student life and academics that come with being a city student. \n\nI\u2019m still having trouble deciding if I want to go to georgia state or kennesaw",

            "comment": "1. Make all of your arrangements in terms of housing and transportation, and/or food before you start school (if you're out-of-state). \n\n2.Talk to an academic advisor ASAP to plan your course schedule, an advisor will be selected for you based on the level of credits taken and the year you are in. \n\n3. Consult the undergrad catalog to select courses that are part of your degree program. \n\n4. Register for PAWS, that's where everything regarding financial aid, course registration, and final grades, academic evaluations, and transcripts are going to be at. \n\n5. Get you a PantherCard made so you can access campus facilities like the Library and/or classroom buildings that are limited-access to students and faculty.\n\n6. Take the CLEP exams to cover the core curriculum classes on campus. Taking a CLEP exam is equivalent to university credit and will save you money in the long run.\n\n7. Apply for scholarships. This school has a buttload of them that are tailored to your course of study.\n\n8. There are lots of student organizations that you can join if you're want a part of the campus life. You'll make loads of friends in your interest group.\n\n9. If you have a documented disability, register with Access and Accommodations. They will give you what you ask for to make your classes less stressful, like extended time on exams and assignments. Your professors must oblige by the accommodations whenever you request them. All of your accommodations will be detailed on a letter sent to your professors. The accommodations they have are part of Section 504.\n\nGeorgia State is quite cool, it's a BIG school with a diverse population of people from all walks of life, just stay away from the ghetto types though. I surely warn you, that you'll need 10 BULLETPROOF VESTS and a micro-Uzi to navigate Downtown \ud83d\ude06 Avoid panhandlers and con artists, and other sussy people. If you see something bad go down, call the GSU Police. Safety is a core element to your success here and I pray for your success. \ud83d\ude42",

As a commuter, I have yet to even witness any crime, which I think is because reports most often come in at night or the end of the week\u2014after I\u2019d have gone home awhile ago. If you\u2019re going to live on campus, sticking to a curfew is probably one of the best things you can do for yourself, but you\u2019ll also have dormmates who could give you more credible advice than I can. If you\u2019re still worried about crime problems but still want to go to GSU, you can always just go to one of the perimeter campuses",

I highly recommend you go to different social events, join clubs, go to the job fairs, all that. Also, the food in the dining halls ranges from pretty good to fantastic which is a major plus. A lot of people are doing their own thing so don\u2019t be super bummed if it\u2019s hard to make friends. Another thing is that you need to talk to your roommates beforehand if you can, and set ground rules / chore responsibilities / cleaning days, you do not want dirty roommates and/or people you don\u2019t vibe with.",

Unless you borderline harass them, you will not receive the help that you deserve. I stayed on hold for 2 hours minimum every call when I was transferring from a different school, and be sure to ask questions. Financial aid could hide details that could save you money (accepted grants, scholarships, and work study), housing might leave you guessing on a roommate or where you are actually going to stay, and parking will not charge you on your account until a week or two before the due date\u2026leaving you to pay $400-800 in a short span of time. I have seen so many people burned by ga state aid, so please be diligent in securing yours.",

Now I don't have any college debt, so in my opinion it was worth it. But other than that, the staff I had were consistently unhelpful. Socially, it also sucks. A lot of bullshit clubs that weren't good. I'm Asian, so I went to an AASO meeting (Asian American student organization). Fucking half the people weren't even Asian, just a bunch of weird folks who \"loved Asian culture\" (a nice way to say they fetishize kpop artists and anime). Don't get me started on how awful the Graphic Design club was. Shitty campus, especially at night. I'd never recommend dorming there. Imagine paying 10-15k per academic year for a dorm you're advised to not even leave at night lol. Maybe even if you're lucky, during the day you'll have someone shit on the street in front of you or threaten you! Both happened to me :)) so three cheers for GSU security doing anything to try and help the situation with student safety. \n\nI was thankful when the campus closed in 2020 for COVID, being able to take my classes online and not deal with going down to that shit hole made it my favorite year. \n\nNow that I've graduated (with no debt), I travel the world and enjoy life MUCH more these days. Life gets incredibly better after college. I'm sure some people enjoyed their experience, but I didn't and I've got every right to tell people why. \n\nGood luck!",

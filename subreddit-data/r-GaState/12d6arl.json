Don't advertise that you have something valuable. Don't stop to talk to strangers. Learn to listen to and trust your instincts. It's the same in every US city I've been to.\n\nThat said, the shootings aren't random - these are people with beef getting into it. You see something going down, don't rubberneck - just remove yourself. Yeah, maybe don't hang out by the racetrak at 2am. Don't go to big stupid parties hosted by idiots where people are raising hell.",

People on campus are often not students and will try to ask you for money and sometimes they get upset if you have nothing. It may be tempting to be a good person and give a dollar to someone homeless but remember if you do that, a flood of them will come to you and basically take all your money. That's happened to me once and it's better to just keep walking and pretend you're busy. It's better than going broke and it's better than being threatened if you say no. \n\nNever walk alone at night. This is serious. Never do that at GSU because creeps will follow you and try to rob you for cash or worse. If you wanna go somewhere at night, you can call the campus police to escort you or get a friend to walk with you. Or just stay inside your dorm/home for the night. \n\nTry to avoid woodruff park the best you can by walking on the other side of the street. That place is known as the homeless people park and it's also where some violence happens. The whole Aderhold learning center area can be pretty rough so try to get to classes as fast as possible without stopping for anyone. \n\nIf you take the Marta, don't just put your bag on the seat next to you, keep it between your feet. One time I saw a dude trying to discreetly unzip my backpack to take my things while on the train. Learned my lesson.",

If you want to live in the city but don't want to live on campus, there are multiple apartment buildings that aren't in the heart of downtown that you can use Marta to get around. If you happen to live with your parents and have a decent enough family dynamic to not lose your entire mind living at home, you could try that option of commuting to campus via car (maybe argue its cheaper to buy you a car and parking passes than buy you a dorm room). \n\nEven if you do live on campus or directly near campus, you can generally avoid trouble by being aware and mindful of your surroundings. If you notice a large area of activity, try to assess the situation from a safe distance and decide to go some route less active and crowded. Don't get involved in business that isn't yours and nobody should give you any problems.",

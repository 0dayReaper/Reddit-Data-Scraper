    "postText": "Incoming grad student here, I just got my stipend offer for my assistantship, and it seems crazy low. I've been talking to some friends at other USG colleges in similar positions and they're all making at least 4x more, enough to actually live off of and pay their bills. I was really counting on being able to use the stipend to afford the COL in Atlanta, but it looks like that won't be remotely possible. Any other grad students have a similar experience or have any advice on how they were able to afford living expenses?",

Some departments do offer more, but it\u2019s only a few hundred dollars difference. No matter what, a grad assistantship stipend (at least at GSU) is not going to be enough.\n\nLike another commenter said, some people take out loans to be able to afford living expenses and they get roommates. I didn\u2019t want to do that because the whole purpose of the GRA position, for me, was to not have to do that. I didn\u2019t want to bury myself in anymore loan debt. \n\nAs a grad student, I came straight from undergrad and I moved back in with my parents so I didn\u2019t have to pay rent. The stipend was just like pocket change; however, my parents took care of major expenses. That\u2019s not ideal for many people. However, that\u2019s how I did it and that\u2019s how several other people I know did it as well.",

Getting a second assistantship or an off campus job seems to be the go-to, along with having roommates. Or, you can apply for full time USG positions that will cover tuition (after 6 months). That's a common route too, but probably a slower route as you'll take fewer classes. Otherwise, outside fellowships like SREB and Ford foundation have helped others I know.\n\nEdited to add consider applying for Medicaid and food stamps to lessen the burden!",

When you factor in getting your entire tuition covered (even out of state is fully covered) and the stipend, it\u2019s a pretty good gig. In my experience, they will rarely let you work more than around 20 hours/week because then they have to treat you like an actual employee and offer benefits (401k etc.)\n\nBest bet is to cut costs where you can and focus on limiting the amount you take out in loans. It\u2019s tough but doable. I think my stipend came out to about 625/month so money was tight.",

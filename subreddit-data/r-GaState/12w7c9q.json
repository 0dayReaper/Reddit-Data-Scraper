It\u2019s not the closest to campus but the blue route shuttle stops right next door and they only charge $30 a month for resident parking. To what I saw rent is in the low 900s so it\u2019s better than a lot of places. I\u2019m just trying to work as much as possible right now and save up so I\u2019ll be set for at least a couple of months once move in comes.",

And the stadium was purchased with a completely different pot of funding than those that would fund any student related programs. It was also cheaper in the long run to purchase a stadium than rent out the Benz for the five people who attend football games. The former turner field area has actually been a godsend for the Summerhill area. You\u2019re getting more housing, a convocation center, free parking, and a ton of restaurants nearby.",

But there\u2019s over 50,000 students, sooner rather than later someone will test positive. Like I said, I really think we\u2019ll be at home from spring break onwards. \n\nWith regards to your own health and those around you; if you\u2019re healthy and not a child and tinker than 45, take the usual precautions. Wash your hands, don\u2019t touch your face. Also, I suggest not eating out. Try not to be in super crowded places. \n\nIf you\u2019re immune compromised or around someone who is, then I totally understand your concern. My niece is recovering from leukaemia, so I\u2019ve been very blunt with my sister that she needs to keep her home right now. It\u2019s a difficult decision to make, but there are three days left until spring break. If you feel it best to stay home, then it might be time to do so. Talk to the professor and tell them the unique situation that you\u2019re facing. \n\nSource; I\u2019m finishing a PhD in biology.",

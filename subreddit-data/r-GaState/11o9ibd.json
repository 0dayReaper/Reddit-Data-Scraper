    "postText": "I\u2019m a HS senior and I suppose I have to make a decision on where I want to go to college at some point. \n\nI toured the honors college at GSU and loved it, it seems like the school takes such a genuine interest in its students and it seems like there are so many opportunities in Atlanta. I\u2019ve been debating GSU over UGA and the biggest hangup that I have is housing. \n\nIf I commit as a rising freshman (this late in the housing registration game) is there any chance I\u2019d be able to live in school housing, especially the Honors LLC? Where should I look, if not (also, are there any housing options that scholarship money goes towards)\n\nThanks for y\u2019all\u2019s help",

I work in the office so just call Monday-Friday 8-5 and we can give you to talk to a supervisor! Also housing goes on to your tuition bill so whatever finical aid or scholarships you have can cover it",

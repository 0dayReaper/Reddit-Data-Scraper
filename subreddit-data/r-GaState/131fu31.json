I don't think GSU itself gives you a cord except for the one you receive for having a 3.5+ GPA (you should have received that when you picked up your cap and gown). Everything else has to be from whatever organization or program you're part of. For example I'm in the honors college, a gsu humanities research program, and I received a scholarship from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, so I had to RSVP for 3 separate events where they'll be giving me a cord. Maybe check and see if you ever received an email from your organizations that mentioned anything about a cord ceremony or event?",

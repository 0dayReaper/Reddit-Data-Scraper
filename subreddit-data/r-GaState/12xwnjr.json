The site allows you to input your info and it automatically matches you with scholarships. It doesn\u2019t tell you which ones. This person is asking whether anyone has heard anything, from any scholarships, for which they applied through that website. I think that\u2019s what this person is asking.",

Also, I am hoping that the OP gets a response because I would like to think the school would begin announcing the scholarships soonish.",

Literally unfair grading, rude TA, and if you don\u2019t write things exactly as they expect you to they take points off. And they don\u2019t tell you why it\u2019s wrong. Oh and one more thing, the grades for lab don\u2019t get uploaded until the end of the semester. That\u2019s what shitshiw they are.",

But good lord, when he gives hand written homework and does not grade any of it so you do not know if you are doing it right. Personally, I do know if I will pass this class due to my test grades but I wouldnt recommend him..",

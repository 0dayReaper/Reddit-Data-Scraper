Or do I just not know how to use it? there\u2019s not option to select it when I get a package from Amazon and I have to go to the leasing office to get my package. But I have seen people use the locker from time to time, so I\u2019m just confused",

Then when you go ahead and order anything and ship it here, a code should pop up to be able to receive your package from the lockers, if you would need help I could call the customer service line that\u2019s on top of the touch screen",

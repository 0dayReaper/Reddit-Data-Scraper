    "postText": "Do you go to Georgia state and you cant seem to make any friends?\n\nAre you too shy to approach people?\n\nDo you commute and miss out on the \"college experience\" just because you dont live on campus?\n\nAre the special interest clubs to much or dont interest you?\n\nDue to the plethora or responses on my last post another user and I have planned a meetup for people who just want to make friends that will talk to you after you leave campus or finish a class. College can be stressful and lonley, especially if you left all your friends behind just to come here.\n\nWhen: Friday, January 17th at 3pm\nWhere: Kung Fu Tea\n2 Park Pl NE South\nAtlanta, GA 30303\nI'll have a small sign that says \"Here from Reddit?\"\n\nIf we gauge enough interest we could definitely have another meet up! If you are coming feel free to say so in the comments! More people show up when they know other people are going. Feel free to pm me with questions!",

            "comment": "I took him for 2108 this semester, and he was pretty good. I feel like the structure of the course is similar across the board. Hw is done on achieved (15 or so assignments total with 5-7 dropped? I forgot already lol). There were a total of 7 quizzes with one dropped (they were every 2 weeks and are done online) they were also on lecture days which meant no class that day. Since youre taking it during summer then the quizzes are going to be much more frequent. There are discussions and I think one is dropped from there too. You're gonna want to read the chapters of the textbook for all content (it's an ebook provided to you on achieved). He uses class time to have what he calls \"discussions\" on the chapter content, it is expected that you have read the chapters beforehand. Just showing up to lecture will not be enough to supplement your knowledge of the material, but he also adds supplement videos and stuff on icollege to aid in your readings. That's pretty much it, with the cumulative final exam at the end of the semester (was 84 questions for me). Just make sure you do your part to read the material and make notes from it and be prepared to ask any questions if needed during lecture. He's good at explaining the topics well and is very helpful too. I was able to get an A",

And were his quizzes in person or online(if online how long did you have to take them) and all multiple choice or some written responses?  And during the discussions does he talk or is it like a class discussion time? Also is the final required? Any extra credit given in the course? Sorry for all the questions I am just nervous since his rmp rating is low and thanks for the help I genuinely appreciate it.",

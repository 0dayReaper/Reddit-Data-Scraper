He makes these scenes where he asks the entire class something and acts disappointed when nobody answers. \nAttendance is required but it\u2019s a small percentage, like 10%. It is one of the top 3 most important clases in CS so you really want to learn and attend class. \nThe grading was like 3 assignments, 3 tests, attendance, a final and a lab. I forgot the percentages but I think I still have some of those PDFs.",

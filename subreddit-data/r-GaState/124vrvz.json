    "postText": "Saw this class being taught by Durham last time and they don\u2019t have good ratings. So I\u2019m a little bit scared to take the class lol. \n\nIt\u2019s being offered again in the fall semester but doesn\u2019t have a professor yet. \n\nI decided to register for computer graphics though. I\u2019m also taking PLC and Algorithms too so that adds up to 12 credits. \n\nDo you guys think I should register for mobile app dev too? Or would it be too much?",

We use Android Studio and Xcode for Android and iOS app development, respectively. My advice is to learn the IDEs early on for faster programming. The professor is straightforward and offers great feedback, but can be disorganized with last-minute assignments. Overall, I recommend the course if you're dedicated and have the time. DM me if you have any questions when it comes to programming IDE, and I'll give you the syllabus as well.",

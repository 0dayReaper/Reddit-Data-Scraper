    "postText": "Hey everyone! I will be a senior next year at GSU and noticed that there was never an actual League of Legends club for those who enjoy playing the game. My boyfriend has an official League of Legends club at his college, so I thought it would be a great idea to start one up here for those who just want to meet others and have fun chill games. If you are interested, please let me know! I have been trying to find people who are interested to help me start up the club together. I have many ideas for the club and would love to have a place to see others make friends!\n\nEdit: Please PM me if you would like to add me on discord or league. Also, tell anyone who you know that plays league at gsu. I also made a discord server so let me know if you would like the link for that.\n\nEdit 2: Here is the discord link for those interested! https://discord.gg/vZ6dGaEWzt",

Because of y'alls kindness, I was able to get on the train and go to Phipps Plaza and Lenox Mall. I'm so happy that I went and I just wanted to thank any of you guys who commented (if anyone will ever see this). Now I can explore more parts of Atlanta and have the college experience I've always wanted. \n\n:)",

            "comment": "The ACCUPLACER placement test just exempts you from taking a prerequisite course but it does not give you credit for that prerequisite course. \n\nFor example: \nMATH 1111 (College Algebra) with a C or higher is a prerequisite for MATH 1113 (Precalculus). If you score 278 \u2013 300 in Quantitative Reasoning, Algebra and Statistics and 250-269 in Advanced Algebra and Functions in ACCUPLACER placement test, you can skip College Algebra and place directly into MATH 1113. But it does not give you credit for MATH 1111 (College Algebra).\n\nSo if you place into a course by being exempt from taking a prerequisite course but that prerequisite is a required course for you to graduate, then you have to get credit for that course by either taking that prerequisite course later or by taking the CLEP test.\n\nFor example: If you are placed directly into MATH 2211 (Calculus I) but your program of study requires you to take MATH 1113 (Precalculus) which is a prerequisite for MATH 2211, then you have to take MATH 1113 later or take the CLEP test to receive credit for MATH 1113.\n\nGeorgia State University awards credit for the following CLEP subject exams on mathematics:\n\nCalculus = Math 2211\nCollege Algebra = Math 1111\nPrecalculus = Math 1113\nCollege Mathematics = Math 1001\n\nNote: Georgia State University awards credit for only select College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) subject exams, but does not award credit for the General Exam. Tests should not be scheduled during the last semester before graduation because the limited time remaining may not be sufficient to allow for course validation and the awarding of credit. For credit to be granted, the examination score must be at least 50 or higher regardless of the ACE recommendation.\n\nSource:\n\n1. https://testing.gsu.edu/applicant-student-exams/#accuplacer\n\n2. https://mathstat.gsu.edu/undergraduate-courses/\n\n3. https://advisement.gsu.edu/atlanta/credits/college-level-examination-program-clep/",

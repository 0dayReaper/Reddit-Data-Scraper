The perimeter campuses are a great way to save money, but if you\u2019re looking for more of a college experience, I would recommend attending another institution since the perimeter campuses do not have dorms or much campus life.",

            "comment": "So, there are 5 perimeter campuses. Dunwoody and Clarkston have the largest # of students, followed by Decatur, Alpharetta, and Newton. \n\nPerimeter is a less expensive place to get your first two years in - all the credits transfer because it's part of Georgia State, and most should transfer to other USG schools too if you were looking to do that. \n\nI find that the Perimeter campuses feel more like a college campus than the Atlanta campus does all the time - at least in the traditional sense. What they don't have are dorms - but then, Atlanta doesn't have a lot of dorms either and most students commute.",

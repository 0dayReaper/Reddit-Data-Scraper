    "postText": "This is a question directed towards the students of GSU that were accepted/denied into the Atlanta Campus for their 4-year bachelor's program. As a rising senior, my stats are 3.4 (unweighted) and 3.8 (weighted) with an SAT score of 1070 and 1090 (super score). My friend told me that getting into their Atlanta Campus isn't easy and that I would need at least a 1400 SAT score. Also, I can bring my GPA up to 4.0+ (weighted) if I apply regular action. Please help,",

GSU is pretty lenient with accepting students, I\u2019ve honestly never heard of someone being rejected unless they were setting out to do so.\n\nWith your scores and GPA I\u2019m 99% sure you\u2019ll be accepted and would be considered for their honors program (if you\u2019re into that type of thing).\n\nPretty sure your friend might\u2019ve been confusing it with UGA, idk lol",

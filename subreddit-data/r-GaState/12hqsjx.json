    "postText": " Yay, mates! I have received a campus atlanta scholarship, waiving my out of state fee difference, here at Ga State and am considering to attend. My questions are primarily around academics:\n\n1.) How strong CS department is here? Well, strong is subjective word; so what here I am looking for:  \n\n\n*(i) are professors good and friendly for freshman students?.*\n\n*(ii) How's the rigor of the curriculum? Do you CS boys and girls get time to touch grass or something equally fun or do you people just end up spending lot of time on schoolwork here? I find easy and concise curriculum scoring higher in my 'strong' scale!*\n\n  \n*(iii) How's the grading of a class happen? Okay this one is tricky because I don't know how to frame this question. I was talking to a current student at top LAC (didn't get enough aid from there) and she told me that if there's grading has to happen from 100% in a class, only 20% depends upon exams and rest are from homework and assignments. Is that also case with MS State? If so, it will be fun to attend.*\n\n*(iv) Does professors for core CS oriented classes often get replaced?* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.) What are the research prospects? I have heard that Ga State has good emphasis on CS research especially around data science. Do undergraduate students get chance on research projects or are they reserved for grad and phd people?\n\n3.) Library! I think that this will be the most important place in my life for next 4 years for study. Is this as beautiful as shown in youtube videos? What are the operating hours of library ? (I am a night owl and would love to study there in night if possible).\n\n4.) Are student competitive? I feel that students at Ga State are very friendly and that's grand. But is there also a healthy competitive environment among students. Competition always stimulates to do always better.\n\n5.) Prospects of co-op opportunities and internship from sophomore year onwards? I would love to get hands-on experience and money. Does university provide opportunities and support to get internship or does one have to do his own hardwork to get that?\n\n6.) I also got into honors college. Is it any good except providing priority registration for classes? Do anyone of you get to experience their 'london experience'? How was that?  \n\n\nThank you again for reading all my questions. I will be extremely grateful for your honest response as they have the ability to form nexr four years of my life?",

I have few more questions.\n\n&gt;The curriculum is outdated, taught poorly, and will do nothing to prepare you for the workforce. You will need to be doing the work on your own to learn these concepts with outside materials and practice. If competent and willing to put in the work, most content is very easy but expect no help from TAs or professors.\n\nSeems like a hassle. Is university management doing nothing to counter this?\n\n&gt;Regardless, you will do fine if you put in the effort to learn the concepts covered in the lectures on your own.\n\nWhat alternatives will you suggest to prepare for classes in advanced then?\n\n&gt;School aside, Atlanta is going to have vastly more opportunity and connections for an international student than literally anywhere in missisippi will, along with vastly more internship opportunity. IMO, that internship experience is by far the most important for bettering yourself.\n\nAtlanta is more or less the reason I am leaning towards Ga State. \n\n&gt;more importantly make connections to get one without major struggles.\n\nConnections to whom exactly? How exactly can one do that?",

But yes, saving money is important. \n\nAs for UF, I wouldn't go to Florida for anything right now. I have a lot of friends / colleagues literally moving out of the state because the situation is so bad. You'd probably get some debate about comparing it to GT academically, as well.\n\nSaving money is important, and GSU is an R1. I only mentioned transferring to GT because a lot of students seem to have that on their radar as a plan, especially international students doing engineering or CS, but a great strategy can also be to bounce over there for an MS after your BS.",

There have been a lot of scary higher ed policies passed by the state that allow government interference in universities; for example, the governor gutted New College and  put extremists on the board. Tenure is at risk; the state will have trouble bringing in research faculty, talent, grants, etc. moving forward. For K-12 education, the book banning, prohibiting teaching history, etc., and censorship and vilification of educators has led to a terrible educational environment. I had friends who are fleeing tell me their kids' elementary school teachers removed all supplemental books from their classroom, for fear of being reported / facing charges. Most people I know agree it is fascism &amp; it's one of the main topics in our domestic news cycle right now.  Georgia has some similar issues but they aren't nearly as bad.",

            "comment": "1). Basically what /u/scrimpi_shrimpi said. Thankfully, a lot of undergrad level CS can be learned through sites like Youtube, Freecodecamp, Leetcode, Udemy, etc. The easiness of your class is heavily dependent on your professor, some are crazy and bad, some are just lazy. However, I do recommend taking honors level programming classes if you can, they seem to be the only classes that challenge you and make you learn foundations properly (at least with my professor, goes by Professor Raj). These honors level cs classes differ in that their labs are separate from the normal class labs, otherwise it's about the same. \n\n2.) Idk but I have heard of assistantship programs for Honors students. If you're in Honors, you'll be receiving a weekly Honors-only email subscription which talks about new things happening in the Honors departments or new opportunities for Honors students. Really helpful if you're looking for additional scholarships, internships, or research opportunities. \n\n3.) The library is pretty nice and decent. If I recall, the library is open up to 2AM. The library also has special rooms and equipment related to video and audio recording, digital media software, and disability equipment. You can also rent out some equipment; I rented out a camera ring light to make me look better for an online interview. There's also the law school library, which is nicer and even has a cafe. Only thing I don't like about the law library is that it tends to feel lonelier because it's a 7-13 minute walk from the main part of our campus.\n\n4.) It is a state university, so most are just here to get their degree and get out. We're also a commuter-heavy school, meaning that most people drive from home to get to campus, and go back home after their day is done. Because of these factors our uni is pretty chill and you'll get some free time for at least the first two years. I manage a decently big club here and 70% of the weeks I have a livable amount of free time. That is to say, there absolutely are competitive students, some good some bad. Most people here are friendly and many are just trying to make a better living for themselves one day. I'd say if you're an international student from India, you'll be prepared for any competition at GSU.\n\n5.) We have multiple career fairs throughout each year, some of which are major-exclusive (business majors have their own career fairs sometimes, for example). Very few businesses offer co-ops but most will offer internships, with the most competitive ones being in SWE. I managed to get a nice internship with a well-known company around these parts of the country thanks to our general career fair, and some university club experience. We have a student career center which will help you get your resumes right, help you find internships, rent you out clothes for an interview, and even get you a free professional-looking headshot for your online profile. It's going to be tough to get an internship opportunity as an international student, but it is still 100% possible even in the USA's current job market. Atlanta is only growing and has toons of opportunity. I recommend looking for summer internships as soon as you start your sophomore fall semester. Expect to be applying to a loooot of applications online. Take advantage of the career fair whenever you can and polish up your resume through the career center. \n\n6.) Honors is also really good for their $0.01/page printing, good widescreen computer lab, free semester-long laptop rental, access to more scholarships and Honors-department assistance to attain those scholarships, 3-4 credit Honors seminars that may interest you, free flavored water fountain, and it looks better on your resume when applying to internships. Some companies also come here directly and look for Honors students. The CIA was here last week and they were doing a Q&amp;A and some simulation exercises with students who signed up for the event. I know the CIA isn't a company but I forgot which exact ones came earlier in this semester.\n\nIf you have any more questions then lmk im down to answer",

Yeah, I read about Honors research and scholarship. Can you explain more about their London experience? Is it very competitive to get?\n3. Library is a beauty. \n4. Environment sounds great. While I am aware that small minority of assholes exist everywhere, I think that it's good that majority people are collaborative.\n5. What's SWE? Also, what kinda of club do you lead?

                            "comment": "1. The Honors are considered as a substitute and clears the same requirements as a normal class does. From what I've heard, the non-CS honors classes aren't that different but they usually entail an extra project, essay, or assignment. Some may not the additional workload, since most are only in Honors for the benefit of early class registration. I only took one Honors class so I'm no position to say they're great, but the one I took did help me a lot.\n\n2. I don't know much about the London Experience tbh, but its page on the GSU site seems to be geared towards law, business, and film students. They say its open for all majors however so you may want to check with the Honors department when you get here if you want to learn more.\n\n5. SWE stands for software engineering, and if you haven't heard of it yet its basically one of the most in-demand CS jobs that pays a lot right out of college. I'm in the cybersecurity club, here's the discord if you want to join: https://discord.gg/sKMpJbxB. \n\n6. My Honors CSC1301 class (the very first CS class) had a great lab professor, but I will admit it got really tough towards the end of the semester since the lab professor was teaching material wayyy ahead of the main course professor, which was nice, but I had trouble teaching myself how to \"think\" the right way to finish the assigned projects since I was being overloaded with all this new knowledge I'm still learning how it works. That being said, having early-access to class registration + the benefits I listed on my previous comment really helps ease the harder parts of the semester.",

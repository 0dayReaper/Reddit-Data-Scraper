    "postText": "Hi guys! I usually don't post like this, but I'm kind of desperate at this point. I have already been accepted to GSU with the honors college, but I'm still deciding between colleges and one of the deciding factors is hobbies. I recently picked up figure skating, and I really love it and definitely want to continue it in college, but it seems like there isn't a regular rink near campus. To be honest, I really have no idea if there is a rink nearby or not, and my search online isn't really going anywhere. Does anyone know of a club or something at GSU where I can continue figure skating? Thanks so much! :)",

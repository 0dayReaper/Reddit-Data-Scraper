            "comment": "If you can, avoid buying Pearson books online. Unless its absolutely unavoidable. Their customer service sucks ass. I've spent over 500$ for a fucking lab manual because their platform is built around NOT letting you own your books so you can't turn around and give your friends/colleagues free/discounted  copies because, you know, we have so much money to spend on course materials.\n\nFor context: I tried to be proactive and bought the book before the semester so I could get a head start on the material. I bought the mastering and lab book without the course code believing I would just input the course code once classes began. The annoying thing is that Pearson doesn't give you a PDF version of your book, its some epub bs you can only access on their site. If you want to print the pages out, you get a huge \"NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION\" watermark on some of the pages.\n\n Fast forward to the first day of classes, i get the course code (since its all online) and my lab book magically disappears. I emailed CS and they couldn't merge the lab book into my course, so I just have to wait for a refund (thankfully) but then spend $490 on a bundle from the college bookstore because i, like most other students, need the same book and the college has run out. Of course the only books left are the bundled packages so now, I'm out $610 until I get my refund for the lab  ebook. \n\nOh and for those who wondered why I didn't just order the book, there's a 2 week wait on the campus resupply, and USPS still hasn't delivered my package I ordered last month. Im not the only student with this issue, some of my colleagues have also been waiting for their textbooks to be delivered via mail carrier and I didn't want to get behind in class waiting for a fucking book.",

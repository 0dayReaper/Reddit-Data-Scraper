    "postText": "Y\u2019all I just got chased from lofts to the library like full on running by the houseless guy that hangs around campus who always has a bunch of blankets around his waist. It was one of the scariest moments of my life. I even went into student center for 10 minutes and he was hiding outside waiting for me so I ran to the library and he almost got me while I opened the door with my card. Like y\u2019all. This is not a joke I know how easy it is to get comfortable walking around outside at night, but please be careful and bring pepper spray, don\u2019t be stupid like me. Campus police is apprehending him as far as I know since I got security at the library, but you never know what could happen. Be safe and be smart. Don\u2019t get too comfortable and be me.\n\nUpdate: the campus police didn\u2019t do shit. When I called a police escort to take me home an hour later the man was right outside the library and had chased another girl who was also hiding and waiting for a police escort. I told the officer who was going to escort me home and felt like he didn\u2019t really care. He was literally running around trying to force the doors of the library and student center west open and screaming. what the fuck.",

They call it Hurt Park for a reason. \n\nFuck the pepper spray get a taser or a strap.\n\nI know I\u2019m terrible. Also, I thought GSU ran shuttles from the dorms to the student center.

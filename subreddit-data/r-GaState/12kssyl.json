    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming freshman majoring in CIS, living in Alpharetta, and commuting to school. I don't know what class structure I should try to sign up for. I would love to get some recommendations on scheduling my classes and what days I should have them to be comfortable commuting. Thanks in advance, everyone!",

            "comment": "I'm also a commuter, but neuroscience. I assume the structure can probably be the same, though. Caveat, I'm a part time student, I generally do 3-4 classes per semester.\n\nI would recommend opening some kind of list editor which can do check box items (Google Keep, for example), and putting each class you need on its own line with any prerequisites in parenthesis. For example, for calc 1 (Math 2201) which requires precal (Math 1113) as a prereq:\n\n* MATH 2201 (MATH 1113)\n\nOnce you have all the classes for your degree on the list, then open a spreadsheet plan out your semesters/timeline. This way you can \"check off\" classes from your list as you plan them. You'll also know if it requires any pre-reqs, and can look to see if you've already planned those or not.\n\nI've always been able to keep my classes either:\n\n- Monday/Wednesday\n- Monday/Wednesday/Friday\n- Tuesday/Thursday\n- Asynchronous online\n\nYou can search [gosolar](https://www.gosolar.gsu.edu/bprod/bwckschd.p_disp_dyn_sched) and see what works best for you.\n\nFor the lower/mid level stuff, I've generally had no trouble finding what I need on any particular day combination I needed it, and was able to stick to my original plan I laid out.\n\nFor the higher level major classes (So for me, that was the 4000 level neuroscience courses) it became more difficult to plan ahead of time what I wanted to do and when, because those generally aren't posted until partway through the semester before. So you'll likely have to make some adjustments based off that.\n\nAlso, LPT, you can do up to 4 summer classes at Perimeter Campus, if you want/need to. You just have to get an advisor to help you register for it (any advisor can help you with this). In my experience, PC is a bit cheaper, easier, and has more online options.",

You can get an unlimited use MARTA card through the university, I think it's like, $80/mo? My employer also offers one for $55/mo, if you work perhaps your employer offers something similar.",

I'm a bit ahead with science and math credits from APs, but as you said, shouldn't make a large difference. I'm definitely leaning toward the Tuesday/Thursday stack. I also plan on transferring to GT after my first year so it should all work out well. Thanks again!",

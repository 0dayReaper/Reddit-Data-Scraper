Anyone taken either of them and can shed some light?",

It\u2019s challenging for those who hate Biology, but if you love it you should be fine. The lab portion of the course is also pure memorization and knowing different biochemical tests, gram stains, and being able to identify an unknown microbe given to you in the lab using all those tests.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! I graduated this past December and I\u2019m selling my cap, gown, and the royal blue stole for $75. The graduation regalia is normally $112 with tax, which is what I paid for it. The only thing that\u2019s not included is the tassel, which wouldn\u2019t work for this year anyway since I graduated in 2022. You should be able to buy a tassel for $10 through Herf Jones, though. DM me if you\u2019re interested! I live in Marietta but I\u2019m willing to meet in the middle depending on where you are.",

    "postText": "Hi, does anyone know how the \"AP Computer Science Principles\" credit appears on a GSU transcript? CollegeBoard states that GSU will count it as 3 credits (\"CSC 1099\" ?) --- but I am not sure how that is displayed on a transcript, as CSC 1099 is not an official course that GSU offers. \n\nIf someone happens to have a screenshot, or even just some insight here, that would be much appreciated. Thank you.",

Btw, I'm guessing you have the credit, how is the course listed/worded on your actual transcript? \n\nI'm curious bc the college I want to transfer to requires it to be listed on transcript in a specific way for it to transfer over...",

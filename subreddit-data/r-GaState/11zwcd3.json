From what I can tell, those are going to be super easy (assuming you're coming in with good Programming / Math experience).\n\nJust a heads up, you'll want to adjust that Spring 2024 schedule; GSU has an 18 credit limit per semester. I believe there is a way to write in a special request to go over 18 credits, but no promises since I never did that.",

I do have a decent amount of prior knowledge (intermediate C++, Python, JS, UNIX) but nothing so theoretical or rigorous in the way that classroom learning may entail.\nAre there any CS classes that might come with more difficulty than they're worth?",

Though, they're only worth taking if they'll somehow benefit your transfer. \n\nIs it certain Tech will include those \"wasted credits\" towards meeting transfer minimums, considering they won't count once admitted? You might know better than me tbh, I'd just recommend analyze the Tech transfer equivalencies/policies, then pick some that'll transfer instead. I'm planning to transfer to UGA, and I know they have a similar policy. I've avoided wasting credits that don't transfer because they also won't count towards transfer minimums either. \n\nBtw, if you end up trying to find other kind of general/elective classes to take instead and have any questions about what they were like etc, feel free to hit me up, I've taken many courses at GSU now and I know what some others are like.",

Also, even if the classes that don't receive transfer credit didn't count toward that requirement, I'd still have 36 credit hours.\n\nI expect to have \\~15 credit hours of free electives by the time I get into Tech so I hope I won't have to... but we'll see if I have to take you up on that offer.",

That's not enough credit hours (13 short) to meet the requirements for transferring. I know I'm already \"wasting\" 7 credit hours by taking CS 2720 &amp; 3210, so I'm not trying to \"waste\" 6 more by taking unrelated unnecessary classes.\n\nI also have enough free elective credits from highschool AP scores and dual enrollment that taking classes for electives wouldn't really matter.\n\nI'm sure about the classes but I'm not sure about the organization. Should I take all 3 of my math classes in the fall semester, just to balance out my credit hours a little?",

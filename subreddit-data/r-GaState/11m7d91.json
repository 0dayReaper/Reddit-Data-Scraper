I believe the average citizen supports it, because there is a concern that there are not enough officers on the force and this is leading to longer response times, and more vehicle break-ins. I have experienced both of those issues personally and it affects how I vote in elections now.\n\nAlso, using violence or intimidation to achieve a political goal is the definition of terrorism. When you are using the threat of violence against construction workers to stop progress on the project it is an example of this. Is it a great example? Nope, but it does meet the definition. I suspect a plea deal will be forthcoming but those charges will not just be dropped.\n\nThe shooting of the police officer, and subsequent refusal by the activist community to accept one of their own did something bad, was when i went from being passive to actively supporting the training center. They have on record the man purchasing the gun which shoots the type of bullet that was found in the officers body. Sometimes when it quacks like a duck, it\u2019s a duck. \n\nAlso, they\u2019re not clear cutting the thing, they are putting a training facility on a small part of the land. It will still be a nice place once jt is built. They are also committed to replacing trees. \n\nAs far as the prison farm goes, I agree it would be nice if they did some conservation work to preserve its legacy, but let\u2019s not pretend it\u2019s not just an abandoned area in the woods right now. Also, building on the side of the prison farm is a way to avoid some of the environmental impacts. To put it simply, by using land that was already destroyed to build the prison farm all those years ago, they are preserving other parts of the forest that they would have had to be built on instead.",

If they want to fix it, they can fix it with community outreach and give a better picture of themselves instead of being involved in controvery every year in police brutality and murder. How does a CQB facility do any of that? How does it make up for the 500 man short fall of officers this city has? All it does is give the 1500ish officers on the force more tools to indiscriminately harm us. \n\nAlso, by your definition, APD running around the city in APCs and having the army buzz the city for hours in blackhawks is terrorism is it not since its intimation on a much larger factor then throwing rocks or using fire works, and thats assuming that these Units don't activately harm anyone during these shows of force. \n\nNext, the gun they had was chambered in 9mm, that is like the most common handgun round in the country (and APD use), and APD has a long history of planting fake evidence on people \n\nAlso, I don't know if you understand Old Growth Trees aren't regular trees. They help reduce climate change more, and the US has cut like 95% of all old growth trees in the country. Their preservation is really important, which is why environmental groups who have no political stance are against this. Also its not like we citizens of are just gonna be allowed to walk around Weelanue forest anymorr after they build this urban combat center.",

However, being a big city cop is more exciting. So yes, this does fill a training need, especially for the fire department, but for people that are law enforcement inclined it is supposed to be exciting. Basically it\u2019s kind of how college football is, they build obscenely nice facilities in order to get more recruits. \n\nThe government def wants to show it is in control of the situation, if they did this all the time just to remind us who\u2019s in charge, I would have a big problem with it. Since they\u2019re only bringing it out for serious security situations, not even the super-bowl as you said, I think it\u2019s fine as long as they don\u2019t stick around.\n\nAlso, unless you\u2019re suggesting the feds are in on it, the evidence that the gun was purchased by him is ironclad and rocksolid. That\u2019s a background check done by the FBI. I wish the GB I had body cameras, and I bet they will get them after this, but I personally think that the evidence that we do have is solid enough. \n\nSo on the website they say this\n\nThe City intends to preserve the remaining more than 300 acres of property\u2014which includes portions of Intrenchment Creek and the South River Forest Basin\u2014as restored and improved green space for ecological protection and the public\u2019s enjoyment as part of the larger South River Forest initiative.  \n\nTo me, losing a few old growth trees are worth it. You can never totally minimize the environmental impacts, but I think they\u2019ve done enough to show that they took the environmental impacts of the project seriously. The words \u201cpublic enjoyment\u201d are doing a lot of heavy lifting, but they are at least saying for now that they will be some sort of public element to it. We will see if that makes it all the way through though.",

Atlanta is at 3/4 the recommended strength level presently. But that doesn't answer the question of how does spending 90,000,000 dollars on a military style urban warfare school fix that? \n\nIn the past little kids wanted to be cops to protect their community, but what kid rn living in places like South Fulton or Clayton County sees everyone in their community fear the police, see the biggest protest of police brutality of their lives in 2020 be crushed by more brutality. Or the city respond to protests of the urban warfare school with them driving APCs thru downtown and say \"Yeah I wanna be cop\"?",

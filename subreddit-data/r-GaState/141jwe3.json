Two of the courses i'm taking are mostly made up of discussion posts and I don't have anything else going on during the summer except for these classes so I think I should be alright (hopefully).\n\nThe only real advice I can give for this is to make a schedule.  I personally used the notes app to organize and list every assignment that was due at the end of the week, created a daily schedule to spread it out across a few days and then tick them off every time I finished with one.  It helped me keep up with my 5 classes last semester.  Good luck to you as well!",

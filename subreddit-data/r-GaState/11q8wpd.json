    "postText": "I got an A in AP1. It was my favorite class and I spent hours studying for it. My quizlets have gotten other people A\u2019s on their lab assessments and although they studied more than just my quizlets, I figure I could help out other students. I\u2019m also an early action admit to the nursing program if that solidifies the legitimacy of the quizlets.\nThey have been described by classmates as, \u201cGOATED,\u201d \u201cclutch,\u201d \u201ccrazy\u201d\nLab assessment quizlets include pictures and correctly spelled terms along with information that you NEED TO KNOW for the assessment.\nI also have lecture quizlets but I put a lot of work into those so I\u2019d probably wanna sell for $10. \nIf anyone is interested please let me know.\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

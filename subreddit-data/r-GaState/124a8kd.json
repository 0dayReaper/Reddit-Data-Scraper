If you have less than 30 transfer hours (freshman), and are not a non-traditional freshman (5 years since highschool graduation), then you can attend the 2 year Perimeter campus with a GED. 4 year Atlanta campus needs a high school transcript unless you\u2019re a non-traditional freshman. Perimeter campus is cheaper and you can transition to the Atlanta campus later.",

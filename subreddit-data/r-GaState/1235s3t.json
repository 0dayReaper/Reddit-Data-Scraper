Do you just accept that you\u2019ve wasted all this time and money? Do you get to try again? I\u2019m really nervous.",

If you don't succeed in those two attempts, you have to change your major or something. \nThere's also a groupme chat for pre-nursing students that's really helpful.\nIf you have other questions, I can try to answer them as well.",

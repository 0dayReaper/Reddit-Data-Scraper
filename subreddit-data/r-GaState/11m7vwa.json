    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a student finishing my undergrad in Anthropology and Sociology at Agnes Scott College. I am currently conducting a directed research project about how daters construct their profiles on dating apps. I am focusing specifically on Generation Z (people between the ages of 18 and 25) and the Hinge app. If you are between the ages of 18 and 25, use Hinge, and are single it would be amazing if you could take the survey linked below. It should take less than 15 minutes and is completely anonymous. Furthermore, if you volunteer to be interviewed you will be entered into a raffle to win a gift card! Feel free to message me with any questions!\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Survey](https://forms.gle/fU28wNa5LbW93GoU9)",

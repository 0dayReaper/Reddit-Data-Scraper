I am not sure if it matters who my instructor is but I have Victoria Mariani, and have been told it is a free online textbook. I want to review over the summer because it has been quite a while since I took Chem I. Thanks!",

They will probably force you to pay for Pearson, but I see plenty of people in my class use this book instead anyways and it has the same information. \nhttps://openstax.org/books/chemistry-2e/pages/10-introduction",

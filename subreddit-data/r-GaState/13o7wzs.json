    "postText": "hi lmao this might be a dumbass question but my og summer balance was like over $512 but then changed to this negative balance after financial aid (since technically the og price was like over 2k and the aid was over 3k). I thought this would like, be refunded after awhile but it's still this balance and not at $0.00 yet. Am I supposed to be doing something cause it's been a couple weeks?? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbxi05edc91b1.png?width=335&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cb89963391d82e50281ec4f24888bfef8284b0c2",

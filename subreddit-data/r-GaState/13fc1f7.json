    "postText": "Hey yall, I am a rising freshmen planning on taking summer classes. (Currently a high school senior about to graduate) I had couple of questions. \n\n1. If I did Fafsa last year, will I get financial aid summer 2023 even though I was first planning on starting fall 2023?\n\n2. Do I have to attend orientation and will it be available before summer classes?\n\n3. If I am taking math classes and need to take placement exam, can I still take those?\n\nI am planning on taking summer classes that start on June 5th. Any info would be helpful, thanks!",

            "comment": "1) I'm not sure; it's probably best to call the financial aid office quickly before the start of your summer classes\n2) yes, definitely still attend orientation; there should be a GSU-mandated page highlighting the specific days and times they have orientation available, so you are able to choose an orientation time that best fits your schedule; I would suggest signing up for orientation as quickly as possible at an early date, as typically (not always) the 'good classes' tend to be taken by those individuals who went to orientation early in comparison to those who went to orientation last monute\n3) yes, definitely take the math placement exam! This will help save you money and time in terms of college credit hours :))",

Check the Start @ State page for details and to sign up.\n3. You can do your placement exam, but I doubt you'll be able to get that and the orientation done in time to register for summer classes.",

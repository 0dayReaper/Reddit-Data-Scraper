    "postText": "1. I did not need a car. Between Marta, Uber and my feet, I should have saved the money to park my car there for 4 months. Plus I lost a lot of weight walking everywhere. \n2. On Campus housing is way more expensive than finding a place near by and using Marta. My first semester I lived in the lofts. To save money my next semester I moved into the commons. Finally I found a place in Midtown. Midtown was the best choice. I got a private studio next to North Av Station for 1k a month. \n3. Do not count on the Advisor for anything. Once I made it past my required courses, I started meeting with the Director of my Program and He helped create my pathway. Plus it was really great having him on my side when I did have to deal with Advisors. \n4. Financial Aide only works if you are standing in the office. They never answer the phone. They never answer emails, but if I am sitting in front of them refusing to leave until I get an answer....I got the answer. \n5. Go to the rec center early if you really want to work out. Its a ghost town at 6 am. \n6. You have to check in guest to the housing, so if your SO wants to visit let them know they they will be standing in line at the front desk for awhile. \n7. Homeless people are harmless, just say \"no\" and move on, do not take it personally. \n8. I realize I wanted to pivot my senior year, it was going to add more time to me and cost more money and take longer to graduate....but it was totally worth it. \n9. Talk to the professors, I struggled in STATS, but I was always meeting with the professor and asking questions and really showing the effort. I got a little help on the final and finished with an A. \n10. There is no degree that can give you a job. No recommendation can do it either. College is not about your GPA or your membership to a club. Its four to five years showing your willingness to do what your told to someone else's standards. Chances are when you leave there you will not walk into your dream job. When you can show that you offer a company real value in your work, then you get the job. \n\nFeel Free to Add to the list",

Figuratively speaking of course.\n\nIf you repeatedly see questions from your class (accounting and physics...) on chegg, the subscription is worth buying. Just try your best to stay anonymous.\n\nCourses in the first year or two might feel overwhelming depending on your courses and teachers, but if you find yourself with a lot of free time, try to get experience, certifications, or maybe work at a quality company like CFA, Publix, Starbucks, Target, or Home Depot.

For roughly $13 a month you can have unlimited shipments from Walmart and have them delivered to your preferred meeting place.\n\nIt's a lot healthier and much cheaper than eating out constantly.\n\nAlso, don't be afraid to talk to the people around you or even your roommates (if you've got them). I never got to know my first batch of roommates because they always stayed shut in their rooms. \n\nFurthermore, if they bring back the $25 for unlimited panther club refills, get it. It's got so much more to offer than just soda and helped me save money in the long run because I stopped going to the machines.\n\nAlso, rice cookers are a lifesaver. My go to meal usually is rice with green bell peppers, chopped onions, chicken (or really any protein), topped with a sauce of your choice. It's cheap and you can switch up the taste by changing sauces. A real lifesaver when your broke but can't stomach ramen. It also helps that a 2lb bag of rice is super cheap and lasts for weeks.",

It's stressful at first but depending on the dorm it's pretty simple. If you live at the commons you can just have them pull right up to the front or around the side where the parking area is. I usually tell them to park in the paved area right where you pull in (where the U loop is). \n\nJust as a warning though, do yourself a favor and buy a granny cart off of amazon for like $30, it makes everything much easier and they fit perfectly inside the closet.",

Get into internships are soon as possible before your Junior year. \n\n3. If you're going to cheat, don't use GroupMe (if you do THAT, at least don't use your full name or real picture). Depending on your courses, Quizlet is all you need. \n\n4. Before school starts, type out your schedule so you know where everything is and what flexibility you have with your downtime. \n\n5. Go to the gym early in the morning or really anytime on Saturday/Sunday. Less people on campus during the weekends.\n\n6. Understand just because you are in Atlanta by yourself doesn't mean you have to go to every shady flyer party or go to areas you aren't familiar with. Enjoy college but understand it's only YOU that's protecting YOU. Stop putting your trust in people you just met. \n\n7. Pick &amp; choose what classes to skip. If the professor doesn't require attendance and just uses PowerPoints from iCollege, just turn off the alarm and get some extra sleep or at LEAST do something else productive. \n\n8. Going back to #6, stay true to yourself. Seen some folks from high school become \"party promoters\" and those YouTubers who record those cringey videos.. \"WOULD YOU GO OUT WITH ME (GONE WRONG)\" like bruh.. don't allow the city to turn you into something you aren't. Or let it, who am I to tell you not to experiment with yourself during this time.\n\n9. Go the extra mile with your soft skills. Try your best to remember names and faces. Even the little things such as birthdays or a story they told you. Write them in a notepad. Not only are you building friendships, you're gaining connections. I've gotten into places faster and easier from knowing someone from my classes. \n\n10. Invest in a planner. Two, academic and personal. Log what assignments, projects, and tasks you need to do. Log how your day went, what gains you made at the gym, what mistakes you made.\n\n11. Don't buy books lol. Unless that mf is hard to find or a GSU book *cough cough first year of writing cough cough* find an *different* way of obtaining it. Renting or something else...\n\n12. Depending on your major, keep your pre-req notes. Idk I don't have any further info on this it just makes sense to keep the foundation of whatever degree you're pursing (almost threw away my Macro notebook).\n\n13. Soak up the little campus life we have. Attend the football games, our movie theater, club-based events, homecoming parties. Go on Panther Involvement Network and see what clubs are for you. \n\n14. Dress according to the weather. You'll be walking a lot.. don't wear all black in August or think you can get by on shorts during November. Get like 2 umbrellas and a rain jacket because when it rains, it RAINS. \n\n15. Going further with #6, I can't stress this enough, watch your actions. Although you mentally aren't, the law and society has you as an adult. The GSU police station is right next to Walgreens. Be respectful and focus on yourself. I promise you, you do not need to \"scoop up these ATL baddies \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4c\" the minute you step on campus. Applies to both genders, as destroying almost half an apartment complex allegedly over a dude is not it. Avoid altercations or sketchy places with sketchy people you don't know. There's police boxes, counseling centers, and escorts that can drop you off at your dorm.\n\n16. When e-mailing your professor, state what time slot you're in as well as your name in the beginning of your e-mail. Been ignored many times.\n\n17. If you sense a problem in your room, call maintenance immediately. Keep the tickets they give you after they're done in the odd case the school charges you. \n\n18. Apply for scholarships. Go for the smaller awards as many students don't. Unless there's a specific task, most scholarships give you similar prompts. \"Tell me about a time....\" \"What's your strengths &amp; weaknesses\" \"Tell us why you deserve...\" \n\n18. If you shop at Walgreens a lot, a rewards card is worth it.\n\n19. For clean freaks, take multiple showers throughout the day. Walking through shit and piss all day isn't the move. Also, buy a bathroom caddy that fits all your products if you share a bathroom. Go half/half with your roommates when it comes to curtains, soap, toilet paper, or mats.. or don't and horde it all to yourself.\n\n20. Enjoy yourself. Don't overcomplicate anything and do what you came to do. The first week will be riding the The Goliath many times, then the rest of the ENTIRE semester will be the wait time for rides: questioning if it's worth it, aching legs, and loud people in your ear.",

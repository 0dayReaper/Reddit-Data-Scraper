    "postText": "This is a 2 hour boating course where you'll actually go out on the water on a boat with an experienced captain to learn the basics of boating and it is absolutely free.\nNo experience needed, 6 spots available for each course and it runs on Tuesdays!\n\nCalendly link:\nhttps://calendly.com/atlantaacademy/boatsetter-academy-atlanta?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=03162023    \n\nThis is one of 16 cities this course is being run in. The course is funded by the company Boatsetter which I work for, but I promise there will be no time-share speech. We're running this as a separate entity to become the \"Khan Academy of Boating\" aka free boating courses for everyone, forever.\n\nEvery program like this will have an ask, our ask is that you create a Boatsetter account. If you hate the idea of that I get it, but we think the juice is worth the squeeze on this one!\n\nHere's a link to a news article for verification:\n\u00a0https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220823005336/en/Boatsetter-Academy-Becomes-Largest-Free-Boating-School-in-the-U.S.A",

I don\u2019t like the way housing handled stuff any of the years I\u2019ve applied because last year I didn\u2019t get my room till June for the fall! If you are high up on the waiting list there shouldn\u2019t be anything to worry about! :)",

Oh if you meant on the waiting list I was around the top 50ish people on the waitlist after starting at around 400 on the waitlist. When I got to the top 50 that\u2019s when I was able to pick housing. They take people off the waiting list in waves of about 100 people per wave.",

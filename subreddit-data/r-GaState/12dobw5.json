Supposedly I need an updated vaccine but I\u2019ve been enrolled for years without an issue (and the date that it claims I\u2019ve had this hold since was  from 2 years ago)",

I had the same issue the following year. Lol. I don't think they are reading these forms very closely. If they're not answering the phone, you can go to the health center in person and talk with the front desk people. That's what I had to do. If you've received the vaccine, they'll remove the hold. If you haven't, they'll let you schedule an appointment and get it.",

If I needed it 5 years ago, then how did they let me enroll but now I can\u2019t? I also can\u2019t get in touch with anyone in the office to figure out what happened",

I think it was the tdap vaccine a lot of people ended up having to get again as it had been so many years since their last one.\n\nI\u2019m online only and have to submit a waiver every year that I\u2019m not in campus so I don\u2019t have to have them. I think there\u2019s a religious exemption waiver too if you\u2019d rather not mess with it.",

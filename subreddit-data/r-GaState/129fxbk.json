    "postText": "Hey! Please assist me in reaching a conclusion by clearing my doubts.\n\nI got an admission offer from Georgia State University with a 100% out-of-state tuition fee waiver &amp; Mississippi State University with a scholarship of 19k/year in the Computer Science Department. The COA of both universities is similar; consequently, making it hard for me to decide. I have some questions regarding GSU that might help me form a firm decision.\n\n1). GSU has the major advantage of being situated in the heart of Atlanta and hence, becomes more serene and simple for students to get internships and hands-on work experience. However, finding the first internship is always a bit complicated, SO HOW DOES UNIVERSITY HELP STUDENTS TO CRACK THEIR FIRST INTERNSHIPS? DOES GSU ORGANISE SOME KIND OF CAREER FAIR OR IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?\n\n2). Making great connections with professors is necessary to get more opportunities in respective fields. ARE PROFESSORS FRIENDLY (I mean do they get time to engage with their students) and give students research opportunities? WHAT IS THE CLASS SIZE FOR THE COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT?\n\n3). I got accepted by GSU Honors College. DOES IT HAVE ANY SPECIAL BENEFITS? IF YES, WHAT ARE THOSE?\n\n4). What's the environment at GSU among students? Is it competitive or collaborative or both? Does University focus on sports and college fests?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would really be glad to connect with the students to know more about GSU as I would love to become a part of this university. \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Following is going to be a quick but thoughtful ramble:\n\nI assume you're an international student. I just do. \n\n1) You're right about big companies here and basically the environment. There are career fairs at every university and also GSU, yes. But the question is will they be good for you as a first-year student here? Don't know. Probably a little bit of yes and no. It surely is hard to get a first-year internship, especially, this period (telling you as a current first year student), but all of this shit is on your resume- if you got/+get the experience and stuff you can obviously try to get one. I think you already know people people as examples who got internships in first year, and you already know that people generally don't- I'll make something clear it is not because they didn't get one but it doesn't really do you too bad if you don't get one and maybe just chill for the first summer- you can go back back or just stay here and work some easy on-campus summer job.\n\n2) So, it is not really necessary that you will end up getting a comp sci class your first semester. It is likely that you will get one second semester: Principles of Computer Science 1301- your first comp sci class at GSU. A relatively big class than all of your other classes with about 60-70 people- I could be mistaken (took this my first semester and trying to picture the students in class), but the point is that the class size of this comp sci class is not going to be overwhelming at all- Do not even worry about it; no thinking about this anymore. Now, ye make connections with ur professor man, and get em down. That is always good. Will they give you research opportunities? basically, what u wanna be doing is connecting with random/all the professors even if they aren't your direct professors, and a certain yes, they will give you research opportunities even in ur first sem or second sem. ik my direct friends who've gotten such research positions and are getting paid for the same \ud83e\udd1d.\n\n3) Bro, getting into honors college connects you to direct easy easy (research and etc) job opportunities on-campus. take that shit in.\n\n4) Would anyone answer no to competitiveness in school, no to collaboration in school, no to both in school? I would say no to THIS question right here. dont worry about this shit man. ye we football, basketball games BIG BIG that you can watch. you trynna play? i guess not.\n\nI myself am a 100% out-of-state tuition waiver recipient. Looks like you just dont got too much money for school. you are posing georgia tech VS gsu questions . but your trying to decide on msu vs gsu. now come to a decision. i came to gsu \ud83e\udd1d.",

            "comment": "1. Georgia State University sponsors several career fairs, but the best events tend to be the company showcase events where companies such as Delta, UKG, Paramount, etc., spend roughly 4 hours on campus recruiting students for internships and full-time roles. \n\nThe underclassman internships tend to not revolve around what you know, but more around whether if you have the eagerness to learn. I can promise you that if you attend these events, ask good questions, and also join career-focused clubs and events, you will have the necessary skills to secure a freshman or sophomore year internship.\n\n2.Professors are just people, and like all people, some are more helpful than others in finding opportunities. My advice is to ask a lot of questions and learn whether they are a part of the first group. The great thing about Georgia State is that most upperclassmen classes are small, especially in the honors college, which allows for more opportunities to get to know your professors.\n\n3.Being in the honors college gives you first pick when signing up for future classes, and it looks great for any internal applications like for scholarships and programs. The school has a slew of programs that can enhance the quality of your resume, and the honors college tag can help you jump the line. However, outside of the school, I don't see any added value. I've seen honors and non-honors students from the same major get similar paying jobs.\n\n4. Overall,Georgia State University can be both non-competitive and non-collaborative. However, in my experience, when I'm in my honors classes, I've found that there are more students who are invested in the class and the projects. In contrast, in my non-honors classes, I've had to reluctantly take the lead on more than my share of projects, where many students just don't seem to care to help the team or work on their own work. It's worth noting that this isn't always the case, but it's definitely true most of the time.",

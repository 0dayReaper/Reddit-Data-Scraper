I have two paintings I'm working on and my assignment requires an additional digital component. \n\nI would like to produce a sound piece (I'm a musician.) I need to record someone with good enunciation reading a short story. \n\nI have all the audio equipment, just need a volunteer. \n\nMale, Female or Non Binary, doesn't matter.\n\nAny interest?\n\nNot paid",

As long as you don\u2019t take a million years in there, it should be fine. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m highly motivated not to use it because of the awkwardness of coming out and a handicapped person just staring at me. However, if the bathroom is packed, I don\u2019t see why it can\u2019t be used like any other stall\n\nJust don\u2019t leave it a disgusting mess I guess.",

I learned the hard way; a couple years ago I went the the handicap stall in SCE, and I was in there for just two or three minutes and I saw someone with a disability walk up. She had the little forearm crutches and she stood right in front of the door, and I felt so bad. I apologized a lot when I got out (and I picked up the pace), and she accepted my apology, but I still felt so horrible. So I haven't used a handicap stall since lmao. And tbh the person who left the note is completely validated",

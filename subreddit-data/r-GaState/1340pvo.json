If the people that run the city ever decide to address the reasons why people commit crimes etc. instead of throwing more of the budget at policing then you'll find that safety will improve.

Which is to say, while it is not the most safe compared to other college campuses that have a large area dedicated solely to the students and faculty, it is not unsafe. Obviously, it is much safer the it used to be  the past decade because Atlanta as a whole has become much safer. As a current student (through pre and post pandemic), I think that while the school is definitely not excellent in any capacity in terms of safety but, it definitely is a much better environment then it was before the pandemic.",

In none of those cities did I feel as unsafe as I did on GSUs campus, especially at night. Had a lot of racial bullshit said to me as well. I get that GSU can't control every person's behavior that steps on campus.

Any time that I must go to campus, I find myself feeling angry and hateful at the people around me because of how unsafe that I feel. When I was living there, I frequently lashed out at and hurt others because I was always in fight or flight mode. I know that that's more of a me problem but I still think it's worth mentioning, especially if you've got a mental health issue already.",

Unsafe, mismanaged, profs who clearly don't give a shit, horrible clubs and social events, I could go on. \n\nI didn't dorm as I saw it as a waste of money, my friends who did often regretted it. Nothing like spending 10-15k on student housing only to be told not to go out at night. The amount of times the electricity shut off or the water was screwed in dorms sounds horrendous. I am very glad I didn't spend the money to do it. \n\nThere are many times I would be 1)followed by random people on campus 2) straight up threatened 3)saw people shitting on the side of the road. What a beautiful campus \ud83d\ude0d and the security doesn't give a shit. Their best advice is to just not be on campus at night. So much for big city college experiences. My friends going to school in NYC, Philly, London, Shanghai, LA, etc. don't have these issues. \n\nGSU is just not a goal school for most people. It's everyone's safety school. I went because it was cheap and I had HOPE to cover most of my costs. Plus I commuted, so I saved a LOT and didn't have debt. \n\nProfs were often just shitty. There's no other word for it. They either didn't even try to give a shit about their studenrs or job, or would try to \"prove themselves\" and assign useless busy work and give useless feedback just to appear to be doing more work I guess. Never did I have a professor, in any subject, that made me more passionate about the subject. I have learned more about the world and life by traveling solo to different countries than I ever did in that school. \n\nCan't contact financial aid for shit, can't ever get your schedule changed properly, half the time my ID wouldn't work at building security scanners. It's not a good school, it's an okay university that you either go to because you wanna save some money or because you like the idea of being in a big city. Didn't bother showing up to my graduation ceremony. Walked out of my last class with 0 sense of accomplishment, only relief that it was over. To spend a second over the bare minimum I had to at that place was too much for me.",

Truth is GSU is a ghetto ass, dangerous school with constant robberies and assaults. Anyone remember the armed robberies that happened inside the libary? lmao.  it's way more than the normal crime from a metropolitan area.   \n\n\nAlso it's dogshit compared to UGA/GT. They accept anyone, and especially after merging with Perimeter it's such a shitty school.",

I feel like the reputation is excellent in my field and my GSU alumni go to bat for me all the time and have helped me advance my career. As a woman in the night program that took MARTA from 5 Points about 50% of time time, did I feel it was \"unsafe\". No not really. I generally felt safe. If there was cause for concern I would request a security escort to my car or the train station and was always provided one. I've lived within 5 miles of downtown Atlanta since 2012 though. I feel like downtown Atlanta is my community and while there are dangerous elements like in all cities, I feel like Atlanta is mostly safe.\n\nSince you are saying this is a research paper, I am curious what your metrics are. Are you simplying studying people's \"feelings\" or media coverage of crime and disruptiveness? Are you actually looking at real quantifiable metrics like crime statistics (including conviction and dismissal rates), income, vacant housing numbers, employment numbers.",

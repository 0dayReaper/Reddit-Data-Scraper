    "postText": "I find it sad how the culture of GSU academics often revolves around transferring to Georgia Tech. When I was in my pre-college years, I thought college brand name mattered a lot and initially wanted to transfer to Georgia Tech for my Junior year. I suppose since 2020 is when covid occurred, my first year of college was entirely online, and I did not realize how little transferring actually matters. Once I started taking in-person classes and interacting with professors, I realized how transferring to a more prestigious college would do virtually nothing for me. The professor quality at GSU is really good for the most part unless you take a class with a graduate school student. I also felt I was learning a lot in my classes. Getting a job is almost entirely about what and who you know. This post is not to discourage people from transferring to a different university if they want to for other reasons such as getting a better social life, but I do not think it alone has a considerable impact on job placement.",

In my case, I was going to transfer to GT using the conditional acceptance pathway a couple years ago, but I was advised by my cousin that GT isn\u2019t worth it for premeds. GPA is key and I was acing classes here, so why go to GT and risk tanking my GPA. Prestige isn\u2019t focused on much for medical schools unless you\u2019re at HPYS. Did great here as a premed during my time at GSU and highly recommend people to stay here! Courses here gave me enough pre-requisite info for the MCAT.",

                            "comment": "Howdy! If you're in the Atlanta Campus, they only offer 2215, which only covers calc 3 up to Multiple Integrals, leaving out Vector Calculus with stuff like Green's Theorem and Stokes' Theorem. If you're planning on staying at GSU, this shouldn't be a problem since Vector Calc at GSU picks up right where 2215 leaves off, so overall it shouldn't cause any problems.\n\nAs for 2551, it's how you'd learn calc 3 at any other university or high school, which includes the vector calculus segment at the end. It's only offered in the perimeter college. As for the semesters it's offered, I, along with a few friends, were all told that it was only avalible in the summer. However, we met someone that took it in the fall while we were taking 2215, which goes to show that there's a lot of digging you'll need to do on your end to build off from this.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't have a problem if they offered 2551 in the Atlanta Campus. However, they don't and as a transfer student, it could lead anywhere from an inconvenience (like in my case as a CS major) to an outright waste of time and resources like an engineering major that's required to take 2551.\n\nSorry for making this a very long read, but I hope this helps out!\n\nEDIT: As Hollytot added, if you're able to take classes in the summer, shouldn't be much of a problem if you're still transferring. That being said, look into when all the deadlines for your documents are and make sure you can take classes a certain semester and still send them in your transcript.",

Along with ur input i did some research and it looks like I will be doing Math 2551 as opposed to 2215 as like you said it transfers to other colleges as MVC class and doesnt make me take another class. I plan on majoring in industrial engineering to and often MVC is a requirement so all the more reason to take 2551.\n\n\nSo i Come from AP calculus BC, and i was wondering if that will be enough for me to succeed in 2551 (I will also be doing math 2641 in the fall). Idk how likely it is but hopefully they offer 2551 next spring :) . Once again thank you for helping me out and sorry for the lengthy response haha",

If you have the agency to learn and take the proactiveness to establish connections and seek work, you\u2019ll be fine regardless.\n\nHowever in terms of academia, GT looks way better on a resume if you\u2019re blindly applying for entry level jobs due to the sheer prestige tech holds not just in Georgia but the country. They have way better programs for STEM based careers and the rigor of their courses is next to none in comparison to other USG schools. Transferring is overrated and I hate the stigma of graduating from a \u201cstate\u201d school, especially the hate and transfer culture we have here at State but there definitely is a ton of benefits from transferring too. \n\nMy advice is that it\u2019s completely major dependent and based on the person. The workload shifts completely at tech however.",

I understand you have work but there is a lot of things they help you out with during that time. It is important and I am sure your employer can spare you the time!",

As you are a freshman entering college with little knowledge about the things they will be going over which is very important for the next 4 years ? You will be registering for classes which is VERY important so you can get the times you want and overall receiving important information for years to come",

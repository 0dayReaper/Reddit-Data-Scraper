    "postText": "Just transitioned to Atlanta campus for the summer as I will have completed my Associates at Perimeter. Me academic evaluation shows I need 3 credit hours in Area F (planning on CHEM 1211) and MATH 2641. I was hoping to take these at Perimeter still but I've found that I would need an advanced written authorization but I cannot for the life of me figure out who my new advisor is or how to schedule an appointment. Prior, I would go through Navigate and set up an appointment, and now, it's still the previous advisor scheduled for Perimeter UAC. Trying to get this done so I can register for Perimeter classes while registration and spots are open.",

They gave me the cross level registration to sign but I did not have the 12 credit hours needed at Atlanta campus so they said it was a 50/50. Just waiting now \ud83e\udd1e",

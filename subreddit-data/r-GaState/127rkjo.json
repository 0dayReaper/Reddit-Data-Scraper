            "comment": "hi, I have done 2 bio classes and lab online (1103 and 1104). For the lecture part of the class, you really have to stay on top of the reading or you\u2019ll fall behind. There are also weekly icollege quizzes that are open note depending on the professor (for 1103 I had ezeoke). The lab portion was pretty easy, and are on a platform called labster. For 1104, I have todaro and he uses a platform called achieve (and there\u2019s usually 1-3 chapters to read per week and the guided assignments on the platform with extra credit too). The lab for 1104 was the same as 1103.",

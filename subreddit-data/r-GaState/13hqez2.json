Do you think driving or living near a Marta station is more important? Which areas of Atlanta is best for student life?\n\nI\u2019m a grad student looking to live IN atlanta - not in a neighboring county and commute. I don\u2019t know the ins and outs of living in Atlanta while attending gsu so tell me your thoughts!",

It was close enough but still quieter than downtown Atlanta, and the blue Marta line is usually less crowded than the red/yellow.",

I have lived in the Decatur area for my whole program but my quality of life improved so much when I moved closer to the train and didn\u2019t have to drive. Decatur/Avondale area is also pretty safe with a lot to do and it\u2019s cheaper than being in the city of Atlanta (but is still in the perimeter so not really the suburbs)",

If you are looking for a place to stay and don\u2019t mind living in Old Fourth Ward, you can DM me. It\u2019s a 20 min walk but not too terrible since GSU has busses (: I also know a little bit about the moving situation off campus and on campus, so feel free to ask!!",

He does the homework in class for you to either follow along or try to solve with the answer available to submit. \n\nFendler is rough but he curves the crap out of everything. It's like a secret curve. There is a bell curve requirement in grades where x% needs to be in the A range, y% for the B range, and z% for the C range. \n\nLGLS you have to do 3 FIRAC papers. They are specifically in a formated way that after your first paper, it will be an absolute breeze. \n\nAll in all, go for option 2. You graduate early and you get rid of all the annoying electives.",

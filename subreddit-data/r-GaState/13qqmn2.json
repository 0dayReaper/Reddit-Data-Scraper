However, when I renewed my lease last year they forgot to reserve my room (apparently) and so I had to move from the 2nd floor to the basement floor. The room I moved into was in worse condition than my original, and yet the price of my rent was increased. The power in my room would go out if I plugged my blow dryer in while the lights were on, and whenever I put on a ticket they say the problem was fixed but it would continue to happen.\n\nThey also once threatened eviction because the trash valet wouldn\u2019t pick up the trash for days, and we left the bins in the hallway. We pay for it, yet it would be a hit or miss on if it gets picked up. And if we tried to throw it out ourselves the maintenance men would tell me and my roommates to just wait for pickup. It was causing our apartments and hallways to smell so bad, and get bugs. It wouldn\u2019t have made me so upset if they didn\u2019t threaten to evict us over leaving it in the hallways because what other option did we have? Stinky house or eviction. I moved out because I couldn\u2019t deal with the bs anymore.",

The racetrac needs to go, nobody who hangs out at the racetrac has any good intentions. There needs to be police there all the time and also on JWD pretty much 24 hours. Nobody is gonna start shooting at each other if there\u2019s a cop car right there. They need to utilize the alert system more. There was literally a shooting outside student housing on Tuesday and there wasn\u2019t an alert or an email sent out about it telling people to avoid that area. Again, nothing is gonna be perfect it\u2019s atlanta, but GSU can\u2019t keep acting like they\u2019re helpless.",

I have seen cops posted outside racetrac for most of the time since the one of the police offices is right next door, but they recently haven't been there. I think it might be because of protests, since I haven't seen them anywhere unlike the other 3 years I have been here",

I took research design with meacham and I thought the course was mostly easy as long as you do all the required readings and watch most of the lectures. There were multiple lectures each week, but many of them short (I\u2019m talking 15-20 min). Granted, I also already had stats experience so the stats portion was review for me. There was also a lot of extra credit opportunities for that course and they drop your lowest grade in each category. Psychopathology had super easy exams, as long as you take good notes for each chapter. There were several chapters where we weren\u2019t even assessed on certain parts of the chapter. Good luck! If you ever want a study buddy for atypical child, hmu!",

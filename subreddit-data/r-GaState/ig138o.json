So tomorrow choose one class and go thru the welcome module, syllabus, and look over the first couple assignments and write down due dates. Take a break, then if you feel up to it, look thru another class.\n\n\nEase in by orienting yourself to each class and understanding what each is asking of you. Maybe write a weekly to-do list and update due dates in your calendar. Then you can turn to actually doing the assignments. Take it easy, you'll get into rhythm soon enough :)",

If you don\u2019t have meeting times for your classes try to schedule different days for different classes if you can. \n\nI know it\u2019s a lot but focus on the first three days and then once you have that done go to the next! \n\nIf you need to vent feel free to message me :)",

Take it one day at a time, and remember to give yourself breaks and patience. Your mental health and body is forever but your grades are not. It\u2019ll just take some time for all of this to get into a routine, but once you do it\u2019ll be a lot easier. And your professors already start talking about all of these books, access codes, assignments, etc. They\u2019re just introducing them, you don\u2019t have to get it all done today, take your time, you have all week. \n\nThe person above gave good advice, I would focus on maybe 2 classes a day or whatever you can. Most Professors are super understanding, this is an adjustment for them too so they are also trying to figure things out so they understand some confusion and stress. And don\u2019t feel unprepared, only so much you can do to prepare. Anything you need help with let me know!",

Secondly as has been said before, set a schedule for yourself, and stick to it, remembering to add in a 10 minute break per hour and a full hour after 4 hours.  I have done many many online classes and this has helped me.  Set aside your study area, this is your space to learn in, i.e. your books, note pads, pens, a place to put your computer down etc.. It is doable, you have the strength to do this and do well.",

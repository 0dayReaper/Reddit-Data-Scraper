    "postText": "Hey CIS majors?! Is there anyone else that failed the CIS Career Advancement work, by not turning in one thing? \n\nI\u2019ve tried contacting Professor Dr. PrBhashi Herath, but no reply. I\u2019ve contacted my advisor and they really can\u2019t do anything. \n\nIf you fail CIS Career Advancement you fail Into-Programming or it\u2019s marked Incomplete which affects all following CIS major classes or some. \n\nIf you\u2019re having a similar issue please upvote/comment I think we need to come together to talk to the CIS department and see if it can be changed. Maybe for it to be in-forced to graduate, but not hold you back from taking required classes. This course does not carry a credit which is why it\u2019s so frustrating. I understand the importance of attention to detail and networking, but this can set back a lot of students who simply don\u2019t know or made a mistake.",

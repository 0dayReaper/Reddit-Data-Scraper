    "postText": "So I signed up for summer classes again this time. Last time I signed up for it I didn\u2019t have to pay anything but this time it\u2019s telling me I have to pay $1800 after financial aid and I took out loans for this year just like I did last year so I was hoping it would have all been paid for\u2026 Is it because I signed up for 3 classes instead of 2?\nIf anyone could help me understand the situation I would really appreciate it \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

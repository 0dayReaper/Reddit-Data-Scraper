    "postText": "So, I had an advisement appointment and my advisor said that all I had left to complete were arts and science electives and my psych research classes. I guess I\u2019m just confused on the arts and science electives part because when I go to degree works it says that I still have psych courses I need to complete outside of the research classes. But I\u2019m even more confused because after this semester I will have 97 credit hours complete so it kinda makes sense what my advisor said?? On top of that she also said that I should take psych 3530 over the summer so I can take upper level psych classes in the fall, but I already registered for the upper level psych classes for the summer w/o psych 3530 so I am LOST.",

Check the prerequisites of the classes you registered for summer and the classes you need to take in the fall. \n\nAsk your advisor to create a graduation plan with all the recommended classes for each term and then compare it to degree works",

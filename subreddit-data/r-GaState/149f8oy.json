    "postText": "Has anyone else at GSU taken classes at community college and successfully transferred them over to GSU? I'm an incoming freshman, and I want to take some core classes, but to my understanding the core classes aren't worth the cost at GSU, and it'd be better to take them at a community college. I'd really like to explore this option",

Core requirements can still difference between the two depending on the associates pathway you begin in and then which bachelors you want to transition to.\n\nIf you want to begin at PC this fall you\u2019ll need to talk to admissions asap if you\u2019ve been accepted at GSU in the fall. You can google them for the number. But if you just want to take some core classes at PC over the summer, you\u2019re able to do that as well to save money, take some core courses, and begin at GSU in the fall.",

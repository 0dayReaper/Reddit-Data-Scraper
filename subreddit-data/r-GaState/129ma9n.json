From everything I\u2019ve read zell miller doesn\u2019t care if your a full or part time student so it should cover the cost (assuming I keep my gpa after the spring) for my 3 credit hour class? I should just be paying student fees next semester\u2019s unless I\u2019m wrong. If anyone has any experience with this can you tell me if I\u2019m thinking right or no. Thanks!",

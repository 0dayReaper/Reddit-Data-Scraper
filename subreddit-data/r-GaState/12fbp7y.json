I submitted the order thinking nothing of it and it will be shipped to my dorm address in commons. Will the mailroom let me get my package if I explain my situation or am I out of luck?",

I explained that to the mailroom, showed the tracking number, and they still gave it to me. So maybe they\u2019ll still give it to you as long as you have the tracking number!",

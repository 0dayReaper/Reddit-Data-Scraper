I won\u2019t be anywhere near campus spring semester so no, I don\u2019t need that rec fee, library fee, library facility fee, athletic fee, international fee (I\u2019m in-state anyways), transportation fee, activity fee, health fee, nor even $50 lab fee for online labs. In fact tuition shouldn\u2019t even be at full price because I\u2019m literally just sitting in front of a screen all day every day teaching myself and watching professors struggle to use webex.",

The fees bring in revenue and was accounted for in the budget. It's a necessary evil right now because COVID threw in a budget crunch. It keeps from jobs being cut first ones being student jobs.",

The university wouldn\u2019t qualify for the government assistance and many of the grants it receives if it was a for-profit school. \n\nAlthough our school isn\u2019t a rich private for-profit school charging 40k tuition, I agree that some of the fees need to be cut. But I also realize the fees didn\u2019t change because the cost of staffing and the upkeep of the facilities that staff use throughout the semester. So I'm torn about it overall.\n\nThe general price of Higher Education in this country is lucrative, but we honestly go to one of the cheaper schools by comparison. Considering the current government, which created this economic climate, GSU isn\u2019t bad for the price. But I do fear with the university\u2019s expanding notoriety and new event centers, it could become another UGA or GA Tech cost wise. But even then, it'll still be cheaper than private schools.\n\nBlame the government.",

Tuition covers many expenses at a school, but the main expense includes salaries for teachers, custodians, student workers, etc. (i.e. everyday people). GSU needs to be a competitive employer if it wants to attract and keep these employees. This employer-employee cycle allows GSU to innovate and become a better school, enabling it to attract more students and better employees. Many employees demand better pay because of the increasing cost of living. GSU being limited on the amount of tuition it can charge a student determines their competitiveness. They\u2019ll need to make up that lost money someway, which is through fees, donations, grants, government assistance, etc. \n\nAgain we only see these problems because our government allowed this to get out of control. Governments determine the cost of living. The government determines the amount of money a public-funded school can receive; the government decides which student will receive financial assistance and how much. The government also determines how anything money related is repaid. \n\nBlame the government.",

From my understanding, living comfortably depends on the COL, which is set by the government. GSU keeps its non-profit status by telling the government how it\u2019s distributing the money it receives from the students, sponsors, grants, etc. The main reason for being nonprofit is tax exemptions but being non-profit also means the school is subject to the community\u2019s opinions. This scrutiny forces the university to account for every dollar it receives from the students. \n\nA considerable chunk of this money comes from the government. GSU has a lot of kids that are eligible for and receive pell and HOPE, which translates to a lot of students getting money from the government. I think being non-profit restricts GSU because the government decides how much money it wants to give students. If students can\u2019t afford GSU with pell and HOPE, many would either not go or drop out in a year or two. GSU doesn\u2019t want to cut its lifeline, so it has to set a price they know the government would cover. They have to tell the government how they are using that money. The government practically determines how the school uses this money to keep that nonprofit tax-exempted status.\n\nGoing back to what I said about community opinions weighing heavy on GSU, if the school started randomly overcharging us, there would be a communal outcry. Maybe even call for an investigation of some sort. These actions would damage the school's reputation and cause it to lose a lot of the money it receives not only from the students but also from other entities. An example of a school losing money like this is Morris Brown college. GSU is \u201ccheaper\u201d than most schools its size because of how dependent it is on the government, and because of the simple fact, it\u2019s restricted as a non-profit. \n\nAnd I'm not saying GSU or any non-profit is free of corruption but, it\u2019s pretty hard to get away with misusing money from a non-profit organization after a while. GSU has been a nonprofit for a very long time.\n\nBlame the government.",

The state constitution requires a balanced budget. If fees are cut, spending becomes higher than revenue leading to budget cuts across all public universities this leading to student jobs (assistant-ships, TA's and other jobs like tour guides etc.) to occur.",

    "postText": "So my wallet got stolen today and now I don\u2019t have any forms of identification besides my birth certificate. I ordered a replacement drivers license but that won\u2019t be here for 30ish days. If I buy a replacement panther card online to pick up on campus will I need to show any proof of identity or can I just show my confirmation email? If so would just a birth certificate work because I would hate to wait the 30 something days for my replacement ID to come in the mail",

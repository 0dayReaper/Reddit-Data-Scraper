Life has been extremely hard for me lately due to several circumstances i don\u2019t want to get into and this situation is just making it worse. Just looking for some encouraging words.",

I\u2019ve had to take semesters off in the past to get things in order, and as much as it sucks to feel \u201cbehind,\u201d whatever that means, it\u2019s better to be able to put your best foot forward than to sink deeper into the pit.\n\nYou got this, I believe in you, just take a deep breath and realize next semester is a clean slate.",

I was never expelled, but I did make it on academic probation a couple of times at my first university.\n\nThird, I personally know a great guy who *has* been in your position, I believe more than once (but don\u2019t quote me on that).\n\nHe\u2019s now a PhD student.\n\nFinally, I want to just give you my academic timeline in hopes that it\u2019ll help instill the idea that not all is lost, and you always have the chance to get back up after you\u2019ve fallen.\n\nI dropped out of high school the last semester of my senior year. I hated school, I was going through a lot, and I just decided one day I\u2019m not stepping foot back on that campus.\n\nImmediately got my GED and started at the local technical college the fall after I would have graduated from high school, so I didn\u2019t really miss a beat.\n\nGraduated with honors with an Associates Degree in Paramedicine. I\u2019ve been a paramedic ever since, going on 12 years now.\n\nA couple of years after being a paramedic I knew I wanted to advance and decided to attempt the path to med school, which meant I had to finish my bachelor\u2019s and pre-med classes.\n\nI was so excited and driven, but had so much trouble at my first university.\n\nFirst, I had to work to support myself, and I was trying to pay tuition out of pocket, which meant working insane hours that took me away from studying.\n\nSecond, my 20s were just a mess. My relationship with the person I had planned on marrying and having a family with went up in flames, and around this time I had been diagnosed with OCD and fell into a deep depression.\n\nWas in and out of school for several semesters, sometimes doing well, sometimes doing horribly. On and off several medications whose side effects kept getting in the way of succeeding at school.\n\nThankfully, I flourished at work and still loved my job. That kept my head above water and my determination strong, as well as keeping some meaning and fulfillment in my life.\n\nI had a friend who was living in Atlanta who had said I needed to get out of my environment and start fresh, and that I should move up here.\n\nImmediately after this conversation I accidentally stumbled upon a job opportunity here that had better hours and pay, so I thought it could work to help me finally finish my bachelor\u2019s.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I did. In less than a month I was in Atlanta, crashing in my friend\u2019s tiny living room, working the new job, and looking at universities.\n\nTo make a short story long, I ended up at Georgia State studying neuroscience. I had enough credits from my old university where I studied psychology to be able to automatically get a minor here, but being the stubborn Jedi that I am, I took on psychology as a second major my senior year.\n\nFor the most part, normal and random bumps in the road that life throws at you aside, everything was going very well. The pandemic threw a wrench in everything for everyone, and I dropped all but one class the spring semester we shut down because it was simply a crazy time and a hard adjustment, but I picked everything back up that summer and just kept moving forward.\n\nThen my dad died of COVID my last full semester here. It was spring, I was taking a full course load, and I had one summer class left to graduate. He was so excited to finally see me graduate after everything I had been through, and he missed it by six months. Somehow I finished off strong enough to still graduate magna cum laude, with that spring semester miraculously being my best semester GPA yet (no fucking clue how), but I really phoned it in on my final summer class and somehow passed by the skin of my teeth.\n\nI was supposed to take the MCAT and apply to med school last year. That didn\u2019t happen. I was supposed to take the MCAT and apply to med school *this* year. That still hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nLast year was the deepest depression I may have ever been in, which is saying a lot. There probably wasn\u2019t a day that went by that I wasn\u2019t drinking.\n\nI finally got some help, and I\u2019m *finally*, a year and a half after he died and about a year after I graduated, am starting to (very) slowly feel like myself again.\n\n(I should also point out, that while getting help, I was *also* diagnosed with ADHD. No wonder I had so much trouble with school throughout my life! And of course I had to get this diagnosis *after* I graduated, right? So that\u2019s been fun to have to wrap my head around and figure out.)\n\nI\u2019m hoping that soon I\u2019ll be back to studying for the MCAT, blow it out of the water, and *finally,* after nearly a decade at the great age of 33, apply to med school.\n\nNo guarantee I\u2019ll get in, but I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I come to it.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, this turned into a bit more of a venting session, and way longer than I had planned. I just wanted to give you some real stories of people who overcame hardships, even as full grown adults, and still became successful in the ways they wanted.\n\nSo, again, just take a deep breath, understand that this event does not define you or your path, and figure out what\u2019s next for you.\n\nI believe in you.",

I heavily relate to your story as I also had similar struggles and wanted to do better but seemed to always come back in a full circle to failing. No matter how hard I try or how different I go about things, it never seems to get better until I was later diagnosed with adhd last semester. I'm proud of you for coming this far and really hope the best for the next chapter in life. Also, OP, don't give up !!! they are so many people who can deeply relate to your situation. I do feel as though you may have needed the right channel of resources at GSU.  I hope you can take a break and sincerely wish the best for you for your next chapter. If you may think that there is something that is holding you back from succeeding, please seek resources you deem fit for you.",

It was so frustrating using every tool in there and them not working, especially when I see others using the same toolbox and succeeding.\n\nNow I just have to get a new toolbox and learn how to use those tools. It\u2019s going to be a journey.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to struggle with it as well, but glad you were finally able to get some answers and can get the proper treatment to help you move forward.",

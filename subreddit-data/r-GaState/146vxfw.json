You want to figure out your strengths and weaknesses and study your weaknesses. There are 3 sections of the Accuplacer math test: arithmetic, advanced algebra and functions, and quantitative reasoning, algebra, and statistics. This video is helpful for getting you oriented with how to start studying and getting oriented with the math section. Youtube is a great resource, there are dozens of videos hours long that do Accuplacer review. [https://youtu.be/qEl\\_F5RA-Ws](https://youtu.be/qEl_F5RA-Ws)",

            "comment": "&gt; Immediately report the lost or stolen card in person at the PantherCard Office or contact us at 404-413-9508 during hours of operation.  After hours, report the lost or stolen card to the Georgia State University Police at 404-413-2100. Return to any of the PantherCard Offices the following business day to receive a new card. The owner of the card is responsible for all usage of the card prior to proper notification to the PantherCard office or to the Georgia State University Police. There is a fee of $25.00 for all replacement cards and you are required to take a new photo. Payment can be made online [here](https://secure.touchnet.com/C20797_ustores/web/store_main.jsp?STOREID=312&amp;SINGLESTORE=true) so that the PantherCard can be reissued. Replaced PantherCards cannot be reactivated if found. Your PantherCard is treated like a lost or stolen credit/debit card. Lost IDs turned into the PantherCard office are discarded at the end of each business day for security reasons.\n\nFrom [the PantherCard site](https://services.gsu.edu/panthercard)",

    "postText": " Hi Ga State! I have started a tutoring initiative for science courses such as biology, chemistry, anatomy and physiology. I have a Master's in Biomedical Sciences and will be going to medical school. There will be ample resources for each topic. In addition, I am very flexible. I also provide guidance for students wanting to pursue a career in the healthcare field. I can take a look at college apps and helps students who want to shadow. Please contact me if you are interested!",

We have a structured format of tutoring with ample resources. Our job is to make sure you succeed. A lot of our students do prefer outside tutoring companies!",

I don't have recommendations for PLC; I suggest you take an online course on the side if the topics interest you. The stuff I experienced is not worth the tuition money I paid (rote memorization, boring, redundant .pptx lectures). That said, PLC is likely to be a cakewalk if you've taken Automata. That's unsurprising as both deal with programming languages, with automata doing so from a much more fundamental level.\n\nNote: my recommendations are not the easy/cool/chill route.",

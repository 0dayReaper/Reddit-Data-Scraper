    "postText": "So I lost my hope scholarship and I feel like I lost my actual hope lol. The thought of the extra tuition on top of the loans I already have makes my stomach churn and like I fucked up everything. I\u2019m a junior so that doesn\u2019t help either. I don\u2019t want to give up, I have a clear vision for my degree and career, but I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ve screwed myself financially in a huge way. Just wanted to rant but any advice is welcome.",

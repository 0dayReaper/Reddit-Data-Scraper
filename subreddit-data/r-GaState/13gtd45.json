    "postText": "So I heard it was being phased out starting fall semester 2023 and there are already new courses such as software development and capstone I &amp; II. \n\nMy catalog only requires CSC 4350 (software engineering) to graduate. I understand the newer CS catalogs requires software development and capstone I &amp; II. \n\nI was planning to take CSC 4350 in the spring semester 2024. And I was set to graduate spring semester 2024.\n\nSo my question is has anyone heard about this as well? I\u2019m going to confirm with the CS department and advisor just in case. \n\nIf it\u2019s true then I\u2019m hoping that they have a replacement course because the capstones are only available for specific semesters which can push my graduation back.",

            "comment": "Really only the department or an academic advisor is going to be able to help you with this. But as an academic advisor, I can tell you that if you are already in an older catalog year, you\u2019re able to remain in the catalog year. But if you want to change to the newer catalog, you will have to talk to an academic advisor to update to the newer catalog and meet all new catalog requirements.\n\nFor instants, I once had a Deaf Studies student who was able to pass three classes, only because they were using an old catalog, which allowed them to get a C in those classes. That student wanted to switch to a newer catalog, because they thought that it would require less courses for them. However, the student was not aware that in the new catalog, they had to get a B or higher, and all of those same classes, which means they had to repeat them. \n\nIf you\u2019re at 90 credits or more, talk to your senior advisor. If you have not yet received 90 credits or more, you can talk to your undergraduate advisor. If you are a graduate student, you can talk to the department itself for advisement. Hope all of this translated well, I\u2019m using talk to text and I know sometimes there are typos. Have a good one!",

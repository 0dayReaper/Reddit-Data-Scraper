So there\u2019s very little benefit for wearing a mask, specially a clothe mask. I\u2019m all for wearing one, specially when I\u2019m indoor with several people, but forcing someone to wear it is just not right. And come on, saying things like we all gonna die because of this is just inaccurate.",

Had that person been wearing a mask, it would be less likely that you\u2019d get infected (especially with adequate distance).\n\nThe thing is, wearing a mask isn\u2019t intended to protect you, but to protect others from asymptomatic spread of COVID.\n\nAs \u201cineffective\u201d as you believe that masks are, it truly is the BARE MINIMUM you can and SHOULD do if social distancing isn\u2019t possible. \n\n\u201cForcing\u201d people to wear masks in public is no different than being \u201cforced\u201d to wear a seatbelt in an automobile.

    "postText": "I\u2019m planning on taking Non-RCB electives CPS ( Counseling &amp; Psych services) 3200 &amp; 3300 together for the Fall semester.\n\nI heard it\u2019s an easy class, but I want to know what were some of the experiences with this class. I heard that students use a different platform instead of Icollege. What are the quizzes and exams like ? Are they on some kind of lockdown browser? Do they post grades onto icollege ? How heavy is this class ? Is there some kind of instructor you can speak with for help? Etc.",

There are 4 exams and u can decide to either do 4 surveys or complete a paper . Choose the surveys and do them faster so you don\u2019t have to worry about writing a bloody paper. Take the class if you want something low paced. You do it at your own time . That\u2019s y I love it",

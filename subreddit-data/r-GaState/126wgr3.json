    "postText": "I'm a film major entering my junior year this fall, and class registration opens for me tomorrow. I've done all my prereqs and have done a few summer courses so I'm a tiny bit ahead, but not by too much. However, looking at what classes are available for next semester, there isn't anything open for me. I'm fucked now and couldn't do anything, even while trying to plan ahead. I can hope to get lucky and wait for someone to drop the class, but that's what I tried to do this semester and that also fucked me over. Should I try to email the teacher asking if they can fit one more? The only film class that actually interests me is fiction film production, and I really wanted to take digital cinematography and editing, but now its completely full. I already wasted this semester, I cant really afford another semester of doing nothing. Has any other film major gone through this, or does anyone have any advice on what I could do next? My minor is GFA, which I'm planning to take over the summer and next spring",

Existing faculty are assumed to take up this slack without any compensation.  Staff that were let go during Covid are not being hired back which means the remaining faculty are expected to take up their service work too. So it might be realistic to say most teachers are not going to agree to larger classes or additional sections with no increase in pay.  I\u2019m afraid getting into classes is going to be quite competitive from here on out.",

You gotta be proactive at gsu as someone said I\u2019ve had tons of issues like this here and reaching out to ppl in department had literally solved it every time. I\u2019m a cis major tho so slightly different but do the same thing and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be good",

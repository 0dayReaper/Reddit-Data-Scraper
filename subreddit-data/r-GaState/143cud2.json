It can take several days after that for the funds to be in your bank account (and remember Monday the 19th is a federal holiday so banks will be closed, likely adding a day into that)",

There's a specific date that enrollments are checked (this is why it's important that you go to  class and do assignments early in the term!) -  students not attending class are dropped from the course and financial aid is adjusted/removed.  I believe this is the 8th day of classes every semester. \n\nAfter that, if you have a negative balance in your paws account, it will zero out at some point between then and Friday - this means your refund for that negative amount is processing.  Those are sent out through bankmobile and will reach your bank account - the time that takes can vary based on your bank.",

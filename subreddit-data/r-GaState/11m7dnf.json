    "postText": "Hi! I've asked you guys on this reddit a few times for advice, and I'm asking it again.\n\nI've finally got my living situation under control and I've sat down to write out my Emergency Withdrawal application for last semester, got it proofread, and have submitted it. I am aware that they seemingly only review these at the end of the month... so will I not hear back until April?\n\nAlso, I am curious about whether or not I should also go ahead and apply for Exclusion Appeal, or wait to see what the result of the Emergency Withdrawal application is. If the EW application gets accepted, I've been told that it would raise my GPA high enough to reverse my Exclusion status, but I don't know. I've had very little guidance from quite literally anyone when it comes to this stuff.\n\nAlso, does anyone know how hard or easy it is to apply and get into Perimeter campus? I'd like to also do this as a final backup solution in case everything else fails.",

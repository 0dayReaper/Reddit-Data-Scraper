            "comment": "I'm taking Aria currently. While I can see the reasons as to why many students dislike his class and think its hard, I genuinely enjoy it and feel like I'm learning a lot from him.\n\nHe makes it very clear from the start that you need to spend hours practicing on your own outside of class. He's going to repeatedly tell you that you need to basically \"master\" each chapter he discusses as they build off of each other. It sounds daunting having to sit down for an hour or 3 to practice, but just do it. You're going to struggle more than you should to code on the exam if you don't practice in your free time. \n\nAs for the B requirement, he often told us that as long as he sees you are trying, improving, and working hard at practicing and learning code, you'll end up with a B (meaning he may help you out at the end of the semester if you're close to getting a B).",

            "comment": "I'll tell you what I tell everyone who wants or needs to take CIS 3260. First, ask yourself this: do I want to learn the basics of programming or do I want to simply pass the class?\n\nIf you want to learn the basics, Aria will be the best professor to guide you. He will go through all the basics plus more and test you according to computer science standards instead of the CIS standards you might expect. Additionally, he's the main professor for the app development track, so he's a good reference to learn more about that track.\n\nIf you simply want to pass, I would say DO NOT TAKE HIM. Aria does not care if you're taking five classes, have a part-time job, or live 30 minutes away from campus; you are expected to put your all into his class. Don't get me wrong, he is lenient with some turn-in dates, and the class is on a curve, but don't expect an easy B. Another way to put it is, if you're in the process innovation or cybersecurity track, he will be a pain in the butt.",

I made a few friends from some classes that I talked to several times and linked up with on facebook, but that was the extent of it. I was mostly stuck in my own bubble. I honestly wanted a lot more of the social aspects of the college experience and I really just didn\u2019t get that. It\u2019s more on me than GSU, but I think that\u2019s one of the reasons I found this dumb wall scribble to be so oddly comforting.",

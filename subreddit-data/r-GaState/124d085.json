            "comment": "CIS 3260 - I took this online with Montez Robinson, I would definitely recommend this if you're looking for an easy A. \n\nMGT 3100 - I'm taking this right now with Wendy Roth, it's a hybrid class now so there are no more online sections. The course is very easy, Excel based. You only have to go in one day a week to do a quiz, and if you finish early you can sign the attendance and leave. \n\nBCOM 3950 - I'm taking this online right now with Tia Forbes. I would definitely recommend doing this one online, because all of the work can be completed from home. There is a lot of work to do for this course, but it is all easy. \n\nMK 3010 - I took this online last semester with Yi Zhao, it was a very easy course with not too much work to do each week. It was not synchronous. \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",

But I see that she a has a really low rating on rate my professor where students say that she doesn\u2019t care much for her students, that her due dates are unorganized, and so on. How accurate would you say these ratings are ? \n\nAlso how are the online exam structures for BCOM 3950 &amp; Mk 3010? (MGT 3400 &amp; LGLS 3610 as well if you have taken that online)",

For MK 3010, it was all multiple choice with lockdown browser and Webcam. For MGT 3400, I took that in person but our exams were not monitored, all multiple choice. For LGLS 3610, we would log into the webex and take our exam in there, all multiple choice.",

I know many people, myself included, that are working for the big 4 as tech/cybersecurity consultants. I know others that work at Amazon and Microsoft. It's easier to be exceptional at Georgia State than it is at UGA, and that is what is gonna get you a nice job when it comes down to it.",

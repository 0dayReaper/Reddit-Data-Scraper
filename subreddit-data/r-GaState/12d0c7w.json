    "postText": "I am considering taking the CLEP exam for Spanish language as I have native experience and have taken 4 years worth of Spanish classes. If anyone has any relevant info or experience with the exam please share. I am confident in vocabulary but not very advanced past high school Spanish III in grammar. Is the exam grammar heavy? Are there any good practice resources? ",

The second half of the exam it's filling out gaps in the text in which you need to pick either the correct word or tense in order for it to make sense. DM if you have more questions!",

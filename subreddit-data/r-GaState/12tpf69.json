    "postText": "It would be my first hackathon but I\u2019m getting cold feet. I barely know coding (I\u2019ve only taken the first comp sci class, java 1) and even though the hackathon says no experience required, I still think it might not be worth it for me to go. I\u2019d hate to be the burden on a group because I can\u2019t contribute anything to the project\n\nWhat does everyone think?",

            "comment": "I felt the same way about my first hackathon. Once I went, I realized that hackathons aren\u2019t all about the projects. While I would encourage you to attempt one, there are other things on a hackathon\u2019s itinerary that are invaluable to first-timers.\n\nThe workshops and tech talks will help expose you to new ideas and technologies, and the leisure activities make it a great environment to unwind and meet new people. Just showing up and being present will be worth it, I promise.\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry about being a burden to a potential project group. Most people are welcoming no matter what your experience level. Plus you\u2019re definitely not the only first-timer. You can find people at your experience level to group up with too. Just give it your best shot regardless!",

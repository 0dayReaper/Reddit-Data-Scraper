If I don\u2019t take this class now I will be pushed back a year because it\u2019s a pre rec for a class I have to take this fall for another class that\u2019s only offered in the spring (complicated I know).\n\nTLDR:\n\nI\u2019m not too worried about it yet but my question is if the class gets canceled (worst case scenario), can I get put into another class for the credit even though the rest are full online? \n\nI paid for the course",

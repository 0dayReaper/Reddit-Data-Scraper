If so, you can use [https://mobileprint.gsu.edu/](https://mobileprint.gsu.edu/)  to  upload and print directly from there - pay attention to what printer you choose and ask at the library desk if you're not sure! \n\nIf you're not a current student/faculty/staff, you'll need to buy a visitor print card (card costs $1, you need to put a minimum of $1 on the card, cash only, no change given.",

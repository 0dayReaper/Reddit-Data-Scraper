    "postText": "So this happened to me in one of my psych classes and I don\u2019t know if that professor is sick or resigned but she hasn\u2019t made an announcement since late March and hasn\u2019t updated grades since then as well. I don\u2019t know if I should be worried or not but I turned in all my assignments for the class but don\u2019t know what else to do like should I report it and if so, who do I report it to? I\u2019m really lost because I don\u2019t want this to affect my grades.\n\nUpdate: Thank you so much guys, after reaching out to the psych head of department, My professor finally made an announcement",

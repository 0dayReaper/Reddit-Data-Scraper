            "comment": "Hey y\u2019all,\n\nSo my partner and I have his class and from what we\u2019ve heard - it\u2019s a massive misunderstanding. The trip abroad wasn\u2019t doomed by poor planning or his negligence, it was ruined by the fact that France decided that that week, specifically, was the week to wreak havoc. Are you gonna blame Bell for Macron\u2019s decision to raise the age of retirement + the rising level of protests? Sure, it was bad timing and I\u2019m sure there were ways to recuperate the trip or fix things in a better manner, but I\u2019m sure a lot of people would have buckled under that stress too. \n\nAlso, as for the sexual misconduct - from what we\u2019ve heard, it involved Bell being seen in public with said student alone - along with some other stuff about him meeting with her privately on a regular basis (I believe to discuss academics or something of the sort). As far as I know - the one\u2019s making the accusation aren\u2019t involved with the student herself either. I\u2019d have to conjecture that it\u2019s something to do with the other students taking anger/frustration out due to the failed trip. Of course, this is all word of mouth, but there\u2019s no evidence that anything of the sort was happening. That\u2019s my take on all of this - I take this stuff really seriously (many of friends and even my partner have been victims of this kind of stuff), but I genuinely don\u2019t believe this to be a serious allegation.",

I have been asked by organizers to direct your inquiries to Molly Basset (Religious Studies Department Chair), Monique Moultrie (Director of Undergraduate Studies), or Sarah Rosen (Dean of College of Arts and Sciences). Their contact information can be found publicly on GSU websites. Please ask them to account for the situation at hand and demand they take responsibility. 30 GSU students were made to experience serious trauma during a misorganized and misconducted study abroad course in France over spring break. Investigations are alleged to be underway, but no action is being taken. Thank you for you concern and for your help!\"",

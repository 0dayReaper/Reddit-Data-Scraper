    "postText": "Hey guys! I was just wondering if anyone who took BIOL 3810 over the summer (in person) could attest to whether the class frequently goes over time? I've noticed it does pretty often during the school year, but because it's longer over the summer, I just wanted to see if anyone who has taken it before had some insight! Thank you!",

            "comment": "Different class, but I had a professor who would go over every class, sometimes by 15-20 minutes if you let him.\n\nThat class was in Aderhold, my next class that started 15 minutes after was in Petit. I had to talk to my next professor about if I were ever late, this was the reason. Thankfully, he understood.\n\nAfter a while I just started leaving the first class on time regardless of the professor. What made it awkward was that I was sitting in the front row closest to where he stood to lecture.\n\nI was super psyched for that class when I signed up, but it ended up being a pretty big letdown.",

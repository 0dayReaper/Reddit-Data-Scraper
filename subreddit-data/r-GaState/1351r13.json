I have no idea how she\u2019s gonna grade all this by tmrw since I think thats when grades are due. \n\nAlso, is this a valid reason to appeal a grade or will I look stupid?",

If that's the case, the appropriate steps would be to have a conversation with your instructor, and if that doesn't resolve it, talk to the department chair.  The next step after that is the Dean. Appeals are a *last resort*",

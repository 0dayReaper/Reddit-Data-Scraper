    "postText": "Are there any current IB, PE, or AM analysts (or above) and former GSU students that have received any jobs in these fields? I have a slight chip on my shoulder as those industries are highly selective, and it feels like if you did not go to an Ivy (or other top schools) and don\u2019t have a 4.0, you\u2019re out of luck. I\u2019m finishing up in December and want to see what/who is out there. \n\nI\u2019m interested in people who made it to significant finance hubs (NYC, SF, LA, &amp; MP) as well as ATL.",

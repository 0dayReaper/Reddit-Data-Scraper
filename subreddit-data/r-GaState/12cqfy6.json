    "postText": "So I kinda screwed up for my biology 2 class because I missed four quizzes. The reason being I literally just forgot all about them and I can't retake and there's no way in hell the prof is gonna reopen them for me \ud83d\ude02 so in case I do fail this class, how would the repeat to replace thing work? Do I just apply to the class again and the new grade in the course changes? Does it have to be the same professor or can I choose a different one?",

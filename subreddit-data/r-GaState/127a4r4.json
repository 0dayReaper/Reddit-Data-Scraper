We didn't really have homework, but in class we did 'learning team assignments' where we worked in assigned groups, which fortunate for me I had great classmates but I know some didn't and had to tell the professor, and he did listen to their concerns! The exams were more like quizzes and taken at home in icollege, and notes were allowed. \n\nWhen I was taking the class there was also a virtual exchange component where we got to work with students from Hong Kong on a project, which was kind of stressful but as long as you're organized, you'll be fine.",

College isn't a scam it's the nickel and dining which is the issue. Gsu is at least better than other school but if I'm not going to the gym I don't want to pay for you guys who are.",

The general idea was that by cutting the taxes of the rich, the rich would then reinvest that money into their business/personnel.  The theory would propose that by cutting the taxes of the wealthy, the said entity would then spend that money on a quality construction company, instead of just pocketing the cash.  Costs are not supposed to trickle down, but rather the wealth.  \n\nI do enjoy the visual sentiment of the \"trickle-down\" and \"burst pipe\" though.",

It's def more than you'd spend on groceries over an academic year, but the food is pretty high quality.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone; I will share how I picked the easiest classes throughout my time at GSU. I am in my last semester and averaged a 3.9 Overall GPA.\n\nA pre-requisite to this post. **The more time you spend before signing up, the less time you will spend in the semester.** So do put in the effort to get your best schedule made. Look up your classes before your sign-up date and have all your CRNs copied and ready to instant submit when you can sign up. (If there is a super limited class, sign up for that first and submit, do not waste time entering them all if there are low spots) As well as an alternative for each one.\n\n**Online classes are a must.**\n\nOnline classes are always easier, even if the professor is \"harder.\" Online classes are black and white, due dates for the entire semester are already scheduled, and there is little fluctuation between the weeks unless projects are due at different times. On top of that, all of the content you are learning and **any HW you do will have been posted online before**. Professors who make their own content are rarer than people think. So you can use that to study to your best advantage.\n\nUsing a schedule like [this](https://www.tiktok.com/@olivia.mangano/video/7005372143366098182) for all your classes will keep you in the lock and break down all your assignments piece by piece and not be overwhelmed.\n\n**Rate My Professor**\n\nRate My Professor can be overrated or not up-to-date. RMP depends on one student's experience with the professor. Think of them as a hotel or food review. More often than not, people with a bad experience with a professor are more likely to write a review than someone who just did \"okay\" or did not find it hard. While you should look at each one because it can have useful information, there is a better way to find what professor to take.\n\n**IPORT IPORT IPORT IPORT IPORT**\n\n[IPORT](https://dssapex.gsu.edu/pls/apex/f?p=140:1::::NO) is the best way to find classes overall. It shows you by prefix, by course, and by professor the grade distribution of each one. **Do you want to know if a certain class is harder than others so your schedule is not jam-packed with harder courses**? Well, just view the grade distribution of the course.\n\n**So you decided what course you need to take but now need to view which professor to take?** Use IPORT and view the past 3 years of professors who taught that class and what the class average was, and what the A vs. B ratio was. If you see a class with 15 A's, 30 B's, and 5 C's. Even if the RMP says the professor is hard, you have concrete proof that it really is not that difficult. And an \"average\" student will get a B.\n\nIPORT has the history of all the classes and professors and how well the students did in their classes. Use that information to find the best professors for your advantage. Do not make college harder than it should be.\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know in the comments! Hopefully, this helps.  \n\n\n*P.S. You are going to see that usually, the best professors are reserved for the honors college, and the online classes are reserved for MBA students. But as a normal student, there are still plenty of options. Do not be discouraged.*",

RateMyProfessors has been helpful regarding which classes are most likely to guarantee the highest grades, but not professor competence. I have not looked into IPORT. I am not in the Honors college, so I cannot comment on the quality of professors there.\n\nI am a rising senior with a 4.17 GPA.",

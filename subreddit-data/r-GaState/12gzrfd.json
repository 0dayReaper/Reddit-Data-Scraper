    "postText": "For 2023-2024 aid year it says I need required documents on paws. But when I click the verify my fafsa button it takes me to a different page and it says I\u2019m all caught up right now in the needs action tab. So I\u2019m not sure what exactly I need to upload?\n\nEdit: Looks like after this semester is done, I will have 126 hours attempted. So I\u2019m pretty much out of hope scholarship. I still need 20 credit hours to graduate.",

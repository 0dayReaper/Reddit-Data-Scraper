I was able to spend the day working/job searching. It does seem like you are leaning more towards cybersecurity and I do think that you should do what your heart tells you to do albeit hard :) \n\nI recommend starting that job search now and submitting applications to roles that you find interesting. It doesn't matter if you don't fit the requirements -- sometimes a company/team will like you enough to hire you on. I also recommend reaching out to your network to see if anyone knows of any open positions. You can also look on LinkedIn for people in the field you want to get into and talk to them about their experience and for any advice (also do this for recruiters)!\n\nI do want to let you know, that to apply for an internship you have to still be pursuing a degree. Most places won't consider you if you already have your degree and instead you should focus on full time opportunities :)",

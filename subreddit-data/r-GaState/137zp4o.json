    "postText": "So I took this last semester off and have decided to change my major as I\u2019m returning in the fall.  I\u2019ve already changed my major once from Neuroscience to Studio Art (Graphic Design), but the time off allowed me to think about what I really want to do, and I would like to change my major to biology. I have already taken some of the required classes when I was a Neuro major during freshman year. I spent the past year and a half only taking design and art classes, so I wonder if it will take me longer to graduate since I now have to take the rest of the required classes for biology. My question is, would there be any downsides to changing my major again this late? If anyone has had experience changing majors multiple times, I would appreciate your input. I\u2019ve scheduled an appointment with my advisor to talk about changing it, so if you have any suggestions for questions I can ask, feel free to let me know.  Thanks for reading!",

            "comment": "In PAWS there is a What If tab in your academic evaluation that allows you to see what you\u2019d have to do if you changed or added a major/minor. It will take into account all the classes you\u2019ve already taken.\n\nI changed majors a few times. First it was physics, then psychology, then neuroscience with a psych minor, then finally double majoring in neuroscience and psychology.\n\nBeing a junior still gives you time to catch up, especially if you take advantage of Maymesters and summer semesters, but I know not everyone wants or is able to do that. Plus, plenty of people take a little longer than the traditional four years to finish up.\n\nThe biggest question would be why you want to change from graphic design to biology.",

I\u2019ve always loved and been fascinated in aquatic animals and aquarium keeping (it\u2019s a topic I research heavily and often), and I also have an interest in biology and physiology in general.

There are also internship opportunities at the Georgia Aquarium, which is a plus and something I\u2019ve looked into.

Make sure you pay attention to pre-requisites when you do this. \n\nYour advisor can guide you, but I would really not rely on them as they have minimal skin in the game if your plans don\u2019t work out. \n\nYour design/art classes can hopefully be used to fulfill some elective requirements, and you can also see if you\u2019re able to use them towards a minor - if you\u2019re interested in that of course.",

Others, like biology or psychology, are more like stepping stones. I changed my major once, and when I was trying to decide what to switch to, my uncle (who\u2019s a career counselor) told me that sometimes what you like to learn about doesn\u2019t actually match up with what you want to DO. If not for that conversation, I probably wouldn\u2019t have found my dream career and taken the necessary steps to get there. So before you switch, think about what you want to DO and what you can do NOW to get there. Maybe it means switching majors, maybe it doesn\u2019t. If you\u2019re thinking about doing some kind of health profession degree, a lot of those degrees (med school, OT school, etc.) don\u2019t care what your major is as long as you have good grades in the prerequisites, have related experience, and otherwise show interest in and dedication to pursuing that career. Just some thoughts!",

I just spent TONS of time in the math help room (not sure if GSU has this tho, I took these classes at U of SC).

The thing is unless you are going for a bio degree its worthless unless your are staying in for the PhD route  (I was a bio major )  getting my master's atm but was  job applying till I got accepted to my program  was annoying because it's shit pay and long hours of lab work. As you are switching a second time it comes down to when do you want to begin your life ?  How long do you plan to stay in school ? Do you plan to pursue a secondary degree ?  How financially stable are you ?  You are losing money every year you don't graduate which makes starting life a lot weirder just saying.",

It\u2019s a bit overwhelming (obviously), and as a first generation student I\u2019m not sure what/where/when to get help. Does anyone know any campus resources that allow for help either in person or virtually ? TIA",

Even though the law library is mostly for law students, I'd bet they have some resources or can at least point you in the right direction.\n\nThe good news is that you have lots of time! If all you did was self-study and do a lot of practice tests between now and then, I'd think you'd be in pretty good shape.",

    "postText": "I'm majoring in public health and this course counts as an elective for the public health program. I have no experience with GIS but I've always wanted to learn how to use it. I looked into [IPORT](https://dssapex.gsu.edu/pls/apex/f?p=140:1::::NO) for the grade distribution and it looks like a lot of people got A's but also C's. The course hasn't been offered in a couple of years but will be offered in Fall 2023. I'm curious as to why people got C's and if its something that I should be concerned about. I've never had this professor either and I don't see anything on ratemyprofessors.",

There are also some \u2018gotcha\u2019 questions thrown in and that combination is rough. \n\nHowever, the stuff he covers is really valuable, especially if you\u2019re trying to do spatial research.",

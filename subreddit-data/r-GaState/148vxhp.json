I figured it would be a good idea to put a thread here in case if anyone wanted to chat about the event that occurred at T-Deck earlier today. Thoughts and Prayers to the victims family can be left here, or if there is any information (no personal info about the victim) about what occurred. Also a place to digest the information too.",

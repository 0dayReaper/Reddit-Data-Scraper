FI 3300 classes are structured very similarly, no matter the professor: problem sets (homework questions) to be completed every other couple of weeks, and two exams + the final. His class isn't difficult nor easy, but he's dedicated to helping students better understand the material -- I attended his office hours, and he was super helpful!",

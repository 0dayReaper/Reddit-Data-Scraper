    "postText": "EDIT: Title should be \"FI 3300 Corporate Finance Review\"\n\nAs a business major, FI 3300 is a required course. Coming from scoring 100% on every Accounting 2 exam, I was not afraid, but I was not entirely sure what to expect either, since I heard that the course was both easy and difficult for other students. A friend of mine from the previous semester scored a 100% on every corporate finance exam with Professor Meng Wang, so I selected Meng Wang as my professor.\n\nTeaching: I enjoyed his teaching for the most part and was able to almost entirely forego reading the textbook by writing down the formulas and a few definitions he provided in class. Some things were undecided at the beginning of the semester, such as whether the pretest or knowledge checks would be graded, but these were resolved smoothly. I will refer to this one more time in the final exam section, but I give the professor an A grade, or 95%, for teaching overall.\n\nCaspian Sea Textbook: There are these \"stories\" for each chapter that were a complete waste of time for me and I honestly have no idea why they are in the textbook. The textbook should have just been formatted as a normal textbook, in my opinion. I give the textbook a B grade, or 85% since there are useful resources for more difficult CSEPUB questions.\n\nCSEPUB Graded Assignments: For a few chapters, there were CSEPUB questions that were significantly more difficult than the base material taught in class, and would \"require\" looking at the textbook for guidance. I do not particularly see this as a problem though since you are \"supposed\" to read the textbook anyway. After the first week, for each graded CSEPUB question, I would do the practice version first to ensure I knew what I was doing. My average CSEPUB graded assignment score (excluding mock midterm and final) was 99.13%. I give the graded CSEPUB assignments an A+ grade or 100%.\n\nMock Midterms: these essentially combine questions from the corresponding CSEPUB practice/graded assignments, but are significantly more difficult than the actual midterms. I scored a 98.25% on Mock Midterm 1 and 98.75% on Mock Midterm 2. I give the Mock Midterms an A+ grade or 100%.\n\nMidterms: For studying for the first midterm, I took the first mock midterm the afternoon before the exam. For studying for the second midterm, I redid all the corresponding graded CSEPUB assignments the night before the exam and then took the second mock midterm the afternoon before the exam. In my opinion, the difficulty level of midterms 1 and 2 was significantly lower than it should have been. I scored a 100% on both in 15 minutes or less, but I felt the second midterm was slightly more challenging. I give the midterms a B- grade, or 80%.\n\nCSEPUB Mock Final: this was similar to the mock midterms. I scored a 98.63%, but give it an A+ or 100%.\n\nFinal: 29% of students scored a 95% or above in midterm one and 18% did in midterm two. I felt that the difficulty was substantially spiked compared to the midterms to achieve the grade distribution stated in class. I studied for this exam by redoing all of the CSEPUB graded assignments the night before the exam and taking the mock final right after. I was 99% sure I would score a 100% going in but was surprised by the difficulty level. For one, there were challenging conceptual questions on this exam that were completely absent on the midterm exams. Of the forty questions, there were three I had issues with. The question that asked us to calculate the current ratio did not have a correct answer in the answer sheet when including accruals in the calculation of current liabilities, even though, the textbook, states that accruals are part of current liabilities (the main reason I gave the professor an A grade instead of A+). Only by removing accruals from my calculation was I able to get a number that matched one of the answer choices, so I selected that. The second question I had an issue with was one that asked us to calculate NPV but none of the answer choices were exact answers. I chose the one closest to what I got with my calculator, but this was still off by a second significant figure. The final question I had an issue with was a question that asked which statement was \"correct,\" but the \"correct\" choice was labeled incorrectly on the professor's answer key and might not have been addressed had I not checked this with him afterward. I scored a 100% on the final, but I personally deduct a point for the current ratio question, half a point for the NPV question, and one-quarter of a point for the question I had to get resolved on the answer key, for a grade of 38.25/40, 95.6%, or an A. This exam was of appropriate difficulty, but the few issues I brought up prevented the exam from being an A+ in my eyes.\n\nMy Final Grade: A+ or 99.86%\n\nFinal Review Grade: A or (95%+85%+100%+100%+80%+100%+95.6%)/7 = 93.6%",

I had a lot of anxiety going into the final because of the horror stories that are spread around with this class. I got a 100 on both midterms. Still waiting on my final grade but I believe I only missed one. Great write up.",

As someone who has no interest in finance, but nonetheless still required to take this course, I'm a little less worried about this class after reading your review. It seems as long as I study, practice, and consult the textbook, things should be okay.  \n\n\nHow much was the final exam worth of your final grade?",

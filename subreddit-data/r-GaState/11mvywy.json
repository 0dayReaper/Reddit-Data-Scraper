    "postText": "I\u2019m a freshman and I intend on taking summer courses to get some of my requirements out of the way. \n\nRight now my schedule is:\nGlobal Issues, \nMedia, Culture, and Society, and \nPers 2001\n\nHow does this schedule look? Should I drop a class and only take two (need at least 6 credits for financial aid) or keep as is?\nI\u2019m considering switching out of Global Issues for either another Area E, online Spanish, or Intro to Psych since I\u2019ve heard the course load can be heavy even during a full semester.",

            "comment": "I'm not sure about the other three classes, but I'm taking global issues rn with Patrick Munger. I don't study at all, and I got a 90 something on the first exam. He gives a study guide and the answers in the class meeting before exams. Homework is really Quizlet or multiple attempts if you take a note of the correct answers (it asks the same questions) and then exit out of the tab before the grade saves. Map quizzes just require quick googling. Very easy class.",

I'm considering doing Spanish too (if I do, I'll let you know), I think it's a simple class but not a huge sleeper.

Multiple choice, and then two written responses and I think a bonus. Don't be afraid of it, really. The study guide is basically gonna be your answer key. If you can memorize vocabulary and apply them onto examples, you'll be fine. And then you just need to know how those examples interact. If you'd like to see my exam, I think I can ask for it back (I missed the next class, so I didn't pick it up)",

With Pers 2001, I'm taking it online, and all I have to do is do some quizzes which are unlimited attempts. They only have 2-3 questions at most. Do some weekly discussion posts based on his videos, and that's it for Pers 2001. I had Cheshier for media, culture, and society (in person), so all of our tests were open-book. Although the class was a bit challenging since it cover a lot of info, however, he was very very kind to give us lots of extra credit to bump up our grades. For that class, we didn't have assignments (like quizzes or homework) so our test grades affected us the most. I haven't taken global issues so I can't say anything about it : (",

I can't remember how much it was, but it was around $75, and unfortunately, you cannot find the free version online. Each chapter is short, as its around 5-6 pages at most. And the test usually consists of like 4-5 chapters or so. Tests were all online for us, and we get like 3 days to do it however, it is a one-attempt kind of test. In class, we would discuss/summarise the chapters in the book, so if you pay attention well in the lecture, you'll prob do great on the tests.",

Durant uses a free online textbook and her quizzes are usually one question where your answer is mostly an opinion. The midterm was to listen to the radio for 30 min and describe what you hear. Quizzes for both classes is open note.",

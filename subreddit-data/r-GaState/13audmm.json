Side walks are too crowded to bike on downtown and there are only a couple of bike lanes so you need to be able to bike with cars and the drivers are not good. Don't even bother trying to bike on Cortland the traffic just moves too fast.",

The ones at Aderhold are also in a good spot, but not covered. \n\nMake sure you get a u-lock and use it religiously.\n\nPlay with Strava/Ride with GPS/Apple Maps (yea, Apple Maps) to get an idea about routes to and from campus and try a few out.",

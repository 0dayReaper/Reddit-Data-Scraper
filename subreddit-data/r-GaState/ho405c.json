If there was ever a professor who would actually work to try and pull this off (not his call, needs dept chair and dean approval most likely) Prof Fix is it.  I would love to hear his candid thoughts on today's SCOTUS rulings especially McGrit v Oklahoma.",

That's the normal rule which is acceptable but there should be exempts due to Corona. Plus if Georgia has a spike in cases and GSU decides to move to fully Online due to safety concern they will have to self deport themselves within 10 days or be put into deportation camps. I have no idea what the current department is doing. Let's all hope this changes.",

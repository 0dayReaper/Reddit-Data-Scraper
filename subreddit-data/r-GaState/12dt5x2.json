            "comment": "Mgt 3400 is singlehandedly the most stressful class I have took during my whole degree program due to the fact that all  the major graded components is a group project where you interview someone in a management position and write a paper+end of term presentation. It may be a different setup for minimester classes, but it comes down to sheer luck if you end up in a group with people that aren't lazy as hell or extremely difficult to work with.",

These are some of the hardest courses the university has to offer, which means you want 14 weeks to do them - not only 7.\n\nIf you take them in the summer without reaching out to an academic advisor for insight you may really be tanking your gpa in a single semester.",

I got an A in both Orgo 2 and Molecular Cell Biology and just decided to take the labs during the summer to get them over with. And with Calc it\u2019s a night course and have a huge gap between classes to get work done.",

To this day, both the mathematics and chemistry departments advise these are not good courses to take over the summer. I understand you may not care what the department or advisors say, but felt you should know. Best of luck",

He genuinely cares about you learning the material. His tests are exactly like the study guide, but with different numbers; so as long as u do the study guides, I\u2019m sure you will be okay! :)",

That being said I felt that this lab was much easier than orgo I lab since there was less content and it primarily focuses on NMR and synthesis mechanisms you\u2019ve learned about in orgo II lecture. If you want to get a head start on preparing I would recommend reviewing carbonyl condensation reactions and how NMR works.",

However, for the math class that I was able to skip to get to calc 1, I did not get the credit for it. Which meant I had to take an additional math class (I chose calc 3). \n\nThe way my advisor explained it to me is that the math placement exam allowed me to skip ahead to a class without having to complete its prerequisite, but it did not give me the credit for the prerequisite that I skipped. Perhaps that's why OP will need to take the CLEP exam, as that will give credit.",

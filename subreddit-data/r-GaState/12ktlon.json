Between the weekly homework, videos and quizzes there\u2019s a lot to keep up with but he dropped the lowest test grade and bumped my grade at the end of the yr. If you try your best and show up to class you\u2019ll do fine. You should be comfortable with algebra and trigonometry, otherwise the math isn\u2019t that hard. The labs were all during class time and easy.",

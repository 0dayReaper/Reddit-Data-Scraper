    "postText": "I'm a freshman looking to transfer to UGA for Spring 2024, and at GSU there is a repeat-to-replace option where you can take a class again and completely replace the past grade. My question is, would UGA do the same and use only my newer grade when calculating my GPA, or would it average the two? Also, when repeating a class at GSU, does the old (replaced) grade get wiped from the transcript, or would UGA still be able to see it? Would really appreciate an answer, thanks",

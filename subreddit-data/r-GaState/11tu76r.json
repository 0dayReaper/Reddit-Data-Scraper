    "postText": "I am a student at the downtown ATL campus planning on registering for PHYS 2211(lecture section only) at the online perimeter campus this summer. There is no PHYS 2211L at the online perimeter, and the downtown ATL campus does not offer PHYS 2211L on its own but as a part of PHYS 2211K. If I take PHYS 2211(lecture section only) at the online perimeter, how can I take the PHYS 2211L component simultaneously or in the fall. BTW, my advisor says that I cannot take classes at two separate perimeter campuses simultaneously, so I cannot take the lecture component online and the lab component at another perimeter campus.",

You should ask your advisor to make sure, otherwise your only option is taking it at the downtown campus. Also im not sure what your major or future plans are, but keep mind that some schools do not accept prerequisites if they were taken online (only exception is during covid). I speak for dental school specifically though.",

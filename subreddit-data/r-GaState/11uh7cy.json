    "postText": "Throwaway here. I am wondering if anyone else got really sick after the summer semester they tore down Kell Hall? Specifically, things like muscle spasms, gastro issues, blurry vision, fatigue, confusion, overgrowth of candida, or anything abnormal.\n\nSince that semester, my health has steadily deteriorated. Recently, I was given an antifungal medication for fungal infections that have popped up all over my body. Once I took the medication, all the symptoms disappeared. The only thing I can think of is Kell Hall and how bad it was on my lungs at the time. \n\nI've never experienced anything like this before. Nor do I know someone who has. If anyone else has had a similar experience, please DM me with your story and what you have done to recover.",

Currently, I've taken out sugars and have been eating yogurt as directed by my doctor. \n\nThat and I increased fiber intake two years back due to a chronic fissure that wouldn't heal. To be honest, fiber has been a temperamental on its own. Adding yogurt and probiotics has really boosted its potency. \n\nI will definitely look into a nutritionist. Thank you for the suggestion.",

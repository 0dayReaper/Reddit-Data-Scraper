Occasionally a car break in, someone making harassing phone calls, or the like.\n\nOf the two biggest, I'd say Dunwoody appears on it marginally less than Clarkston. But that's a \"Clarkston was on it three times in a month and Dunwoody twice\" kind of difference. \n\nI can't remember when I last saw Alpharetta, Decatur, or Newton on it.",

There was also a Clarkston one May 5 (email arrived May 8) for an entering auto report.\n\nThere was a report for larceny at the Decatur Campus between April 21 and April 25 (reported April 25)\n\nDunwoody last appeared with a larceny reported March 30.\n\nBear in mind, these are just things that go through the GSU PD.  If your question is more about the areas surrounding the campus, I'd suggest things like googling \"crime map 30021\" which will give you an idea of the areas around the campuses (that one is the zip for Clarkston).",

    "postText": "So I have a 2.90 HOPE GPA and I'm aware that I have to have a 3.0 GPA or above in order to keep it, however, I have also read that they check it every 30, 60, 90 credit hours to renew? Would that mean that I have to have a 3.0 per 30, 60, 90 cred hours or do I have to wait until I complete one of those three to renew my scholarship? I'm first gen and the only one to ever get a scholarship so this is still fairly new to me, please help T-T",

However if you are currently OVER 90 credit hours there is no other checkpoint and even if you get a higher GPA you will not be able to regain the scholarship.",

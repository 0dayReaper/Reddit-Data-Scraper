Are we now at the 60% point where I won\u2019t have to repay my financial aid? Bc that would be seriously impossible for me. I can\u2019t afford it. For context all my classes are online, I received the zell miller scholarship and federal loans. I\u2019ve been pushing myself to finish but this week I just broke. I have to emergency withdraw.",

            "comment": "Emergency withdrawals are different. If you\u2019re having a serious health problem, an emergency, which involve some thing that you had no idea was going to happen after February 28, you can go to the dean of students website and fill out the emergency withdrawal application.\n\nAn emergency withdrawal is granted in situation where you had serious health or life altering emergencies that happened after the midpoint and you had no control over. The emergency withdrawal is not going to require you to pay back financial aid that you received this year. If you are granted, an emergency withdrawal, that means that Georgia state acknowledges that you had an emergency outside of your control and will grant you leniency and give you W\u2019s for every class that you were enrolled in this semester. You will not have to pay money back for this semester, but you also will get W\u2019s for all of your classes this semester, which will not negatively impact your GPA if you are granted the emergency withdrawal. \n\nSounds like you need to go on the dean of students website, click the emergency withdrawal button, and then click the start application button. It can take a couple of weeks to hear back about your emergency withdrawal, so be a little patient. \n\nBest of luck, hope next semester won\u2019t be as tough on you as this semester was.",

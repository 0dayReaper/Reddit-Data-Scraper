    "postText": "I\u2019ve been at GSU for a little bit. I have juggled a lot of personal issues that have interfered with my academic progress. However, my last semester that I took left me disappointed with the school as a whole. My professors were less than helpful and it\u2019s tiring having to deal with the repercussions of I\u2019ve been thinking about transferring but I feel like it\u2019s also possible for me to remain optimistic and not worry about one (or two) bad semesters. I\u2019m just looking for different perspectives and seeing if anyone can relate a little bit.",

            "comment": "This school is good for connections but when you have something like that happen (I speak from experience) the school pretty much makes things extremely hard for you both in the academic advising departments and the professors. I will forever detest the math department here for pushing me out of my original degree after I had legitimate reasons (that the emergency withdrawal people found to be legit at literally first glance) as to why I couldn't pass calc in which if I had another attempt i could have done. However in getting to where I am now I met some great professors that I connect with and that are compassionate. Honestly just seek out and use the programs they have here to get you connections and the knowledge you want to get where you are. Some areas here are a shitshow but other areas are great and will advance you quite quickly. I hope you can get back on your feet and choose the right choice for you.",

I\u2019m doing better now. Downtown atlanta isn\u2019t for everyone, especially now with the violence and food desert.",

However, I don\u2019t think that transferring to a different university would really change much. Universities operate similarly no matter where you go. Your GPA will follow you wherever and the workload/challenges that come with college will follow you wherever. I just think it\u2019s important to learn the system and find the proper resources. Keep your head up and strive to do better next semester.",

I feel like I could email them today with a question and they\u2019d still be happy to answer.\n\nLike everyone, I did have some bad professors. Thankfully, most of them weren\u2019t in my program so I didn\u2019t have to deal with them outside of a class or two.",

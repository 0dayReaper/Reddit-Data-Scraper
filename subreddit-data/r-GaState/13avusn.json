I was thinking of riding my bike to the MARTA station and just parking my bike at school while I\u2019m in class. \n\nHowever I\u2019m worried my bike may get stolen or have its wheels taken so is there anywhere safe where you all have had luck?",

            "comment": "I would recommend parking your bike along the Greenway, specifically next to the stairway which connects the Greenway to the elevated plaza between Langdale and the Library. The constant foot traffic is a deterrent to theft, and there are fewer homeless and thieves in that area as there's no question it's \"on campus\". I have never seen missing wheels at this location, nor have I heard about any bike theft at this spot. [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/Ay7zTiwPiTpya3yd8).\n\nParking *inside* of the fare gates at a MARTA station *away* from Downtown, you'll probably have a 75% chance of *not* having your bike (or its wheels) stolen. *Outside* of the fare gates -- 50%.\n\nParking *inside* of the fare gates at a MARTA station *in* Downtown (such as Five Points), you'll probably have a 50% chance of *not* having your bike (or its wheels) stolen. *Outside* of the fare gates or anywhere else in Downtown -- 25%.",

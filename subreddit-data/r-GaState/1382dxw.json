    "postText": "Hey! How is everyone?\n\nI am a computer science major that transferred from a very small college that didn't have a lot of resources.\n\nI feel as if I am not getting the full use out of what's available to me. I mean, I only recently found out about the amazing gym on campus.\n\nI could really use some help as far as navigating my college career and my pathway as well as understanding all the benefits and resources available to me. \n\nI have also run into several issues and could really use some assistance.\n\nIs anybody able to help?\n\nIf not, who can? My advisor isn't very helpful and he's EXTREMELY hard to get in touch with.\n\nI would love to speak to classmates or alumni and get some tips and better understanding.\n\nHope everyone is having a great summer!",

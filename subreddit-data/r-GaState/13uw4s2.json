I took it freshman year and skipped a third of the lectures and still got an A. Just stick to the readings above all, you\u2019re bound to have quiz/exam questions on it.",

There was a whole section I genuinely didn\u2019t go to class for or study because I already knew about that topic and I did the assignments so fast. \n\nSo yeah, if you truly don\u2019t know anything about anything then it\u2019s easy but you will have to know. But if you know deep or basic knowledge on some topics you can get by on your general knowledge and common sense. I had a different professor but a good chunk of the information was kinda just common sense mixed with general knowledge and learned knowledge. But common sense in the way that you\u2019d be able to narrow down an answer. Like you wouldn\u2019t put something about Vladimir Putin in relation to a question about military leaders in World War 1 or 2 or who was the leader of Russia when the Berlin Wall was around . He wasn\u2019t born or a kid so it doesn\u2019t make sense. I had lots of questions like that in the class where it was knowledge you should learn but also common sense that you should know something wouldn\u2019t make sense",

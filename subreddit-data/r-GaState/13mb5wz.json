            "comment": "Because of the backend system used to process financial aid, at the end of every term the financial aid office has to manually review your grades to ensure you met the terms of your academic plan that you set up when you first got your SAP appeal approved. As long as you did they'll complete their review and apply your aid soon. If not, submit a panther answer ticket and they should review it.",

Schools often originate Pell in big batches, and are normally pretty bad about cancelling originations for students who didn't show up (if they do it at all it normally won't be until at least after the add/drop period ends at their school). \n\nThe magic words you may need to use with the other schools is asking them to cancel your Pell origination for summer. You can say that GSU told you \"COD\" still shows a summer origination at other schools and therefore can't pay out your Pell grant. They should successfully convey the correct message to the other school's fin aid office.",

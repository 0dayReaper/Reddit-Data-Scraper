I didn\u2019t have any reading assignments. There were 5 required two paragraph discussion post on your chosen films that you selected from the curriculum. These discussion posts weren\u2019t very challenging. We also had I believe it was 5 writing assignments. One of the papers was a bibliography, so you just needed sources in mla format, and she gave us an extension on it. I would definitely recommend taking this class with Mrs.Smith if you could.",

She was very sweet and didn\u2019t have hard set deadlines for our assignments. Her only requirement was that we have everything turned in by the semester deadline date. She also allowed you to resubmit assignments for a higher grade if you turned them in with enough time for her to provide feedback and you revise. I would say that this class does require a lot more of your time to be spent working on your assignments. We had 4 or 5 major projects I believe. We also would have in class writing assignments that she would use as attendance, but you could submit it at any time to her on i college. I definitely got more familiar with having to read and analyze academic scholarly sources that are over 20 pages of online reading. The major projects included an essay over art in the community, at least 5 minute video over your semester topic, annotated bibliography with an abstract, 5-6 page research argumentative essay, and a final revision project. I would highly suggest a calendar because it\u2019s easy to get behind with your other classes as well. My professor was Mrs. Murphy and I would definitely recommend her.",

The lectures were over the slides that he posted and he didn\u2019t take attendance. I personally went to a majority of the classes and ended off with an A. There was weekly reading assignments on top hat with usually at least 30 questions regarding the reading. There weren\u2019t any long written assignments for this class and all of the tests were multiple choice. I would say we had a test every 3 to 4 weeks.",

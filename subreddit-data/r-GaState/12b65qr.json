    "postText": "Hi, I wanted to register for a specific online class for this Fall, sadly it filled up before my registration time ticket began. \n\nI am simply wondering, is it possible that another one will end up being added, to allow for more people? Is it possible to request that this be done by emailing anyone? \n\nThanks, let me know if anyone has any experience with this!",

If that doesnt work then during the add/ drop period, make sure you check every time to see if someone\u2019s dropped out. You might get lucky",

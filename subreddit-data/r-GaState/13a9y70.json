They always do bc they have no idea how challenging life is outside of high school.\n\nA recognition of when you need to ask for help can be helpful. Asking the right person is important too - no student was able to graduate basing their decisions only on what other classmates say, so involve yourself with the program you\u2019re in and it\u2019s professors.\n\nTime management is biggest. Usually I see students who have failed because they didn\u2019t know how to study for all their classes, have a job, and have fun, and they prioritize school too low",

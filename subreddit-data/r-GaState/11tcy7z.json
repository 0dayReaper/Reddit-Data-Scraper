    "postText": "So I\u2019ve been looking through scholarship options for me, although my GPA is not so great which is around a 3.40, However most of the scholarships says that you have to be an Honors college student. I\u2019m not sure what that is but I know for sure that I\u2019m not one of those students. So I was wondering if there was anyone who has applied to scholarships and gotten them without being an honors college student and with a GPA below 3.5",

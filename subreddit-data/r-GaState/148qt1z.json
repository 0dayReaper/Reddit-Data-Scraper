Other students are probably feeling the exact same as you as summer semesters move very quickly",

I just had to show up to class and pay attention to ace quizzes (100% quiz grade average) and followed instructions on the vision document milestones and submit them ahead of time so I could get feedback before the deadline. For exams, I made sure to memorize the items on the study guide.",

    "postText": "So I'm a tutor for SEWA Americorps and we are in DESPERATE need for tutors who speak spanish who are availiable from either 4 to 7 or just 5:30-7:00 (preferrably 5:30-7) who can work with 7th grade (If you /any lower elementary grades? It's a monthly stipend of $1500 if you choose to stay for the whole 3 hours (Unsure how much you would be paid if you just choose 5:30-7 but we are in desperate need of someone who can speak spanish to work with higher level grades like middle school level). It's a service that lasts from Monday through Thursday (No negotiations unfortunately, I can't control that.) and on Saturdays, we have extracurriculars at apartments which is just playing games with the kids from 1 to 4 (Also non-negotiable, sorry I can't control that. If you don't have a car to get to the apartments, we usually carpool from a marta train station). \n\nThe co-members here are really nice and friendly and it doesn't matter what your major or previous work experience is, we're a very open minded service. As long as you enjoy working with students from the latino community who struggle in school because they can't ask their parents for help. If you're interested PLEASE message me and I'll give you my boss' email. I'm asking here because we're interested in GSU students since I'm a student and my friend who also works here also is a student here.",

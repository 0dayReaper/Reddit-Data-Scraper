I hate to say it, but this cat in the picture is merely a security profile. \n\nSo whilst I appreciate the image, I would encourage everyone to realize that it is below Aderholds Cat's glory to be photographed to much. We should remain content in having seen him once this semester, and respect his glorious mystery.",

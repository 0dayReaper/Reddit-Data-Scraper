The way I look at it is that the stuff you learn early in college is high school review/ general knowledge. You start to learn new material in junior year. Stuff you have never heard of. It\u2019s cool. I love the classes.",

If you don't have a genuine interest in the field and you're just in a degree program to get a diploma or a well paying job afterwards, but you don't care about the field itself, it might not be that fun. In my undergraduate degree I'd often here other students complain about classes and it always made me wonder, \"Why are you here then?\" because it seemed like they didn't actually like the field.",

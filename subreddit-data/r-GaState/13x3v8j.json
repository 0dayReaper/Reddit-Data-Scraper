Basically I\u2019m still working on getting loans/emergency funding and I know your classes can get dropped if you don\u2019t pay by a certain time but what about housing too? This will be my first time on campus so idk. Would they kick me out or something lol?",

There\u2019s a program at GSU called embark that can also help with housing. I hope everything gets sorted out for you! Feel free to DM me, I know that must be stressful.",

I\u2019m not sure if the grant can be used towards housing. You can also apply for the SAL loan which will put your payment deadline on hold. but I\u2019m not sure if it can go towards housing too, I only got it to pay off my tuition including my classes.",

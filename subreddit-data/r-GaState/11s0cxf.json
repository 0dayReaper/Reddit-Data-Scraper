If there are people who\u2019ve already completed it, do you think it helped more in the long run?\n\nI\u2019m currently debating whether to do my master\u2019s here or at Tech.",

What I mean by that is that materials basically overlap between 4xxx and 6xxx levels and the only distinction might be that you are asked to perform a task that is marginally more difficult relative to what an undergrad taking the same course might be asked do.\n\nIf you're in it for the the degree only and don't care about substance, the 4+1 program does save you a year. If you want to go into academia and actually be respectable, I'd suggest what the other guy has said - go to Tech.",

The private sector doesnt care.\n\nFor academia goals I'd suggest doing Georgia tech(in person).",

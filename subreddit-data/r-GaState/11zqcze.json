    "postText": "So I added this class thinking that it wasn't going to be too hard, cause so far none of my classes have been too challenging yet, however, this class really is kicking my ass, with the 1-2 weekly readings of 10-45 pages of some essay, including this thesis paper we have to start working on. I understand a decent chunk of the theory but I'm having a really hard time right now starting on the thesis paper, not knowing what to write about. I've asked the teacher for some help and he gave me some decent general advice, but not enough to really help me out.   \nIf anyone has taken this class before, or even right now, would yalls be able to help me talk this out/give some advice? Sometimes that's all I need really, and while gsu has free tutoring options, there aren't really any resources for film theory, so any help would be great",

GSU is better academically (named best undergraduate teaching, more rigorous) but a lot will depend on your degree. The biggest thing is deciding the type of campus you want and if you want to live downtown vs on a traditional campus (this may matter less if you\u2019re commuting- if you\u2019re commuting, I\u2019d say GSU since I saw somewhere you want to transfer to Tech).",

(I really did try to save for a car during my gap year but all the options i had didn\u2019t really work out) I just wanted to be a full time student and focus on my studies and not have to worry about working my first year. but idk what to do. and my family lives an hour away from the campus and i dont have friends yet xD I just wish I really had a supportive family tbh. and by the options it was: get a car but i pay for insurance when i was adamant I didn\u2019t want to work my first year cause i feel like it will affect my performance in school. the other was not to get a car, live on campus and just walk to classes. and just get picked up when needed.",

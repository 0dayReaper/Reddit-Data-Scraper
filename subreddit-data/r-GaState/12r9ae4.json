Practicing for an essay is different from practicing for a multiple choice exam in terms of taking and grading practice exams. If you have tips, tricks, and info about the CLEP college composition handwritten exam here at GSU, please share them. It will be greatly appreciated.",

You can Google essay prompts and pick them at random.\n\nRemember that ultimately you just need to write well and in an organized way within the time limit. Use a variety of sentence structures to show you have a command of written English. Use standard essay organization.\n\nEdit: also there is a clep subreddit with good info",

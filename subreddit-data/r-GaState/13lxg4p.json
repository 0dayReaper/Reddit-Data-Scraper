    "postText": "So I just got off the phone after waiting for 20-30 mins just to be told that I was a senior and needed to be sent to senior advising. I was originally in CIS when I came to GSU in the Fall of 2022 but switched to Physics to achieve the influence of my family wanting me to become an engineer at the time. I talked it out with them last night and it was okay that I was wanting to go back to CIS because I genuinely enjoyed the classes I took.   \nI am just waiting for the College Major form to go through with the Robinson College of Business to see if they will let me switch. Is that a high chance that they will let the change go through and is it bad that I decided to switch back? I felt like I wasted my time but honestly, my mental state was in the dumps Spring 2023. The Physics professor I had, kinda made it worst by not being the most helpful teacher when I asked for help. Has anyone had this type of problem or situation where you were 90 credits in and you realized that you didn't want to go down this path?",

They're not just sending you back and forth, even the website says you have to contact your senior advisor if you're past a certain number of hours. There's absolutely no reason that they would not let you do it. You can sign up for most classes without changing your major, so you don't _have_ to wait for the response from Robinson.",

I just realized last night after therapy that I was not made for physics and after last semester taking time to heal mentally. I slowly had to realize it. Im glad that I am not the only one changing majors like this!",

I personally would also never recommend listening to family on what major or career you should pursue. Engineer is not a fun ride, and if you are not really wanting to do it, it's torture",

They said that after I submit the form, should be around 1-2 business days til they get back to me! \n\nI thought when I started STEM at Clayton being influenced by my dad and uncle, I really did want to do it. But I just really enjoyed being creative and wiring things with cosplay, not really engineering ;w; Being in COVID and etc, I guess that kinda got to me til I finally had time outside the house and being my own person on campus and etc.",

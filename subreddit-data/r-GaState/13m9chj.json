    "postText": "I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, earlier this month I got my final grades and submitted a repeat to replace form. My gpa then was a 2.82 and my hope gpa was a 3.0, fast forward to last week as the RTR gets processed, my gpa rises to 3.19 and my hope gpa falls to 2.47 and I lose my hope for summer semester. I\u2019ve already set up an appointment with finaid but I wanted to ask to see if my case is unique or not and what a possible explanation would be.",

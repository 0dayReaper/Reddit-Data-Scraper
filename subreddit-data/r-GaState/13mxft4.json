            "comment": "If you haven't already, search up the transfer requirements. It'll give you a list of classes to take before you can transfer.\n\nFor CS, it's:\nEnglish 1 (ENGL 1101)\nEnglish 2 (ENGL 1102)\nCalculus 1 (MATH 2211)\nCalculus 2 (MATH 2212)\nPrinciples of Computer Science 1 (CSC 1301)\nLab Science Sequence (you'll have to take the first part and then the second part of a lab Science. EG: CHEM 1211K and CHEM 1212K)\n\nIf you've already done those or have ap/ib/clep credit for some of them, search up the college of computing website and see what courses every CS Major has to complete and what classes you can transfer. You could get your social science and humanitarian credits done. You could also get the PHYS 2211K requirement done too so you won't have to take it at GT. If you're past calc 2, try calc 3, linear algebra, discrete math, DE, Bridge, etc Also I think MATH 3020 and CSC 1302 still transfer in the upcoming fall/spring.\n\nAfter that, take a look at the threads. Pick out 2 that you'd like to try and see what classes you'll have to take if you choose both. Keep your options open, though. Chances are, you won't be able to take a lot of the classes GT requires for graduation, so keep your eyes open for any prerequisites you can transfer from GSU.\n\nWith all that said, good luck!\n\n\n\nLinks:\n\nGT CS Requirements)\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pnos0eol4cvswog/BSCS%20Core%20Requirements.pdf?dl=0\n\nGT CS Threads) (scroll down)\nhttps://www.cc.gatech.edu/threads-better-way-learn-computing\n\nGT CS Threads Graduation Requirements)\nhttps://catalog.gatech.edu/programs/computer-science-bs/#threadstext",

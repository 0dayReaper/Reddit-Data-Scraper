I just need to get adhd meds and the clinic I went to recently said they don\u2019t give adhd medication for adults. I just really need help before the summer semester starts.",

Trying to find a doctor or pill that will make your brain inherently function in a different way is not going to work out nor do good things to your self esteem. Throughout your process of finding a therapist and a psychiatrist I hope that you keep in mind trying to work around what's a hurdle *to you* and not simply trying to bring yourself to a place that your brain is not going to be.\n\nI also say this because, like you're finding out, the mental health industry is a fickle Beast that does not Aid often",

They take everyone, even homeless folks, and it\u2019s first come first served for ur initial appointment with them. \n\nYou can try GSU but the health clinic requires you have student insurance to take you. The counseling clinic can\u2019t prescribe medicine. \n\nIt\u2019s best to get on it asap as many clinics need you to schedule with them ahead of time to keep folks from just getting pills",

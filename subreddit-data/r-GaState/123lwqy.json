    "postText": "I took New Student Orientation unintentionally and I just learned that it doesn\u2019t count towards your degree. I\u2019m missing 1 credit from the Residency Requirement so I was wondering if I need to meet 30 credits within 1 year (2-3 semesters) or does it extend towards your future courses you register for? \n\nI\u2019m just worried it\u2019ll affect my HOPE status since I haven\u2019t completed 30 credits (I\u2019m a freshman so I don\u2019t know much about this\u2026)",

It just doesn\u2019t count towards the degree because it\u2019s an intro course to being in college and it boosts your GPA. It\u2019s not like a requirement for the degree, but HOPE paid for it, so it does count as a course taken in that regard.",

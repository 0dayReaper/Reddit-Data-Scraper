    "postText": "I\u2019m a senior graduating this week and I got an email last week that I need 4 more credits in area F. This is because my calculus 1 credit got applied to the pre calculus prerequisite and my calc 2 credit got applied to area d. But when i first started college I was able to skip pre calculus because I had high school AP Calc credit so shouldn\u2019t that be applied there? I contacted my advisor but she\u2019s out of town and I talked to another advisor and he said I should take the CLEP exam to get credit for pre calculus but he doesn\u2019t know how to access my AP scores and can\u2019t help me out. I don\u2019t know who else to contact about this, no one is picking up my calls and I don\u2019t know where to go in person. If anyone knows please help me out thanks!",

I barely had any people in my group, and it honestly felt kind of unfair having to create an entire project/working prototype from scratch.  \nI ended the class with an A, but I haven't talked with the other students since taking the class, nor do I think I found/maintained any valuable connections. You definitely have opportunities to connect with people in the relative field, since they bring some of them in during classes,",

We had to develop a business model, prototype, a pitch, and outside references for proper research studies in our project split between us three.\nOther groups had like 8-12 people. I\u2019m guessing we had the short end of the stick. You usually are supposed to only have one \u201crole\u201d kind of like an assembly line. It\u2019s a free grade as long as you try to be present in class and doing your part in the project.",

I talked a little bit regarding their prior experience, and some advice. Nothing else really stood out to me though.  Our group had four people starting; one guy dropped out. Other groups had like 8 people though. It felt really skewed, but maybe things have changed since then.",

            "comment": "As someone who took it as a first year, my perspective's probably more positive just because I was exposed to so much from both my classmates and the experience as a whole. If I'm being honest, while the weekly workshops and introductions to different people in tech was interesting, I didn't take away as much from those as I did from just talking to my classmates.\n\nJackie and Chad are awesome and very helpful, and the diversity of the class means that you get to talk and network from people who are in various stages of their lives. As someone who was still figuring out what to do, I learned a lot in terms of how to navigate my major, promoting myself and my accomplishments (LinkedIn), and even being more outgoing in terms of reaching out to people and looking for opportunities for myself. In that sense, I'd really recommend it in terms of being able to learn from your environment as long as your willing to put yourself out there. I consider myself a introvert, but being willing to go out of my way to try and talk to people and make connections was really beneficial and is something I'd highly recommend.\n\nGoing back to those workshops, while there are opportunities to connect with mentors from companies, it goes back to what I said in that previous paragraph about being willing to put yourself out there. There never gonna admonish you for asking questions, so I'd say the course is really good for getting an idea of what different industries and sectors of tech look like. Not every connection is gonna pay off, but it's a good avenue for learning and potentially gaining opportunities from.\n\nThe last thing I wanna touch on is the group work since it can be what makes or breaks the experience for you. I was blessed to have a good group dynamic where we each played to our individual strengths and were open with each other, but I understand that's not always going to be the case. As the other commenter said, your preset group will play a huge role in the impact you're able to have. A big thing I'd say is to be open to different perspectives and try to engage with everyone to the best of your ability. Things aren't always going to be perfect, but definitely try to make the best of it.\n\nI also understand how daunting it is creating an entire project from scratch, but it's also (I think) a good way to challenge yourself. My groups project was by no means perfect, but it was still something we were all excited for and willing to put effort into to the best of our ability. We did end up having to restart in terms of switching ideas once or twice, but were able to pace ourselves and still deliver a prototype. Scheduling for meetings and meeting timelines can be tough, but communication is the most important factor in keeping things moving along.\n\nHopefully that helps. Congrats on your acceptance!",

I still kind of feel bitter knowing we didn\u2019t get much help or guidance, and the other two had to balance their own priorities as third/fourth years while also contributing an amount of work equal to 6 people between the both of them",

            "comment": "What they're trying to build is great, but looking back on it, **I would not enroll in it again**. The **class lasted for 3 hours**. To provide a clear perspective, I've broken down my thoughts based on the type of students who should or should not enroll in this course.\n\n# Students who SHOULD NOT enroll:\n\n* You **already have work experience/internship experience** in your desired field (DON'T GO)\n* **You are mature** enough to work with and collaborate with a team on a project and don't need constant reminders of deadlines; you are already capable of starting and completing a project and have undertaken such tasks in a professional or pre-professional environments (DON'T GO)\n* You are someone who **already understands and readily uses Handshake, Linkedin, Indeed, GSU Career Services, etc.**, to find interesting internships in your desired field, and the job search/internship search is **NOT NEW** to you. (DON'T GO)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Lastly, ask yourself how serious and career-minded you are about pursuing this course; if you are **already very busy with other coursework**, do the class a favor and not enroll. This course is collaboration heavy, so when a student is not fully engaged and ready to be a constructive member, the entire experience is very hard on other students.\n\n# Students who SHOULD enroll:\n\n* If **you're first gen** and the first in your family to pursue more coveted or selective jobs that require hard and soft skills, then the Digital Leaders to Learners course is a great fit for you. (GO)\n* **You are a Freshman or just entering the first semester of Sophomore year,** similar to the point above. Basically, if you're new to internships/jobs/career readiness, then this course is for you. I think Freshmen and Sophomores will be able to gain a lot from this course because they have more time to take the skills learned in the course and apply them in all aspects of their life. However, a more experienced student may gain less from this course. (GO)\n* You are an upperclassman but still, **feel directionless, and all of your previous attempts to gain an internship/job have failed**. This course may help you figure out how to build a better resume/CV, be more professional in a work environment, and potentially increase your chances of success in the job market. With the weekly speakers, you will gain some great information on how to show up as the best version of yourself to land the job. However, GSU HAS A CAREER CENTER FOR THIS. Using the career services option will save more time and allow you to meet with a career services member at the best time. GSU Career Services is free, so you don't have to waste tuition money paying for the DLL program. (GO)\n* You are **looking for recommendation letters, networking, and other mentor opportunities**. This course suits those who don't already have those established relationships or need to develop more connections therefore you might find value in this course. (GO)\n\nMy original review may sound harsh, but I've noticed that first-generation students and those new to internships or jobs gained much more from the program than I did.I am not first gen, and I came in with work experience, so I didn't receive some of the same benefits that some of my peers did; however, seeing the community that the course helps was inspiring. Nevertheless, GSU has a Career Center that provides similar services, which can save you time and might be more applicable for students who don't need as much hand-holding in the job search.**I know this was long, but a review like this would have really helped me decide, and I hope it can help you and future students decide.** Ultimately, consider your personal and professional situation and goals before enrolling in the Digital Learners to Leaders program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nu/WWJJF and u/tribore260419",

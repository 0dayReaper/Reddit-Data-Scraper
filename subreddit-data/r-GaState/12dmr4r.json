I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s something the registrar updated to cause the bill to come in now or what, but they\u2019ve been just passing me off to other departments saying that it\u2019s not their fault. Is anyone else experiencing this? Why didn\u2019t they tell me I lost eligibility 3 years ago if that\u2019s the case?",

I will be a third-year next semester, do I have no experience with this, but could it be possible that your HOPE ran out going into your senior year? I think that's a thing which happens - like HOPE only covers like, say, 100 credits but you need 120 to graduate for example. That happened to some of my GSU friends who graduated and my brother at Tech.\n\nEither way, they should've really let you know :/ I hope you don't owe that",

Also in your GAFutures account, select My College Hope Profile from the side menu to see the credits that count towards Hope on your transcript &amp; checkpoint history. \n\nDual enrollment and learning support credits are not counted for Hope. If you had transfer credits, it's possible they were entered in late. If you ever withdrew from all your classes for a semester and got all Ws, you can get an exception appeal from GAFuture's to have those credit hours forgiven if you had a valid reason like medical emergency.",

I made a ticket about something incorrect within my paws portal regarding financial aid &amp; EFC and the response is just \u201cwe got this information by doing x,y,z. Case solved\u201d\n\n?? I know how you got the information I am telling you there was a mistake in the process and a correction needs to be made so I\u2019m asking how to make this correct lmao anyone else have these types of communication issues with GSU?? Half the time the grammar is even off",

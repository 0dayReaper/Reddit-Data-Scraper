    "postText": "So more than 3 weeks ago, they sent me a email saying that my international transcripts was incomplete, so I had asked my school counselor to send it to them the transcript through email again but my application checklist still showed that it was awaiting.\n\nSo I sent a email a week later to check if they received it, then no reply. A week passed then I ended up trying the contact button on the applicant status page instead to see if I could get an answer, and no response either till today.\n\nDid I do anything wrong or is this just how it is? I am scared that if they really didn't get it I would just be unaccounted for admissions. Should I contact someone else?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: I eventually got a response just around a month after my first email, and they responded with an email about my counselor making a mistake, and just within a week after that was solved, I got an acceptance letter :)",

Admissions receives thousands of student transcripts in email, most of them sent in May, and each must be individually uploaded. This takes a lot of man hours, with few staff members. The international Student and Scholar Services dept should be able to assist you further in this.",

Also I fully understand and appreciate the work of the Admissions team and I am only asking for confirmation that they received it just to be sure I am considered. As my experience in another university, they had just overlooked and forgot my transcript and the deadline just passed and I wasn't even counted for admissions, so I am trying to learn from my mistakes and try to check in more to ensure everything is in order.\r  \n\r  \nI will send an email to the International Student and Scholar Services, as to your advice and I hope I have better chances there. Thank you very much for your suggestion!",

They can help you get in touch with various departments - including checking in with admissions to see what\u2019s going on.\n\nYou also have undergraduate academic advisors at GSU, so someone who is assigned to your major who creates plans according to what the major requires and can answer questions about major requirements. Sometimes, international students have extra requirements to meet though, and that is why you have an international advisor in the ISSS and an undergraduate academic advisor. If you are a grad student, your academic advisor will come from the department youre getting your degree from.\n\nBecause schools like GSU are so big, students really can struggle to have all their requirements met without getting in touch with administrative staff who can help. You\u2019re not doing anything wrong yourself, but it does sound like you need some extra support to get this solved!  Reach out and ask ISSS if they can help you with getting your transcripts in and that hold removed!",

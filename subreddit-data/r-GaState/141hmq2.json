    "postText": "Is human communication easy? Specifically with Joshua Hollibush. I registered for this class because my advisor said it\u2019s easy. But the instructor wants us to use the connect program which costs almost $90. I\u2019m not trying to pay all of that. So does anyone have experience with this specific class or professor and is it easy?",

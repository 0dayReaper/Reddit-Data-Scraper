It's very cold it creates this environment where no one really cares and is in their own world. \n\nHow I made my \"Friends\" is through my classmates that you will typically see in your major/pathway. \n\nMy secret if you really want to build those connections that are more meaningful, Is to talk to people from GSU outside of a school setting you may find interesting. You really get to know someone who they really are outside of a school environment.",

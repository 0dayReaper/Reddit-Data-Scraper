I've never been on campus nor have I received any information on what to do on the day of graduation. \n\nCan someone please help? Like are there special places designated for online students or business major students? I'm not sure how this works, so I'd appreciate all the help I can get. \n\nI've already done all the graduation materials and RSVP and all that.",

I usually stick around 3-4 classes a semester depending on if there are labs (exercise science major). \n\nYou can certainly do it but be ready to sacrifice a lot of time to balance the 2, you\u2019ll need a good work ethic and time management but I\u2019ve come to sometimes enjoy the productivity. It can certainly be stressful and draining but some students, like us, don\u2019t have the same path and benefits as others. \n\nMy usual schedule is work and school M-F but I always give myself the weekends to see my bf or friends. I cannot encourage enough to make sure you set aside time for yourself and to relax. Something I need to work on myself.\n\nYou will quickly adapt and once you get in the routine it\u2019ll become second nature balancing everything! Also it\u2019s very beneficial to have a job where they can be flexible on scheduling in case you have an exam or something.

I hope to create booths for school connections/information, cultural foods, teacher education (geared towards SLIFE/ELLs), and local resources (geared towards ELLs)\u00a0 be set up. \n\n**I wish to coordinate with local multicultural/multilingual PERFORMERS/MUSICIANS/EDUCATORS to come and preform/talk.** \n\nMy goal is to create a space where, outside of just the ESOL classes, ELLs strengths are appreciated, all educators can gain more information regarding their students, and more community members can become active participants, so that they may grow in their understanding of others.\n\nEast Cobb is home to families of several multicultural/multilingual backgrounds. In addition it holds many resources for its' families and the English Language Learner community. Unfortunately, many of these resources are unknown. Events for multicultural/multilingual families are minimal and often are only associated with the school. By talking with members of the community, if found there was a want for a well promoted event that would bring all of the community together, regardless if you are currently associated with a school.\u00a0",

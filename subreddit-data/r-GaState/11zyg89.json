I haven\u2019t submitted my intent to enroll bc of that. did anyone get their letter even if they didn\u2019t submit their intent to enroll? KSU has already sent me a letter but i\u2019m rlly getting impatient since i\u2019ve submitted my FAFSA since it opened. Several people have gotten it but i\u2019m just rlly wondering if that\u2019s the reason why i haven\u2019t gotten anything.",

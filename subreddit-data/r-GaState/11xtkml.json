If you are not spending much time and are often distracted, then setting aside time to do your school work would be a good way to improve grades.",

Those two classes as well give me a hard time in terms of how to study to best maximize the information to transfer over when doing test.",

My brain doesn't function well that night, so I rather hit the sack and come back later.\n\nWith regards to mathematics - it's important that you grasp the big picture. What I mean by that is don't get bogged trying trying to figure out where to plug things. Try to understand the intuition behind each topic. When you read practice problems, ask yourself if you understand what the problem is asking for and try to identify the concepts/topics you will need for the solution. Ideally, you should be able to derive the formula you will need to use. This really comes in handy when you forget things.\n\nIf you have time to spare, visit your math professor during office hours or schedule online Webex sections. Don't be afraid of appearing dumb, you can only get smarter by doing smart things.",

It\u2019s always been a tough subject for me and I struggled significantly taking college algebra, and elementary statistics isn\u2019t that hard tbh it\u2019s just with everything else I have going on it\u2019s harder than it would\u2019ve been without everything else.",

But having to work two jobs as well as doing classes hasn\u2019t left me with much time to study although I try to as much as I can. Two classes that I have I have a hard time studying hence why I asked if anyone had gotten it I didn\u2019t need obvious tips. Thanks tho!",

I took college algebra and got a F one semester because I honestly wasn\u2019t in a good head space and I\u2019m terrible at math, I took it again and got a C not great but better, do you think it would be smart to see about doing that for that class? I know it might not change my gpa or anything drastically but it would probably be good to not have an F on my list of grades",

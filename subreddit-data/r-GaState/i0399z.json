As an F1 freshman student, all the people and offices I've emailed so far replied very fast; my advisor, ISSS office, the \"scholarship manager\" idk how to call him. My admission experience is also great. Good luck guys, maybe it's not all terrible!",

International students are big money, they wouldn't risk losing that lol. Jokes aside, it isn't bad being an F1, ISSS has always been really responsivein my experience; just the general experience of how GSU treats us students sucks big time, especially considering the response to COVID.",

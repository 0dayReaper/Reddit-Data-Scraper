I feel like those same people grew up in a different environment then being in the city and was never taught how to act and what to do and not do in the city so when they came here, it was almost like culture shock and they were scared of being in downtown Atlanta, so you just have to be smart when walking around. I think the second group of people who don\u2019t like GSU probably had a hard time making friends and building connections with people. This isn\u2019t really a party school. Georgia State is a big school and also a commuter school which is good and bad but the good thing is that there are lots of clubs, organizations and events to meet people. \n\nYou mentioned that you liked the design programs here. I don\u2019t know what specific major you were talking about but I am a graphic design major, the program itself is competitive but it\u2019s definitely an experience. Also you\u2019ll be in smaller classes for your art courses, from personal experience, the friends I do have, came from those classes.",

Folks who commute, who have lives, who are going back to get an education, or whose parents don\u2019t make all that much and are hoping for a better future. \n\nAs an academic advisor at GSU when students tell me they want to leave, i let them to go where fits them best. Some other schools truly do fit students who want a traditional mainstream college experience and can afford it. Some other schools are more online. Some other schools have lower standards. There are a myriad of reasons folks want to leave any university.

Both schools have very different experiences because of the surrounding area and the student population. \n\nI think UGA has more resources than GSU because it's simply so huge. Keep in mind though that a lot of those resources are going to business and agriculture students. So if you're pursuing design, I can't imagine the curriculums being all that different. In fact, I would think that being based out of Atlanta would be a lot better for design majors. \n\nAnd, quite frankly, people still take GSU grads seriously. I think there is this notion that GSU students coast through their courses, but if you want get into a design career, you have to put in the work just like anyone else, and that will show up on your CV/resume. I can't say that I am very familiar with the design field, but I just have a hard time imagining people discriminating against someone who went to GSU instead UGA. And if a person does, they're not a person worth working for.\n\nOne thing to mention is that UGA may have more study abroad opportunities in France than GSU. I'm sure GSU has opportunities too, but as a graduate student, their study abroad programs were not on my radar, so I don't know much about them.\n\nAtlanta's cost of living is a bit insane these days... I don't know if it would be cheaper than Paris... Not sure what the tuition situation would be for that Paris school either. Just some other factors to keep in mind too.",

Take that how you will. At the end of the day it's just college and its a small portion of your life. Don't make it a massive deal.\n\nAlso, go to Paris. Experiencing a different country and culture is going to make the experience way more fun.",

If you like Gsu for Gsu, then it wouldn't hurt to go.\n\nThat being said, that Paris offer sounds really cool. I don't know anything about the everyday culture there so I can't make the judgment call unfortunately.",

            "comment": "Dude, for probably 90% of career fields, as long as you get your piece of paper, no one gives a shit where you went to school.\n\nThere are exceptions- like if you want to be an engineer, then yeah, GATech with probably do you better than GSU. Some other fields like pre-med may also have a very slight advantage if they want to apply to T10 or T20 med schools if they go to the \"better\" undergrad.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the most important thing is to go somewhere where you will be happy. You are about to spend the next 4 years at this place so you better make damn sure you like living there. I always advise people against picking the \"better\" school just because its \"better\" unless you are in one of those niche fields where higher pedigree will get you into a better school for higher education or the school has a really top tier program for your field of interest.\n\nFor my first undergrad (I'm weird, I had 2 bachelors- first undergrad in my homestate in music, second bachelor's at GSU in chemistry, now a chem PhD student at GSU). For my first undergrad in my homestate, I got into a \"better\" school than the one I ultimately chose. The \"better\" school was in a college town with a very boring looking campus where literally every single student dressed the same and looked the same (I've never been to UGA, but sounds like a similar vibe to this school). All the guys dressed like frat bros and the girls all had the messy bun, the school sweats and ugg boots. I just knew there was no way I'd find \"my people\" or be happy on that campus. I ended up going to a way more diverse school in the middle of a really cool city that had lots of my kind of artsy people and tons of fun stuff to do. I have no regrets.\n\nGo where you will be most happy. If you like GSU, go to GSU.\n\nParis sounds dope though, but I'd highly recommend starting to learn French now if you don't already speak it. I've been to Paris before and don't speak French at all. Wonderful city, but I definitely felt lonely and isolated towards the end of the trip not being able to speak the language. And I was only there for 10 days on vacation lol. \n\nI would check out study abroad opportunities in France if committing to the full thing is intimidating.",

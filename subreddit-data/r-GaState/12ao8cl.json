If you\u2019ve taken any of these classes with the same professor then please let me know the format of the class as well as your experience in the class . Thanks in advance",

            "comment": "Psychology of Aging with Dr. Barber was my favorite class a couple of semesters ago. Dr. Barber is an amazing professor. I can\u2019t remember the exact format of the class, but I do know there is an assignment you have to do where you interview two people over the age of 60 and write a paper about it. I made an A in the class, it\u2019s not difficult, and Dr. Barber explains all of the material very well. When I took her class I got COVID and she was very understanding and was able to extend the deadlines for a couple of assignments for me. Overall, Dr. Barber is a really great professor and I think that class would be pretty easy to take over the summer.",

The majority of the content in the course is within the lectures, I didn\u2019t buy the textbook and still did well in the class. I also remember she had us watch documentaries about certain things and do reflections about them. Basically just a word doc. where you filled out the answers.",

            "comment": "I took Abnormal Psych with Page Anderson and Psychology of Aging with Barber last semester. I got A+ in both classes. \n\nBoth courses have tests that are open book/open notes. No lockdown involved.\n\nI recommend taking Page Anderson's class. \"Tests\" are 5-10 multiple choice questions over two chapters. But they are weighted 5 points each out of 160 total points. The \"final\" is a True or False test also worth 5 points. The bulk of your points earned are from and the chapter quizzes and practice online.\n\nPsychology of Aging is easy as well, but there's actual work involved. You write a paper, application assignments, take 3 tests (drop 1) but no final.\n\nBoth are easy A's. Abnormal is easiest of the easy A's.",

I\u2019ll be taking the course online if I choose it so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019d still require working with someone else like would I have to go to class to do the case studies with someone else . Also, for psychology of aging, how many exams were there and was there a final exam or a  final paper to write? Also, what helped you in passing the  quizzes or exams. I\u2019m leaning towards it but I\u2019m not sure as I\u2019d prefer an interesting class but something low stress since I\u2019d be taking it in the summer",

Again, they are absurdly easy, 10 questions max. \n\nI took both of these courses online. \n\nPsychology of Aging had 3 exams (best of 2 counted) plus one final. One paper based on interviews. I'm not sure if you would have time in the summer, but I wrote one in the fall.  \n\nYou just need notes to pass exams. It's open book/open notes, and the questions are literally pulled from lecture notes.",

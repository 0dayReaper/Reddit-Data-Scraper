However, I\u2019m getting emails about how I\u2019m being enrolled in icollege classes for the algebra 1 and precal tests when I should\u2019ve tested out with my Bc credits. My friends are having the same issue as well. I\u2019ve emailed the university academic center and they still haven\u2019t responded to me. Is this normal? And for my other AP scores coming in that have a placement test, like AP Chem, will I be placed in a placement test course before the scores come in?",

For example, I had credits from Stats and Calculus and I exempted from a chemistry course and another random elective course. But you still have to take the math classes. That\u2019s how it was when I was a freshman. \n\nYou go straight into General Chemistry 2. If your test score is high enough to exempt, you just exempt Chem 1211. You have to take 1212.",

And then for the Chem pathway, organic Chem takes calc 2 at the same time. If I can exempt out of all gen Chem courses with my AP Chem score, how am I supposed to take calc 2 at the same time as organic Chem if I\u2019m stuck at calc 1? Am I just unable to take those classes then?",

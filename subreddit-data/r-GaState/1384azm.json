    "postText": " Hey guys!\n\nI was wondering if anybody knew how HOPE would affect a student interested in double majoring. I'm finishing up my first year while already studying sociology (planning to get my PhD eventually). I already have almost a year extra's worth of credits because of high school and summer classes, mostly core requirements and a few electives. However, I'm super passionate about French (and yes, I'm aware it's a near-useless degree on its own). I have my reasons for taking it, but the only thing holding me back from double majoring in it is the financial situation. There's no way I could afford to do it without HOPE and I'm not willing to switch my current major.\n\nThe financial website is kind of wishy-washy about it and not outright clear. I'm unsure if I could do it at all, or if I just have to be strategic about my courses to make sure I finish both majors in the same semester. Could anybody enlighten me?\n\nThanks!",

My resume honestly only has regular jobs(customer service, retail etc.) the BUSA class were required to take helped me tailor my LinkedIn and I applied to every internship I could. I applied to a few that needed to go to the external website but I mostly applied for all the ones that had the LinkedIn easy apply feature. I did get a lot more denials than interviews so don\u2019t let that discourage you. Every time I found myself bored and not doing anything I\u2019d go to LinkedIn. If you like you can PM me and I can go into more detail on how i prepared once I got the interview as well!",

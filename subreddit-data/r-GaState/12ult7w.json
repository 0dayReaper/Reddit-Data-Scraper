    "postText": "Background: I am enrolled in a B.A. program at GSU. My major is Africana Studies. I am supposed to graduate during summer semester. I'm not doing too well in one of  my current classes. If any of the classes I'm currently enrolled in do not pan out, I will have to graduate a semester late.\n\nSo I'm taking a class right now that is supposed to count towards my Area G major graduation requirements. I've never had a C grade before but for this one class the best I can do is a 71 after finals. According to the professor that equals a C- grade.\n\nBecause this class is one of my Area G classes, it is stated that a C or higher is required to count towards graduation. If I get a C-, will it count? Because if it doesn't the stakes are high and I'm not sure if I should bother taking the final.\n\nIf anyone had advice that would be much appreciated.",

Or they end up grading on a curve.\n\nYou\u2019ll never know unless you try.",

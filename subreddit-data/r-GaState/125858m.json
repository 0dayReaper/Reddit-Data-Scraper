    "postText": "I sent in my application at 10:38pm on the day it was released (Jan 23) and was put on the male waitlist (218/603). I\u2019m guessing because of the time I sent my application is why I was put on the waitlist. Does anyone know when they might start taking people off. I emailed them and they said that\u2019ll remove people from the list \u201cas students cancel their applications or their room assignments\u201d. Are these students who also payed the 250 for their application, because I\u2019m not sure if 218 are gonna cancel their applications :,(",

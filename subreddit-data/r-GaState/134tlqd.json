    "postText": "I met with an advisor earlier this month to see why I wasn\u2019t getting any aid for summer sem, and she told me I had exceeded the credit limit for hope (I have 127 hours, the limit is 120). She said this excluded me from Hope/Zell scholarships and grants. I was pretty bummed but accepted what she said. I had filled out the application for hope/Zell prior to our meeting but just thought they would reject me. Few days ago I get an email that I\u2019ve been awarded a zell scholarship (good amount of money) and I can accept it for my last two semesters here. I\u2019m wondering if this was an error, or if anyone else has had this happen? I\u2019ve previously had issues with FinAid (they failed to disperse my federal aid one semester) and I have half a mind to just accept the money and move on. I know I should probably speak to another financial aid advisor, but I\u2019m scared they\u2019ll take the scholarship away. Any advice?",

I guess they didn't check my GPA even though it dropped after spring semester, and all of a sudden in December my balance for fall semester went up to $600. They applied some grant without me asking to cover that difference. Then I had HOPE for the following spring semester.",

When I started this semester I was told 3 different times I was not eligible (for different reason than you) and then like two weeks after school started they gave me hope and I asked about it AGAIN and the lady was literally like \u201c\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if it\u2019s there, it\u2019s there, they decided to give it to you so take it\u201d \n\nAnd they never asked for it back so far but I did wait like a month before doing anything with the money. I\u2019d literally just keep asking different people until you get an answer that satisfies you. I asked 4 different advisors about it\n\nPersonally 3 of the 4 advisors i went to were online because I wanted in writing in case. I\u2019d definitely cover your ass in some form. Put it in writing and remember the people you\u2019re talking to names and tell them people are telling you different things, if you get different answers",

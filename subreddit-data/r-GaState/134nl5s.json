To facilitate that, I would like to tell you about the housing group chat. The Housing &amp; Roommates @ GSU group chat is a place to secure housing, search for new roommates, and talk about anything on and off-campus housing. This community encourages our students to seek quality housing options and gain new perspectives.\n\nIf you are interested in joining the group chat, feel free to click the link below:  \n[https://groupme.com/join\\_group/60204497/UvQFwgPt](https://groupme.com/join_group/60204497/UvQFwgPt)",

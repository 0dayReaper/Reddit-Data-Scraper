Shadow the security guard of the parking deck is literally my personal hero and was definitely worth the rent alone. I never needed maintenance for anything and it came with a washer and dryer. The amenities aren\u2019t anything special but the location was decent. Living next to city hall can be super annoying but for school purposes, it was a great option if you can afford it. It\u2019s a mix of college kids and business people so it\u2019s not super rowdy.",

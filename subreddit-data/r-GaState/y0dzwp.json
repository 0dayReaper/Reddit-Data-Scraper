If he let it slide, this would be enough for me to cancel my season tickets.\n\nShit\u2019s embarrassing for the entire institution.\n\nThere is a reason they are called the Trash Down South.",

During the game against Georgia State, he ripped out one of the dreadlocks of a Georgia State player, then taunted him with it. While that action is reprehensible, I understand the heat of competition, and so I wouldn't be writing this email if he owned up to it and apologized to the player after the fact.\n\n&gt;\tHowever, Danny decided to double down on this by posting a picture of it on Instagram, captioned \"you ain't really livin like that #souvenir.\" This post is now deleted (I imagine the comments were against his action) but I do have a screenshot of it as proof he posted it (the screenshot is attached). This is, to say the least, disgusting, not to mention certain undertones that both the action and the post have. Danny is a 23 year old grown man, and he had a full 24 hours to not make this post, yet he did.\n\n&gt;\tI would hope Georgia Southern's football players are trained with more discipline than that, and I hope some punishment is handed down from this. I know at Georgia State, Shawn Elliott would be ripping this player a new one and benching him for the week. I hope the same happens here.\n\n&gt;\tThanks, [my name].",

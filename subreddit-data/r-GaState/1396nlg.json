    "postText": "Knowing I was guaranteed four A+'s this semester, I was stressing out over my fifth class with a graduate student professor teaching the subject for their first time and whether or not I would receive an A or A-. I knew that I would be depressed if I received an A-, so I really wanted an A. The professor missed the initial grade submission deadline, which unnecessarily extended my anxiety. When I emailed the professor about this in the morning, I was thanked for reminding them to upload the final grades and was told I received an A-. I almost broke down in tears since I was pretty sure I received an A in the class and anything less than an A is a failing grade for me. Luckily, after demonstrating to them that there is no way I received a 90/100 for an A-, eleven hours later they emailed me saying they made an error when initially calculating my final grade and that my real score is a 94/100, or an A.",

I felt it was unreasonable for me to have achieved an A- for my performance in the class, which it was. If the professor proved to me that an A- was reasonable, I would have had no choice to be content, but I would be gravely disappointed for a few days at least. I am not joking when I say I almost broke into tears when I saw the professor's email saying I received an A-. I was legitimately hyperventilating. It felt as if the world was ending.",

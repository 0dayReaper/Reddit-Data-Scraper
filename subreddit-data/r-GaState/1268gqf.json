Anyways, I have a friend visiting me from out so state and don\u2019t want to endanger her. Where are the alternative places to park overnight on campus?? Thanks so much.",

She has had no issues at all this semester, and on the rare occasion I drive to campus I have parked there as well and had no issues. Just remember to park by other cars, leave valuables hidden, etc. and you will probably be okay. If not, there is an overnight lot further up the street by the Sheraton that is about 10-15 a night depending on weekends.",

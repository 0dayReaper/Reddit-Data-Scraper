All the honors courses I've taken however, have just been general students and honors students in the same course, and the Honors students have an additional assignment on the side. \n\nIn the end, it really just depends on your major, your involvement, and what your trying to achieve. In my major, there aren't many honors courses available, so I'm really just taking random Honors courses to stay in the college.",

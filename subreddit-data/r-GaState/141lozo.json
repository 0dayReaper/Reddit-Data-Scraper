I needed this form complete and now the next soonest appointment is June 15. I\u2019m at a complete and total loss at the moment. She doesn\u2019t show up, and hasn\u2019t responded to my last email either. And the advisement center just says book through navigate but I can only book HER through navigate and she\u2019s skipping every appointment I make. I\u2019m probably going to have to drop my summer courses.",

This caused lots of wasted time and effort so here\u2019s some rec\u2019s. What I ended up doing was bringing my degree audit to the sessions with my advisor (who would change almost every semester) to double check what they were recommended vs my actual degree track. Many times they were not well versed or not sure what courses I should take and may have suggested a wrong class. Double check what they say and make sure that it aligns with the rec\u2019s you need to actually graduate on your timeline. \n\nAnother piece of advice, if you can\u2019t get a hold of your advisor and have holds that you need cleared, just walk in   IMO it\u2019s better to speak to someone immediately, check their rec\u2019s with your degree audit, and get those cleared vs waiting on \u201cyour\u201d advisor (who may not even work there anymore) to respond to your email/call you back.",

Walks in can also be virtual so you can just drop in from home. \n\nI'm not saying you haven't had difficulty, and I'm not making excuses for your advisor, but it doesn't sound like you are making use of all of your options. It's def not difficult to see an advisor especially if youve been trying for months.",

So even when they're present, they may not (usually do not) understand your intended major. \n\nThat said, walking in is probably the best thing. It is very hard to ignore a physical presence (but be nice - the on duty people are swamped and are undoubtedly not the problem). I would also let the dean of students know about your ongoing problems. Advisors do have reviews and can be disciplined if they aren't doing their jobs.",

Most of the advisors haven't even been there that long, nor do they stay long either.\n\nApparently, the advisement used to be tied to each college. So the advisor for English one ever worked English tracks, and usually only for a certain level. That way they knew their stuff.",

Make sure you express your sense of urgency, also if you do not mind disclosing, what form do you need? make sure you are contacting the correct department. I've had to hold on to the phone for over an hour to speak to someone and there have been times when I've called every single person from the department until someone picked up.",

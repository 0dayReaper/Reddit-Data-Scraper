I just want to be able to review the syllabus to make sure I'll be able to manage both classes since I plan to work over the summer. Even if the syllabus is not for these specific teachers, I would appreciate it if someone could send them to me. Feel free to message me if you have one of them and don't mind sending it. :)",

I did add/drop and this syllabus is almost identical to the one I dropped. Same software and book for sure. I can send you her syllabus. It says \u201cfailed to retrieve chat content\u201d when I try to message you.",

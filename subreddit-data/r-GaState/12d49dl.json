    "postText": "So I just applied to the college of education and human development for fall semester and i only got 2 classes left im taking this summer to finish up my area A-F classes. Problem is, im currently taking bio1104k and im pretty sure im gonna fail since its pretty rough and I'm like, hella worried that i will get rejected by the college of education if i flunk this. I've passed like, all my other classes and i was gonna finish up 2 classes during the summer. Do yall think it'll be ok if i fail this class and take it again during the summer??? If I don't get into the college of education this fall, my advisor says the next time i can apply is 2025...im really stressed about this cause apparently my hw grade is like 55% even tho ive done all the hw stuff and im not sure what happened, i missed 4 quizzes, i failed an exam and im stressfully studying for the next exam thats coming up super soon. also- would taking 3 classes during the summer be too much orrrr",

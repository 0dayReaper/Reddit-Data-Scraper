    "postText": "My parent and I originally submitted the PP Loan on my FSA ID but were instructed to resubmit again under theirs. Naturally, I expected a rejection message from the Financial Aid office for the first one, but then I received another one? I am confused because I had a hold on receiving my financial aid rewards on PAWS but it went away after the second  PP Loan form was sent. \n\nDid they accept it or not? Did someone mistakenly email me the wrong update? (I'm trying to call them now but they have me waiting forever.)",

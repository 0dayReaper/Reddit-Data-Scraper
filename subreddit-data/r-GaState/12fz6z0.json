    "postText": "Hi.\n\nI am a Master's student at Georgia Tech. I am currently trying to understand the experience students with disabilities have with the accommodations process as they transition from high school to university for one of my projects.  The aim is to identify barriers in the accommodations process and to design a platform that will help students overcome them. The research and platform isn't tied to any specific university and hence it would be extremely helpful to have a wide pool of respondents.\n\nThere isn't any incentive for this, but I would really (really!) appreciate it if you could take some time out to fill this survey: [https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_3qsgXxtS89xYJuK](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3qsgXxtS89xYJuK)\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: The survey has been closed as of 17-April-2023. Thank you all so much for your responses! Really appreciate it.",

I\u2019d check from 2017-2023 on the NACADA website, it\u2019s pretty user friendly and they don\u2019t have too many publications a year so it\u2019s not much to sort through but may offer some more help for the paper",

Administrative offices have also increased our efforts to protect staff and students from protesters whose presence threatened safety in our offices.\n\nACAB but let\u2019s not pretend GSU isn\u2019t actively fighting to help minorities and underprivileged daily.",

Honestly my entire criminal Justice education at GSU was \u201ccriminal Justice in America is broken and here is how we can fix it.\u201d\n\nBecause of my previous work in jails, substance abuse centers and homeless shelters in the area before returning to work at GSU, and my education at GSU and KSU, I do not believe current policing practices in the US is ethical or just. And I think the folks who work in the field and use practices that are unjust or unethical are complicit in that.",

GILEE brings in forces like Israel\u2019s to cross train with other police forces, including APD. There\u2019s also a 2011 state law that preempts FOIA requests which essentially makes GILEE a black box. You can\u2019t learn what tactics they share or teach nor who contributes funds to them.

Or do you mean there\u2019s not a link to it you could find? For sure if you feel this negatively about the program, I do hope y\u2019all\u2019s protests will get more engagement, as I haven\u2019t heard anything about them.\n\nIn the same way, I do hope y\u2019all find a way to get the defund Cop City protests to be more effective. Student petitions and working with the GSU social work department would be the first effective step. But last semester, storming 25 Park Place, going to the wrong floor, and scaring employees and students alike in the process really negatively impacted any support the protesters can hope to get from GSU officially, I believe. Y\u2019all should engage with folks who did Occupy Atlanta, which went a lot more smoothly on campus and was more integrated because of the way the protesters chose to behave.",

Look around they\u2019re trying to get working class/poor/ minorities OUT! has you\u2019re favorite local downtown place gotten bought out recently? have your rent prices gone up? have you seen the modern brutalist fancy apartment buildings pop up? it\u2019s gentrification at its finest. the cops aren\u2019t your friend I promise",

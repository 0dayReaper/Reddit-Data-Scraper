    "postText": "I'm  currently a major in environmental science which doesn't offer major courses every semester (it's every other semester: spring 2023, spring  2024, or fall 2023, fall 2024, etc). I requested a course substitution which was approved but now a class that I'm  currently enrolled that was part of my degree plan since january is not part of my degree plan. I know had a hold on my account for a balance even though I was in the class since January. Do I talk with an advisor to add the class back to my program or am I screwed?",

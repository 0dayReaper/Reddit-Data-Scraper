    "postText": "So my paws says that I have attempted 106 hours but only earned 96. I withdrew from college algebra, support for college algebra because I got sick with covid pretty early on and couldn\u2019t recover in time to pass. I withdrew from business analysis and dropped distribution management. When I check degree works it says I have 108 of my 120 hours. Should I be worried?",

Sometimes withdrawals give you a refund sometimes they don\u2019t but the finaid DID go to pay for those credits. Hope financial aid covers 127 credits for students registered as full time every semester and after that you\u2019ll pay out of pocket",

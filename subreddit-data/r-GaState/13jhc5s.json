    "postText": "I am about to receive my bachelors degree in psychology and intend on apply to gsu psychology graduate program. I am a native of metro Atlanta but never lived in the heart of the city. I have some concerns and questions. As a female, does the campus feel safe? Are graduate classes usually in the morning or evening? How is housing for graduate students? If housing is not provided, what is the best location to look for housing? Is there any advice or insight you can provide to me that you wish you knew going into a graduate program, especially at gsu? Thanks!",

Every single one of my classes is at night time time though from 5-9:45 pm but I'm also in the other campus so yea.... It's gonna be night classes most likely as a lot of people have other jobs in the beginning of the day. My roommate undergrad was an masters student so housing is provided you just have to deal with 19 years olds trying to drink possibly .",

            "comment": "Depends on the program you apply to, masters or PhD. I was in the msw program downtown and worked as a research tech with clinical psych PhD students who were taking a lot of afternoon and evening classes due to their work load for their GRA and GTAs and research. The MSW program offered hybrid and asynchronous courses that the psychology program didn\u2019t. \n\nSome grad students felt safe, some didn\u2019t. Really depended on their comfort with crime and one person was from a much smaller city so crime and homelessness was a bit jarring for them. \n\nPersonally I moved off camps in sophomore year in my bachelors program so I had my own home and I much rather commuting and having a lower crime rate in my neighborhood.",

Each set of questions on the study guide for a each concept covered on the study guide has a list of questions that range in difficulty. Typically the hardest questions on the study guide are harder than the actual exam questions. I know that the questions for some topics - mostly topics on the applications of calculus - require you to state reasoning and proofs for somethings. If you need further help, you can ping me.",

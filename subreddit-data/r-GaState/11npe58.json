People go there for emergency care at all hours of the day, so treatment is completed at all hours of the day. Like all hospitals, Grady doesn't have beds to just keep people until the sun comes up. If they've been treated and discharged, the patient is asked to leave - or perhaps told to leave, I'm not sure what the practice is.",

(I think it's okay to argue that if the financial well-being of the institution as a whole relies on slashing the location in the neediest area while shoring up and even building in wealthy areas, you're perhaps no longer honestly serving your public-oriented mission.)\n\nThe rest of your comment is true. The unceremonious closing of ACM absolutely screwed Grady over, even moreso the community that needed access to two functioning healthcare centers.",

                                    "comment": "Yes, they did, and the original takeaway from people who didn't realize they are a nonprofit was that they'd closed because it wasn't making enough profit for investors. Instead, it was because it wasn't lucrative and they thought it would put Wellstar as a whole at risk. \n\n(Paraphrasing, as I don't feel like googling exact words) \"The financial instability of AMC was putting WellStar, therefore all of its hospitals, in jeopardy.\" I think that sentiment may have garnered more sympathy if 1) they had talked in earnest to the city and state about how to remedy issues first (instead of \"surprise, we're closing, ATL govt gets to find out in the same press release as everyone else\"), and 2) they didn't have plans to build a new hospital in a wealthy area that will have a better insured (better paying) patient base.\n\nBeing a nonprofit isn't always easy. And many have to make difficult decisions on service delivery when they consider the solvency of the organization. This may in fact have been the best decision for them. Idk. But the way they went about it is shady as mess and I'll be interested to see what happens with the suits.\n\nFWIW--I've taken a whole two nonprofit law classes, so I'm certainly no expert...I don't think this will cost them their tax-exempt status, but I could definitely see them being put on probation and/or having other serious consequences. I'd be very curious to know what other lawyers, and/or nonprofit professionals think.",

    "postText": "ive been at gsu since fall 2020 and was a finance major up until this semester\n\ni switched to computer science but since i took so many classes already i'll be about 30+ credits over the zell/hope scholarship limit\n\ni'm moving to lawrenceville sometime this summer so i'll only be 10-20 min away from ggc vs 45-1hr from gsu\n\ni have a lot of friends that go to ggc and they like it since the classes are smaller so you feel like you're actually learning since it's easier to talk with your professor, my first experience with a cs class at gsu has been kinda shitty ngl\n\ni don't really think i mind the drive but having to pay for school will seriously bum me out and going to ggc is less expensive? pell grants will cover a good bit i think but it'll be cheaper at ggc.. i will have to talk to my advisor\n\nbut my question is has anyone here transferred from gsu to ggc? or know anyone that has? i feel like i only hear about ppl doing the opposite so i just wanted to hear about any experiences or opinions bc i feel really conflicted and sad lol",

But ggc is nice, classes are small, the campus is nice, I like their library.",

I\u2019ve know a lot of people who went to ggc and loved it.         \n   \nFair warning cs teachers tend to be on the shittier end imo. But great news is everything you need is online. If you\u2019re motivated you\u2019ll be fine.",

            "comment": "I went to GGC for my Nursing degree and now i\u2019m at GSU doing my Master\u2019s. GGC is a great school because of the smaller class sizes, cheaper tuition and how strategically placed it is in Gwinnett. It\u2019s literally in the middle of everything in Lawrenceville. I live about 15 min away from GGC, whereas driving to GSU for my graduate classes takes me anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour. Not too happy about that, lol, which is why I have been skipping class for the last month basically.\n\nI was at GGC from 2013-2018 officially, but I have gone back here and there to take some prereqs and other courses for professional development, grad school, etc. The best part is that you will be known by most of your professors. It\u2019s not so much like the large lecture halls that you\u2019re used to. The largest class at GGC is about 40 students (Business). Science labs are maxed at 24 students. In Nursing, our cohorts were made up of about 32-35 students max. The professors will also try to meet you halfway and work with you if you are having difficulties. Best of luck to you! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy GGC.",

            "comment": "Why not Perimeter College? They have multiple campuses and it would be easier for transferring your credits and stuff. I'm at perimeter and I only have like 14 people in my biggest class.\n\nedit: I know a few CS majors at Perimeter as well and they seem to be doing well. You also would still be considered a GSU student.",

    "postText": "I am currently taking the calc based physics sequence at GSU. I originally took the algebra based physics sequence at GSU due to not seeing the GAtech's course requirement saying that I must take a calc-based physics sequence. I understand that GSU's algebra based physics sequence (PHYS 1111K and PHYS 1112K) are not guaranteed to even transfer credit to GATech, but would this be allowed to cover the lab science sequence portion of the GAtech transfer requirements? Is there anyone who has transferred or tried to transfer to GATech with an algebra based physics sequence covering their lab sequence requirement?",

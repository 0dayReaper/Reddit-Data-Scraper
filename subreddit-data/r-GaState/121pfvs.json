    "postText": "\nTrying to move into a new apartment(not student apartments), but these prices are just too much by myself. My budget is $1250 a month tops (by that i mean I can pay $1250 a month individually and consistently), looking to go half and half with someone and move into somewhere decent like Camden Midtown.\n\nI'm 21 and male. Computer science major, I like to play games, play sports (basketball, football, and volleyball), and I like to watch sports/YouTube/anime. I work security overnight. I'm typically quiet, but not shy. Clean and respectful. I only drink socially, and I don't smoke at all. It's cool if you do, just please not in the apartment. \n\nWe can discuss anything else as we get further along in the process. PM me if interested, I'd like to get moves going relativey soon.",

    "postText": " \n\nHello GSU, \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm currently a Computer Information System student and I realized that one of the most important parts of our college experience is the friends we make and the relationships we build along the way.\n\nDue to the business of the semester and other circumstances, I've found it a bit challenging to connect with others as much as I'd like to. So I'm turning to this subreddit in the hopes of meeting fellow students and expanding my circle. I'm interested in Photography, Content creation, and self-development but I'd love to learn about and appreciate the things you're passionate about as well!\n\nIf anyone's interested in grabbing a coffee \u2615, studying together \ud83d\udcda, or even just having a chat about life, classes, hobbies, or whatever's on your mind, feel free to PM me or comment below. I'd also be more than happy to join any clubs or group activities if you have recommendations.\n\nLet's enrich our college experience together! Hope to connect with some of you soon. Stay safe!",

    "postText": "So I'm a 21 y/o male and I've been accepted into GSU for game design but I have yet to intend to enroll. In a matter of a week and a half I will have finished 45 credits. I wanted to see if any current students had any advice. It could advice regarding the transfer process, housing on the Atlanta campus, food, or mabye stuff specific to game design if any of yall are doing that too. \n\nI know a lot of people talk about the side effects of this campus being in downtown ATL which I'm well aware of (I've lived just outside of ATL for 11 years so I know you gotta be extra careful in some senarios.) Despite that, I've decided that I really wanted to pursue this career within game design and SCAD is way too expensive and I don't think I could get into Tech. I know I could also do online college through some other source but I really wanna make connections and make new friends.\n\nAnyways, if you guys have any advice related to or not related to my degree program I'd appreciate it. \u270c\ufe0f",

If you want to move downtown so be it, i hear their housing and food sucks so find an apt in mid town or somewhere else. It's not that dangerous, you'll see sketchy things sometimes a hobo will offer you things but just say no and that's about it. This is coming from a male however, so females might have a different experience. Stay away from that one gas station, I've never been there and never will be it's cursed.",

I know when it comes to college life, people are more willing to find friends than it may seem at times, so idky I sometimes get nervous about that, lol. As you said about finding an apartment midtown, I'd be down, but that seems to be more expensive unless I'm looking at all the wrong places. Either way, thanks for the advice!!",

You'll find that the professors (research focused or \"tenure track\") and the instructors (education focused) are pretty darn good. They're also a bit stressed because of a general lack of institutional support. \n\nDo get involved with student activities related to your interests. There's an ACM group and an IEEE group. While it's in flux at the moment the CS Hackathon is well-regarded and competitive.",

But if you really can't afford it, your best option may be to consider something like a computer science degree that has a lot of recruitment opportunities.",

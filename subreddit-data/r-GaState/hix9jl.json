Nobody knew much about the virus and it was fairly new to everyone's live. 90 days later, nobody seems to care anymore. States are starting to reopen despite the recent spike (even though it was rumored).\n\nI think if everyone practices social distancing, wear a mask, and washing hands regularly then everything will be fine. Eventually they will find the vaccine for the virus.\n\nMe personally, I cannot afford for the world to stop, I'm not eligible for unemployment, I need to work/be paid, and I need my education. \n\nIf you can afford to stay home, not work, take a break from school/do school online, then fine, thats you. Everyone's situation is different.",

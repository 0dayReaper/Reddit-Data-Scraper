    "postText": "hey guys. I really didn't wanna have to take out a private loan but I'm taking my last required class for my B.S. and last required class for the undergrad part of the 4+1. I really need to complete these but they're over $2500 and I just don't have that right now. I don't make much money at all and my credit score recently dropped to the mid 600s. I've applied to so many scholarships but even if I got most of them the money wouldn't hit my account in time. I got denied for discover, earnest, and ascent (they all said I'd need a cosigner which I don't have) and I have no parental support and 0 efc and HOPE ran out in my undergrad so idk what else to do. \n\nTLDR what is the easiest private loan to get when you're broke with low monthly income and an average credit score",

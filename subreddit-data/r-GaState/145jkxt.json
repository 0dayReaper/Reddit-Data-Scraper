The interview felt like the hardest thing to me but if you don\u2019t feel comfortable going out and interviewing a professional you could probably ask the prof if there are other interview formats you could do (like one through email which is what my prof let me do). If you can organize your time well to get the work done you should be able to ace it. They may have some virtual fairs that you can attend and screenshot w/ your camera on to get credit (just don\u2019t wait till last minute or you\u2019ll have to go in person).",

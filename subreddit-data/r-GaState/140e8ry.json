It also means that once you know, if you're sure you'll be attending GSU, you can prep for housing applications to open and all that. \n\nUnlike some schools, early application to GSU doesn't mean you have to commit here afaik - some schools have an \"early decision\" category that's binding if you're admitted through it.",

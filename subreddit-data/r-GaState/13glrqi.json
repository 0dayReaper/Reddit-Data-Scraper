            "comment": "Potentially. So if you pay for your summer courses and then submit your FAFSA, you\u2019ll receive some sorts of financial aid- you\u2019re pretty much guaranteed to be awarded loans (unless you\u2019re close to the loan limit). You may receive a Pell Grant depending on your EFC (your FAFSA will generate your SAR, which will tell you your EFC. Then you can look up on sfs.GSU.edu the Pell chart to see what Pell grant you would be eligible). And then they\u2019ll check you HOPE eligibility too. So if you receive financial aid or decide to accept loans after your full balance is paid, then that financial aid would be disbursed to you directly. If that makes sense. If it doesn\u2019t feel free to submit a panther answer ticket",

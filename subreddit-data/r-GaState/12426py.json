    "postText": "This isn\u2019t a fully school related post but school is a part of why I\u2019m struggling with what to do.\n\nSo I\u2019m 19 currently a full time college student and I have a part time job as a hotel receptionist that I work on Sundays, and then a full time work from home seasonal job Tue-Sat the job is set to end at the end of April and I liked the wfh aspect so I went to look for other wfh jobs and I got one but it\u2019s a set schedule M-F 11:30-7:30 training is 6-8 weeks starting April 24th. The problem is my school classes were online but I\u2019m going to have to go to school next semester which I don\u2019t think will work with the potential job and on top of that I\u2019ve been looking for internships and I\u2019m going to a second round interview with a company Thursday the internship is year round but $20 an hour but only for 20 hours which is why I\u2019d need to keep another job but I also don\u2019t think the potential wfh job will work with that. I can do back to the hotel and most likely work full time and their flexible with my schedule but pay is $13 vs the other potential job is $17 just don\u2019t think it\u2019ll work with what my schedule might be. I also have an apartment so I pay rent among other things. Just wanting some insight from someone to see if they have any ideas I didn\u2019t think of lol.",

You can always ask the employer to see how flexible they are (it\u2019s worth a shot since you wouldn\u2019t work there if they said no anyways). Next you need to see if $13 an hour plus the part time $20 an hour internship will cover all your expenses. If it doesn\u2019t, consider another full time job with flexibility or ask for a raise. At this point you have all options ahead of you, ask employers questions, the worst they can say is no.",

I\u2019m a sophomore going into my junior year and want some experience under my belt to potentially get other internship offers later into my schooling but if not at least I had one ya know? I do have money in my savings which would be the only reason I\u2019d be willing to stay at my job that pays $13.50 because I\u2019m able to put a lot of my money earned back into my savings after I pay rent and they\u2019re the most flexible. After doing my seasonal work from home job which only paid .50 more I\u2019m only having all of these thoughts bc 1. I love the idea of being home to work as I\u2019m an extreme introvert 2. I feel a bit defeated going back down in pay even with a small gap so I was glad I got an opportunity to work from home and for more pay, but I do understand that people sometimes have to do things they don\u2019t want. My rent isn\u2019t very expensive it\u2019s around 980 and my only other needed expense would be food and then I don\u2019t have an issue with putting the rest into my savings.",

            "comment": "u/babychickenegg \n\nANSWER: \n\nThis question can be easily answered. YES, your hope GPA is correct. The reason it is different from your overall and institutional has to do with HOW Hope scholarship calculates their GPA. Hope weights certain classes differently so if you took STEM classes during the most recent semester you will have a GPA that is weighed differently. This is new since 2017.\n\n\nHERE is the OFFICIAL Website's Wording: \n\nEffective Fall 2017, when calculating the\u00a0HOPE and Zell Miller Scholarship\u00a0postsecondary gpa, an additional weight of 0.5 will be added to grades of B, C, and D for approved degree level science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) courses taken at an eligible postsecondary institution Fall 2017 or later.",

Sherlock, Jr.\n6. Strike\n7. His Friday Girl\n8. Young Mr. Lincoln\n9. Bicycle thieves\n10. Cleo from 5 to 7\n11. The conversation\n12. This is not a film\n\nMost of them were super old and kinda hard to watch, but at least you could play them at 2x speed. I did the class online because I needed a blow off elective, and while I got an A+, I didn't enjoy it. I hear in person is easier.",

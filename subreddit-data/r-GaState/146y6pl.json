    "postText": "So a few weeks ago my hope and Pell were both applied for my summer semester my hope gpa after my spring semester was a 3.1 \nBut for some reason my Hope GPA went down to a 2.6 and my hope is gone just two days ago?? I thought maybe there was a glitch but now it saying I don\u2019t have a refund any more and that I owe $1000+ I\u2019m kind of freaking out bc I thought we atleast get a grace period to get our hope back and I don\u2019t have the money to pay for my tuition I don\u2019t know who I should talk to or if I can even fix my situation \nAny advice would help",

Turns out I lost it at the end of Fall semester but they didn\u2019t calculate until a few days and I wasn\u2019t notified or anything. And technically I lost it twice and can\u2019t get it back :/",

I lost my HOPE like, many semesters ago, but I also weirdly had my Pell grant not apply because it was going to be a refund when I got the College Completion Grant. Ask to see if you're eligible for the college completion grant. My counselor told me it just zeros out your balance. I'm not sure what made me eligible.",

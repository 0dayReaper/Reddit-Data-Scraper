You can manage this depending on the level of discipline you have and structure but there\u2019s going to be a point where you have to do a 20pg lab report, study for ACS, possibly bio lab presentation, and their finals.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend taking science classes like this it\u2019s better to take it with elective or easier classes but hard to say it\u2019s doable bc someone ppl can def do it successfully",

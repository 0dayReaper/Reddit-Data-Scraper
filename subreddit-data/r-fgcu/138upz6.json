    "postText": "Hello all!\n\nI am a transfer student (M20) entering FGCU this fall 2023 and I am in search of roommates looking to stay at North Lake!\n\nA brief summary about me:\n\nI\u2019m pretty open and approachable to generally everything but would prefer tidy/neatness in the mid to upper level. I don\u2019t mind if you smoke or drink; l\u2019m not much of a smoker myself however. I tend to be socially and physically active and would enjoy roommates who share in the interest of being outdoors, working out, and trying new things with others! In the end, ideal roommates would consist of the following traits: extroverted, active, and focused on academics with an openness to getting involved or around campus!\n\nI have tried Roomsync but it's not promising so I thought, \"why not extend the inquiry out to the FGCU reddit community?\" \n\nFeel free to PM me if you are interested in discussing a possible roommate match!",

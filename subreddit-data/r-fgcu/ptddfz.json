I\u2019ve seen a couple different signs advertising LSAT study groups for students but as far as I know they\u2019re not run by or affiliated with FGCU. There\u2019s no good law schools in the area anyway, the nearest ones are at least 2 hours away. Doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of people around here are interested in law school. Just graduated and might do the whole law school thing myself.",

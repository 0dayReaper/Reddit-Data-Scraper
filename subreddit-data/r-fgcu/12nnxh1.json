            "comment": "**Article transcript:**\n\n&gt;Multiple students told the Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) Board of Trustees on Tuesday that they fear a finalist for president of the university, Henry Mack III, would disenfranchise marginalized students.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;They say they're worried Mack would adhere to moves by Gov. Ron DeSantis to create more right-leaning higher educational settings, such as recent changes at New College of Florida in Sarasota.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mack and three other finalists from a pool of 100 applicants were announced Friday. This is the second time the university has narrowed down a list of applicants for the office of the presidency in the past year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the last go-around, two of three candidates decided to withdraw from consideration, and the selection committee opted to begin the process over.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nearly all of the 10 student speakers asked the board not to choose candidate Mack. The board is scheduled to select the next president on May 4, 2023.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mack is a senior chancellor with the Florida Department of Education, and was selected by Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2019 to serve on the Education Commission of the States.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The other three finalists are Neil MacKinnon, provost at Augusta University; Joseph \u201cJay\u201d Morgan, president of Morehead State University and Aysegul Timur, FGCU\u2019s vice president and vice provost, Strategy and Program Innovation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cWe need a president who knows and loves FGCU as a marketplace of ideas, and will not ban opposing viewpoints under the guise of \\[them\\] being 'too woke',\" said FGCU senior Jules Bustamante.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"We need a president who will not attack education; the very reason that we as students are all here. We need a president that will promote uncensored history. We need a president who is not afraid of embracing this campus as a diverse as equitable and inclusive space. We need a president that will give Hispanic students what they need to succeed as FGCU moves forward to become a Hispanic serving institution. We need a president who acknowledges that we are all students united and not at odds with each other. We need a president who can look at every single student and say, 'I see you and you belong here.' Henry Mack is not this president.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There will be multiple public forums with each of the candidates. More information on the candidates can be found on line at: [fgcu.edu/presidentialsearch/presidentialfinalists](https://fgcu.edu/presidentialsearch/presidentialfinalists)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Schedule of public forums for candidate finalists**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;FGCU, in conjunction with executive search firm Greenwood Asher &amp; Associates, is pleased to announce the dates and times for on-campus public forums for the four finalists in the presidential search.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Henry Mack III, Ed.D.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Senior Chancellor, Florida Department of Education - Tuesday, April 18, 2023*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Physical location: Academic Building 9, Room 106*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*11 a.m. to noon*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*4 p.m. to 5 p.m.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Aysegul Timur, Ph.D.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Vice President and Vice Provost for Strategy and Program Innovation, Florida Gulf Coast University - Wednesday, April 19, 2023*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Physical location: Academic Building 9, Room 106*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*11 a.m. to noon*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*4 p.m. to 5 p.m.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Neil J.

He oversees all higher education, career, technical and adult education, disability education, and economic development activities in the State of Florida.\n\nHe also worked at Broward College as associate dean of academic affairs, and as a philosophy professor at Florida International University (FIU) and University of Miami.\n\nMack has graduate degrees in philosophy and theology from the Catholic University of America, and completed his doctorate in education administration and philosophy of education from the University of Miami.\n\nHe currently lives in Tallahassee with his wife, Ashley, and their two young children.\n\n[https://floridaliteracy.org/pdf-docs/henrymackfldoe.pdf](https://floridaliteracy.org/pdf-docs/henrymackfldoe.pdf)\n\n[https://www.asugsvsummit.com/speakers/henry-mack](https://www.asugsvsummit.com/speakers/henry-mack)\n\nHis interview indicates here that he is against teaching \"social justice\" and \"postmodernism\" in higher education, as well as \"critical race theory (CRT)\". Quote:\n\n&gt;\"Postmodernism seeks to 'reconstruct' a world fundamentally opposed to our democratic society and its enduring principles. **It asserts that our governmental and educational institutions rest on arbitrary, hierarchical, patriarchal, misogynistic, or even racist structures\u2014rejecting merit and achievement, in favor of identity politics or essentialism.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Postmodernism contends that a public education aiming at social and intellectual unity for democratic citizenship is oppressive or inherently prejudiced. **Instead, it favors equity over equality, identity over merit, feelings over fact, sociology over science, relativism over realism.** It promotes an education without aims, without virtue, without any desire to cultivate intellectual unity\u2014believing that we should be wholly defined by our differences or group identity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[...\\] **...insofar as we aim to restore the primacy of reason in higher education in Florida, it implies we are combating the infiltration of postmodernist philosophy as the guiding philosophy of public higher education here.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We lament the fact that many of our universities graduate students with an education that is nearly purely formless or silent on the lessons found in the Great Books. **What\u2019s worse, it has become an education system that often compels or cultivates the treacherous belief that students should be taught to either hate others based on race, or that the free society we are so fortunate to enjoy is inherently racist, stacked against the marginalized.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[...\\] To be clear, no one is arguing that postmodern philosophy, Rawlsian pluralism, Marxism, and all their implications should not be taught. Again, if intellectual autonomy is the educational aim, students should never be shielded from any significant viewpoint, no matter its absurdity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The argument here is that living in a deliberative, constitutional democracy requires certain things of us; it makes demands on colleges and universities. The presumption is that the structures and successes of our society reset on the free and informed consent of all its members.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In other words, if judgements of policy are viewed as the fixed privileged of the educated elite, and not the common task of all, and if \u201cthe many\u201d forgo immersion into the philosophical principles and traditions of Western Democracy\u2014that is, an intellectual appreciation of the import of its philosophical principles, rights, and demands\u2014then the concept of free and informed choice, or psychosocial maturity, can hardly be achieved, arguably.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Put differently, 'critical thinking' and intellectual autonomy as objects of higher education, here, may necessarily involve the assessment of those reasons or traditions for what makes for a successful democracy to begin with.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Thus, any graduate of a U.S. ...university, if he or she is to give evidence of critical thinking in this sense, must have a good understanding of (and the ability to utilize) both the subject-specific principles and ideas behind our democracy (separation of powers, individual rights, citizen participation in decision-making, and so forth), and those logical or philosophical justifications that inform his or her assessment of the status or quality of our democracy (namely, those reasons why the subject-specific principles and ideas are good or true).**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Far from an affront to academic freedom, then, the kind of higher education Florida desires is one that actually guarantees it.\"\n\n[https://www.city-journal.org/article/floridas-higher-education-reforms](https://www.city-journal.org/article/floridas-higher-education-reforms)\n\nMack is also a devout \"pro-life\" Roman Catholic, as he recently retweeted another tweet in support of Ron DeSantis signing the 6-week abortion ban bill into law: \"Thank you, Ron DeSantis, for always leading with courage and conviction! What a historic night!\"",

I should rephrase to say that it doesn't appear to be a misunderstanding so much as an intentional misrepresentation. Postmodern theory largely is about the challenging of what is accepted as \"truth\", but to then make the jump to arguing that postmodern thinking is threatening western democracies is absurd .\n\nThrough reading that interview more in-depth, it appears that Mack subscribes to a school of thought that believes that through reason, one can arrive at an objective truth, and that truth is necessarily related to the western philosophical tradition (Aristotle, Socrates, Hegel, Kant, and it appears in particular Locke and Hobbes). \n\nPostmodernism (largely) rejects the ideas of an objective truth and argues that what is \"true\" is largely a social construct i.e. things are true because society agrees they are. He seems to argue that the rigorous questioning of the hegemonic ideals of the western tradition isn't worthy of academic pursuit. Though one would argue back that if the ideals cannot withstand rigorous questioning, are they really worthy of being the philosophical undergirding of a nation. \n\nI think his biggest flaw is the argument that the ideal world can be reached through reason alone. Arguing for this necessitates the reckoning with the lived experience of the world that theory produces. For example, If you look at capitalism from a purely theoretical standpoint it sounds great, but doing that ignores the lived reality of poverty, hoarding of wealth, etc. that is a result of capitalism. Postmodernism questions the idea that capitalism is some kind of objective \"final form\" of economic systems which is of course a threat to the \"western tradition\"\n\nThe Irony is that thinkers like Socrates we're literally killed by those in power for \"corrupting the youth\", the great western thinkers that he holds in esteem were the radical thinkers of their time.",

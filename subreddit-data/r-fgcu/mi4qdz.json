    "postText": "Long story short, I'm going to transfer into FGCU next semester but I already moved down here since I am completely online and to start residency. I'm going to be a junior next semester with an associates.   I have a job here and only a few friends.  Is there anyway to meet people here since technically I don't officially go to school here yet and can't join anything.  Basically i'm looking for advice on how to meet people who go to FGCU since I'm not from the area. Thanks!!",

The campus hasn't been that lively since covid obviously but everyone is nice and there's plenty of ways to meet new people in this area as I've met all of my friends outside of school. Then again, I've been in swfl since 2013",

But, serial class failers I knew had to take the course Effective Learning (along with the classes they were retaking) for academic probation and thus financial aid/scholarship reasons. I never knew someone who had to take the course for a single failed class though. You should be able to retake, though depending on your situation, I\u2019d encourage you to discuss with your professor the option of taking an incomplete for the class if at all possible. An \u201cI\u201d would go on your record instead of a letter grade and you\u2019d have to complete whatever makeup assignments/missed work you both agree on to get the grade changed; timing can vary if they want it to be done, say, in the first month of the next semester or something, but it overall \u2014 your work and their formal grade entering \u2014 has to be done by the end of the following semester for sure or it\u2019ll automatically become an F.",

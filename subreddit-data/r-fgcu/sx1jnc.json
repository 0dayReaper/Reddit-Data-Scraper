    "postText": "Hi everyone! I will be attending FGCU this summer to get my final prerequisite courses done and I am looking for a place to stay from around mid-May to August 17th when my fall lease would begin. I have been looking around and haven't seen anyone subleasing for the summer yet and I was wondering if it was still too early. I had also tried to join the FGCU housing and sublease community Facebook page but my membership is still pending. Anyone have any experience with finding summer subleases?",

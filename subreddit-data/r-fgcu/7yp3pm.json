    "postText": "###The full email contents are as such: \n\n---\n\n&gt;We appreciate that many are discomforted by the language and conduct from outsiders such as \u201cthe Preacher and his minions.\u201d  Please understand that we are very much concerned about the impacts these people have on members of our university community.\n\n&gt;We are, however, constrained by the First Amendment rights of all.  We continue to explore all means of ensuring orderly and safe operations of the campus for all members of the FGCU community within the parameters of the First Amendment.\n\n&gt;I encourage everyone to ignore the Preacher and others like him, since gaining attention seems to be his (their) primary motive.\n\n&gt;And, finally, speaking only for myself and not officially for FGCU, I find the Preacher and his associates offensive, deeply ill-informed and remarkably un-Christian (I say this fully cognizant of my First Amendment rights).\n\n---\n\n",

Both times it was about going to hell for doing any of the things that they had on some banner. \n\n\nSome students argued with them(I don't know why), and the preachers got louder and louder. It was quite the experience.\n\n\nI took a picture on my phone, so I'll try to add it. I'm on my laptop\n\nEdit: Laptop",

He's kind of an all-around cunt about it as most public preachers are. They usually get crowds of students telling them to fuck themselves, debate them, or trying to be funny by engaging in some shenanigans that just gives them more attention. Doesn't help that the preachers don't engage in a single ounce of de-escalation.",

Calling a student on the lawn a disgusting degenerate because he masturbates.\n\nI swerved to miss that whole shit",

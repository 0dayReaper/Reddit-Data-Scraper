    "postText": "Does anyone know when RoomSynce opens up during the spring semester? I'd assume around February, but that's when we reapply for housing... I'm getting kind of worried because all my current roommates are going to be living off-campus next year and I'm taking mostly virtual classes this semester so I haven't had the opportunity to meet anyone. I desperately need to meet people so I'm not rooming with complete strangers next year.\n\nI\u2019m a 20 year old female btw",

The schedule is online and it\u2019s always a blast. \n\nPlus there\u2019s a great chance you will meet like minded individuals and future friends. \n\n\nMaybe check out the FGCU Roommates and subleases if you\u2019re looking for a future roommates or even just to meet some new cool people \n\nTry to eat on campus and talk to new people \n\nI know it can be scary to go up and say hi and introduce yourself, a tour guide once told me once the definition of courage is being afraid and doing [it] anyway \n\nYou sound like a friendly person and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re super fun to be around, being that to the table. Try to be yourself and not worry to much \n\nFriends will come and go, be excellent to your fellow peers and your success is guaranteed",

    "postText": "I don\u2019t know why but as soon as I enter the FGCU rec and wellness center I always see at least 3 people just staring at me upon walking on to the floor. This doesn\u2019t happen at my other gym and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m someone who looks out of the ordinary in any type of way but I don\u2019t understand why people feel the need to stare in the gym, I just hope that if anyone on this Reddit goes to the rec center that they are mindful that everyone is there to get fitness in and to just mind your own business. It\u2019s intimidating going enough as it is and when I immediately walk in and people are looking directly at me for a prolonged period of time it\u2019s uncomfortable and I shouldn\u2019t feel that way when trying to do something to better myself.",

Amped Ft Myers is a great example. Personally I don\u2019t like that gym cause of how crowded it gets, so I go to a gym called Smash in Bonita which is amazing. Hope this helped!",

Those people treat mock other people bettering themselves and getting in shape are judgemental and unkind \n\n\nDo your business get your workout in and anybody gives you a bad look just simply stare right back at them and be like what you\u2019re looking at",

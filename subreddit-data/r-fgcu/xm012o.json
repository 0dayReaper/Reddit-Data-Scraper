    "postText": "I\u2019m going to be transferring to FGCU in the Spring and was looking into the Eagle Transfer Gold Scholarship. Online it says that people who fulfill the requirements automatically get accepted but on the same page it says meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee a scholarship. Does anyone else on here have this? How did you get this scholarship? Did you have to apply for it? I spoke to someone over the phone and was told that I will be sent an email or a letter saying all of my financial info and it will tell me there if I got it but I find it odd that I could receive a scholarship without even knowing it existed. I know I\u2019m probably overthinking it but I don\u2019t want to miss my chance of gaining this.\n\nUpdate: I got it!!! I\u2019m so happy it really helps me a lot! I was going to delete this post since I don\u2019t need it anymore but I\u2019m going to leave it just in case someone else goes through the same struggle I did.",

I was gonna go to another school but something came up. So I accepted the schools offer last minute then I get an email saying you\u2019ve been granted the eagle gold transfer scholarship. I\u2019m here thinking to myself wtf I missed the deadline how the hell \ud83d\ude2d\nHopefully you receive it \nI\u2019m rootin for ya :)))",

The website says that January 1st is the priority deadline and May 1st is the Final deadline but I applied for the Spring semester not the Fall semester. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s only applicable to Fall students since under the Eagle Transfer Gold section it says the deadline is October 1st so I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed that I applied before the Spring\u2019s priority deadline! Also, how do I know if I received it? What should I be looking for?",

Best way to know is to contact them.\n\nWhen you get accepted they send you an \"Award Package\" in the mail that lists like cost and all the scholarships and grants you get. If for some reason you don't get that in the mail you can just check in Gulfline after your account gets set up and stuff.",

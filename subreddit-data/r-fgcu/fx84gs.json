    "postText": "Hello guys! Since the last year, I\u2019ve been working on a project to address the parking problem at universities. I\u2019ve developed a business model with a solution to the problems I identified at FAU, the university I went for my bachelors. Later, I realized from talking to students from other Universities, that the problems are present in most of the largest Universities in the USA.\n\n&gt;Every semester students face the same problem; having to arrive at school 30 minutes to one hour earlier just to be able to have time to find a parking spot. It is a real hassle being able to find a parking spot and it becomes frustrating and stressful. \n\nA group of friends and I decided to continue with the idea and commit to solving the problem. So, to help us better build a solution for the students and the schools, we are asking students at various Universities a few questions about their experience when parking at your university campus. We would appreciate your help with this! We are on the way to developing something GREAT for the infrastructure, not only for one university but for all other universities in the United States.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions.\n\nIt is a Google Forms format, and it will only take you **1 minute!**\n\n**Thank you!**\n\nHere is the link to answer the questions: [**Parking Problem | Student Interview**](https://forms.gle/fYQXJ9LmW4Ypts3H8)",

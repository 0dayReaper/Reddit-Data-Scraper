    "postText": "Hello, I was planning on living in north lake for my sophomore year but I will be unable to because I have a dog and my roommate is allergic. I contacted housing to cancel my contract and they said I can\u2019t, and I could transfer rooms and get three random roommates, but they could be allergic to dogs as well. Has anyone been able to get out of their housing contract?",

Before the pandemic started, I had signed a housing contract for West Lake for 2020-2021 but I wanted to get out it afterwards because I'm immunocompromised. The process was pretty arduous to say the least. \n\nI emailed the housing department and they basically told me I needed to send them several things: a letter explaining why I wanted to cancel, a proof of residency, a doctor's note confirming my immunodeficiency, and proof that all my classes could be taken virtually. I sent them all these things and they eventually did cancel my housing contract but I honestly wasn't convinced they would, they were that stringent about it.\n\nNow, your situation is a lot more different than mine. If you look at the housing contract I think they specify what situations can constitute a cancellation and unfortunately I don't think yours would fall under it. That being said, you can escalate this with the university ombudsman and perhaps they'd be more willing. Good luck.",

Student Care services is in the interest of you and making you\u2019re experience at FGCU enjoyable. \n\nEven if you just put some effort and finding some resources the housing administration won\u2019t seem as intimidating and you\u2019ll be able to work something out I\u2019m sure\n\nAlso talk to one of the people in charge of housing. Set up an in person meeting. One of the directors is Cassie Rembspecer or something. There\u2019s another lady in the housing dept that isn\u2019t so great, something like Lindsey Johns. IMO she goes on power trips and can be aggressive and uncompromising \n\n\nHope this helps, please post an update when it all gets figured out!",

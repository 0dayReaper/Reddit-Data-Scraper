    "postText": "Not sure if this is allowed or not, but I have an intermediate accounting book I'm trying to sell, it's a long story. The book is Intermediate Accounting 16th Edition, by Wiley. It's loose leaf, but I have 500 or so page protectors, as well as a 3 inch binder that's included. DM me if interested! Thanks!",

            "comment": "Hey there\n\nSo the Estero/ San Carlos park area \n\nThere\u2019s the Gulf Coast Town center with Bass Pro Shops, the movie theater that should open back up soon. \n\nAlso around the area is the free to use rec center near Sovi. Also all the Roc in North Lake (NLV) with the beach netball basketball, climbing bars, and beach with water ski something and canoe, paddle, even sailing I\u2019ve learned how to use.\n\n\nAlso there\u2019s some great clubs/ organizations that are out there. Some of these include board game clubs, PC/ counsel games, sorority and frats (which aren\u2019t that good for paying to have friends) \n\nAlso the medieval combat club/ foam fighting which is starting up again in the fall semester. They go on camping trips to Alabama, South Carolina, UF area Gainesville, FSU day matchups. They meet up on the campus rec field with swords, spears, and archery \n\n\nAlso the wildlife club which they go in the food forest and hopefully return to its former glory and go on camping trips into the Everglades and such!\n\nI got more stuff and if anyone is interested :)\n\nEdit: Also the FGCU quidditch club is crazy fun. They do this Harry Potter actually physically demanding sport. They went to Austin, TX last year or somethings.",

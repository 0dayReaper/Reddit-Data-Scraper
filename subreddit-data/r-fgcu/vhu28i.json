It sounds like a very rewarding career, but the ones that I know have to spend more time dealing with bureaucratic bull than helping people and the pay and benefits suck.  And then the actual help you can provide is often minimal.",

Where I live there's a high demand for therapy and there seems to be no end to clients that will do cash pay. All of my cohorts from grad school are booked out and make good money. But it all comes down to what path you want to take. Anything without licensure requirements is as bad as described here. Licensed positions pay better with experience &amp; independent Licensed positions often pay quite well.",

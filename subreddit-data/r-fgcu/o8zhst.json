I was someone who didn\u2019t have many, or at times any friends during high school due to feeling awkward and too shy to talk to new people. I wanted to give Greek life a try because I really wanted to make genuine friendships and connections. In my experience, everyone in my sorority was so accepting and eager to meet me. I believe that the reputation of Greek life being cliquey comes from people who are not in Greek life or didn\u2019t have a good experience with their organization. \n\nThink about it, you don\u2019t know anyone on campus, let\u2019s say you join student Gov and the hammock club. Since those are the people you will be interacting with the most outside of classes, you will likely become comfortable with your friends who have common interests with you, and you\u2019ll be busy trying to cultivate those friendships, so you may not be interested in trying to make more friends with people outside of your club circle because you\u2019re already trying to manage those friendships. It\u2019s the same way with Greek life, and generally the chapters are much larger than the average club so there are plenty of opportunities to meet people with a common interest, so you don\u2019t need to go far to make friends. I think that\u2019s where the perception of Greeks being cliquey comes from. \n\nAnd as far as paying for friends, in my experience, you are paying for membership into an organization and for the opportunity to meet all of these women or men, however the actual friendships and relationships are up to you to form and cultivate, just like any other friendship. Greek life can be really intimidating, especially if you are introverted, and most people are afraid of not being accepted for who they are and what they like, so it seems easier to close yourself off and write Greek life off as shallow or cliquey or whatever. \n\nRant over sorry haha I just wanted to give a different perspective because I have definitely met shallow and cliquey people in Greek life, but you meet those types of people anywhere you go, and in a frat or sorority you realize you wouldn\u2019t get along with that person, but they\u2019re still your brother or sister, and just make other connections. In my opinion even if you look at it from a non emotional perspective, it\u2019s still a great opportunity to network. For example, let\u2019s say you want to be a doctor or a lawyer and you need to find a good internship. You can ask in a group chat of 120 + members, where it\u2019s almost guaranteed at least one of them will have a dad, uncle, etc who could be a great mentor and provide you with valuable experience that you may have not been able to get, or not as easily, if it weren\u2019t for your Greek affiliation.",

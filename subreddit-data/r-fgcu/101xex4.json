But we've also met people through Roblox and Minecraft on there as well. Obviously, we're all college-aged or older. You don't even have to be interested in multiplayer gaming, just pop in once in awhile a have a conversation with someone about what games you play, your gaming setup, what headphones/mic you use, or just sharing memes, etc. Add me at PeachBunny\\_hjk#4424 on Discord if you're interested. We are looking forward to meeting all of you!",

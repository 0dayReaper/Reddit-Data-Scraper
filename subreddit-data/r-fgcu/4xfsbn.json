Here are some fast resources that are mostly useful to first-year students.\n\n----\n\n#Links: \n[Week of Welcome Schedule](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?showTitle=0&amp;showPrint=0&amp;showTabs=0&amp;showCalendars=0&amp;showTz=0&amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;height=600&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=fgcuwow%40gmail.com&amp;color=%231B887A&amp;ctz=America%2FNew_York) \n\n&gt; A good chunk of these events are super fun. I personally recommend doing what you can to get to Casino Night, the Beach Blast, and the Library Welcome Event. Two of those are fun, one of those are legitimately useful.\n\n[Move-In Week Dining Hours](http://i.imgur.com/u7aeo5S.jpg)\n\n[List of Software Available On-Campus, With Locations](http://aets.fgcu.edu/files/Available-software.pdf)\n\n---\n\n#Fast Information\n\n###Campus Services\n\n####**Dining Payment:**\n\n* Cash\n\n* Debit/Credit: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover\n\n* Eagle ID Card: **Dining Dollars, Eagle Dollars**\n\n####**Laundry Payment:**\n\n* Quarters\n\n* Eagle Dollars\n\n####**On-Campus Printing Payment:**\n\n* Eagle Dollars\n\n---\n\n#### **Library Services Overview**\n\nLibrary Printing Prices:\n\n* Black &amp; White: $0.06/page\n\n* Color: $0.30/page\n\nLibrary-Available Services:\n\n* 5 Scanning Machines (Free to use)\n\n* ~250 Windows 7 Computers \n\n     &gt;All with Maple, SPSS, Microsoft Office, and Respondus Lockdown Browser\n\n* 10 Mac Minis (OS X Yosemite)\n\n* Paid Printing; Double-Sided Available\n\n* 4 Audio/Video/Drafting Systems\n\n     &gt;(All with Autocad, Adobe Creative Suite, Solidworks and Sony Vegas)\n\n* Computing Support Desk for all Library Services as well as student computers.\n\n---\n\n###Campus Computing Assistance\n\n**All Housing Network Problems**\n\n* Call the BTS Helpdesk @ (239)590-1188, OR go to Griffin Hall RM 252.\n\n     &gt; Open Monday-Friday, 7:30AM - 5:00PM\n\n**Other Laptop Support**\n\n* The BTS Helpdesk performs Malware Removal and supports student emails, Canvas, Gulfline and Student Websites (Information Systems Class)\n\n* The FGCU Library assists with Malware Removal and general laptop troubleshooting.

Eagle Dollars are a general account used for payment across campus. They can be used in the bookstore, for printing, for laundry and also for dining. With dining, it is important to specify if you with to use Eagle Dollars, as Dining dollars are the default.\n\n&gt; I can't get online in housing.\n\n* You must complete a check and register your system using the Bradford Persistent Agent to use the housing network. Requirements include having antivirus software. Visit resnet.fgcu.edu for more information. WiFi in the main campus does **not have any requirements for access.**\n\n&gt; My internet sucks. What do I do?\n\n* All rooms on campus should have ethernet ports for directly connecting to the network. If you don't have one, check with your housing desk to see if they provide them free of charge. \n\n&gt; Ayy bruh I wanna party and get fucked up and shit\n\n* Moderate your drinking or you'll pass out in the SoVi lobby and be carted away in an ambulance while everyone not involved laughs at you for your lack of self control. \n\n---\n\nIf you're reading this within three or four days of this being posted, you have a ton of time to prep for classes, which resume Wednesday, August 17th. Take that time to familiarize yourself with the campus layout, as well as services you think you'll need. During the weekend, the Library may be the only operating non-dining location on campus. ",

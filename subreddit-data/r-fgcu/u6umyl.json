Work/life balance exists. If you can't find remote work, my suggestion, if you are willing, is to move to a more techie city.  Austin would be good, but Silicon Valley, NYC, Charlotte, Atlanta, Denver...   anywhere bigger and libral  leaning.  Larger cities have more opportunities which would have been more beneficial starting out.",

To be honest you might have to move or find remote work to get the most out of the \u201ctech\u201d side of the degree, in my experience there aren\u2019t a lot of opportunities in Estero, Fort Myers, or Naples for entry level.  \nMy recommendation would be to get the concentration in computer programming, without that I think it would be hard to get your foot in the door with a good paying tech job.",

People said it's very friendly, but others said the smaller campus makes it harder to make friends or join clubs. Thoughts?\n\nEdit: Also, how are the science-related (esp. bio and chem) classes here? I struggle with chemistry but I'm interested in health science. I'm looking for a place with great academics but one that isn't going to leave me in the dirt.",

You can go to a huge university and make no friends if you don\u2019t make the effort and you can go to a smaller school and have a million friends if you get active. Totally dependent on you!",

I came in not knowing anyone and I joined clubs and did everything. But if you don\u2019t go in with at least one other person, it makes it 100x harder. At FGCU I literally made friends that I still hang out with and talk to within a month. \n\nSmaller class sizes mean you don\u2019t sit in an auditorium with 100+ people that halfway through the first month decide to not show up because they don\u2019t take physical attendance lol \n\nBTW, health science goes a bit more administrative (at least here at FGCU) I was a HS major when I was at UCF and it was much more clinical. Here, you\u2019re last 2 years are 100% online (idk if you\u2019re ok with that, that alone made me switch majors) and I\u2019m now a biotech major with a minor in chem!",

I don't really know what exactly I want to major in so I'm not sure if I'd do the health science route but it was something I was considering. I wouldn't want to do it online. I was thinking of going into Public Health. Would that be online?",

There is lecture halls here but probably gone now cause of covid, but even Bio1 only had about 50 kids. \n\nI would say the basic sciences are fine but man I don\u2019t like chemistry in this school I much preferred chem at FSW (15 minutes away community college). But besides that many of my professors are great and don\u2019t regret it(Environmental Studies Major), everybody is friendly and have yet to have something stolen despite too many instances where I deserved it.(if you want specifics I can\u2019t gladly reiterate some of my how did my shit not get stolen stories).",

I did have a great lab professor so that was great and they were relatively easy so lab was alright. But a lot of it was teaching yourself.\n\nI just had a much better understanding of the material with my one professor at fsw for chem and chem 2 as a transient student (dropped chem 2 for personal reasons but was doing fine with that course dude was great) than the professors I took for chem 2 and lab at fgcu. 2.5 hours 2 days a week and his lab was 2 days a week as well.\n\nBut that\u2019s just my opinion, gen chem 2 is notorious for being hard as well as orgo.",

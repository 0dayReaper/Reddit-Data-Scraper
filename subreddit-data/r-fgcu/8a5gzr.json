I've just went ahead and fixed it so you should be able to track the specific class you want! If you just search \"ENC 3250\" on the app, that should bring up all the classes.

Signed up with the shit one to be safe because the other one was full but it wouldn\u2019t let me waitlist the other one because I was already enrolled in the same course. Going to test this app out next time I need to move around my classes.",

Make sure you understand all of those neuro disorders. \n\nWhat I did with my study group is we took turns teaching each thing to each other and came up with three main points for each disease. \n\nLike for MS we said the theirs the MS lesions, and so on. If you can identify key points you\u2019ll be okay!! And most importantly, take some time and just breath! You\u2019ll make it through this. That first semester is rough but the second is so much better.\n\nMessage me if you need any more help!!",

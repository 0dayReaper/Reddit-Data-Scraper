Otherwise the south wing of the Library has little cubicle type spaces you that will feel a lot more isolated and aren\u2019t usually packed",

Also on the fourth floor of the Library, there are little booths set up meant for studying outside of lecture halls but they are rarely ever used. \n\nGood luck!",

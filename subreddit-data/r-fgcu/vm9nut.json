Professor Micheal Collins is not so great and makes you take his class way more seriously and listen to his old life and makes you feel small \n\nAlternatively why is anyone at all paying for textbooks that the professors create themselves. To me that is like stealing money from us college students. \n\nBut yes hospitality is a great program and is reputable\n\nEdit spelling",

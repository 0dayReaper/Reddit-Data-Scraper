I assume it\u2019s in the recreational center? Do we need a membership or is it included in our tuition?",

It\u2019s actually a really nice place\n\nIt\u2019s humble in size but it\u2019s decent\n\n3 basketball/volleyball \n\n\nRunning machines and stuff\n\nFree weights and stuff \n\nOne thing I don\u2019t like about it is how it\u2019s limited capacity. Like I get it\u2019s covid but they take it to an extreme \n\nThough I\u2019ve heard good things that 95% of Americans will be vaccinated by May \n\nFall semester should be a lot more normal",

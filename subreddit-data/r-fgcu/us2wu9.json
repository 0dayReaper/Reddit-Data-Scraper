    "postText": "My family is moving to Florida and I plan to attend Florida gulf coast university but I have zero idea how the American education system works as we have lived in Canada much of our lives. I missed the deadline to apply for 2022 so will plan on attending in 2023 which will give me time to prepare for the sat. I don\u2019t believe my high school marks are good enough to be accepted into this school. I got 90s most of my high school life but grade 12 was a struggle because of personal reasons and my marks spilled a lot. I still got 90s in a few classes but ended up with a lot of 70s. Is there a way I can improve my marks while preparing for the sat?",

This isn't really some big fancy university (although it is very nice in my opinion). You will be accepted.\n\nAlso I would look into the international admissions recruiter, because if I am remembering correctly, you don't have to do any of the standardized testing if you are coming in as an international student. \n\nGood luck and have fun!",

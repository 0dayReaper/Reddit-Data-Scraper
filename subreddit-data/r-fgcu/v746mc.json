    "postText": "Hey all! I was accepted as a transfer junior for fall 2022 at FGCU and I'm planning to live on campus. I don't have anyone I plan to live with, but I'm planning to choose to live with 2-4 people I'm put with in housing. Which places are the best to live at? I was looking at North Lake Village because it seems like it is right next to the beach and there's a lot to do. I was also wondering if anyone knows what's the best option for living with students who are older and aren't freshman. Any advice?",

            "comment": "North lake is the best imo but if you\u2019re a transfer the school might try to push you into South village. It isn\u2019t bad by a long shot but there\u2019s better. North Lake is the only on campus housing with a full, in dorm kitchen which is a HUGE plus when you\u2019re hungry at 3 am, it\u2019s close to main campus, close enough you could walk to main campus in like 10 minutes and it has multiple shuttle paths going through it just in case your legs are tired. It\u2019s also way cheaper lol",

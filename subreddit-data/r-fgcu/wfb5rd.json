Obviously a lot has changed since my time departed, but here\u2019s what I can share: it is competitive. When my Community Health cohort went to apply for the MOT, there was 32 of us, 32 of us that all went to the same Community Health courses and all prepped together. 28 of 32 was denied. The (obvious) majority of those who were accepted into MOT, were not Fgcu grads. \n\nObviously take it with a grain of salt, and I strongly encourage you to speak to someone who actually got their MOT from Fgcu, but let me tell you, 6 years later im still mad at Fgcu choice to not prioritize their grads at all.",

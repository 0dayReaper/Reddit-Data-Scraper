I know some have decently bad input delay.\n\nFor North Lake there is Eagle's Landing, which has a TV or two, as well as a computer room, or conference room for bringing own setups.\n\nFor West Lake, there's the community center which has a TV, though I'd recommend the own rooms.\n\nFor main campus, there are several clubs that host gaming events, which I can post more about if you'd like.",

That kind of makes it to where only people who have planned to play ahead of time with friends go there. Do you know if any of the places you listed come with setups?",

    "postText": "Hi! This sublease is for an ALL WOMEN unit at The Reef. I realize I am very late posting this, but I had a very sudden change in plans caused by a life situation that I\u2019d rather not talk about.  I haven\u2019t moved in or picked up my keys so I know nothing about the condition of the room. However, the other women living in the unit haven\u2019t complained about anything so I am assuming that all the rooms are in great condition. \n\nThe rent for the unit is $802 and there are a few fees they will expect you to pay, totaling about $1002. I already paid the room deposit so you will not be required to pay that and they currently aren\u2019t charging late fees. If you really need the housing and have at least HALF of the $1002, I am willing to help you out by paying the other half. Please get in touch with me asap by sending me a Private Message thank you!",

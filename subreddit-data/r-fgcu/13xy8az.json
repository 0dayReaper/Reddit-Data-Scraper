It is too risky to sit and wait and hope a room opens up, unfortunately. Besides, FGCU would probably put you in an overflow dorm, and those typically have 2-4 people per bedroom depending on the demand. After Ian, a lot of people had their graduation dates pushed back so they are staying for another year, plus many off-campus housing options raised their prices; that\u2019s why there was an unprecedented number of students looking for on-campus housing this year. Best of luck to you!",

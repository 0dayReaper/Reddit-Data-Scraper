    "postText": "Hello, I am in my last year of Hillsborough Community College and I\u2019m deciding if I should transfer to FGCU. The reason why I\u2019m thinking about FGCU is because I know a few people on campus and I\u2019ll have a better social life, but it\u2019ll be more expensive because I\u2019ll be living on campus. I\u2019ve been to the campus, and loved it. Can you please give me some pros and cons of FGCU please. Thank you for the help.",

            "comment": "I transferred from UCF to FGCU. I\u2019m majoring in bio pre-professional and interested in lab work so this is just my experience. \n\nPros: \n1. Class sizes are hella small so you will get to know your teachers. This will help if you\u2019re pursing grad school, asking for letters of recommendation is a piece of cake. \n2. A lot of science classes are combined lab/lecture so you do lab work pertaining exactly to what you\u2019re learning in class \n3. Smaller campus means no waiting for hours for financial aid or the registrar office to help you \n4. Just my experience but the teachers/advisors here are A LOT more helpful and available to you\n\nSome bad stuff.\n\nCons: \n1. If you\u2019re looking for the \u201creal\u201d college experience, it\u2019s not really going to happen as much here. Fort Myers is t exactly as cool as Miami or Orlando for example \n2. If you\u2019re looking at Greek life, you don\u2019t have as many options here \n3. Library is SMALL as hell so if you\u2019re looking to find a place to study, sometimes it\u2019s impossible. \n\nI\u2019m graduating this semester though so if you have any other questions you can DM me if you\u2019d like!",

            "comment": "Hey buddy glad to you transfer to FGCU I went to USF my freshmen year and transferred during COVID and going in my junior year as a FGCU student. I guess if you want less distraction to focus on your school then  that\u2019s great, besides that there\u2019s not a lot of things you can do on your free time here like u can in tampa or Orlando. Overall the school is nice and clean. It\u2019s a smaller university but it\u2019s more spread out and ecofriendly oriented. It used to be more nice and peaceful but there\u2019s more student on the campus now so parking is a slight issue when it\u2019s high traffic. There\u2019s prolly less 10 building here and they\u2019re in the spot that you would expect them to so I would probably take you a week or less to remember your classroom. And your major could partially decide if you will have a good time here as well. I wish you the best and have good semester.",

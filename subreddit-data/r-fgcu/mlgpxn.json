    "postText": "Hi I'm an incoming freshman and I heard from other students that a RoomSync link was sent out to students to help find roommates for the upcoming school year, but I haven't received any. I called housing and they told me to wait and call back after 24 hours. But I did and they just redirected me to RoomSync's main line but no one answered. I submitted my housing application a few months back and they confirmed that everything was good on my end.\n\nDid anyone get an email with the RoomSync link or are they still being sent out? Has anyone else been experiencing the same issue? Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!",

    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all, real quick question. \n\nDo you graduate Manga Cum Laude based off of your overall GPA or your institute GPA? Since I\u2019m a transfer student my overall GPA is a bit below MCL but my institutional FGCU GPA is well within MCL range. \n\nI can\u2019t seem to find it anywhere and the advisors I\u2019ve asked don\u2019t know either. \n\nThanks to whoever answers!",

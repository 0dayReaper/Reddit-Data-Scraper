    "postText": "So I'm looking at FGCU as my plan C for nursing school, I already got denied by EFSC even if I was in the 98th percentile nationally for the TEAS in science and 87th in math. I didn't do good on the reading, but I'm dislexic. \n\nNow I really have no idea why I got denied because I had a B in micro biology, A in A&amp;P 1 and 2, and a A in chemistry. My GPA is a 3.30 because I struggle in mathematics. I only had 3 C my entire time in college and   one was in statistics, college algebra (my professor sucked) and in Com 1. Everything else were B's and A's. \n\nSo I'm very, very concerned I'll never get into any nursing programs at all now. Plus I don't think they want a student who had a TBI and has CRPS, it's dumb.  I'm functional and have done all of my classes without accomodations because both my conditions are not in the DSM. \n\nSo yeah, I'm just done at this point. \n\nBTW my TEAS was a 72%.",

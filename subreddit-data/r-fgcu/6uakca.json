Here are some fast resources that are mostly useful to first-year students. If you have any questions, please ask them in this thread and someone will likely answer!\n\n----\n\n#Links: \n[Week of Welcome Schedule](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?showTitle=0&amp;showPrint=0&amp;showTabs=0&amp;showCalendars=0&amp;showTz=0&amp;mode=AGENDA&amp;height=600&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23FFFFFF&amp;src=fgcuwow%40gmail.com&amp;color=%231B887A&amp;ctz=America%2FNew_York) \n\n&gt; Many of these events are very fun and a wonderful way to meet new people. I personally recommend Casino Night, the Block Party, and any and all events that include free food. Even if you\u2019re busy, swing in, grab the food and swing out. \n\n[Move-In Week Dining Hours](https://www.dineoncampus.com/files/images/f6aff736-6a9f-49ed-bfb9-2a5db6a07491.jpg)\n\n[Regular Dining Hours](https://www.dineoncampus.com/files/images/598bc205-29e9-4b5d-9979-f12da1732c05.jpg)\n\n[List of Software Available On-Campus, With Locations](http://aets.fgcu.edu/files/Available-software.pdf)\n\n---\n\n#Fast Information\n\n###Campus Services\n\n####**Dining Payment:**\n\n* Cash\n\n* Debit/Credit: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover\n\n* Eagle ID Card: **Dining Dollars, Eagle Dollars**\n\n####**Laundry Payment:**\n\n* Quarters\n\n* Eagle Dollars\n\n####**On-Campus Printing Payment:**\n\n* Eagle Dollars\n\n---\n\n#### **Library Services Overview**\n\nLibrary Printing Prices:\n\n* Black &amp; White: $0.06/page\n\n* Color: $0.30/page\n\nLibrary-Available Services:\n\n* 3 Scanning Machines (Free to use)\n\n* ~250 Windows 10 Computers \n\n     &gt;All with Maple, Microsoft Office 2016, and Respondus Lockdown Browser\n\n* 10 Mac Minis (OS X Yosemite)\n\n* Paid Printing; Double-Sided Available\n\n* A Small Lab With Premium Specialty Software (A/V Editing, CAD, etc.) \n\n* Computing Support Desk for all Library Services as well as student computers.\n\n---\n\n###Campus Computing Assistance\n\n**All Housing Network Problems**\n\n* Call the BTS Helpdesk @ (239)590-1188, OR go to Griffin Hall RM 252.\n\n     &gt; Open Monday-Friday, 7:30AM - 5:00PM\n\n**Other Laptop Support**\n\n* The BTS Helpdesk performs Malware Removal and supports student emails, Canvas, Gulfline and Student Websites (Information Systems Class)\n\n* The FGCU Library assists with Malware Removal and general laptop troubleshooting. This service is great because it is open for all hours that the library is open. \n\n---\n\n##FAQs\n\n&gt;What is the difference between Eagle and Dining (FLEX?) Dollars?\n\n* Dining dollars are used in all campus dining locations, such as Chik-Fil-A and SoVi. Eagle Dollars are a general account used for payment across campus. They can be used in the bookstore, for printing, for laundry and also for dining. Within dining locations, it is important to specify if you would to use Eagle Dollars, as Dining dollars are the default.\n\n&gt; I can't get online in housing.\n\n* You must complete a check and register your system using the Bradford Persistent Agent to use the housing network. Requirements include having antivirus software. Visit resnet.fgcu.edu for more information. WiFi in the main campus does **not have any requirements for access.**\n\n&gt; My internet sucks. What do I do?\n\n* All rooms on campus should have ethernet ports for directly connecting to the network. If you don't have one, check with your housing desk to see if they provide them free of charge. \n\n&gt; Is it worth it to get a meal plan?\n\n* My opinion is NO. If you wish to save money in the long run, learn to cook for yourself, even if that means nothing but salads and microwaved meals. I recommend buying a small frying pan, cutting board, knife and even a rice cooker to start off. Check out /r/EatCheapandHealthy or /r/BudgetFood for recipe ideas. Campus Dining recently switched to a new management company (Compass) and their operations are a clusterfuck. The less you commit or deal with them, the better. The only potentially useful meal plan is the \"Unlimited Membership Plan\" which works alright if you want to eat most of your meals at the South Village cafeteria. \n\n&gt; Ayy bruh I wanna party and get fucked up and shit\n\n* Moderate your drinking or you'll pass out in the SoVi lobby and be carted away in an ambulance while everyone not involved laughs at you for your lack of self control. Go somewhere else to smoke weed or everyone in the hall will hate you. \n\n---\n\nIf you're reading this within three or four days of this being posted, you have a ton of time to prep for classes, which resume Monday, August 21st. Take that time to familiarize yourself with the campus layout, as well as services you think you'll need. During the weekend, the Library may be the only operating non-dining location on campus.\n",

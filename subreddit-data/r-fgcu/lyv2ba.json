(Ex-Bio major btw, left because I didn\u2019t wanna go to med school). Look up Genetic Counselors it might dissuade you from not going to grad school.\n\nTeaching is always an option and Stem educators are VERY HIGH NEED (I Plan to teach Bio in HS but teaching isn\u2019t for everyone!)\n\nRemember Biology is one of the MOST POPULAR MAJORS. It\u2019s not the worst job market and having that B.S lines you up for research very nicely, but there\u2019s so many other undergrads who graduate and give up on being doctors so the field is saturated.",

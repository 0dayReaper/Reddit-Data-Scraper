    "postText": "Is there any way to get prerequisites for a class waived? I do not have the prerequisites, as the class is hard to come by and my college does not offer it and I was never able to take it anywhere else because it did not fit in my schedule/was not online. However courses I have taken for my major have prepared me for this class. Any advice? I really need this course and I really need it next semester:/",

I ended up going to my professors for advisement and they helped me quite enthusiastically.\n\nI somehow ended up taking a class that I should have taken after an into class, and the intro class was basically covered in that class, and I was able to get it waived.",

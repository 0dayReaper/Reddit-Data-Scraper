There are, like, four professors so you get to build a relationship with them. If you have interest in the course material, I can\u2019t recommend it enough. However, the classes can be tough, and this major does require an internship to graduate. If you\u2019re seriously considering it, then I recommend a meeting with Dr. Srivastava, the department head.",

I didn\u2019t like the people there at all, financial aid is a joke, the class sizes are massive so you\u2019ll never get to know your teachers for a letter of recommendation (that\u2019s what happens when you have like 60,00 students), out of the 3 advisors that I had only 1 genuinely helped me. 1 mocked me for switching majors (went from bio to health science). On another occasion with another advisor, I was trying to set up my schedule for the next semester and whenever I would ask her questions about certain classes/teachers, she would constantly say \u201cidk, what would you wanna do?\u201d Like idk bitch, that\u2019s why I asked you a question, this is your job. \n\nIf you\u2019re not into drinking every weekend and tailgating, it\u2019ll be a bit harder to make friends. I know that\u2019s most colleges but this one seemed to take the cake. Living in Orlando is just EXPENSIVE. EXPENSIVE. EXPENSIVE. Again, I know that\u2019s the case with most student housing but here, I have plenty of friends that live around/off campus and they pay around 2/3 what I paid there and they get a shit ton more bang for their buck here. \n\nI\u2019m not saying FGCU is perfect, but every single issue I experienced at UCF has not happened to me here, by a long shot. At UCF, everything is a competition and everyone is trying to drag you down so they can get ahead. Here, people actually try to fucking help you whether you\u2019re doing fantastic or you suck at what you\u2019re doing. \n\n(That was super long but that was just my personal experience! I have friends that \u201cbleed gold and black\u201d but like, that school sucks major dick)",

For example, I know plenty of people who despise UF and plenty of people who love it. FSU, USF, etc. It goes the same with all of them! Hell, I\u2019m even trying to go back to UCF to get my masters (due to location and job opportunities with what I\u2019m interested in). \n\nWhat I wish I would\u2019ve done was gone to FGCU first, completed my bachelors, then gone to a bigger school for my masters program! I just like FGCU more because of the smaller class sizes, I have 2 letter of recommendation under my belt from professors who actually know me and my strengths, and I\u2019m doing research with the school as well! All of that after only being here for like a year and a half. \n\nI also didn\u2019t care about the \u201ccollege experience\u201d that so many people go through. Don\u2019t care about football, don\u2019t care about going downtown, don\u2019t care about lecture halls, the stuff that gets emphasized in movies/TV. Does FGCU have that? Yes, but not to the extreme that bigger schools like UF, UCF, FSU, etc. All have. It\u2019s all personal preference :)",

Also I can\u2019t learn this way\n\nIf I wanted to do zoom I would have stayed at home this semester. I fully acknowledge the risks going to campus everyday and I\u2019m fine with it. For the people who are afraid of it so much have them stay at home. Boom, solved \n\nI mean as long as everyone wears a mask and practices social distance we\u2019re fine right.

You also inadvertantly are putting the surrounding area (which is full of old people and at risk populations) in jeopardy. Also if you're struggling in zoom classes maybe you should wonder why you're even in higher education if you can't be an independent learner and take initiative.",

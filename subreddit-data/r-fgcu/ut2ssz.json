Osprey and Eagle are both newer, and since Osprey was closest to the pool, dining, and garage I'd say that is prob the best in SoVi.\n\nBiscayne was fine, and I imagine Palmetto and Everglades were similair inside. \n\nThe bus to campus picked up outside Palmetto (idk if it still does) and Everglades was closer to the parking lots and dining so if you care about those points I'd rate in order, prob:\n\nOsprey \nEagle\nPalmetto\nEverglades\nBiscayne\n\nHope this helps \ud83e\udd17",

I lived in Palmetto and loved rolling out of bed and getting on the bus within like 10 minutes or walking to class (palmetto is the closest to campus other than biscayne). If you want more space outside of your dorm room, definitely go with eagle or osprey. All dorm rooms are the same size though, and eagle and osprey are the hardest to get in to.",

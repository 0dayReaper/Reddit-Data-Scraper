It doesn't really matter except for being able to start major-related classes earlier, but you can still knock out gen-eds pretty quickly if you're smart about registration. I started with zero credits and I'm a sophomore now, but I'll be taking major classes in the spring.",

Most ppl I know that do have college credit don't actually have enough to skip a whole year, it just saves them from taking a few classes here and there. If you have credit, great, if u don't you'll be fine.",

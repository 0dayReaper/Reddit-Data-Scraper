But if I do end up getting in I will be looking for roommates. I am a fan of a neat living space. My mother isn\u2019t exactly the cleanest in the kitchen so I like to arrange all the snacks and shelves, aswell as the fridge and counters. I always keep my room and bathroom clean and organized. Everything has a place on my desk. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not insanely picky and not everything has to be right 100% if the time but generally everything is in its own little spot.",

They have a separate housing community for freshmen, south lake village (sovi) where you will end up living, and an upperclassman community, north lake. Kinda sucks but best of luck to you, I\u2019ve found it difficult to find others with an organized mentality when it comes to living spaces and it drives me a liiiiiittle crazy hahaha! Hope it all works out for you my friend!",

Like how are the professors, the material, networking and just overall how good the business school is. Any info would be very much appreciated!",

Half the kids in the business school are there for a quick degree and will do the bare minimum sitting in class on their laptops barely paying attention etc. But if you\u2019re in the small percentage that is going to try to get to know your professors, try to learn and understand the material and work hard, you\u2019re going to stick out to those professors like a sore thumb, and they WILL NOTICE. Classes are small so professors actually know my name which is amazing. I was told professors are 50/50 good or bad but in my experience the professors I have had are extremely passionate and willing/happy to work with you! Every professor has office hours a few days a week. Like I said it\u2019s what you make of it, if you\u2019re looking for a school to get a good education and to learn a lot, as long as you are willing to put in the effort FGCU is great.... but don\u2019t be surprised when half the class is chegging, cheating on exams, or begging for the homework in group chats.",

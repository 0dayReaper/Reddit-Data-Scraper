    "postText": "I come from a low-income household, so, when it comes to colleges, affordability is a big thing for me. I'm hoping to not take out any loans if at all possible because that would probably only put more stress on me. How affordable was this university for you guys? If you are also from a low-income household, how much money in financial aid were they willing to give you? Is this school more affordable than other Florida universities? What scholarships does the school offer?",

I got out with zero loans. If you can drive and are a resident, it\u2019s way more affordable to live in Bonita springs or Cape Coral and commute. \n\nEdit to add: I found the school affordable and it\u2019s only going to be worth it if you put the work in. I developed amazing relationships with professors and staff so it was a great value for me.",

Earning bright futures also puts you in the running for admissions merit scholarships(APPLY EARLY TO RECEIVE THESE) \n\nWith FL Bright Futures you\u2019re left to only pay housing and meal plans IF you choose to purchase those. It\u2019s not mandatory. \n\nMy Freshman year I had all tuition covered by bright futures and a $2,500 scholarship each semester that went towards housing and my meal plan. My first year my parents paid only $600 out of pocket to send me to FGCU. The most affordable University in the state in my opinion. PM me if you wanna talk more",

The FGCU foundation is a big source of these, as private scholarship donors help out anyone in need of financial aid. I also have a music scholarship since I am a member of the program. And a tuition waiver, Bright futures, and the Pell Grant. If you are dedicated to your education and can maintain a good gpa above a 3.0 you should be able to get similar assistance. I am even awarded more for satisfactory progress such as a 4.0 semester grade. Also look into Trip Support services (SSS), a program tailored for first generation and low-income students at FGCU. They offer amazing mentoring, supplies, tutoring, and scholarships as well.",

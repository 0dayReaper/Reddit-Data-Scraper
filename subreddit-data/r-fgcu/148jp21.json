    "postText": "I am going into my sophmore year of college and I plan on transferring to fgcu either the second semester or the start of my junior year. Couple questions, \n1. Would rushing a frat as a second semester sophmore/first sem junior matter for me if I was trying to do Greek life?\n2. Is Greek life even worth it? \n3. I DJed in high school and now Dj at multiple bars in college, any suggestions on bars I should contact to try to dj at, any bars that thier current dj is brutal? Lol",

            "comment": "Most people that rush are freshmen. You could still join a frat without going through the rush process. I know a lot of people that love greek life and a lot that don\u2019t, but it\u2019s definitely something you should look into if you are interested. It can look good on graduate school applications, especially if your frat does a lot of philanthropy work and/or you hold a specific position. As far as DJing goes, there are quite a few bars to work with; Keys is by far the most popular. A couple frats look for DJ\u2019s regularly for parties as well. If you rush, that would be a great opportunity to introduce yourself to them and try to snag a gig.",

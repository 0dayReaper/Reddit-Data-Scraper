Nobody should be embarrassed of their own color, ethnicity, religion, etc.\n\nHowever, I don't see what this accomplishes.\n\nIt wasn't like the school condoned it or shrugged their shoulders about it; they took action!\n\nWhat at you protesting? 1 dumb person who doesn't even come close to speaking for 1% of FGCU students?\n\n",

I don't defened the people that do this, but was a email to the entire campus NEEDED?\n\nplease don't think I'm siding with anyone or trying to dispute this, Simply asking was it needed? \n",

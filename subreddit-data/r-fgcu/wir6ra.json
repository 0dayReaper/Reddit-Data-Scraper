I haven\u2019t heard anything about the nursing school at FGCU and I\u2019m transferring so idk anything about the school itself. \nIs the information overwhelming?\nAre the professors well suited to teach? \nIs it easy to talk to professors? \nIs it easy to communicate with other nursing students?\nI\u2019ll appreciate any info! :)",

Nursing school is going to be tough, just being honest, and it\u2019ll be like that wherever you go for nursing school. There\u2019s a ton of information to learn, and being a BSN program means there\u2019s also lots of writing to do spread throughout the program in different courses. The information can be overwhelming if you let it be overwhelming, so I highly suggest you tackle it head on ASAP and don\u2019t wait to let it accumulate to overwhelm you. It\u2019s going to mean studying and reviewing content a lot and may mean you miss a lot of social events in the interim. Not to say you won\u2019t have any free time, because you will, but again it comes down to how well you study and organize your time.\n\nThe professors seem to have only gotten better since I left, though there are some professors that aren\u2019t as well suited to teach. Again, you\u2019ll find that anywhere. While they may mean well, the manner in which they do so may be anything but pleasant. However, it is fairly easy to talk to your professors inside and outside the classroom, just remember to be courteous and such obviously. Communicating with the other nursing students depends on how you and they are as individuals. Try to find out early students that will have similar mindsets, study habits, and that you generally get along well with and it\u2019ll help you click with them. These people will be the ones you\u2019ll be studying alongside and spending a rather decent chunk of almost two years with, so you want to be careful about picking the right people lol.\n\nThe program is great, and I\u2019m thankful for it. It\u2019s prepared me and all my fellow classmates for great things. From what I\u2019ve seen in the hospital setting and now as an RN having seen students come, FGCU students tend to be some of the better clinical students than other schools, generally speaking, but of course it can\u2019t be said for every single student. Lots of former BSN graduates choose to return to FGCU for graduate programs and a lot can be said about that. \n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any other questions, or try searching nursing posts here in the FGCU subreddit for commonly asked questions.",

For the BSN program there\u2019s adult clinicals, pediatric, obstetric, mental health, and community health clinical sites. I can DM the list I remember to you, though each student could be at various locations depending on the course.",

If your kid likes the water we have multiple water sports teams and a fishing club if they enjoy that! The most important thing is to look for what you want and go for it!",

The pool and waterfront are hot spots to hangout. Spearfishing club has a bunch of people in it and is pretty fun! I know they do get togethers and such. There are a ton of clubs too. Make sure your kid lives on campus in SOVI. Three bedroom or two bedroom would be best, that way they immediate have someone to adventure with on campus! I also recommend them joining the facebook and instagram pages (i.e., FGCU class of 2026) to help them find a roommate or just some friends! I had a wonderful time during my years at FGCU, it is what you make of it for sure.",

And being in state would be substantially cheaper tuition per credit hour.  Also, I imagine you'd need to fly to and from the school multiple times a year which would add up.  If he really wants to have fun at college, I'd look into a bigger school that has a town or city built around them.  And I'd likely just choose the nearest D1 university to where you are.  \n\nFGCU has grown a lot since I went there, but it's still surrounded by subdivisions and swamps and probably lacks the \"fun\" he'll be looking for compared to a larger school.",

It was a commuter school when I was there, but I really have no way to judge or tell how it stands now since they have way more dorms.  There is a greek system, but it's not like what you'd expect from a more established school or what you expect from movies.\n\nIf you want a better \"college experience\" in Florida, I'd look into University of Florida or Florida State to start as they are the oldest and most established.  But if you google universities in Florida, you'll see a ridiculous list of options that would probably be just as good with some research.  But UF and FSU are probably the best for \"having fun\".  They have tons more students and tons more activity because of it.  At FGCU you can't walk off campus and have a whole town at your disposal.  Sure, it's a quick tram ride to Gulf Coast Town Centre or the Outlet Malls, but it's not the same as walking to Tennessee street in Tallahassee from your dorm, or even University Ave in Gainesville and having EVERYTHING you'd need.  \n\nOutside of Florida, if you want business schools, I'd look into University of Texas in Austin.  It'll certainly get you out of the cold and put you in a tech hub city.  That would be a lot of options for internships and entry level positions.  Other choices on my list would be Georgia Tech in Atlanta and University of Carolina, Charlotte.  There are plenty of other good schools in other major cities that would have ample opportunities, but those are what come to my mind first.\n\nHappy hunting.",

What are their reps?\n\nHave some visits etc, son #1 is Miami FL, a reach, so trying to check out some backups.  Thanks for your Florida insights.",

Orlando has a pretty decent bus system compared to the rest of the state, so that helps with getting around.  I know a lot of people that went there, but I have only visited the campus once so I don't know too much.\n\nAs for USF, for a long time it was the biggest commuter school.  I'm not sure if it still is, but they have added tons of dorms and such in the last 20 years so it has likely changed.  The main campus is technically in Temple Terrace which is a suburb of Tampa and a bit of a drive to downtown Tampa.  There is still plenty of stuff around and a big enough student population to have fun.  USF has two satellite campuses.  I think it used to have more which became schools of their own and is why I believe it is considered a commuter school.  I really like University of South Florida's St. Pete campus.  It's right on the water just south of downtown.  If I had to choose colleges again, it would be in my top 3, though I live just on the other side of Tampa Bay from it, so proximity would also be part of that decision.\n\n\nInstead of me doing write ups, it's probably best just to get it from Wikipedia:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_Florida",

Are there any major cons about the school that jump out to you? I\u2019m planning to major in Elementary Ed, with a minor in Theatre. Is there anything in particular I should know before I apply early decision? \n\nThank you :)",

Even though it is a smaller student population, it's enough that the campus never feels empty (yet not crowded) and the class sizes let the professor get to know you as a person and not a number. \n\nLike any school, if you don't take advantage of the resources or don't put in the effort and are just looking to party, you might not like it here. But if you're here to prepare for your career and meet lots of new people, I would highly recommend.  \n\nThe only cons I can think of are the lack of parking spaces and how stressful course registration can be.",

Went there once, took what they told me to take, ended up getting out of sync with my required classes and had to take an extra semester to take one single class. My professors were pissed, complained to the dean, and now they advise students themselves (as apparently this had happen many times before). Point to this story is, always triple check your classes and even check in with your profs before you sign up.",

It\u2019s definitely not UF, FSU, etc but hey it\u2019s a degree \n\n\nThe con is that we don\u2019t have a football and we should get one. It feels not like the regular college experience without the football and tailgates and etc \n\n\nEdit: Another pro is the dorms they are nice, however the housing department are a bunch of pricks. FGCU is gray if you want to get an *accredited* university and provides a valuable piece of paper that doesn\u2019t mean you learnt what you wanted to learn but it\u2019s a degree that\u2019s shows your future employer you payed enough money to attend a *accredited* university and shows you cared enough to attend classes and do assignments. \n\nBecause in the end what college/ university is about is getting a leg up saying you are capable of small amount of responsibility of doing class and such \nJust my two cents",

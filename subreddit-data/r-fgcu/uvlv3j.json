    "postText": "I just transferred into FGCU from ucf and I got into north lake. I just realized however that I\u2019ll be sharing a room with another person, since I was assigned in the quad layout. I start in August and I was hoping I would be able to transfer rooms to layout with my own bedroom. I don\u2019t see the option on the housing portal though, and I was hoping someone would know where to go to do that. Any help is appreciated!",

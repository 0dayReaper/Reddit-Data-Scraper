Professors care way more about teaching since research isn\u2019t their first priority and the lack of grad students for more departments allow tons of opportunities for undergrads to do research/TA.\n\nUSF nightlife is odd, the campus is in a shitty area. FGCU nightlife isn\u2019t as exciting but there\u2019s enough to do to keep it fun.",

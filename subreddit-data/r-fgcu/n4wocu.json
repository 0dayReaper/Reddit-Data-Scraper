    "postText": "Hi, I'm the owner of a local dry cleaner and I was wondering if any students at FGCU would have any interest in a free pick-up &amp; delivery laundry / Wash &amp; Fold service? Pay as you go, order service whenever needed. We would pick-up on Tuesdays and deliver back 48 hours later (Thursdays).\n\nEDIT: To anyone interested in the service, please feel free to sign up at [www.MyGreenerCleaner.com](https://www.MyGreenerCleaner.com). Or contact me via email: LaFranceDC \\[at\\] gmail \\[dot\\] com.",

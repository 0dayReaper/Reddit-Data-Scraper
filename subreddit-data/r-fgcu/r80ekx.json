    "postText": "I\u2019ve been going to FGCU for three years and I love it. I only wish is that we had a football team. \n\nThis past week USF played UCF and it a thrilling win for UCF. My friend Nate went and he had a blast! If we could bring that energy to Ft. Myers it would be next level. We start off with just the basics, a regulation size football field. If we start now we can actually be a legitimate Division 1 and play teams like Georgia Southern, Miami (FL), USF, FAMU, FIU, Georgia Tech, and Tulane. Among dozens more \n\nI know what most people are thinking too. It\u2019s too expensive and costly for other money we could invest in other programs. But not really and this for two reasons. First is that we don\u2019t need a major budget fiasco. At the start all is need are two field goal posts and a regulation size field. And the soccer fields are perfect because we\u2019ll have moveable FG posts when soccer plays. This happens in many stadiums like  Gillette Stadium. We don\u2019t need the super expensive to start. We just need a regulation size football field, which isn\u2019t difficult. \n\nNow, our operation is small. But, there\u2019s a lot of potential for aggressive expansion. We have a total enrollment of 15,000+ students (2020). And of the thousands of students I\u2019m absolutely certain there are a group of 50 people that would join. \n\nAs someone who loves college football greatly and have been to a football university I know how amazing it can be.",

            "comment": "One of the biggest reasons FGCU doesn\u2019t have a football team and doesn\u2019t want a football team right now is because it wants to be known for other sports (Tennis, Soccer, Swimming for example we are a top school for in our division) and if football is brought on, some money from those sports will be diverted to football. They also don\u2019t want to use their funding to create a football field. Keep in mind FGCU is different and is trying to be different, this is why we are almost done with the water school. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc It would be cool if in a few years they could secure private funding for a football field, one day!",

            "comment": "I haven\u2019t seen anyone mention this yet so I wanted to add that Title 9 also has a play here. Title 9 requires that the D1 sports must reflect the gender population of the students. At FGCU, there are more female than male students, so it is required that there be more ladies teams than mens. If FGCU wants to add mens football as a D1 sport, it will either have to remove another mens team that already exists OR create 2 more ladies teams as well. And there simply isn\u2019t funding for that.\n\n\nAlso, President Martin would often point out that he didn\u2019t feel football was going to be a very profitable sport for much longer. He believes that due to the amount of possible injuries in football have led to less participants and fans of the sport. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s accurate or not, but as the person with the final decision, that\u2019s where his opinion lies.",

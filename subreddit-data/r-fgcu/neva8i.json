I found their tests very fair, but honestly, you just have to study almost everything because you never know what could be on the tests. A big way to study for the tests is to pay keen attention to what you learn in the lab, as that will always come back in some form to the lecture exams. Be very active and engaged in lab, and ask as many questions as you can think of. Additionally, have or make friends in other labs and talk with them as to what they learned. You would be surprised the number of times one lab group learned more than another, and that actually made a difference when it came to examsz",

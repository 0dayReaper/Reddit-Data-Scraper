            "comment": "All the carts you'll find sold around campus are fake and usually full of vitamin e and other poisonous stuff. Just smoke bud and the best way to cover the smell is to use a dry herb vaporizer like the Pax (can be found at local smoke shops).  Personally my friends were never afraid to smoke in the dorms as long as we put towels against the door and pillows in the vents and used sploofs. Smoking in the nature trails is also a good option, not a lot of people out there and it's super peaceful at night. Use ozium to cover the smell. Also just park somewhere out in the lots and smoke too, or the parking garage works as well.  Just don't be stupid and obvious and you should be ok. Best to do it late at night when there's not a lot of people. Most RAs won't give a shit and don't want to get involved. A legal alternative to bud that has carts and is safe is Delta 8. It's a cannabis derivative and you can find clean carts at various smoke and CBD shops or order it online",

I would say they keep everything sterile to a degree, but there would be times we wouldn't wash the lettuce if we are in a rush and dont have the time to clean it. The other thing would be cross contamination. Besides when making gluten free items, we hardly ever change our gloves even when moving onto different food items. The knife used to cut stuff isnt ever cleaned so you can expect a knife that cut chicken would later cut the lettuce.\n\nFor foods to get and not get, i would say go for burgers, chicken tenders,  and wraps (only in the begining of the day) however your being scammed by how much the food costs. No goes would be the pizza; it has never tasted good and some of the toppings rarely ever get replaced, and the grilled cheese; just buy your own ingredients its too expensive for cheese and bread.\n\nI have never known for someone to on purposely mess up someones food. The only thing i could think of is if your a dick you may get less fries depending on whos serving you.\n\nBeing a good customer is easy. Speak up when ordering, dont be an ass, and dont come in 20 min before closing.",

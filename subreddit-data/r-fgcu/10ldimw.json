    "postText": "I have heard so many mixed statistics regarding the likelihood of getting accepted into the BSN program or not. I had a rough first semester my freshman year (B\u2019s and a C in bio) but quickly got myself together and have gotten nothing but A\u2019s apart from 2 B\u2019s. I have A\u2019s in important courses like A&amp;P and microbiology. My GPA right now is a 3.57, and I got an 80.8 on my TEAS. I know it\u2019s super competitive, but can someone from the program give me some insight? I know people with similar stats and some got accepted, and some got rejected. I\u2019m worried my first freshman semester will potentially hold me back, even though my other grades are great. Any advice on how to not constantly fixate on this? \ud83d\ude05",

I remember I called to ask for statistics when I applied and they said they didn\u2019t have any because they accept a range of GPAs and TEAS scores. When I applied I had a ~3.8 GPA and 81 on the TEAS. It\u2019s a brutal wait, but good luck!",

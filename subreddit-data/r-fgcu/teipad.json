    "postText": "So, first question, do you think if I applied for fall housing in NLV that I would be able to get in?\n\nSecond question, I'm trans (recently out) and was wondering how to navigate housing and such? Like, will they automatically assign me housing based on my AGAB, or will I be with my gender that I identify? I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable, and I'm aware this is a very sensitive issue for some.",

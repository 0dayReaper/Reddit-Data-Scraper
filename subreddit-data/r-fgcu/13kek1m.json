Students admitted as upper-level transfers must complete 40 hours of service-learning as part of their graduation requirement.  FTIC students who have earned a Florida AA degree prior to matriculating at FGCU (through dual enrollment and accelerated credit) must complete 40 hours of service-learning as part of their graduation requirement.",

    "postText": "I took some courses for Summer A. I have a decent amount of tuition I still need to pay. I\u2019m still in the process of getting a private loan to pay the rest but its taking longer than expected. I know the fall semester is coming up soon. But if I don\u2019t get that paid in a week or so, will that affect anything regarding my falls semester? I haven\u2019t received any emails about it either. So Idk if i should be worried or not?? \n\n\nI had a similar situation Spring semester, but I had enough finical aid nothing got dropped. So I\u2019m hoping thats case for this upcoming semester.",

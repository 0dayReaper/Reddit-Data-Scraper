            "comment": "I'm a current freshman, and school is great. It's definitely growing, which is nice because you get all the perks of a \"small college\" without feeling like you're just a number. The location is nice too because pretty much everything you need is in one spot and everything else is within a 10-15 minute drive or so.\n In my experience, the professors have been absolutely wonderful so far, and they really want to help you succeed!! \n\nMy biggest tip would be that the school is what you make of it-- there's alot of events (especially after move-in) to socialize and plenty of ways to get involved, but if you don't put yourself out there or put effort into your classes, you might not enjoy it.\n\nIn regards to majors, there are extra benefits to attending if you are in nursing, business, or environmental studies, but I personally don't think it should be the sole reason not to attend. I'm in a major that is relatively new (public health), but I feel like I have a lot more opportunities for research because of how small it is, and it is easier to get to know the faculty. The only major downside I've noticed is the more niche your major, the less options for upper level classes",

            "comment": "it\u2019s a pretty good school, depending on your intended major. i\u2019m a freshman political science/history major and the classes are pretty limited. a few professors teach pretty much the same classes every semester. there\u2019s enough to graduate, but there isn\u2019t much room to study niche topics like you would get in a bigger school. if you\u2019re planning to do nursing, engineering, or environmental science, it should be a great school for you. the small class sizes are really nice so you get to have a more personal relationship with your professors. also the ft myers area kinda sucks lol. \n\nTLDR: it can be really awesome or only okay, depending on your major.",

I really appreciated that he told us that and I've since realized that that's the case for many of the Chem department. Ive had 4 Chem classes plus labs (7 professors in total) and would consider one of them a good educator. The other departments are like anywhere else, mix of great, good, meh, and bad.",

As others have mentioned there are departments that struggle to find good staffing, then there are departments that are some of the best most interesting people you\u2019ll ever talk to. \n\nI spent time living both on and off campus, I enjoyed being on campus because there\u2019s generally something going on all the time, but found ways to stay involved as well off campus. \n\nBeing from and staying in the area it\u2019s been wild watching campus grow and all the growth and development it\u2019s brought to Estero and the surrounding areas is insane.\n\nI think your mileage will vary depending on your degree path and how involved you choose to be; and definitely get involved, most of the people I know who hated their experience at FGCU did nothing to be part of the community.",

            "comment": "Hi! \n\nGraduated 2 years ago from a very small major (anthropology), and the one thing I will say about having a small major like that, is that you get to know everyone in it, including professors. You have the same professors several times over and I think that really helps to build a relationship. I've had nothing but positive experiences with professors and classes within my major. Only time I ever had problems was with classes outside.\n\nAlso as far as the gpa, you have 2 years to bring it up, and even if you don't, my gpa was like 3.25 at graduation and they let me in with no problem.\n\nGood luck man!",

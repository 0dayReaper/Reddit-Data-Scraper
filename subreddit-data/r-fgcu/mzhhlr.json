    "postText": "Hello my name is Mike,\n\nI\u2019m currently looking for some people who are tired of a 9-5 and would like to freely express ideas and information. \n\nThe objective is that we create some \u201cexperiments\u201d to test and relay information to one another. I fully believe that all of you who feel this way can simply change your life with the start of something new. \n\nI\u2019m not charging anyone for anything, I am simply asking if we can create a group that allows us to express the ideas we have that require less work than a 9-5 basis. \n\nIf you feel that you are motivated and willing to try things to become successful please, message me at your earliest convenience and let\u2019s start today! \n\nThank you for your time\n\nRegards, \nMichael Caceres",

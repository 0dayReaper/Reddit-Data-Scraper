Im taking a class at another school that counts as a required class for my major, but i'm getting a 60% in that class, which is passing at that school but i know its definitely not passing at fgcu. Does anyone know if fgcu will still take credit for that class or if i can do the satisfactory/unsatisfactory thingy? Thanks!",

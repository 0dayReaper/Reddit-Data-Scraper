    "postText": "hi guys, I didn't balance my work/study schedule out very well this semester and ended up dropping my pre-calc class this semester after Hurricane Ian and they extended the deadlines. I was able to sign up for MAC2311 because I feel that I can just move on and have friends taking the class rn, but im scared if the system will auto-drop me next semester for actually not meeting that pre-req.. are there any thoughts? ik the class is to prepare you but my pre-calc professor did flipped classroom where everything u need to learn is on youtube",

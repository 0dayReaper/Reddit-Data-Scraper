(which are annoying but I wear them) \n\nLiterally it\u2019s easy to stop the spread. I legitimately think some students at this school are morons. Go out to parties no social distancing. \n\n&gt; They just don\u2019t care.\n\nIt\u2019s not the university as much as it\u2019s the people in the university. The whole community needs a mindset change. Be mad at people who go out and party next to hundreds of people \n\nThat being said, the answer is NOT more restrictions. \n\nAn additional point is for 99% of the people who get it, they\u2019re sick for a week and they get better. \n\nI\u2019m fed up with all the restrictions. I follow them and so do my friends. But what good does it do if I follow rules but sororities/ frats/ brainless/ ditzy people don\u2019t follow the rules\n\nAll in all, hope for a tested vaccine to come into production soon. I think thats our best hope\n\nUpdate: \nAlso idk about y\u2019all but I haven\u2019t learned one darn lesson since we started having zoom/ online classes. It\u2019s coming to the point I\u2019m doing uni for the credits and not the education. \n\nAnd that\u2019s not fair. I\u2019m here to further my education. I\u2019ve learned nothing in any online classes.",

And even if people do recover, you can't just shit on your immunocompromised classmates and staff, many of whom are older. Or the surrounding community. Also, about zoom classes, I've been learning just fine in them and I actually really enjoy the freedom they offer me so I'm free from commutes and being stuck in a classroom. I'm a very independent and successful student, however.",

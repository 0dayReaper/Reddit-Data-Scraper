Everything is really spread out in this area so if you are partying off campus be VERY CAREFUL!! \nThere is no reliable rideshare either so you have to drive yourself or find a designated driver.",

If you\u2019re looking at Greek life parties there are 0, we don\u2019t have any of our houses on campus. Best you\u2019ll find would be if some people host stuff off campus. But, social life is pretty good. We have a buttload of events throughout the year, lots of free food/drinks/freebies. \n\nI\u2019d focus more on if the school has a good program with whatever degree you\u2019re interested in.",

Bars are poppin\u2019, always good crowds at Keys, Cantina, or Tiki. I also have friends who go to FAU and its about the same there too.",

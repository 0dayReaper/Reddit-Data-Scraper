[Here is the link to that program.](https://www.fgcu.edu/cas/departments/is/crew/cannabisstudies)\n\nWe also have a Cannabis Professional Certificate Program. Once again, I don't really know much about it. [Here's a link to that one as well.](https://www.fgcu.edu/academics/ced/cannabiscertificate/)\n\nI don't really know much honestly, and hopefully someone else here can help more, but I thought I would try and give some assistance.",

The major is nice, but honestly it sucks sometimes because they don\u2019t offer the cannabis courses every semester, so there\u2019ll be semesters where you take no cannabis courses. The best, is the new universities that are coming out with a Bachelors in Cannabis instead of an Bachelors in integrated studies with a focus in cannabis.",

They don\u2019t have their house on campus and it\u2019s not nearly as crazy/intense. \n\nMy best advice? The rank doesn\u2019t matter. Go in it with an open mind and with who you have the most connections. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the \u201chighest rank\u201d if you\u2019re miserable. \n\nIt\u2019s not necessary at all, better off joining a free club. Unless your goal is to get a leadership position in the group and add it to your resume. Even then, you can do that in any other club.",

I would make a list of pros and cons for each group you\u2019re considering and take into account things like mutual interests, philanthropy, and organization. At the end of the day, it\u2019s about which group is the most like minded to you.",

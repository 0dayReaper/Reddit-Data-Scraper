Gulf coast town center has good options and UV, but I would look for the healthy option wherever you eat(or just don\u2019t get fries and soda when you go out to eat). But best in my opinion is poke fusion or 3 pepper burrito",

If you're looking for on campus food you're kinda outta luck in terms of quality food lol, but out of them all, BYOB is the lesser of the evils, with brahma coming in at a close second.",

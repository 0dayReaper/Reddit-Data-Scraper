    "postText": "I teach at FGCU and make videos that I host on YouTube. The videos are ad-free to ensure a smooth learning experience. I use OBS studio and merge multiple sources in the video - my camera, tablet, monitor, etc. When I do all this, the system lags - so sometimes the tablet screen shows up a few microseconds after I write on it. Or sometimes, the audio lags. Can someone in this community help, look at my machine and help me out of this problem please? I have an LG Gram 17. FGCU tech support has been, as usual, unhelpful.",

I believe FGCU has an instructional design department that is meant to assist with these types of issues. They may be able to recommend (and in some cases provide) hardware and software for you.",

            "comment": "I've been teaching online for almost 5 years now (way before the pandemic - always prefered offline though). I've been using OBS for the last few years.\n\nThe lagging has everything to do with the specs of your PC/laptop. I used to work with Windows 10 and 8GB and that was okay-ish. 1 camera, 1 PowerPoint, and occasionally some screen sharing. But it lagged multiple times during sessions. Rebooting during breaks solved a lot. \n\nBut when I upgraded to 16 GB things rocketed. Smooth transitions, hardly any lagging, rebooting not required anymore.\n\nSo, please put as many RAM as possible in your device and upgrade (if necessary) from a HDD to a SSD.",

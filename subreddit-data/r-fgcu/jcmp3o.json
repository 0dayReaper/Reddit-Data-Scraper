Probably a few reasons why that's not a useful statistic, but I wanted to help visualize what's going on. \n\nOf note is that cases *always* dip dramatically on weekends, skewing the data. This is likely due to lack of personnel reviewing reports over the weekends, or due to people not reporting during weekends due to lack of classes or employment.",

    "postText": "My daughter is a senior in high school and just visited your beautiful campus. We were surprised at how quiet it was with 14,000ish students enrolled.  We visited on Monday at 11 and the campus was pretty deserted. She had her heart set on FGCU but after visiting is afraid it will be hard to make friends since people weren\u2019t really out and about. I guess I\u2019m just hoping to get a better picture of campus life. Could it have been a Monday morning thing?  Is it hard to meet people and make friends?\nThanks so much for any insight you can provide!! \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "Around specific times campus can seem empty. If you're there early in the morning or when ppl are typically in class then your not going to see many people walking around. But if youre out between 11-2 it gets really busy, especially times when classes get out. So like after minute 15, 30, or 45. For example, around 1:15 you will see a lot of people walking around. There's definitely people there, but you have to think about the number of people that have classes online, or classes only 2-3 days a week. No student is ever on campus 24/7.",

Here is what i think: \n\nOf coursw fgcu is way smaller compare to other uni such as usf or ucf, hence making friend will depend A LOT on the career path and hobbies. \n\nWhat i mean by career path? Fgcu med-bio-or related major will have easy times making friend because the majority students here are in those major. On the other hand, stusents in engineer/computer/math/\u2026 wil have the harder time. I major in cs so i\u2019m sure about this point :-) \n\nHobbies? I mean it\u2019s a hit or miss. Join clubs and stuff like that will help. I spend most on my time on working and studying so i never experienced this. \n\nI\u2019ve lived in Fort Myers for 3 years, but being a minority, i have a hard time making friend here somehow. I travel a lot, go to educational events, and make many great friends, but not here. I just know swfl sucks for me, and I\u2019m getting out. \n\nGood luck!",

It really is a very active campus. There\u2019s a student club or organized activity for just about any interest or hobby or whatever she\u2019s in to\u2026. 14k is a low number I think FGCU\u2019s up around 15k+ now.",

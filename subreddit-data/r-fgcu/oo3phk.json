    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nI'm a recent graduate that is new to the area and want to understand the FGCU area to perhaps do some professional networking. My question is: Do most students at FGCU go home for the summer or do they usually stay in Estero?Also, Do FGCU grads usually stay in Estero for jobs or find jobs elsewhere? My initial impression is that most students  go home for the summer and that most move away from the FGCU area for jobs after they graduate, but let me know if this is incorrect.",

I\u2019d say about 80% of all FGCU students are in-state so most of them go back to their families \n\nMiami, Sarasota, Orlando, and Jacksonville &amp; Broward county are where most of students reside \n\nSome do live in the Ft. Myers/ Naples area who commute",

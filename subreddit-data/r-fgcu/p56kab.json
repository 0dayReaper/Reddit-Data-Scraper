    "postText": "I\u2019m a student entering the nursing program for the fall 2021 semester. My main concern is showing up in the right attire for my classes. I hear the scrubs you buy are to be worn for only clinical and labs. Are there any classes you\u2019re allowed to wear regular clothes? They required me to buy military khaki colored work plants also, and they also mentioned that there will be a nursing polo we will be receiving\u2014what do I wear those for? \n\nIf anyone is in the FGCU BSN program already that can clear this up, it\u2019s be great! Thank you in advance",

    "postText": "Im really stuck on which meal plan to get. The 7 Meals+600 flex or the 1200 Flex. I don't eat that much so there's no need for 7+meals per week. Can anyone give me info about the flex dollars. Do I swipe it a sovi dinning like a debit card? This question also goes for another restaurant on campus. I start in the fall btw\n\nmeal plan. typo my bad",

            "comment": "Flex is basically an amount of money you can spend on food, the meals plan isn\u2019t worth it since it limits meal swipes per day and per a certain time that I\u2019m pretty sure flex doesn\u2019t. Basically, 1200 flex could be viewed as 1200$ you only have for the restaurants, based on cost it might just be cheaper to just\u2026spend the money directly rather than buy a plan",

THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY. extra flex does roll over from fall to spring, but thats it. if you plan on eating almost exclusively on campus, not horrible considering it waives tax\n\nwhy i recommend waiting: they usually do a mid semester package of a much lower flex dollar amount (i think its like $250?) that also comes with a shitload of free coupons. imo its a pretty reasonable amount of flex dollars, and if you run short its not the end of the world to pay-as-you-go for a small tax that youd run like everywhere else",

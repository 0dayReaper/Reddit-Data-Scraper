    "postText": "So for my Birthday recently I got a Nintendo Switch to play games like Mario Kart and Smash with my friends, and while it can connect to the housing Wifi I'm still unable to play games like Smash Ultimate online. I've tried doing the game console registration but it wouldn't let me register it as a console. It did let me register it as a computer/smartphone/tablet but I still can't connect or play online games with it. Is there anyway to fix it or make it so I can play online? Thanks",

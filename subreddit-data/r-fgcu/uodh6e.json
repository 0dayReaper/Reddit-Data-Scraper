    "postText": "Should I be concerned by this? I know I have a tendency to freak out, but should I be concerned that one of my grades this semester is showing as an NR grade? I passed the class with a B, according to canvas, but idk. The professor never had class (that I'm aware of, maybe 5 times, and I went 3 of them), and when he did no attendance was ever taken.\n\nI just hope it doesn't turn into an F is all I'm concerned about really. Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you\n\nEdit: I have an advisor meeting on Tuesday, should I bring it up to them if it doesn't change?",

            "comment": "NR means that the professor hasn't put the grade into gulfline. I would email your professor about this and see what the issue is. If you haven't gotten a response from your prof by the time you have your advisor meeting, let your advisor know about the NR to see if they can contact the professor. If your professor doesn't enter the grade by a certain time then it will change to a failing grade. There was an email that is called \"End of Term Student Notification\" that was sent out (April 28) that explains most of what I just said.\n\nEdit: On the email it states that it will change to a failing grade within the following semester, so I couldn't tell you the exact date. But obviously, try to get the issue fixed sooner rather than later.",

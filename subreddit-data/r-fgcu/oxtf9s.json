    "postText": "FGCU wants to make you aware of our current face mask policy.\n\nWe would like students and employees to wear facial coverings while indoors and we recommend their use while attending crowded, outdoor events. Designated healthcare facilities are the only on-campus locations masks are currently required. These medical facilities, such as Student Health Services, have signage explaining mask-wearing expectations. \n\nOur mask policy is in tow with guidance from state law, the State University System of Florida and health agencies. Should we need to change the policy, all-campus alerts will be sent by email and text, shared on FGCU-branded social media accounts and posted to the [Protect The Nest website](https://www.fgcu.edu/coronaupdate).\n\nAs you make personal decisions about masks, please be aware that Southwest Florida is experiencing high levels of transmission and local hospitalization rates are spiking due to the aggressive spread of variants in our community.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that everyone, regardless of vaccination status, should wear face masks while indoors if they are in areas experiencing substantial or high transmission of the COVID-19 virus.",

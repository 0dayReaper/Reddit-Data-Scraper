It could happen obv but I\u2019ve got a little bit of hope",

And I don\u2019t want that \n\n\nI\u2019m trying to see how this is all gonna play out and wait on signing a lease but I\u2019m nervous. Maybe I\u2019ll wait to August to sign \n\nAlso possibly going crash at a friends place with but I\u2019m limited and looking on the Facebook page of FGCU roommates",

I sincerely hope that it doesn't happen, but I have a sneaking suspicion that by the middle of the semester we'll be fully online again...\n\nThen of course, there's the whole email about us not even knowing which of our classes are actually in person or not. I live down here, so it's not that big of a deal, but with as many people who live in apartments or dorms, it sucks. I mean, there's a real possibility that someone might have fully online classes, and they're stuck in their dorm or apartment contract.",

I already signed. I feel like we\u2019re all in the same boat but I can imagine that all the kids from FL schools are dealing with the same thing.",

If there is a class you need or desperately want that is not currently online, contact the instructor.  They may be able to let you know whether they are intending for the class to be moved online.",

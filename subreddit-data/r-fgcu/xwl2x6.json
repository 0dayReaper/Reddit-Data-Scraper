If you want to keep up with math, I recommend either doing a math major or software engineering with a math minor. Your algebra/calc classes will go from 60-90 people, but more upper-level classes will be less than 30. As for career outcomes, you could go into finance, data science, software engineering, math research, economics, and actuarial science and more. You have a lot of options for a math degree, but you will have to build some skills outside of school for a lot of careers.",

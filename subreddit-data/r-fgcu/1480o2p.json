            "comment": "Honestly, you should look into other options. Most people end up staying on the waitlist for a long time. As far as off-campus housing goes, the popular choices are The Reef, Coastal, and University Village. Most of those already have all units completely filled, but it\u2019s still possible that you can find something. There is a Facebook page for FGCU students looking for housing, as well as Snapchat stories for each class that students often advertise open rooms/sublets to. Good luck!",

The other two commenters have already mentioned solid places to search for off campus housing, and those options are fairly common.",

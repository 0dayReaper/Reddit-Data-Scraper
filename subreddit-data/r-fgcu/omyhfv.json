The heaviest dumbbells are 100 I believe. The gym is pretty nice sized. Theres pretty much every machine you can imagine and a full basketball and volleyball court also",

The shuttles run every 5-10 minutes and there's an app to track it. You can also walk, skateboard, bike, rollerblade, etc. The reasoning for this is because there is limited parking on campus and we need room for all the visitors, professors, and commuter students",

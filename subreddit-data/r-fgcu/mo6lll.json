            "comment": "My experience is likely different from most students. I came back into college after a long break and my math/physics knowledge base was rusty. I scrapped my way through PreCalc over the summer. Intro to CS and Calc I during the Fall. It was a lot of busy work but overall not bad. Frustrating a lot of times, but I had so much time to dedicate to Calc I that it was manageable.\n\nHowever, this semester, I'm taking Calc II, Physics 2048 with Lab, Intro to Programming (Java), and Statistics with Calculus. All online. It has been a pure distilled nightmare, so far.\n\n\\-If you don't already have the webcamera and presence of mind to be video taped during every exam/quiz, I would suggest you start getting used to it now. If you go the online route, which not every class is offered online, Respondus browser lock is pretty common. That being said, the browserlock isn't a massive deal; it's the random quirks that every Florida professor seems to have. No formula sheets, or if they allow formula sheets, they have to be hand written. One professor wants us to have our face and hands visible to the camera at all times. So with my current configuration at my desk, I'm basically halfway standing/balled up in front of my camera to make this happen. Upload your work within 10 minutes of an exam or you basically can be given a zero. I uploaded mine within 20 minutes (because life stuff happens) and got 10 points off my exam grade. Not the end of the world but it grinds on you.   \n\n\n\\-I feel like FGCU is a little stingy with transfer credits. I'm retaking Statistics because it wasn't 'Statistics with Calculus'. And I'm literally doing the exact same stuff from before. z &amp; t tests, population proportion tests, linear regression. Etc. They missed my science with lab credit until I emailed a syllabus and table of contents for the textbook. Not the biggest deal but again...it grinds on you.\n\n\\-My Java and Statistics professor are solid. Pay attention to the 'Rate My Professor' reviews. You can definitely see where some of the reviews are from clearly overly entitled students. But I can definitely see where people have their gripes with the staff. A lot of emphasis on self reading and looking through a massive amount of hyperlinks. You can definitely tell which professors have learnt that sometimes less material is actually 'more' . Especially in an online format. I've noticed a lot of professors give a lot of reading with additional resources (i.e. hyperlinks to various websites) and it honestly becomes overkill. Especially in the Software Engineering department. I prefer to learn from interaction/lecture. If not, why else would I be taking a class and not just going through some free programming tutorial available online?\n\n\\-Next, and admittedly in FGCU's defense, I'm not taking my Physics 1 class there. I took it at another college based on the recommendations of a few juniors. I took it as a transient student at Santa Fe college, where the physics and lab are purely online. I thought I'd be able to handle it. It has been, without question, one of the worst experiences I've had in college. The professor is almost checked out at this point, has stopped posting lecture videos, and just posts quick examples from Khan academy. Nearly all of our labs are still ungraded. I originally went outside of FGCU for the physics requirements because I heard FGCU's physics professors were pretty rough. Turns out, Santa Fe isn't much better. We started with 50 students and we're down to 19 but from what I understand, that's pretty typical of Physics. If it wasn't for tutors and paid help, I have zero idea how he expects us to complete our homework assignemnts. The class wasn't finishing their homework assignments early enough, so instead of reducing the workload, he up'd the homework assignments to two per work. So we went from 20 very difficult problems which he never demonstrated. To usually now 38-40 questions. The only reason I'm not failing (at least, not the extent that I should be) is because I've looked up PHY 2048 lectures from other Florida professors. And those at least have demonstrations of the typical problems you'll see in the homework.\n\n\\-The time I've invested into Physics has basically screwed over my Calc II class. Again, I'm only passing because of paid tutors. The professor posts tiny lectures, honestly Professor Leonard has taught me more about Calc II than FGCU. Overall, unless you are very grounded in your math/science fundamentals, avoid a lot of the online classes. The younger folk, provided they stay focused, seem to do much much better than me. So keep my old dumb state of mind relative to your situation.\n\n\\-Another really minor gripe but it's definitely becoming more apparent now. Is we're a week from finals. And I still have lessons and homework due this week. Every other university I've attended dedicates this week as a 'Study Week'. Instead, I have two quizzes, and a test this week. And these don't include the final exams I have next week. I don't get it, seriously. Just wrap things up.\n\nOverall, that's my way overloaded assessment of the SE program so far. The Software Engineering components have been good. A little hectic sometimes, but good. But these latest science/math classes are a giant nightmare. Probably going to check out UF's online Computer Science program next semester, because the next couple of classes I need are only offered on FGCU campus. And I'm not looking forward to making a 40 minute drive 5 days a week just so I can listen to what appears to be an almost universally disliked physics department.",

The schedule is incredibly strict because many key classes are only offered in the fall, so expect that if you fail one or are unable to complete it, you will be there for another year. \n\nThat being said, the school is restructuring its language focus from Java to C++, so things will be different in that capacity. However, as of now, it feels pretty antiquated learning this much Java and very little of other languages. \n\nAlso online learning with this major makes me want to head butt a circular saw",

Better scholarships, better academics, better fits for you - there are many aspects to consider. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a competitive school that pushes the boundaries on what\u2019s new in tech, FGCU is not that. It\u2019s a biology focused school that cares more about Florida\u2019s ecosystem and the different sciences behind it (bio, marine bio, medical, our new water school being built right now). We begrudgingly have a software engineering major, and is rather underfunded and could use another professor or two. But, despite all that, it was the best choice for me financially and location-wise.",

    "postText": "I am currently on the waitlist for the dorms. I live an hour away, but will probably have early classes. I would like to know if there is any location where I can sleep in my car (night before exams/early classes) 2-3 nights a week. I am most concerned with getting harassed by police than anything else and plan to keep my setup minimal and non-intrusive in a nicer car. So, any advice?",

Other than that OP, Walmart on 41/Estero is a good bet for overnight parking. Avoid town center though, mall security is strict about that type of stuff.",

I've seen a few people sleep there, it's down to the store manager as to whether or not they do anything about it. Basically just keep it low profile and leave early in the morning and you'll be good.",

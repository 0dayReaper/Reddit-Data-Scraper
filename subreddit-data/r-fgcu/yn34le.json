    "postText": "I have my AA and am transferring to FGCU this spring. I\u2019m currently set as a psychology major since it\u2019s a common major for people who are going into physical therapy and I felt that it was a good foundation for a job that involves injured people but after looking at degree works I don\u2019t think I will be able to take all of the required courses needed to get into a doctoral program with this major. For context, I was originally planning to be a comp sci major but after taking a few classes I decided that it wasn\u2019t for me but that means I don\u2019t have any science courses done apart from A&amp;P I and Psych 2012. What major would you recommend? Also, how do I go about switching majors? Which advisor do I make an appointment with? Are there any advisors that can help me with this specifically?",

            "comment": "If you are planning on going into a specific college then speak to the advisors within that college. For example, if you wanted to switch to an engineering major talk to the engineering advisors, I'm like 80% sure on that. \n\nThere is also exploratory advising, which is usually for people who haven't really gone into a major yet, so they might be of help to you as they typically work with freshmen and sophomores who are prone to switching their majors.  Exploratory has general knowledge about all the majors if you truly have no idea, so id recommend going to them. From there if you want more specific info about a major visit the college itself (engineering, health, etc). [https://www.fgcu.edu/academics/advising/explore/](https://www.fgcu.edu/academics/advising/explore/) \n\nWhat you could also do is in degree works you can click the what if at the side and pick different majors and that will generate a degree works page of all the classes you'd need if you'd switch to that major.",

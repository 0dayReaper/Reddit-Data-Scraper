    "postText": "I know that someone else asked you guys some questions literally less than a week ago. But I have a few questions of my own. Sorry in advance if some of them seem repetitive.\n\nAnyways, I'm a sophomore in high school, but I am trying to work towards graduating in my junior year. I am also a DE student and should be done with my AA degree next year (so I technically won't be starting university as a freshie). My dad always wanted me to go to one of the more popular schools like UF, FSU, FIT, UCF or maybe even some Ivy League schools. I don't want to go to them, though, because I feel like their learning environment would hinder my academic abilities instead of help them.  \n\nThat being said, those schools are \"top-tier\" schools so it would make sense to go to them. Plus some people were telling me to reconsider my choice of FGCU since it had a 49% graduation rate. Still, I really feel like FGCU is the best university for me personally. To help me cement this choice, though, I was wondering if you guys could answer some questions for me:\n\n1. I'm planning on going for a B.S. in Biotechnology. For those of you formerly or currently in that program, do you think it has/is properly preparing you for the type of work you guys want to pursue post-graduation?\n2. How good are my chances of being able to go through my undergrad years without having to pay a cent out-of-pocket or taking out a loan?\n3. How are the extra-curriculars? Do you guys have a fraternity and, if so, how beneficial would it be to join it?\n4. Would you guys argue that your learning experience has improved since coming to FGCU?\n5. What are the insurance policies like at the school? I haven't had health insurance since elementary school so this is something that I've begun taking into consideration when it comes to colleges.\n6. What resources does the school have to help students who are struggling with a specific subject or class?\n7. How are the religious organizations like over there? I'm a Seventh-Day Adventist and want to grow in my religion along with my academics while I'm in college.\n8. How would you rate the stress levels at the college (especially around midterm and finals season)?\n\nSorry that this post turned out to be pretty long. I appreciate everybody who took time out of their day to read it all. Also, I know that some of these questions may seem frivolous, nit-picky, and/or unimportant, but I put them in because I wanted a more complete view of what this school is like. Anyways, I'm grateful to anyone who decides to answer.",

By the information you have given about your work ethic and current graduation course I will assume you are a very bright individual and will have no problem attending this university with no out of pocket expense especially if you apply for any scholarships.\n\n3. We do have fraternities on campus but I cannot attest to their usefulness. But my outside view of them is if you are trying to make friends it is a good way. If you are looking to party they are for you. Besides that I would avoid them in my personal opinion.\n\n4. We have great teachers here and I do believe the small class sizes help ones ability to learn the material better.\n\n6. We have many resources for student who need help with any subject, writing center, center for academic achievement that can\u2019t help with any class. Many classes have TA\u2019s that will hold SI sessions for student to recover the material to clarify any questions in an even smaller and personal environment.\n\n8. My stress level is honestly a 4, I do well enough that no matter what I get on my finals I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nIn my opinion you sound like a bright kid and I\u2019m not saying your talent will be wasted here but if you are looking for a graduate program you might want to consider a higher \u201ctier\u201d school. I would apply to the colleges you mentioned and see what they are willing to offer you in terms of financial aid. You would be surprised. This is a great school and we are growing and becoming better every year. If small classes is what let\u2019s you learn best then this is a great place for you. Good Luck",

            "comment": "The other comments including the suggestion to contact the specific professor are great, that is something that should definitely help you out. I wanted to add a couple of things on a tangent to what you asked. \n\nFGCU's graduation rate of 49% in 2016-2017 is essentially measured to the class that started 6 years prior to that. So you should consider that was nearly 10 years ago that those students started.  Now, if you are graduating from high school early and with an AA then it's likely that you are an outstanding student. So don't stress so much on the school's average statistics when you're well above average. I was mainly the top student in my classes and didn't let the statistics of the school as a whole bother me. I've also seen a lot of dedication on the part of the faculty in my major to helping students pass the curriculum. I've been told other schools have a lot more graduate students teaching classes than phd professors and I appreciate that at FGCU I've only had two non-phd professors. They were part-time professors and full time working professionals so that was completely ok. \n\nBiotechnology seems like a degree that begs for post-grad, so it's going to be extra important for you to know what you're going to do after graduating with your B.S. degree. I'm sure that's something that more online research and speaking to professors can help you with. Living the life of a masters/phd student is not for everyone and I think you'll want to understand what that is well before you commit to a decision. There is also a very active biomedical engineering program that has similar aspects but is fairly well rounded, obviously building you towards being a working professional with the B.S.\n\nAll that being said, college is a big change from high school and going into it extra young may make things tougher for you. You'll have to work harder in school but also not as hard to have a good balance in your life and not let school overcome you. I know it sounds a little contradictory but it's something you'll have to figure out. Hopefully you will have good family support no matter which school you go to. If the support could be better elsewhere than FGCU then you'll have to weigh that carefully with your perceived advantage of FGCU.",

            "comment": "Hello! I'm a Psych and Criminal Justice major so I don't know how the biotechnology program is. Though from what I have heard it is a great program.\n\n2. I'm not sure. There are a lot of scholarships at FGCU that you can apply for. \n\n3. There are a lot of extracurriculars from FGCU Naturalists, Political clubs, clubs for charities and more. I'm an officer for Improv Club and a criminal justice fraternity on campus. They have a lot to offer and you can make a lot of friends through them. There is Greek life but FGCU unlike many schools do not have Greek houses. I'm not in a sorority but I have heard very mixed things from my friends. \n\n4. I do think my learning experience has improved. FGCU has smaller class sizes than most of the universities I looked into. Having the smaller class sizes has been a big help and I love it.\n\n5. I'm not sure what you been by the insurance policies at the school. Though the on campus wellness center/doctor's office is very inexpensive. There is also CAPS which provides free therapy and meetings with a psychiatric if you want. \n\n6. There are a lot of resources at the school if you are struggling. The Center for Academic Achievement has tutoring and SI's for classes which are mostly STEM. If you have a disability or learning disability Adaptive Services will help you get tutoring for classes. I have gotten tutoring for two separate classes through AS. Most professors are very willing to meet with you outside of class if you are struggling with anything. \n\n7. I'm personally not religious but I do know there are a few christian/Catholic organizations on campus that holds mass. I do know there is a Seventh Day Adventist Church near by. \n\n8. Stress levels depend on the class and how many assignments. For me if the only things that are graded are the midterm and final I find it more stressful than those that have a quiz every week. Stress is a personal thing. \n\nI hope this helps! I always thought FGCU was the school for me and I love it here! Good luck!",

            "comment": "Hi, I recently graduated from FGCU as a Biology major and my boyfriend also did as well as a Biotechnology major. The majors are quite similar except for only a couple extra courses catered to just biotech. To answer your 1st question, I would say it depends on what you want to do after you graduate. If you want to work in a lab as a research tech, this can definitely prepare you to do that. It is also a good start for even higher education if you want to pursue a PhD. \n\nI also want to mention some stuff about the program because even though I was a Biology major, I did work closely with some of the students and frequently talked to the program director, Dr. Takashi Ueda. He is an amazing professor and director. If you really plan on majoring in biotech, you should really get in contact with him, he keeps tabs on all of his students in the program since it\u2019s so small. He literally has an excel file of all of his students.His wife Dr. Cruz Alvarez also works closely with the students in the program and their lab is a great one to join. The lab experiences they provide has really made a lot of his students very successful after graduation. In FGCU\u2019s Biotechnology program history there hasn\u2019t been a lot of graduates, I\u2019ve heard only about 60 have graduated with biotech degrees since FGCU has been around. Also, the last I heard, they are debating on keeping the program since so little people major in it (this may just be a rumor, if he does decide to leave any time soon I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be for another give or take 5 ish years) since that is the case if you are really considering biotech at FGCU, please try and get in contact with him. \n\nI hope this helps!",

            "comment": "Formerly a a Biology major(Now environmental studies) and can say that the best part about the studying here at FGCU is the class sizes being smaller than normal which helps a ton in creating deeper relationships with peers and even your professors. The worst class to me was BIO2 being a 150 student lecture hall class (not hard really) just hated being stuck not being able to apply any practice problems or collab with peers on practicing concepts. Just shut up and listen, and memorize. Much like a math class which I disdain, but the pretty major specific courses get significantly smaller in class size and thus problems solved. Also a buddy of mine at the gym is an fgcu alumni who works for a prosthetic company with his degree in Biotechnology (or maybe Bioengineering, still very similar). \n\nTHIS IS NOT A PARTY SCHOOL!!!!! Good luck if thats what ur into, Your best bet is to join the frats like Kappa Sigma. There really is no party scene, although most of my friends were from chemistry (who held parties in their dorms)and meeting a few guys doing flatground skateboarding in the great lawn (lots of events happen here throughout the day, right in front of the library). If your involved you\u2019ll find the parties. If you live on campus you will for sure get a better experience in this respect.\n\nSchools pretty nice and was my safety school, as I live in the area and it was always seen as a safe university that anyone could make it in. In retrospect me and alot of peers in highschool never thought very highly of the school and set our sights for UF, FSU, USF, etc. Honestly I was wrong to have such an elitist attitude just because the school was small and so easy to get into, the school is great and the vibe is extremely lax/carefreeif that makes sense(perhaps chill is the better word). Also have to mention the weather cant be beat (as I type this the high is 82 degrees for tomorrow, more global warming if anything). \n\nHonestly don\u2019t let the size or others opinions be the deciding factor, you sound very gifted and any school will let you in (tests scores permitting of course). You\u2019ll make it into this school (pretty much a shoe in if you stay on track) so now think on what is best for YOU, not what will make your parents most proud, not what will impress people the most, or what will make you the most money after undergrad. The degree, and your college experience, is yours to choose for you.",

My concentration is in water resource science and management (the other two are ecology and teaching environmental science/ecology. I will probably switch into the last one due to my career but I REALLY like my current concentration.) My favorite professor ever was in my first concentration specific course this semester and his class is so intriguing, but many respected professors at this school are from stem courses. Because there\u2019s so many common prereqs with the life science majors you can easily minor in the other majors.\n\nProgram is great because of FGCU\u2019s location and impact on the SWFL region. Fgcu is dedicated to fixing the environmental issues of SWFL, stemming from Lake Okeechobee and the impacts on tourism from algae blooms reaching our beaches. Our small school is one of the leaders addressing environmental issues in Florida. In fact FGCU is opening a Water School building for majors to focus on water management issues of SWFL. Construction started in November.\n\nTons of Ecology research opportunities at FGCU\u2019s vesper bay research facility (I have a grad student friend who I skate with that works their while pursuing his masters). But if working as an environmental scientist or lab tech is your desired career, Environmental Science majors will probably have a leg up on you if your resume isn\u2019t up to snuff (their major is a B.S not a B.A like mine their major is a tad more rigorous chem wise). Many become ecologists, teachers, lab techs, water resource engineers, marine scientists (ironically even though there\u2019s a marine science major) etc...\n\nBut the environmental studies major emphasizes just as much on environmental policy(no change can be done if we cant get politicians to make legal changes), so you can use the major or dual major in conjunction with political science to become a lobbyist for environmental groups and agencies to push legislation. Thats kinda what sets it apart from Environmental Science IMO and is a very good alternative path to go with this major.\n\nPersonally I have a minor in Education so im gonna teach highschool science with my major. If you stay in the area after you graduate you will be pretty in demand, Our state\u2019s economy is UBER dependent on the environment (cause tourism) and construction.\n\nOh and lastly, the major is honestly a cake walk compared to BIO.",

There\u2019s an in school beach, brand new gym and lots of events happening daily on campus so you have to be sociable and involved to not get bored.\n\nLots of shopping centers  nearby so LOTS of part time job opportunities, but if you cant drive out to nearby cities (like the rest of Fort Myers, or Naples) it can get old pretty fast. Naples FL is extremely nice and wealthy, perfect beaches, and has lots of stuff to do(I go to a clay studio in naples occasionally and make glazed bowls for Naples Empty Bowls charity.) Only 15 minutes away driving.\n\nIf you have a car it\u2019ll be fine. But if I was dorming without a car I would prefer USF or UCF, especially USF. Also remember Orlando can be pretty sketchy crime wise. Here at fgcu, Ive left my windows down in the parking garages here, lost my wallet multiple times, even lost my skateboard like 3 times, but EVERYTIME would get it back. Never robbed, and students would literally reach out on canvas and send me their address saying found ur wallet hmu. The sense of community is astonishing.",

I applied to FSU and FGCU (I live in Ft myers so I knew it was gonna be the cheapest option anyway) FSU accepted me but offered no day 1 scholarship, FGCU offered me their highest tier scholarship and put me automatically into the Honors program (which is awesome because you get priority registration and don't have to fight to be certain classes as a freshman).  SO basically I paid $0 for all my classes and actually got money BACK from the school. If you're super ahead like you say you are you're probably a shoe in for this kind of situation, since FGCU is smaller they really try to get the bright students to stay.\n\nExtra: I'm an art major, but I think this applies to everywhere at fgcu -- Smaller class size and way more dedicated professors means you will find yourself getting a lot more opportunities than you would at a large school. Although my art program is small, my professors know me by name and when a cool thing comes around they come right to me. If I was at a bigger school maybe I would've had a more traditional education but I wouldn't have half of my resume.",

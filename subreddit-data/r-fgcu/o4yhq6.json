It\u2019s almost all sophomores and juniors while most seniors go off campus or westlake. However, majority of northlake is 4 person so I mean if you know nobody it\u2019s a gamble the right people make the experience worth it. Oh and if you live on campus you can\u2019t park on campus its the only terrible thing imo.\n\nThat being said I left northlake for coastal this fall semester, slightly cheaper and you can park as a commuter to fgcu which was what ultimately swayed me. Coastal and the reef are the only off campus thats worth it.",

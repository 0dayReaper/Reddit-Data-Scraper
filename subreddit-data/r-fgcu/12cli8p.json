From my perspective, for the opportunities and most value per dollar, I do feel that FGCU's MBA program grants the best of both worlds. Either way it is your choice, they are both great options.",

            "comment": "I am about halfway through the MBA accelerate program right now. Are you doing it online?\n\nFGCU's cost can't be beaten. My work reimburses me up to $5,250 per year so I think out of pocket I will only be paying $1,000 - $2,000 for the entire degree. Ultimately this is why I went with FGCU. I don't feel like I am learning anything valuable though. The professors are laughable and most don't care about any questions/concerns you have. Grading is not fair or equal across all students. It depends on a number of things: Who is your TA? Some TA's grade easier than others. Did your lockdown browser for exams fail? In one class half of the class's lockdown didn't work so they all scored very high because they were able to get the answers off Chegg while the other half had to actually do the exam. Nothing was done to correct this or make it fair. \n\nIf you are looking to gain actual knowledge I'd look elsewhere. But if you are looking to check a box and add MBA at the end of your email signature, go for it.",

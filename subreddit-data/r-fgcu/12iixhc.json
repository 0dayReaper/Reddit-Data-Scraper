It says it only has one outlet and to look into a combination fridge and microwave. does that mean there\u2019s only one plug? or is it one outlet with two plugs. stupid question maybe!",

That being said i had my own fridge and microwave inside my room, did not use the common space because it\u2019s so small and i didn\u2019t know my roommate",

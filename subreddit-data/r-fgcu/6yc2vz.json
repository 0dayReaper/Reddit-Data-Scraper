    "postText": "##**9/6/2017 As of ~~11AM, no official word has been released from FGCU. Many people are pissed~~.** \n\n# As of 12:06PM, a notice has been sent out that campus is closed on Thursday and Friday. Word will come down on Sunday for the status of the following week. I have pasted the official email below. \n\n---\n\n---\nAs of this post, FGCU is still scheduled to be \"open\" during Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of this week due to uncertainty surrounding Irma's path. Chief Moore has stated in an email to the student body that they are holding a meeting tomorrow (Wednesday) morning to determine how to operate the campus and its shelters in the event of landfall. The general consensus is that FGCU will be closed Thursday and Friday, and likely part of the following week depending on damages. It is highly recommended that you err on the side of caution and operate as if you 100% expect a vicious storm to make landfall this week.  \n\n## **If you live in FGCU Campus Housing**\n\nIn the event of a hurricane, you will be required to leave campus for safer territory or you will be required to go to a shelter they will set up, likely in Alico Arena. Get your bags and toiletries ready far ahead of time, because you *will* think of things that you need and should have gotten if you do it too quickly. I recommend a surge protector and some non-electronic games as well. It's a good time to make friends with people whose parents live too far away to board up or who don't have friends with stable houses. Alternatively, bring homework or books. \n\n##**If you live off-campus** \n\nIf you've lived in your house through a hurricane before (it's been a decade since this last happened, so if that applies you likely live with your parents or relatives,) be sure that you know it held up back then, and then be less sure because it's still potentially a **Category Fuck Your Entire Life Up 5.** Many houses in San Carlos are stilted. Many are cheap and shabby. *Don't risk it. Get out of dodge or find a shelter.*\n\n---\n\nIf you think it will take you a while to prepare and leave, I don't recommend going to any classes they hold on Wednesday. Take the time to get done what you need to get done. Your professors probably want to prepare as well. Some may even cancel classes. Your time is more valuable than run of the mill daily duties when disasters of this magnitude are involved. \n\n##**Prepwork**\n\n[LINK TO THE LEE COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT \"All Hazards\" GUIDE.](http://www.leegov.com/publicsafety/Documents/Emergency%20Management/Media%20Resources%20-%20All%20Hazards%20Guide/AHG2017-English-all.pdf) \n\nThe above guide is a phenomenal resource. Its development was overseen by FGCU's own Emergency Manager Gerald Campbell for what I assume was his 12 year tenure before he came to the University. \n\nUnfortunately if you've waited this long, many of the supplies including gas, water, core foodstuffs and such are in short supply, but do what you can. Most of Southwest Florida is in a state of emergency following these hurricane projections. Don't fuck around and consider this a spectacle or \"Cool Florida Shit\" to watch. This storm is dangerous. \n\n",

We have just concluded an FGCU Emergency Advisory Council meeting called by President Mike Martin and UPD Chief Steven Moore to discuss Hurricane Irma and its implications for the University.  Because of the approaching storm and the myriad of unknowns with regard to its landfall, all FGCU classes, operations and events are canceled for Thursday, September 7 and Friday, September 8, and continuing through the weekend. \n\n&gt;**We will make a decision at 1 p.m. on Sunday, September 10 regarding whether the University will reopen on Monday, September 11, and an announcement will be made then.**  \n\nWe recognize that some students, faculty and staff who evacuated will be in other parts of the state and country, and as always encourage you to make decisions based on personal safety that are in your and your family\u2019s best interests.  As with all such impending serious weather events, a number of factors are considered when making the decision on whether to close the University, and when to reopen it.  This includes important preparation time for students, faculty and staff, as well as potentially unsafe driving conditions to and from the campus. \n\n&gt;**Some important notes:**\n\n\u2022\tToday (Wednesday, September 6) is a regular workday for FGCU employees.  Also, all FGCU classes at all locations will meet as regularly scheduled today and tonight (Wednesday).\n\n\u2022\tStudents living in FGCU housing will receive specific updates from FGCU Student Housing staff.  \n\n\u2022\tAt this time, Lee County has not announced shelter arrangements for citizens affected by the storm.  As you know, FGCU has the option if needed of opening Alico Arena as a shelter for our residential students who chose to remain in student housing\u2014IF conditions warrant and it is safe to do so. \n\n\u2022\tAs of 8 p.m. Friday night, the campus will be closed for everyone except FGCU-designated essential personnel.  This means that employees are NOT to come to the campus unless your supervisor has designated you as \u201cEssential Personnel.\u201d  When you leave campus at the end of business today, you should take with you any work materials or personal items you think you might need at home while the University is closed.\n\n\u2022\tALL FGCU programs, classes, and events are canceled for Thursday, Friday and the weekend at all locations, including off-site such as the Herald Court Charlotte Center, Naples Center, etc.\n\n\u2022\tPlease do NOT cancel an FGCU event or activity scheduled for next week without advance approval from your unit\u2019s respective vice president.\n\n\u2022\tFGCU employees will be on paid administrative leave on Thursday and Friday.  Supervisors of FGCU-designated essential personnel can work directly with the Office of Human Resources on matters involving additional hours worked.\n\n\u2022\tFGCU Police &amp; Public Safety will maintain campus security during the campus closing.\n\n\u2022\tBusiness Technology Services suggests you may wish to back up your computer drive if you have not done so recently, including to One Drive for important documents, but asks that you NOT move office computers.  \n\n\u2022\tStarting tonight, FGCU\u2019s main telephone number (239-590-1000) will have a recorded message stating the University is closed for Thursday, Friday and the weekend.  In addition, you are asked to record a similar message on your department\u2019s/office\u2019s main number at the end of business today, as well as activate your email out-of-office feature.  A suggested message is as follows:  \u201cDue to Hurricane Irma, Florida Gulf Coast University will be closed on Thursday, September 7 and Friday, September 8.  All classes, business operations, and activities are canceled.  We will make a decision on Sunday afternoon as to when the University will reopen, based on weather conditions.  Thank you.\u201d  (NOTE: Please remember to remove this taped message when you return to your office in order to avoid confusion.)\n\n\u2022\tFGCU Police Chief Steven Moore will continue to update the campus on the latest weather advisories as they are issued by the National Hurricane Center and other agencies.\n  \n&gt;I will provide updates as they become available via email, and these updates also will be posted to the FGCU emergency management webpage at: https://www2.fgcu.edu/em/, and announced through FGCU Alerts.  (I'll consecutively number storm emails in the subject line, as indicated above.)  As with all such weather situations, in the unlikely event you are unable to access emails or the FGCU website, please tune in to local television and radio stations for FGCU announcements.  \n\nThanks, and be safe \u2013\n\nSusan\n",

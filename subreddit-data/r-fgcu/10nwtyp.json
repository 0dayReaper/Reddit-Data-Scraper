    "postText": "I\u2019m from mass and I\u2019m applying as a transfer student for the fall semester as a junior. I\u2019m curious what my relative odds odds acceptance are. I currently have a 3.1 gpa (not too proud of that as last semester brought down my gpa) and I got a 1060 on my sat (I was not a good high school student). I do however have 3 very good letters of recommendation 2 from and internship and 1 from a professor. I\u2019m almost worried a little that I may have to restructure my schools that I\u2019m applying to as fgcu is a safety school. The part that makes me nervous is that online it says the transfer acceptance rate is 68% which is a little bit lower than I\u2019d like for a safety school to have especially when I have a 3.1 gpa. I\u2019m just curious as to what your thoughts are I know it\u2019s hard to say but I\u2019m just curious as to what you guys were accepted with even if you aren\u2019t a transfer student. I\u2019m also aware gpa isn\u2019t the main deciding factor in admissions but it is the most common.",

Sovi dining is what you probably expect from a freshman hall dining hall, the food is not the best however, if you\u2019re like me and just need some feed, it\u2019s good for that\n\nAlso,FGCU is a *good* university but not a *great* university. There\u2019s many things I would change, including having no college football team, some professors have a lack of empathy for students who are going through difficulties in life, I\u2019m serious about looking at Rate My Professor. \n\nThat being said, if you\u2019re facing difficulties in life, or even if you aren\u2019t and you\u2019re like me and like to have someone in your corner supporting you, I highly highly recommend you speak to Student Care Services in Cohen center \n\n\nMany professors in the science, business, and hospitality classes are more difficult than they need to be and are hard asses. A degree in Entrepreneurship like I\u2019m doing I recommend, professors are relatively nice and get your degree and something meaningful (unlike the major integrated studies) \n\nJoin lots of clubs at FGCU I recommend that. Try to get involved as much as you can.\n\nIn summary, FGCU is what you make of it. Try to make lots of new friends and talk to this many people as possible. So many people are in here exact same shoes where you don\u2019t know anyone and everyone just trying to make friend. The best way to make a friend is to be a friend. The excellent to each other and supportive and use Quizlet.",

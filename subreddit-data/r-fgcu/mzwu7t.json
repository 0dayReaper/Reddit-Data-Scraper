    "postText": "Asking because it seems every year there's one or two people from my relatively small northern suburb coming here. It just seemed like a kind of random place to be getting that much interest from people in Boston. Is there a good party scene? Super close beach access? Big out of state scholarships? Top ranking in a popular subfield like marine biology?",

            "comment": "Well as someone who graduated (too many moons ago) and now lives in Boston a few things stand out:\n1) The price of tuition in mass is absolutely insane, there is a reason why UMass professors are always the top 10 paid state employees, and professors at fgcu will straight up tell you they\u2019re not paid enough and you need to buy their textbook to take the class. \n2) the dorms are luxury compared to traditional college dorms and again, if I don\u2019t need to share a public bathroom AND only pay $3k for 5months, I\u2019m already there. \n3) \u201cescaping\u201d down to Florida is just a New England/ North East thing to do. And I say this as someone who was born and raised in CNY. Florida just has this vibe of a different lifestyle and tbh, explore that while you\u2019re so young! Also being able to walk to your car in December and immediately driving away is such a luxury compared to tiptoeing on ice, shoveling your car, de-icing your car, and warming it up. Also the beach helps!",

I had been to most of the major colleges in the state and I found FGCU very attractive.  As for others, there was a lot of out of state and out of country students.  One of my roommates was Canadian.  His family has a vacation home down in Naples.  A friend I met was from Missouri.  Same deal, family had a summer home, though I think it was in Bonita Springs.  Had a neighbor from outside of Chicago.  Her family vacationed on Sanibel.  I think a lot of people come to the area to vacation and when the kid gets older, they think about going their for an extended vacation... oh and get a college education in the process.",

But I'm from Boston, went to UCF, military, BHCC, now UNM. \n\nWife's sis went to FGCU after a year at New College in Sarasota, we helped her move into the dorms in 2019. From my two days there plus her recent feedback I'll relay: it's a retail away-college experience similar to UCF, but not much to do in town &amp; you'll likely need a car/taxi to do it (e.g. Eden, A Show Bar)\n\nI was impressed by their permaculture park, so if that overlaps your major I think you'll dig it.",

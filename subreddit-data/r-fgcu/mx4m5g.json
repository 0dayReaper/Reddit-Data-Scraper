I got an email about room selection, and it says you get to select your exact room, but how does that work exactly?? Do you see an image of the floorplan and choose from that, or do you just pick a room number from a list? Sorry if this is a dumb question, I'm just a little confused on how it works.",

            "comment": "Not a dumb question! So the FGCU website should have the floor plans that Sovi offers. If not, just Google \u201cFGCU Sovi floor plans.\u201d From what I remember, there are two floor plans \n\nBiscayne (the one I lived in), Everglades, and Palmetto have two separate bedrooms and a shared bathroom.\n\nEagle and Osprey (the newest) have three separate bedrooms and a small kitchen area with a fridge and stove. Pretty sure there\u2019s two bathrooms with that one? \n\nI didn\u2019t get to choose my exact room number. You just choose the floor plan you want. On the room selection there should be like a drop down list or an option to bubble in which one you want. \n\nMy advice: If you\u2019re gonna do any amount of cooking, let\u2019s say 3+ times a week, go for Eagle or Osprey. The other buildings have one kitchen on one floor, but that\u2019s for the entire building. It wasn\u2019t that big of a deal for me cause I just went to Sovi, but it\u2019s something to consider",

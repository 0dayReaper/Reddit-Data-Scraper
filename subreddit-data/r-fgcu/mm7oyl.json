Shits lit even on a fucking monday. \n\nAnd no, nowhere in the US is letting you drink at 18, so just get older friends buy it for you or make older friends and go to there house-parties at northlake or off campus. Wrong school for partying but you\u2019ll make it bud (senior btw)\n\n[Barstool at the Keys](https://youtu.be/VulX0pE0vac)",

The campus will be closed until the 10th of October due to the hurricane so if you have any other questions by the 10th (next Monday) here is the number that should connect you to the scholarship office: (239) 590-7920\n\nThat's about all I can do to get you started, unless you can be more specific about which scholarships you want to apply for. Hope it helps.",

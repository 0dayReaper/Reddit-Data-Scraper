FGCU in my experience is a very laid back campus and student body. there are parties and places to party at but not anywhere near the level of UCF. if you haven\u2019t i HIGHLY recommend taking a tour and spending a day on both campuses (they are open to the public) to get the overall vibe of the area. i can\u2019t totally speak for UCF but FGCU is actually more in a suburb area called estero and the university is literally surrounded by a community called \u201cmiromar lakes\u201d which is basically just a small snowbird and university donor golf haven where billionaires build houses with 16 bedrooms and 16 bathrooms for the bell of it. (i\u2019m not kidding ive toured the community for class and they literally have a house there that big) not much open at night and not many food options other than chains near the campus. \n\nreally though, if you can swing it visit the campuses yourself bc no matter what anyone tells you online you\u2019re really only gonna know which ones for you by experiencing it yourself",

UCF is definitely going to be more of a party atmosphere because Orlando is a huge place. Some people don't want that and the social life around FGCU is enough. but UCF has theme parks, a huge downtown, a football team, 4x the people...",

Weather is the same in both (might get a little colder in the winter months up in central FL) but other than that same thing. Just hot for most of the time, rainy during the rainy season. And then it\u2019s cold for like a few weeks/months. \n\nSocial it all depends what you put into it. I honestly met much better people down here in the FM area compared to Orlando. It\u2019s easier to get into friend groups and go out/party when your class size is 30-50 compared to 100+.",

Its not quite the party school that UF &amp; UCF are but all im going to mention is how awesome the Mitch Buchanon parties were. Tuition is higher but depending on your major their are much smaller class sizes and more often than not, unlike the overcrowded state schools, help for your classwork is certainly available. Professors are more available, tutors are also another option and all in all its a more sociable campus. Mind you though this was pre COVID.\n\nWeather wise its just like any other part of Florida. Hope this helps.",

There is no in-between and expect rain at the most inconvenient times as well as it being for only like 15-20 minutes of it POURING then nothing. Also humidity sucks. I know it sounds like shit but it is (for the most part) worth it.",

    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m thinking about living on campus. I\u2019ve heard of both student housing. The problem is, I can\u2019t decide. I know at West Lake you can live year round. Is that the same for North Lake, or is it by semester? And if so, will I be able to live in the same apartment for the following semester?",

In west lake you all have your own room, bathroom and walk in closet. West lake is generally much harder to get into than north lake. You would be off campus and have to commute and park on campus. North lake is more convenient, west lake has nicer housing",

I\u2019m just curious because I saw that it\u2019s not an 11.5 month agreement like West Lake and I thought that you are moved to a different apartment next semester. For example: live in Falcon in Fall then get assigned to Egret in the Spring.",

You\u2019ll just have to reapply for housing if you want to stay for your senior year. You have the dorm if you want to squat and stay in the same dorm for the next year. You\u2019ll just have to move in again",

    "postText": "I\u2019m transferring to FGCU this semester but I have to wait until orientation (December 20th) to sign up for classes. I emailed the school about this to see if there was anyway to sign up sooner and they said no but that they add classes around this time for this type of situation. Is this true? I\u2019m a psych major so are there any professors should avoid? I\u2019m going to be taking two classes at a different school so I\u2019m trying to set myself for success.",

            "comment": "Yes. It is true that courses are added last minute if enough students need the credits from a specific course and they need another course section- you might not love the time slot. But they need to add course sections when there is available classroom, faculty and students to offer it.",

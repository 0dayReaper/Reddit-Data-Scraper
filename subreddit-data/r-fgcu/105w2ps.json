    "postText": "I just transferred to FGCU and had to sign up for classes through an advisor because of a prerequisite hold. I\u2019m an online student and we worked out to get me the only classes available. Looking at it today, it says those clases were cancelled and now I\u2019m enrolled in on campus classes, which I cannot make it to (I live on the other side of the state). Anyone else had this happen to them ?",

            "comment": "I would try to get in contact with an advisor ASAP. They will be the ones that will help you the most. Usually when a class gets canceled it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have anyone to teach it. Worst comes to worse, once the semester begins you could always email the professor you were assigned to and explain the situation to them and see if they can help you, but advising will be the ones to help you. They might stick you into another online option (if there is one) that is already full.",

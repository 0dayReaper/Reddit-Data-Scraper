    "postText": "I wanted to attend UCF so badly rather than going to FGCU but finances ate me in the ass. So what do I have to look forward too while attending this school because my friends complain about this school a lot. I hear more cons rather pros. But hey at the end of the day a degree is a degree no matter where ya get it from.\n\nCons I usually hear\n- No diversity \n- Area being lame/trash \n- Not really anything to do\n- The schooling system being weird ( like finances wise/ putting weird holds on people)\nAlso do not come for me \nThis is all hearsay\u2026\u2026\n\nEdit: lmaoo my one friend even said it\u2019s like going to a big giant HIghschool \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

You get out of it what you put in but it\u2019s definitely like a big high school that has fraternities and sororities and all that.",

            "comment": "Here\u2019s my POV on the cons you listed - \n\n- No diversity: This is half true, it depends where you look. My girlfriend, who is Asian was looking at sororities and probably 90% of the girls were blonde white girls with the exception of one low class sorority. With disregarding that exception, I\u2019m President of the Chess Club at FGCU and I\u2019d definitely say our club is very diverse as well as I\u2019ve seen from other clubs. But I think the frat and especially sorority life isn\u2019t very diverse at all.\n\n- Area being lame/trash: It really depends on what you find interesting to do. The night life is very bad but there\u2019s a bunch of other stuff you can do such as going to the beach/waterfront.\n\n- Not really anything to do: It all comes down to how you put yourself out there. If you actively put yourself into the mix of meeting new people and getting involved, you\u2019ll find yourself without time to do things.\n\n- Schooling system: This one I\u2019d have to agree is pretty annoying with advisors not really knowing the best about stuff and also have the covid paychecks where they pay thousands of dollars to literally anyone. They\u2019re also a little weird on their scholarship requirements.",

I don\u2019t enjoy going out to bars or dartys, I\u2019m not really a big fan of sports, and I don\u2019t give a shit about sororities/fraternities. \n\nYes, there is kinda a lack of racial diversity here. But there is plenty of intellectual, political, economic, religious and sexual diversity here as well. I have friends of different races, sexualities, and economic backgrounds. \n\nPersonally, FGCU had exactly what I was looking for: it places an emphasis on being eco friendly, it had my forensic studies major, it\u2019s close to beaches, small class sizes (I have social anxiety), it has shuttles that take you to class so you don\u2019t have to drive your own car, food on campus (Jamba Juice is definite must if you end up attended here). \n\nI made a couple of really good friends here at FGCU and so far I love it here. It can sometimes take some time to find the ride-or-die friends, but once you do you\u2019re set.",

It definitely definitely needs growth good teachers college football program and better housing\n\n\nThere\u2019s lots of diversity all over the campus \n\nThere are some pretty cool spots in the area bars and shops and beaches. Plus there\u2019s some pretty cool nap spots you can find in the library that give you that jolt of being alive when trying to rats your eyes and you spiral into a another dimension\n\nMost of the professors hear pretend there at a Big 10 school or ACC or SEC when in reality they\u2019re at a decently respectfully university has the opportunity to grow tenfold if they had a college football program\n\nUCF is a great school and you\u2019re right OP, however at UCF the acronym is you can\u2019t finish. It\u2019s over 60,000 students and each one of them is meaningless as the other. \n\nFGCU needs to have a college football team and play first at the small level. We don\u2019t need a fancy stadium with 10,000 seats. All we need is a field to field goal post and we can do that. There\u2019s room here at FGCU. \n\nWhen I drove by the campus today I saw the bulldozed at about 6 acres on the north west entrance of FGCU. I hope and pray to a god that is kind and both powerful that he and Mike Martin give us the college football football program FGCU deserves",

When I was in high school and I would tell SOME of my classmates that I would be going to FGCU some would say \"why\" or \"gross\". FGCU is a university and if u just care about getting your degree and possibly making a few friends, the university is perfectly fine. Im not to saying that every degree program is the best as every uni has their flaws, but a degree is a degree.\n\nIn regards to what the OP said, I don't think the diversity is that bad overall on campus, but certain degree programs/colleges like engineering tend to lack in diversity. The holds aren't that weird IMO. For me I only had a lot of holds when I first started but after that didn't have many. \n\nMost of the other cons you stated are geared towards a \"college experience\" which I personally don't care about. If you focus on your studies, hang with friends, or join a club, or get a job; any other free time you have you will prob just want to chill anyways. If youre worried ab being bored, just know that that isn't a worry as you can always find SOMETHING to do.",

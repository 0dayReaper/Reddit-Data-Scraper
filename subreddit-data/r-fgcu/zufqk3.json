There are department kitchenette for faculty and staff to take a break, deal with lunch, make coffee, etc\u2026.\nGo in to them and search the cabinets for that mug. When you find it - explain your situation to someone from the closest offices and offer to buy it. My guess is they\u2019ll give it to you. Definitely ask before taking.",

            "comment": "I actually had Rottig for multiple classes. He\u2019s definitely a passionate professor, more focused on you learning from the class than actual course work. He\u2019s always out of country so an email response can be hard to get. There\u2019s only Exams and a class paper or presentation. He\u2019s not a harsh grader but don\u2019t expect allot of guidance in the assignment. I finished with As in both classes because i participate in class and just connect with him. He actually is in charge of the travel abroad program so I went with him to Bolivia. He\u2019s definitely a good professor if you want a good connection for the future. If you want a standard professor this might not be your guy.",

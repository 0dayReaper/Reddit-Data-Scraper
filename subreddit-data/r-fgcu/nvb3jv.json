Also try your best to take summer classes as a transient student at a community college because it is cheaper and the professor will probably be easier. Get statistics and/or all of your hard classes out of the way (biology, human anatomy, microbiology, etc but not all at once of course)",

Make friends with the smart people (this is kinda where I went wrong with my study group \ud83d\ude05) bc they\u2019ll share all their tips/notes which are always detailed &amp; super helpful. have fun once in a while! Nursing school is stressful &amp; hard. Take a break or you\u2019ll stress yourself out. Ask questions frequently, there is no dumb question. The first semester is the hardest. Once you get past that, it eases up a little :)",

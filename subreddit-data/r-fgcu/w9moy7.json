Also is it worth it to live on campus cuz i have family \\~15 mins away so I can also commute but also kinda want the \u201ccollege experience\u201d to an extent (I love how its all apartment style and private rooms!)",

                    "comment": "ok. I was thinking that, but the reason I asked about commuting was because of people having a hard time getting a dorm; is that just upperclassmen or do freshmen also have a hard time? As of now I don\u2019t really have a preference as to where I want to live, not sure if some dorms are more popular than others",

Not sure how long it\u2019ll take, but *maybe* early September? Could be sooner tho.  What do you think?",

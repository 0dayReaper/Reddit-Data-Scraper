I remember wanting to take it because I minored in chemistry but couldn't because it didn't satisfy a credit in the minor or as a class for science majors. It's probably not too heavily detailed in chemistry and I've heard good things about it. My gf is president of cooking club and the professor who teaches the class helps them run the club and from what she told me he's very nice.",

You learn really basic cooking skills and the science behind them. Eat week we would have reading on a specific chaoter/topic in the book, then he or a classmates would present the info in class, then you go into the kitchen with your group and execute what was learned",

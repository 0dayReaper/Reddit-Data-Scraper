            "comment": "It\u2019s a good business school, I felt like the professors were knowledgeable, helpful, and well experienced. Some majors are significantly better than others. For example, a finance or accounting degree will be more difficult, but will place better than a general management degree. In terms of academics I felt that I was well prepared joining the workforce and even a step ahead of some peers. \n\nA large downside I would say is that there isn\u2019t a ton of corporate jobs in Fort Myers so the school doesn\u2019t have a great job placement network yet. This also affects the availability of internships. I would imagine in 10 years or so that will change with the WFH dynamic and the school growing in popularity and maturing age wise. That being said, a lot of grads move to Tampa, Orlando, and East coast post grad. I moved to a major out of state business hub and didn\u2019t really have a hard time landing a gig. - 2019 BS Finance Grad",

Most student led organizations do some sort of volunteer work and fulfill the requirement in a semester or two. \n\nNot specifically a higher GPA, but the students are required to get a B or higher in the introductory major class (Corporate finance, or managerial accounting). These classes are statistically the most difficult classes in the gen ed requirements so many students don\u2019t fulfill that requirement and default to the management degree.",

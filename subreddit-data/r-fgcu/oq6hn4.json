I don't have any of the acceptable reasons to cancel my contract, so instead I'm just going to get kicked out. I don't want to do anything illegal because I am graduating this semester and I don't want to ruin my life, just get out of this shitty dorm. \nDoes anybody know anyone who has been kicked out of housing? And how did they do it?",

Even if you got kicked out without consequences, they would probably still charge you the full agreement's worth of rent because you signed the contract. Shitty situation, I know. Maybe try contacting the university ombud office?",

I wouldn\u2019t recommend trying to get \u201ckicked out\u201d because the only way to get kicked out of housing (if someone else knows of another way feel free to comment) would be to get suspended or expelled.\n\nLast year I got suspended for a covid related violated violation and thankfully I was able to appeal it and do some sanctions and I was fine, but initially they were saying I would have to move out of housing, I wasn\u2019t allowed to go to class or turn in homework so obviously they\u2019d make me fail my classes and if I went on campus they\u2019d call campus police. It was ridiculous given I had stepped into my hallway while having covid and locked myself out, and when I called the RA on call they reported it.  It was really scary because after so many phone calls they told me that I\u2019d lose the money I had already paid for housing, tuition, my meal plan etc. \n\nSo please please do not get suspended it would just make things a lot more difficult and it would impact your college career and possibly future career plans. If at all possible I\u2019d suggest living on campus for the duration of your housing contract and then move off campus next year. I\u2019m routing for you!",

They should have just put you in the quarantine room so you don't infect your poor roommates then let you move on with your life like the adult you are.",

There\u2019s a few directors of different things and if you pester them with all that they can do it. One of FGCU\u2019s selling points for housing is that the contract can be broken under circumstances but it can be broken. I know it\u2019s possible but like I said, you just gotta pester them and honestly man include the head FGCU people, you can ask for meetings for almost anyone at FGCU even president martin (he\u2019s harder to get a meeting with but you can)",

I hated it you sleep in a closet, they have the smallest dorm rooms out of all the housing options. If your daughter is living in Palmetto hall her bedroom is bigger then in North lake. The carpet is disgusting only time I didn't wear shoes was when I was laying in my bed. The bathrooms (I had the walk-in shower) has this nasty grey tile and is super tiny. Not all buildings in North lake are the same design and layout so that can be considered as well. I hear people say good things about living in North lake, but it's all bad memories for me. My situation is a complicated which is why I'm trying to break this lease I shouldn't have started, but I was in a tight spot and made a dumb decision.",

You can actually stay in Osprey if you choose to live on a floor designated for sophomores. Personally I loved sovi so I did that for a semester. If possible, and if getting to and from campus isn't an issue (there are also shuttles), West lake is the place to go. Has their own bathroom, larger rooms, and basically a walk-in closet. North Lake is the alternative, which is what pretty much most people go to after freshmen year. The rooms really aren't too bad, but it's definitely a cozy living situation. The perks of North Lake is how close it is to campus, you can be on the waterfront or next to it,  and pretty much most of the people from year 2/3 live there (excluding commuters) so it's nice to be able to walk to friends places. Do note that some buildings ARE better than others. I know some places have hardwood floors and others carpet (though that may have changed over summer). Either way, hope your daughter enjoys her time at Uni! Sorry for the essay!",

I will tell her to do a little research, but maybe West Lake will be the way to go unless she truly loves SOVI and wants to stay.",

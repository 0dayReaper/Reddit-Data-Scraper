    "postText": "Made a throwaway to post the same thing I just posted on Facebook Campus, so if you already saw this there, sorry lol.\n\n---\n\nHey everybody, \n\nThis is a long shot, but has anyone found a round gold pin with a picture of an owl and some words engraved on it? It\u2019s about the size of a nickel. I\u2019m pretty sure it fell off my bag on main campus or somewhere in North Lake sometime in the past week. I wish I had a narrower timeframe, but I only noticed it was missing yesterday. \n\nI checked the Lost &amp; Found in the library, ~~but I don\u2019t know where any others are located/if they even exist. (If you\u2019re aware of any, please let me know &amp; I\u2019ll check them as well.)~~ Almost forgot to say, if you happen to know whether there\u2019s a Lost &amp; Found for stuff that gets left on the shuttle, that would be super helpful. Edit: Ok I found out where they are, but I still don\u2019t know if there\u2019s one for the shuttle. \n\nIt\u2019s not monetarily valuable, but it has a lot of sentimental importance to me &amp; I\u2019m kicking myself over not fastening it more securely. \n\nIf by some miracle you found it or suspect you know somebody who did, please reply or DM me! If necessary, I can prove it\u2019s mine. There are unique numbers on the back and I know them. Thanks so much.\n\n---\n\nI realize that it\u2019s really unlikely that it\u2019ll turn up, but I wanna try.\n\nAlso, I didn\u2019t say this on Facebook in case it came across too aggressively lmao, but\u2026\u2026the odds of somebody else having this particular pin are reeeeeaaaally slim. So if you remember seeing a pin fitting this description on somebody\u2019s bag &amp; it *wasn\u2019t* mine (I\u2019m a short blond dude w/ a black backpack), if, in response to you bringing up this post, they say they bought it, that\u2019s extremely sus. And again, there are unique numbers on the back that I know. \n\nI even probably still have the order confirmation from like a year ago because I never delete my emails lmfao.",

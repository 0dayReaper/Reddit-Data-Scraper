            "comment": "i think i heard some talks ab them introducing a physics major soon and there being some type of scholarship for it if u do the major since not many ppl do physics. But I don't know much detail ab it tbh. I recently took Physics 2 with a great professor who is very intelligent and someone to meet if you're into space stuff. But he doesn't strictly teach a set of the same classes so I wouldn't base your decision on coming to the college based on just the specific professor. From what I can tell on the website, earth and space science is just a minor so I would suggest contacting someone in the department to see when and if the physics major is going to get introduced if that's what youre interested in.\n\nHeres a list of the contacts for the department:\n\n[https://www.fgcu.edu/cas/departments/cphy/cphyfacultystaff](https://www.fgcu.edu/cas/departments/cphy/cphyfacultystaff)\n\nI would prob email one of the program coordinators for more info.",

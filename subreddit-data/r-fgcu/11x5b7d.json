    "postText": "Hey everyone! \n\nMy friends and I started a Discord server made for gaming. Originally it started as a way to keep in contact with all the amazing people we've met online, but we've recently also added this server to the FGCU Discord Hub in hope we'd get more FGCU students in our server as well. So if casual online relationships are your thing--no problem! There are plenty of people in our server from all over the US. But if you're curious about your fellow students, all you have to do is ask around you'll find a fellow student. \n\nWe look forward to meeting all of you :)\n\nJoin here: [https://discord.gg/yy7ffD4N](https://discord.gg/yy7ffD4N)",

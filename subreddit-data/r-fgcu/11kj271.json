    "postText": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI\u2019m 23M (almost 24) with a BSBA from UCF, and I\u2019m looking to manage a music band.\n\nINFO:\nI play the bass, guitar, piano, and drums* (*not amazing. I can at least keep a beat). I\u2019ve been in band throughout 3rd grade through freshman year of university when I marched with the marching band. If I had to say what my strongest people skill was, it would be my ability to talk to *anyone* about *anything* (source: trust me bro; no really, I just have a lot of consistent feedback around it).\n\nWith that said, I want to put it to good use and help a band with the following:\n\n- Scheduling gigs/events\n- Organizing band practices/rehearsals (ensuring they are all productive set.\n- Create Roadmaps to track progress\n- Manage Marketing Channels\n- Accounting* &amp; Finances (I am not an an accountant, but I\u2019m pretty good at organizing and recording data. I will work in the best of the team to achieve success).\n- Establish/maintain/retain professional connections with our contractors.\n- AND MORE! *All will be discussed eventually*\n\nI am willing to share an entire resume for serious inquiries only (over discord voice and/or in person). \n\n**Why should we choose you?** Well, my best response is that I have experience, skills, knowledge in, and a passion for music. Most importantly, I have a passion for providing the right tools/resources to help others succeed. \n\nWe can still discuss music preferences, but to really sum it up: if I like it, recognize something unique, and/or think for any reason that the band members themselves have potential, then I\u2019m more than happy to work with you and to do what I can to help you succeed.\n\nIf granted the opportunity, it would be great to practice my skills, utilize knowledge, make a second source of income, meet some cool, like-minded, hardworking dreamers, fulfill a dream of my own - which is to be a part of something extraordinary, and to hopefully make some good friends. \n\nDM if interested. Thank you.",

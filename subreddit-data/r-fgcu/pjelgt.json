            "comment": "Definitely talk to your professor during office hours and try to put a little extra time into understanding the material. If you\u2019re a business major you\u2019re going to have to take Managerial Accounting as well as Business finance and they both build off what you\u2019ll learn in FA. Quizlet definitely has some good stuff but if you\u2019re looking for shortcuts for FA you\u2019ll be shooting yourself in the foot for the later classes. Good luck",

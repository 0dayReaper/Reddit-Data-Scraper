Would scoff or laugh at the aspect of voting. \n\nMost but not all. \n\nFor example , my personal favorite was when they had a pie day thing you had to pay for and over a megaphone said \"dont register to vote , just pay to pie one of us\" \n\nI think some of the frats are secretly in the closet too , with all that butt slapping amongst each other. Idk why they haven't come out yet. (This is suppose to be a comical relief)",

I do agree with the fact that they are extremely entitled and that their parents did not raise them to appreciate money or how to take care of themselves and learn some self-decency. So mix dozens, if not hundreds of guys like that and their bound to be bad influences on each other.",

Just because someone is in greek life or is republican doesn't make them racist. Yes there might be assholes but most of them are not. I'm not bootlicking anyone here and I hate greek life as much as you believe me. I don't understand why you're being so aggressive. I believe you when you say that most bigots you've met are in greek like but if I were to tell you that most people that don't tip me at work are minorities I won't say that 75% of minorities are cheap never tip because that would be racist and I should be fired. Chill out. PS as a republican I can tell you that I think whoever put them up are douchebags and that they should be expelled and that any normal person in my party would do the same thing. It's probably a 4chan edgelord if anything because any normal person doesn't actually believe this stuff. The idea that most right wingers are hitler apologetics is just nonsense.",

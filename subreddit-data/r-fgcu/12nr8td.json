    "postText": "Hello! Posting this for my little bro. I am looking for short term housing for the summer only in the FGCU/ Fort Myers area for my brother (a UF Business student) who got an internship offer. We\u2019re looking to see if we can find cheap student apartment housing, not looking to overtake a full year lease. We\u2019d need it from May 28th-August 5th! Range $400-800, prefer males only but optional and required own bathroom and room.  Please let me know if anyone has anything!",

            "comment": "I truly wish you and your brother good luck but I want to let you know that between the population boom in our area and many homes being damaged or destroyed during ian your $400-800 range is likely very unrealistic. 1 bedroom and studio apartments are 1.5-2k per month right now, hopefully you find someone who has a low lease and a room or couch to spare, but I wanted to give you a heads up that it's not an easy ask.",

I know a lot of the RAs do little events since they\u2019re trying to be welcoming to the incoming freshmen, but besides those things it wasn\u2019t really anything you could \u201cmiss out\u201d on. \n\nI\u2019m also moving into NLV (sophomore) btw. What\u2019s your major? Maybe I\u2019ll see you around :)",

It was right after forensic investigator (my major is forensic studies) on my list. I\u2019m a total history buff so if you love history then it makes sense to go that route.\n\nI always recommend getting a better/clearer idea of what exactly you wanna do before going to college. For some people it works out to be undecided their first year, but the classes are very competitive here. You sometimes gotta fight tooth and nail to get in a required class for your major (in my experience). If you\u2019re going in undecided, at least get all your humanities, Comp1/Comp2, math courses, CLWSs, and/or INKNs done first, since those are required for ALL students.",

Graduated a few years ago, but those are still some of my closest friends.\n\nMy ex of 4 years lived in North Lake her freshman year and says that is the biggest thing she feels like she missed out on.",

That's the real money maker with regards to meeting people. \n\nOnce you find your niche, it'll start to turn into the best time of your life. I did improv and quidditch and those were the perfect fits for me.",

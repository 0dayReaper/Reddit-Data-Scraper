There is a poke stop by Sugden, in the library, by the nursing building where the water fountain is, one by engineering building at the structure, one by AB7, and I think 2-3 more across main campus that I can't remember exactly where. There is also another gym I believe by where the busses stop. ",

Definitely recommend, it's the majority of what I do between class. Main academic block has a ton of pokestops as well, you'll encounter tons of pokemongo players.",

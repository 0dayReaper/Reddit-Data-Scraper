    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m an incoming freshman considering a degree in music therapy.  I was wondering if there were any current or past music students who could tell me about their experience in the Bower School of Music, and how they think it might stack up against UCF, UF, or FSU\u2019s school of music since there is no way to visit because of COVID.  I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for it, any information is appreciated.  Thanks!",

Just curious, you listed UCF, UF and FSU, do those schools also have music therapy programs? Or were you just wanting just considering their music school?",

We just got a new Professor: Dr. Sena Moore and she is everything you could ever want in a Professor. All of us MT students are pretty friendly and the school is pretty generous about scholarship money compared to bigger ones",

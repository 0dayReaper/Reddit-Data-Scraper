Just email honors @ fgcu.edu and ask if you can apply, somebody will reply and you'll probably be sent an application link right away, or be sent through whatever the proper channels are for new students.\n\nYou have to propose a TED Talk for the application as well, that's probably the trickiest part, but as long as you can make it engaging and intelligible, you'll be fine. Connect it with an academic interest that you can talk about or teach and you'll be golden.\n\nThe interview process basically has you talk to three honors college faculty and show that you understand the Honors Elements, which you can read about on the website.\n\nSource: I'm an FGCU Honors student as of spring 2022.",

I just never knew anyone in the honors college who actually gained anything extra from it, besides for the sense of community and I guess looks good for med school and law school. You do get a stole and a band for grad walk I think?",

    "postText": "Hello, I'm currently a sophomore at FSW and I'm on track to graduate FSW in Fall 2023. I'm currently apart of the honors program there which allows me to transfer directly into the FGCU Honors college HOWEVER I haven't met my certificate goal yet and to achieve it I would need to stay at FSW an additional semester. Thank you academic advisors at FSW \n\nWhile I dont have issues transferring to FGCU a semester later I really rather not if the benefits aren't worth it as while my time at FSW has been fine I'm getting FOMO watching my peers transfer without me and I know staying at FSW wouldn't get me where I want to be. \n\n\nFor background on me, my major is currently undecided but I'm wanting to go into veterinary medicine so I will most likely major in biology or chemistry. I have some interest in study abroad but I'm not sure about doing research projects \n\nThank you for the advice!",

            "comment": "In my opinion, it\u2019s not worth adding an additional semester to get into it. It has its benefits: scholarships, grants for research, and internship opportunities, but I don\u2019t see too much of a difference between honors student\u2019s success and regular student\u2019s. There\u2019s also requirements to stay in the honors program and depending on how good of a student you are they may be tough to maintain, especially if you are planning to be a pre-professional biology student.",

The only thing that really piques my interest is the scholarships, tbh because my standardized test scores aren't high enough for anything like bright futures. The priority registration also piques my interest, but again, the cons way outweigh the pros. I'm going to talk to some more people, but this helps a ton",

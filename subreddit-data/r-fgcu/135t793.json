The use remote cameras to track wildlife and identify them. You can do all the work remotely, they have you look at pictures/ videos and if there\u2019s something in it you just place it into a separate folder. It\u2019s really easy work and you can do it on your own time. I do believe they make you go through a zoom orientation just to teach you about the sorting process! I worked over 150 hours with them. I highly recommend!",

            "comment": "My degree is from the early 2000s so my views may be outdated on the current offerings.  I have a CIS degree, it was about 60/40 or 50/50 between technical classes and business classes, depending on your electives and how you classify some of the courses I took.  \n\nAs for career paths, Lots of IT jobs that have direct contact with the business are good, but you might have the skills to go into software, or DBA or Networking or what have you.  So typically, Quality Assurance/Quality Engineer, or Business Analyst type role is likely.  Myself, I've always worked in a tier 2/tier 3 application support type position.  Essentially, in enterprise software, when a problem is found by a user, I determine whether they are using it wrong, if there is a data issue that needs to be fixed, or if there is a bug in the software.  Then, if possible, I fix it, or start the steps for the Software team to fix it.  I'm also responsible for making sure jobs and processes that the business needs done, get done.\n\nHonestly though, with this degree, any business that uses technology (pretty much anything now a days) would have a spot for you to do something for them.",

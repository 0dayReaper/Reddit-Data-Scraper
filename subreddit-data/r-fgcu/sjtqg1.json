    "postText": "Hi everyone! I just got accepted into FGCU today and I was wondering what the best housing options were. I have seen a lot of posts like this, but I was hoping for the most recent information as I saw that some of the apartments have frequent management changes. The ones that I have been looking into include The Reef, Coastal Village, University Village, West Lake Village, and North Lake Village. I will be coming in as a graduate student. I have heard mostly negative things about The Reef and Coastal Village, though I wanted to make sure that things weren't better now. I would love to hear more about different people's experiences with these apartments/dorms and how the roommate situation worked out (I think I saw that all of these do roommate matching?). I would really like one where I can have my own bedroom and bathroom, an in-apartment kitchen and laundry, and ideally internet/water could be included in the rent. Thank you!",

It\u2019s on the pricey-er side but everything is included in rent with an electricity cap. It\u2019s fully furnished and has great amenities plus free printing. I lived there for two years during undergrad and have no complaints. Management is great and maintenance was always quick. Campus is also a short walk away!",

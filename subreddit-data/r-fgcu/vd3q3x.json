That being said, FGCU has very little name recognition outside of Florida. In terms of resume impact if you\u2019re looking to check a qualification box then FGCU will be fine, if you\u2019re looking to significantly set yourself ahead of other candidates I would lean towards schools with more name recognition and stronger alumni networks. Can\u2019t think of anybody from my undergrad who is significantly ahead of others due to their MBA from FGCU. IMO I would rather spend the money and get a top 50 MBA vs an MBA anywhere else because of ROI.",

I\u2019m 30 years old making about 90k right now in a healthcare sales niche market role, but looking to relocate so the money won\u2019t follow more than likely. The FGCU MBA is about 12kish. I don\u2019t think I could sacrifice going that much into debt for a top school where I could pay my way through with FGCU. Just hoping it would be a door opener to make that money follow if that makes sense? The cost is a big concern for me",

Whereas there wasn\u2019t much that on FGCU\u2019s I could find. They have a project management degree I\u2019d be interested in and FGCU has a leadership management degree. They\u2019re both basically the same price. I figured LSU would be a more recognizable name or I could be wrong with the (S) subset",

                    "comment": "I actually enjoyed LSUS and the structure was there. They advertise 10-11 month graduation if you take 2 classes at a time. Realistically just take 1 a time and you can get done still in a reasonable amount of time. There\u2019s some classes you could double up but I wouldn\u2019t push it. The only way you could do that is if you weren\u2019t working. I started in March 2021 and got done in October 2022 with a 4.0. I just put it on my resume I graduated from LSU with an MHA degree since I focused on healthcare business curriculum. I was working a high paid sales job at the time and I paid 1250 cash every 7 weeks so I didn\u2019t have to take loans too. Not sure if that\u2019s your situation but also a factor why I picked them.",

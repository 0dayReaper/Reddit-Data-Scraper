I'm asking about how easy it is to transfer, I currently am going to St Petersburg College rn and am looking to transfer, since it's a lower level transfer I have to meet freshman requirements and the minimum score on the SAT for freshman is a 1070 and I have a 1040. Other than that I have a pretty good gpa and etc, any recommendations or tips?",

But it also is a very easy school to make friends, given you are willing to get out from your shell. There are many opportunities to be social! Lots of events; it is clear they want students to mingle and connect. Also, of course, the environment is heavily considered here which is a plus. Leans quite liberal, but that is every liberal arts college. Greek life is not impressive as it is at most other schools, but there is club and bar life quite close to campus and a great way to spend weekend nights. Best of luck!",

Went to u Tampa yesterday- everywhere you look there - students.   An alive energy.   Less students go there.   Back at fgcu to figure this out today.   Maybe there\u2019s a lot of online and commuter students in their numbers?    Fgcu has so much to offer and we\u2019re just trying to figure out if she\u2019ll be joining a campus of two thousand or 13000 if she decides to go here.   Thanks again.",

My job supports a client in Schenectady and I've made the trip back and forth.\n\nBest thing is there are a handful of companies that have national presence in the area, so getting a valuable internship will be easy and who knows, maybe you'll decide to stick around post grad and work for one of them. Gartner, Herc, Hertz, Arthrex.\n\nBad thing is this isn't a college town. There are some, but not many options for night life. Cost of living (outside of student living) is higher than average and the economy is still based around the service industry which caters to people who live here part time when it gets too cold up north.",

I do not feel like a number, like I know I would have at a school like UCF.\n\nEdit: I also feel like I need to say that UCF had a reputation at my old school which was essentially a feeder to UCF as being known as U Can't Finish. My adviser at that school spent 7 years because of UCF bullshit, on a degree that should have taken 4 years. Take that warning as you will.",

You are realistically looking at Summer 2022 at the earliest to start at another Florida state school.  FGCU is awesome though, tbh.",

But FGCU has a very heartwarming staff that I don't think you'd get at another, larger state university. Class size is also great. Either way spending that year here will probably help you make up your mind on if you want to stay or transfer. I wish the best!",

Come in the Fall, do well in all of your classes and just apply while you\u2019re down here. \nI will say though, as someone that came from a bigger school (UCF) and actually transferred out to FGCU, FGCU is much better. Smaller class sizes, better research opportunities, combined labs/lectures. Depending on your career goals (I\u2019m looking to go into the health field) this school has been a blessing.",

I loved every minute of it and aside from not having a college football team to root for, I wouldn't trade my experience there for anything.\n\nI get why you're wanting to transfer but I do recommend going in with an open mind and a willingness to make an effort to enjoy it.\n\nGood luck!",

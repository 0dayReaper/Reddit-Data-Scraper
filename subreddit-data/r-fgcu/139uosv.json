    "postText": "I live in north ft myers so this isn't a location problem. I'm 19(F) and I had no intention on going to college until recently. I was wondering if local Cc's were better to shave off the price of a bachelor's or if I should ride all the way through FGCU. I have felt very discouraged finding information, as I have absolutely no reason to party, drink, or really anything other than getting my diploma and moving on. I'm very poor so I have a pretty forgiving fafsa score but I'm not eligible for scholarships. I will probably end up doing business, as, I'd rather maximize my career choices. I cannot drive, which is why I wondered if I should do fgcu because at least I could live on campus and driving wouldn't be an issue. I'm epileptic so I'm (currently and probably will continue to be) disqualified from driving, it's not my choice but who would want to drive in this hell anyways. And living in a dorm will get me out of my parents place for now and might help me stop being hiki NEET. I fear if I did CC (probably online since I have no reliable transportation, and honestly I don't trust the public transport here) I would end up becoming more depressed and reclusive and honestly I have no information about the cc's here because there simply isn't any and most of them are heavily focused on trades and nursing, which I have no desire for. I would love to have more info if anyone has advice, I really want a better life for myself and I deserve that much at least.",

            "comment": "The closest thing to CC we have around here seems to be FSW it might be a little cheaper to do two years there and then transfer over to FGCU you would also shave off 40 hours of the full 80 on the service learning hours (fancy for volunteer work) required to graduate. You can dorm at FSW so you don\u2019t need to do anything online if you don\u2019t want to.\n\nI know you said you didn\u2019t qualify for any scholarships but just in case look at some of the things here. \n\nWork study program: https://www.fgcu.edu/admissionsandaid/financialaid/undergraduate/typesofaid/federalworkstudy\n\nTransfer scholarships: https://www.fgcu.edu/admissionsandaid/undergraduateadmissions/scholarshipsandwaivers#TransferScholarshipsOutofStateTuitionWaiver\n\nHousing scholarship: https://www.southernscholarship.org",

My daughter got a tuition waiver and with her additional financial aid, I'm only paying $800 for her to attend this fall. And we don't have to take out loans and she's living on campus. \n\nIt might be too late to apply to FGCU for this fall so definitely do the FSW 2+2 plan.",

The only thing about FSW is they only have 5 bachelors programs so if you want a 4 yr degree &amp; don't want to make a whole new set of friends after 2 yrs you might want to start at FGCU. But Archi (who posted above) has some good points. Both sound amazing! Good luck!",

That's a big wave",

What year were you here\n\n\nWhat I want to see is in a airport across the country to see the FGCU logo to give them a hearty Go Eagles or something similar \n\nIn other universities across the country like Alabama, Auburn, Michigan State, Georgia among others \n\nIt\u2019s a great feeling to hear a stranger to say that because you may leave FGCU but FGCU never leaves you",

Shits crazy to see. \n\nFGCU is such a unique school with such a unique atmosphere, and unique experiences. No matter where I end up, I'll always be happy I decided to come here instead of a school like UCF.",

She\u2019s actually the nendoroid I have had the most problems with (both of her hands broke and even after fixing them she\u2019s super hard to get into her box poses) so I definitely do not recommend paying her aftermarket which, last i checked, is insane. Seems like every video game nendo is getting a rerelease though so I think it\u2019ll happen!",

            "comment": "For GoodSmile Global, you can't combine orders, which means that every order you have will have a 2000 yen flat shipping no matter the size of the figure. All orders will be shipped separately unlike AmiAmi where you can combine them\nEdit:for payment,you will be charged couple of days before the release date of the figure",

In this case, products in your order will be divided into separate shipments of similar release dates. Shipping fees will only be charged for the first shipment, and the GOODSMILE ONLINE SHOP will cover all additional shipping costs.\n\nIs this a remnant of when you were still able to do combined orders and they just forgot to remove this? Because it makes it seem like you can combine orders from different release months and only pay shipping once.",

Us varies (it looks like their 50% off preorder shipping might have come back)",

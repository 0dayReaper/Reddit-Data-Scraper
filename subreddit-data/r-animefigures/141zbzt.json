While a 1/8 Heero Yuy by Megahouse I saw was sold initially at $120 but was then sold at $80 so I bought it, further vouchers also helped drop its price to $75 so it was a steal for its size. Anyways, I'm on the watchout for the most reasonable price possible for figures and nendos.",

Demon slayer figures for some reason have been lowering in price alot. I found a Kanao 1/7 scale for $27 on AmiAmi and the original price was like $113 I think. Granted there were some broken parts but it was a seamless fix with super glue.",

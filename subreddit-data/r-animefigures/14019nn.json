    "postText": "Quick question just wanted to know if anyone else struggles to pose the AOT nendoroids. I find the odm gear is impossible to get on and to balance the swords in hand while trying to get the other parts to stay in is frustrating. Are most nendoroids like these or are other ones more sturdy/easier to assemble",

Sometimes even attaching the stand to their back was hard. (Un-honorable mention to my Yennifer Nendo, where the flames were too big to go into her hands so I had to sand them down to even get them in and now I dare not to touch her ever again).",

Shopify most likely charges merchants in USD anyway since they\u2019re a US-based company so they\u2019re losing a lot in fees.",

But it can open doors for a company to \"name their own price.\" Which means Solaris can charge more money on a figure in USD than it would've cost in yen. Let's say a figure is 10000 yen. And yen was 100yen=1 USD. Then the figure would be 100 USD. But the currency change could mean that you can get charged 120 USD instead of 100 and so it would mean Solaris is charging 1USD=83 Yen.\n\nBut I still think that people are just sad about not getting a figure for cheap.",

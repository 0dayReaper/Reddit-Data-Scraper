Not the saturation, but seemingly any shade at all, her hair is not supposed to be nearly pure white like that, more like a light pastel pink. I'd return it, assuming you dont want to paint it yourself.\n\nHeres an in hand of the figure properly painted  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/92e2yylbqg4b1.png?width=1536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a2173f2396485f3854f5946b79ba06bce94068c5\n\nHer mfc page shows someone else who had a big defect in their copy of the figure, maybe bad QC on this run.\n\n[https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/3611833&amp;context%5B%5D=itemId%3A1586482](https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/3611833&amp;context%5B%5D=itemId%3A1586482)",

                            "comment": "For something like that hair you could avoid using actual paint and instead use a similarly toned soft pink pastel to color using a makeup brush. Basically you would dust it on as you like. Since the hair is basically just primed white you could just apply this directly. This is a common technique used in garage kits for adding blushing effects to skin, shading areas and also to softly add color to hair. I could recommend a video if you decide to try it. \n\nThose are high quality pastels recommended by many I  the community I linked\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Faber-Castel-FC128224-Creative-Crayons-Assorted/dp/B000OMMN4A/ref=mp_s_a_1_16?crid=30P5XQYIQ9UQT&amp;keywords=soft+pastels+pink&amp;qid=1686093809&amp;refinements=p_36%3A2638326011&amp;rnid=2638325011&amp;s=arts-crafts&amp;sprefix=soft+pastels+pink%2Caps%2C160&amp;sr=1-16",

I was wondering if anyone else that bought this figure had this experience. I was also thinking I was being paranoid since I recently had something else stop working suddenly after having just bought it.",

They tend to be more color saturated, shaded better for detail and look more lively. It's not a surprise to see most mass produced product look more pale than what people would expect. I say you check out on actual customer taken pictures in MFC, and if theirs look different from yours, take the issue to the place of purchase.",

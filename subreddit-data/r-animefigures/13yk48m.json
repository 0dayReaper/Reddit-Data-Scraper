Although I don't think the hexagonal is all that bad, it's just that the clear coloured appearance of them was cheap looking. For example I still really like the Beach Queen bases and they were hexagonal too.",

I agree with the hexagons, it\u2019s not the shape that\u2019s the problem but the colours, I would have preferred them the just make them all a dark black or atleast made them a more solid colour but I imagine that doing that would have brought the price of the bases up.",

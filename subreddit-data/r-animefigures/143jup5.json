Basically to get credit for it, they have to destroy it in some form to where it's not whole when it is disposed of.  After that, it's a rather smart to use it that way since it's getting another use as opposed to just being thrown away.",

It seems to have been from two works, one Girls und Panzer, the other K-On.\n\nI'll flatten out the pages and put them on my pinboard (K-On)/ frame them (GuP), it's the least I can do.\n\nI've come across *many* packaging materials, but manga? It just feels wrong.\n\nHas something like this ever happened to you?",

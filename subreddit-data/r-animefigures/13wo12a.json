Shes missing a hand, her weapon, her base, and her paint is scuffed. Lets quickly work it out:\n\n1. That figure sells for new in box with prime shipping on amazon for 29.99 USD. [https://www.amazon.com/SEGA-Extella-Scathach-Premium-Figure/dp/B07NSK8KY4](https://www.amazon.com/SEGA-Extella-Scathach-Premium-Figure/dp/B07NSK8KY4) If you scower you could probably pay 15-20 for one complete in box off of mercari/ebay.\n2. Hiring a 3d modeller would cost more than buying that new.\n3. Paying someone to print that for you ( assuming you dont own a 3d printer) will cost about what you paid for that figure in the first place.\n4. Then you have to buy acrylic paint, a brush, the right kind of glue to attach and paint it.\n5. And I was only factoring in the hand, you'd have to do all that for the base and weapon as well.\n\nSee if you can return the figure. If you want to mess around with the idea of fixing it within your budget you can get some polymer or air dry clay from hobby lobby or michaels or amazon,  and try to make the missing parts yourself and see if you enjoy sculpting. A 2 oz. brick of clay only cost a few dollars. Theres endless tutorials on how to sculpt anime figures on youtube you can follow along.",

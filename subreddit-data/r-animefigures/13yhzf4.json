The bottom shelf on the display case is usually not as convenient for a viewing angle as the other shelves, so it's usually the not as favorite figures that go there.  \n\nThis figure has been one of my holy grails for a while, but I could never justify the price, lol.  So, I was joking around trying to say how could you put one of my holy grails on the bottom shelf, but I guess it didn't come across that clearly.  I really don't mean anything by it though, I am a big advocate for everyone and anyone is free to enjoy the hobby how they want \ud83d\ude01.",

Sometimes I'm really stuck. you're right that she doesn't have the perfect angle below. i sort the bigger characters by outfit, standard, sexy and special outfits. For me, the focus is on the dreamdoll dolls in this showcase and when the estream is in another compartment, it goes under. if it is at the top, the rest goes under and the overall picture is not as fluid.",

She\u2019s so unique especially for a 1/4 and she has a lot of details. I would definitely recommend her i don\u2019t think you would regret her.",

The pillar is separated on a half circle that clips on to the base which would make this an easy mod to build a full base while keeping the pillar.   I'm tempted to buy a Marble textured tile and use that as custom base",

I know it's already been a long time since she's been released but Mimeyoi's Le Malin impressed me so much.  The detail, sculpt, quality of the figure itself, color palate, aesthetic overall.  But then again it does seem like a waste of money as I wouldn't even display the box or anything.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utathhlsmf4b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4c9371361f01ad07c5f0a8f74b9f916dd4f6f577\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6phs9ilsmf4b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=26373e9aa09271e0d96d169d23e5eb309506a62a",

Unless you are explicitly planning to re-sell in the future, I don't see the actual benefit of having a \"mint in box\" one, especially if it's just stored away somewhere. Just seems like that money could go to something new (more figures, something else).",

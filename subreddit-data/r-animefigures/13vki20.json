    "postText": "I am requesting help with identifying this gashapon from my collection from an Anime highschool girl. It came in several pieces which needed assembly as usual. It is the only figure I am unable to find information about. I bought the gashapon most likely from either the Belgian webstore Archonia or at an Anime Convention booth around early to mid 2000's.\nUnfortunately the stand doesn't offer much info either, no company name. Just the country of release \"China\" with either number 8. or letter B. and the number 6 underneath.",

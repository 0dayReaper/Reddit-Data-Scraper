I would greatly appreciate any ideas or tips as to how and where to pack her so she stays safe during the flight.",

I did this once with a polystone figure (but not from Japan). \n\nIf not, disassemble as much as possible and put each part in bubble wrap/packing paper. You can buy a cardboard box to help defend against crushing damage. You can use clothes as general padding but for me I'd prefer bubble wrap as the inner layer. I took some with me the two times I've been to Japan \ud83d\ude06\n\nSo possibly a Daiso trip in the todo list \ud83d\ude06",

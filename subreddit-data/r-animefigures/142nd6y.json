When the LED lights are off, you've got a mirror door hiding your figures.\n   2. When the LED lights are on, you've got a sexy figure display.",

I'm currently toying around with detolf design.\n\nI took measurements of each glass panel and worked with [https://ostersmartfilm.com/](https://ostersmartfilm.com/) to have the PDLC smart film made. I gave them the measurements and where on the film I wanted the bus bar to power the film so that it could be hidden most efficiently. The company is based in China but they were awesome to work with and the film was cut exactly as described. \n\nOnce I  received the film, it was just a matter of placing it on the glass which is very similar to placing window tint, just way thicker. Using a proper squeegee applicator and going slowly is the key to no air bubbles. \n\nThen it was just a matter of wiring everything up. The terravault cabinet has cable channels for its own lighting so I just shared the space with some 24AWG 2 wire to each panel and connected it to the transformer that oster provides with the film using JST connectors. The transformer is remote controlled and has 6 banks you can power separately or all at once. I chose to split each cabinet in 2 and the tv stand on its own for a total of 5 banks I can control individually. \n\nI can provide more details and short vid of the cabinets in action if desired.",

You could tell people there's light sensitive collectibles under there if you really needed to, like boxed Star Wars toys, old fragile books, or something that you think they'd find uninteresting. I'd just say get an artistic or cute print so that it looks natural with your room. Make sure you have some art on your walls too, so it doesn't look out of place.",

All of our friends know who we are and know what they are getting into being our friends \ud83d\ude02 We aren't ashamed of it, nor do I honestly have time/patience anymore to be around people I would have to hide it from. I'm even in a motorcycle club and threw our end of the year party at my place. Didn't give them a heads-up at all. They were a little shocked, but more impressed than anything. They still want me to host every semester now haha. So even the \"cool\" kids in one of my friend circles didn't care at all. Now they just tell everyone \"wait til you see their house!\" It might as well be a initiation at this point haha. \n\nThat being said, I am by no means implying you are ashamed or anything like that. I can understand being in a situation where hiding it makes life easier (much like certain tattoos). If I wanted to hide mine, I would simply make a curtain with Velcro at the top to attach in front of our display cases. I can attach it when people come over. If they look behind it, that's on them. And I can take it down easy if they are gone.  \n\nAs an example, I've considered this for some of our videos that we don't want to mark as 18+ and want to hide them from view. I've even considered using magnet tape and a light diffuser to do the same task to effectively blur those cabinets. \n\nBest of luck OP \ud83e\udd1f just remember, if possible, to prioritize your own happiness first.",

The facial feature really capture her actual looks and I really like the pose she's in. \n\nThe only complain I would say is that while most of the coloring is on point like the small details in her buns or the tips of her ribbon, some of the yellow strips on her dress doesn't feel very consistent, like some areas of the strips are thicker or thinner particularly on the folds of her dress. But it's just really small details and you won't notice it unless you dissect the figure. \n\nI think you should definitely pick one up for a reasonable price and expect that you're getting a POP figure. Most importantly for me anyways is that she looks amazing, it's a great pose and an iconic character in her iconic outfit.",

            "comment": "I'm surprised they're allowed to show prices without taxes included. You need to select your country (to show the relevant shipping options, they say) and then they don't include taxes.\n\nAnyway, they want 282 euro for Kawasima Ami (the black 1/4 Toradora bunny), which would come to about 340 euro (with 21% VAT, NL). Global Freaks wants 380 and other shops 400+, I think.\n\nI find the gap between 340 and 380 a bit suspicious - they say taxes not included, but does that mean only VAT or also import taxes (4.7 or 6%)? Will it be sent from Europe, or do you buy from them and then they have it drop-shipped from China?",

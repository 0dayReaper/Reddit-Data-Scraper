    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019ve been collecting figures for a couple years and have a small collection now. I\u2019m about to move to Japan, and unfortunately I can\u2019t bring them along with me. I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019ll be gone, and I want to make sure that I store them properly so they don\u2019t get sticky from sitting in a box for a long time. What is the best way to store them? (For a time frame, I might be gone from a few months to a few years).",

            "comment": "The risk of figures \"getting sticky\" isn't really an issue. Figures that have been our of the box for years and newer figures are going to have fewer issues with plasticizer anyway. Rather, the bigger issue is moisture and the impact on boxes and potential mold. I have stored figure boxes in ambient storage for about 6 months in the US Midwest without issue, but I wouldn't risk it with figures themselves. They would *probably* be safe, but you shouldn't cut corners with an expensive collection.",

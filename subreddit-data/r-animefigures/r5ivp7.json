The notice may describe all or a portion of the property, but the limitation of liability provided by s. 715.11 does not protect the landlord from any liability arising from the disposition of property not described in the notice, except that a trunk, valise, box, or other container which is locked, fastened, or tied in a manner which deters immediate access to its contents may be described as such without describing its contents. The notice shall advise the person to be notified that reasonable costs of storage may be charged before the property is returned, and the notice shall state where the property may be claimed and the date before which the claim must be made. ***The date specified in the notice shall be a date not fewer than 10 days after the notice is personally delivered or, if mailed, not fewer than 15 days after the notice is deposited in the mail.***\n(3) The notice shall be personally delivered or sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the person to be notified at her or his last known address and, if there is reason to believe that the notice sent to that address will not be received by that person, also delivered or sent to such other address, if any, known to the landlord where such person may reasonably be expected to receive the notice.\n\nYou have 10 days after receiving notice to pick up your shit.\n\n&gt; My so would rather pay me back than testify against \"blood\n\nIf y'all broke up, does it matter who's money it is?\n\nAlternatively, do you have renter's insurance? (The insurance company may file a subrogation claim, meaning they'd sue on your behalf to recover the damage they paid you).\n\n&gt; It's a super long story but we don't have video or any physical proof he did it.\n\nCivil cases have _much_ laxer evidence standards than criminal cases. The standard is met if the proposition is more likely to be true than not true. I would at the very least consult a lawyer to see if you have a reasonable chance of winning a civil suit.",

You will EASILY be able to get a judgment for the amount of destroyed property. Name everyone in the home as a named party (defendant). It will be on them to prove who didn't destroy the figures, not you proving who did in fact destroy them (since you are roping them all into the lawsuit). Your legal theory is this: \"My personal property was destroyed by XYZ persons. My damages are $X. Thus, I am entitled to relief in $X amount.\" You can try small claims court, but if the damage is in the thousands, I recommend speaking to an attorney to at least get a consultation.\n\nThis is not ok and you CAN get relief. Please pursue your rights. Keep us updated.\n\nEdit: I just noticed you mentioned $20,000 in damage. This is super serious, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get a consultation from an attorney!!! I have not looked it up but I can almost guarantee 30 days whatever bs the police mentioned will not cover a situation like this. This is probably a very fact specific scenario that an attorney can walk you through to get you relief. This was your personal property that was not abandoned due to the break-up. There was a reasonable expectation that you were going to retrieve your stuff. They destroyed your property. You are entitled to relief for your property that they destroyed in retaliation against you.",

People have successfully sued for much less, with considerably less evidence. \n\nIt would be helpful to screenshot, record, and backup anything that may be helpful onto another device. Extensive pictures of the damage and mess included. \n\nBegin making a spreadsheet of your entire collection + your destroyed detolfs, detail the total cost of each figure (retail + what you ended up paying w/ shipping and import + if the figure is more valuable now due to resale/rarity) and detail the level of damage. If you have access to any invoices, I would aggregate them in a folder. Treat it as if you were documenting everything for an insurance claim, be incredibly thorough. \n\nI would also prepare something to show how damage is proven to devalue the figures, not everyone understands they are treated more like collectible cards rather than kids toys or action figures.\n\nA lay person may see some scratches or a snapped base piece and not understand the big deal, they may dismiss it as something fixable and trivial. They may not realize it would be like taking one of those $100-500 cards and folding, creasing or tearing it. \n\nReference the rigid grading systems used by places such as AmiAmi to help get this point across to a lawyer, they may not immediately understand the high cost of your collection or the magnitude of the damage. It is a niche hobby and obviously carries a degree of stigma with it. \n\nFinally, let an attorney decide whether the \"abandonment\" of property is really an issue. Lawyers don't typically pursue what isn't profitable, but do not expect to get 100% of your collection's value back. It is difficult to get people to pay up when they lose in court, and your lawyer will still need their payment for representing you. If you are strapped for cash, see if you can find  a lawyer with a reasonable retainer fee or one that is flexible about paying for their time. Some lawyers work on a gimmick of not getting paid unless they win and you are awarded damages by the court. However, do not rely on this purely hypothetical payout to carry your legal fees - it's not guaranteed.  \n\nAlso, if you were not allowed or prevented from access to your property it is important to provide proof. Being intimidated or asked not to come over counts. Any proof that you reached out and communicated that you wanted your property and had no intent to abandon it would also be great. \n\nI am horrified that you had to experience this, but hopeful that you will receive some level of justice.\n\n*Edited for phrasing*",

The lawyer issue and money issue is something you should consult with different firms.\n\n\nDon't let this issue drag on either. As soon as you are capable, you should prepare a story of what happened, and sent it to various lawyer agencies. See how they reply and I would say, pick the one that you feel can help you out the best. In some cases, with property damage, they should be able to make a case of it and get him to pay a percentage of the lawyer's expenses.\n\n\nIt's just an assumption, but definitely worth the try :/\n\n\nAlso by stepfather you meant the GF's stepfather?

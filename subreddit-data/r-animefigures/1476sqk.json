Does that mean anything, such as different production ones? I just saw a listing that had a slimmer box and wanted to know if it meant anything. Do you guys happen to know anything about why Furyu is inconsistent with the packaging and boxes for these Miku's in particular? There are examples at the bottom showing the difference. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p2xy4ttiog5b1.jpg?width=1442&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=59a2e9173d8975b96eead221ac27a968f258cd58\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ecfh7ttiog5b1.jpg?width=1588&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=766c47c68b198e97768015ad8c447c831010ee77",

            "comment": "I know with the Miku BiCute Black there were 2 different bases (oval and circle shaped) but absolutely nothing indicated what base the figure had. The oval ones had issues where too much weight was in the front and it's very tippy (this is the one I have). I counter-balance it with about 2 dollars worth of quarters taped to the underside of the base.\n\nCould be that one version was the initial release and they only realised after some sort of issue that they fixed with a second version?",

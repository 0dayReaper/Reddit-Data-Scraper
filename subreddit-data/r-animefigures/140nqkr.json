My primary sites are AmiAmi, GoodSmile Global, and Mandarake for pre-owned. \n\nThe yen to cad conversion has been pretty good lately, the only downside is how much the shipping is. There are Canadian stores like Navito World (Ontario) and Hobby Bee (BC) but I have found the markup to be too much for my preference. \n\nIf you're ever looking for China-exclusive figures, there's an Australian site (cant remember the name) that didn't seem that bad but I've never used it personally.\n\nTokyo Otaku Mode can be good for the points/cashback programs if it's the only/main site you use, but again, usd to cad.",

I\u2019ll give them a look also in the future but this one is even more expensive, 215CAD from their store. TOM offered me a $10 off coupon so I\u2019ll probably order from them. \n\nThanks for the help",

Since the order is over 100$, you can get free shipping (and when you do free shipping- they'll mark the value of the figure at a low amount, normally 30$- so you won't get hit with customs / fees / taxes.) Free Shipping is via boat, though - so a few months.\n\nIf you don't want the free shipping- you can still register Premium and put your Birthday as a day in June - you'll get a 10% Off Coupon you can apply to it as well.\n\nYou can't apply the Birthday &amp; Premium Discount with free shipping - unless you add something else - because the total cost would drop below 100$. So the free shipping wouldn't be available.",

I prefer figures that are faithful to the source material. Oda isn't opposed to creating beautiful female characters. There is no need to dial it up to 11 and increase their bust size even more. No disrespect if you love these figures, but they aren't for me, and I'm glad MHs efforts are being spent making figures for newer and throwback characters that are faithful to the manga and anime.",

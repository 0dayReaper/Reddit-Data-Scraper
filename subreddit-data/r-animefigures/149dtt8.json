Also, keep in mind that you can only use points up to 50% of the cost of the figure.",

            "comment": "You'll get the $60 back as $75 of points, so it can be worth it if you have something you already want to spend that money on. TOM does give discounted shipping on orders over $150, so that can be nice. Bear in mind 2 things:\n\n\n1. Stores like AmiAmi and TOM don't fully control their shipping prices. Most of what you pay in shipping goes straight to the carrier (Japan Post, FedEx, etc.), with only some going to the handling part (boxes, warehouse costs, staff, etc.). Shipping is not much different store-to-store.\n2. TOM often marks up the base price of their items, often steeply. This applies double for items in their US warehouse, as they bake Trans-Pacific shipping into the item's price.\n\nCompare multiple stores when you want to buy. Evaluate the *total* price. That's price + shipping + taxes + anything else that applies. Go RIGHT UP to checkout to see what the total is, then see what the price is at Solaris Japan. Then Good Smile. Estimate AmiAmi, since they don't quote shipping upfront (I find they are comparable to SJ). End price is what matters to your wallet.",

And now even that\u2019s questionable, since you can only use points up to 50% of the figure, and they are so overpriced to begin with.\n\nThey *may* be worth it for extremely large figures that are eligible for discounted shipping. But most of the time, their markup + shipping will come out to be more expensive than AmiAmi\u2019s discounted price + full cost shipping.",

            "comment": "If you use TOM use other sites to compare prices etc. I have the 3 month premium and depending on what im ordering it ends up being waaaay cheaper, a few $ cheaper, to being more expensive. For instance i got the Marin shizuku cosplay and it ended up being like $10+ cheaper than everywhere else i was thinking of ordering it. The good and bad thing about TOM is that it can sometimes have figures other sites dont have, but bad because it can be missing other figures a bunch of other sites have. This ended up being in my favor when i preordered some stuff for my fiances christmas/bday gifts and the ones i knew she wanted werent up anywhere else but TOM had them in stock for fairly cheap. The points are the biggest plus for my fiance and i, as they really help lower the prices of figures were already getting cheaper than other sites+ getting points for buying too. My biggest negative from TOM is that they dont do paypay pay in 4, theres some pricier figures my fiance and i wanted that would be $100s cheaper thru TOM but still can't afford to drop $200+/ dont wanna drop $200+ at one time for a figure we know is gonna get snatched up and end up resold for more, pay in 4 has helped us get some really nice figures we wanted from other sites sadly they havent added it back to TOM.",

            "comment": "I have Tom Premium and I think if you're buying a lot of figure products when they go up for pre-order with 15% cash back, it's a good deal. I've been using TOM and I've been able to use about 20-30$ worth of tom points every purchase to get the price exactly to 150$ for free shipping. The membership basically pays for itself in free shipping if you purchase figures often. On more expensive figures like 250$ + I usually look elsewhere unless tom has coupons. Again, make sure to check other sites first in order to make sure you're getting the best deal before you checkout.",

I like to use the points to clear up the shipping (free shipping) and then the figure \n\nNot too bad but you do have to pay the figure upfront",

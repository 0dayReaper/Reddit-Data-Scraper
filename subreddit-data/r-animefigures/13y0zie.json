            "comment": "Depends on what the dust is made of. If it\u2019s dead skin cells (most common), then it shouldn\u2019t leave a mark. If it\u2019s admixed with carbon-based junk (like from vehicular exhaust if you live in a city with poor pollution) or minerals (like sediments from cement and construction work), then yes, that will cause smudging if all you did was take to it with a duster. In these cases, you may need to wash them in soapy water first and then dry them.\n\nFor lights, as long as they are LEDs, they shouldn\u2019t discolor any paints. It is possible for heat to cause paints to fade, but most LED lamps emit minimal amounts of heat. The only way I can imagine it damaging a figure is if it is placed directly in front of a low-quality LED that generates a considerable amount of heat (very unlikely still).",

Basically, be aware of how the dust is accumulating and what it\u2019s made of and use the appropriate method to clean the figures.",

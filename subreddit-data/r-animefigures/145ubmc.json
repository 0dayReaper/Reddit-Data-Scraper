    "postText": "Hi everyone! Just looking to clear some space and downsize my collection for now (this year's catalog is looking stacked). All figures purchased from vendors such as AmiAmi, Taobao via Superbuy (for the China-exclusive figures), Solaris Japan, Mandarake, or through sellers on MFC.\n\nAll opened figures have been displayed in a smoke-free, pet-free home, in a Detolf or shelf away from direct sunlight, and were dusted regularly. Unopened figures / goods were stored in my closet. \n\nIf you have any questions about a specific item or would like to see more pictures, feel free to let me know! :)\n\n**No trades, please. Always open to negotiating prices for the scales! Shipping within the Continental U.S. (ships from Southern Nevada). Feel free to message me your postal (ZIP) code for a shipping estimate. Payment through PayPal only.**\n\n**Verification:** [Pic 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ImKoOuPThAw1O8G7RbsWmtOfh_fkBLI1/view?usp=sharing) [Pic 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nXAkTZOuA9bCi-Bdfj_S6ijF_3xfF2q1/view?usp=sharing) [Pic 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SpU3IlBNH1F_Ou9R5TIlnU7rqOfIEngD/view?usp=sharing)\n\n# SCALE FIGURES\n\n|Figure|MFC Link|Condition|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Fate/Grand Order** \\- Mash Kyrielight - 1/7 - Grand New Year (Aniplex)|[https://myfigurecollection.net/item/645866](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/645866)|Opened and displayed.

For example, if you want alerts for comments you hit the notification button on the comment section. If you want alerts for updates to the item description (eg the release date gets updated when it gets delayed or the exact release date gets announced etc), you go to the bottom and hit the button for the changes section",

Somebody will eventually drop their pre order. I am sure of it.\n\nBut if you find a better way than daily checking then lmk please.",

It's great for tracking what's coming out, ready for preorders.",

As for websites I would recommend [nekomagic](https://www.nekomagic.com/) they have weekly blogs that shows all the upcoming figures that were announced/released that week, and for each figure they show the Manufacturer, Scale, Product Type, Announcement,\nRelease Date, and Price. They are also great with covering events like stated previously. Hope this helps!",

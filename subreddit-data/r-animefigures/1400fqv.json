She has one of the most dynamic poses for a bunny and she\u2019s extremely expensive. I won\u2019t be canceling my PO because of those reasons, she may even go up in price and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she did. Shipping will always be a doozy for her",

She is way too beloved and is the only one of the three to never go down in value.\n\nThe other two, I can see you wait for them to be in the pre-owned. Black Prince will definitely fall in value while Shimakaze is a more open question. This is based on how popular they are in game.",

As an unironic AL player, NJ is pretty much becoming the new poster child of the series so there\u2019s a huge chance aftermarket will go up real high. I\u2019m not sure for the other 2. I guess it trickles down to if you like NJ to keep the PO or to cancel",

Just going off the price most people will not pre order New Jersey unless they are pretty die hard New Jersey fans. Best thing to do is keep checking if the item can be still be preorder or not leading up to the release of it to make your decision. Also pictures of actual figures may change decisions as well.",

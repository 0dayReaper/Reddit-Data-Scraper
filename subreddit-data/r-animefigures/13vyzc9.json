You can withdraw money and get food for cheap if you are ever starving after blowing all your money on figures (talking from experience)\nAnd also some little tips: stand on the left side of the escalator. The right side is for people who are in a rush and are speedrunning the escalator. Wearing mask on public transport is good practice.",

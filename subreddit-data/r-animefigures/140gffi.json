If you never seen her before.\n\nIt's a huge part of her character where she sees herself as this evil Goddess of death and decay when in reality shes just stuck with this job since birth and can never leave meanwhile her other half which is she jealous of wrecks more havoc around the world and is generally more selfish.\n\nThe props specifically the souls cages a unique to her and you won't find them anywhere else.",

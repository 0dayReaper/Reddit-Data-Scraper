I was looking for her and managed to find the seller. The price was standard after to get the figures from 3rd party - which is still MUCH cheaper considering overseas delivery and tax. It's bootleg heaven though so have to be super careful.\n\nI hope that the shop I like which sells \"older\" prizes one day will somehow get her and some others amps. Also there is always a chance that they will rerun her looking at how other amps got reruns too (Latidos for example). Otherwise I gave up on having an easy source to get her. Hope you won't give up so easily and be able to get her.",

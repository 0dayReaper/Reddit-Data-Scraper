    "postText": "(Banpresto Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- Kyunties AI HAYASAKA Figure) \n\nI just noticed my Ai Hayasaka figure on the back of my shelf leaning on the figure in front of it &amp; was shocked to find that her effin feet broke off. I think whatever glue they used wasn't strong enough &amp; gravity just did its thing. Luckily it looks like a clean separation from ankles to shoes, so I can probably glue her back together. Is Gorilla Glue a safe choice or should I use another type?",

I guess sometimes it's cheaper to make the shoe and foot two different pieces with different solid colors than one whole piece to be painted later. So the possible points of failures can be the pegs on the sole, the foot and shoe (in this case), the top of the socks, top of the legs, etc.",

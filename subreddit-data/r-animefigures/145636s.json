For eg, I was looking at One Piece figurines and most of the ones that I liked are the ones whose pre-orders were already closed/being resold for a much higher fee. In the future I wanted to keep an eye on every upcoming release related to One Piece, so if there's any way I can do that, please help me out :)",

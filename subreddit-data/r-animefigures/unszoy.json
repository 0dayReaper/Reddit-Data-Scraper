Go to the scrap book section or look for papers that have designs or card stock. I even printed stuff out at the office. Once you have that you can tape or stick it to the sides/back of your display. \n\nYou can look at the miniature section, they may have fake grass and mini props or if you check the plant section, they may have moss mats.\n\nStart off with an idea, or a theme. The figures don't have to be from the same series but if they give off a vibe try to match it! \n\nGood luck!!",

            "comment": "Why the Detolf is popular:\n\n\\- they are comparable cheap\n\n\\- lots of glas, so figures can be viewed from all angles\n\n\\- modern, simple design, which makes them fit into many types of home designs\n\n\\- can fit into small rooms\n\n\\- popularity lead to lots of tutorials/guides on how to alter it (shelf height, lights)\n\n\\- easily accessable for many people on an international scale (people don't have to start research into local distributers, where they might not know how good the products are)",

            "comment": "For consumers with an IKEA outlet in range, their pricing is pretty reasonable for an enclosed glass cabinet that does not have thick solid frames in the corners. It is common for furniture makers to charge more than triple for glass cabinets of the same specification. Even clear acrylic display cases around the size of 1 Detolf shelf are pretty pricey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou might think they're overrated because you see them a lot in posts but unless you're willing to shell out thousands for custom-made glass cabinets, Detolfs are the next best thing that has the optimal price-to-aesthetics factor. It also helps that customizing them by adding lights, locks or dust-proof weatherstrip are relatively easy too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did read that newer Detolfs are prone to breaking, but I do not know if it is a batch issue or something recent due to change in glass manufacturer to keep their price-point down. Reportedly, the glass is thinner and there has been quite a number of Facebook shattered collections. I can vouch for the 5 cabinets of mine as being sturdy because I always lie down beside them and have accidentally kick each cabinet a few times without any issues.",

                    "comment": "Yeah the newer models aren't as good as the old ones, but if the side panels are shattering it's almost always because the bolts were tightened too much or there's too much weight on top of the cabinet(s). There are stories of people claiming they exploded for no reason, but I have a hard time believing them if I'm being honest, I have 2 detolfs that are over 10 years old and they're still in one piece.\n\nI can't tell how hard someone tightened their bolts, but one thing I see here and in other figure/statue groups often is people placing HEAVY shit on top of their detolfs like prime1, Sideshow, resin statues, etc. and almost every time I see someone with a shattered detolf it's someone who collects something along those lines.",

            "comment": "Display cases are expensive. Detolf\u2019s are still the most bang for your buck purchase available. Sure Milsbo is an option for some, but two detolf\u2019s are still cheaper with the same if not more room. Also not everyone likes having the visual obstructions that come with the milsbo frame.\n\nSeriously, cases are expensive. I make my own custom ones and even though I can make them cheaper than other non-Ikea types, they still end up costing in the $300-$600 range. I can\u2019t touch the Detolf price. It\u2019s made flimsy and can cause worry whether it\u2019ll spontaneously combust but when it\u2019s doing it\u2019s job, it\u2019s the best budget display.\n\nYou can look elsewhere like moducases and others but you\u2019ll find many prices well north of $1,000. \n\n\nAn aside note though. It\u2019s always comical how In this hobby everyone cuts corners with displays. A single bunny is like $300-$350, you\u2019d think a display that would hold say multiple bunnies and other figures would be worth spending some money on lol.",

            "comment": "When it was like $60 it was a good budget option, especially for a new collector. It was my first display case. Before that I had a small shelf. It was really cool to see the glass on all sides and it fit into the only open space I had at that time which was pretty small.\n\nI've since gotten a Milsbo and I like it a lot better. But my Detolf is still pretty nice. I like using it to create backgrounds; I find the box size really good for individual scenes.",

Some people can pull them off really well though and ill admit with how people use them its tempting sometimes to get one myself and an added bonus is you can avoid dust collecting on the figures and whatnot (though i actually enjoy dusting them, its quite relaxing) so i can see why theyre so popular but honestly im just content using a tall bookshelf or wall shelves or the like to display them cause i like to look at them without any kind of obstruction. Just boils down to preference i guess",

They're a lot cheaper to get that way. I even got a 4 foot wide store display case for 100 bucks. Detolfs just can't justify their price to me with how fragile they seem to be, how little space they have and the continuous lowering quality",

Keep in mind ANY US-based shop will potentially be months behind the JP release (although BBTS does seem to be the slowest of all usually). If you want fastest arrival from time of Japan release, ordering from Japan directly with fast (expensive) shipping is needed.",

Some people are getting her already because she's out in Japan, and other stores do get figures faster. But BBTS will get her for you, even if it takes forever (I'm still waiting on a prize that came out in November, and I had to wait 1.5 years for a prize once. That was ridiculous, and I was seriously tempted to cancel &gt;\\_&lt;;).\n\nThat being said, I did get a nendo that was slated for a June release on BBTS only 2 months after Japan. I was shocked. It came out in January in Japan, and I got it in March. So it is possible to get figures from BBTS in a reasonable timeframe. I think it just depends on luck. Maybe Lancer Artoria will show up earlier than they expect?",

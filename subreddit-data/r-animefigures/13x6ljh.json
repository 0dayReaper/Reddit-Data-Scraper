I currently have them inside a detolf.\n\nThey are taking up one shelf at the moment because I haven't figured out a good way to put another figure yet due to them being one next to another. I usually go for a triangle formation.\n\nTheir bases are small for 1/7 scale figures I would say. Misaki's base is just taller, but the space seems minimal. Think two small base 1/7 figures and put them next to each other.",

He\u2019s not particularly interested in my hobby, but is always happy to listen to me go on about it, vice versa with me and his tools and projects. Funny thing about the place we live tho is that they randomly do inspections with very little warning and take pictures of the place. We fucking hate it. So now he and I have begun collecting lewd art, phallic objects, and displaying all of my cast offs in the living room so that they have to take pictures of that and send it to their bosses. We like to be petty in harmless ways. \ud83d\ude02",

My bf seems to like them better for their poseability and for their wider range of characters, since he's a fan of several of the shows I have featured in my Nendo collection. He doesn't understand collecting figures without that connection to the characters as much.",

I\u2019m hoping this effect part is as hard as the portion that\u2019s closer to Wei\u2019s base, but it\u2019s def a good idea to throw on a  support rod from the get-go (if GSAS learned anything, they should at least include one but I doubt they will). He\u2019ll be the last figure with these effects that I\u2019ll get from them, though. Too risky.\n\nEdit: bonus points for them if the effect part is optional! that would be great, because it\u2019s not even necessary for the piece",

I also have the Soft Voice of Spring Azuma (heavy version) pre-ordered. I'm super excited to see how their Unfamilar Duties Perseus comes out and hoping they pick up like Plymouth or Emden.\n\nI never went for the ones you have, but they definitely came out quite nice. I actually almost got Honolulu myself but decided against it.",

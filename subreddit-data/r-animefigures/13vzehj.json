    "postText": "I've always ordered from Solaris which is pretty much a faultless experience. I found a pre-owned figure on AmiAmi and decided to order. It's a 1/4 scale figure so I know shipping to the UK via EMS will cost a bit, but are the shipping costs reasonable on AmiAmi? It's a bit odd that it's calculated separately?",

            "comment": "1. You can always ask for a shipping quote for an instock item before you order\n\n\n2. From a pure shipping calculation perspective, it does make sense for the shipping price to be manually calculated (for example, it's not just the weight but also the size of the package on methods like DHL, if your package ends up being too big for surface limits, how do all the figures fit in a combo order, how much packaging is needed for combination orders etc). It does make it frustrating from a customer perspective tho, especially for released figures. However, I've purchased from stores like CDJapan who do provide shipping estimates that you pay for when you order but they can end up asking you to pay more if the shipping ends up being higher than expected\n\n\n3. I've found that amiami shipping can be pricey but they aren't necessarily the priciest for me (eg CDJapan was pricier even for the same method for me before).",

If not, you have the option of leaving a message with your contact info and they\u2019ll email you back the next day with a response.\n\nAlternatively, If you have an account with mandarake and the figure is released, you can also look it up there for EMS/DHL estimates (it\u2019s precalculated on the page so you don\u2019t need to ask manually). From my experience the shipping quotes are very similar between the two sites.",

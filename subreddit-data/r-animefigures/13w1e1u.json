I'm still waiting on my Miku Symphony 5th anniversary figure to arrive, but I've been hearing that her hair is drooping?\n\nMFC link: https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1049502\n\nDoes anyone who has her have this problem? I'm wondering if I should find some supports for her hair.\n\nFor example: https://www.hpoi.net/album/207854\n\nMultiple comments on the Hpoi main figure page too: https://www.hpoi.net/move/hobby/61401",

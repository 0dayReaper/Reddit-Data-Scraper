The stockings are absolutely stunning, but the stock photographers did a great job of making that hand up by her face look less awkward. Here it just looks strange to me.\n\nEdit: oof, just realized that the way I worded this could be taken to mean I'm complaining about your photography skills. Rather, I mean that the way people usually take photographs is to show the way the figure looks in real life, not to conceal as many oddities as possible for maximum sales potential. \ud83d\ude42\n\nI do love that green/choco brown combo, though",

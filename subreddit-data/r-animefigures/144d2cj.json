    "postText": "To clarify my question a little more, I'm talking about figures that don't have a lot of feedback or pictures from owners/collectors.  There are a few figures that are relatively cheap on the market currently that have piqued my interest.  They're figures that seem to fit well with others that I own or just look good enough on their own that I feel like buying it.\n\nThe only problem is that it seems that nobody else owns one.  I like to see feedback and images from other owners to see if a figure is worth the pricetag attached to it.  I imagine everyone else here does as well.  It feels like a gamble when you're buying one that has virtually no coverage or information on it provided by the community.\n\nSo does anyone have experience with what seems to be taking the road less traveled when it comes to buying certain figures?",

May also find some pics on Taobao sometimes if customers left a photo in their review. For a Chinese figure, I may also try Weibo, sometimes you get lucky lol.",

I just don't want to resort to buying the figure and later having to sell it because it wasn't as good as I was expecting.  I just hate having to take an unnecessary net loss especially when you have nothing to show for it.",

Having a more unique collection, regardless of the figure\u2019s quality, can also be rewarding in and of itself.",

Check my collection on MFC, but all in all there is a low chance I would have exactly those you are looking for.",

That's a mainly english speaking community for figure collecting (only JP IPs and/or companies tho...)  and people can write reviews of their figures they've bought so u can do a bit more product research before you buy! A lot of figures don't have dedicated blog reviews but u can get a bit of an idea with the star rating and the figure page comments or throw some people who have the figure under owned some DMs. I've found the fact that they're inclined to share their collection online in the first place makes most of them a pleasure to geek out with in PMs \ud83d\ude02\n\nA lot of figures (unless they're really really limited/I think it'll sell out) I try to wait for the real thing bc differences from the prototype can be a real issue, though certain companies have worse reputation than others \ud83d\ude02. I'm always stalking MFC/HPOI (basically CHN ver MFC) pages for when someone uploads a pic or I'll see if someone doesn't mind me bothering them to ask how the figure quality is esp compared to the proto/product images in PMs \ud83d\ude02 and ofc u have people who post pics of their figs in this sub! Though keyword searching can be a bit more finicky than just searching owners of the figure ID on MFC but I'll look at multiple venues if need be. Some people unbox figs on YouTube as well you can check out.",

On the flip side, it could not be a good quality figure, so I'd do my best to find any uploaded pics. If you like it enough to give it a shot, at the very least your investment is low. \n\nI would consider the manufacturer and the age of it, as these things can play a big role in quality.",

They are more lenient now but in the past that included all Chinese IP and originals.\n\nPreordering a new manufacturer is quite the same, for known manufacturers mostly you know what to expect even without pics (though I've gotten burned by that assumption before). But sometimes it pays off, [one of my absolute favorites](https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=FIGURE-611426) was a relatively expensive gamble.",

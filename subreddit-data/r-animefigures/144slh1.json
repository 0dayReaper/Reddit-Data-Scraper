(and not asking for email/login/passwords)\n\nThey've sent me those once I place my order saying we have received your order and they've sent me your preorder has shipped under the same email.\n\nThey seem to be having issues lately sending it as your preorder has shipped but I already got it (plus tracking shows delivered already) - (confusing moment)",

    "postText": "It has never happened to me. The package was in the post office JUST today, I didnt even got a chance to contact them and I just saw the tracking number that has been updated TODAY. It has 3 notifications at the exact same time. It looks like they tried to deliver, didnt found anyone and \"left a message to recipient\" -thats a classic for that local delivery company, i just always go to the office the next day cause they are too freaking lazy to ACTUALLY contact me before the delivery- but then the 3rd notification says that the recipient  is UNKOWN and they are sending the package back to sender. That was in 11.30 AM. Now its 2.30 AM, more than 12 hours later at night. I dont check the tracking number every hour! Even if i have noticed the notifications one hour later, it appears that something must have been wrong with my info in order to deem the package \"unknown recipient\". \n\nHas anyone experienced this with global freaks? Could they even send the package if they haven\u2019t declared a receiver?! Could my info have been scratched or smudged while at transportation?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhat should i expect from global freaks? are they going to send it back again without making me pay the extra delivery? will they force me to pay again for delivery? can i ask for my money back and not just store credits? \n\nthe package has been paid for with paypal A YEAR ago, so i dont think i have the protection from them. Should i try contacting my bank? Ask for my local post office for proof that there were no info on the package?",

I\u2019ve seen this before for an incorrect address (person forgot to put the flat number in the address) so the courier didn\u2019t know where to deliver it\n\nCould be that or bad delivery driver. I\u2019d contact Global Freaks, the parcel will likely be returned to them but this sounds like an address or courier issue to me",

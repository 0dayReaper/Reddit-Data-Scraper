    "postText": "Hello,\n\nMaybe it was already posted on this subreddit but I wanted to ask.\n\nI pre-ordered a PUP figure in january on the global site (I'm in France) and today they charged me. My issue is that I received an email saying: credit card payment error. I did try to update my payment method as the email said but it didn't help and I received the same email right behind. I'm using a visa debit card and I didn't hava any issues on other websites.\n\nDo any of you have any advice ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: For further reference this is the response I got from customer service:\n\n Upon checking on my end, there are 2 possible reasons as to why payment is being declined.\n\n\u30fbYour card issuer is not providing us the details of your billing address which is causing the issue. Our Payment Gateway needs to perform mandatory security checks to deem that the transaction is not fraudulent. This includes ensuring that the Billing Address registered to your card matches with what you have registered on Goodsmile Online Shop.\n\nor\n\n\u30fbYour card issuer's payment network does not accept EUR payments for international transactions and it must be paid with the local currency, which for Japan is in JPY. \n\nIf this can help somebody else that would be good.",

Sometimes I'll  get the error message of payment not being recieved but  i just gotta punch it in again and it goes through just fine. Although maybe its because Im in the US.",

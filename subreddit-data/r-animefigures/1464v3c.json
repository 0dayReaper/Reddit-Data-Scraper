Your list prices are higher even before shipping than eBay, and eBay is already usually a bit high.   \n\nHyakkimaru:  \neBay $145 with shipping  \nYour price $150 plus shipping  \n\nIwanaga:  \neBay $105 with shipping  \nYour price $110 plus shipping  \n\nIf you\u2019re willing to lower prices to a more reasonable level, I\u2019d purchase some.",

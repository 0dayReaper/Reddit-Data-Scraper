            "comment": "With the release of Lartoria\u2019s figma I now finally have what I consider the main three types of figures (scale, action, and nendo) for my favorite FGO character! Never thought they would make all three but here we are. I like it.\n\nQuick impressions of the figma: It's definitely rough around the edges. Lots of paint scuffs and transfers around the locations you don\u2019t normally see like Dun Stallion\u2019s butt or Lartoria\u2019s back. The paint itself also seems to kinda smear sometimes if you rub it too much (I inadvertently smeared a little of the paint onto her chest since I was trying to get other paint off of it, which meant I had to rub it even more to get that off lol). Dun Stallion kinda can\u2019t do anything except stand there without a stand though; the leg joints aside from the ones that connect to his body are pretty loose, and even with the stand it's kinda a pain to work with him. Lartoria herself though is fine aside from the paint issues. Its my first time having a figma with a fabric cape, and its definitely a novel experience. The cape does have a tendency to not hold its shape if you try to bend the cape right up at the top, but starting a little further down isn\u2019t too much of an issue. Overall, shes looks good but doesn\u2019t exactly play good.",

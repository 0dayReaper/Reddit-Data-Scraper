            "comment": "It is definitely not melting (from heat). If the surface is tacky, with the little information provided here, likely the issue is plasticizer.\n\nWhen plastics are injection molded (like most figures), the manufacturer adds plasticizer to make the plastic more flexible so it is easier to form. To very simplify and generalize, the plasticizer slowly migrates to the surface and vaporized, however if it is in a sealed box, it can build up and prevent more from vaporizing. It mostly presents as a sticky, shiny surface on the figure.\n\nWhat we see here is iffy, as usually it presents on the entire surface and it typically doesn't leech pigments (what seems to be happening here, from the picture). It looks more like you got a plastic solvent on it, but that wouldn't be inside a box.",

I only have a couple resin figures, two of which are polystone, and none of which have ever had issues with plasticizer. To my limited understanding, you would use way less plasticizer in resin figures. It is also a newer figure, so it is more likely to use high molecular weight plasticizers, which migrate much slower. It does seem to be a China only company, so they might be using low-molecular-weight phthalates (most are banned in Japan). This is also a new manufacturer, so the pigment leeching could be something else I am unfamiliar with.",

This would speed up plasticizer drying or remove any problematic substance on the figure. I don't really see any downside either, though it doesn't really identify the issue.",

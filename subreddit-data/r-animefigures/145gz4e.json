They have points system - 5% of order amount (before shipping) as discount points for future orders.  \nBtw, initially they got me worried - they do not seem to respond to emails. But then I noticed live chat on account page. They respond very fast in chat, and the log of messages is stored in user account page. So if you have questions about your order just ignore contact email and go straight to the chat.",

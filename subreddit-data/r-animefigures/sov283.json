Can comfortably get Aqua, Homura, Rem and Ram 2 at the back and 2 in front with plenty of wiggle room. Albedo would definitely fit. \n\nMy 3rd billy has Morliden doors and yeah great visibility! Though her ankles/feet would likely pile past the centre divide. \n\nI'm tempted to order as I have Overlord on my list of to watch this year. And I'll probably regret it if I don't. But that price! And same month as Revy \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02\n\nI should not have started a bunny collection in 2021!",

You're supposed to pull those out and plug in the real, painted ears. I suppose you could cut those down to just fill the holes without sticking out any further.",

For Amiami, the shipping will likely go over 10,000 yen based on her pose and wings. Bunny shipping price already average around 9,000 yen for Amiami to the US currently, so with the size of Albedo, she will likely hit 12,000-15,000 yen in shipping.",

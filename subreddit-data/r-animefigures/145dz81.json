Have to agree with what i've seen mentioned in a few places, she looks even better in rl than in photos. They did a really a good job in making her feel like Rei should be\n\nOnly nitpick is, and again i'm not writing anything new, that her scale is kinda wack. She really does not feel like a 1/7 -as she is advertised- but at the same time she's not exactly as small as a 1/8\nBecause of that, out of the 2 Eva-group photos i took, i feel like she ends being more at home with the Megahouse Rei than with Radio Asuka.\n\nDoes it detract from the overall quality?Nah, not really, it is one of the best Rei i've seen so far, no doubt there\n  \nP.s: sorry for the repost, noticed one of the photos was badly out of focus^( not that the other are good,but.. ) and the thing kept bothering me XD",

    "postText": "I\u2019m not a serious collector (due to limited money and space), but have really wanted to get just a few figures for a while now. I decided to start by getting a set of Banpresto SQ K-On figures since the anime and manga hold a special place for me. (Still a decent sized investment, but way more affordable than other figures I\u2019ve dreamed of getting!)\n\nAnyway, I just got the Mio figure, and it looks nice, but I can\u2019t get the feet to stay on the base very well - it\u2019s very wobbly. Was wondering if someone here might have some advice for keeping it in place? I don\u2019t really want it to fall over all the time, but also don\u2019t any to do anything to wreck the figure (I initially thought about glue and then realized that would be a bad idea lol). Thanks!",

If it is just too loose in the hole maybe try [these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/tesa-59405-00000-00-Universal-Adhesive-Alternative/dp/B01N75L50W/ref=asc_df_B01N75L50W/?tag=googshopuk-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=205217354803&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=15605567940557906501&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=m&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1007109&amp;hvtargid=pla-422435555205&amp;psc=1&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1) . You can simply cut a small piece of it off and that should keep it from moving around too much. It\u2019s also easily removable",

    "postText": " Hi fellow collectors, I just started out figure collecting and got myself my first 3 figures, my gaming lounge area has a shelf with backlighting that is built into the ceiling and wall, so I can not move it or put a normal Detolf there (pictures). It looks pretty sick but I am worried about the dust situation, is it feasible to just put them there, my apartment does have air purifier but still dust settles, will this ruin my figures over time ?  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e1r1cs8u6p4b1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f9a7f80b8cb06300a43f405e8e28bd14f439ed72\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dlve5eim6p4b1.jpg?width=2268&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6a99260da95bd01b2823fc84910a47901ca11a00",

Unless you just never ever dust for a long time and let it build up esp in crevices it would probably be ok?\n\nI think your backdrop looks really cool. Like cooler than Detolfs. Detolfs like anything else that more enclosed do reduce dust but you'll still get dust unless you make modifications to make it airtight.",

I like that backdrop a ton and think a little dusting here and there is worth having it. :) I recommend this a ton here but I\u2019d get an electric duster if you need something to get the job done fast. Please remember to brace or hold your figures as you dust them. Don\u2019t want any sensitive parts to break or fly off either so be sure not to hit them with too strong of wind. If you duster only has a high setting be sure to hold it away from the figure as to not damage anything.",

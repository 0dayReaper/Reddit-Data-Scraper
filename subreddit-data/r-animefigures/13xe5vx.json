Sculpt, pose and paint looks nice (the hammer doesn't have the heart on it, but its facing away from the front anyway) and it feels high quality. I did say the sculpt is good, but it isn't anything crazy. But considering the price point of them, it's acceptable. Although it's surprisingly light. Not good or bad, just something I noticed. So I'd say she'd be a good one if you like her character",

Nobara is great, Sukuna had a few paint mark issues, but they were exclusively on his back area so I cant see them when displayed.\n\nThe figurarts zero line is a bit on the smaller side, but if you're ok with that then the price is pretty good\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b70ahuytti3b1.jpeg?width=3096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b445b5df12bec2fe46afe9744e89b3ebcbf9b83d\n\nHere's Sukuna",

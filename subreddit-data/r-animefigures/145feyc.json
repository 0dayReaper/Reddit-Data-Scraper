    "postText": "Hi all, my past couple orders with Crunchyroll have been handled pretty poorly and I\u2019m wondering if anyone has had similar experiences or if I am just unlucky. \n\nFirst incident: I placed an order for 5 *in stock* figures. Receiving shipping email that all items had shipped. The package arrived with only one figure and heavily damaged. \n\nTheir customer service system is pretty awful; there\u2019s an online contact form or a semi-hidden chat that will just have an agent submit a contact form for you. No customer service line, and my three inquiries went unanswered. After a couple weeks I finally tweeted at them and got some movement, and they said they would ship my other items immediately. \n\nSecond package arrived, still missing an item :( I got back in touch through Twitter, and after a few days they responded the figure was no longer available and gave me $10 coupon. \n\nSecond incident: Placed an order to take advantage of the coupon. Same situation, received an email that all items had shipped but no tracking number. Box showed up today, and it\u2019s just one item again. The order shows as entirely shipped on crunchyroll website. \n\nI know they ship from a couple different warehouses but is this normal? Both of these bungled up orders have been within the past month and I haven\u2019t had any issues with them in the past.",

I had issues with them messing up my address on my packages, which couldn\u2019t be delivered, and a lot of delays on figs. Figures I ordered kept being pushed back months and months for release because of &gt;!covid!&lt; ,which I understand. \n\nShipping was an awful experience. I had some MP100 keychains that I ordered from them and I put my address correctly but FedEx wasn\u2019t delivering it to my home. It was a back &amp; forth communication/complaints with crunchyroll and FedEx trying to figure out what went wrong in the process. In the end, Crunchyroll did put my address in wrong and it was fixed after so many painstakingly emails. \n\nSure, I was able to buy figures I really wanted from the store but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m every shopping with them again. It\u2019s overpriced and the shipping process is terrible.",

I contacted support last week amd they told me that they sold me a figure that was no longer in stock. They never once contacted me in those 4 months to let me know that she was actually out of stock... They took my money and just hoped that I would never contact them for a refund. Honestly imo crunchyroll is a scam I would never order from them again.",

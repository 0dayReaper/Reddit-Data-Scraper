She has several great poses in the manga, and her other WIP figures, most of which will be far cheaper than this one, have significantly better poses that are more representative of her character. This is a generic, uninspired pose that could be on any other character. Maybe I shouldn't expect a Freeing bunny to be anything other than bland, but compared to how phenomenal Power looks, it is disappointing.",

Power at the very least feels expressive and dynamic to a certain degree, but the way her arm and leg are out feels oddly stiff. I also feel like Makima could\u2019ve had a much more dominating pose of sorts than something as basic as just arms crossed in front of her. The faces look strange up close, especially with the almost hyper realistic noses. I get its what they were going for since thats pretty close to Fujimoto\u2019s art style, but I think it looks a bit awkward in a larger three dimensional scale.",

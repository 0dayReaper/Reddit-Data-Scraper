            "comment": "I have a figure with a hole on the bottom of the feet instead of pegs with the pegs instead being on the base. With most other figures the problem is that their holes or pegs are too big to fit but for me the opposite seems to be true. Everytime I push the foot onto the peg the foot just seems to pop back up a little which ends up making the figure always stand leaning due to it not being secured onto the base.\n\nSo I was wondering how I could fix this issue, the figures\u2019 holes on the feet seem to big to fit the pegs even though it\u2019s the base it came with and was designed for. I\u2019d appreciate the help!",

The advantage is that it's reversible without any damage.\n\n\nYou can also paint the pegs with clear sealant or glue (not to glue it, just to make it tighter) to make it tighter, or use air drying clay like miliput or green stuff (you can cut or sand that to size).",

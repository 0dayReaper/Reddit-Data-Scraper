            "comment": "We are going back to 2014. This fig is one that I always wanted when I wasn't collecting at all. I also wanted a Tony fig especially from the T2 Art Girls. Tony is one of the most well-known illustrators still illustrating till this day! The amount of figs on his \"by illustrator\" on MFC is nearly 300! Sugie Sun is just freaking AF and the cast-off is just a bonus lol. I want to see more figs with the concept of the leaf clothing theme. She is one of Tony's best work out of the many he illustrates. There are other beautiful ones that I also have my eyes on.\n\nI wanted to find Sugie Sun somewhere that isn't selling her for a ridiculous price. So I decided \" you know what I'm going to check out Amiami pre-owned section. I found her in A/B condition for 13,980 or around $99.89 USD. Literally around her original price back in 2014. Of course..... shipping price after lol. She is literally brand new, no discoloration, funky smell or anything damaging in nature even after 9 years of not being opened. Only a minor spot on her right leg but it's not too noticeable. One of my biggest gripes, I wish for the companies that makes cast-offs could do better with fig panties that are a lot easier to put on. I have another fig that has a similar issue so I just leave them loose \n\nI was worried about Amiami pre-owned grading because I'm used to Akiba Soul pre-owned \"S/A sealed in an unopened box\". Amiami pre-owned Fig rating A: Item is sealed and is unopened or \"appears to be unopened\" was the worry. I played the game and still came out victorious, but you know every fig is different. Although I am more open to trust AmiAmi pre-owned section a lot more now.",

Plus I have the choice for DHL. Had bad experiences with EMS. The DHL guy was nice but he put the box below my legs instead of handing it over to me. Like uhhhhh okay wtf? Lol",

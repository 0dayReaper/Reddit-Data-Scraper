I can see clearly emilias base, her arm broken off to side/fell off, and then rem is standing up to the right side, not able to tell if shes broken but they probably are. Rem looks like she is possibly in better state. This is heart breaking. I just got my emilia and if that happened to me, I'd cry for weeks. I already lost the Rem due to shipping and that sucks, but Emilia is my second favorite character next to Chitoge from nisekoi",

I have some Megahouse Naruto Gals figures, so I feel like they'll still topple over. Using putty is probably better than nothing though, and I don't think that it'd damage the base.\n\nIf I got a display shelf (I currently don't have one), I want to look up how to lock the door if that's possible. I wonder if it's possible to get those lock-able display cases that they have in stores like Wal-Mart.",

I recommend really taking your time and double or triple checking that everything lines up before drilling any holes. Use tape to hold the lock plate while you align it, it really helps.\n\nGood luck!",

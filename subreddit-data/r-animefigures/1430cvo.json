    "postText": "So AmiAmi recently refunded me for an order I had paid months ago because they said an item on that order was out of stock. How does this even happen when the invoice said the item was in stock? I lost a little over $300 USD cause of this dumb shit. They usually email me about this but they didn't say anything this time. I would've told them to give me AmiAmi points instead so that I don't lose money. I tried emailing them, however they said that this was an automated process but then I don't understand why they didn't do this sooner. Is there anything I could do?",

When I payed the order the yen was stronger than what it is now, but now the yen is weaker so the refund amount was lower. I talked to them but they don't want to retract the refund. I am probably going to cancel items from the order \ud83d\ude43.",

I'm not sure if a refund can even be reversed.\n\nThe only thing I can recommend is get an International card that you can top up. This way, you can spend Yen and be refunded in Yen if this happens in the future. Sorry you lost a lot in this order. That's at least 1-2 figures or shipping cost.",

Most companies would just do a partial refund.\n\nI have no idea why AA does this - it's not like they're incapable of partial refunds - they have done it occasionally, but no, this is the way they roll.",

Iirc it's their helpdesk that isn't set up correctly so the mail spam checks fail. I had to edit one of my mail filters to stop AA mails occasionally finding their way into spam &gt;&lt;\n\nUnfortunately this can happen rarely with any retailer - stock gets miscounted, they've damaged out some units leaving them short, someone sends out a replacement to another customer and forgets to go through the process to update stock count. \n\nWhy AmiAmi doesn't issue partial refunds in this scenario I don't know - they're the only retailer I know that insists on reinvoicing the whole order when something goes wrong. It's stupid and they should really update their backoffice systems to actually do this - it would be so much more convenient on both sides - they'll be able to get the order out of the door quicker and they won't have the issue of customs then refusing, forgetting or not noticing they have an invoice to pay. \n\nAA really is a stubborn old goat.",

Also, proportionate to their use, their plastic pollution levels are impressively low. However, that is because the majority of it is burned (though they call it 'thermally recycled').\n\nBut yeah, the US is atrocious for both use and pollution, and the UK isn't far behind. And China and India are notorious for how much they produce (though they have a lot of people) and especially how they handle it.\n\nI am not especially concerned about Japan's impact, specifically.",

I have her pre-ordered on amiami in a group order with a a SAS Mista (grape flavor ver). \nNever been more thankful for delays moving a scale I had in the same order out to October.

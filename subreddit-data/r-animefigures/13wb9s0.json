I hand painted it instead of airbrushing it so it's a little messy but I still think it's cute. \n\nDaki: This was a figure I took off another figure and redesigned it and repainted the hair.\n\nSailor Moon: This was a blank garage kit I fully painted (with an airbrush) and assembled. \n\nMileena: This was a Pop figure I made and painted.",

But I noticed sometimes companies don't make figures of characters I like or they don't make them look how I'd like them to look. So I thought I'd try to modify them to look like how I want. I started just using simple things like acrylic paint, small paint brushes, and a good glue. Now I also sometimes use other things like an airbrush and a power drill. It's lots of ideas and trial and error really :)",

Depending on how strong the color is I'm painting over, I either paint over it with a couple of coats straight on top or I paint a coat of white acrylic paint over it first. I've never stripped figures because I've been fine so far just painting over them. I don't watch tutorials, I just try to figure stuff out and hope for the best XD",

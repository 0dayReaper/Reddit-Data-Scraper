    "postText": "Ordered all these gals from different stores. \nYunYun and Kurumi are on their way, currently and the rest are on preorder. I havent seen any posts really about Black Bunny Aoi. Very excited for them to all though. I just recently saw some pictures of Bunny Mai and shes absolutely beautiful - so glad I snagged her. \nYor and Anya look so adorbs. Wish they had Loyd to go with them.. Ilulus preorder is about to close so I had to get her since Tohru came and went so quickly but I was lucky enough to snag Tohru. Tohru disappeared from shop as soon as I ordered her, too! Would love to have a complete set of Dragon Maid but sucks they dont make much of Kobayashi... \n\nAll were purchased on\nKappy Hobby\nGood Smile\nLunar Toy Store \nCrunchyRoll\nTokyo Otaku Mode\n\nAnyone else able to snag any if these ladies?",

Maybe pick up later.\n\nOtherwise ILULU, I grabbed a PO long ago. Looking forward to the Ribose one also and her nendo.",

I really love this figure specifically and it does suck they dont have a whole lot of options for Loid. \n\nI so cannot wait until Ilulu comes in. She fr is a cute figure and the fact there isnt many made of her. I saw that Ribose one!!! I need to know when it will be released! Everything about that figure is amazing. Cant wait to see the painted release pictures.",

I dont like how she gets to much hate as I have some short, big chested friends and some act similar to her.. shes cute all around and love her feisty personality. Her design is always flawless(besides her Nendoroid being a bit off). Hopefully Ribose will continue to make more designs of her. They have stunning figures with great details for a really great price.",

I grew up watching these animes and love them and how they basically aged up with the people growing up watching (instead of like Pokemon where they're children FOREVER lol) it feels like the characters progress and grow as a person from who they were when they started. \n\nI will keep a look out for more figures being released because it would be nice.

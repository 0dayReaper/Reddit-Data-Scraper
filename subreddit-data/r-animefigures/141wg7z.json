I would get a detolf shelf personally eventually but there's literally no room in my bedroom, so my bookshelf and some leftover space on the top of my desk will have to do. xD\n\nI'm happy there are no noticeable defects (if any at all)! \\^-\\^ Thankfully my first two figures don't have any either. I have only started collecting so hopefully this trend continues, for the both of us!",

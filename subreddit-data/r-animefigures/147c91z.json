This is literally my holy grail, I\u2019m in love with this figure! \n\nI was wondering if there\u2019s any website I can preorder it where I get to pay now. This is my first time preordering a figure, and I\u2019m not sure exactly what to do lol. I know he\u2019s available on AmiAmi, but is there a way to pay in advance instead of when he releases?",

I don't really get prize figures considering the quality but dang the quality is really nice with her!! I'm usually soo oicky about faves but it really captured her!\n\nRacing Miku 2014 ver!\nI love this Miku especially having the engines at her side idk there's something really cool about it!\nWaiting till i get back home to open her though since putting up nendos is a bit of a pain lol\n\nTold myself I'm only buying 1 Racing Miku and 1 Snow Miku otherwise I'll fall into the endless void that is Miku figures \ud83d\ude02 I'm already giving a pass for 2 Miku scales (depending on how the coloring comes out/price for Miku 15th Anniversary Star) But I'll probably give myself more and more exceptions \ud83d\ude05 I put my foot in the door for Miku figures and she got me \ud83d\ude06",

For me (tho i am a noob collector) if anything the bunny/suit material are quite obvious very plasticky looking but not like I have anything to compare it with so maybe shiny suits are how they all look, and I learned I prefer matte but she's still beautiful regardless!!",

No rush at all though, thank you for the reply! \n\nThe reason I'm asking was because I got a Mai figure recently but was slightly disappointed when the stockings weren't connected as neatly as I hoped.

Also being cute and sexy helps!!",

But anyway she looks really cute and I can see why you knew you had to have her! X3",

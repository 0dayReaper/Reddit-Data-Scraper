    "postText": "One of my all time grail arrived!!  Battle Angel Alita / Gunnm. The portrait is masterclass and the pose is dynamic. This statue definitely benefit from being on a turntable since each viewing angle offers something different. \n\nI\u2019m actually surprised it arrive in perfect condition since the hair is so fragile, cowlick and bangs could be broken easily so had to be super careful taking it out.  Really wish P1 offered some busts to hold the extra portraits like Figurama in this case. \n\nThe fabric cape is poseable as it has wires in it but it feels like the head doesn\u2019t sit all the way in when I have it on so I\u2019ll leave it off fearing that the head might fall and break. \n\nAll in all just a fantastic statue and can\u2019t wait for Rusty Angel and Repair Angel. Skipping the motor ball Gally though cause I didn\u2019t like the arc.",

If the sun pooled together money, gave it to you, and said okay you pick based on what we think it\u2019s fine. \n\nBut if you like it, then that\u2019s what matters the most, bootleg or not. For myself, I think it\u2019s worth buying the original but if it\u2019s not realistic, then it isn\u2019t. As long as you enjoy yourself, it\u2019s your hobby and collection. If you think it\u2019s worth it, and you think it\u2019d great, go for it!",

I feel like it\u2019s a steal kinda because I can just fix her and make a custom base for her.

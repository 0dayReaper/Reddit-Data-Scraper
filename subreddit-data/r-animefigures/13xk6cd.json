Prices in USD, but shipping from Canada! More pics available if requested! \n\nRevolve Asuka 1/7 - $120\n\nKotobukiya Yui and Yukino 1/8 + Wonderful Works Yui Yuigahama 1/7 Rocker Version - $200 (selling as a bundle preferably) \n\nPlease note: While they have been regularly dusted, they are from a home with a dog, so I cannot guarantee there is not dog hair within the box!",

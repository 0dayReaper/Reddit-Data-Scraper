I mean, why keep them if you aren\u2019t gonna use them. I used to horde them just in case but I never really ended up using all of them. \n\nIf you want to keep them, you can grab the biggest box of the pile and use it as a storage bin to hold the smaller boxes. That way in case something does come up, you can use them for whatever you are needing them for.",

I put two of the larger ones on the sofa to keep my dog off (he sheds like crazy, tried plastic cat spikes, but my dog learned to remove them, he has a harder time moving the boxes).\n\nExcess boxes get flattened and thrown in the recycling bin.\n\nIf the boxes are of decent size/quality, the local community Facebook group often has people looking for packing boxes.",

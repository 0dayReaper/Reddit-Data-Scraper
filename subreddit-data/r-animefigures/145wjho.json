While I absolutely love the design, I see that the original price was around 9700 Yen while the resale price now is 22,000 yen(cheapest). \n\nIs the price of resale figures usually this high or this is a one off thing because of the character's popularity?",

            "comment": "As with any collectable with a limited number produced, it varies based on consumer popularity entirely, and with figures over the last few years, things which are popular and no longer for sale can easily be double the original price (or more) so this isn't unheard of. I just saw a figure that was released 3-4 years ago for 16,000 for 45,000 on Mandarake, so yeah, it sucks if you missed out on the original release sometimes!",

That same figure got a more recent release this year at 18000 JPY, so I would treat that as the new MSRP (accounting for inflation, weaker yen etc). And that rerelease was a limited pbandai JP exclusive, so it wouldn\u2019t have been widely available. 22000 seems like a fair aftermarket price (to me) based on those factors, but you should do your own research of course.\n\nYou should pay a price that 1) you\u2019re comfortable with financially and 2) reflects the worth of this figure to you personally. I would put less emphasis on getting a \u201cgood deal.\u201d Ultimately plastic is plastic and aesthetic is subjective.",

While I love the character and the design is really good, I have seen figures around this range offering a lot more(please correct me if I am wrong, this is just 1 month of hardcore amiami browsing). \n\nCurrently I have two options, 1) Buy this and not browse figures for a while to protect wallet-kun 2) Be patient and wait for newer One Piece figures. I do figure number 2 would be the best thing to do from a neutral standpoint, but I can't control myself these days. I find myself constantly browsing One Piece figurines, trying to find the \"one\".",

If you frequently get buyer\u2019s remorse for not getting the absolute best bang for your buck, you will quickly discover that collecting becomes less enjoyable (at least IMHO).\n\nHowever, since you mentioned that you\u2019re new: I think it\u2019s correct to be a bit more discerning with your purchases. When you start out, everything is new and shiny and you may make impulse purchases you regret later (less so because of finances and more so because you realize you didn\u2019t like something as much as you initially liked and were just hyped to start a collection). You might also not consider factors such as display space, and how a certain figure might or might not fit in with the rest of your future collection.",

You might feel less inclined to impulse buy if you force yourself to log purchases and see what else you\u2019ve bought that month or year.\n\nThe biggest thing though is to simply step away from things that you know will tempt you. If you make a habit of browsing amiami everyday, you\u2019re bound to make purchases you wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. Consider setting alerts for certain figures you know you want rather than being an opportunist.",

            "comment": "Maybe I'm still waking up, but didn't I see on the MFC page that there was a re-release like literally last month? He should still be available for retail. (Which, I know the 2023 retail price is more expensive, but so is everything else.)\n\nEdit: Okay I have a brain now and 22k is a fine price for that? His retail price on this release is 18k, so less than a $40 USD increase there. You could also tool around on second hand sites or domestic retailers and see if anyone has him. (TOM might be a good option depending on what their welcome discount is nowadays, but you'd have to look into it.)\n\nTry not to think about \"original retail\" price. Especially for something released in 2017, those numbers hardly mean anything. By today's conversion rate, he would've sold for under $70, which is even cheaper than scales were when I started collecting in 2014.\n\nI think if this is a long-time favorite character of yours and kind of your dream figure, you should spend the money one way or another. Early in my collecting journey I put more money than I was used to towards an aftermarket scale of one of my favorite characters and guess what--it's still one of my favorite figures. (It was [this one](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/6435). I spent $160, which was a lot at the time! New releases were like $100 and under, and I'd gotten other second-hand figures for even less than that. But I was really happy at the time, and I'm still glad that was the first figure I worked hard to both find and afford.)\n\nAnyway, sorry for the essay but hopefully some of that helps.",

I also noticed that this time around was a MegaHouse exclusive, so it was harder to get (and part of why it's more expensive). Again, I'd check out TOM's welcome discount if you're US-based--if it's a large figure (AmiAmi warns that it is), then the free shipping over $150 could be useful.",

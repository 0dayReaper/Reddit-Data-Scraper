    "postText": "I just recently bought [this figure](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1064642) off of someone on this subreddit and would like to keep it in some type of single figure display case. The figure, however, is pretty large (especially because of the lance). I\u2019ve seen others on this subreddit use [this case](https://www.hobbylobby.com/Home-Decor-Frames/Frames-Photo-Albums/Shadow-Boxes-Display-Cases/Helmet-Mirrored-Display-Case/p/80893004) back when it was at a $30 sale but now it\u2019s at $150.\n\nAre there any suggestions for affordable single unit cases that could fit this figure? \n\nThanks for any input!",

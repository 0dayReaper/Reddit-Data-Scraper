(It's even cheaper if you have some skills to make eveything yourself)\n\nI recomand these : [https://amzn.eu/d/3U40awK](https://amzn.eu/d/3U40awK) And i used led reflectors to put them in.\n\nYou can cut them every 5cm (or 10cm i'm not sure anymore, read notice). One electric input can feed to 2 lines ( so two sheves of a detolf in my customs set up) you can chose light intensity and If you have several of them, you can even use a single remote control for all of them.\n\nI had to do some easy welding to make what i wanted but this is what i did with only two sets of leds, aluminium profiles reflectors, 6 custom detolf and 2 ikea risers. It take some \"courage\" and a lot of planing to cut the detolfs but it's worth it imho, you gain a lot of space as 6 detolfs fit in the space of 5 normal detolf and you are not limited by the 40 cm L :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/orn9z3cfqo4b1.png?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=94b349944a55e54708f30974e0b075e9338a30a6\n\nI hope it helps you or anyone who think changing  lighting  or gain space.",

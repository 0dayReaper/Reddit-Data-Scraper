I'm mainly a bit disappointed that it looks like the delays on Suzu weren't so they could figure out a way to make the pair squish together like the illustration (but who knows, maybe that's still a possibility, just with Kaede only?). \n\nWith how far apart their releases are though, it's kind of obvious that they hadn't originally planned for the pair initially (same as they didn't plan for a matching Suzu for the earlier Kaede), and only decided on the matching Kaede around about the time Suzu was going up for preorder which is really odd since it seems pretty obvious that a lot of collectors would want both and want them to match.",

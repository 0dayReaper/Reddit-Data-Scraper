I live in the US and I mostly order PUPs and prize figures (usually older ones from the preowned section). \n\nMy last shipment that was just a PUP alone (it was toge inumaki) was 5,900JPY total (3300 jpy figure + 2600 JPY shipping). And I think that was DHL. DHL price is based on box size and SAL is usually always the cheapest but not available after a certain size and will take longer bc big boat is slow. DHL delivers in under 2 weeks as long as there are no holidays. I've actually received packages within like 4 days before. And you get a cute postcard. \n\nIf you ever see something you want that's labeled as in stock you can actually ask them what the estimated shipping would be.",

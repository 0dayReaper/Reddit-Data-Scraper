I'm doubly impressed that you have them all uncensored and in their full glory.\n\nAll of my lewd figures have their \"removable / optional\" clothing still attached, for various reasons. \n\nThis whole work from home craze is nerve wracking, as a collector. I have to turn on the \"blurred background/changed background\" feature when on video calls, lest I surprise my coworkers with all the detolfs in the background. I'd be sweating like crazy if I had your collection. Very nice.",

Amiami isn't too bad for me in terms of shipping rn, but I've mostly been ordering light/small prize figures as opposed to scales which I'm trying to get from domestic secondhand sellers on eBay for the most part. That's where I got my Skytube Ran Kohinata (and yes, she is without a doubt legit).",

There are soo many pretty figures released every month, you cannot possibly get (or pay for) everything, you need to set priorities. Obviously, I'm limiting myself to lewd figures only (very few exceptions), which naturally results in lots and lots of original characters not related to any regular anime franchises.\n\n&gt; I still might try to get the China dress Nekopara figures (I just wish  you could get both the lamps and the toy in the DX version) \n\n100% agreed! Makes no sense to release a \"DX\" version and not have it include all the stuff from the standard version as well. I'm not gonna buy them twice, damnit!",

So to make sure I understand, the clothes pieces are made from the same material as the body (so they're not just cloth) but can be removed and then put back whenever you want? Are all of the clothes always removable (for example for White Odette can you remove the hair accessory too) or do some of them limit what can be removed?",

Same as the figure itself, the clothes are usually made of plastic as well, often a little more flexible and with pins or other mechanisms to hold them in place. In many cases it's not just clothes, but whole body parts instead. E.g. the figure comes with two chest pieces, one fully nude and one covered up with a bra or something. Or the lower body comes in two variants, one of which allows insertion of objects (like the figures in the bottom left and right of the image).\n\n&gt;Are all of the clothes always removable (for example for White Odette  can you remove the hair accessory too) or do some of them limit what can  be removed? \n\nThat depends heavily on the figure. Only few figures can be stripped off everything, most will retain some partial clothing like seen on the image (most of the figures in that wear as little as possible). They are still statues, not action figures or dolls, so the amount of customizability is limited (and removable clothes of one figure do not fit any other figure). E.g. you cannot remove the hair accessory from White Odette, unless you want to permanently break it off and potentially damage the figure.\n\nAlso differs by company/brand. E.g. figures from Skytube or Native usually expose both the chest as well as the genitals. Others may only show a bare chest, but no detailed genitals (but probably some skimpy panties instead).",

I have seen \"soft body\", \"soft bust\", \"soft chest\" or \"soft breasts\" being used. Myfigurecollection has a few figures listed under the tag \"[soft breasts](https://myfigurecollection.net/browse.v4.php?tags%5B%5D=soft_breasts)\", but not all such figures might have been tagged correctly and might not be listed as such.\n\nNot sure how many there are, at least with regards to legit, official figures. I know that there are at least some illegal bootleg variants that add soft, squeezable breasts to the figure design (probably to stand out from the otherwise superior original). Maybe you saw these, because as most bootlegs, these will be rather cheap (both in price and quality).\n\nI don't own any myself, though.",

Follow by a couple of gentle swipes with a microfibre cloth. Then I use a makeup brush to dust off the rest and harder to reach areas. As others mentioned, Tamiya makes an anti static brush for dusting models that I've heard good things about, but I'm too cheap to buy it.\n\nForgot to say Q-tips work too! Nice Jeanne figure btw.",

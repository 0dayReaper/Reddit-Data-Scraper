            "comment": "We get this a lot on this subreddit. Sexually explicit material is legal in the United States, with the exception of material clearly involving minors under the age of 18. Sexually explicit material can be brought through US customs, as it is legal in the country. You may need to declare it, but it is a legal personal item.\n\nIf a customs officer opens and inspects a hentai figure, it may be awkward, but it is not illegal. You are not breaking the law by buying a porno, and bringing a pornographic collectable is no different. People get these shipped to them all the time with not issue, and customs law is the same no matter if you are accompanying your purchase or having it shipped.",

I figured since figures are classified as toys, importing them is customs tax free, unlike other goods, so I didn\u2019t claim anything.",

Even if there are explicit pictures on the outside of the box, it still isn't illegal. Now I'll say that if the figure is very obviously meant to be child looking, that might raise some eyebrows, but still shouldn't be an issue. \n\nAdding to this: I am no legal expert. Just going off the knowledge I do have. You could probably look up TSA rules or something regarding that specifically, but if you can import NSFW figures by ordering online, I don't really see how you wouldn't be able to bring them into the country physically.",

They both made it through no problem and I've never had any trouble with them. One had a picture of the figure on the box for customs as well, which is different from most orders I get.",

And they usually only check them if it's got electronics like phones or laptops in them.  my luggage always gets opened when i throw my laptops in there, but never get checked when its only clothes and souvineers.",

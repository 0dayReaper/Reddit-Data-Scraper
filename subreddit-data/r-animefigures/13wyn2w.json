Not sure if it\u2019s just how the picture was taken but the top gap of the detolf is much bigger than gap at the bottom. It also appears that the left shelf is sitting a bit lower than the right one looking at the floor trim behind them. Can be just photo distortion and just be the shelves are made a bit different from one another.",

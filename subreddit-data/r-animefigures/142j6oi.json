Some Nendoroids are fantastic no matter how you pose them, and it just becomes hard to pick one pose to put on display.  \n  \nIn my case I'm seriously considering buying all of the Made in Abyss Nendoroids a few more times just so I can have all the different face plates and poses on display at once. I love these things too much.",

My order from the first store disappeared from my account, so I assumed it had been cancelled, probably due to insufficient stock delivery, so I ordered again from another store and a few days later got billed by the first. They wouldn't let me cancel, so I paid for and received both figures. One I either gave or sold cheaply to a friend, the other I still have.\n\nIf someone is into modding, though, I can see wanting to keep an original alongside their custom. \n\nI detest all resellers. That is, those who buy multiples with the exclusive intention of selling at a markup for their own profit. Disgusting practice.",

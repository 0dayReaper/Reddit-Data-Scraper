Science wise, if your case is getting to 80C ambient for materials like PVC to begin softening, components like your fans would've warped and then fail, cpu gpu would've activated their emergency shutoff since the die surface wouldve exceeded their safe operating temp, etc. I have a PC that uses a 3d printed plastic case &lt;2mm from the heatsink and that plastic I used (pla) softens at 60c which is like the inside of a car in the summer with windows closed",

The worst thing is plasticizer leaking which is mistakened for melting but those would've leaked anyways and the same for figures that lean which is more of a manufacturing defect. If anything there's significantly more evidence of people leaving figures in their PC / hot garages for extended periods of time with no signs of damage",

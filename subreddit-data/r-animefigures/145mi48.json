    "postText": "Hello, I am looking to sell some of my figures to make some space as I am moving very soon. Keeping them, and their boxes is taking up a lot of room that I cannot afford at the time. All of the figures have not been open and were stored in a non-smoking and no pet home. Please let me know if you have any questions or want to negotiate a better price. Current prices do not include shipping but this can be discussed! I am honestly prioritizing speed of letting these go so I can be flexible on price. \n\nTimestamp: [https://imgur.com/a/ufe4PZg](https://imgur.com/a/ufe4PZg)\n\nScales:\n\nKFR illustration Nurse - 150\n\nGanbare Douki-chan (smile version) - 140\n\nPrincess Rose - 200\n\nNendoroid:\n\nRin Shima DX - 65\n\nRuka Sarashima - 40\n\nThanks for looking at my post!",

    "postText": "Some companies justify the price point the sheer weight of the figurine, it's just massive. Don't get me wrong it's great but let's be real here the shipping cost might be way more expensive than the figurine itself. (I wouldn't state spacing since surely you'd have the space if your buying something that big) Which would leave me with details left. Would you guys prefer a detailed figurine compared to a big figurine as for me personally I think it would make more sense as it wouldn't really give you that hearth attack of a shipping fee. But then why do some figurine have varying degree's of detail some cheaper ones have way more detail than expensive ones? Also any examples of your favorite detailed figurine or perhaps a balance between both big and detailed?",

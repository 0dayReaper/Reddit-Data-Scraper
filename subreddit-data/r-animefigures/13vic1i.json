Elemental magic users with familiars. But, two other \"evolved\" forms of the cards came out as well. One of them, which came out later (I think 2022), was the \"Channeler\" form, a stronger version where they have mastered their elements and familiars. \n\nThe other however, was the \"Familiar-possessed\". The Charmers lost controll of their power, and the familiars turned hostile and took over the charmer's body and mind. The card art shows their eyes to be a flat color, like in anime when someone gets like, mentally jacked up. Legitimately made me sad as a kid when I got the second Aussa card, cos she had been possessed and it made me feel bad haha.",

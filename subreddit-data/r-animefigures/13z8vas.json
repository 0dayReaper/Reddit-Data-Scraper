I've thought about displaying the cards behind the figures itself but I also want to make a sort of diorama for my figures since my display shelf space is small enough to make it room-like.",

Or you could get a corkboard or some putty to stick on walls and make a collage. I have [something similar](https://imgur.com/a/9Rv8irQ) using printed images from anime shows and some pins I got as gifts from the shops. Looks neat and I am sure the postcards would look even better. I honestly thought about doing that with the cards if I ever get enough of them.",

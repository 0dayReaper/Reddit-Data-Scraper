As the crotch  area has no where to slide out.. I would say youd have to cut it off yourself to get it completely off. There is also a TERRIBLE seam line on the right leg so displaying without it could look weird. Her neck is also a little too long imo but she looks good overall.\n\nShe has underwear on underneath so nothing special there :(\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ZlCEuCq\n\nEDIT: Here is some of her fully unclothed. Not mine but I do believe that right leg comes out to remove the suit. Haven't tried it myself. https://twitter.com/septieme__ci/status/1626643359803781121\n\nFinal edit: Confirmed her leg does come out very easily too this is how you remove the suit: https://imgur.com/a/77ZVgCQ them thicc thighs",

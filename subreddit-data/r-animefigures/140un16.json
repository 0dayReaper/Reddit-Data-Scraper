    "postText": "I'm selling a few of my figures. Please check the details and verification photos that can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UqXedDc9K_dTjqlCQ6iYRXLCSqhayJ7cyxptm5X2b4Q/) before PMing.\n\n\\* I would prefer to only sell to the USA because I use USPS fixed rate boxes, so the cost of shipping overseas is quite high. If you are outside of the USA, feel free to PM me for a shipping quote but please be aware it will be very expensive.\n\n\\* Since I use USPS fixed rate boxes, USA shipping is between $17 to $22 depending on the size. If you buy more than one figure I may be able to bundle them to reduce shipping costs depending on the size of the figures.\n\n\\*I only accept payments via Paypal.\n\n\\*I dusted the figures before taking photos, but I realized that some of them are still pretty dusty so I will be cleaning them again before shipping them out.\n\n\\*All figures have been opened.\n\n\\*Most items will likely be shipped out this upcoming Saturday (6/10). I am shipping from Pennsylvania.\n\n\\*Feel free to make offers!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|ITEM|SERIES|MFC|PRICE|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| Hisakawa Hayate 1/7 (Licorne) |The Idolmaster|[https://myfigurecollection.net/item/872361](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/872361)|$80|\n| Hisakawa Nagi 1/7 (Licorne) |The Idolmaster|[https://myfigurecollection.net/item/872360](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/872360)|$80|\n| Ichinose Shiki - Espresto - Bandai Spirits|The Idolmaster|[https://myfigurecollection.net/item/945050](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/945050)|$10|\n| Shimamura Uzuki 1/8 New Generation Ver |The Idolmaster|[https://myfigurecollection.net/item/166431](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/166431)|$50|\n| Minato Aqua 1/7 (Kotobukiya) |Hololive|[https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1034216](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1034216)|$90|\n| Hatsune Miku SPM Figure - Natural |Vocaloid|[https://myfigurecollection.net/item/287770](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/287770)|$15|\n| Hatsune Miku SPM Figure - Pieretta |Vocaloid|[https://myfigurecollection.net/item/619122](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/619122)|$10|\n| Senjougahara Hitagi 1/8 Kotobukiya |Monogatari series|[https://myfigurecollection.net/item/197619](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/197619)|$70|\n| Senjougahara Hitagi Madogatari Exhibition |Monogatari series|[https://myfigurecollection.net/item/440557](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/440557)|$15|\n| Kaname Madoka Madogatari Exhibition |Madoka Magica|[https://myfigurecollection.net/item/440565](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/440565)|$10|\n| Matsuoka Rin ALTAiR 1/8 |Free!

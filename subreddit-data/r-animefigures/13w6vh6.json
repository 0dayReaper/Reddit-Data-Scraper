    "postText": "I had bought the Asuka Radio Eva Part 2 figure from Amiami and it had some defects, I was able to exchange it at Amiami and they sent me another one. I just got it today and the figure is fine but now the base is scratched up. Would amiami send me the base only, or does anyone have any experience getting replacement parts fron Amiami?",

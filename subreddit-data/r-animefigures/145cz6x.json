Assuming you can't get them straight from GSC anymore (sold out), Amiami and Mandarake pre-owned will state when the listing includes bonus parts. (If it's not listed on the pre-owned page, it won't; don't make that newbie mistake.) Occasionally, someone on MFC will sell their bonuses, either together with the figure or separately.",

Usually Nendoroids come with two faceplate and a few accessory parts. With Master Chief, he just comes with default head and extra parts.\n\nYou can't just order the optional parts from them. Chibi Chop Shop basically buys the Nendoroid and then puts each part up for sale piecemeal so you don't have to buy a whole Nendoroid to replace a broken or lost part.\n\nHere's an [example](https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/1317821&amp;context%5B%5D=itemId%3A287743) of what I mean.",

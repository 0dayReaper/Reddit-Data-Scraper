            "comment": "Technically, AmiAmi does not have a concept of monthly order, they merely offer to combine preorders expected to be released in the same month.  \nThe only way to delay payment request for in-stock figures is to combine them with existing preorders for the current month.  \nPayment request is made soon after all preorders either arrived in stock or moved to a new order because its release date changed. This is not necessarily at the end of the month, it all depends on release dates.  \nFor me few times AmiAmi missed that some figure got delayed, and only after I asked them ~1 week later to move it to a separate order they did that and send a payment request.",

But I assume we're talking noodle stoppers, not FREEing bunnies here? Museum putty is probably the way to go though, as there is still an adhesive in play with those pads, even if it's not a 'glue' per-se. Even masking tape, which is *designed* to be easily pulled off things will leave a stubborn, nasty ass residue if you leave it stuck on something long enough.",

Not sure what figures op has, but i got a couple banpresto ones from one piece, that are without base since they have a \"beach pose\"\n\nwas also thing using the wax, to make them earthquake proof :S",

The major concern is making sure you get putty without a dye; the original brand, blu tac, had a blue dye to make sure kids didn't mistake it got gum. My parents hung some of my art when I was a kid with it, and the blue dye eventually colored the wall (after several decades). Parafix does appear not to be dyed though, as the putty is a light grey normally.",

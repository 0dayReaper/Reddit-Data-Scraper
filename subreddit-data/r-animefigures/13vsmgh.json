Other than that she looks great. Oh also it's hard to do a good looking open mouth but they managed to nail it.",

Also the second (trio) character's prototype does not show any hints of castoff features as well, but that's debatable since it's probably just a render. And a lot of people (me incl.) don't really like the look of the nip pasties, so we are just curious to know since it's a decisive factor.\n\nAnd I guess people are kinda sceptical about private parts on figures these days.",

But sadly there are not many angel figures, and I just have way too many succubi lol. And with so many amazing POs I have no idea how to organize it honestly. [This was](https://imgur.com/a/fC9P042) a plan two.\n\nBut seeing that I PO'd way too many great figures, I'll most likely end up splitting them into 2 different shelves. One with just the Succubi and Ringo and the second with school girls (argh, Koakuma is both... my braaain). I am not really sure now, my whole plan is gone haha.",

But if she turns out good it'll be so worth it, with those big, tracking glossy eyes!\n\nOoh, I love both of those ideas! Literally all of these are figures that I've considered, Ringo is stunning! The struggle for angels is real though... \ud83d\ude14 Hotvenus has one announced, but it's pretty few and far between, or they're not as cute as I'd like. I'm hoping that the trend of petite angel girls picks up some traction since there's been a few recently, like the angel cop!\n\nLol, hey, playing the Tetris part is one of the most fun parts of figure collecting, it's frustrating until you get it right lol. Koakuma would fit in still, she's just the resident succubus of the school \u263a\ufe0f",

All and all, even if she really does, the eyes are mesmerizing and I wanna see the eye tracking feature finally!\n\nSeems like we have a very similar taste then! I also considered Kanna, but was kinda sad the bandaids were not removable. But after that, Koakuma, Ichinose, Eru and Yui all got painted back to back and my sadness turned to happiness haha. And now Kanon joins the fun (well at least I hope so, I hope the pasties can be removed). And yeah, though Eru aka the angel cop does not have wings if you cast off her top, which is kinda sad.\n\nTrue with the tetris, it feels really nice when you finally find the placement that works nicely! And Koakuma being resident school succubus, well, I wish my school had a cute succubus like that when I used to study lol... or did it :O\n\nEdit: Oh also I am keeping track of [this duo](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1778380). Even though I have rurumu already, this one might just turn out to be really cool.",

Typically I display my cast-offs cast-on, so I think I mentally just see her that way lol.\nAww, no wings?? That's such a shame! I think that's part of my gripe with Riasu, she doesn't have a dramatic silhouette without the wings. But Eru at least has that cute suspender pose!\n\nLol, you never know! ;) As a woman, collecting the lewd girls makes me think of all the repressed hormones I had. I identify with them, but of course that doesn't mean I promote anything \ud83d\udc80. It's just relatable!\n\nOooh, those are lovely, thank you for the heads up! \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\nI definitely have been waiting on [this piece](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1605215) by the same artist for a minute. Kuromu and Rumuru are so cute, if only they made the GK of the two into a prepainted.\n\nAlso, idk if you're into MFC like that, but if you are I could DM you my contact if you ever wanna fig chat/have new ones you're looking at!

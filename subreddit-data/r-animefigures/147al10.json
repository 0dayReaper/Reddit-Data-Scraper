Someone back when on here recommend dap rapid fuse I've used it a few times and it works well. Just be careful applying it. I recommend putting some on a piece of paper or cardboard and using something like a toothpick or anything small to grab some and rub it on. Stay away from edges so it doesn't ooze out when you push the pieces back together",

                    "comment": "&gt; DAP rapid fuse\n\nInteresting. I hadn't seen people recommend it before. Looking at the [material safety data sheet](https://www.dap.com/media/4795/3040804english.pdf):\n\nEthyl cyanoacrylate 65-85%\n\nMethyl methacrylate polymer 7-13%\n\nHydrophobic fumed silica 3-7%\n\nDimethyl sebacate 3-7%\n\nFumed silica 0.5-1.5%\n\nThe main component is ethyl cyanoacrylate, meaning the adhesive is the same as standard CA glue, but the percentage is lower than normal. Methyl methacrylate polymer is a plastic and is sometimes used in figures (PMMA). Along with Dimethyl sebacate, a plasticizer, I suspect there is a polymerization reaction occurring along-side the adhesive curing. I'd guess, based on the packaging, that the plastic is to make it very slightly more flexible, so it doesn't fracture as easily. [Reading up on fumed silica](https://www.adhesivesmag.com/articles/93225-understanding-the-role-of-fumed-silica-in-adhesives-and-sealants-formulations), it is used in adhesives to help it create a matrix when curing, which improves the shearing characteristics. This is likely what the packaging means by 2x more durable than super glue, as CA glue specifically had poor shear strength (~14 PSI). Still 2x is not that great an improvement compared to epoxy (closer to 400 PSI).\n\n**TL;DR DAP rapid fuse seems good and certainly seems to be better, but likely not in a way that really matters for figures when epoxy or metal pinning would otherwise be needed. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it, unless it is no extra effort.**",

    "postText": "It seems that after my last figure, I\u2019ve had nothing bad luck \ud83d\ude05. The Wiz figure is\u2026well\u2026okay at best. I\u2019m not a picky collector, but her face just doesn\u2019t look like the product shown (yes, I know product may vary.) That\u2019s not the only problem with this figure, however, as the right foot arrived peeling from the body and it doesn\u2019t fit on its base. I didn\u2019t even put a sink George in before realizing it wasn\u2019t going to fit unless I cut a peg off. \n\n(As a bonus, here\u2019s a Mirko with a rather large forehead compared to its other figures.)",

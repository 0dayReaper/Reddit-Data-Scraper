    "postText": "I've been debating to sell my detolfs and just go with using Billy book cases that I already have. I set up some of my figures already and really like the look of it overall and that it can go with my manga and merch. What I especially like is being able to see my figures more clearly. (Not sure if it would make a difference but I don't have lights in my detolfs and don't want them) \n\nSo I'm wondering if others prefer book cases instead and how well it works out with scale figures typically being bigger? Does it get too crowded? Are you able to display manga well with them? Any feedback or pictures would be appreciated!",

I have the middle unmoving shelf set with a bigger space, not putting books there instead I put my figures with bigger bases that won't fit in front of books.",

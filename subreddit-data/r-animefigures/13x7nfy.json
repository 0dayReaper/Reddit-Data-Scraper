    "postText": "As the above question states I'm planning on Pre-ordering a figure and that figure comes w/ an  \"**Illustrated Postcard\".** However I'm having issues deciding to go to pre-order from my local retailer (i.e KappaHobby), &amp; save on on shipping, or get it from a retailer that provides the bonus but pay a chunk more. I just wanted to know how likely the 'draft' images of the figure, found on MFC, to be the postcard. That way I have more info for choosing retainer.",

The eyes don't look finalized yet, don't even have the whites fully colored - this is still in production and they likely just did a quick outline for the eyes so she didn't have weird flesh-colored lumps there. These pics didn't come from the figure manufacturer, they're not official promo shots, they were tweeted out by Kyockcho after they got to see the in-production model.",

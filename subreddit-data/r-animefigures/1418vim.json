The only thing I would add is that over time, that temperature would be sufficient to cause sagging, assuming it is heavy. \n\nThe freeing 1/4 scale Jibril bunny, her wings sag under their own weight even in a cool environment. \n\nI feel it would be beneficial for us to know which figure op is talking about, I feel like anything that is naturally unbalanced will eventually be affected by temperatures that high.",

I have one from this line sitting on the dashboard in my car, it routinely breaks 130F, idk what that is in C. It gets really floppy at those temps.",

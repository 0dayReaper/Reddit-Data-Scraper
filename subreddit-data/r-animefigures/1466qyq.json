Also, I only just noticed that you insured literally every figure you bought. Standard plans are almost always a waste of money (esp when what u bought were prize figures) and you should note that if you insure your items, buyee will NOT let you downsize or alter any form of packaging to your package, this is a policy on their part which you can/should have read up on their website. As of now, buyee won't help you already because the consolidation work has already been completed. You either pay for the shipping or dispose the figures, which is unfortunate",

Their system is not clear and intuitive, but typically you want to avoid adding protective packaging and email them before paying to ask if they can reduce the box size and remove the item from the sellers shipping box before packing it again in their own shipping box. I dont think any of this information is clear on their website though, and I also wish YouTubers didnt promote it so much but good for them for getting paid.",

Go click on \"Select Shipping Method\" where you can see the different shipping options. My last order had an estimate of \\~$200 but the Buyee Air was actually $66.20 or 8,848 JPY. I received this package last week.\n\nI have a package that's listed as 13,580 JPY or $101.85 USD on the Package Information page, but when I click on \"Select Shipping Method\" I have options much cheaper than that. Buyee Air Delivery is listed as 4,924 JPY instead, which is around 1/3 of the estimated price.",

I\u2019ve since been going back and forth with their customer support giving them the ok to remove the extra protective packaging and doing whatever else they have to in order to downsize. I\u2019m most likely not getting some of the money back for choosing those extra options in the first place but if I can somehow get affordable shipping like you did it would be worth it than losing out on the figures and money I already spent.",

But to be fair it was indeed a lot of stuff. I did request downsizing but now I\u2019m worried about some of the figures that didn\u2019t come with a box (mostly prizes I got off Y!Auctions for like 1yen). Curious to see how they packed it.",

You really have to know what you're doing if you want to try and save.\n\nI only would ever use it to get something that would be impossible to find, like a very old/rare figure. Otherwise, stick to actual retailers.\n\nWhat you can do is request that they remove the shipping box that the items came in and reconsolidate. That can potentially lower the price but it still will almost 100% not be worth it for prize figures. Buyee just shoves the boxes that get shipped to them into a bigger box, they don't open the package to take out the figure box from the shipped box. Guess what, that's an additional fee.",

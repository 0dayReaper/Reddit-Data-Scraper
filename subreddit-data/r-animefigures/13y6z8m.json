You don't have the small boat with the crew provided with it from when the Merry burn ?\n\nI see you also have all the Megahouse POP kids but not Boa kid just like me.\nI have almost all main POPs and somehow i missed her and realised it only a few weeks ago.",

The kids one was deliberate, only the crew and Ace + Sabo \u263a\ufe0f\nYep I have all the Merry pieces but I prefer to display the \"perfect form\" ahah\nI also have lots of secondary characters but in the Figuarts Zero series (I posted a pic earlier if you want to check it out), POPs take up too much space \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude22 But congrats on yours!",

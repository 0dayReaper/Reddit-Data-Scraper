That's based on the two figures manufactured from them that i have and pictures i've seen. For what you get they should honesty be priced around 140-160 . Second thing is their quality control, you'd think they'd be better at QC at a 200+ price point but man. . time and time again they disappoint in my opinion. i'm being hard on them is because of their outrages prices. I want to believe that this figure will be good but honesty for me consumer photos on myfigurecollection from the company time and time again makes me want not to ever buy from them again.",

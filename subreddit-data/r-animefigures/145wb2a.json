    "postText": "At the end of May 2023, Reddit increased its pricing scheme for API access to the point where most third-party app developers would not be able to continue to provide them, as they would be faced with rates on the order of \"US $20 million per year\" which would be unlikely to be met even if they started charging their users. Apollo, reddit is fun, and Sync are some of the more prominent third-party Reddit apps which will cease functioning on June 30.\n\nThird-party apps would be further hobbled by not being able to access \"mature\" content through the API.\n\nThird-party apps are critical for users with visual impairments, as Reddit's official app has poor accessibility support.\n\nLosing third-party apps is [an important issue for Reddit's moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/), as their official app has only limited moderation tools.\n\nReddit's communications about these issues have [demonstrated an unwillingness to yield to the community's concerns](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/143rk5p/reddit_held_a_call_today_with_some_developers/). [An AMA with the founders of Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/) yesterday only reinforced the idea that they are not listening to their community and are only making a token effort to communicate.\n\nTo show our support for the community against Reddit's policy changes, this subreddit will be joining the blackout on June 12, starting at 0800 UTC. The subreddit will go private for 48 hours, meaning that posts will not be visible during that time.",

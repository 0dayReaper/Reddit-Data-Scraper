Our opinion on whether this figurine is worth at a certain price, should not affect your decision at all.\n\nyou like it and can afford it, and the price is lowest on the internet for this figurine? Nothing else for you to do aside from pressing the buy button.\n\nofc, at the end of the day its your choice, if you want to buy a figurine because someone think she is worth, go ahead. This kind of collecting is kinda pathetic imo tho. Like what is the point.",

It is really whether he think it is worth and he can't make up his mind.\n\nand again I said ' you like it and can afford it, and the price is lowest on the internet for this figurine? '. I would have assumed they done the market comparison, like it is the most basic thing, you just need to google.\n\nMakes more sense to ask like 'What do you think about this figurine', and makes more sense if the figurine is just freshly released or unreleased. Makes no sense to ask 'if this figurine released ages ago and super popular worth 160 bucks'. Heck, retail price is even higher than $160, even in the most fundamental resell means, $160 is worth unless this pre-own condition is screwed.",

We can always discuss studio's track record on how their prototype and the final product compares. We can talk about character, whether outfit is original or based on actual series, and postures/expressions. We can talk about studio's reputation - regardless how good the prototype looks, if it is from BFULL, everyone should avoid at all cost. Honestly a lot of things to talk about, mostly speculative but certainly makes more sense than asking if a figurine worth a certain amount of price.\n\nAnyway OP can have it his way, regardless if he googled after market price or not, this is a dumb question to begin with.",

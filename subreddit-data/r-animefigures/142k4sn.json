    "postText": "Lately they pumped Makise Kurisu from Steins;Gate like 4-5 figures to open for pre-order within a year. The latest sequel aired 5 years ago plus no anniversary related. I wonder what\u2019s up with that? Is it make sense for marketing? Are they gonna release a new sequel? Maybe MAGES planning on something? \nFeel free to share your thoughts!",

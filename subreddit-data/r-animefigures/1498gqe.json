                    "comment": "There are a few companies that produce this film. It has dispersed crystals in it, which move and spin in all directions on a micro level, which refracts light and makes the film opaque.\n\nApplying voltage to it lines up the crystals in the same direction, letting light through evenly.\n\nMost companies that produce it do large scale, but offer sample sizes such as in this case A4 format. As samples they are relatively cheap, I got them for about 20\u20ac per piece. This is just an experiment for me so it's good enough.\n\nYou could however order custom cut pieces of this film to apply to a whole shelf like a detolf or even bigger, which would be a little more expensive.

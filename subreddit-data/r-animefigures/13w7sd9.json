    "postText": "Like with how much figures cost, how is that okay?  The bases are literally the same composition as prize figure bases,  Same plastic.  Same hollow bottom.  On figures over $300 still\n\nI'm not saying that every figure has to have a sculpted base, but at least give us a solid clear acrylic base.  How much can that cost?  $10?  $15?  On a $300 figure?  Even if you passed the costs to us, I'm sure most collectors would welcome it.  Like if I'm getting a premium scale figure, I want a premium figure.  I don't want a nice figure to be ruined by cost cutting in one specific area.  \n\nMimeyoi and Neonmax already are doing it.  Alter and Max Factory need to keep up.",

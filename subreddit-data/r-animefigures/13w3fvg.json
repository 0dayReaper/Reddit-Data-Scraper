Maybe they just found a crate of forgotten figures and just needed to get rid of them? \nAnother interesting point, their description for the box mentioned that the 2 figures, plush, and nendoroid pin were a \u201ccombined original value of $110 USD!\u201d Curious wording when these are like $20 (at most) products \ud83e\udd14\nOh well lol, just thought it would be fun to share!",

If not for it, each nendo would have to averaged out to 72$ each (original price) or around there which would have given a better chance for some good ones....  Though it still might be undervalued...  Aqua is no longer on their website so can't tell what her original price was unless someone knows it.",

    "postText": "I pre-ordered a figure a year or so ago and it was supposed to ship at the end of May of this year; I went to check if they took the money, as I had not seen an email asking for a payment. I log in to their site and I find that my account was disabled due to non-payment. I checked my email's inbox and there was no email from them asking for payment. As it turned out, the payment email was buried in my spam. I missed the window to pay by 2 days or so and the figure is long sold out.\n\nI know that non-payment/cancellations are a big deal with these retailers, but would it be worth it for me to send an email explaining the situation and requesting that they lift the ban so I can buy from them in the future, or would it be unlikely for them to go back on a decision like that?",

    "postText": "Hello, First time posting here but wanted to share the results of the Figma Mystery Box I recently purchased during the memorial sale. Overall I am okay with the figures. I haven't watched his show but I do recognize Rimuru so that's pretty cool. I have no idea what Ronin is from but the samurai aesthetic is nice. The hololive character I know almost nothing about so I would say that's my least favorite. The pins are okay didn't really buy the box for them but I recognize Eren. I had forgotten it came with a pillow and only know that the character is from *Danganronpa*. Overall I think the box was a fun surprise and am glad I didn't get anything that I really hated but I definitely wouldn't have minded getting Jin Saki or Gridman. I would probably say Rimuru is my favorite of the bunch because I kinda know about the character. Also looks like theres a black bag in the box so I think it came with his goodsmile bonus.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9lrcl6i3x33b1.jpg?width=3432&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=758319fe1e315fa7827a973c92e36aaf339c83a6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/308m55i3x33b1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fb3c08dde826ee6427729674df23be0bb53dec41",

I've seen a couple figures where rereleases made odd changes like changing the bases, so wanted to make sure it looked good before ordering.\n\nMatches really nicely with that other white-haired girl on the right in your picture too (not familiar with that character).",

And yeah, it's definitely a bonus they are angled complimentary to each other. I just wish she was 1/7 instead of 1/8. That'd probably drastically increase her wingspan tho lol",

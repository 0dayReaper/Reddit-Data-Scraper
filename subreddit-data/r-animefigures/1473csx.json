    "postText": "Hellow dear community\\~\n\nWhile scrolling through here, I read that some people already received this figure (Sorry to the one with the broken arm, wish you all the best! :c). Made me remember that I preordered her myself but now I'm not sure if she's actually worth it, because she costs around half a thousand Euro here in Germany.\n\nFor those who got her already - what do you think about her? Did she meet your expectations? How's the level of detail, especially since she's 1/4?\n\nSome pictures would be really appreciated...\n\nIn Germany, preorders are expected to arrive in August, so I might have some time to cancel it.\n\nThanks for your opinions!  \n\n\n\\-------------\n\n\\-------------  \n\n\nEdit:\n\nShe certainly looks magnificent. The details in her marvelous body in combination with her substantial angelic wings and that somewhat demanding yet restraining facial expression and pose give the whole figure quite a pleasant vibe. From what I've seen in the photos she does have a very subtle smile on her face at specific angles which amplifies this effect. The antlers add a nice touch to the otherwise slightly empty hair too - like hair ornaments.\n\nAlso, I think she looks way better cast-on than cast-off. That dress fits her overall look very well.\n\nHhhhhhhhhh... But still - that's quite a tough decision to make. The more I think about it, the more I feel like that amount of money will kind of hurt my monthly invoice. I've never spent that much on a figure before... xD\n\nI'll sleep a couple of nights and will let you know the decision soon. Again, thanks for the help!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9644fbo0g5b1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b730c068cb5ab01fa261dd37432a8eaae72aa90f",

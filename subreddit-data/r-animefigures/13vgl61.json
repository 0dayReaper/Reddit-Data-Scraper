Which is why I said that the nekomimi maid figure seems more like Elaina. \n\nI have read the LNs, so I do know what her character is like, but the illustrator does have a tendency of giving Elaina a more easygoing and happy expression for the covers (also true for the promotional art for the anime), which could be part of the reason why figure companies have this more amiable impression of Elaina.",

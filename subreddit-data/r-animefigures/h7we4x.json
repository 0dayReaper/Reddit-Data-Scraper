Still got about 5 bottles of special crafting glue for the cardstock, a couple big packs of cardstock, boat resin, fiberglass and bondo in my parent basement from when i was making stuff. As well as a bunch of partially made projects. I listened to a lot of dubbed anime back then while working......good times. Thanks.",

The three as set would look awesome. (I'm looking for it myself as well, the aftermarket seems *bad*)",

I do have the 15th anniversary strawberry Miku Nendoroid pre ordered at a good price so I won't have to deal with that after market \ud83d\ude05 The Miku price figure behind them honestly kinda matches the set since she's also a 15th anniversary figure\n\nAlso Funko's are the only figures you can actually find in stores in Sweden so I just picked some up.\n\nThe Miku sticker set I just found cheap on AliExpress",

    "postText": "hello! i came here to ask this very simple question about a site that sells anime figures, plushies and more!\n\ni was looking for ages for this My Melody and Kuromi plushie that is a Sanrio Japanese Exclusive and from the web it seems its rare to find.. I've seen people complain about the website and such but is it worth it? is it a scam?\n\nonly reason why I'm asking this is because the plushie itself is around $16 CAD and that's such an amazing deal other than eBay with a 10cm plush going up for $300....\n\nanother thing! I've ordered from a Japanese site before and i had to pay tax duties, did anyone else experienced this before? they are a huge pain to pay for around $50 depending on the products price\n\nany detail and info from personal experience would be fantastic thanks!! ;3",

I\u2019ve heard the in-stock issues where mostly when they where switching warehouses which is a bit understandable since they had alot to transfer, and haven\u2019t really heard recent reports of in-stock issues. \n\nI\u2019ve not had to contact support but I\u2019ve heard they do take a bit to respond though",

They don't always have the stock they say they have.\n\nThat being said, they are also one of the places that pick up exclusives straight from Japan and resell it to other audiences so they can sometimes be your only option to get exclusives.",

Their customer service leaves alot to be desired, but for preorders their prices are usually good. They do rip you off with popular instock items though. Their shipping rates are fair and usually cheaper than Amiami. They also stock many exclusives from other shops with bonus items that other shops cant source.",

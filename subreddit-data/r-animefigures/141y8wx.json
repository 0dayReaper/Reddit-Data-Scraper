    "postText": "Hello r/AnimeFigures,\n\nI was looking for suggestions for a display/shelf by itself to use for my Steins;Gate figures. I currently own the entire 2011 anime figure set by banpresto and plan to add more to the collection, like the pop up parade okabe and kurisu, plus the kurisu-reading steiner figure (missed the pre order). It doesn't have to be to much, just something to hold just those figures on, like a glass display or regular shelf that is good quality.",

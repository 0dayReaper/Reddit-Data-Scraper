    "postText": "Hello! \n\nThis year has been a great year for pre orders. Well my wish came true. Trigun Stampede is making figures of the new anime. Trigun is my favorite anime property and I have the Trigun Stampede movie Kotobukiya figures that were released a while back. \n\nI was so ready to pre order thinking they would release sometime next year, nope December 2023. \n\nMan I have enough pre-orders already. I have to make a cut somewhere, but there are many pre orders that are high on my list. \n\nI will have to take a step back and really make some choices.\n\nHave you had to make this choice and if so did you regret it?",

            "comment": "There\u2019s more and more figures getting released so of course it\u2019s hard to keep up, especially when scales are no less than 20k-25k yen now\u2026 But it also means that most figures remain available longer, even after release with a pretty high chance (for some of them) to be even cheaper.\nAs some people on this sub already said, pre-ordering is not necessarily the best thing to do now (there\u2019s exceptions ofc). So well my advice would be to tell you to not stress over it so much. Keep the ones you really really want and/or the ones that may not be available after release, because most of them will probably be.",

I will say in all instances I either already had a scale of the character, or I didn't know the source all that well. I did not regret any of those cancelations. The larger your collection becomes the less importance you place on figures you only like well enough. I try to only buy new characters I love or figures that are massive upgrades of characters I already.",

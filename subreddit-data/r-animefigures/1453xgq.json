    "postText": "It was fun!! Lot of Mandarake!! I was looking for some specific series/stuff soo it only too my like 3 hours to get thru everything but surely it could've taken me the whole afternoon \ud83d\ude02\n\nI got the Archer Gilgamesh 3rd Ascension version! This guy goes for like high 6Ks - 7K+ regularly but I found him for 4.8k NEW (og retail price) \ud83d\ude33 I saw the price and new I had to grab him~~ Now I have a scale and the nendo for my fav boiii\n\nAlso grabbed my only planned Hatsune Miku Noodle Figure Flower Fairy Morning Glory! She's just so cute and delicate!! I love the design too with a flower skirt and translucent paintwork! Gives her an emphemeral beutsy just as the fairy namesake would suggest! She was a bit finicky to ensure she didn't fall over when trying to display her lol Probably gonna grab like those Earthquake adheseive pads to make sure she sticks &gt;&lt; A lot of the noodle stopper figures go for like 2k and I was a bit reluctant to spend that much on a noddle stopper but I found a shop in the corner of the 3rd(?) floor with a bunch of prize figures cheaper than the other stores! Got her for 1480 yen!\n\nI'd say this place is heaven for prize figures! Lots of options and you get chances to compare prices at different shops too! Nendoroids are pretty good selection too. Scale figures are kinda meh there's really only a couple places for those/high priced figures past like Dragon Ball or like Transformers. They did have a whole shop specifically for NSFW figures tho soo... (I saw multiple Kuroinu Olga for like 99k\ud83d\udc80But past that, scale figures was kinda scarce. Probs Akihabara will be better so looking forward to that tomorrow~. Gunpla/Model Kit selection is on par with nendos I'd say. Prize figures have the most then Nendos then scales greatest to least in selection size imo.",

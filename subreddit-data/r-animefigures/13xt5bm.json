A mark in a unlikely to be seen area &amp; marks on the base (which it can stand without or be replaced with something else.)\n\nOr I can get it for a slightly lower price than normal, around 100 USD cheaper but still 70 - 80 USD higher than the damaged one. \n\nWhat would you buy?",

Heck, the A/B would cost me 89,980 yen.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what the figure was, it\u2019s 1/4 Hachiroku by Native from the series Maitetsu.\n\nIdk why she\u2019s so expensive but she\u2019s the only 1/4 native loli that exists out there so maybe that\u2019s why afaik since almost every native loli is 1/6 or 1/7 or 1/8. It\u2019s a niche series even.",

I don\u2019t understand how the fabric was damaged, it looks like lint or something? The figure can be removed from the base &amp; stand on her on.\n\nThe other damage looks like two small scuffs on the top/back of one of her twin tails.

I haven\u2019t repainted or fixed fabric based items before. I\u2019ve painted over fishnets before but not felt fabric.\n\nIf it\u2019s a permanent discolouration you may want to consider the more expensive but undamaged option, it seems like something that would be quite jarring and it doesn\u2019t seem easily fixable to me at least. Unless you\u2019ve had experience with fabric dyes I don\u2019t really know how to fix it either.\n\nThe difference in price though? If it\u2019s just 50usd or so, I think it\u2019s fairly justifiable for the undamaged option.",

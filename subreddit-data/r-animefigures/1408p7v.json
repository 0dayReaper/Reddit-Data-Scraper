Except for the IK one hahaha. For me, this IK looks like a decent scaled one compare to Megahouse even its not \ud83e\udd23",

I can't speak for either of their quality but it feels like a good next step\n\nGreat collection by the way! This is the kind of thing that takes dedication and I respect that. Which of the scales is your favorite? Even though Gojo isn't my #1 favorite character, he's certainly the most merchandised one and I was wondering what would be a good scale to start with.",

What are your thoughts on the one with the red effect? I\u2019ve been debating that one myself \ud83d\udc40\n\nI know you\u2019d love the Dtalon Gojo resin figure, but his tamagotchi would be super cute in your collection! Do you have his lookup figure? Also cute! Most recently I ordered his Vol 0 pup bc his pose is tdf.\n\nI know you\u2019d love the 1/4 Dtalon Gojo resin figure (unlicensed though :( ), but his tamagotchi would be super cute in your collection! Do you have his lookup figure? Also cute! I personally love the 1/6th action figure by FigZero. I linked a few other prize figure-y ones below that I\u2019m looking to grab at some point. I won\u2019t recommend the new Megahouse one since even I am unsure how I feel about his face! What do you think of it?\n\nhttps://myfigurecollection.net/item/1776519\nhttps://myfigurecollection.net/item/1851214\nhttps://myfigurecollection.net/item/1714407\nhttps://myfigurecollection.net/item/1851193\nhttps://myfigurecollection.net/item/1781827\nplus the Ending Costume 2 noodle stopper!\n\nEdit: only saw Gojo and missed the part where you were trying to find figures that filled the shelf spaces. \ud83d\udc80",

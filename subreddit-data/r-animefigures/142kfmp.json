I don't mind coughing up good money for an expensive figure, Hell I gladly cough up money for Bunny figures easily but the shipping prices have really been getting to me these past two years. I know it was because of COVID which is understandable, and things are slowly getting back on track but I think this hobby is slowly starting to outprice me with Shipping Prices.\n\nLuckily I always use HLJ Shipping Discount codes and for my Bunny figures I use Goodsmile GLobal flat shipping which is amazing. Yet even with regular scale Figures I'm starting to get bummed on the Shipping Prices. I'm just not sure how long I can really keep up with hobby as I used to and eventually I might even stop simply because of the Shipping Prices. \n\nwell.... maybe not stop, just buy like 1 or 2 Figures a year or something.",

Shipping is already expensive, what's another \u00a346.69 on top to have it fully insured and in my hands immediately (after the taxman takes their time assessing).\n\nAssuming it's \u00a3450 in that box, it's 10 successful orders before it would be \"acceptable\" for one to be lost. \nI'm sure it pays for itself in the long run, but you need to be ordering (in AmiAmi's case) every month for it to be worth it if you do lose a parcel. Is 1 in 10 a high rate? Probably I guess? But that's what's insurance is for, for that 1 in 10 case.\n\nI've got 5 individual items coming by surface as a mental check to try and adopt this mindset so by end of August I will have my info to decide whether it's a route I want to pursue. \n\nThen also the figure price could decreased in the time for it to be delivered but that's another issue we're facing.",

Most of my figures were ordered from Solaris which has an option for shipping insurance no matter which method used. I also have collectors insurance for my collection that I pay $75 per year for. My policy covers the loss of or damage of newly purchased figures during the shipping process. So I feel pretty adequately protected when choosing surface mail. \n\nAs far as figure prices decreasing during shipping time, I\u2019ve read and seen the current trend of preorder prices dropping post release. Regardless, unless you were planning on selling right away, I don\u2019t think that has any relevance. If you like a figure and want to have it and did research on the best currently available price amongst all the reputable stores, then it\u2019s always a solid buy. I do my best to find a figure I want at the best price I can when I am ready to purchase it. Whatever happens afterwards doesn\u2019t matter because I don\u2019t really intend on selling. I just make sure not to pay way more than original MSRP because that\u2019s always a scam (unless the figure is rare/hard to find). \n\nIn the end, to each their own. I\u2019ll always choose surface mail because I can\u2019t justify the extra cost of shipping when I can just wait lol I recently ordered 2 nendoroids via surface mail from Solaris and they shipped it via FedEx instead at no extra cost. Took no more than a week to arrive. Other figures I ordered have reliably arrived 2 months post shipping email, which I don\u2019t think is long at all.",

I tried looking for some sort of third party shipping but obviously it's a narrow concept to find. \n\nCould you explain more about this?

You can ask if they can write a policy that not only covers your collection, but also covers newly purchased figures during shipping.

It's okay.\n\nThe worst thing I had to get accustomed to, however, is that in 2021 the EU abolished the VAT limit, so starting from that time VAT needs to be paid for everything imported into the EU without exceptions. The amount of VAT varies by country, it's usually around 20%, but in my country it's 27%.\n\nAnd then I already heard news that they plan to abolish the duty fee limit. At the moment we need to pay an additional 4.7% duty fee on top of everything, but only when the total value of the package exceeds 150\u20ac. They would abolish this limit, so the 4.7% would need to be paid for everything. \n\nBtw this 4.7% is not added together with the VAT percent, but multiplied. So it's not 27%+4.7%=31.7%, but 1.27\u00d71.047=1.32969, so it's effectively almost 33%.\n\nAnd then there is the rising of the figure prices too.",

I've started to buy PUPs from stores like BBTS, as well as prizes, as their boxes are huge and make the shipping cost what the figure does. I always buy 1/6 or larger from GSC US/Japan (it'll now be Japan, as the US one doesn't discount shipping anymore), and as for AmiAmi, I just suck it up, but try to keep orders small and mostly just goods with a figure or two (nendo size) in there. I won't use surface again (I start getting anxiety if I have to wait too long), so I'm stuck with DHL or EMS, though it is definitely a viable option. I wish Ami2 would open up more options. They're the cheapest store in terms of shipping, but have only a small amount of options (they really are. I've bought from HLJ, HS, and Ami2 in the past, and HS tends to be more for every option. HS is even more limited than Ami2 and charges tax, so screw them beyond this month's mini order), There's no good reason Ami2 shouldn't add FedEx, UPS, or ECMS to their list. These methods tend to be cheaper.",

And that\u2019s just the base price, BBTS has cheap shipping, but many other stores will still charge full price shipping.

I enjoy figure collecting as a hobby and simply pointing out it's not as expensive as cars and some other hobbies. A hobby is where you choose to spend time and sometimes money on.  You chose to spend on bullets which are hella expensive, guns too, and disappear with no recoup costs besides the joy of using it. It's not a cost saving hobby choice of change.

Then decide on what face you want and switch that out. And lastly mess with arms and legs. Unfortunately like 5-10 different companies make Nendoroids and some are more janky than others.",

Sometimes, you get figures like the Kaguya-sama trio, which are notoriously bad.  \n\n**How Complicated It Is**  \nDozens and dozens of my Nendos are extremely simple. There isn\u2019t much other than a few face plates and some alternate arm poses etc. On the other end of the spectrum, you get the absurdly complex models with a slew of accessories and awkwardly posable limbs.   \n\nAll in all, you kind of get used to it. Sure, there are some that gave me a headache (I\u2019m looking at you K-on and your infuriating guitar straps), but most of the time that little bit of effort is well worth the unique look that the figure provides.",

At first it took me *forever* to set them up and I'd be dropping stuff everywhere, but nowadays I'll only spend ~15 to finish my desired pose. \nSome nendos though are just not made as well as others with loose joints and weird fitting parts that I can only describe as jank. Toytec is infamous for making subpar quality figures while I've had good luck with others like OR.\n\nI'd buy a lot more scales/prizes if I had the space!

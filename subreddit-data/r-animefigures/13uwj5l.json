May need to get more shelving space from IKEA to display my incoming POs~",

I'd say you've achieved an awesome equilibrium there!\n\nWhat would you say are your favorite(s) out of all of them?\n\nLoving all the Miku's, and Mona from Genshin Impact. The one in the (violet?) outfit to the very right on the same shelf as Mona looks so pretty, who is she?\n\nYour Nendoroid set-up looking slay as well.",

I've spent a lot of time rearranging the figures left and right I'm happy you like it :D \n\nMy favourite has to be either the Myethos Shaohua Miku or Little Mermaid!! The Little Mermaid costed me an arm and a leg straight from a personal MFC Taiwan seller who sold me all the bonuses, including the wall scroll, post card and the 3D standee haha \n\nThe one in white hair and violet is Lena from the Light Novel/Anime called -86- eighty six, she's also quite lovely imo, one of my most favourites in my collection! \n\nThere are more nendoroids not shown here hehe xD Will have to post an update after I've rearranged my shelving at home~ Thank you for your lovely comment!",

Oh and you're very welcome! c:\n\nI'll have to look at the picture again after I send this since otherwise I think I'll lose this page, but I think I remember them!

You scored so hard getting her!\n\nYou're very welcome again!\n\nI only have a couple figures to my name (with another one being on the way!) but I've got plenty stored up in my wishlist over on MFC. I can DM you my MFC list if you're curious to take a look around. lol Up to you!\n\nI also gave you a follow if you don't mind!",

If you enter the PO screen you cant even select it.\n\nItems that are in the normal section but look nsfw can however be paid with paypal.\n\nI think the condition for something to land in the 18+ section is sexual actions or items. Pure nudity is not enough because i have seen a loli cast off by henreader a while ago on the normal section.\n\nFor example i have the 4th elf villaget figure by asanagi. Its cast off and still in normal section.\n\nTldr: if its in normal section you can pay with paypal regardles of how the figure looks atleast in my experience",

            "comment": "Before people start talking about how tempered glass is bad and you should get normal glass...\n\nI am starting to hate this frikking misconception. Tempered glass is in no way more prone to shattering than regular glass. People just assume so for whatever damn reason. Tempered glass is way more resistant to force (and scratches) than normal glass. The issue is when you apply pressure on the edges (and from a side) or if you get a bad piece (badly made cuts that chipped the glass or left some microcracks). And that literally goes for both types the same way. Tightening the screws with force like you would do with wood or no cushioning between glass x metal hinges are usually the issues with detolfs (they use very poor cheaply made hinges).  You can smack tempered glass with a hammer with a decent force and it would not shatter compared to regular glass. But take both types, hit it in the corner or from a side with something small and you are done.\n\nYou know what normal glass would do? Shatter into sharp pieces and maybe leave big pieces on the edges, that's it. Probably would do so way sooner though.",

Not that I think tempered glass is worse than normal glass or that I specifically blame its being tempered glass for what happened, but from what I looked up there are some factors in the tempering process that might produce defects, which may have been the cause of this breakage. That, and maybe the screws too.\n\nThat aside, about the screws though, I've read comments on my last post that said the screws only interact with metal frames in the detolf and thus doesn't pressure the glass panels. Meanwhile there are lots of posts and comments recommending loosening those roof screws. Not sure which is true. Do you have any further input on this issue?",

Overtightening the screws is definitely the main culprit for these incidents. Glass wouldn't randomly explode like this otherwise, unless it experiences a lot of temperature changes and the glass is made improperly and has internal stress (though unlikely).\n\nThe internal metal part only holds the glass panels, and actually doesn't hold the top up at all.",

You can receive an impure metal from someone who just slams pieces together, while a pro would clear the impurities as much as he can/wants making it better (like with sword smithing)\n\nThat doesn't make any sense. Yes, the screws tighten up the hinge, there is no direct contact between the screw and the glass (how even could be, it's not like the glass has thread lol) but you are basically tightening the area inbetween the two parts of the hinge (that's where the glass is, right). So you are putting indirect pressure on the glass panel. Other thing is, if you are putting glass doors on, you have several hinges. If you tighten up the middle one way more than the top/bottom one (I mean the screws that change the depth and position etc) you can create a lot of diagonal pressure (like forcing the glass to bend). That might be as bad. But not usual since people usually tighten everything to the same point of pressure (probably too much).",

So a small \"gravel\" or anything in the rails where the glass reside, too much force applied (because of over tightening or weight on top) and some aggravating factor like temperature change, etc... can easily push the glass over the breaking point.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut if during assembly you make sure that the groves where the glass sits are clean, barely tighten them and don't put anything heavy on the top, then they are unlikely to explode on their own unless you were very unlucky and got a glass with a defect.",

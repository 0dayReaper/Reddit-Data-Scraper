    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m new to figure collecting, and a year and a half ago my mom and I preordered the Chika Fujiwara (Ultra Romantic Seaside Ver.) figure on Tokyo Otaku Mode back in April 2022. When we ordered it back then it had a release date of I believe November 2022\u2026only for it to be pushed back to May 2023. Then today my mom gets an email saying it\u2019s gonna be pushed back to JULY 2023. \n\nI know TOM is a very reliable and legit figure selling site\u2026my mom thinks we\u2019ve been scammed. I keep trying to tell her we haven\u2019t and that these pushbacks are normal from what I\u2019ve researched\u2026but now I\u2019m getting anxious because these pushbacks are getting my mom very upset, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll never be able to purchase a figure on a site like that ever again, and everyone who knows figures knows you never buy a figure on Amazon because of bootlegs. \n\nAre these pushbacks normal?? And have any of you preordered this figure as well??",

            "comment": "It's very normal depending on who's the maker and where you get it from. If you get it from TOM, BBTS or other American vendors, the figure usually travels from Japan to the US, then to wherever you're from. As for makers........well, there's a reason why Alter is nicknamed \"Later\". The rest are more or less on time.\n\nIf you and your mom want to get your figures faster (in general) and/or don't want to go through the worrying and hand-wringing, then I suggest you buy directly from Japanese vendors like AmiAmi or HobbySearch, they both have very good English/international websites. It's even better if you're able to pay in yen, to avoid the inevitable markups from the banks or card issuers when it comes to currency conversion.\n\nThe two major drawbacks are the shipping and the GST - it can get a bit expensive if your location is only served by DHL or other foreign shipping companies, instead of by Japan Post's Express Mail Service (EMS). Do check it out before you make any purchases. Prices on their websites are also usually *before* GST, so be prepared for that.",

I ordered a spice and wolf holo pop up parade from surethingtoys in march of 2022, the figure released in july of 2022 and it's now June of 2023 and it's still getting pushed back. Every month it tells me it's being released that month and then it switches to next month lol.",

            "comment": "The reason why it takes so long is dependent on where you order the figure. There are multiple factors playing into it. \n\n1) TOM first needs to receive the figure, which takes a long time since they probably get them by surface (boat). This happens usually when you pre order from US sites \n\n2) If the figure is delayed for multiple months, shipping takes long to reach the warehouse, and then they have to ship it once again to your address.\n\n3) Some figures are up for pre orders up to more than 1 year before releasing. It's very normal it takes a long time. \n\n4) MFC (my figure collection) is a good place for updates.",

They get delayed all the time.  Some figures longer than others.   Some release on time and some don't.  It really has a lot to do with the figure manufacturers themselves and not TOM.   But tbf TOM usually is a lot slower with shipping figures out when they release than sites like ami ami.  TOM can be slower, but Ive really only ordered from them because I like that I can pay it all upfront. Plus I really don't mind waiting.",

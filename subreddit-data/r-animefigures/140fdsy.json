I haven't gone too far, but it almost feels like you may be able to do so in a reversible way (don't quote me on that though).\n\nAs for the feels of her legs &amp; ass, I guess they feel a little glossier than you basic PVC texture.",

But it looks like shit if you do so.\nThe fact that her hair doesn't cover the nipples is a fucking amazing surprise.\nMy guess is that, you either wanna just straight up cut the flappy thingies, or try to move them around using a hair dryer? Since the elasticity of those is pretty great (they're so sturdy as well, considering their size).\n[here some pictures of it](https://imgur.com/a/gldoqeA)",

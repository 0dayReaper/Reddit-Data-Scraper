If you get a good contact with the plastic, it will not be the adhesive that fails. Assuming these claws don't normally fail, there was likely a defect in the plastic and gluing it would likely fix the issue. But, as the other poster alluded to, driving metal through perpendicular to the surface of the break likewise prevents it from shearing.",

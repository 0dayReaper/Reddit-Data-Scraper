Nendo in today, &amp; trying to find an alternative to the [Milight 316W](https://www.hlj.com/milight-316w-mini-led-white-hms99152) mini LED for her trike &amp; lantern. The one [GoodSmile recommends](https://www.goodsmile.info/en/products/slide/97477) is out of stock on Hobby Link. Anyone had success with different brands?

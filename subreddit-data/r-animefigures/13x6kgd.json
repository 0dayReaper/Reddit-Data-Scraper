    "postText": "Ordered from AmiAmi a few months ago. Didn't have space for it and now have no desire to keep as I no longer have as much interest in the character and am spending too much on figures. Completely unopened and has been stored safely in closet since arrival.\n\nWill be shipped in AmiAmi box with packaging to keep safe.I have left the box and plastic completely unadjusted so the images are a little less clear as there is a lot of plastic inside and outside the box.\n\nImages: [https://imgur.com/a/I4MFPgD](https://imgur.com/a/I4MFPgD)\n\nPrice: \u00a3154.99 (around $190). Listing is on ebay but comment/DM if you want to directly purchase. Willing to negotiate price, please comment/DM or make offer on ebay listing.\n\neBay listing: [https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/404287927574](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/404287927574)",

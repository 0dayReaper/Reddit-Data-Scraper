(The comment section on her mfc page is full of disappointed people lol)\n\nMight be a good idea to put a support on the lowest curve of her left pigtail",

That one did droop while I was waiting for a replacement from Goodsmile. (BTW they totally do send pieces that are also defective when you request a replacement- thankfully the replacement piece that I needed replacing the most only had a paint defect on it.)\n\nMy new one hasn't, but I did what I suggested above as a short term preventative measure and it seems to be holding so far. \n\nIn the long term, I'm going to see if I can make an acryllic support for her.\n\nEdited for clarity",

My last figure was more than 7 months ago, so there's a lot of time to save up in between pre-orders. But I have like 10 scales coming out before the end of the year lol.\n\nIn terms of deciding which ones, I try to only buy figures that resonate with me. I feel like whenever I look at my collection, it doesn't really feel like it could belong to anyone else. :) I'm sure my friends could easily tell which collection is mine if they had to pick it out of many, and that makes me happy.",

Next month I think I have two that will release. Then one in September and another in November. After that I think there\u2019s like a 4-6 month gap of no figures preordered releasing for me.\n\nJust depends lol",

I don't really pre order too many unless I think the aftermarket is gonna suck like danganronpa figures. Or the nekopara native figure",

            "comment": "When I first started collecting, I would buy at least 3+ figures per month and it was mostly on impulse. I only ever bought figures from the anime\u2019s I know.  I was in deep fomo during that starting time and I didn\u2019t want to miss out on figures I wanted. I made a lot of mistakes with my money and I\u2019m unlearning that bad habit of fomo/impulse buying. Now I am semi planing out my preorders for that certain month and seeing if I will/will not have the money for them. It\u2019s hard but I\u2019m getting there lol\n\nI am also learning about waiting and wish listing figures I wanted but missed out on preorder period. It\u2019s so I can either save up the money or see if the they lived up to the prototype. Comparing the past to now, I\u2019m kinda happy I don\u2019t spend money on figures every month. It\u2019s kinda good having months where I don\u2019t have to worry about buying this figure or payment requests. Now it\u2019s reduced to like 1 - 3 orders certain months. Sorry for the long message lol.",

I have totals so I can see in black and white how much I\u2019ve spent and how much I would spend in an effort to manage my spending. I try to limit myself to 1, maybe 2 scales a month but last month I ended up buying 1 and preordering 3. I\u2019m legit concerned about my spending as this can get out of control",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I had a question of why AmiAmi seems so behind on orders lately? I haven\u2019t bought from them in awhile but it seems like they\u2019re having trouble fulfilling orders (I\u2019ve mainly seen it be a issue for surface shipping) for others and now I\u2019m hesitant if I should order from them again. I heard of people apparently waiting months even after release until their order finally shipped. What\u2019s your experience lately with AmiAmi? The last time I ordered from them was in 2021.",

            "comment": "They were much much more behind shippings just until a very few months ago, when they visibly changed something. Before then in my experience it almost became the norm that they shipped packages 30 days after payment. But just now they shipped out a surface package of mine after 8 days, but I had some other recent packages that were shipped more quickly. \nBtw the trend of lengthening shipping times started to become really noticeable around summer last year.\n\nI also keep track all of my order data, so I made a graph out of it:\n\n[AmiAmi: Days untils shipping after payment](https://i.imgur.com/h7hv9zJ.png)\n\nUpdate: [same kind of graph for Mandarake](https://i.imgur.com/ulK0Yy8.png)",

For me older data suggests that surface generally takes longer to ship out, but recent data largely eliminated that difference.\n\nBtw I always thought it's weird that for Surface Premium they can't even send notification about when the package leaves their hands (that is AmiAmi/Japan). I mean that's how it works, right? You in the US only get update once it got there.",

Multiple stores seemed to be moving slower than in the past back at the beginning of the year, but I think AmiAmi had the worst time of it. I think they just didn't have enough people to pack and ship the orders. If they hired more over the spring, that would explain the improvement.",

With Surface Premium, it has to wait for amiami to accumulate enough orders to fill a shipping container on their own, so it can take longer. In my (years) of ordering from amiami, there's always been a delay between order paid-for and then shipped (via surface).",

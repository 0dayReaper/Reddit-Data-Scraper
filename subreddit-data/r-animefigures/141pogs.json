The horizontal stripes on her legs, are they supposed to be gold or like the majority of pictures, sort of grayish brown? I've seen a few where it's bright gold and was kind of hoping for that.\n\nEdit for context: I have seen people discussing defects for this figure, but I was not able to find any of those posts, cuz reddit search sucks",

I don\u2019t have a picture for her alone unfortunately.",

I've onpt bought stuff form $10-$40 I would like some opinion :))",

So far i've got like $1400 worth of statues, nendoroids, figmas and mafex. looking back if i never bought them i could have gotten something that would have served me better like a New gaming PC.\n\nif you don't know what a proper anime figure is like you can always buy one thats on sale from amiami.\nhttps://www.amiami.com/eng/c/sale/?page=1164\n\nThese are figures that didn't sell worth shit and are just collecting dust, but they're still good. just not popular.\n\nlike this $150 figure thats on sale for like $60\nhttps://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=FIGURE-048248\n\nin my opinion their not worth it. Eventually you'll grow out of the hobby.",

Rule of thumb standing 1/4 scales can range from 35-45cm (14-19\u201d) while sitting 1/4 scale tend to be 20-30mm (8-12\u201d). \n\nMFC: Has info in mm( x10 to convert to cm) The for figure height so you may need to look it up. I\u2019ll provide you some cost efficient samples based on height (because usually LxW tends to be consistent - but not always)\n\nFor figure 40cm or shorter: [25x25x40cm](https://www.amazon.com/Acrylic-Collectibles-Assemble-Alternative-20x20x30/dp/B0B3WMXPKL/ref=mp_s_a_1_2_sspa?crid=1CRHHB5JYOL4C&amp;keywords=acrylic+display+case+20+inches+tall&amp;qid=1685986298&amp;sprefix=Acrylic+Display+Case+20%27%27%2Caps%2C165&amp;sr=8-2-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzNEI2UjFUTFNCUzRRJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjEzNDA4M0NKMEtFSDNWNVBIUiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzk4MjI5MklHMTJMNEVPQkdWVCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX3Bob25lX3NlYXJjaF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl) you can even get the shorter variant if they are sitting\n\nFor taller options I don\u2019t have much experience with them I found [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Odoria-Acrylic-Self-Installation-Display-Dustproof/dp/B092DJJJ2Q/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?crid=1CRHHB5JYOL4C&amp;keywords=acrylic+display+case+20+inches+tall&amp;qid=1685986965&amp;sprefix=Acrylic+Display+Case+20%27%27%2Caps%2C165&amp;sr=8-4&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.006c50ae-5d4c-4777-9bc0-4513d670b6bc) on Amazon going for 20in (50cm) which should be able to fit any of them",

In the UK I've seen a few large acrylic cases on Amazon / eBay in the past, aimed at people that want to display trophies and teddy bears. Can't speak of their quality, but I'll probably have to plump for one of those in a few months when I get my own bunny that will fit in literally nothing I own!",

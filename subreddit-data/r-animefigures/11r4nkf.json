On the wall to the left of this display I have 6 full-size Ikea Billy bookshelves which are used for special figure displays and autographed items. I have a restaurant-style display case that has a replica sword from Demon Slayer along with production art and storyboards from various series. The remaining walls have framed production cels and director-signed movie posters (I still need to install a couple short Billy bookshelves to serve as dedicated Nendoroid displays).",

I don't have a real high paying job, but for a single person it is plenty, and I am fairly cheap outside of this hobby. The biggest thing that worked in my favor was entering the housing market in early 2011 after the US market crash. I bought my first condo well under previous market value for $62k, and by the start of the housing boom in 2020 I was able to sell it for $137k and upgrade to this current condo which had a 1,000 sq ft basement that I could finish.",

Any tips you can share about what worked and what didn't? Also are you just using solid colors for the art or are you trying to match the textures etc. in the background? Are the shelf bases also on foam board or just directly on the vinyl?",

I wanted to pick your brain about a topic that is giving me a lot of difficulty in selecting my furniture pieces for the display. \n\nThese glass shelves from Ikea seem to be the gold standard but the glass gives me pause. I realize that catastrophic failures and the destruction of a collection is very rare compared to the amount of these sold and used, but I just can't seem to get over not wanting my collection to have a chance of being in that small percentage. This collection and display of yours is a massive undertaking so what makes you comfortable using them?",

Now that the price has been raised substantially ($129, more than twice the price I bought mine at) I would not consider them the best option at all. At this point, I would recommend looking for alternative options if you want to go with the full glass design, or consider using the Billy bookshelf with Morliden doors (part of my autograph area: https://imgur.com/tPuaU9D and https://imgur.com/vbtXJpA).\n\nAs far as level of confidence in the Detolf, I have seen some cases of catastrophic failure, though a few of those involved either excess weight placed on the shelf or the metal rails being installed backwards so that the shelves had less support. In my case, I've owned most of these cases for 12-16 years and multiple moves without issue.",

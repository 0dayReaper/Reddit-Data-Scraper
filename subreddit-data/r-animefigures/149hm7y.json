Prices includes shipping within the United States, message if you'd like to inquire about international shipping. Kaworu's upper body tends to disconnect from the lower torso easily, but can still be posed with some effort. Besides this, both figures are in great condition along with their boxes.  \n\n\n*  $86 - Shinji Ikari - Plugsuit Ver. - Nendoroid #1445\n* $86 - Kaworu Nagisa - Plugsuit Ver. - Nendoroid #1446",

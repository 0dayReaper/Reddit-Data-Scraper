Depending on strength, they can get pricy, but you have small spaces, so you could probably pick some up at very reasonable prices for a four or six pack. I don't leave mine on all the time to save myself the hassle of remembering to constantly recharge them. But when I have folks over or just feel like turning them on, seeing them light up on their own is such a nice feeling.",

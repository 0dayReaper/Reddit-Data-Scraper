Doesn't look like paint peeling but the plastic didn't fill the mould properly or chipped plastic (PUPs are mostly colored plastic).\n\nFixing it would require puttying and sanding the \"hole\" and then painting over it. But because the rest of her skin isn't painted, you'll need to paint the entire thing for it to blend in well.",

I've repaired figures with colored plastic skin and I had to paint the entire body for visual cohesiveness jut to fix smaller defects.\n\nIf she wasnt purchased that long ago try to return her ig. Otherwise you are best off just trying to ignore it.",

I could do without the chest being so big but I can get used to it lol. Anyone know of a figure with a similarly cute face?",

I was referring to RB's quality has been falling off when it comes to certain details.. you know the sensitive stuff when I look at their recent releases and upcoming stuffs. \n\nMeanwhile other brands actually put more effort into them, especially nowadays newer brands like Vibrastar, Lovely are rising up with equal or even better quality",

Once you get to a certain point, you feel like you can coast.  Then, at the same time, everyone else improves.  \n\nI don't have anything from RB, though, so I can't really compare or speak to a drop in quality hoohas. I've always kinda viewed Pink Charm as one of those bigger companies.  Lewd figs seem to mainly come from those sorts of companies.\n\nI'll have to check out RB stuff, though.  See if there is anything that catches my eye.",

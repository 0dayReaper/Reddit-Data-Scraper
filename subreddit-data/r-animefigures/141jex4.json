For now she's easily one of my most detailed and favorite figures I own haha \ud83d\udc95\n\nHonestly was afraid she wouldn't arrive at all,- Im fairly new to figure collecting (almost a year) and don't have a lot of experience with Preorders, the shop I pre-ordered her is based in Europe (cus seemed the smartest idea considering where I live) and they listed her as \"will be out around December 2023\" though she never did. The shop never mentioned anything about a delay until a year later, when I kind of forgot that I had pre-ordered her in the first place, they suddenly emailed me saying my Package was out for shippment and would arrive in 3-10 days.",

I was about to ask how long you've been into figure collecting, but your second paragraph already answered that for me! I'm new to figure collecting as well (first figure arrived a little over two months ago). \\^\\^ In fact, my third is due to arrive very soon hopefully, assuming there are no delays! It took me ages to find her so technically I could say she's my first ever grail. &lt;33\n\nIf you don't mind me asking out of curiosity, do you remember how you got into figure collecting? :3\n\nThat's very unfortunate! I'm glad she arrived safe and sound though, like I said. c: I ordered my first two figures by seamail just days apart from each other and the second one arrived at my doorstep within a few days. However, my technically first figure came a little over a month after that after being stuck in a sea port in Japan for a bit.\n\nApologies if any part of my reply is a little incoherent and I'm not seeing it. I didn't get the best of sleep last night, heh. :')",

Should say that my family choose to cut all ties and contact with her after the court ruled \"child endangerment\" during the divorce trials, so I thankfully haven't seen or talked to her once in the past 8 years. Not important! So when I was 13 years old my Mother tried to win me over, she tried to get us to love her so we would tell court we wanted to live with her...didnt work, by inviting me out to my first convention ever. Though I didn't feel comfortable going with her alone so I...kinda tricked a close friend (who was also really into anime and video games, still is though we slowly grew apart over the years) into coming with...it was the best day of my life.\n\nNot because my Mother was the one who came with us but because...okay picture this, two little overly chaotic gremlins running around their first ever convention trying everything to make live hell for their guardian...and I mean everything, we tried to purposely lose her multiply times or forced her into really crowded places, loudly playing a game of \"guess where the Cosplays from\" of series and characters she knew shit about and \"forcing\" her to buy us the most expensive Merch we could find.\n\nMy mother has a strong obsession with her own image...so my friend and I where trying our hardest to abuse this fact as much as possible, obviously she was the adult and we where the children so all the \"hellish torture\", we could put her through was acting as really annoying children or pulling harmless pranks...i think the only reason we got her to even buy us Merch was because she was to afraid to lose her mask of a \"good, attentive and loving mother\" infront a large crowd. My first figure was a Hatsune Miku price Figure from Sega, while I love vocaloid and am a huge fan, Miku never belonged to my favorites (prefer Vocaloids with lower voice ranges)...but hey at the time that 30\u20ac price was the most expensive I could find, eh. \n\nMy second figure I got two years ago when I finished school and received my first ever paycheck, the first thing I bought was a Taito Hatsune Miku price Figure (still love her a lot), as if to say: ,,Who needs you? I can do way better without you!\", though I didn't start actually collecting until a year later when I bought my first nendoroid and Scale Figure.\n\n....this got way longer than expected...sorry that you have to read through all of that. What's your grail? when you don't mind me asking and what was your first figure?",

I have always been known to ramble. X3\n\nFair enough. XD The only reason I know it's been a couple months since my first arrival is due to the receipts. If it weren't for them it easily could have been 6 months. I'm the worst at keeping track of time, honestly!\n\nDon't worry about it honest, vent all that you need to! I don't mind in the slightest. c: I'm really sorry you've had to deal with all of that though! You have my sincerest empathy!\n\nI won't go into my situation as deeply but basically my mother is your traditional Bible thumper who thoroughly believes in traditional gender roles and all that so if she saw that I have collected a few anime figures she'd be a lit gasket unfortunately. Luckily she barely visits my room so I can keep them out a decent amount of the time, but if need be I can always tuck them away safely. \n\nI'll look these figures up soon (the very firsts that you mentioned), but I am sure they are lovely! \\^\\^\n\n[https://myfigurecollection.net/item/78669](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/78669)\n\nThe link above is to my first ever grail! She's apparently an older figure and her aftermarket has tripled since her release. There's two versions to her, the other with different colored hair and she is wielding a sword instead of multiple knives. I would have preferred that one in all honesty but I still love this version and I'll take all that I can get! I finally found a listing for her on Buyee and although the shipping was atrocious I'm happy that I got her!\n\nI can DM you my MFC list if you're curious in seeing. (: Up to you!",

Not sure if it's helpful to you or good advice but what makes it easier for me in keeping ckeck of the track of time or Preorders and other purchases is writing them all on a list, like I make a list for every month where I write down how much money I receive from my paycheck, how much bills (electric, Dad, drivers license, Grandma etc.) i have to pay, which Preorders I have for this month and how much money I have left at the end of the Month to either save or spent on other things.\n\nNever played shining hearts so I can't say a lot about her but from what I can tell she's incredibly beautiful both in sculpt and design so I get why she's your grail. I'm happy for you that you managed to snatch her even if it maybe wasn't the form you wanted or getting her was a struggle but the way it looks like, even if the shipping price was astroucious having the patience to continue looking for her was more than worth it! \n\nAs for figures...the only grail I own is the Riddle Rosehearts Scale Figure from Aniplex, he's also not the newest figure on the market and since he was a limited release (never to be re-released) his market price was understandably horrendous...though I was lucky to get him for around 80\u20ac, instead of 300\u20ac, due to his Box being damaged (right when I tried assembling him I accidentally ended up breaking his little finger but it's all good! I was able to fix it and I don't intend of ever selling him soo,-)\n\nMy grail: https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1019554\n\nConvention Prize Figure: https://myfigurecollection.net/item/266283 \nI just noticed that she was released in 2015 not 2013, so...yeah I definetly can't keep track of time either, have to correct myself than seems like the Convention was in 2015 not 2013, my bad ^^\"\n\nFirst ever Figure bought from my own money: \nhttps://myfigurecollection.net/item/998277\n\nSure!

I don't change the faceplate of my Hawks Scale because even though it came with two faceplates I prefer the \"standard\" faceplate over the bonus, there's not a huge difference one is \"bored and tired with a frown\" and the other is \"bored and tired with a slight grin\" \n\nMy brother seems to really like the Sukuna Figure because depending on his arm and faceplate he can look calm one minute and pissed the next,- and I'm sitting here unable to decide which faceplate to display on Barbara it's sooo harrrd! Argh!\n\nSo yeah, I totally get almost wanting a second figure inorder to display both faceplates, probably wouldn't be an issue if we had infinite space and money lol",

Meine Oma w\u00fcrde mich umbringen wenn ich es versuche, musste ihr versprechen das die Boxen von Nendoroid/Look up und Prize Figuren sofort weg werfe, die von teuren Figuren darf ich aufbewahren, aber nur wenn das plastik entfernt und sie gefaltet werden.\n\nHab mit meiner Mangasammlung vor ca. 3 Jahren so richtig angefangen also ist das nicht wirklich vergleichbar sch\u00e4tze ich, hab aber trotzdem noch nicht soo viele (mein plan ist eine Mini Bibliothek zu besitzen), wenn mir eine Serie aber wirklich gef\u00e4llt und noch nicht so viele B\u00e4nde auf deutsch oder englisch erschienen sind kanns auch sein das ich sie online weiterlese.\n\nGlaub ein wirkliches \"fr\u00fch\" oder \"sp\u00e4t\" gibt's im sammeln nicht, au\u00dfer es geht um Serien die schon l\u00e4ngst au\u00dfer Druck sind oder limitierte Ausgaben. Solangs einem Spa\u00df macht und das Geld nicht einfach so wahllos aus dem Fenster schmei\u00dft, ist es doch egal wann man anf\u00e4ngt oder wie gro\u00df die eigene Sammlung ist...vor allem weil Anime Figuren und Manga schei\u00dfe teuer werden k\u00f6nnen",

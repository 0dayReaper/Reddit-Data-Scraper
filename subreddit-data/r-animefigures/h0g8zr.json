(Because in many ways it is exceedingly non-Miku.)  Even some [cool Luka](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/72522) still comes across odd with the translucent hair hijinks.\n\nThere is one [vocaloid set](https://myfigurecollection.net/browse.v4.php?version=Hanairogoromo) I've always been pretty interested in, though.",

It would be a different story if all the other million Miku figures not in game are put in as modules.\n\nI would be ecstatic for a Honey Whip (Sweet Devil) or the Emerald module as a scale figure! GSC already answered one of my favorites, My Dear Bunny Miku! These three are my favorite modules, I hope the other two become scale figures too.",

    "postText": "I was thinking of getting the new Makise Kurisu pop up parade from  The Good Smile Company, but the 16 buck shipping is really turning me off. Should I just wait and see if my local anime store gets on in or is they're a discount going code going around because if I can get it down to like 5 bucks, it will be worth the shipping. As my local anime store doesn't sell  them that  much higher then Good Smile.",

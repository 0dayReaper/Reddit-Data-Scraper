Personally, I love mine, though I prefer her Aniplex Kimono ver bc I love her pose and the traditional kimono design more [https://myfigurecollection.net/item/394712](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/394712).\n\nThis Alter one has more white in colours though, which mean she blend wells with other white Saber figures and Saber Lily if display them on the same shelves.\n\nDoes it say what condition it is in? I think the tag says 17000 yen, that's not a bad price for pre-owned in nice condition. As other said, she is fairly common on the 2nd hand market, so you can definitely take your time with this. Amiami currently has a few of her in B+ or A condition [https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=FIGURE-039697-R](https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=FIGURE-039697-R) for 19000 yen+",

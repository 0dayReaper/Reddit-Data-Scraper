    "postText": "Does second Hand entail that it has been opened and would it also entail that it was never opened but was bought by a previous consumer? I guess the question is what aspects would constitute second Hand. I recently saw one, doesn't state any type of damage and appears to be new. Though all it says on the tag is second hand.",

Second hand *could* entail unopened and new, but if there\u2019s no damage stated then it\u2019s likely the box and figure are new/like new and it\u2019s fine. If someone used to own it then it\u2019s realistically second hand regardless of the usage. I\u2019ve never had any issue with second hand figures with no damage stated.",

            "comment": "Doesn't necessarily mean that it has opened. You can probably interpret it as, anything that is sold to the shop by the customer can be classified as second hand, regardless of condition. So yes, even brand new unopened boxes will be listed as second hand.\n\nUsually some shops will add additional labels indicating additional information regarding conditions (if it didn't, then use your best judgement by visually inspecting it).\n\nSome examples of labels that second hand shop may include:\n\u958b\u5c01\u6e08\u307f - previously opened\n\u672a\u958b\u5c01 - not opened\n---\u30ad\u30ba/---\u30c0\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8 - something is damaged\n\u8272\u79fb\u308a - paint transfer",

I remember the life-sized Rem from a few years ago was over 10k USD.\n\nAs for the size, based on [this video](https://twitter.com/ma_ki_ne_vvv/status/1505002517574615041?s=21) the base puts her head above the average person. Maybe another head taller than average. That\u2019s not even taking into account her trident.",

I think this one is going to be more than the good ol' Rem scale tbh based on the posing and base alone",

    "postText": "I was wondering this might be a weird question considering it's a figures subreddit. But I think removing those plastic windows or designs in boxes and giving an ordinary box would help lower the cost while keeping it sealed. Granted it would destroy the whole \"unboxing experience\" but wouldn't the figurine matter more than the box. What's your thoughts with regards to the figurine box, would you want it as bland as possible as long as the figurine shows up safe? (If not and you would want a cool looking box what figurine boxes do you like, any examples?)",

Prizes and nendos are the exceptions.\n\nAside from that, the only thing that annoys me are these companies making massive boxes when they don't need to. Max Factory's palm sized Anya was a great example.",

As for boxes as long as it's proportional to the size of the figurine unlike the max factory Anya one then it's all good?",

For marketing. And B.) To make it harder to make bootlegs.

I'd be surprised if a box costs much more than a dollar to make. Do I care? Not really, box brings figure, figure goes out of box, box gets stored somewhere. But if we're talking saving like $1 I'd still take the printed one.\n\nOtherwise I'm with the top comment, unnecessarily gigantic boxes are a fucking pita. If I have to store them in stupid ways they at least can look nice I guess (e.g. I have the [symphony miku box](https://myfigurecollection.net/pictures.php?itemId=1049502&amp;categoryId=8) on top of a shelf because it wouldn't fit anywhere else and it is a pretty box).",

For me, I keep boxes for scales and nendos/figmas, whereas prizes are recycled. However in the event where I order a figure and their box came damaged, I honestly wouldn't care because as long as the figure isn't affected, that's whats important",

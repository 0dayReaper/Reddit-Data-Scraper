    "postText": "My Tsuruno lost a ribbon and I don't think it will ever be found. I will try writing to the manufacture for a replacement part but I doubt they will provide that. I build gunpla for some years so I am confidence that I can craft something, and I just need some information to get started. Does anyone have experience or guidance how to DIY lost figure parts like that? Thank you in advance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qwinx5tjct4b1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c8fefaf42ef66a97c30feec23e16c622f80d4ca8",

You'd probably need to spend quite some time on a smooth surface finish and painting.\n\nYou could look for some small doll accessories and modify them to work.",

Should I also go to an art gallery and tell the artists that their work is actually worth ____? Ask any non-figure collector how much any of it costs and they'll lowball you. \n\nNo, the scales I get are head and shoulders above prizes. Shading on a prize doesn't compare, and the heft of them really shows the savings.\n\nIf your prerogative is to have as many figures as you can, for the cheapest amount possible, good on you. It's your collection, you do what you want.\n\n&gt;How are they higher value if the are 5 times the price and sometimes more than that\n\nBecause price isn't the only level of value to a figure. My value for them comes from quality + price. A prize/PUP can have good value for money, but I don't want them on my shelves. I have yet to find a prize that I've seen and thought: \"Wow, I would rather have this than a scale version of the same thing\". If you can point me at one that is better than the scale in the same type of pose + outfit, nows your chance to make me eat my words.\n\nMy collection's value isn't monetary. It's how good they look. Most of my figures bat above their price tag compared to others, some are overpriced. But I know what I'd be getting for a prize level of the same thing, and I wouldn't make that sacrifice for any of them.",

That is not to say about all of them of course. There are some crazy good scales as there are some crazy good prizes. \n\nAnd I think it's great. Collecting nowadays is such an inclusive hobby because of that. You don't have to spend few thousand dollars to have a beautiful collection. If you buy that you like by the fraction of that price you can build something you will love.\n\nAnd from that I heard some scales can be also downgraded after the production period? At least from comments here. My only scales are older models so I knew exactly how they looked irl so these are just rumors for me.",

Its easy to see some companies just jack up price simply because they can. *(of course we can't compare with scale that are properly detailed and painted, what are people even thinking?)*\n\nStill on the fence about Mai AMP+, i already have one Mai figure but not bunny suit. The net looks a bit off to me so I'm unsure. But going to see if the store I use will have stock or not, it will fly off the shelve insanely fast for sure.

They might lack details compared to scales, but some of them are great values and have interesting pose.\n\nIs still a bit of a hit and miss though in terms quality. I have good experience with Taito,  Ichiban Kuji, and Sega SPM prize figures, but you can get unlucky and get one with poor paint job. Luckily, only happened to me a few times so far.\n\nUnless you live in Japan or somewhere where you can actually win them as a prize figure or in crane game, what's stopping me from getting one a lot of time is the shipping cost though, you still pay almost as much to ship them compared to scales unless you bundle them in shipping. When shipping costs more than the figure itself, you start to wonder whether is worth it.",

But I don't think anyone could really say when they will be available for preorder or released, other than guessing. You could [go and check Apex's past figures](https://myfigurecollection.net/browse.v4.php?orEntries%5B%5D=199521&amp;rootId=0) to see how much time was between when they were added to the database (which is effectively same as the announcement date) and their release date. However as it seems there isn't too many figures from them that were already released. MyFigureCollection doesn't keep track of preorder start dates either, so you need to check those elsewhere. It seems [HobbySearch](https://www.1999.co.jp) has this info on the product pages. If you start from MyFigureCollection, then it's quickest if you search on HobbySearch with the JAN code that is visible on the MFC item pages.",

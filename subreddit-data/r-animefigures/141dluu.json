    "postText": "Most retailers I see only provide height information and it's kind of annoying that they don't add the full measurement details within the specifications. Like yeah, I get it, they're usually standing up so most people would only be concerned with height. I still think it's important to include full 3D measurements since some figures out there can have quite a bit of length or width and not just height. \n\nI'm the kind of person that likes to use all the space available when posing figures together, so space limitations can make it difficult to discern if a figure is the right enough dimensions to fit in a particular spot. There's no reason why providing full measurement details shouldn't be the norm for all figures.  \n\n\nIf anyone knows a website that details all the specs of a figure, I'd love to know about it.",

            "comment": "It would be nice if they'd do that; I appreciate more information for more informed decisions. However, I also see why they don't because that makes them liable for false advertising (as stupid as that is). I know resin statues provide length, height, and depth, but they come with a big disclaimer that it's a pre-estimate and they, along with PVC figures, do tend to be off. (I know because I'm that nerd that puts a ruler to everything because I like to record the \"true scale.\")\n\nEdit: spelling",

Take a ruler and measure:\n   1. height and witdth on the \"front\" pic,\n   2. height and length on the \"side\" pic.\n3. Make proportions:\n   1. pic height (front) / real height = pic width / real width\n   2. pic height (side) / real height = pic length / real length\n4. Solve for \"real width\" and \"real length\"\n5. ????\n6. PROFIT!\n\nIt is not 100% reliable, since official pictures might be at an angle so it might scew results a bit, but it will give you a general idea of the sizes.\n\nAs the other person mentioned, you can replace \"ruler\" with \"pixel measurement\". ;p",

When it comes to the Nier series I love so many even if there are quite a few bad ones going around, some stand out ones are Prime1 studios new 1/3 scale 2B, Creation studios 1/4 A2 and Creation studios 1/4 Zero. Flare also nailed 2B and v2 on the way looks stunning, tho I am super biased because I love the Nier series beyond lol",

Its pretty crazy how far they have come. The amount of characters they have released over the years is also incredible. It's a travesty they haven't made a Buggy or Magellan yet though. \n\nAnd if POPs are too expensive there are many One Piece prize figures that are fantastic. If POPs aren't complex enough, you can even collect large licensed resin statues from Jimei Palace and Tsume. The franchise produces figures for all budgets.",

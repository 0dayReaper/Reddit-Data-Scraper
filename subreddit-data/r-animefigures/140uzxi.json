    "postText": "The boy and his box have been in storage for years and I recently rescued him from my family home. The blister packaging was yellowed. The clear plastic window was already pushed in when I received him originally. The stains look like water damage and I'm assuming it's from humidity leaking through the box. How can I go about cleaning this? I already tried wiping it away. So it's something more stubborn. TIA",

            "comment": "Usually the best way is to work your way up in cleaners by how harsh they are. Dish soap in warm water with a cloth will clean up most surface level gunk. If that fails, try testing a small spot with alcohol on a cotton swab. If that likewise doesn't work, a magic eraser (or more specifically melamine foam) should remove it (though not without risk, see below).\n\nBe aware that alcohol can remove paint from the surface, so use it sparingly. And a magic eraser is an abrasive, so you are basically sanding off the surface. This can ruin the paints finish and remove sealer, so it is basically a last resort when otherwise the figure looks like crap.",

For hay, perhaps there is a less \"dusty\" alternative; I know my friend who has a rabbit doesn't have much hay. You can also use a room air purifier to keep down particulate.\n\nFor 2, having a case that is mostly/fully enclosed keeps stuff in the air off figures. It also keeps pets from damaging figures directly.\n\nFor 3, an electric air duster (basically a battery, a fan, and a nozzle) helps make cleaning less of a hassle with a larger collection. Otherwise, a makeup brush does a good job mechanically cleaning.",

Some of the paint used is EXTREMELY soft and you will want to avoid heavy abrasion. \n\nUse 70-80% Isopropyl and cotton balls and very gently rub until clean.\n\nWorst comes to worst you can always repaint the hair since it's just a flat white.

When plastics are injection molded (like most figures), the manufacturer adds plasticizer to make the plastic more flexible so it is easier to form. Very simply, the plasticizer slowly migrates to the surface and vaporizes. However, if it is in a sealed box, it can build up and prevent more from vaporizing. It largely isn't a problem though, and can be removed with warm water and dish soap.",

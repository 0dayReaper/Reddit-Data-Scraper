I'm going to buy a clamshell suitcase whilst here in Japan and Idk what size I need \n\nThe other figures I've bought I'll take the risk in my soft suitcase but I want Shaohua Miku and Revy 1/4 Bunny to go in the clamshell suitcase. I will be trying to also fit the Gilgamesh 1/8 AlterxAltair figure (if that doesn't get delayed) but wanna go ahead and get an idea for size for the other 2 at least.\n\nAnyways as the title says can someone give me the dimensions LxWxH of the Shaohua Miku 1/7 Myethos and Revy FREEing 1/4 Bunny figures?",

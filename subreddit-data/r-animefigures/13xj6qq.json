Currently have the Re:Zero Rem and Ram fluffy hoodie/parka figures, and have the Re:Zero Rem/Ram grey cat (?) Hoodie figures on order. I'd like to stay in the same scale/prize figure price range. If anyone has any ideas, or suggestions I'd love to hear them..especially a cute Miku in a hoodie would be awesome.",

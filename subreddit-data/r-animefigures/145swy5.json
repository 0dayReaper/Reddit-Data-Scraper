For reference, most of not all of them are peg-insert on their feet. Thanks a bunch!",

Just put those original bases at the back of the shelve as backdrop or something. Display a couple figures with actually interesting base normally as center pieces; the rest with plain / boring bases just plop it on your custom board instead.",

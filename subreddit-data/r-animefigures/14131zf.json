I am planning to pre-order this (NSFW, just in case) [figure](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1820510), and I was curious, how fast do I have to be about it? I just don't want to be too late when the pre-orders open.",

This is Hobby Stock, so it'll have a long preorder period. And possibly some stock available on release. I seem to recall one of their other nurse figures there was some stock sloshing around for a little while.",

Speaking of which, I actually did some digging around and another figure from this same series is still open for pre-orders (she has been open for pre-orders since March) and they are supposed to be releasing in September, so I guess I worried for no reason.",

Check websites for new figures everyday and search the figures JAN code for any site which lists it for Pre-order would include its JAN code.\n\nSites usually take it off Pre-order just before they cannot order any more from their supplier since they would have unfulfilled or unknown availability for orders.",

    "postText": "Since my move I finally had the chance to take proper pictures of my Megami Device 2/1 scale of Ninja Asra. I decided to display her up rather than laying down for visibility,, she\u2019s huge and has some weight! Super easy to put together but has multiple small pieces,, hopefully you enjoy the images as much as I do! Can\u2019t wait for Archer to arrive, just paid shipping.",

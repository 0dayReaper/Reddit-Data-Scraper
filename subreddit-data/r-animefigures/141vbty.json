    "postText": "I try to pay full price when there is a 25% bonus and then use the rare 10% coupon and TOM points on stuff that has only a 5% TOM point return.  But I am finding it increasingly difficult to find figures to fit those criteria and also burn enough points cause of the 50% limit.\n\nI may just start counting a 25% TOM points item as 18.75% in my head now cause when you go spend those points, if it is on a 25% back item, you don\u2019t earn points on the amount you spend with TOM points.  Or 12.75% if you are used to settling for 15% TOM point orders which I do often too.",

Since she was already over $150 I got free shipping on her even with that massive box. Not to mention the cash back on a big ticket item like that is pretty reasonable.\nSomething else that I should mention is that I buy off of TOM enough to justify being a member which has a few perks including a few member exclusive coupons and extra discounts and cash back.",

Even with free shipping, I\u2019m often worried of overpaying when I see figures $100-$150 cheaper elsewhere but with surface shipping.",

Maybe because I\u2019m focused on certain figures. In my case: Altria Pendragon\u2019s Figma is $200 on TOM whilst in AmiAmi it\u2019s $125. I have $75 points saved up on TOM, so even if I got free shipping, I can\u2019t justify using all $75 for a very very tiny discount :/",

If you want something to put in your desk or something you can search for desk organizers (they have ones that can hold books). You can even do floating shelves\n\nThere are tons of alternative display options but I'm not sure what exactly you're looking for",

                    "comment": "Just wanted to warn you that gluing acrylic is very finicky. You would need a welding glue, which has to be the more expensive water-thin solvent cement, because trying to weld perpendicular connections with the thicker solvents ends up looking very bad due to the glue being pushed out of the connection, creating smears and blobs of glue on the edges (and you can't wipe those off quickly, because the bond immediatelly starts fusing with the surface, so it does not come off unless sanded and polished again), and it's also very hard co create and hold 90 degrees angle for hours, unless precut to 45 deg. Water thin solvent creates strong connection after just a few seconds, so you just prop it up at the proper angle, apply the fluid solvent in the connection via a syringe-needle, hold it for a few seconds and let go - it will make a bond so it won't fall off anymore, but it will still take several hours to cure.\n\nAll and all, it's not as easy as using a superglue to fix stuff, and the solvent + acrylic are quite expensive. So honestly, buying some cheap acrylic boxes or using something like the picture frames would probably be way cheaper and less frustrating.",

You can select some variety of sizes and the 20x20xY should be able to house most figures unless it's something chonky or bigger than 1/6. It looks good, only two sides have visible connections, so from front you don't see the hooks.\n\nThe only downside is that they are a bit flimsy when putting them together cause they are not tightly secured, more like they fit into each other with some wiggle room. But when you put the lid on, it's really sturdy and won't ever fall apart unless you drop it. If anything, the lid is so tight it's a bit hard to remove afterwards lol.\n\nEdit: [Here a few pictures](https://imgur.com/a/8npEafP)",

    "postText": "Hey, guys, I recently noticed that almost all the white parts of my Asuna figure has turned yellow, and I don't know what's going on. I maintain it very well, the temperature is basically controlled at about 25 degrees Celsius, and there is no sunlight or strong light, but only LED lights. I went on a trip for nearly three months and didn't clean up the dust in time, because I put the figurines on a bookshelf without a door. I don't know if that's what's causing the yellowing.",

If it's a manufacturer defect you can try contacting the figure manufacturer for replacement. State how the figure has significantly deteriorated in a short time.",

Only thing I can think of is that something suspicious went on in your room while you were away like people smoking or cooking really close to your room. (Smoke in general, but especially that of tobacco, can cause yellowing but you\u2019d already have suspected that if there was a bad odor coming from them).",

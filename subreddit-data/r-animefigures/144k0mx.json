Paid another figure at the end of February, but with regular surface instead. The regular figure arrived exactly 2 months from shipped date while the premium still hasn't even reached AmiAmi's US warehouse/distributor. Just a week ago, I got 2 more packages via regular surface that only took 2 months to arrive after the shipping notification.",

After looking it up, looks like Premium is Amiami's own storage unit that they don't ship till its full.  And regular is JPN's own shipping service.  Looks like an overlap from when they were trying to make sense of covid shipping.",

I hate it. But I've never lost anything. They always show up eventually. I only do it when other options are through the roof. I had an order with two 1/4 scales that was going to cost $180. Only $60 for surface. So, I went with the savings. Another example was a $10 mouse pad I really wanted and was only available from one store. Express shipping was like $50. Surface was $20. Didn't want to pay $70 for a mouse pad ($30 was bad enough T-T).",

So I keep all my collection fairly well-contained inside a cabinet and the boxes in a closet. Other than that, it's interesting to hear his thoughts on which ones he likes.\n\nAlthough he doesn't like to accumulate objects generally, he saw one figure he liked enough to want, so I got him his first figure that should arrive this summer.",

            "comment": "My boyfriend is such a sweetie. He himself likes watching anime so didn\u2019t find my interest unfounded, and when we began dating I immediately told and showed him my special interest. He is a bit protective you could say in terms of me viewing NSFW content. I\u2019d think if I had an interest in collecting male figures that had their dicks out, it would be a problem, but since it\u2019s women he\u2019s more lax. (Maybe secretly he enjoys seeing them too? Lol.)\n\nFor me though, my oshi is Sonico and I own a lot of her NSFW figures. Instead of shaming me for it he finds the interest itself very charming and always buys me gifts in the forms of anime figures (and of course, I buy him figures as a present back!) For my birthday last year he got me Super Sonico\u2019s After Party figure that has a separate nude breastplate. He\u2019s also seen my collection and the amount of money I\u2019ve spent on it, and he even watched Animeplz123 since I started dating him so that he can get more into the hobby for my sake.\n\nAlso somehow, I got him into My Little Pony since we\u2019ve begun dating and for his birthday this year I got him a new and sealed Fluttershy bishoujo figure!",

Either characters I really like, or I just find the figures to be cute or interesting. I got a few figures of characters we both like and have 2 bunny figures ( I don't have enough space to put my Lacus Clyne one out yet) he doesn't care that I collect them since they make me happy. He is mostly upset that I've taken over his Gundam space, lol. He builds the models himself. He is the one who got me into anime in the first place, so he can only blame himself \ud83e\udd23. It all started with a few Kobato Hasegawa figures and grew from there. I also have her stuffed rabbit and a stuffed version of Anyas chimera.",

We have been together 9 years and over that time I have gotten more into the hobby on both the anime side and other statues. As I have gotten more into it she started buying my figures for our anniversary or my birthday or Christmas which has increased my collection by a lot. We always joke about it because 90% of the time it's a pre-order so my gifts for things come at random times throughout the year or even the next year. I almost always remember what holiday she bought it for and when they come I always thank her for my [insert holiday] present lol. She forgets 90% of the time and is like, is that what I got you for Christmas? She watches maybe half or more of the anime shows I love and is a crafting/art person so she appreciates them for their artistic value even when she doesn't know the show. It's honestly great to have a partner who supports your hobbies and even encourages them.",

However, most of the ones I have bought are for my partner.\n\nHe went through a long time where he couldn't afford necessities. Let alone fun stuff. So I occasionally buy him figs of his favorite video game and anime characters, and he displays them around the apartment. Not too many, just a saitama (a prize figure, I think? Never been clear on the difference between that and scale. It's [this](https://www.amazon.com/Banpresto-Punch-DXF-Premium-Figure-Saitama-Multicolor/dp/B07LBQ3HLH/) one), and a solid snake figma ([this](https://www.amazon.com/Max-Factory-Metal-Gear-Solid/dp/B00P1X44C6)).\n\nI tend to like figures that are more anime girls with big boobs. Haven't sprung for any of them but he's said he wouldn't mind having them around and he's cool with the cheesecake posters I have hung up, so I don't anticipate any issues there. Hopefully one day I can get a Lulu fig. There's an official one out there but every time I've looked it up on ebay it's going for ~$300.00 . I can't justify it to myself.",

All in all, my wife is also a nerd, and we go to ColossalCon every year as a family of five.\n\nIt\u2019s not all that much different than my grandparents who collected Hummels, Precious Moments, or Dalton figures, although those figures never had scandalous figures in their ranks.",

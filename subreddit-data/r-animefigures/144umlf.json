It isn\u2019t like the quality, details or quality control from Megahouse blows the competition away to justify this kind of price for how small and somewhat simple kind of figure this Lacus is. \n\nSo while it will look good, and I will probably get it myself, I do feel like she is quite overpriced, like many other Megahouse figures especially as of late.",

They shipped yesterday but already arrived\ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude32 Got em both both as secondhand but tbh the seal sticker looked untouched!\n\nSaber 10th Royal Dress 1/7th scale\nThe original 2015 version soo yeh there was a bit of that sticky residue on it but nothing a little soap soak hopefully won't fix &gt;&lt; If this specific figure I shouldn't do that with pls lmk wouldn't wanna mess it up &gt;&lt; Love saber so I definitely needed a figure of her!! And the dress is soo pretty and hefty, wow!! I need to get a good Salter too but I saw kadokawa is planning a lingerie version so might get that one (depending on design) since the other one's aren't vibing enough that much with me, but if anyone has prepainted Salter recs lmk! I prefer ones that aren't just the standard character design, gimme some spice in design or clothing etc :))\n\nAsuna Roomwear 1/7th scale\nGot the version with the PO acrylic stand! I love her! A blend of cute but sexy but leans more to the cute side \ud83e\udd70 Personally I like the facial expressions of the alternate one (open mouth) better! And I love the base being fabricish styled to give a more cozy look! Wanna get the Asuna Negligee kadokawa scale figure as well! Debating whether I should get it on release (this month!) or wait it out (Only bc I might buy Shaohua Miku instead \ud83d\ude06 since im Miku shipping would kill compared to the Asuna). SAO is one of my fav shows and lucky since it's pretty popular I'm spoiled for choice with the figures! (other than my poor Eugeo only 1 scale but at least he has one at all &gt;&lt;) Suuper glad to have her in my collection!",

Not to mention her attire just looks so cozy. Such good choices here, you obviously have good taste. :)\n\nAnd wow that is crazy fast arrival, so far my record is just over 5 days.\n\nWelcome to the figure collecting club (something I just got into myself funnily enough), I will wish your wallet all the strength in the world lol!",

They did take like 4 days after I paid to ship it out too soo I'm not counting that processing time either. Apparently they used Sagawa express which is overnight delivery so that might just be the norm for Amiami domestic japan shipments or maybe they have a spending threshold for that?? The order was just over 20k yen with the 630 shipping cost \ud83e\udd14",

Yeah I'm in the same boat, I am already running out of room from other nick knacks so I don't think I'll be able to purchase more than a dozen figures before I'm totally out of room. My desk is cluttered enough as it is. lol (It's an organized mess. X3)\n\nI live in British Columbia Canada near the coast so honestly Japan is only a hop, skip, and a jump away. I had also ordered her by seamail so I was super lucky she wasn't stuck on the docks for as long as the first figure I had ordered (who arrived second), who ended up spending 2 months in transit. What's really nice though is once they arrive in my country I'm like \"yes!\" because I know it's going to be at my door step within the next few days, excluding weekends. :)\n\nWhat's nice about yen is that it's so easy to calculate into Canadian dollars, I just have to remove the two final numbers in my head and it's 99% accurate.\n\nShe was my second figure but ended up arriving first: [https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1440488](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1440488)\n\nShe was my first ever order but took a while to get here: [https://myfigurecollection.net/item/118061](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/118061)\n\nAnd she is now on her way! [https://myfigurecollection.net/item/78669](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/78669)\n\nI adore them all so much, ahhh!",

The world of merch in Japan is vastt. Shining hearts I remember from the anime but I think it was from a VN?? (idr if it was eroge or not tho). My fav character was Kaguya ofc \ud83d\ude06",

X3\n\nBut yeah around 99% of my wishlisted items on my MFC page are either OC's or are from anime I've never seen yet, like you said there's just so much lovely merch!!\n\nMy favorite character so far is Holo from Spice &amp; Wolf. :)\n\nEdit: Ohhh visual novel, that's what you meant by VN!",

I really like the OTs-14 Groza Freeing figure even though I've never played Girls Frontline and the Sleeping Beuaty Figure from Myethos is gorgeousss\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b but between anime and manga and figures... welp I definitely don't have enough for all that ahaha... plus shelf space is precious so I try to be really picky and just stick to vicariously enjoying everything else too\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f",

Yeah I had a friend some years back who was into an action/adventure fantasy style anime that for the majority of it was really wholesome but like the second final episode had a really awkward scene that would almost belong in a hentai and I remember him texting me freaking out haha I forgot the name of it, but it always catches you off guard when a show switches genre (either for a scene or from then on going forward) like half-way through or nearly at the very end haha.\n\nThat's a wise policy, perhaps one I should adopt eventually haha. If you're curious on my must-have list I could send over my MFC list or something, up to you. X3 But yeah I'm definitely putting up some limits, like no 1/4 or 1/5 scales and no more figures with large bases. I just don't have the room. XD I'm also trying to stick to a few specific themes so I don't end up with a hodge podge of random merch.",

If i get one it'll probably be Fate or Miku since idc about bunnies lol but a lot of the Fate ones are pretty standard character design (I want like special clothing design or smthg not just basic Saber \ud83d\ude02) but ig the point is it's 1/4 size. Haven't looked into Miku much but I really only want one or two of her bc that's a whole other hole I could fall into lol Looking at Shaohua Miku rn from Myethos\n\nsure sure I enjoy seeing other peeps collections :)) \n\nhere's [mine](https://myfigurecollection.net/profile/ONSK/collection/) too if u wanna take a look :)) I would put it in my flair but I haven't quite figured out how to change it to my exact link \ud83d\ude05\n\nYou'll see I'm a huge fan of Oshi no Ko... for sure I'm guilty of that random merch hodge podge for the series \ud83d\ude06 Doesn't help I'm in Japan where accessibility to merch is the best u can get right when it's airing",

I am planning on getting the 1/4 Holo later on this year. :) But anything about 12 inches in height is a no-go for me, so Holo doesn't count for in that figure she's on her hands and knees. lol\n\nOh I am definitely 100% avoiding Miku because I know what's going to happen if I even buy 1 figure of her, that's not a rabbit hole, that's a rocket that's going past the solar system lol\n\nOooo cool!

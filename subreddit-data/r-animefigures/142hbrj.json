I got into the figure game a bit late and I had seen this figure of [Rory](https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=FIGURE-143702) that released in 2018.\n\nI wanted her so bad but was not willing to pay the $400+ CAD aftermarket. I resigned myself to never owning it and then it came back up for pre-order recently and was so happy to see it listed for 7600yen less than the original.",

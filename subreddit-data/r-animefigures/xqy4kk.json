Look at how variable the Nendoroid line's pricing can be, and that's generally due to licensing costs differing a ton from one property to the next. \n\nBy setting a fixed price that means for stuff where the licensing fee is higher, there's less margin. Got to make that profit margin back up somewhere and they do it by squeezing the quality.",

If you look at the strand of hair on the fringe to the furthest right as an easy example. The physical piece itself doesnt stick out as far on the model on the right. If its a bad paint job thickness of paint would be additive not subtractive. Thats a difference on the model itself not the paint job. \n\nMost likely scenario to me is just shittier mold quality of cheaper plastics that doesnt flow into details as well",

The promo figure is lit with a frontal spotlight and a diffuse light, plus using less glossy paint, so the contrast between shadowed and lit areas is larger. Look how much harder the shadow is on her nose and left cheek line in the promo, and the way the center of her face is much more brightly lit. This also has the effect of brightening the white of her teeth. The shot on the right is not the same angle either, it's taken from a little bit higher.\n\nThere might be *some* reduction of the very fine details in the sculpt but it's the same sculpt, the reason the details look blurred out is primarily due to shitty quality paint (i.e. thicker layers applied less carefully than a orototype would be) and lighting. And probably lower quality plastic.\n\nBut it will have been the same sculpt, because AFAIK PuP figures are 3D modeled on a computer and the molds are created straight from the model. That allows them to produce them much faster and more cheaply than they do with scales that demand more detail and QC.\n\nEDIT: By the way, not arguing this isn't a disappointingly badly made figure - it is not good at all. Just not sure that this is a different sculpt, I think it's just the result of mass production at a low price point vs a prototype.",

Nah bro its straight up shorter where i pointed out, no angle shit about it. \n\nI aint saying its a different sculpt im saying the physical model is different due to casting quality. Heres a list of cost saving measures that could alter the physical model without changing the master sculpt at all.\n\n- shittier mold that hasnt been adequately quality controlled.\n- shittier plastic that either isnt as liquid and flowy when injected, or doesnt retain shape as well\n- not allowing the plastics to properly cool before popping out the mold, so the plastic still has elasticity and warps as it cools. \n\nSame master sculpt, shittier product",

Most I've seen range between 3,900 yen to 4,800 yen.)\n\n^(Here's another food for thought, anyone ever noticed the boxes vary amongst them?)\n\nBut before yen got dirt cheap, prices in GSC US varied between $38.99 to $43.99 to $49.99 (which you can guess who was this price), Now I'm seeing a bunch of $31.99 to $35.99. You can still see they trying price the older releases at $38.99 but newer releases and PO are around $31.99\n\n[https://www.goodsmileus.com/category/figures-67/pop-up-parade?page=1](https://www.goodsmileus.com/category/figures-67/pop-up-parade?page=1)",

Heard smack on the GSC exclusive himiko toga but funnily enough mine was much better looking and currently all of my hero academia PuP came as expected (ochaco and Tsuyu)\n\nI can't talk smack about eren titan form as I do not have that but I heard it was really bad and this release is 2021.\n\nThe first ever release miku came perfect as well as Kizuna ai and those were both in 2019.\n\nAs for prices, I feel you if you're using yen in GSC Global or GSC JP. Here in GSC US, it's somehow cheaper, never have I seen a [$25.99 PuP.](https://www.goodsmileus.com/product/pop-up-parade-anya-forger-9251) \n\nThis is concerning and an abomination, even with my yui kotegawa pup is definingly off, it's not bad as this.

Scratches on the paint, chips coming off it, parts not fitting together well like Sesshomaru's big scarf thing. I understand they are cheaper figures but when even my crane game prize level figures have better QC its not a great look.   \n\n\nLuckily they look okay from a distance on my shelf so im not totally dissatisfied but still. Probably my last PUP figure. Its a shame Inuyasha doesn't have many other options for quality figures unless you get into the really high end resins.",

Looks like a poor quality prize figure. Or a poor imitation Pop Up Fake from one of those Chinese figures without box, or aliexpress stuff. I have no source of this one but I'm willing to bet it's a fake.\n\n\n(PS: there are lots of wholesome prize figures out there, even though they are cheap, they are pretty neat and when it comes to finesse on the painting, sometimes it ain't that different from a 1/6 - 1/8 scale figure. So don't let a bad figure misguide you from the wholesome ones!)\n\n\n\nAlso let's be honest, some figures produced/in the making during the years late 2019-2022 have had some serious quality issues regarding the paint and the like on the finishing product.\n\n\nWe have had bad a few bad years recently. Figure releases have been delayed, and i assume during the corona breakdown, they had to minimize personel and the like. \n\n\nAnd I'm not talking about all the figures, but just speaking in general. That was the whole reason why I hesitated with Pip Up Parades. So far I have 3 figures and they are totally wholesome! Facial expressions are on point, hair features as well. Dental... Is what you expect it to be, all white \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02\n\n\nAnd there are only a few paint issues to criticize, which are affordable for their low price.\n\n\nExample, I have Pop Up Parade Natsu Dragneel which I got for \u20ac30 or lesser (pop ups now are \u20ac35).\n\nIt's the exact same copy as the original Natsu Dragneel from GSC and pose from years ago. Even the colors. I recently found the original without box for \u20ac10 with the fire fist and I thought about buying it, but after comparing the pics from the seller with the one I own, it's definitely not worth it. The Pop Up looks better. Not having the fire fist \ud83d\udd25 is a minor issue.\n\n\nBut yea let's hope as the price goes up for Pop Up Figures, that the quality doesn't go down.\n\n\nAlso PS: retail prices here in my country for Erza Scarlet Pop Up Parades went from \u20ac45 to \u20ac55 to \u20ac70 now &gt;.&gt;\n\nWith a shipping option of \u20ac6,49 at the cheapest. Pop Up Parade boxes are very fragile, even though shipping is done the same day, I'm sure it will arrive broken -_-",

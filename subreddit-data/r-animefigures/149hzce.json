I'd consider this a grail for myself, because I've been searching since I started collecting in 2020, but have not been able to find one (that's NOT on ebay).  Instantly added to cart and checked out when I saw her.\n\nWas so excited and fulfilled, I tried to get creative with lighting for a decent showcase.",

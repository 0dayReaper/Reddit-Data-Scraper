Her face kind of remind me of a rare Freeing fig I been trying to find for a good price. One thing to add, is there color variants of this fig? Her hair color obviously doesn't match the postcard in the 5th pic.",

Yes, we're lucky indeed haha\n\nWas it one of a Satellizer el bridget figure you were looking for?\n\nNo, there's no color variation of this fig, the postcard comes from an illustration straight from the visual novel game. It's true that the colour doesn't match, the color in this illustration is much darker than the fig (and even in the VN game itself haha).",

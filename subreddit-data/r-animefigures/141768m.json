    "postText": "I recently started purchasing figures through it and I thought I was getting good deals on (mostly) recent prize figures- along with a GEM Giyuu from Demon Slayer. The international shipping, though, seems like a lot. I don\u2019t know if consolidated shipping will make it somewhat cheaper but it\u2019s more expensive than the figures themselves. \n\nThe GEM figure\u2019s shipping is $70, a lantern Amp+ Sakura miku is around $50, and two prize Ram figures together is $40. \n\nIs Buyee worth using when the shipping is this high? It seems like ordering from a domestic store would be less expensive, no?",

If you read around the sub you will notice so many people are having issues with their exorbitant shipping fees. \n\nSo far buyee had done the following to get market share:\n\n(A)Get influencers to promote their services\n\n(B) Getting exclusive deals with JP Yahoo Auction, Mercari JP etc to promote their service. Up until a few months ago, Mercari refused to work with any other proxies but buyee. Luckily the exclusive deals seem to be over already as FJ can now buy from Mercari. Those ads made it seem like buyee is the \"official\" option when it is far from the case. Many other proxies are better and can do the same job fine or better.\n\n\n*****\n\nThe only time I ever use proxy (From Japan) are for rare non-anime figure merch such as exclusive keychains, postcards, mug, soft toys etc that will not shows up in mandarake/AmiAmi ever",

Shipping from Japan can get expensive no matter who you buy from unless they offer flat or discounted rates.",

You can ask for them to dispose of the items if you decide not to ship them but you will still have to pay any outstanding fees (such as domestic shipping, consolidation, late storage, etc) on top of eating whatever cost you already paid for the item. \n\nUnfortunately, this is just one of the risks you take when you order from a proxy. I empathize with how tricky it can be to estimate shipping costs without having the exact dimensions/weight of the item\u2014especially when companies overpack and needlessly inflate the final size like Buyee does. I hope you're able to find a solution to get your items sent out without breaking the bank. Have you considered using surface mail (if it's available for your country)? Yes it's slow, but it would at least be substantially cheaper than any air shipping methods.",

You will have to pay the item costs, domestic shipping and whatever costs already incurred. If you don't want to eat the shipping costs, either ask them for cheapest possible shipping or just cut your losses by asking them to dispose the items.

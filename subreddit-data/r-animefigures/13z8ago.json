And even without the effects their figures cost way more than normal, especially considering the QC issues they have.\n\nOther than that, the typical Insight, B'full, Fots etc. I am sure I don't have to specify the reasons here.\n\nBut reading the prompt to specify something that looks like a knockoff, I would mention some of the PUPs. Like the Zero Two one. They usually look decent, but sometimes look so horrible.",

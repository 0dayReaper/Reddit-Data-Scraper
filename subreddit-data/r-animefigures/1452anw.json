I actually managed to track one down. Just wanted to make sure if it's worth the tag price \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79",

I swear you are paying for that more than Sorey himself, lol!\n\nI know some folks get sticker shock by this figure because the paint job isn't premium as Alter and the pose isn't as dynamic. But to me, because this is the only figure Sorey figure in one of his armatization modes, I had to get it. Very few Tales series get anniversary figures too, so chances of them doing a re-release or a new figure is quite rare.",

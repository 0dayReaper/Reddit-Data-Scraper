    "postText": "So I was looking into this ff7 cloud statuette and I see them on ebay listed as kuji ichiban aka a prize figure the box has an A on it and everything, it ships from Japan. However I also see the same exact figure  just listed as a statuette with a completely different box. This is on ebay, bbts, and Amazon. So my question is do they make different versions of the exact same figure? One for retail and one for lottery? Or are they exactly the same?",

            "comment": "Yeah. It's usually comes down to different packaging and where it can be sold. In general, ichiban kuji and other prize figures, in the literal sense, come in plain white boxes with cardboard padding on the inside and are only available Japan. They will then make a prettier box, sometimes with blister padding, of the same figure, but it can only be sold at retail overseas.\n\ntl;dr, it's the same thing. If it's different, it will be specifically listed as an alternate/special version (which you can research on MFC).",

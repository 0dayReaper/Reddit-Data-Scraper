I had a small defect on a figure from hobbylinkjp and didn't even have to ship it back to get a replacement though it seems you would have to for amiami. Personally I would contact them and get a replacement. They should pay you back for the return shipping.\n\n[https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053031771-I-think-an-item-I-received-is-defective-what-should-I-do-](https://support.amiami.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053031771-I-think-an-item-I-received-is-defective-what-should-I-do-)",

If you go too heavy when you put the pieces together it will seep out and it the surface finishes super glossy, but the hold on that stuff is excellent. Good luck.",

I wouldn\u2019t drill no more than 1/4 inch on either side.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable doing that, then zap-a-gap is legendary for gluing plastic together. It sets really fast though. Practice on some other plastic stuff first. It is thin stuff and tends to get messy.",

However, it's true that there were stories in LN where men really offered Elaina sex, but she turned them down because she's a \"[strong independent woman](https://i.imgur.com/6c0WNde.jpg).\"\n\nAnyway, Elaina is a twisted person with a lot of dark traits and when it comes to money she gets very reckless, so it's quite possible that in some parallel universe she became an elite prostitute haha.",

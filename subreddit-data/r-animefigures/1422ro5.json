    "postText": "The base is really freaking cute and she has an extra pouty face you can swap out! Took 2 pictures cuz my room is really dark but I hope flash vs no flash helped\u2026\n\nShe is very top heavy so she can be a little wobbly\u2014 I had to really push her foot into that pudding for minimal lean while she\u2019s on my shelf. Lots of the parts are also really bendy (like her scarf and ends of her hair) so be careful if you get her!\n\n*rip princess connect I really had fun playing that game\u2014 I didn\u2019t get to preorder Ilya but hopefully they make figures of others soon*",

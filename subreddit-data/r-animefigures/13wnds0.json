Then I order Alter Azur Lane Le Triomphant which has no such warning and surface is 4000.\n\nI can combine like 8 figures in 1 huge box for shipment for amiami surface premium but then I cannot combine the above two figures into a surface premium shipment.\n\nCan anyone with both or one of these figures tell me the box sizes?  I wanna get to the bottom of this.",

It will only ship by itself. Amiami claims it's safer for the figure that way.\n\nBox sizes can be found here (it's missing the 80, 160, 180, and 200 boxes): https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/comments/mudcof/amiamis_dhl_shipping_prices_to_us_based_on_theyre/",

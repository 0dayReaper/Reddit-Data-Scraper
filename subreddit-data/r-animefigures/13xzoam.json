    "postText": "Hello all! So I recently purchased the Rimuru Ultimate Version figure from Exfigure.com. Sadly the base arrived broken. Would Estream/Shibuya Scramble be able to send a replacement? Or would I have to go through the long process of replacing the entire figure through an exchange? Has anyone had a similar situation with this figure or one like it, and how was it resolved?\nThank you!",

            "comment": "I think you have to contact Exfigure and see what they can do. Estream won't send you a replacement, since you did not buy it from them or an official partnered retailer. The broken part looks like it's from loose glue, unless it's just a crack. If it's just from loose glue, it will be much easier to just re-glue the piece back together yourself.",

Super helpful staff, they double boxed the package for me, and sent pictures of the item in hand to confirm they had them available. Shipping was only about 2 weeks, and they always responded to emails fast. Obviously the figure being damaged is out of their control, but they told me they have already reached out to eStream regarding a new base, or if I was to pay a professional to fix it they would cover the cost.",

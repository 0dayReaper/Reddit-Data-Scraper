The main difficulty will be making sure it is strong enough to support itself while it cures. Possible you might need accelerator, [see my post(slight nsfw) about gluing when you can't hold the part in place for long](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimeFigures/comments/l3eed4/small_part_repair/). As mentioned in the post, the main difficulty in curing most of the time for CA glue is water availability. It is normally pulled from the air, but AC and forced-air furnaces reduce indoor humidity. Easiest way I found for figure gluing is to breath on it, since your breath carries a lot of moisture.\n\nIf you do use an accelerator, use a liquid one. I used baking soda because the break was uneven and I was trying to fill space. Even then I used a bit two much on one of the joins. It is imperceptible at a distance, but you can see it in my pictures.\n\nThe brand doesn't really matter for the CA glue. I use very small unbranded tubes of it I got at the hardware store. I also have a gel-type CA glue, but that is bad for when the interface is small (this this case), as it is hard to dispense a very small amount so you end up applying too much.",

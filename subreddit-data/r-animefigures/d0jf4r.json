Space efficient isn\u2019t necessarily true because of stacking. In my apartment I have three shelves and I fit about 120 pops visibly on those three. With nendos or some of the awesome anime figures I see here I would never be able to get representation for all of my favorite content in the way I do with pops. Not that quantity is the point, quality is huge and I totally recognize how much cooler these works of art can be, but I do still like how pops look (in box and out) and I think you can make some cool displays with them too.\n\nNot completely arguing against the points made by OP but I think pops deserve a place in the figurine conversation and in my opinion warrant love too.",

The goal is to make people think that its going to be \"rare\" and therefore valuable and drive up hype for sales. Often the manufacturer made them in much greater quantities than they are letting on and down the line the secondary market will be flooded and they will not have much value. Compare with something that has intrinsic value such as a car because it is useful and took a lot of resources and work to build. In the 90s-00s there was a big comic book boom and collapse because comic book publishers were going wild with \"special editions\" and such. Funko Pops are the same deal, they're only worth the enjoyment you get out of them.",

The best way to understand this is to just compare lines.\n\nRegardless how anyone feels, there are over 550 Funko Pop figures in the Disney line. Not including DX and alternate pathways, GoodSmile lists 18 Nendoroids. GoodSmile also tends to have a lot of incomplete lines and that is just all around frustrating.\n\n* No Princess Peach\n* No Donald, Goofy or Pluto\n* No Ganon/Ganondorf\n* No King Dedede\n* No Protoman, Dr. Wiley, Dr. Light\n* Etc\n\nI get that every line can't have every nobody who ever existed but we get a lot of that are just incomplete. I'd be happy with the three from Windwaker or even if all three games got a Zelda, just like I'd love more diversity in the Kirby line or possibly more love for a wide variety of things. Funko is willing to make most of the characters, pander like crazy and charges at most $25. \n\nNow, I personally wouldn't collect them but I can understand the appeal. Especially for series that won't get affordable figures like Twin Peaks, Daria or countless other series.",

If you're a seller then the best price is usually after they are sold out and people buy out of desperation, but as a collector you'll be lucky if your collection is worth what you paid for it years later.\n\nPops are too mass produced to be worth anything in the future. Some exclusives may be worth something but probably not as much as you'd want. You know what toys end up being worth a lot? The ones kids are actually playing with. There are too many people collecting pops which makes them worth very little in the future. The things that are actually played with that nobody collects are the things that are worth money since they become rare. \n\nIf you want a real life example then look at the first wave of star wars toys compared with the other waves. Once people figured they would appreciate in value they started collecting them and drove down the value. Same thing happened with comic books and almost destroyed the industry.\n\nWhat you have right now with Pops is the same thing that happened with Beanie Babies. A bunch of collectors driving up the prices and then years later nobody wants them.\n\nIn summary, just buy things you actually like. Nendos are nice but I prefer buying the more expensive figures. Funkos are overpriced compared to the competition's quality and reasonable prices (Sega for example)",

Was a good idea to grab multiple copies of characters first appearances (Harley Quinn, Deadpool, X23, Moonknight, Venom, Carnage, etc.).\n I buy things because I like them and want them.\n\nAs a collector I know value trends tend to run in 20-30 year cycles... Its a long game if your willing to play it.. Trying to keep everything pristine... I'm not anymore. It's all a gamble too trying to pick what will come around again.\n\nYou're right when you say \"The ones kids are actually playing with.\" end up being worth a lot.  \nWhen we hit a certain age we try to recapture our youth, we have jobs and we want what we used to have as a child but we don't want something old and played with... We want it as close to brand spanking new as possible and now that we have jobs (some good paying ones) we're willing to pay more.\n \nThe Pop/Beanie Baby comparison really doesn't hold water for me because beanie babies didn't do much.. They didn't even stand, no boxes, nothing... Just collected dust.. But Funko has us by our Pop Culture. I feel they have longevity and yeah I agree the market is becoming overstated, the few first gen pops are holding some value or at least more than the $10 I paid.\n\nNow I'm not saying I'm going to retire on Pops but I like to say I will never own a comic or toy worth 100k but I'm sure I can accumulate 1000 Comics and toys worth 100.\nAt least that's how I look at collecting when it comes to monetary value.\n\nI was just asking because I own about 30-40 Nendos I've bought over the years purely because I liked them and I was just curious if there was a way to check value..

Personally I do nendoroids because with how much I make I can\u2019t justify spending 100-300 bucks on a figurine. Even if I did make more I still rather buy more manga or waste that money on cosmetics in games over figurines priced that high. Plus I just like how nendoroids look.",

And for how clean and polished they are I personally wouldn't call them shit tier, but I agree that the price tag is still too high.\n\nI'll also add that I think it can depend on the character too since I recently ordered Chito and Yuuri from Girls' Last Tour, which are already moe-blob characters.",

Otherwise I think maybe using a wash cloth/rag dry or a bit damp could also work, just be very careful around things that come to a point like the tips of hair, I'd imagine the cloth would get stuck and you could damage the figure.",

I can't say I've ever seen a fig damaged by canned air. I think as long as you go by the instructions on the can it should be alright, the whole don't spray closer than 6in and don't turn the can upside-down or shake it vigorously.\n\n I think doing it as sporadically as dusting (not typically everyday) and the tiny amounts used for joints or other nooks, and the even tinier potential amount of other gasses makes damage pretty unlikely.",

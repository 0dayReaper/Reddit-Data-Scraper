            "comment": "I was looking at this over on F4F's site, I own their 1/4 Faye statue which i Love, but this is  too overpriced imo. Sure its resin, but its a simple static pose 1/8 figure. The base is some odd pedestal to make it seem like there's more to it than there actually is. Look at the design of it. Its angular slabs of black plastic that for some reason lift her up a few inches for no reason, its hillarious. They couldnt even be bothered to give us a diorama base to do that job.\n\nYou can literally buy the 1/4 Faye which is still in stock and heavily discounted in many placessuch as BBTS for 40 dollars more with 4 dollars shipping. After shipping you would probably be paying literally the same or more for this 1/8 scale.\n\n[https://www.bigbadtoystore.com/product/variationdetails/130378?utm\\_source=google&amp;utm\\_medium=opla&amp;utm\\_term=CB-130378](https://www.bigbadtoystore.com/product/variationdetails/130378?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=opla&amp;utm_term=CB-130378)\n\nNot sure why F4F has a stranglehold on the license for Bebop and not many other companies get to make stuff but hopefully that changes soon considering the show clearly has the ability to sell esp to Westerners who grow up on toonami.",

            "comment": "There's a misconception that resin is incredibly delicate; it's not. It's about as fragile as ceramic. If you treat it like your PVC figures, it will be just fine.\n\nThe thing people should worry about but don't is shipping costs, resin boxes are big and heavy, which means it will be very expensive.\n\nThat said, I don't trust First 4 Figures anymore. They've had too many structural issues in their resins to make me want to buy from them consistently. However, Faye might be fine because it's a simple pose and not many small parts.",

Bebop is my favorite anime of all time and I have the 1/4 Faye and love the base but the pose on this looks awkward and the base does leave a lot to be desired. I would chose the 1/4 over this any day. I got mine on sale and used points from TOM's US warehouse so I got free shipping too. \n\nI hope they go back and do another round of bebop because Spike Jet and Ed/Ein were not nearly as good looking as Fayes.",

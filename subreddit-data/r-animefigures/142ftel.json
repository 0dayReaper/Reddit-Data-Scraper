Zero for their siblings and friends.\n\nDon't take these too seriously. They are just for fun. ;)",

Either it connects with you on a deep level, or just makes you extremely happy to own compared to the rest of your collection.

This seems to be especially prominent with figures from new and popular shows (probably because they're pumping figures out as fast as possible to capitalize on the hype). It's damn near impossible for me to find more than a handful of figures from Chainsaw Man, Spy x Family, or Demon Slayer that don't have fucked up faces. And when you do find a good figure with a decent face it's $400 for 1/7 \ud83d\ude43 Oh, and what is it with Marin's mouth that is so hard to get right?!?",

Makes no sense why Taiga Tiger version is 15,000 yen cheaper than Ami or Minorin despite releasing within a year of each other.\n\nAlso, people calling brand new figs grails, even though they are still readily available to order/pre-order. A grail is meant to be hard to find, not immediately available if you just use the search bar on any online retailer. Lolol (that said, Sneaker Bunko Aqua is my grail, and I'm stoked she got a rerelease because Dios mio I couldn't justify the prices). \n\nTo tag onto price, just the uninspired figs coming out that don't justify their increased price tag. It's easier for me to say \"nah, I'm good\" to more and more figs (my shelves thank me), and that seems lame. I don't want another basic standing fig of the same character. I want an actual fun figure that isn't playing exclusively for fan service. Give me Marin that's genuinely Marin being happy/excited about something vs. Smiling in a bikini, or give me figs of the actual MC and not just the woman co-characters. Just the main characters in general! Not just the fan service characters! Food Wars has a half dozen bunny figs, but none of the 3rd most important character Megumi? Let alone a scale of Soma? No scales of Kazuma? I'm going insane!",

The first one is of Priestess from Goblin slayer. The PuP figure of Goblin slayer himself is beautiful and highly detailed but is just regular sized. Meaning it won't look right to put L sized priestess towering over him. This would've been the first affordable version of her I could get and now I'm going to pass on it. Secondly shipping and duties for PuP figures usually cost me $50 on regular figure, it sucks but it's life, however most sites warn me that getting a L sized would make shipping much much more. So I will also have to skip out on the L sized Alucard that was announced. Just make normal sized scale figures. That's what's irritated me at the moment",

    "postText": "Hey all, \n\nSo I had been waiting on the announcements for a trio of ReZero figures to be available on amiami where I get most of my figures and somehow they just ended up not getting them and I completely missed the window through goodsmile. So I went looking and was thankfully able to find them on the CR store and at a decent price/shipping because I sub to their service. I figured they were a decently trustworthy place so I placed a small order that caught my eye and my preorder... and then everything kinda came crashing down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found out shortly after ordering that contrary to their website I at least had/still have a pre auth on my CC if not a full pending charge almost a full year out, and they apparently have a history of overselling pre orders and not saying anything until the very last minute. I tried getting help but days later I still haven't heard anything from them and have since found out even their in stock orders are somehow super delayed and I haven't heard anything on the prize fig I ordered.\n\nGiven all of this I started looking around at who might still have these open for pre order and only seemingly reputable one is BBTS. My only problem/concern is they are about $50 more expensive than the CR ones mainly cause of the  CR discounts, but if it's a better and more reliable experience I'm willing to spend the money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo does anyone here have experience with both and if you do which would you recommend?",

            "comment": "I got my Apex Tohru from CR. Packing was literally non existent but somehow the box was fine, however a common complain is CR boxes get beat to shit with no packing and your figures boxes will be beat to shit.\n\nBBTS Ive ordered several times from. Thats where I get my cheaper non essential figures from, which for me are nendos, the occasional PuP or prize figure, etc. I go this route because even after the markup, the total between a nendo/PuP will be roughly the same as if I ordered from JP, and I tend to cancel PO's on BBTS alot cause they let you do it at will and on cheaper figures there is no depsoit. So If i flip flop on a nendo or PuP, no harm no foul.\n\nHowever...BBTS is slow as fuck. I've had open PO's where the figure released in japan roughly a year prior. Usually not the case, but is common enough to be one of their big problems. However, they package well, you can combine shipping, the site is a breeze to use....for me it serves its purpose.\n\nId say BBTS is fine if you dont mind waiting an additonal 1-6+ months after US release. They can be late on items that have already released at other US retailers somehow. Lately Id say its 1-4 months behind whatever the target release date on the page says.",

                    "comment": "So how much of that delay is BBTS being slow and how much of it is just the US doesnt get stuff for a good 3-6mo after it releases in JP? From what Ive seen on several figures there seems to be a universal delay. For these specific ones JP stores seem to say Sep/Oct release and NA are saying Feb/March, but even for small stuff like PUP I routinely see differences in release times.\n\nLike I wont lie I'm still hopeful I can find these on JP release because both BBTS and CR are way overcharging for theirs, but they're so popular no JP store I could find had all 3 still for pre orders. I had to put a small downpayment down for these but id be willing to throw it away to save $100+ and get them 6months earlier",

I hate the term but lots of figures have \u201cbinned\u201d post release in the last year, and they will show up on Amiami preowned for less within weeks of release.\n\nOn one hand with a BBTS PO you have the certainty that the figure will get to you, one fine day.\n\nOn the other, you could have it from Amiami preowned for less and not wait 6 months after release to receive it. But there\u2019s the risk it won\u2019t show up on the secondary market, like a certain Misato figure I wish I had pulled the trigger on\u2026",

That's exactly it. Should be the BBTS mantra -Set it and forget it. And forget it you will if you value your sanity. If you can't cope with seeing everyone else getting theirs in advance you might have a problem. On the other hand hassle free cancellations if the figure has huge problems feels pretty sweet.",

I see no appeal to any of that unless it's an only option for a must have.\n\n Nothing from CR I ever got was legitimately damaged on arrival. My only BBTS order (that I eventually cancelled) was overpriced by 100 dollars from what I finally bought it for, and had several delays.",

That said on these specific figures their price is actually pretty fair and shipping costs are gonna be relatively cheap. So it should be equal it's just higher price and taxes vs 60+ to ship it.",

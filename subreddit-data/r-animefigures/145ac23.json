I find that incredibly sexy and it\u2019s a shame that the figure itself lacks this particular detail. That, and the fact that they added socks when she\u2019s barefoot in the illustration for whatever reason. Bare feet and painted toenails in that pose would\u2019ve been hot af, but that\u2019s probably the foot fetishist in me speaking, lol",

[This is Myethos on Weibo, you can see that 899 yuan for Mary here too.](https://weibo.com/Myethos). \n\nI have looked through their posts there, and gathered the prices in yuan of their previous figures, that were also available for preorder on AmiAmi in the past. I've used here the original list price without the usual -17% discount, and I've calculated how does it compare to the prices given in yuan. \n\nfigure description | \u00a5(AmiAmi) | \u5143(Weibo) | \u00a5 / \u5143\n---|---|---|---\nSewayaki Kitsune no Senko-san Senko 1/7 | 12800 | 550 | 23.27\nWHITE ALBUM 2 Setsuna Ogiso 1/7 | 17600 | 799 | 22.03\nWHITE ALBUM 2 Kazusa Touma 1/7 | 17600 | 799 | 22.03\nA-Z: [S] 1/7 | 13800 | 698 | 19,77\nDAOMU Kylin Zhang 1/7  | 17600 | 817 | 21.54\nDragon Nest Argenta 1/7  | 13800 | 698 | 19.77\nOnmyoji Yoto Hime Scarlet Saber ver. 1/8  | 17600 | 799 | 22.03\nHonor of Kings Consort Yu: Yun Ni Que Ling Ver. 1/7 | 18920 | 899 | 21.05\nNational Treasure Cup of Eternal Solid Gold 1/7 | 19580 | 899 | 21.78\nHonor of Kings Jia Luo: Tai Hua ver. 1/7  | 18920 | 899 | 21.05\nA-Z: [B] 1/7 | 13800 | 698 | 19.77\n\nYou can see that the ratio doesn't match the yen / yuan exchange rate (which is 16.74 right now), but it's largely around 20-22.\n\nThe minimum value is 19.77 the maximum is 23.27. So taking that 899 yuan original price, on **AmiAmi** the list price for Mary Saotome comes out as a range of 17774\u00a5 - 20922\u00a5.\nTaking into account the usual **-17%** preorder discount it will be **14752\u00a5 - 17635\u00a5**",

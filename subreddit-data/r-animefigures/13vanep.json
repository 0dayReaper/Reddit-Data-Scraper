Got her brand new and I finally opened her (moving woes) and her pigtail was broken clean from her head. I can't seem to get the pigtail to stay with just glue since it needs better support but wanted to see if anyone had advice on how to fix or if they had this happen to theirs before",

            "comment": "For broken pigtails, I always pin them as gravity is a bitch. If the glue isn't sticking at all, use a different glue type or you can get CA with an activator which seems to help out. Some clear plastics don't like CA (superglue).\n\nFor pinning, you need a small metal rod/wire and a pin vise to make a hole. The stuff I use is 1.5mm diameter jewelry wire. I usually chop off around 1cm length. Drill a hole into both sides and test fit your rod. If you're happy with the fit, glue the rod into one side and let dry (can use a toothpick to help apply glue). Put glue on the other half of the rod and the joining surfaces and assemble. Hold parts together until the glue makes a bond. Let dry. One very attached pigtail \ud83d\ude42",

Thankfully I was able to balance the figure on the broken peg and use the extra support peg to assist in keeping her in place. I really hope you can fix her because this is such a gorgeous figure",

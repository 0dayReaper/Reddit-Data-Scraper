There is also licensing the original character from the particular artist and then if it\u2019s a studio project like say,  a Trigger character. That could take longer due to intellectual rights tied to a company and it\u2019s policies. You need to have something to show when you sign and even when they do that, they have to change designs for cost and fix issues. It just takes time. Oh and downvote me all you want. It just shows you all don\u2019t know how long it takes for figures to be planned and made. Sure some companies can and do have a streamlined process but even that takes time and can have delays. Ganyu was planned in advance and had a massive long order queue. Then they took to molding and painting and they made mistakes rushing it. The bands on her leg were either not painted or poorly painted on.  Planning and production should both take time for both parts to be correct.",

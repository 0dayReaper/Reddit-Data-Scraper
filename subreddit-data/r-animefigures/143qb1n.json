The smoke is more nebulous though. It will definitely air out, given enough time though. You can speed it up, but most of the material here is nearly impermeable, so it won't hold on to the smell very long. You can wash it with warm water and dish soap, but I wouldn't say it is needed unless it is otherwise dirty.",

Do not, ever, use anti bacterial soap, as it can end up destroying the paint. If not immediately then over time. \n\nWater is okay if it is ABS and/or Polystone. Water is okay with any fabric. It has a chance of leaving marks however. Especially darker colors. (I'm thinking bunny figure stockings as an example). \n\nLess sturdy and complex figures also has a chance to break during the process.\n\nWell it isn't to say you're completely wrong. You can wash them, however it's much safer and better to dust them once in a while. Ideally you'd want to have them displayed in a glass cabinet to avoid these issues.\n\nEdit: If you ever get a sticky figure it is a different matter ofc. In this case you'll have to wash it. I recommend goodsmile's guide [I will link it here](https://mikatan.goodsmile.info/en/2013/06/20/dealing-with-stickiness-on-figures/)",

What warm water is leaving marks, regardless of the material? Yes, be careful when washing, but you aren't going to break it trivially from washing it. Really the only thing you have to worry about is when handling an unsealed figure, or one with stickers?",

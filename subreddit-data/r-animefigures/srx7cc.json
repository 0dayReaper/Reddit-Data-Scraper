It\u2019s not completely screen accurate, but unless I wanted to have an entire rooftop in my display case, I had to make some design changes for a smaller base. \n\nTook about a month from start to finish, most of the time was spent on planning and viewing screenshots from the movie from every angle possible.\n\nMaterials used:  \nWood panel for bottom of base   \nWooden dowels for the gate  \nPlastruct Styrene 1mm sheets and 3.2mm square rods for a majority of the base and bricks  \nApoxie sculpt   \nPlants were clipped off from artificial desk plants  \nMr. Color and Vallejo paints via airbrush and hand brush",

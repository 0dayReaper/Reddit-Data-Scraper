The details are insane, from the tiles on the roof top, to the texture on the rope and the prints on her sash and umbrella. \n\nThat base was super heavy ngl and she was bigger than I anticipated as it  makes my other unlicensed \u201c1/4\u201d statues look small cause of the base/umbrella/moon. \n\nI had to fiddle around like others with the right hand holding the umbrella and connecting to hair. I ended up putting some blue tac just to make sure that it doesn\u2019t pop out so now it feels stable AF!  Tomorrow I should also put some on the connecting point on her tail as well. \n\nAlso her legs were a bit tight together and didn\u2019t spread far enough to reach the peg on the roof so used a hair dryer to ease it apart which made me super nervous. \ud83d\ude33\n\nAll in all very nice statue and definitely the definitive Mai out right now imo. \n\nPardon the pics not a great photographer.",

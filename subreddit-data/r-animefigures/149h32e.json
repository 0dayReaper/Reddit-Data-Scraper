            "comment": "Have spent months working on and off to build these shelves since moving out. The worst part was cutting down the acrylic I bought down to the right sizes. No matter how much I scored it I just couldn't get it to break cleanly. Also kind of regret going for the black sheets to line the shelves. I think it looks great but I tried washing them to prevent dye transfer and it didn't work. Must have done it wrong. Hope to get some fur so I can take some figures off risers. \n\nWhen I have the funds I'll need to get some more risers though and rearrange things a little bit. The Nekopara collection will have to go to a different shelf because I'll definitely be getting more over time and the 1/4's clearly don't fit there.",

I've forgone furnishing my place some to accommodate extra expenses I didn't plan for and buying tools to accomplish some tasks.\n\nDoing a rough estimate with prices as they are now I come up with a total of $1365. Bought shelves at a discount from Walmart on black Friday. I also only half finished a third shelf that isn't shown here which is factored into that dollar value some. I'd have to spend more on top of that for acrylic to finish that shelf because I destroyed it all trying to cut it. The acrylic is by far the most expensive part and I don't need that shelf right now.\n\nIt was possible to spend less but I was dumb several times throughout this process. I did consider getting Moducases before I started all of this but the wait time put me off. I'd still be waiting.",

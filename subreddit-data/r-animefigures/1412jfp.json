I know these kits were highly sought after and go for a premium too... so if it's those you were looking at, might want to put that idea on the back burner lol.\n\n(I assume you mean Wonfes by \"wondercon\".  There has recently been Wonhobby which is just prepainted stuff. Wonfes is a con of two halves - the manufacturer announcements and the GK hall that is mostly vendors selling unpainted kits on a limited license).",

She's been a highly sought after grail of mine for a couple years now...there's been several instances too where I nearly bought one secondhand around the $200-$300 range, so glad I waited!! This gives me a lot of hope for a rerelease of the Ultimate Madoka and Akuma Homura 1/8 scales in the near future!",

They don't go \"wow it's huge I want it\" for 1/4 alot of times unless they are new to the hobby. Unless it's a 1/2 or something that it's worth talking about. \n\nNormally I will agree the bigger a figure is, the better the details can be as well. But currently most 1/4 , especially BINDing is like in the weird spot where the figures bring nothing new that a 1/6 or 1/5 cannot achieve, but take up more space",

    "postText": "hi!\n\ni just preordered a FREEing figure on Amazon Japan and im wondering if the 10% GST that Australia charges was applied to the final price? or will I get charged for the tax when the figure enters Australia? \n\nGoodSmile adds the 10% tax at checkout but AmazonJP didn\u2019t have any separate charges, only shipping &amp; handling. Just wondering if I\u2019m going to be hit with an extra 10% sometime in the future when the figure enters the country. I can\u2019t find any solid information on it.",

There's so much about her I could praise, from the blue parts of her apparel to her pose and all that, not to mention that while the stand looks kinda plain I like the texture on it, it's like polished marble. Great choice!\n\nThe Ironmouse Nendoroid is simply too precious to exist. o-o\n\nHappy future collecting to you!!",

We had a flood caused by city maintenance workers hitting a water line that poured uncontrollably for several days downhill and into our backyard.\n\nWas fun waking up to 4.5 ft of water in my basement as well as our storage room completely submerged. After the evaluation from our insurer we were given a 80-page booklet double sided with everything that was damaged. A lot of my collector items were rare and hard to find so they tried to just write a quick msrp for something and be done with it, many many revisions for done, but worth it.\n\nIn the end the house ended up sinking due to the amount of water that had flooded our property which cracked the foundation..... took 6-months for that payout too as well as living with a house partially covered... sorry your post made me rant. It gets better and I hope everyone was safe! It also hurts for people loose things they enjoy even if it\u2019s something smaller.",

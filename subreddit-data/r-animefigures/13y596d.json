    "postText": "Last year I ordered this Gyutaro and Daki figuarts figure from MecchaJapan. It finally arrived on Thursday but when I opened the box the figure was visibly damaged from the plastic and upon opening that too, the leg of the figure was completely detached and the pegs on Daki's obi sash that connect in to the leg had also broken off and were tiny pieces in the box. The figure has difficulty standing up without the leg and it just falls out when you try to slot it back in to the upper part.\n\nThe weird part is that the package all of the figures came in had no marks or damage, not even any cuts or scratches. The other figures are all fine and even the box itself for the Daki and Gyutaro figure is intact.\n\nI contacted MecchaJapan through the site and then through their support email. They got back pretty fast however they only offered me a 50% voucher. I'm not very happy with this since the figure doesn't even stand up so it's bascially worthless. Even if I tried to glue it back on, the figure wouldn't be stable since the main \"stand\" is Daki's obi itself which is supported by Gyutaro and the pegs that it connects to on the legs are completely shattered.\n\nI feel like I should get a full refund or at least get to return it and get a new one sent our. Wondering what I should do or if anyone has similar experiences.",

            "comment": "Yeah, one figure can break in a package of more figures, and points to poor blister design. Likely your package was vibrated/shaken in transit (which can happen on the plane or on conveyors) which smacked the figure against the blister repeatedly and broke it. \n\nWhen I was on mobile, I couldn't clearly see all the breaks - it might be worth highlighting the broken sections and explaining they need more repairing than mere gluing (it's possible, but time consuming and I wouldn't think it unfair to push for a 75%+ refund esp on a Kimetsu No Yaiba figure). You could potentially sell the remains to someone willing to fix it, but aftermarket looks to be about 10-11k jpy (this one hasn't suffered badly as some of the other figures), so you're maybe looking at 3-5k resale value? I think it is fixable via gluing and pinning, but it will be a chunk of work.",

And even if they let you keep the remains to sell/repair, 50% voucher just doesn't seem enough for that extent of damage. \n\n(Saw someone mention bandai having a form - if they do might as well give it a go imo. But doing a quick Google it looks US only and your post history suggests you're located in Ireland. Bandai does tend to forget Europe is a place that exists....).",

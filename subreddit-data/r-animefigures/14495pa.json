It doesn\u2019t matter how many times I\u2019ve looked at the pictures, appreciating a figure irl is always really different. I\u2019ve never truly been disappointed yet, maybe I was just lucky with my purchases tho :)",

            "comment": "[Kadokawa's 1/7 scale Faputa figure](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1464752). If you look at the promotional images for it, it seems pretty bad. The lighting and the angles they picked seem to make her face look weird. Despite being a huge Made in Abyss fan I didn't preorder this one because of that.  \n  \nBut then later on, once people started uploading photos of it, it actually turned out that it's not a bad figure after all. It looks way better in [this photo](https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/3538101), for example. Sales for this figure seemed to have been pretty bad since AmiAmi didn't even run out of preorder slots, so I was easily able to grab one.  \n  \nKadokawa is also releasing [a 1/7 scale Nanachi figure](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1464750), and it appears to have the same issue. [There's a photo of the two figures side-by-side](https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/3273057&amp;context%5B%5D=itemId%3A1464750) and they both just look a bit weird. I think there's a very good chance that this Nanachi figure will also end up looking way better in real life, so I ended up preordering it as well.",

            "comment": "Gonna give this one to APEX. Particularly the figures that I got - raiden mei and yae Sakura from Honkai3rd and ningguang from genshin. All 3 figures are best of the best in terms of the main figures themselves, but they create such a great background to go with the figure, it's like including the splash art of a gacha card. The sheer number of accessories you get is pleasing, and they never mention any extra goodies in their preorder descriptions, like cards, files, or shikishis, so it feels good when you see that. It feels even better considering their pricing is much cheaper, specially for the amount of stuff you get.",

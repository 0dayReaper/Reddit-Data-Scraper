I had to prop her up a bit to fit it, and she leaned quite a bit that way without it.  The other one I extended are far as I could and it was barely making contact with her hair.  She seems to have settled a little now after a day and a half, and I can tell there's a little pressure between that stand and her hair now.  I think I'll try and get a small piece of acrylic to put under that stand to raise it a bit because the extended pole seems like it'll just get pushed back down if it was actually under any significant pressure.",

I would have liked if they included an extra arm without the sword because it adds to both her height and width.",

I was secretly hoping for Nia to get something similar to what intelligent Systems did with their Byleth (Fire Emblem) scale, where her hand / wrist can be adjusted to accommodate the blade in hand. I would love to have an extra arm without the blade, or even some other accessories or alternate pose, like Megahouse's Lucrea lineup does.\n\nThank you so much for your answer. You knew exactly what I was asking for. :)",

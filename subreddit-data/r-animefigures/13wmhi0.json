    "postText": "Hey all, just wanna drop a question if someone could give their opinions. Recently, I went in and checked the F:NEX Yuta 1/7 Scale Figure from Jujutsu Kaisen 0, and I've seen several listings with significant discounts on sites like Mercari and Yahoo Japan. Additionally, it's not just 1 or 2 listings, there's multiple listings where his has like 15k-20k yen off from his original retail price of around 60k yen. Additionally, I'm pretty positive it's not bootleg or anything, since these listings have photos of the boxes where the logo \"Furyu\", \"F:NEX\" and \"MAPPA\" can clearly be seen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone have any idea what might be going on? Jujutsu Kaisen doesn't seem like an IP on decline, and I've never seen a figure price tank this badly so close after release.",

            "comment": "The figure market is oversaturated and overproduced right now, so all prices have been falling as there's more stock than buyers. It's even worse for hit animes of the season, like JJK, because they produce so many figures in a short span of time once it becomes a hit (oversaturation), but people move on after the season ends when most of these scales release (overproduced).",

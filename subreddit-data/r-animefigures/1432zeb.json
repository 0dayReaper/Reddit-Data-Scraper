Most are Ok, but I ordered a pre-owned Selvaria figure by Veltex recently in almost new condition and one of her arms got broken and twisted in the box. Of course, my refund offer was accepted.\n\nBe careful about bootlegs, some popular series like Elf-village are sold too cheap and were reported there were bootleg sellers.",

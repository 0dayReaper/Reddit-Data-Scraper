This is way too short for that, and it's missing the A-line/ bell shape from a petticoat. \n\nIt's a cute outfit, but she'd absolutely be slammed by the lolita community if she tried to fit in there lol.",

Lolita is definitely a lot more victorian/ formal/ over the top feeling than something like this that's definitely casual. I think a better label for this style might be something like girly or feminine.",

If they called it more specific this could be a start of a new line with different fashion styles but when it's only subculture it's hard see if they want to create it as something bigger. Hope we could see it upgraded with new figures though because having a series made by Taito where the main role is a clothing style would be so cool!

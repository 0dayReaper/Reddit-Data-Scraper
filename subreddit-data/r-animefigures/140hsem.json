    "postText": "Howdy! I am selling my two Berserk Figmas, and the Kaguya and Chika Nendoroid figures. \n\nVerification Photos (Please let me know if I did this wrong, not really sure how to do the preview.reddit thing)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnb6a8w7y04b1.jpg?width=1868&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=296c75c78e1f96ce143aeefc87b92211273bcbf2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bilcr8w7y04b1.jpg?width=1868&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=835b10d9fad58912df92bec678f2570072c33417\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qteugew7y04b1.jpg?width=1868&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b41af70bd0cfe9718d7f297079e7afbf35a9f932\n\nPrices are listed in USD, as I am in the US, and do not include shipping. I would be willing to ship outside the country, I would just have to look up how because I've never done so haha. Prices also are not firm, feel free to make an offer! \n\nI use PayPal G&amp;S and will cover the fee for that. \n\nBerserk- Guts Berserk Armor ver. Skull/repaint: $150 (Opened and displayed for a few days, and put back in box. Comes with all original accessories) [https://myfigurecollection.net/item/675838](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/675838)\n\nBerserk- Griffith: $90 (Same as Guts, however there is a small indent in the cape. It isn't quite a hole, but is definitely not supposed to be there. Can provide pictures of it if desired.) [https://myfigurecollection.net/item/97443](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/97443)\n\nLove is War- Kaguya Shinomiya Nendoroid Doll: $45 (Never opened) [https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1213479](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1213479)\n\nLove is War- Chika Fujiwara Nendoroid Doll: $45 (Never opened)[https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1213480](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1213480)\n\nI'll sell the two dolls together for $80, and the two figures together for $220. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to message me here, or on MFC!

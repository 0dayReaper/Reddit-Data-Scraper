    "postText": "I was in Akihabara and bought a future Gohan figure from the mandarake store. It was in the box and labeled as \"resealed\" as opposed to \"used\" like other items. So I decided to get it and out of not wanting to risk tax exemption issues, didn't open it until I got home. \n\nWell the figure looks great except for his hair. There is this orange tint at the front. Comparing it to pictures online, that is not supposed to be the case. Was wondering what options I had in correcting this? Thanks!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/iFWeBwL\n\nEdit: [Comparison](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hNUCXIBBL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)\n\n2nd Edit: Found my answer. Thanks!",

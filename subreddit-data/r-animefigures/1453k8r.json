If you wanted it regardless, it doesn't matter what happens in the after market. Sure you may want a deal, but if you really want it, I wouldn't risk it. It's also listed as limited/exclusive, so finding it in the aftermarket is generally harder.\n\nYou considering to risk waiting to see if it tanks, might be telling though. Make sure you actually want it and it isn't FOMO.",

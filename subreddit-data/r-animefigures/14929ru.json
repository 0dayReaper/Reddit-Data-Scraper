    "postText": "The subreddit is completing its participation in [the 48-hour blackout which was called in protest of Reddit's planned changes to its API](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1476fkn/reddit_blackout_2023_save_3rd_party_apps/).\n\nTo recap, those changes are likely to result in [the demise of most existing third-party Reddit apps, causing accessibility issues for the visually-impaired, and complicate moderation](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/).\n\nOver eight thousand subreddits participated in the blackout.\n\nThe blackout's immediate effects on Reddit were to [crash the site a couple of times](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/api-pricing-protests-caused-reddit-to-crash-for-3-hours/) and [prompted CEO Steve Huffman to issue/leak a memo](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/reddit-ceo-assures-employees-that-api-protests-havent-hurt-revenue/) in which he continues to double down on creative interpretations of the truth and maintain that in the end, only the money matters.\n\n(The dissonance of using an Advance Publications-owned site to report on Reddit is noted.)\n\nWe have exited the blackout, as we do feel that our particular benefits for the figure-collecting community should be maintained, at least in the short term. News about the efforts of the continuing protests will continue to appear here.",

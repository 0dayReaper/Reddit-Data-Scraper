There might be some occasional simple gradient on stuff like hair but it's pretty minimal.\n\nI don't agree that people say they don't look good up close. Other companies product like Banpresto, yes - you WILL see all sort of problems. But Taito has managed to keep things REALLY clean for the most part, edges are all smooth &amp; barely any seam, the figures looks fine up close, which is why they are the best among prize figure maker.\n\nAlso, no fancy base.",

ALso, Taito figures tend to look great from long-medium distance, but when taking a close look you will see many imperfections like paint scuffs, seam lines, parts that haven't been sanded properly etc. because quality control standards for these figures are on the lower end.\n\nDon't get me wrong, they are great for the price, but there is definitely a huge trade-off that you are making. Also, there are a lot of used figure options that are quite cheap. E.g. [https://myfigurecollection.net/item/13777](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/13777)  I have seen often for $50 on yahoo auctions.",

And taito is actually the cheapest among them all when you look at coreful or wonderland lines and compare it to any furyu line or any banpresto. Among all standard prize producers taito is a clear winner when it comes to look (tho I understand that it can be subjective) and weirdly enough price too.",

But that is an unfair comparison given the orice difference. \n\nTaito is generally doing a good job, butI will have to mention that Taito is notorious for fucking up male figures.\n\nAs far as price goes, I dont find taito being cheaper than Sega / Furyu prize figures, but that also depends per figure and the store you are buying from. Granted I rarely buy prize figures, but I do see the pricing when I am browsing online.",

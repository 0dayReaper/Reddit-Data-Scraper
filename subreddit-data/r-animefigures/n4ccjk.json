Can't really expect people to sell something for substantially less than other people are getting for it, and if they did it just makes it that much more likely someone would buy it purely to scalp it at a higher price for profit\n\nI definitely agree though, it's always nice to hear someone found a figure they love at a price that works for them! :)",

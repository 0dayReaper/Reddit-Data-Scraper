Took way longer than expected but was well worth it! I tried my best with the panorama shot (2nd pic), but i guess i need to improve my photography skills.",

But if you do feel more comfortable with the measurements and alignments to be done more perfectly, maybe the Ikea assembly staff could do a  better job as they are more experienced.",

    "postText": "So I finally to fully invest into the hobby &amp; started researching on how to take care of my collection. I know UV rays can be harmful to figures; unfortunately the only spot I have open is exposed to a window. I heard privacy film on the windows will work very well but I move quite a lot so I figured my best choice was to attach the film to the back of the Detolf.\n\nTL;DR : Just wanted to know if this is enough protection so my collection is safe?",

            "comment": "In theory it should work, but why not place the film on the windows of your room itself? Although UV radiation loses a lot of its energy bouncing off of stuff, you still have some light entering from the sides. And even then, it also depends on the direction your window is facing and the time of day where the sun is at in relation to your window. Hence why I think the simplest solution is to just tint your room windows and not just the detolf rear glass.\n\nEDIT: I noticed you mentioned moving, but tbh, it's harder to move a detolf than it is to just re-install window tint in the new place where you move. Unless there's some rule that doesn't allow you to tint your windows since you're renting, etc...",

(Over all I think I\u2019ll just have to angle/close the blinds regardless)",

In fact I'd argue that it's much easier to do stuff to your room than it is to modify a DETOLF unless it's something like introducing panel height adjusters.\n\nMy setup looks like [this](https://preview.redd.it/ry5gojgrgrja1.jpg?width=2100&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3caf0122c1839062b268c18b0313f53c24e5794d) if it helps (here in the light but [without the blinds](https://preview.redd.it/5rizpzb3o3u91.jpg?width=3197&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bae3bcb72104d441e5cead5d412db08c2c26af62) installed yet). I use [Ikea SCHOTTIS](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/schottis-pleated-shade-white-90431378/) to cut down on most of the UV without compromising the light into the room, then go over this with roller blinds. I think these were [SKOGSKL\u00d6VER](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/skogskloever-roller-blind-white-00431392/) blinds. The combination of light filtering makes it so that I can adjust the brightness more easily without having to open up the SCHOTTIS blinds.\n\nI also use a [RUDSTA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/rudsta-glass-door-cabinet-anthracite-60434825/) as my display up against the window since my room faces the east and gets quite a lot of sunlight in the morning, so the covered back gives me a bit more assurance. But even with the exposed display on top of the RUDSTA, there is no evidence of fading on any of my figures that have been put there over several months.",

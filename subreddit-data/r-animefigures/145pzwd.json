If they have a base no worry but like this one long term it might damage them. Also, if you use amazon you should be able to find red fabric. Just a quick search shows red velvet fabric",

Stick with white or get a plastic coating to lay out over the fabric to create a base between the figures and fabric itself. I'd just opt with white to be extra safe because I've had red plastic dye figure pieces so not sure if the red dye would eventually dye the plastic coating and then your figures lol",

    "postText": "So I bought the Yuuki Nanase figure from Jlist over year ago and still haven\u2019t gotten any updates. Also when I logged into my account it says I no longer have an order history. I messaged Jlist over a week ago and still haven\u2019t heard anything back. Looking for help or guidance. I thought they would be a reputable dealer since I saw them at some cons in the past. Any info and any help would be great thank you!",

I know that there are doll versions of Yukino Miyazawa &amp; Souichirou Arima and that you can purchase this really ugly official figure with them both, but I found out there are also 2 resin kits for Yukino. Unfortunately, I have found nothing on either of them, and even with searching for them in Japanese there are no results. Any info?? I\u2019ve seen real photos of the products but maybe they were just prototypes\u2026",

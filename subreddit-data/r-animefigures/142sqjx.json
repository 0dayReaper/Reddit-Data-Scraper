It doesn't seem like too much investment to try putting a few figures or so down there to see what you feel about it? Like it's not permanent and it doesn't take that long if you try a few, and you can always move them back...?\n\nThe bottom shelf does tend to be less ideal. I try to put figures where it doesn't look as strange looking down on them. Like if I have a figure that's sleeping on their back so she looks great on my bottom shelf but generally it's not as great\n\nUsually I move a figure around to see how I feel about it on different shelves, with different figures, different risers etc.\n\nI have to use my bottom shelves because of space limits.",

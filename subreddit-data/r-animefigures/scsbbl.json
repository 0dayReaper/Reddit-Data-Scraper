Also pirating anime doesn't help either. So when i watched someone explain that one of the more effective ways to help them is through buying merchandise like figures, blu rays, dvds etc. So i said screw it, why not? The other reason being is, i used to have these toys called bionicles and collecting figures reminded me when i used to collect bionicles back in the day. I still am looking for them till this very day.",

They call us anime fans pedophiles, belittling csa survivors in the process, and think they are in the right. How does harassing you empower victims and stop perpetrators? And then what would they do if their child or grandchild liked anime? I doubt they have every thought about what their words really mean. It is just sad man.",

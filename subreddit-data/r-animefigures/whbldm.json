Freeing released a scale figure of Taiga in a very cute bunny suit only for them to later release a tiger version (after many have already preordered the first one.) So what they initially meant with Komi is that they have this current bunny suit but perhaps down the line they\u2019ll release a similar figure but neko versioned.",

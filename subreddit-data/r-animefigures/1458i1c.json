Mio might see a little more demand but still, I\u2019d say you\u2019re safe on all 3 if you don\u2019t want to pre-order. I\u2019m pretty confident GSC US will have an Elishka sale bundle a year from now.",

At least pre-ordering will guarantee that you will get one either way.\n\nI think that you can take a chance waiting on the Black Rock Shooter figures since there are so many on the market or will be soon. I don't know about the other one.",

I wish I was more into the stuff BINDing makes (or maybe it's a blessing I'm not) but 1/4 scale just takes up so much space. \n\nGets annoying to see so many of them going up for order when I'm sitting here waiting for Native or some of their other partner brands to put up stuff I've been anticipating for months though.",

Will my account get nuked if I cancel my pre-orders? \n\nThanks in advance for the help.",

Since I've been a long time customer and always paid for my pre orders on time I guess I'm on good standing with them since I've canceled a lot and I mean a lot of Pre Orders before except one time when I tried to Pre Order 2 figures which totaled over $300 I got an email asking whether I wanted to confirm if I really did want to Pre Order them since I was canceling a lot of orders in such a short period of time beforehand.  Usually I cancel my Pre Orders over a span of time but I was having a bit of money trouble and canceling most of my orders all at once which I guess might have been a warning.\n\nI'd say if you're canceling too many order in a short of amount of time or all them at once it might affect your account, or you could try talking to customer service just in case before making the cancels.",

    "postText": "I've preordered a few nendoroids from them back in Jan 2022 and I'm still waiting for the Toge Inumaki nendoroid to arrive. It sort of sucks to see it in-stock on other sites. Haven't heard an update since May and I have had to email for updates. \n\n**Is this lag happening for other preorders still or is this website the only one left behind?** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've placed another order from them because their customer service has been wonderful and their prices are cheap, but I am sorely debating choosing another website for future preorders. At least until this extreme lag of shipment goes away in the future.\n\n**Any recommendations for websites that sell prize figures and other merch that have good customer service and shipping?**",

I'm probably not going to preorder from them for awhile until the delay gets better, especially since they take full payment up front and I can't cancel.",

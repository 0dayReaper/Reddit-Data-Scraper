            "comment": "Just took [her](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1465673) out of the box  \n  \nHave to admit, considering i didn't really like the first Koto Hololive scale, they have fully converted me with the recent ones.  \n  \nSubaru pose is, for lack of better term, \"fun\". She really gives the impression of being mid-cheering and jumping  \n  \nThat and the relatively uncommon (for a figure) color scheme make her pop out a lot.  \nSpeaking of color, they did mostly a great job with her. The yellow, red and blues are quite vibrant and well painted. She has a few messed up spots in her shoes but i had to really zoom in to find them and they don't really show up from normal distance, so i'd consider it really minor  \n  \nI kinda wish the'd have gone with a magnet for her cap (like they did with the head accessories of the previous two HL girls) but i guess the position would have made it tricky.  \n  \nA thing i didn't notice until having her in hand was the horn being made in clear plastic. it's a very minor thing but i feel it looks nicer that way so kudos to them  \n  \nPutting Subaru, Ayame and Shion side by side also finally made it click that the bases aren't the same size; doesn't really bother me much, but i guess it means they *really* wanted to give Ayame her power stance XD  \n  \nSo, yeah, so far 3/3 satisfied on Koto output ( i'm even thinking of going back and re-evaluating if i want to grab the one i skipped). Hope they stick the landing with the last one in a few weeks",

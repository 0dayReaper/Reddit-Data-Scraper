I can't live without my Ctrl+Z that clean up my fuckups, or my automatic symmetry... Not to say, that I can reshape anything at any point if I don't like it, you gotta do it right the first time!!!Damn!\n\nI do get to print my waifus in 3D nowadays though, so that's a plus...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep up the good work! :D",

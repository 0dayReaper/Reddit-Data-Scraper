They are kind of weirdly large compared to the Alter Love Live 1/7 (as seen on the left), so I might have to find a different place for them. They\u2019re definitely not \u201cprize figure quality\u201d like a lot of people complained about based on the promo pics.",

I can\u2019t wait to have them all together and decorate my shelf with a starlight prologue theme \ud83d\ude2d was my first goal for my collection getting back into this hobby \ud83e\udd79\n\nI do think they are overpriced tho, especially since they are guaranteed to bin.",

I used a bunch of TOM points to get these two, so no biggie. But now I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m patient enough to wait for the rest of the set to go on discount, but I\u2019m going to regret not waiting it if they go way down in price\u2026",

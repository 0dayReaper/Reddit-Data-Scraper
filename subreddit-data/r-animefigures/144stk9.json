So I want to know if i have to go to the customs to pay the fee or do I have to wait for the delivery and pay it to the delivery person. How does the shipping work?\n\nFigure that I preordered: \nhttps://www.play-asia.com/senran-kagura-new-wave-g-burst-15--scale-pre-painted-figure-rate-/13/70g02l",

Easiest would be to call your postal service helpline and ask them.\n\nIf you are shipping via a curier, they will mostlikely ask you to pay tax by a transfer.\n\nIf you tell us which country you are from, maybe someone will know.",

Was thinking possibly about printing a new base for the cross but seems Amelia needs it for support so maybe something with magnets since she is on a metal bottom shelf, idk shall see. Also the base has maybe 1mm of clearance from the door (Ikea MILSBO). With that being said the base is entirely too big to fit in a Detolf.",

This would probably work in a glass case as well as long as you have a magnet to place on the other side of the glass.",

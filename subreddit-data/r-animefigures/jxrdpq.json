I'll never wish for someones pain, but she downright deserved it. Hope he wins.   \n\n\nAnime figures are not cheap, in fact, any hobby is not cheap. Hobbies are what truly define someone. It's your identity, be is collecting figurines, making stuffed animals, sports, crafts... it is you. As long as a hobby does not cause harm to anyone, and is not morally degrading, embrace that hobby.   \nPlus, I know a number of people that use hobbies as a coping mechanism. Many research has shown that hobbies are therapeutic, and that's why psychologists highly recommend us to pick up a hobby!   \n\n\nTrue, maybe the figurines take up a lot of space, and are expensive, but destroying them is not the way to solve it. If he really had an addiction, she should have counselled him on it. I never like to blame women solely for everything, but I really cannot find any reason to defend her. I would have done the same as the guy if someone destroyed my collection.    \n\n\nI really hope the guy can find a replacement for the figurine, although deep down it is sad to admit that it will never be the same, and I wish that the woman comes to realize that she is in the wrong.   \n\n\n(PS: Not a Demon Slayer fan, but that Nezuko figurine is stunning! I cannot fathom the sadness this guy must have felt upon hearing it was already incinerated).",

    "postText": "This figure is stunning! But as much as I\u2019d like to pick her up, a few things have me worried. First being the shipping cost. I know I could do surface premium, but with her size I feel like it\u2019s still going to be rather high. \n\nNext is that as amazing as she looks, she seems just as fragile. I normally try to steer clear of figures that may lean or parts that may warp/droop. \n\nLast is how newer figures hit the bin these days. I\u2019m still fairly new to collecting but everything I\u2019ve gotten so far has been second hand or binned figures that I really enjoy. \n\nAre these concerns just in my head? Everywhere I look people seem to be really hype for her. I\u2019m thinking I could wait, but after seeing what happens to some* GoodSmile scales in the aftermarket, I\u2019m feeling that dreaded FOMO. D:",

            "comment": "I'd say those concerns are warranted and valid. Some people are just more willing to face those risks than others. Especially when it comes to aftermarket pricing. \n\nFigures seem to either bin or double/triple in the aftermarket, not a lot of in between. I'm still pretty bummed about my F:Nex 1/7 Kokkoro who I paid 19k yen for and now regularly see for 5.6k yen. If you wanted to try to make a more educated guess on how likely the figure is to bin, find other recently released similar figures (in this case, BRS scales, or BRS in general) and see how much they're going for aftermarket vs market price. Good luck to you!",

            "comment": "i preordered her recently, max factory is pretty good at sturdy figures so I'm not worried about point 2, and the other recent BRS scale barely dropped in price even flawed as it was directly from GSC, so I doubt this will much either despite preorders not being closed this whole time. As for shipping, surface premium isnt a thing so if they wont ship her via normal surface which knowing amiami they probably wont, ill cancel rather than pay ridiculous shipping. For me it comes down to really wanting a BRS scale in my collection and its either this one or wait for-ev-er for the insane BRS wing scale. Good luck! if you do get her im sure you wont be disappointed",

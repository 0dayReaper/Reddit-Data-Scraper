If my friends get to know I spent this much money on these figurines, they'll go bonkers on me \ud83d\ude02\n\nI'm planning to put it inside my pc case but I'm a bit afraid. \n\nI see remakes of these figurines everywhere and they are like $7-$8 like what the actual f***. Heard a YouTuber saying originals have detailed finishings whereas the fakes don't have that. \n\nHas anyone bought fake figures and found out they are as good as the originals? Sorry I'm new to this subject",

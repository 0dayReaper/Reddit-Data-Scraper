Should I just opt for getting a larger box or should it be okay with extra bubble wrap? Thank you\ud83d\ude42",

If you can, try to grab a slightly bigger box and fill the gaps with bubble wrap or newspaper. I personally like to use bubble wrap to protect the box itself and fill the gaps with whatever I can find, never had any issues. :)",

Never had any issue on mine.  \n\nBut when I ordered figure from Amazon, it was packed so callously that the box that contained figure arrived badly damaged with minimal padding.  I avoided ordering figures from Amazon after that.",

    "postText": "Has anyone preordered from right stuff anime before? I want an xxxholic nendroid which I saw on Ali express for almost $70 but an earlier release date. Then I found it on right stuff for only $43 but it\u2019s release date is several months later. I preordered from sure thing toys in the past and they were AWFUL at fulfilling preorders it just kept getting pushed later and later. So I\u2019m wondering if this site is better or if it\u2019s best to stick with Asian shops?",

I've quit buying from the since due to a couple of things the new owners did with the site (and certain merchandise that was eliminated) and there have been multiple issues with pre-orders being cancelled for merchandise with no good reason.",

            "comment": "Right Stuf is legit but they take a long while to ship. Prices for figures are not great either and shipping tends to be a lot for figures for some reason. I know you said it was $43 with Right Stuf but check the shipping costs. I\u2019m willing to bet it\u2019s about $15 minimum. I don\u2019t think the small savings are worth it if it means waiting months. \n\nYou are better off trying Big Bad Toy Store since they usually offer $4 shipping for most things and you can use their pile of loot feature to stockpile everything and then ship it all at once to save on shipping costs.",

I\u2019m not sure which one you are looking for but shipping would be $4 (for me it would be anyway). \n\nThis site is legit as well. I\u2019ve bought many things from them and they package things very well.",

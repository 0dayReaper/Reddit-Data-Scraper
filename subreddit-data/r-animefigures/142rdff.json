    "postText": "I was away when they arrived from China. It was a big box but it was light. I think some who are interested might enjoy the images and close ups. Sorry for dullness in some pictures, it was late when I got home. The base is lighter than the figures and putting on their pieces was nerve racking but I love all of them especially blondie's neck piece. Myethos' painting is great, like all the gold isn't out of line. Now I am thinking of a case that rotates.",

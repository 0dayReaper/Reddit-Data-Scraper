As for the stationery pieces, [they come separated](https://myfigurecollection.net/picture/2065454). I've heard horror stories of people receiving theirs with broken parts, however. Frankly the assembly was the most anxiety inducing part of all this, because the pieces are very frail and easy to break if you're not careful enough.",

Description:

A subreddit for the discussion of figures from anime, manga, and Japanese-style media.

Rules:

Do not promote illegal activity: Bootlegs are harmful to the industry, so we do not want to support them. Posts containing bootlegs, bootleg garage kits ("recasts"), or unlicensed figures, advocating for their purchase or links for purchasing them will be subject to removal. Discussion of customs or tax evasion are also not permitted.

If making a bootleg report, please note which item you think is not authentic, particularly in large group photos.

Unmarked NSFW: Posts containing figures, collections, or external links that primarily focus on NSFW aspects (pantsu, bikinis, nudity) should be marked with the appropriate flair. 
No sexual or suggestive content involving minors ("loli"s): Per [Reddit's content policy](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-sexual-or-suggestive).  
Do not use Reddit's in-comment image hosting for NSFW content.

Approved origins: Figures must come from one of the following origins: A Japanese series (manga, anime, visual novels, etc). Be an aesthetically "anime" figure produced by a Japanese manufacturer/company or from a manufacturer on the approved list.  
List of other approved sources: Myethos, Apex, MaxCute, Ribose, Mihoyo, Hobby Max, Vibrastar, Emontoys, Astrum Design, AniGift, DCTer, Snail Shell, AniMester, Party Look, Otherwhere, Solarain, Ensoutoys, Reverse Studio, Net Ease (this list may change).

Figure focused: The subreddit's primary topic is figures. Don't post low-effort or topic-derailing content. This includes but is not limited to: Memes, reaction images, photos of unopened shipping boxes, pre-order screenshots.  
Figures must be the primary subject of images, including collection photos.  
Tangential and/or off-topic discussions may be removed at our discretion.  
Discussions of the source anime should go to /r/anime or series-specific subreddits.  
AI-generated/assisted images are not allowed.

No solicitation: No "looking to buy" posts. You can ask for help finding an item online, but do not solicit other users or ask if anyone is selling. Please do not make sales offers to other users unless you have an active sale post.  
Do not post or ask for referral links in the subreddit (this includes Otaku Mode's invite links).  
Retailer social media: Direct marketing from retailer accounts is not allowed.

Don't spam: Excessive spam of news posts (or 'normal' non-news posts) over a short period of time will be removed.  
You can post reviews or link to your own blog, but do not use the subreddit only to promote your own social media. A high ratio of comments to the subreddit versus self-promoting links is recommended.  
Posts with very specific questions ("Should I buy Figure A or Figure B?") may be subject to removal after being answered.

Sale posts: All sale/trade posts must:

Include [Sale] or [Trade] in the title text.

Be submitted as text posts.

List the items and their prices in the body of the post.

Include links to verification photos showing the sale items alongside a piece of paper containing the seller's handwritten Reddit username and the current date.

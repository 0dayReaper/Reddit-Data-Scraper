I got them when they first released, best decision I ever made. I am still hoping beyond hope that Megahouse will give us Eiji to fit Ash, because that staircase-shootout scene totally had Eiji being protected by Ash in the manga.",

The scene with Ash sitting mirrors the picture Eiji took, but it's only really accurate if you got the bonus face (which I don't have). Props to the overall flow of the figure though, it's really well constructed and keeps your interest. It's just *not* worth the 700$+ the aftermarket asks.\n\nI'd love to see your display once your Ring Style Ash gets to you! =) Always enjoy seeing Banana Fish shrines.\n\nThey diiid. I was fortunate enough to pre-order the bonus smiling face one; Trigun Stampede was my favourite recent anime and all the other Vash figures are so hard to come by now. I gotta have him!",

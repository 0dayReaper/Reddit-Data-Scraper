It definitely wasn't there a few days ago when there were a few threads about it being gone but it seems to be back? \n\n[Here's a pic](https://i.imgur.com/4PeVAcu.png)",

Without the discount, they charge almost as much for shipping as DHL/EMS would be from a Japanese store (at least for me on the east coast. I know they're located on the west coast). But you get the item much later than a Japanese store (if it isn't already in-stock).\n\n\nUnless they have the pre-order discount (and base price is close to international one), or are having a really good sale going, it's generally not worth ordering with them. I got a [figma](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/724610) and a [nendoroid](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1347680) from them during their memorial day sale. It costed **$21** just to ship those two. I tested it by adding another figma before checkout, and it would have added another $7! Normally I wouldn't buy at that high of cost, but the two things were discounted enough (and one was GS exclusive) so it ended up being a little cheaper than anywhere else.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! I am selling some of my figures to\ud83d\udcb8pay bills and don't have room for them. I'm sorry if the images are out of order in the albums!! If you would like another picture of the figure, just ask in the comments! I will not open the Tohru figure box. DM me if you have any questions!\n\nI have \n\nBrand NEW! unopened\n\n- ($200 shipped) [Kobayashi-san chi no Maid Dragon S - Tohru - 1/7 - Maid Cafe Ver. (Apex Innovation)](https://imgur.com/a/NwYaKU9) Completely unopened and brand new\n\nUsed but basically brand new figures I've kept in boxes because of lack of space.\n \n- ($180 shipped) [FREEing Toradora! Taiga Aisaka Bunny Ver. 1/4](https://imgur.com/a/WxuppEN), I opened the box only to check on it, blister broken.\n\n- ($120 shipped) [Nekopara - Vanilla - 1/7 - Pretty Kitty Style (PLUM)](https://imgur.com/a/syoBVB4)\n\n- ($120 shipped) [Nekopara - Chocola - 1/7 - Pretty Kitty Style \n(PLUM)](https://imgur.com/a/wulS2bP)\n\n- if you buy both Vanilla and Chocola I'll give them to you for $200 since shipping them together is cheaper. \n\n\nEverything is sold AS IS, and I am not responsible for shipping damage, insurance is recommended if you want it to have peace of mind. You will have to notify and pay for this if you want it and thank you everyone for your time!! &lt;3",

You should be able to walk in and show the tracking number and your ID and they'll go to the back and get it for you.\n\nThey likely made a delivery attempt and you weren't home. Should have left a note on your door telling you where to go but sometimes they don't. If you leave it there too long it will be sent back to the sender. I don't know how long they hold it.\n\nThis happened to me this past weekend. Picked it up during lunch.",

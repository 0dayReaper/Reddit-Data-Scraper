            "comment": "Usually the best way is to work your way up in cleaners by how harsh they are. Dish soap in warm water with a cloth will clean up most surface level gunk. If that fails, try testing a small spot with alcohol on a cotton swab. Hydrogen peroxide would fall here, but I generally wouldn't recommend it. It can help with yellowing plastic, but generally it is more harsh than useful. The next harshest would be a magic eraser (or more specifically melamine foam), though it is not without risk, see below.\n\nBe aware that alcohol can dissolve paint from the surface as well as dirt, so use it sparingly. And a magic eraser is an abrasive, so you are basically sanding off the surface. This can ruin the paints finish and remove sealer, so it is basically a last resort when otherwise the figure looks like crap.",

Looking at [a reference photo](https://static.myfigurecollection.net/upload/pictures/2021/05/26/2729300.jpeg), it would appear there is significant yellowing. It is possible that warm lighting in the photo makes it look worse, but yellowing is usually nicotine or an issue with the paint manufacturing for figures of this age (2013 being the oldest).",

Imo, if it is a relatively common figure like this, there's no reason to settle for a damaged one if you aren't 100% feeling up to a repair project. You've got options.",

                    "comment": "As mentioned in my post, be careful about doing this. Magic Erasers are melamine foam, and it breaks apart as you use it, creating a micro abrasive. This absolutely will mar glossy paint and can remove sealers from matte paints. It's a useful tool to know of, but one I have never used on my figures. There are many less harsh options you should try before it.",

Its usually something they bought.  Giving away personal possessions is definitely something of a concern.\n\nThat said... if he happens to live in a major city like NYC where storage space is super limited... I could see people giving stuff away to other fans if they weren't able to find a buyer but still need the space.  I am having that issue myself. \n\nI used to be a big overwatch fan and kind of just had a big falling out with it.  I still enjoy the series thematically and I hope it continues to expand... but I've got limited storage space and a massive box filled with nendos and other figures that I haven't been able to find buyers for.  I may eventually just bite the bullet and mail them home so family can add to storage but damn will it be a pricey package to send since its so many figures.",

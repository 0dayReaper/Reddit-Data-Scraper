    "postText": "Hello all!!! I Preordered the figure Hatsune Miku Newly Written Illustration Ver. Prize Figure from Ukiyo Kumo and it still has not arrived. I ordered it in Sept, 2022. They keep pushing the release months back. I\u2019ve heard Ukiyo Kumo was reliable but\u2026 I want to know if anyone else is experiencing the same problems!",

            "comment": "US based retailers are infamously delayed in getting any kind of stock. generally speaking if you want a figure ASAP its best to purchase off jpn based stores such as TOM (japan based warehouse), amiami, good smile global, solaris japan, nin-nin game, etc.  as its a prize figure, [mandarake](https://order.mandarake.co.jp/order/?lang=en) would also probably have it at some point. (they get a lot of hatsune miku prize figures on a daily basis)\n\nafaik ukiyo kumo is one of the more delayed shops, too. BBTS has her in stock so i assume you won't be waiting that much longer as BBTS is also famous for being very, very slow to get stock.",

                            "comment": "it can be, but that's mostly for figures that are 1/7 scale and up. prize figures are generally small so shipping shouldn't be that expensive unless you're purchasing multiple at a time + shipping them together. \n\nyou can also look into surface shipping, which most jpn based retailers offer. you can read an article [here](https://support.hlj.com/hc/en-us/articles/900004509306-Surface-Parcel) about it if you'd like more info but its a pretty cheap way to get any parcel to your door. the trade off being it generally takes a few months to get from the store to you but if you're not in a rush its a good method. i've used it for over 50+ parcels and the most i've ever paid was 4k for a BINDing 1/4.",

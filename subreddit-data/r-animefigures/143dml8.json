Even though you got this boxless, 4500 Yen is a steal unless she's damaged somehow that the photos don't show. I personally have her and think she's great!",

I feel like it is a very fair deal for a figure without box, kinda amazed she was able to stay in good condition in a preowned store. ( O wait then I noticed it was in Japan haha)",

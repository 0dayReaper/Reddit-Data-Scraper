I\u2019ve gotten the \u201c120 Size\u201d box from AmiAmi 5 times so far and each time it has cost me 6472 yen exactly to ship.\n\nOf course DHL prices are subject to change and AmiAmi has other box sizes too, but you can guess the price range of the other sizes based on these.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT: Want to make a correction as some people pointed out, DHL prices are actually based on dimensional weight.**\n\nSince I only mostly get figures and they don't weight much to reach the minimum weight, DHL determines the dimensional weight by the volume of the package.\n\nSo you can expect similar prices if it's just a figure and nothing crazy heavy.",

No prior experience with Navito World but from a quick comparison it looks like buying from AmiAmi is cheaper.  \nNavito charges **269 CDN** for a Play Arts Kai Remake Sephiroth (not including shipping).  \nAmiAmi charges **\\~139 CDN** for the figure. If we slap on shipping and duties, that's another 80 dollars (and that's on the high end, chances are it will be lower than this). So from AmiAmi you're looking at **219 CDN** for the same figure.  \nBased on this comparison, you save 50 bucks from buying with AmiAmi ***and*** you get it shipped straight to your door.",

If an order would need a (presumably 160) at 21,430 JPY, then if they put it into two 140(a) then great, you save a bit, but if they end up in a 140(a) and 140(b) it's costing you more (9546 + 15000 = 24546 JPY). Similarly for the 140(b) - even if you can split them such that you'll get a 120 and 140(a) you'll be paying more (6472 + 9546 = 16018 JPY). You only win there if you end up with two 120s. Same looks like it follows all the way down - each tier of box is less expensive than combining the two previous tiers together, it's only less if splitting the shipment results in 2 boxes two sizes below the size they would be combined.",

    "postText": "As of the last few months I\u2019ve been ordering from AmiAmi for import figures. My biggest issue is I usually end up paying 2x the amount for the figure when it comes down to shipping. I wanted to ask if fellow Canadian collectors prefer Tokyo otaku mode or hobby Genkai for buying figures or if there is another website you recommend instead of AmiAmi",

            "comment": "I wouldn't personally recommend sites that charge in USD, which TOM currently does and Solaris will be doing soon. Besides, both stores ship from Japan so the shipping distance is still the same. \n\nI recommend GoodSmile Global for their flat 2k yen shipping with EMS, and Amazon JP, their DHL rates are actually pretty good and you pay tax upfront. Just be careful with Amazon JP, if it's not fulfilled by Amazon you have to watch for bootlegs",

            "comment": "it depends on what you're buying and what shipping method you choose. Surface Parcel probably cost me around 3,000-5,000 JPY. DHL might cost me 10,000 JPY. It also depends on the size of figure you're buying because the box size may also factor into the cost.\n\nI have never used Hobby Genkai but Tokyo Otaku mode use to be one I used, then they got too pricey for me. GoodSmile Global is another one with a flat rate shipping of 2,000 JPY.",

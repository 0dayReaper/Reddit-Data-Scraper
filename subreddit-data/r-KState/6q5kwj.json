Will it continue to grow? Will we be just as competitive, get better, or worse?\n\nIdk, what are your guys thoughts?",

I hope he chooses to come back to his alma mater. We need some star power to lure those recruits. With all improvements that have been made the facilities are there. The Cats need a Snyder guy Venables is the answer in my opinion. ",

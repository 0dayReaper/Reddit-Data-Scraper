It'll probably be decently busy.\n\nI imagine they'll be showing the game in the Union if you'd like to avoid going to a bar, but there won't be much of an atmosphere.  ",

There aren't a ton of people who are going to be in MHK on that date, so I doubt any large number of places are even going to be open. Any that are will be trying to break even for the dead time that the break is for their business, so it'll probably be pretty much only bars/restaurants (especially the ones in aggieville since they're so actively pro-ksu).",

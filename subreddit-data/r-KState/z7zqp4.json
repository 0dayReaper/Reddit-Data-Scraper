    "postText": "K-State Alum here...so, when I attended K-State, Lafene was on campus (near Hale Library and Seaton, where the English Dept. is now.  \\[Ironically, the English Dept. was near Hale in the now demolished Denison Hall, but I digress)\\].  I understand that in '96, Memorial Hospital vacated their building at Claflin Rd. and Sunset Ave. and moved elsewhere.  Lafene moved to the old Memorial Hospital building.  That got me wondering -- what the heck does Lafene do with all that space? -- I know that they don't do operations -- what happened to the old operating rooms (and even more fascinating, the morgue)?  What about patient rooms as this was a full functioning and working hospital throughout the 90s.  I mean, Lafene was tiny when I attended K-State so they definitely needed more room, but heck -- this would be like moving from a travel trailer to a mansion.  Anyone have any inside information?",

As I remember, the patient rooms were used as exam rooms, there was a full pharmacy, x-rays, a lab, a casting area where I had a removable purple plastic cast made for a broken hand, an area for PT, and lots of offices. I'm not sure about the morgue, though- that's a great question!",

When it first opened there seamed to be other health care \u201centities\u201d in the lower west side floors.  \n\nMy one time there I remember seeing RCPD escorting an individual that was restrained to a gurney and in a hospital gown to the lower west side floors. Now that was 15 years ago so again, I could be totally wrong.",

I had a sleep study done there years ago.\n\n\nI was actually one of the last patients who was there when it was Memorial Hospital in the 90s. I was 8 and caught salmonella and had to be on IV fluids for several days to prevent me from dying. They were already starting to dismantle the hospital when I was checked in.",

            "comment": "Gotta tell you that the neatest part of the original Lafene design was the tile floors - they had colored lines that you followed to get to various parts of the building.  The nurse (or other staff) would just say \"follow the green line to the Pharmacy\" and you looked down on the floor and (as long as they got you going in the right direction), you got to where you were going.  It was the best example of great wayfinding I've seen.  I assume that the new Lafene does not have this functionality...wonder if they kept those lines on the floor in the English Building (does this building have a name???).",

They have CAPS (counseling in the basement) at least part of it, there's sports med, physical therapy, x-ray, lab, an ER, pharmacy, a wellness center (that I think has therapy dogs most days), there's a massage therapist...and that's all outside the normal physicians they have as well. \n\nI had heard horror stories from my Wife whose an Alum so I was hesitant to check it out at first, but it's actually a very very nice facility and I've had nothing but positive experiences with the providers I've seen.",

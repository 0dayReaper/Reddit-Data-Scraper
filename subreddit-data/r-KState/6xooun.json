I have only met one person with a connection to KState, and that was at the airport where this dude was picking up his son coming home for winter break. I'm sure they're out there... I've just never seen them.\n\nIf you have any questions about Cleveland, I've lived there all my life besides for grad school at KState. Feel free to reach out!\n\nEMAW",

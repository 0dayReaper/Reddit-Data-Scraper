Do you guys have anything like that because I want to tailgate but don't want to have to bring all of my stuff up there to do it.\n\nAny help would be great and I am looking forward to see what the atmosphere is like there!  It should be an exciting game.",

I'm hopeful we have a good atmosphere despite getting our ass kicked week in and week out. Most people are pretty friendly and will gladly crack a beer with you. Have a good time!",

I think that practice by RCPD has gone away. \n\nIf you\u2019re walking to someone else\u2019s tailgate, carrying around a case shouldn\u2019t be an issue. In most instances, if you aren\u2019t being an idiot they aren\u2019t going to bother you. ",

It used to be against the rules to have alcohol in any of the tailgating lots, so you had to hide it/pour it in a cup. \n\nNow you are free to have booze as long as your over 21. You can walk around with cans or bottles of whatever you want.",

People are dismissed by law enforcement all the time.  I personally tried to report two different thefts and was turned away. No report filed. And before we got together my wife tried to report someone assaulting her and no report was filed. \n\nBad things can happen to anyone and just because they happen to be black doesn't mean the thing happened because they are black.",

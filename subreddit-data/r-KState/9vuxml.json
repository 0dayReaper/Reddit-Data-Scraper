    "postText": "hey!!\n\nI am currently finishing up my undergrad in international relations (in the Netherlands, actually, but i'm from the US originally) and I want to be marginally closer to my family (in Indiana, but a three-state buffer is honestly kinda ideal) for my masters. the security studies program seems pretty promising from what I've read so far but I'd love some first-hand accounts of what the faculty's like!\n\nmy personal academic interests in the field are kinda niche/heterodox (the media-security nexus, use of language and narrativity in shaping perceptions of security practice and policy), but i'm not against more \"traditional\" security studies shit by any means ;)\n\nso basically: what's the general vibe like at the faculty, if anyone's familiar? at the university as a whole and at the graduate level? is there anywhere in town i can get a good malt milkshake?",

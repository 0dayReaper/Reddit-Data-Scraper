I taught courses on race/class/gender/orientation to first year students during that time. I have a pretty  good idea how many people at K-State will respond. Is K-State the backwoods school that people in Lawrence paint it as, no. Is it a bastion of acceptance, no. The truth is somewhere between the two. \n\nI will say this, if you had been around when we were fighting for the LGTBQ resource center you might be singing a completely different tune. ",

But it also opens up the opportunity for people like this to crack jokes at the same time. my stance is that it is unnecessary to broadcast these things because imo it does more harm than good, but Im not a gay athlete so Idk. maybe it would be good to have the player's opinion on their sexuality being newsworthy ",

Most of my professors were great, they make it fairly easy to succeed if you put the work in.

            "comment": "Hi! I am a fairly recent graudate of the business school (along with a major and some other concentrations outside of business)! To be truthful, I did very well in classes and was pretty accomplished (super high grades, involved in qutie a few things, had related work experiences), but never really felt like I \"fit\" in the cba and would be totally lying if I said I found most classes engaging. Because I never really enjoyed most of my classes, I can't say I was ever super happy with my choice, but don't let that color your view too much - alot of that was a fit issue and is really on me for not taking the time I needed to discover what I wanted to do before it was pretty much too late to change my major. On a semi-related note, I work outside of the standard business spheres now.\n\nIn general, you can get a business degree (especially in general or HR management or marketing) with very little difficulty. I was in marketing, and honestly, I'm pretty sure if you have a basic sense of logic you can graduate in that major, maybe even with decent grades. Only a few classes (usually finance and accounting, and sometimes economics) can be a bit more difficult, but you can usually manipulate your schedule each semester to help balance out your workload if needed. That said, I do think that business majors have more demanding extra-cirrucular schedules than outsiders probably realize; if you actually want a business career after graduation, you will have lots of competition from high-achieving graduates with excellent grades, work/internship experience, and who have spent lots of time to make sure they are well-presented to recruiters in their target companies or industries. Because typical \"business major\" career paths are really competitive, don't totally let the easy classes make you complacent if you are serious about landing a good role out of school.\n\nAs for the people, it's K-State, so everyone is pretty nice. Most of the professors are pretty reasonable and approachable. Just check Rate My Professor and maybe talk to a few friends to dodge the bullets you can in terms of unnessecarily hard professors. Most of the students in the business school are involved in greek life, so it can be hard to integrate and make friends with classmates if you aren't involved in that part of campus, but again, most are still reasonably nice. The business school also has resources in the career center, which can be  helpful, as long as you are proactive about pursuing those opportunities.\n\nSorry for the super long post-hopefully this helps some!",

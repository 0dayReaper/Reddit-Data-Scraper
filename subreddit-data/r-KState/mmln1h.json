I studied in that room through my time in Manhattan and would love to add one to my office. Doesn\u2019t have to be one of the four, but I\u2019d love to have something by him.",

The order form is from 2014 and is pretty outdated but may get you in contact with the person in charge of the official print photographs. Best of luck",

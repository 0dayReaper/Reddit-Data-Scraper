I'm not sure what secrets a picture of a dark and damp data center could hold but that's above my pay grade I guess.\n\nFrom what I gather, a majority of the books escaped direct dousing but as they sat in 100&amp;#37; humidity for several days they soaked up moisture from the air. Everything is being moved out by the restoration company and frozen to arrest mold growth and await further processing.",

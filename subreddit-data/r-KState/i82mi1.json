    "postText": "I am in search of a relet for my apartment starting **ASAP**.\n\nI can tell you a little bit about the apartment complex.  The name is the Gramercy Apartments located at 2215 College Ave. Manhattan, Kansas 66502.  It\u2019s located just a walking distance away from the football stadium. My current rent rate is $408 and my lease ends on **July 31, 2021.**  You will be responsible for electricity and water (IF OVER THE $30.00 ALLOTTED AMOUNT). I'm unsure of The average for electricity as I am moving out before I've moved in. The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable, and internet.  Another great thing about reletting is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my relet and you can move into **any** apartment within the complex. \n\nIf you are interested, please contact me at 620-615-2371**. Or** you can contact Rachel **rmeyer@clsliving.com** if you are concerned with authenticity. If you would like to set up a tour or have any additional questions you can contact a Leasing Professional at 785-539-0500.\n\n**If you are interested, I'd love to work out something where I'd pay something every month or so.**",

    "postText": "So this is my first year at K-State, and when I spoke to the financial aid office on Wednesday they said my aid was going to be disbursed on Friday. At my last school we would get an email and our bill would update the same day our financial aid paid, but so far I have no email nor has my bill updated. I guess I am just worried something is wrong, and since there are no weekend hours I can\u2019t call. For students who have been here a while, is this normal?",

I\u2019ll assume that it\u2019s this week but you can always call on Monday to check. \n\nI hope you have a great freshmen year. What\u2019s your major? :)",

The housekeepers came everyday to clean (except weekends) which was WAY more than I probably would have cleaned myself. I have also heard horror stories about gross roommates in suites and I\u2019m SO glad I never had to clean someone\u2019s vomit \ud83e\udd22",

We had shit in a shower, puke in the sink etc happen on Friday nights a few times and you get the joy of it sitting there until Monday.\n\nOther than that, it\u2019s great. I\u2019d wear sandals when showering though.",

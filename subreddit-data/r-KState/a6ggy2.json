            "comment": "Backstory: In 2015, the marching band did a Star Trek themed performance at the halftime of a football game and they assumed a formation where the USS Enterprise encounters a Jayhawk in space, described by the announcer as \"a terrifying space creature\". As the formation moved, it looked for all the world like the Jayhawk was eating a dick.\n\nIt was conclusively proven to be accidental when a band member posted their formation grid papers clearly showing that the Jayhawk was never meant to be shown eating a dick. It was just an unfortunate accidental consequence of how the people had to move on the field. Plus watching a video of the performance, you don't even see the dick. It moves by so fast and you only see it if you pause the video and watch it frame-by-frame.\n\nBut the damage was done and people on /r/kansas and /r/cfb still remember it as being deliberate. I've gotten hundreds of downvotes for trying to explain this to the world, but it's hopeless. People can't even get it through their skulls that they were doing a Star Trek themed performance, so \"it was supposed to be the USS Enterprise\" sounds like a cop out to them.",

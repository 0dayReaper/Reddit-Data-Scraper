Transfer credits won\u2019t show up with a grade on your transcript, so all you need to do is get a C to pass.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m assuming your some sort of engineering/math/physics major who needs to take Calc 3. Don\u2019t be discouraged by Calc 2 because Calc 3 is much easier to grasp. \n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to dm me!",

            "comment": "I had U-verse and it was a lot more expensive than my current price with COX.  The internet was also very spotty; the connection would commonly flicker off for a moment and it was enough to disturb gaming/streaming/downloads.  \n\n$65 a month right now with COX for basic cable plus HBO and internet.  And COX doesn't make you rent their gear which is nice, was easy to set up with my own modem and router.  So far no complaints and hella cheaper than AT&amp;T.",

How's the rockwall at the Recreation Center \"Rec?\" Would it be worth the $5 guest passes for all of us when we visit?",

All staff members are PCIA certified and very happy to see new climbers coming in.  I highly recommend it.  I haven't been back in a while, but historically, there was very good route setting for a gym in Kansas.  ",

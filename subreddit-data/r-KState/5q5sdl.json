            "comment": "Hey! Made a throwaway for this. I know its a pretty decisive topic and I hope we can really discuss this. College is a forum for different ideas and topics to be debated and talked about so we all grow. My opinions on this are by no means final, but they are strong. As a result, since the internet is forever- I made a throwaway. Someone might eventually be able to figure out who I am but in the meantime I'd like to have some back and forth and feedback while I form my opinions. If you read all the way through this, kudos to you... I'll try to be (somewhat brief) and I will read all of your responses and try to respond thoughtfully as well.\n\n______________\n\nSome background for me so you know where I am coming from:\n\n- I am a recent graduate\n\n- Every house (not dorm, fraternity, or apartment) I lived in had a gun for self defense if necessary. It never was, thank goodness.\n\n- I am registered Republican (sorry Brownback did not vote for you though), and do consider guns a right, but not one that you can't put any type of restriction on (which technically puts me at odds with the state party) I haven't been hunting but have shot several types of guns, went to the range about a month(?) ago just shooting with a friend for fun and dropped way too much money. If you've never been you don't know how expensive it is just to shoot around...\n\n- I *have* seen what an accidental gun death can do however. Its not something that really directly affected my experiences, but full disclosure..\n\nSo here we go.\n\n_______\n\nI think as a practical matter this is an issue best left to the Universities. If they want conceal carry, allow it. But the rub is that none do. So lets break this down then. I want most University policy set by the University unless policy is deficient- then I want the state to step in. In no way did I feel like my safety was deficient and that carrying a gun would allow for me to better defend myself. As far as I could tell in every instance where students were in some kind of danger that warranted immediate and swift action the Campus and Riley police were on it immediately. Also, as far as I can tell there have not been any campus instances nationally where conceal carry helped in a similar situation, but it seems like there have been cases where it has led to negative situations. (This is where y'all present articles and facts disproving what I'm saying).\n\nLets look at what the University President, and onetime highest ranking military official in the United States of America has to say:\n\n&gt; \"I still think it\u2019s not a good idea for campus. I\u2019d be a lot better with it if they said you had to have some sort of training, because in the military we give people weapons, but we train them on how to use those weapons.\u201d\n\nThis is partly an issue with the current concealed carry laws (another debate for another time) but it raises a good point. If you believe that guns are allowed to better protect the whole of campus then you are downright wrong. I see no way that individuals carrying will be better equipped to respond to a threat than police that are specifically trained and have protocols for such circumstances. \n\nConsider this scenario: a potential or active shooter is identified on campus. Dozens of upright, law abiding K-Staters are concealed carrying and hear about this while on campus. Before, police knew that NOBODY is allowed to carry a gun but themselves. Anyone carrying a gun could be the threat and everyone else knows this. Now, anyone carrying a gun could be a citizen attempting to contribute. And if you are one of the students trying to help, how do you know who is another legal concealed carrier and who is the shooter? If you're a student how do you know the difference? This makes things much harder and much more dangerous for the professionals tasked with carrying out our protection.\n\nThe basis for the concealed carry on campus law is not the protection of the whole-if it is that's a flawed notion- it is for the right of the individual to protect themselves. But the right to bear arms is not for individual protection. That is afforded under the right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of happiness. However, the right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness is infringed upon by individuals creating needlessly dangerous situations on campus by bringing their guns. (Alright jump on me here and tell me how I am wrong.)\n\nThe fact is, concealed carriers are on the massive, massive whole law abiding and very good people. I know a *lot* of them. Could someone bring a gun onto campus and nobody know? Yes, and it has probably happened. But this law doesn't just make something that could theoretically be done into a practicality, it has many ramifications. Do not treat it as a legalization of the status quo, whichever side you are on, because it isn't.\n\n____________\n\nTL;DR\n\nThis is best left to the professionals if you are trying to keep the populace safe. If you are concerned about individual rights, you are infringing on the rights of more people than those you are protecting.",

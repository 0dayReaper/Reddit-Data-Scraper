    "postText": "Hello\n\nI will be recruiting at the career fair on Sep 22. I will be flying in from out of state and landing late.  I wanted to know if there were Uber, Lyft, or taxi's after 10 PM on weekdays? \n\nAlso I'll be recruiting STEM majors but wanted to get some feedback on how I can ease this for y'all.  If there are any suggestions for me please comment.",

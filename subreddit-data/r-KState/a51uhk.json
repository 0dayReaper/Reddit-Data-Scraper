NDSU gets the top tier FCS athletes, and their recruiting has some easy sells (multiple championships in a row, facilities, fan base).  It's tough to recruit to KSU, and we aren't going to have better athletes than everyone else.  That being said, you can make that argument for the other candidates.  Hopefully he has all the success in the world, we're all in this together!",

Everybody outside of K-State seems to think it's an outstanding hire, I feel like KSU fans are just constantly in a state of needing something to bitch about. Yes, hiring Andy Reid or Bill Belichick would have been ideal. I just don't think there were any candidates that were noticeably better than Klieman. Gotta give the guy a chance. It should also be noted he coached Carson Wentz at NDSU.",

He was my favorite pick after Litrell dropped out. All I'm saying is that it's difficult to judge a coach's abilities at a FBS D1 level from his work in the FCS.\n\nLet's not forget that the last time KSU played NDSU, K-State Lost.",

Instead the AD just went out and hired his buddy from his last job. That\u2019s a fine way to go about things, but at least be honest about it. ",

It can also allow the school time to negotiate a more favorable agreement (though that doesn't seem to be the case here).",

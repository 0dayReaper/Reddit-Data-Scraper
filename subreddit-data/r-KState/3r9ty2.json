    "postText": "Last night many bikes were stolen on campus. It seems to only have been bikes that were not registered and were locked with cables, which were cut through. If your bike was registered (with the sticker visible) or locked with a U-Lock, it is likely still safe. If your bike was stolen, make sure to file a police report as soon as possible. ",

            "comment": "I hope the people who had their bikes stolen can get them back.\n\nTo briefly add to this PSA -- the number of people I see improperly locking up relatively expensive (a few hundred dollars or more) bikes around campus is really sad. For anyone who isn't familiar about how to properly lock a bike, the two most important fundamental points are:\n\n(a) Don't rely on cable locks as a primary method of securing bikes. Cheaper cable locks (the most common ones around campus) can be cut in a few seconds with household wire cutters, and a cheap pair of bolt cutters from Walmart can easily cut the rest. If you care about your bike, spend the $30-40ish to get a basic u-lock from an actual security company.\n\n(b) Properly locking your bike with a u-lock is really easy. The simplest way to lock your bike for a lower theft risk area like MHK is to lock the rear wheel to a rack through the frame's rear triangle, as in http://www.sheldonbrown.com/images/locktechnique1.jpg, or to lock both the rear wheel and frame to a rack.",

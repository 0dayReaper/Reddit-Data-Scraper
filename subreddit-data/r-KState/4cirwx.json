    "postText": "Hey fellow Wildcats! I have a dilemma that I hope someone here might have an answer for. I can't imagine that it is a terribly uncommon occurrence to have a significant other who goes to a different university, but wanting to bring them to the games! \n\nWell, that is the issue I have right now. I would like to buy a GA, or even ICAT ticket to the football and basketball games, but want to be able to bring her to the games with me! Of course I could buy someone else's ticket on a per-game-basis, but that is against the rules, and I don't think I want to risk it for Every. Single. Game.\n\nSo Wildcats! I must ask you this! Is there a way to get a second GA or ICAT pass for her to be able to attend? She goes to KWU in Salina.",

Here's what my plan would be -\n\nHave a friend who doesn't buy tickets already to buy an ICAT ticket for you to use every game and then \"lose\" your current ID and get a new one made. She can use your ID and your 2nd ticket for every game. ",

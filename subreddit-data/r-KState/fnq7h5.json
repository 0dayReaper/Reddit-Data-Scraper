Not just because of his obvious bias, but also the fact that \"health benefits of herbs spices\" is far out there enough that my bullshit alarm bells are going off.\n\nI really think this is the worst time to be spreading this kind of potentially false information. Even if one person chooses to forgo proven medicine in lieu of \"herbs and spices\", you've done a great disservice to public health as a direct result of putting this out there.",

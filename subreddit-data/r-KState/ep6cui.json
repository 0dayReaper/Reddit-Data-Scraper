    "postText": "Hey everyone!! I am currently looking for a subleaser for my apartment as I am currently in the process of moving back home. I live at The Gramercy Apartments. The Gramercy Apartments located at 2215 College Ave. Manhattan, Kansas 66502. It\u2019s located just a walking distance away from the football stadium. \n\nMy current rent rate is $399.00 and my lease ends on July 31st, 2020. You will be responsible for electricity and water (IF OVER THE $30.00 ALOTTED AMOUNT). The average for electricity is about $45.00 - $50.00 per month. The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable, and internet. Another great thing about reletting is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my relet and you can move into any apartment within the complex. \n\nAdditionally, January rent is paid for already and I WILL PAY YOUR February rent in the amount of $399. All you have to do is pay for electricity and water. If you are interested, please contact myself (Deylin) at 702-856-9636. You may text or call me. If you would like to set up a tour or have any additional questions you can contact Sa\u2019Sha Moore at the Gramercy at 785-539-0500.",

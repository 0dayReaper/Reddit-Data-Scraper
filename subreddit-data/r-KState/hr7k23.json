    "postText": "  \n\nI am in search of a relet for a FURNISHED apartment starting August 1, 2020. **I WILL PAY YOUR FIRST MONTH\u2019S RENT &amp; APPLICATION FEE!!!** \n\nI can tell you a little bit about the apartment complex. The name is the Gramercy Apartments located at 2215 College Ave. Manhattan, Kansas 66502. It\u2019s located just a walking distance away from the football stadium. My current rent rate is $399.00 for a 4-bedroom unit (you can relet for a 2-bedroom unit for $529.00 a month) and my lease ends on July, 31st 2021. You will be responsible for electricity and water (IF OVER THE $30.00 ALOTTED AMOUNT). The average for electricity is about ($60.00-65.00) per month. The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable, internet, pool access, gym, and tanning bed. Another great thing about reletting is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my relet and you can move into any apartment within the complex! Please contact me at [Tnickelson50@gmail.com](mailto:Tnickelson50@gmail.com) or 970-301-5368 for the details and contact information for the Gramercy, to make this your new home!\n\nPool: Check!\n\nGym: Check!\n\nVolleyball: Check!\n\nGrill: Check!\n\nFree Internet &amp; Cable: Check!\n\nCoffee: Check!\n\nPrinting: Check!",

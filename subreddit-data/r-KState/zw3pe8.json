    "postText": "I\u2019ve been completely spoiled living in an area that has fiber optic internet. I see that a decent chunk of Manhattan has fiber optic, but not the whole town. The AT&amp;T website makes it hard to do an address lookup for an apartment, because they ask for a unit number. So I figured I would jump on here to see if folks could confirm which apartment complexes have AT&amp;T fiber.",

            "comment": "Recent former dorm RA here. Moving in early is fairly common. The main reason to pay for it is to avoid the crowds on regular move-in day. That's up to you, I personally don't think it's worth it.\n\nHaving guests is allowed regardless of gender with permission of your roommate. They just can't stay more than 2 consecutive nights, that was the rule 3 years ago, at least.\n\nI'm from far out of state and didn't have a car my freshman year while living on campus. I didn't have any problems. Most places you'd need to go are walkable, and I could easily tag along with friends who had cars to the store etc. anyway. Possibly unpopular opinion, but as a freshman, I was kinda glad I didn't have to bother with parking the car and stuff because freshmen get pretty bad parking passes.\n\nI worked at the library IT Help Desk and it was a great job. If you're even slightly computer savvy, it pays well and is a solid resume builder. The colleges of business and engineering have their own help desk people also. If you bring a car; off campus I'd suggest looking at Target. Pays 15/hr It's pretty fun, and they're flexible with schedules.\n\nGood luck! I hope you love your time at K-State as much as I did :)",

Some of them existed but it was the minority, they've done a better job hiring RAs that match the diversity of the student population. My interests/major/beliefs are probably not that of a stereotypical RA lol. \n\nHilarious so I'll share; one of the few STUMO RAs my second year gave a presentation at our training (that was supposed to be about our identity) about how Christians are now \"persecuted\" and ignored on campuses. She literally used the phrase \"silenced majority\". So cringe, everyone was just shocked.",

Check with your roommate first - don\u2019t alienate the person you\u2019re stuck in a small room with. \n\n3. As a freshman you don\u2019t need a car, especially in the age of Ubers and those rentable scooters\n\n4. I worked in the Union at Caribou but they did a big overhaul and now there\u2019s a Radina\u2019s. I liked working in the Union - met a lot of people, if I worked enough hours in a day got a free meal, and I got free coffee because I worked at a coffee shop. It was closed on Sundays and over breaks like Christmas.\n\nI went 2007 to 2011 so no guarantee things are the same. It was a big deal when Olive Garden first opened and now the town has exploded.",

Plus, the first day rush is kinda fun.\n\n2:  Yeah easy, if your roommate doesn't care nobody will catch you. Be respectful though!\n\n3: I didn't have a car my freshman year and it wasn't that big of a deal. I worked off-campus and just walked/biked. Kept me in great shape! Manhattan is small enough of a town that the only place that you /need/ a car to go is the grocery store. I just got friends to go with me!\n\n4: I worked a few different jobs when I was in the dorms. I worked at a bookstore off-campus that I really liked, but it was about a mile walk. There's also a ton of on-campus jobs that are closer and will cooperate with your classes a little better. I might recommend the Staley School of Leadership for on-campus jobs.",

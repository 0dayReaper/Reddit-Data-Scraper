    "postText": "Hi all!  I\u2019m a first year teacher teaching middle school math in Lawrence (no hate, I went to Emporia for undergrad!).  My bachelor\u2019s is elementary ed, so I\u2019m looking for grad programs specifically for math teachers to help me be a better teacher.  K-State seems to be one of the only schools that offers a masters emphasis in mathematics, and it\u2019s online!\n\nSo I would love to hear your experiences!  The good, the bad, and the ugly.  I\u2019d even love to hear from education undergrad majors and grad students in other online programs.  Whatever you can give me is appreciated!",

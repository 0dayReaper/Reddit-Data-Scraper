            "comment": "&gt;Eric Taylor Coach of the Week \u2013 Bill Snyder (Kansas State)\nIf K-State wins by 56, Bill Snyder wins the Golden Bench. Those are the rules. The Wildcats may not win many games in the Big 12 this year (or they might, I honestly can\u2019t tell if any team is good anymore), but Coach Snyder will still have nice things to say about his team no matter what happens. Stay golden, Bill Snyder.\n\nOn the one hand, his history pretty much earns him this award once a season. On the other, it's pretty obvious that they want to get it out of the way early in the season, while the games are less significant.",

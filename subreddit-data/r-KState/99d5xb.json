    "postText": "Hey there, I\u2019m Alex Van Dyke. I\u2019ve lived in Kansas my whole life, and in Manhattan for the past 10 years, including my years at K-State.\n\nI\u2019m running as a Democrat and the only general election challenger the current KS67 representative has had in the past three election cycles. I\u2019m going to do an AMA on r/littleapple from 7 to 9 p.m. Monday, Aug. 27, if you want to drop by and learn more about what I stand for.\n\nI want to bring Kansas into a safe and inclusive future -- a future where our children are protected and surrounded by love and acceptance for all. A future where Kansas is a shining example of education, healthcare, and inclusion for the rest of the country, motivating companies and jobs to move into the state. My main platforms are fully funding education, establishing equal pay, passing equitable taxes, and expanding Medicaid.\n\nIf you want to learn more about me in the meantime, [check out my website](https://www.vandykeforkansas.com) and my answers to voter guides for The Wichita Eagle, Trust Women, and the League of Women Voters. If you like what you read about my positions, it sure would help a lot if you could [donate money or time to my campaign](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/vandykeforkansas). But more important than anything: Be a voter this November. Check your registration and voting opportunities",

    "postText": "So considering a job at the university. One of the perks is the \"Dependent/Spouse Tuition Grant Program\" . Anyone have experience with ? So your kids get a grant or discounted tuition? How big a benefit is it? Sounds like 7 credit hours per semester covered, which in today dollar is I think about $2200 Per semester. So if average tuition $10K per year, 4 years-$40K. $17.6K in grant from employee program. So about half off ?? Sound right? any first hand experiences? TIA",

            "comment": "I think your math sounds right but I\u2019m not 100% sure. The program can also be used on graduate credits (though not as many a semester). The one catch is that if you\u2019re a term employee, you have to work at the university for 5 years before it becomes part of your benefits package \u2014 I believe the only way to find out if you\u2019re term or regular is to ask.",

It does increase as the cost of a credit hour increases. This doesn't take into account fees, which for engineering was an extra $100 per credit hour, but still a great blessing.",

No Texas recruiting ties makes me nervous as well.  \n\nVenables is a pipe dream and obviously my first choice, but I think Leavitt is the best hire, here. I think making a safe bet for the person to follow Bill is the best way to go. Leavitt can prove that someone, ANYONE, else can succeed here, and when he is ready to retire in 5 years (he's 62), we'll be in better shape for the next hire.",

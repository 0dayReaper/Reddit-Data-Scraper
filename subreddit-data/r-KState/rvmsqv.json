    "postText": "\n\nHello, I have been looking through this Reddit the past couple of weeks and have found a lot of useful information but still had some questions of my own. I am from Minnesota and am almost ready to put money down for K-State but still have a few questions. \n\n1. I am a Agronomy major, can anyone speak to this program or College of Ag itself and explain their experience and how competitive student are with jobs/ internships? Does anyone know if there is a minor/ major that would include either plant genetics or environmental science along with agricultural studies?\n\n2. I am interested in joining a fraternity next year and wondering what kind of reputation fraternities have on campus and, if any, what fraternities are not insane with partying and have good reps around campus. \n\n3. I have seen online that there are a lot of out of state students who attend K-State. Can someone speak to if this is true or is it a good mix of in and out of state or is it just becoming overrun by out of state rich kids. \n\n4. Do a lot of kids go home on the weekends or is there a lot of kids who stay and is there fun things to do in and around campus/Manhattan?\n\nI know everyone doesn't have an answer to every question but if you're able to contribute a little bit that would be super helpful. Thank You!",

            "comment": "College of Ag is great! They've won 18 of the last 21 national crop judging competitions. The competition for internship would probably be more for local KS/MO jobs/internships but probably won't have near the competition in your home state.\n\nAlpha Gamma Rho and Farm House are two predominantly Ag fraternities. They're both &lt;10 minute walks from campus. When I was in school farm house had this highest average GPA across all houses. They're a lot of fraternities at KSU. Some ARE better than others as a whole, but they go through ups and downs like any other group. You really have to find what and who works for and with you. \n\nI love Manhattan, Kansas. The Land, the food, the community, the University. It's a very special place.",

Fraternities, in my view, have always been pretty much party houses, with the exception of Farm House. Not that there aren't serious students in every house, but on the whole.\n3. Not an issue. Yes, there are a lot of out of state students. Would you know it without specifically asking people? No. The snobs go elsewhere.\n4. Most people stay around on weekends. Manhattan isn't a major metro area, but it is a college town, and so the area caters to the college crowd.\n\nYou really should come for a visit to get a feel of the vibe.",

            "comment": "Freshman here, I can give you a few thoughts\n\n1. N/A\n\n2. It definitely depends on the fraternity. As a pretty large school, if a fraternity it\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in I\u2019m sure you could find one that fits what you\u2019re looking for. Currently, the only fraternity that has a pretty universal bad reputation is sig ep, but everyone has their own opinions. You can\u2019t really generalize everyone in a certain frat. \n\n3. There are a good amount of in state kids, however the university is trying to recruit more out of state and it has worked in recent years. Personally, I\u2019m from Missouri and have met several people from out of state. Hell, one of my good friends is from San Diego. Right now, it feels like a majority of in state kids but with a fair dose of out of state.\n\n4. Kids really only go home on weekends if it\u2019s at least a 3 day weekend and they live within a couple of hours. This semester there was only one weekend where it kinda felt dead because of fall break and I didn\u2019t think it was worth it to go home.",

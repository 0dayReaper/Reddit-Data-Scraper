Multiple companies can hold the same trademark and often do. It only becomes a violation when an earlier company can prove that a latter company is producing merchandise that could create confusion in the marketplace.\n\nAnd no, K-State can't sue him for having his picture taken in front of their sign. It's public property.\n\nI hope you learned more about biology than you apparently did about how trademarks work.",

I took it as he was thinking he would have a profitable firm at 35 (as a look-at-me-i-did-it-young viewpoint), not in a holy shit I won't be profitable until I'm 35.  It's been a long while since I've read things out of the Collegian.  My apologies sir/madam.  ",

And since his new company caters to people who aren't going to give a shit about people insulting college, I'd say he's doing pretty well for himself.",

An already established company, with diverse lines of clothing and accessories can afford to go after a niche market like EDM festivals but a company that is ONLY going for that won't last a year.",

    "postText": "UC Irvine is a pretty tough first round draw, and Wade may miss the game with his foot injury. We've played well without Wade at times in the past, but certainly we're better and more well rounded with him healthy and in the lineup. I still have us reaching the Sweet 16 at least. Takes?",

I think we could go on a run similar to last year, so I kinda like everybody doubting us again and expecting us to get upset",

Now that we\u2019ve been tabbed as a solid potential upset, there will be a ton of Irvine fans showing up. I would imagine a home court feeling for UC Irvine.\n\nAt then end of the day, these teams aren\u2019t to different. Both play good defense, both have upperclassmen leadership. We have the overall better defense, but UC Irvine is better at protecting the rim. This could really hurt Makol Mawien. \n\nOverall, if we have Dean Wade, I\u2019d say we\u2019ll have the win. If not, it still leans our way but UC Irvine can definitely win.\n\nIt will definitely be a great game though. ",

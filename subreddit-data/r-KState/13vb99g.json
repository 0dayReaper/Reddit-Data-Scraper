    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am writing this post as I am wanting to gather some information as it pertains to best bars on campuses around the nation to create a website so college football fans know where the best bars are at for their favorite college football team.\n\nBelow are some questions I am looking for a response?\n\nBest pregame bar before Kansas State football games? Why is it the best pregame bar?\n\nBest bar to watch Kansas State football games? Why is it the best watch party bar?\n\nBest postgame bar after Kansas State football games? Why is it the best post game bar?\n\nAny information is extremely helpful and appreciated. I can\u2019t wait to see some of the responses.\n\nThank you",

Was there a better block in the 90s than Auntie Mae's, Hibachi Hut and briefly the Eclipse coffee shop that sat on the corner of 12th and Moro?",

(I HAVE walked it post-game, it sucks after an L but I great after a W)\n\nFor away games: I always liked watching games at Kites but I\u2019m sure folks are partial to whatever their favorite non-gameday bars are too.",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I go to Georgia Southern and play Collegiate Call of Duty. We're looking to expand to more schools entering the Black Ops 4 season starting in Jan and currently 3 members from KSU are in our discord and league and are having problems finding teammates. Can someone point us in the direction of the esports club? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll also link the College COD discord in case anyone is interested! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!!

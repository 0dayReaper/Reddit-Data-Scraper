Another funny tidbit is where it mentions his \u201cAmerica First\u201d group he tried to organize at KSU never became a recognized organization at the school because it failed to meet the minimum requirement of having 5 members. Lololol. What a pathetic little loser. Also I know people who know him. Throughout all of this he wasn\u2019t even in or anywhere close to Manhattan or actually attending classes on-campus because he\u2019s a little coward and knows he\u2019s despised in MHK and just hides playing video games and cowers behind his sad parade of brain dead little internet minions he sics on people who remind him of what a scumbag he is.",

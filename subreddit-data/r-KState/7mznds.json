There's active [LGBTQ] (http://www.k-state.edu/lgbt/) groups. Counseling services has dedicated [LGBTQ and trans-specific] (https://www.k-state.edu/counseling/student/group.html) group therapy sessions. The LGBTQ community in Manhattan is larger than I would have ever guessed before I came out and started getting involved and on the apps\n\nOne of the happiest things for me I've seen was two guys casually holding hands in between the Engineering complex and Seaton Hall a few months ago. A grad student in my lab is also gay (came to the holiday party with his boyfriend) and at least one of my engineering students is also gay.\n\nThere are going to be ignorant people, but they're shut down fairly quickly, mostly by others in their peer groups. Realize that many rural kids without much exposure to differences come here. There were some [cowards who grafittied some anti-LGBT] (http://www.kwch.com/content/news/Slur-continues-diversity-related-vandalism-at-Kansas-State-450278103.html) stuff a while back, but the campus is definitely becoming more [LGBTQ friendly] (https://www.campuspride.org/campus-prides-2017-best-of-the-best-top-25-lgbtq-friendly-colleges-universities/), if not alreay there.",

Some of the religious groups get on my nerves from time to time, but that's just because they'll try and recruit you, and that happens on every campus. \n\nThe culture here has a very relaxed, live-and-let-live vibe. Honestly, its a breath of fresh air. I feel very comfortable here. \n\nI wouldn't let politics be a major concern. I'd be more worried about K-State's recent budget problems or just Manhattan in general. If you're not into partying, it can be pretty boring. ",

I have friends in my dorm who took English 100 and they said the only way to get an A is to write as liberally as possible... so it kinda just depends. A lot of the students here are either from big towns in Kansas like KC or Wichita, or from really small farm towns in the middle of nowhere, so the student population is pretty diverse in their beliefs.

My favorite HS teacher was a kstate alumnus mega liberal bernie supporter.  If i had to put a number on it, Kstate is 45% liberal leaning, 30% conservative, and 25% moderate/undecided.",

I'm an engineering student, so we mainly keep to ourselves, as engineers do, so I don't run into anybodies views either way. English classes, and some economic classes, will go more into politics and personal opinions but even then most people here at KState are respecting of everyone's views that I've seen. I would say out of the vocal groups on all sides of any political affiliations, it's about 50/50, you'll hear just much from a conservative view point as you will a liberal view point walking through the union or down the street.\n\nFunny story, a couple semesters ago, just after Sanders dropped out of the democratic race, my econ professor put up a poll with who the class would vote for if the election  was that day, there was Trump and Hillary and then 2 or 3 third party candidates. A surprising amount of people, to me, voted for Trump, but that was also when conservatives and liberals alike thought he had no fighting chance of winning, so I wonder how many of those votes were joke votes?",

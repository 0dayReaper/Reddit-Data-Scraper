Passionate about making a difference?***\n\nSchool for a Village (S4V) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization working to bridge the gap in STEM education for underserved secondary schools around the world through need-specific, targeted support.\n\n**Projects:** We built 3 science labs in Bahjoi, India, enabling &gt;1,000 students to complete the state-mandated curriculum for the first time. We have partnered with Choosito!, an NSF-funded digital library, to bring needed resources to students in Nanyuki, Kenya. Visit [school4village.org/projects/](http://school4village.org/projects/) to learn more!\n\nNone of this would be possible without our chapters and student ambassadors that work to promote advocacy and awareness for S4V. Learn more about these roles here: [school4village.org/join-us/](http://school4village.org/join-us/).\n\n***LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES:***\n\n* **S4V chapter leaders** initiate a *local chapter organization* at their universities/high schools. *Apply here!* [https://forms.gle/2B1jPpRukVSWW7i88](https://forms.gle/2B1jPpRukVSWW7i88)\n* **S4V student ambassadors** work *individually* to promote awareness for S4V. *Apply here!* [https://forms.gle/qs4FfrhU7A7YuxPv8](https://forms.gle/qs4FfrhU7A7YuxPv8)\n\nApplications will be accepted on a rolling basis.

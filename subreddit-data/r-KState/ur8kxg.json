And we is going to start at K-State in the fall to study landscape architecture. \n\nWhat are some cool spots for gift cards?\n\nShe likes music and vinyl. She loves art and loves to paint. She\u2019s into photography. She\u2019s vegetarian. \n\nThere\u2019s always the student union. But what else is there?",

            "comment": "[Sisters of Sound](https://www.sistersofsoundrecords.com/) is the record store, but I don't know that they do gift cards. The Union is probably the best place for art supplies.\n\nThere's unfortunately no dedicated camera/photography store in town.\n\nThere's always food or coffee. Varsity Donuts, Arrow Coffee, Bluestem are probably the best local options in those departments. Radinas is the on-campus coffee shop in the Union and a few other spots on campus (Lead Studies, the Engg building).",

She\u2019ll need a *huge* amount of supplies for her first year, so a gift card to Hobby Lobby and/or the campus store would be very useful. I bet I spent $500 on materials for my environmental design classes alone.\n\nAlso, a Radina\u2019s gift card is a good idea. She\u2019s going to have late nights in Seaton and Radina\u2019s is right across the plaza in the union.",

It\u2019s nice being able to run across the plaza to grab supplies last-minute without having to walk to the car, then drive to Hobby Lobby. \n\nOn the flip side, Hobby Lobby is *way* cheaper. I\u2019ve started to buy their store brand materials (and they go on sale all the time) instead of the name brand supplies the program suggests. I\u2019d say a Hobby Lobby gift card probably makes more sense so she could stock up before class.",

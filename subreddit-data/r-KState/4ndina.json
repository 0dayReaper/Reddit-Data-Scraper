            "comment": "Wow. This is too bad- the place really is an institution. They've been in business longer than any K-Stater has can remember (literally).\n\nI had tons of family work there. Father, uncles, aunts, cousins. (I myself just spent money on architecture supplies and books.) My father roomed with the family that owned it. I only talked with the guy and some of his family a few times but they were always really nice to me and would take time out of their day to have a good conversation.\n\nIt's too bad they lost that Union contract. I always hated spending a ton of money but at least it went to a local place. The quality now is terrible across the board, from merchandise to architecture supplies. And for me at least the prices never went down.\n\nVarneys really was a huge part of the Manhattan community and K-State. Our family has had three generations buying books, working, and socializing in the Ville under its friendly marquee. It's sad to think if I have a kid that goes to K-State Varneys won't be a part of that experience.\n\n126 years is a good run though. \n\nVarneys, I won't miss giving you my money, but things won't be the same without you.\n\n",

They profit don't get me wrong but the publishers and universities are who really make off with the money and set the new editions and make it difficult to sell back/ buy used.\n\nThe arch supplies weren't cheap (honestly not badly priced and they would online match) but they were around long enough that they knew what we needed for the most part.\n\nThe new place never in the union never stocked anything supply wise and it was all low quality. I tried going there for convenience a few times but you honestly just couldn't.\n\nThey were are also involved in the community. Sponsoring stuff, running stuff out of the store, etc. I haven't seen any of the new national business do that stuff, or at least not in a way that felt more like lip service.\n\nObviously it's a company at the end of the day. But to me at least it sometimes felt like a bit more than that.\n\nI always looked forward to see what the marquee would say when I walked by. I hope that doesn't go away.",

Losing those two contracts completely tanked their book sales, and once textbook sales went down like that it would have been difficult to bring them back up unless they were making enough money somewhere else to make up for huge losses upfront. Even then, in-store textbook sales are currently shifting significantly towards book rentals and used books (in large part due to online competition), which are really difficult for independently owned stores to fully stock and accommodate (as opposed to the current bookstore, which can source used books, etc. from hundreds of other campus bookstores owned by Follett).\n\n&gt; There really isn't a \"pivot\" for them to do if they were going to remain a book/ school supply store. It's not Varneys \"making a choice\" to go out of business.\n\nIt's not a choice for them at this point, but I feel like they drastically mispredicted their financial situation and outlook over the past few years, and could have made choices that would have prevented this. For instance, they could have closed their other locations and focused solely on their iconic Aggieville location. While their community engagement definitely helped maintain community good-will, that doesn't make up for declining customer service, (at least a lot of rumors about) mismanagement, and not finding ways to attract new student customers. It still wouldn't have been easy for them, but it likely wouldn't have been this catastrophic.\n\n&gt; Varneys also has been selling apparel for a long time but they were getting the squeeze on that too- K-State has been stepping up their own selling through the K-State Superstore and especially online.\n\nAt least in terms of local businesses, K-State Superstore is run by GTM. Granted, GTM's also apparently not doing the best financially and they don't exactly have the best reputation as a company.",

Not sure if that was part of a strategy to focus more in Manhattan but they have closed stores.\n\nI never had a problem with their customer service they always had been (especially when I'm the union) the best place in town to buy stuff for my major. That's anecdotal and maybe other people had other experiences.\n\nI still don't see how they could remain Varneys in the classic sense of the store without a pivot that nearly completely changes what they do. Maybe there's a way to make that change or still make it as a bookseller but perhaps that's just not a route the wanted to go.\n\nThis kind of stuff happens in most towns as they expand though, it's not too surprising in the end.",

It's truly a sad thing to see this business that has been around for a long time falter because of poor decision making, among other things.",

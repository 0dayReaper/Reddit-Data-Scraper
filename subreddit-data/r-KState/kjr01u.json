I\u2019m originally from north jersey right outside of New York City. can anyone from the northeast and/or bigger cities give me a sense of the transition? I love how the program looks on paper, but I\u2019m a bit worried I won\u2019t be able to handle the culture shock (if that makes any sense?). any insight would greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "The fact that you'll be at K-State will be a huge plus for you. Manhattan as a town has its limitations but it is a college town which helps immensely. I would lean on your classmates to at least get you settled and started. Try some networking through them first. Then branch out to some of your interests in the community.\n\nI'd agree with others that there is a scene for anyone here. You definitely get the sense that there are some rich kids from the big city (Kansas City) and some good ol' boys from the small towns out west. Plus, if you need that city fix you just have to drive two hours east to Kansas City. K-State also has a large international student population (at least in a normal year) which also adds some diversity.\n\nAnd this is the Midwest so expect everyone to be exceedingly friendly. \ud83d\ude03",

People will smile and nod and say hi to strangers.  It's nice.\n\nWe don't have passenger trains around here.  Someone else mentioned Kansas City and they are right; there's quite a bit there.  You have to drive in a car though.  Or make friends with someone who has a car and will go.  :)\n\nI like it here.  I've known folks from New York who liked it here well enough (military who got assigned to the nearby fort).  They said it was extremely quiet compared to what they were used to (figuratively and literally), but they found that appealing.\n\nIf there is a way to visit here for a few days and get a taste of what it's like, I would recommend that.  I know COVID has made traveling pretty tough.",

The are around campus is very geared towards the University and college students. Everything is very accessible by a short walk or bike ride and there is some bus service to hubs. During the school day you will see hundreds or thousands of students walking to class, getting a bite to eat, or heading off to wherever they are going. \n\nYou will probably have a shock when you first get to Manhattan but i bet if you spent a few months at K-State you\u2019d find yourself missing things from MHK. It\u2019s easy to find stuff to do and people are friendly but nobody is going to force you to go out and have fun either. It will be, like most places, what you make of it.

There's people from all over the world here and there's a place for everyone, but it still gets quiet after the bars close. It's a happy medium and you might just find you really enjoy it. As a lifelong townie, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else, but I'm biased. Your mileage may vary, of course, but there are MUCH smaller towns with colleges that I feel pretty safe saying someone like yourself wouldn't fit in in. Manhattan's not that.",

Beer can be bought in grocery stores and gas stations until midnight. It's only been within the past two years that grocery stores and gas stations have been able to sell beer with an a.b.w over 3.2%.

Chakrabarti, Law, and Berg at various points in my time there.\n\nA few things about Manhattan:\n\n* [Aggieville](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aggieville/@39.1856216,-96.5766105,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87bdd27847d8ad39:0xafd51091ba72cc60!8m2!3d39.1856175!4d-96.5744218) is the main eating/drinking area in Manhattan and is located a block to the southeast of campus. [Downtown](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Downtown/@39.1794011,-96.5634811,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87bdd2622793f9b9:0xdda4b5d99df0913d!8m2!3d39.179399!4d-96.5623868) is coming into its own, though. There's a lot of really good places around town, but they're mostly concentrated in these areas. \n\n* [Auntie Mae's](https://www.auntiemaes.com/) in Aggieville is the best bar in Manhattan, in my opinion. During non-pandemic times, they'll have trivia, open mic, music, horrible movie nights, drag shows, bingo, etc., as well as the best bar staff. If you want to go to a good townie bar (townie described elsewhere here), try Finn's. Good drinks, (almost entirely) friendly people, and multiple pool tables and darts machines. \n\n* If you want Brooklyn-ish style pizza, go to Hi-Lo in Aggieville or A.J.'s in downtown (same owner, but Hi-Lo serves fantastic drinks and is much better for socializing. You will have to buy [Pizza Shuttle](http://www.pizzashuttle.org/) at some point, though. Sorry, it's a rule. I'd suggest the Santa Fe with jalapenos.\n\n* There is some [public transportation](https://www.rileycountyks.gov/1664/Routes-Services#:~:text=The%20aTa%20Bus%20serves%20all,the%20Green%20Valley%20and%20St.). It's not too bad to get around town on public transportation, but you have to plan ahead. You can also bike but there's several hills, mostly on campus and the west and north sides of town, that can make that difficult. I'd suggest you have a car.\n\n* For late nights, [Safe Ride](https://www.k-state.edu/student-involvement/saferide/) exists with free or discounted rides for students via Lyft from 11 pm to 3 am.\n\n* Grocery stores are either all the way to the east near Fort Riley Blvd (Hy-Vee, Walmart, Dillons) or west off of Sethchild (Dillons and Target). Depending on where you find a place to stay, you'll do most of your shopping either on the west or east side of town. Fast food is similarly split up, though there's a few places (Burger King, Popeye's, Starbucks) in Aggieville.\n\n* Weather: It's Kansas. We get the best and worst of it all. Expect snow and ice storms in the winter and hot, extremely humid days in the summer. And hail, high winds, tornadoes, etc. Depending on the age of your vehicle, I might suggest comprehensive insurance.",

    "postText": "I am an incoming freshman and I was wondering how the housing selection process works. The contract is available starting on November 1st, but what happens after I submit it? Do I get to pick my room right away? Do I have to wait a few months? Do I have to put in my first pick dorm choice? Also, how does locking in your roommate work? I have a roommate,  but how do I request her/ put her on the housing contract? If any of you have insight into this process then that would be awesome. ",

Like you, I submitted mine as soon as I could on November 1st, so we got one of the first slots to pick a room and my roommate and I got the one we wanted in Wefald, but we didn\u2019t actually select that until maybe April.",

You'll see option for what building/dorm you want to choose. Contrary to how the process has worked in the past, you get to pick the exact room you live in even as a freshman. So when doing your contract pick a room that you roommate and you both like that has two openings and try and take those spots before anyone else can at the same time. If you have any other questions I can answer them for you!",

I think you have 24 hours to sign the contract after picking what you want so you can back out at a certain point and pick another room BUT make sure you don't confirm or else you're locked in.",

For some reason though, there seems to be a very real movement on this campus that is intentionally attempting to divide people for whatever reason. \n\nAll of these events are abusing people's natural good intentions of wanting the best for their fellow man, leading to knee-jerk reactions before anything more than one side of the story is out.

Even if it wasn't the storm that uprooted it, how would an individual (or several) be able to maintain control of a tent that size during a storm? Also- there are multiple cameras watching that area on/ inside of the dorms/ dining area. You can go see them for yourself if you don't believe me. Look- there are for a fact, racist incidents happening across the country, in Kansas, and on our campus. But the body of evidence overwhelming points to that tent being blown away by the wind. The soil was already damp from several days of rain before the storm, which would have made it easier to have been blown by the wind. So yes- there absolutely is doubt that it was a malicious act. There's so many horrible things happening in the world, we don't need to be making them up.",

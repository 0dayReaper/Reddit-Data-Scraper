I don't know where you're from, but I came from the KC area, and Salina is a fairly small town. It's big for the area, so it has quite a bit for the size of the town. It's weird. ",

Don't get me wrong, Manhattan is an amazing town. The Manhattan campus is gorgeous and over all the best but the polytechnic campus is good for those who like smaller classes. ",

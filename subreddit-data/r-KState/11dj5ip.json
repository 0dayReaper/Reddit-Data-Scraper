Earhart Hall, on the other hand, has communal bathrooms on each floor with separated shower and toilet rooms with communal sinks. While the communal bathrooms are a disadvantage, the Earhart Hall rooms each have a walk-in closet which helps significantly with storage space. \n\nWith regard to deciding which one is best for you, both have their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nHope this helps!",

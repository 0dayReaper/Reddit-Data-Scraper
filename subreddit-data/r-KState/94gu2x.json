Are there any must-have items that most people forget? Are there any move-in tips out there that will make moving in easier? Or maybe sharing what time is the best time to move in? \n\nI will be moving in on the 18th, as my parents will be helping me and they have to work during the week.\nI\u2019m living in goodnow and I\u2019m on the ground floor, so I won\u2019t have to worry about the elevators!

            "comment": "&gt; tips for move-in day and packing for college\n\nBe careful of bringing more of your things than you actually need. Remember you have to share a very small room with another person and all the things they bring as well. When it comes to large or shared items (such as a mini-fridge, microwave, furniture, or a rug), contact your roommate in advance to make sure you don't double up on anything. Also, keep in mind that exposed heating elements are not allowed, so no toasters, griddles, or certain kinds of space heaters.\n\n&gt;Are there any must-have items that most people forget?\n\nI don't know if these are commonly forgotten, but you should remember to bring a desk lamp, a laundry bag/basket, and a can of air freshener. I would also highly recommend a decently sized fan to help circulate the air when you have your windows or door open, or to keep yourself cool if you and your roommate can't agree on a thermostat setting (that was the one point of contention with my freshman year roommate).\n\nUnless you know you'll be visiting home before cold weather starts to roll in, bring a coat or at least a light jacket.\n\n&gt;what time is the best time to move in?\n\nAs early as possible. It will be a bit chaotic but once you're settled you can help other students move in which is quite possibly the best way to start making friends and making good impressions.\n\nGood luck!",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I am taking the not so common approach of going back to school and getting a completely different degree that what I got the first time around. This being said. I will be a freshman in the Industrial Design course this fall, and will be 23 in September. I would rather not live in the dorms, and have been looking at the apartments around town.\n\nThus far I have heard good things about The Links and the Wildcat Inn, and have considered The Pointe on College Ave as well. I have mainly been looking at 2 bed/2 bath options, but don't have any leads on roommates. \n\nAny recommendations on either places to live, or decent ways to find a roommate while being new to campus are appreciated. Thanks!",

There are also tons of options on Craigslist or if you\u2019re in the area just driving around and finding \u201cfor rent\u201d signs. Some places don\u2019t advertise besides yard signs. The smaller landlords here are generally cheaper but you don\u2019t get the same amenities that you would at the links or a bigger complex. There are some buildings that will pair you with a roommate if that\u2019s the road you want to go down. And last there\u2019s always jardine which is the Kansas state apartments that will pair you with 3 other Kansas state students but if you do that you\u2019ll probably be the oldest. Good luck",

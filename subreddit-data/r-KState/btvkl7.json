One separate building was removed and the full site integrated into one building. \n\nThe building is so different it no longer felt like the same space, as in they lost the history of the original space. \n\nAlso I think there was a major fire at Hale library and the library has been closed for a year or two. \n\nI visited in January for the first time since 2010.",

Right now they're thinking part of the first floor can be open for fall semester but I believe the anticipated total completion is late 2020/early 2021. There are areas where the plaster is still wet so work isn't even scheduled for those spots yet.",

    "postText": "Hey there! I\u2019m a junior in Highschool (in state) and I\u2019m applying for K-State soon. I\u2019m not planning on taking four years of science in high school and was wondering if I need to get a certain score on the science section of the ACT to get into K-State (due to only having three years of sci). I\u2019ve looked on the admissions website and can\u2019t find anything, but a friend warned me about it. I\u2019m not applying to any program that requires anything extra.",

Pretty general degree that isn't that great for job prospects, maybe if you market well and also do a great internship. It's a pretty general degree a lot of people obtain, so hard to stand out",

I ended up ditching HR altogether for consulting. In general,  there are tons of business students so it\u2019s very competitive to get the big 4/Fortune 500 jobs.",

I can\u2019t speak to the HR placements from business (I was a K-State psych grad focused on I/O psych), but depending upon what you want to do with your career, you might consider grad school\n\nThere weren\u2019t a lot of opportunities For HR for psych grads when I graduated many, many moons ago, and going to get my Masters in HR &amp; Industrial Relations at Minnesota was the smartest move my clueless young self ever made. \n\nEspecially if you will be mobile for a while in your career and want to target Fortune 500 companies. With two years of additional schooling, I more than doubled what my starting salary would have been, and opened up my career opportunities massively. Those opportunities are still paying off today as far as my marketability. Not necessarily the degree any more\u2026after 3-5 years working, your work experience will be more important than your schooling\u2026but the Masters gave me a big jumpstart \n\nThat being said, grad school tuition was waaaay cheaper a couple decades ago, so YMMV on whether it\u2019s financially worth it these days \n\nOh, and get any internships you can in HR if you can swing it. Even if the pay is horrible, it helps to differentiate you from all the other grads and will be worth it in the long run",

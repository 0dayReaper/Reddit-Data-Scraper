It's a quiet town with not all that much going on, and I say that in the best possible way.  I loved summers when the students were gone and you could go anywhere at any time without worrying about waiting.  I loved football season when the town was 20k bigger on Saturdays and you couldn't go anywhere without it being mobbed by fans in purple (and occasional other colors).  I am biased in that I am a very much a homebody but I really loved living in Manhattan.  If I'd gotten a job offer to stay out there, I would have.",

The similarities are: undergrads getting very excited about football season, and they're both reasonably cultured and diverse compared to most of the state.\n\nManhattan is much less diverse (so, less exciting restaurants and things to do, in general...and it's further away from a major city that will have exciting concerts, etc), BUT I will say the people and staff are lovely and nice. I think if you are interested in the research and the professors, then you will have a good time. If you need more diversity than A2, then it's not a great fit.\n",

It's definitely a town on it's way up. The new national bio ag defence facility is supposed to double the size of the town by 2025 (from 20,000 townies to 40,000). So that should be interesting. The school population is another 20,000 people give or take so the town is literally half empty in the summer. It gets pretty hectic around game days and local holidays but otherwise it's a pretty quiet town. People are generally really nice. I've never felt unsafe. \n\nNegatives would be that compared to other similar sized towns in Kansas the rent is high. But still well below the national average. Not a whole lot of variety in things to do. You can go to aggieville, downtown, Pillsbury, Tuttle, and not much else. ",

Limited things to do, and one of my big cons here is ease of travel. Manhattan airport is very small (5-6 flights a day) and only flies to Dallas or Chicago and tickets are often a lot more expensive. While Kansas City airport has more options: it's still small for an international airport, it's a two hour drive away, and frankly it's a dump. \n\nManhattan is quiet and safe, and cost of living is low. With a half decent funding offer you shouldn't have much trouble making ends meet here. But that comes with there not being a ton of things to do. I will say for the size of the town there's a decent variety of locally owned restaurants. \n\nIn my opinion it's a pretty campus too, though venturing onto main campus has always been a rarity for me.",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm an undergrad (senior) in KSU's chemistry program. I'm not going to post much about the town's atmosphere in general because I'm from a rural area and so Manhattan is (by my standards) a large urban center.\n\nK-State's Chemistry Department is not only quite small for a school of its size but, sadly, very poorly funded and at times lacks the state-of-the-art instruments that, say, Nebraska-Lincoln or KU have (the worst offender for that was the NMR facilities but thankfully they're installing a new machine this coming week). The actual quality of facilities you'd be working in varies quite a bit though, depending on how much grant money your research group has (or has had in the recent past); because of this it might be helpful to know if you know who's group you'd be joining. \n\nThat being said, the relatively small size of the Chem department has (from my perspective) allowed a fairly strong community to grow. As an undergrad, both the graduate students and the faculty are very friendly and approachable (which was not the case when I was a summer visiting scholar at another large Midwestern public university that shall remain nameless). In addition, from my understanding, the department is able to produce and publish more impactful research than most of the other Big XII universities in spite of its limitations.\n\nFor what its worth, I am not planning to attending grad school immediately after getting my bachelor's and would rather wait a few years. However, from having looked a bit at graduate programs K-State is not my first choice, but it wouldn't be my last choice either.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you have any questions.",

            "comment": "I went to KSU for grad school after completing my undergrad at GVSU. I enjoyed my time in Manhattan but there were a lot of things that I really missed about living in a metro area. The campus was conservative compared to GVSU so it's going to feel hyper conservative compared to Michigan. \n\n\nIf you're expecting Manhattan to be anything like Ann Arbor you'll be disappointed. Manhattan is really a island in the middle of a state that is sparsely populated outside of the Kansas City Metro area. When I was a student about ten years ago there wasn't a wide selection of food outside of things like the olive garden, kfc, and other middle of the road restaurants. \n\nAggieville is a cool area but it's almost always overrun with undergrads. If you end up teaching as I did, it's hard to find bar where you won't run into students. Mae's was about the only place that I could have a beer in peace. \n\nNow there are some cool things about KSU too. Even though it's a large school, it still feels pretty small. I got to know a lot of people outside my grad program which was cool. I would, however, strongly urge you to make the best decision based on your program. Have you been offered funding? If so was the funding package competitive? What swayed me into attending KSU is that they waived my tuition, offered me a GTA position, and awarded me a sizable scholarship. It was really hard for me to say no to their package compared to other schools. In all, I'm super happy that I attended there. \n",

To be frank there was one poor Thai restaurant, one place to get sushi, one okay Mexican restaurant, and a whole bunch of middle of the road American-fare places. Where OP is from there is a ton more variety and a lot higher quality restaurants than you\u2019ll find in Manhattan in the same way that Kansas City has far more to offer than Manhattan. \n\nedit: I don't typically comment if one of my comments is downvoted because it's not really a productive thing to do but, I'm going to break that trend here. For a lot of kids at KSU, Manhattan IS a large metro area given they've come from small town Kansas. Unless you're from one of the seven cities that are larger than Manhattan, Manhattan will feel large and diverse to you. The area that OP currently lives in is much, much, much larger than Manhattan and has a lot more to food, entertainment, and diversity options to offer. This isn't necessarily a knock on Manhattan, but it is true nonetheless. This is information that I wish that I had prior to attending school there. \n\nTo be fair form searching Yelp it looks like there are currently 3 Thai, 2 Sushi, and 7 Mexican restaurants in the area now so there are more offerings than bar food and middle of the road american fare. Harry's is still there which is nice, but there hasn't been a lot of fine dining development. \n\nLike I said in another comment, I enjoyed my time in Manhattan and would be happy to raise my family there. With that said, you have to understand that people from large cities are not going to find Manhattan to be a super diverse place with a lot to offer. ",

                            "comment": "I was only there for two years as I did a Masters degree. Campus life as a grad student is totally different than campus life as an undergrad so it's hard to compare the two. When I was a grad student I spent a lot of my time at departmental events with other grad students. I imagine you'd end up doing the same. As other's have mentioned, don't expect to have the same social life that you had as an undergrad while you're a grad student. If you're doing grad school right, you're going to be far more busy than you've ever been in the past. \n\nSports are totally different because KSU is a Big 12 school and not a D2 GLIAC school. I was only able to make it to a couple of football games but they were a ton of fun. The basketball games were a lot more fun because they're shorter and they don't take up your entire day. The octagon of doom is an awesome venue. When I was there the football and basketball teams were both really good so going to the games meant likely seeing a K-State win. The football team is not likely to be good next year while the basketball team will be in a bit of a reloading year. \n \nManhattan is to Kansas City as Allendale is to Grand Rapids so keep that in mind. I forgot to mention that Omaha isn't too far away either. My wife and I would take weekend trips to Omaha and Kansas City when we wanted to get out of town for a while. \n\nOne thing that no one prepared me for was the heat and humidity. Kansas is HOT and Humid in the summer. Like really, really, really hot and humid. I know that people from Michigan think that it's hot and humid there, but Michigan has nothing on Kansas. Another thing that I found surprising was how weird it felt to live in a land-locked state. I grew up near the lake so it felt odd to me to not be able to drive to the lake. \n\nI was offered a full-time job in my field at KSU after I graduated but I turned it down because I wanted to live in a far more metro area. I live in Southern CA now. Now that I'm older and have kids, I'd love to raise my family there. I won't ever be able to move back because KSU won't be able match my current salary adjusting for cost of living, but we visit every few years to catch a football game and to see friends who still live in the area and work at the university. \n\nIt's not a bad place to live/go to school, but you really have to know what you're getting into before you go. \n",

            "comment": "Current KSU grad student here (in Comm Studies)- to echo what has been said, Manhattan is what Kansas considers a \u201ccity\u201d but is not necessarily a large metropolitan place. If you like the outdoors, then you can find plenty to do in the surrounding Flint Hills. I actually commute from a smaller town because my partner and I have a house and he works for a different university full time, whereas I am just a student and GRA and only go to campus a couple days a week. We do a lot of a outdoor hiking/biking and enjoy traveling to the weird towns and places Kansas has to offer. Seriously- check out Weird Kansas and The Kansas Guide for Explorers pt. 2. \n\nKSU tries to offer a lot of things for students of all ages and that\u2019s kinda fun. For example, Tuesday there was a free talk by Pete Souza (White House photographer for Reagan/Obama) and it was awesome. The campus does feel a lot more conservative than the private school I went to for undergrad (in another part of KS), which is weird, but you\u2019ll find plenty of non-conservatives here. \n\nUltimately, as a grad student, you\u2019re not going to have the same schedule with the same freedoms as an undergrad because workload/lab (I\u2019m assuming since you\u2019re in Chem)/ and teaching if you\u2019re offered a GTA position. Pick the program that works for you, your financials, and will make you happy - you\u2019ll find your place in the town/city/campus no matter where it\u2019s at. Also, grad school is a finite amount of time compared to the rest of your life; it\u2019s good to remember that you don\u2019t HAVE to live forever in the place your school is in.",

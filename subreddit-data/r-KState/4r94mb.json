I was wondering if any of you Wildcats would be interested in forming a team to compete.\n\nIf you are interested in forming a team leave a comment below with your Battle.net ID, or add my Battle.net ID: TheRrrr42#1417\n\nEven if we don't form a team or do well I think it would be good fun to have some fellow Wildcats to play Overwatch with.\n",

    "postText": "I rent a room inside of a house located at 1870 Platt Street. It's directly next door from the Goodnow dorm Parking Lot and across the street from Lafene Health Center. I signed the lease, because it was so close to campus, but now that I've graduated, I've got no reason to stay here. Along with the room, you have access to two bathrooms, a kitchen and a garage. All utilities are covered except for internet.\n\n[Google Maps Image](https://i.imgur.com/PLku8Mb.png)\n\n[Pics of shared living room, kitchen, and garage](https://www.imgur.com/a/PX7pX6w)\n\n[Pic of unfurnished room](https://www.imgur.com/a/luf0DRF)\n\nThe rent is $390 per month, and it lasts until July 24th. If you're interested, please email me at emchege@ksu.edu and I can get you in contact with the landlord. If you'd like to, I can also schedule a tour of the house itself",

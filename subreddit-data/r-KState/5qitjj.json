    "postText": "I was awarded a private scholarship to help pay for childcare expenses. I have received all my other aid except the private scholarship. On KSIS under my Spring 2017 award summary, it shows my scholarship as received. On account activity, it is not there, but all my other aid is. I was wondering if anyone else had experience with this, I hate bothering the financial aid office if I don't have to as I know they are the busiest office on campus",

Sometimes I don't get it until two or three months in. But that doesn't involve k state, yeah to the people who sponsored it. ",

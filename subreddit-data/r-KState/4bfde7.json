After years of having absolutely terrible coaches and zero support from students and fans Bob Huggins and Frank Martin brought our basketball program into the spotlight again, lots of NCAA appearances one of which was very successful. Revived the energy of the crowd and made us known for at least a year or two as one of the toughest places to play. \n\nFlashforward to this year: 16-17 record, no post-season, and suppressing school spirit among other things. To top it off we could have hired a former K-State grad, Brad Underwood, who has had incredible success in his first couple years of being head coach, also used to be the associate head coach under Frank Martin, but he was snatched up by OSU instead. He is considered to be a grand slam hire, and to add more to the pile he wanted to coach here but our AD was more worried about padding his resume with safe hires instead of smart ones. ",

    "postText": "I'm a K-State student living in Manhattan this summer and I'm looking for good places to go bass fishing. I've been to the tubes at Tuttle and I've been to Rocky Ford but neither of which were good for bass and were also heavily pressured. I love fishing any kind of water whether it be a creek, river, pond or lake. I only practice catch and release and am simply looking to enjoy nature. So, what spots should I look into? ",

Travel up the creek a good ways, you want to get as far away from the crossing where all the people are. This is my favorite spot for bass, you find the right hole, you'll get bites as soon as you toss your bait in. I've had luck with all sorts of bait, they seem to bite whatever. \n\nMost important thing is to get far away from the crossing area. Horrible luck for fishing there.",

The coves and the creeks that feed them are decent for crappie, catfish, some bass.\n\nThe better bass fishing is probably on Lake Milford, though. It's a longer drive (45 min?) but may have better results.",

            "comment": "In response to the other comment, the grass lots on the east side of the stadium are probably the closest option. \nAlso, there is parking available at IGP (International Grains Program) complex, right northeast of the stadium. It\u2019s maybe a 5 minute walk from the stadium, and still has a lot of tailgaters. Both have a fairly large amount of parking spots and I believe cost $20-$25, but be sure to get there early. ",

The grass lot on the far east may be full by 3 hours.\n\nIf you are finding a ticket for sale online it will either be for the East lot or the West lot. These are stadium owned lots that have numbered stalls. The earlier you get there, the easier it is to get into your spot, but your spot will be there no matter what time you get in.\n\nThere are also some public streets you can park on and walk to the stadium on the South-West side, but it's a bit of a walk.",

            "comment": "The blacktop parking lots east and west are all ahead of time things I believe. Just east of the east lot is where mostly students park. It is $20 open until filled. If you are a student/young and plan on partying, this is absolutely the place to be. Further east you can also park in the Rec's north lot for $20 (entering from Denison). The field north of the stadium across Kimball is also $20. I'd recommend those if you are not a student or don't want to be by hammered idiots. Be there early to be safe and guarentee a spot, especially if you plan on parking in the student area. There are surely other spots as well, but those are the areas I have been in.\n\nHard to be more specific other than saying \"early.\" A good chunk of people will be getting there right when gates open five hours prior to kickoff. Depending on weather, how good we are, opponent, and kickoff time a lot can change from how fast they fill up. Too hard to say for certain how early is or isn't safe.",

You will see the first couple houses on that street asking for $20 to park on the yard.\n\nGo a little further...and park on the street. Less than 1/4th of a mile to the stadium...and completely free.",

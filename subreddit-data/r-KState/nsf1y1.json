I\u2019ll be in the Mass Com/Journalism school, I\u2019m on the rodeo team, &amp; I\u2019m living in a traditional in West Hall. \nI\u2019d love to hear whatever you guys have to share about your experiences, the good, bad and the ugly, any tips or advice, etc! Also curious on what The Aggieville scene and party scene is like. TIA!",

I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy the rodeo team, there\u2019s a lot of rural/ag people at KSU. The other commenter\u2019s experience was like 40 years ago, don\u2019t be worried, K-State\u2019s a friendly place. Unfortunately, can\u2019t help you with the party scene.",

            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m a December 2019 grad. I lived in Moore, which is in the Derby complex for my freshman year. The Derb is the best! West was under construction when I was on-campus, so I think it looks quite a bit different now and The Derb also is newly renovated! You\u2019ll want to get involved in your dorm and community; I met so many good friends in the dorms. \u201cFloor dinners\u201d were of the best times. I really recommend doing the cheesy back to school activities and taking advantage of free Call Hall at any events and booths. I also can\u2019t recommend enough - if you\u2019re wanting to work part time to find an on-campus job. They can be a great ways to get involved, meet people, and work with your schedule while also making a bit of money! \n\nWhile you\u2019re under 21, the true party scene will likely be house parties. Dirty Dawgs, Kaws House Party, and Tubby\u2019s were some of the 18+ bars while I was there and it can be a lot of fun just to go out with friends and dance. I\u2019ll be vague - be safe and smart, the bouncers are pretty good at doing their jobs in MHK. The Ville is a ton of fun to bar hop when you do turn 21, but I recommend pregaming to save money. \n\nYou HAVE to go the Varsity Truck after a night out. My other favorite spots are Top of the World, Manhattan hill, KS hill, So Long Saloon, The Chef, cookie bakes @ Mr. Ks, Arrow Coffee, Bluestem Bistro, and Public Hall. \n\nManhattan is a special place. I wish I could be in your shoes again! Go \u2018Cats.",

I was also really involved in the Collegian, so pick your student media of choice and hop in, because it\u2019s a great way to get valuable experience, clips, and meet people!\n\nParty scene involves a lot of house parties. I\u2019ve lived in a lot of college towns and Aggieville is the only place to do a proper pub crawl, imo.",

I know, no one has mentioned this but its important.\n\n2 - Sit in the front, toward the middle. It makes you have eye contact with the professor which in turn keeps your mind engaged and helps keep you awake.\n\n3 - Talk to your professors BEFORE there is a problem. If you feel like you dont understand something, let the prof know right away. Keep doing this until you understand. If you wait until you fail a test to go to the prof, its too late. If you go early, there is a VERY good chance you can retake a test because you identified the issue and he/she was unable to overcome your not understanding. That makes it a teaching problem.\n\n4 - Go To Class. Seriously. You are PAYING to be there. Show the F up.\n\n5 - Sit in the front, toward the middle. The prof will recognize you as someone who shows up, is awake and is engaged. If you approach them about an issue learning, you dont want them to say \"which class are you in?\"\n\n6 - Talk to your professors. I had to miss a ton of class because of ROTC commitments. I let my professors know early and rescheduling stuff, getting different deadlines, etc was not a problem. My son is also in ROTC and because I beat this into him he did the same. Toward the end of last semester he was going to miss a quiz in a class he had an A in. The professor said \"You have an A. Im going to assume you will ace this quiz\" and gave him credit for taking the quiz.\n\n7 - Go to class, sit up front, talk to your professors.\n\n8 - TWO HOURS. Dedicate two hours a night to homework/study. Two honest hours. That means no phone, no TV, no reddit for two hours of solid study. Do this 5 nights a week - Sunday to Thursday. No Studying Friday night. Your brain needs a rest. Saturday is optional or additional study. You might need to study more some days/nights but never go less. ALWAYS do your two hours. ALWAYS.\n\n9 - Hear it, write it, use it in context. Hear what the professor says. Write down what you hear. Use that in context. Do this and you will LEARN. if you take notes in class, rewrite them after class and your retention will skyrocket. Use it in context and you will internalize.\n\n10 - Seriously, two hours. If you do that from the first day of the term to the end you will not have to cram at the end of the semester. Two good hours every day. Two good hours. Trust me. It works.\n\nAnd 11 - Go. To. Class.",

Manhattan was NOTHING like it is now: think ratty old buildings, nothing to do except go to bars or Tuttle Creek. I hated every second I was there, never went to bars because I didn't have a fake ID.  I was in a sorority for 2 years and made some pretty good friends. The most fun I had was going to KU to visit my best friend from high school and my crush.\n\nI cannot go to Manhattan to this day without having PTSD from worrying about studying enough. I go to Oklahoma State University for continuing education meetings so I won't have to face Manhattan.\n\nMy recommendation to you since you are a journalism major and don't need super great grades is to find a way to balance school with a fun college experience.",

Manhattan was a small town filled with small people and a small worldview. That changed almost as I was driving away.\n\nFrom 94 to 2013 I was in MHK once for about 3 hours when I drove from Leavenworth to the Octagon for a basketball game.  \n\nIn 2013 I went back to watch the Cats play UMASS.  The West Stadium had just opened and my daughter was a UMASS student so it seems like destiny said to go.  I was honestly gobsmacked at how much Manhattan had changed.  It went from Applebees being fine dining to a foodie town with amazing options.  Dinner at Coco Bolos, breakfast at The Chef and doughnuts at Varsity.  The friendliness of campus had spread to the city and it was no longer a \"townies vs gownines\" atmosphere.   \n\nMy son just graduated in May and I was honestly sad to drive away.  You should go back.  Its really worth it.\n\nEdit - just checked my Marriott records.  Since 2013 I have spent 68 days in MHK.",

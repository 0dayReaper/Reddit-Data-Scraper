    "postText": "Hello! I'll be beginning at K-State this fall and I know absolutely no one there. I will be staying in a traditional double in Moore Hall. If you are also looking for a roommate, please message me!\n\nI'll be majoring in physics. My first semester will consist of Physics I, Physics today, calculus, and Chem I. I absolutely love all things science, but I find basically all subjects interesting. Despite my unavoidable nerdiness, I am very social. I enjoy going out with friends and late nights. Above all, I'd like my roommate to be social, engaging, and respectful.",

They try and expel him, he wins a lawsuit (not only money but an established precedent for free speech in public universities). If they do nothing, they have no sports money and more people will see how pathetic these leftist are (crying over a decades-old joke). Even if he is attacked in any way he will be viewed as a martyr by many people. Only way this doesn\u2019t work out for him is if he backs down/apologizes, and it\u2019s pretty clear he has the balls not to do that.",

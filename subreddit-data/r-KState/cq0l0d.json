My current rent rate is\u00a0**(519.99plus $569.99for the second room)**\u00a0and my lease ends on\u00a0**(July 31, 2020).**\u00a0\u00a0You will be responsible for electricity and water (IF OVER THE $30.00 ALOTTED AMOUNT). The average for electricity is about\u00a0**($150)**\u00a0per month per room.\u00a0 The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable, and internet.\u00a0 Another great thing about reletting is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my re-let",

    "postText": "Hello everyone. I got a few questions that I hope  can be answered. I am interested in  attending\u200b the Polytechnic for the Computer Systems Technology program. I am wondering how good is the Computer Systems Technology program at the Polytechnic campus? Is it a worthwhile degree? How good were the professor who taught the classes. For those who have taken the course, how was  difficult was it to find a job after graduation? ",

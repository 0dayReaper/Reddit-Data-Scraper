    "postText": "This research study explores the concept of rape culture and how it is experienced in the daily lives of women. We are exploring the best way to measure this concept in quantitative form. Participation in our study is only open to females. Participation involves completing questionnaires related to mental and emotional stress and stressful events you may or may not have experienced, which takes about 15 minutes. We will give you a full description of the study if you contact us to consider participation. For participating in our study, you will receive $5 after your answers have been screened as valid.\n\nTo be eligible for participation, you must be 18 years old or older, female, and a currently registered undergraduate student in an American university. In addition, you must be able to operate a computer keyboard and read a computer screen.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about the project and participating, please go to our [survey page](https://umassboston.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_41wLR5wXJWeqmYR)\n\nThis study has been approved by the UMass Boston Institutional Review Board.\nThe Principal Investigator of this study is Madeline Brodt (madeline.brodt001@umb.edu)",

This way they can choose to participate if they feel that it is within their mental/emotional resources. Survey methods are imperfect but we feel this balance between validity and informed consent made sense for our study.",

Given that this is correlational cross sectional research rather than experimental/observational research, some research design theory has indicated that the priming effect is negligible. ",

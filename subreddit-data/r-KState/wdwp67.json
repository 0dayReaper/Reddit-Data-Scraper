I checked what books I need and all 5 of my classes say that they are Not Yet Determined. How close to the first day of class will books be determined? I feel like this isn\u2019t super helpful with class starting in \u22483 weeks",

I started this summer and bought a book for a class early on that I didn't end up using at all and had to buy again through one of the class programs (SAGE Vantage). \n\nThe advice I received from some professors and juniors/seniors was wait until the first day of class before buying anything. That's my plan for fall semester but also pay attention to your K-State email as some teachers send out info about a week before class. Obviously this can be a little stressful but these books are expensive and sometimes you won't need them.",

            "comment": "Don't buy the books, seriously. I know it sounds absurd, but you really will not need the course textbooks 95% of the classes. And it won't even be one of those \"nice to have in hand just in case\" situations.... you will get to the end of the semester, see a pile of completely unused brand-new editions sitting there, and feel like you wasted 500 bucks. And you can maybe sell them back to the bookstore for 10 or 15 bucks.\n\nFor the 5% of classes that actually use the textbook, don't stress about not knowing ahead of time which classes those are. The professors know that nobody buys the texts, they will make it clear in the first day if you are going to need it. You can get it off the internet at that point (get older editions, hardly anything changes in these books between editions).\n\nIf you absolutely get caught off guard and need a text right away (say, a week into classes), the bookstore is always there. Yeah, it's expensive, but use it as an emergency option. Using it once or twice over your college days is still a lot cheaper than buying every book ahead of time.\n\nYou will regret buying books ahead of time. Listen to everybody here, just don't do it. You will save hundreds of dollars your first semester alone, and after that you should be able to see for yourself how unnecessary they are.",

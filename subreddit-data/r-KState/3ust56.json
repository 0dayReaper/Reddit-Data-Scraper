    "postText": "Like the title says, Im looking for a subleaser come January 2016. Rent is $380+electric and internet, I usually end up paying about $450/month. The apartment is at Chase Manhattan, an easy mile walk from campus. There is one other guy on the lease (2 bedroom apt). He keeps mostly to himself, and has never missed a payment over the last 2 years we have lived together. If you have any questions, feel free to pm me",

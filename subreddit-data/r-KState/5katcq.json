    "postText": "Some friends and I were originally going to go to Kansas City for New Year's Eve but it's looking like it's going to be a bit too expensive to do that. Do you have to buy wristbands for New Years in aggieville? I found some for sale but it didn't seem like you had to buy them unless you wanted the random discounts. Also, what bars will probably be best? Is the event as a whole pretty cool? I'm also looking for bar recommendations for my friend's 21st birthday a couple days after New Years. Thanks in advance! Have a great Christmas, wildcats! ",

For bars: if you're looking for more partying/dancing I'd say check out Tate's, Johnny Kaws, or Tubbys. A couple smaller bars I really like are Mojos and So Longs. The ball drop is by where Rally House is so try to plan on being at a bar somewhat close to there around midnight so you can just step out and watch the countdown.",

I presume it will continue to be in front of Varney's, now Rally House.\n\nAs far as bars go, if you're primary goal is to drink, I always recommend Auntie Mae's. There drinks are usually a little more expensive (but not horribly so) but they're typically stronger and better crafted than most of the other options in Aggieville.\n\nIf your primary interest is dancing and/or trying to pick up women, you have numerous options depending on which STDs you prefer. But, really, all the bars are within a couple of blocks of each other, so you can scout the entire place in less than 10 minutes and see which scene looks like your style.",

They have good bartenders, good drinks, and good music, which is the only thing I care about.",

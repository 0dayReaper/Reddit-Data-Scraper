He doesn\u2019t OWN K-State football and he doesn\u2019t get to hold it hostage to decide what happens next.\n\nI very clearly remember the Prince years. While I don\u2019t think RP was the answer (the hiring practice that brought him in was flat wrong) it sure didn\u2019t help that Bill had an office still inside Vanier the whole time!

    "postText": "A couple of days ago I received an email from my GTA after giving him an unfavorable teval. In the email, he accused me of being dishonest, bad at English, and many other things, and ends with \"giving me 1 in my teval\" doesn't affect me.\" I think this is unprofessional and very petty for an instructor. I sent an email to the teval office and they told me that I should contact the department head. Is it worth contacting the department head, or should I just leave the matter as is?\n\nUpdate: feel like I omitted an important information, the professor of the class is also the head of the department\nUpdate2: The department head decided a warning would be sufficient since he hasnt had a complaint like this before",

My first Calc 2 recitation teacher spoke English so poorly that I switched to a 7:30am section just to have a chance. Most people I knew in that old section struggled immensely, but at least the department listened and didn't keep him around. I get that you would feel guilty, but think about it more I f helping the others who would take that class later.",

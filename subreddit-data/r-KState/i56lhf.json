    "postText": "Hi! If anyone has taken calc 1 and has time to answer, I'd really appreciate it if you could send any advice my way! I'm going to be a senior, and Calc 1 has been on the back burner for a while for me. The syllabus says there won't be calculators allowed for exams, which are going to be zoom recorded. I have no idea what calculus even is, but I thought a calculator would be necessary. I took precalc in high school, but that was a very long time ago. I did fine, but I did not enjoy it. Is this class going to be the bane of my existence? I wish I could find a way around it, but I need it to graduate with my major. Thanks in advance!",

The one thing that students struggle with most in these classes is actually not the new, calculus, material, but being too rusty with the pre-reqs like college algebra and trig. \n\nIf I could offer any advice it would be to take these next few weeks to brush up on college algebra and trigonometry. I'd suggest looking at Khan academy and go through a few lessons in those categories to refresh yourself. \n\nThe no calculator thing isn't really a big deal since this class isn't so much about multiplying large numbers or big exponents  or anything (things that require a calculator), but instead using rules of derivatives and integrals to solve problems.",

I was already rusty since it'd been well over a decade since I took high school algebra (I'm old) and I barely learned anything in the class, and to top it all off, I'll be even rustier when I do take calc a million years from now (because apparently my fate is to be in college forever I guess...). I kinda just wanna keep studying algebra in the background all along, but I'm so bad at math, I don't even know where to start. I kinda wish there was an app or something that just constantly pooped out practice problems...",

            "comment": "It\u2019s scary to think that calculators won\u2019t be allowed, but the numbers they will give you on the exam are all easily calculable without one. The main focus is on understanding the formulas and how to apply them. If you don\u2019t understand the formulas or the concepts then having a calculator on the exam wouldn\u2019t help you anyways because you wouldn\u2019t know what to multiply or divide anyways. Don\u2019t stress the calculator and just focus on learning how to apply the concepts. I hate math and I really struggled with it and I survived math 220 at K-State a few semesters ago. \n\nA resource that I found super useful was a website called symbolab. If I didn\u2019t really understand a concept or how to work through a problem I used their excellent calculus calculators to basically solve the problem for me and then I could see the steps and it helped me better understand it.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve done any trig. It doesn\u2019t play a huge role in much of the course form what I remember, but you will get into trig integrals and derivatives. Not a bad idea to brush up on some of the basics or at least print you out a trig cheat sheet when the time comes.",

When I took Calc 1, my recitation teacher was very intelligent and always willing to help, but the language barrier made it very difficult for me to learn from him.\n\n2. Use the SAS tutors the engineering department provides. Not sure how it will work with COVID, but they used to just have a schedule and you could look up what times there would be a tutor present for Calc. Great resource I didn't take enough advantage of in my early days.\n\n3. Complete and turn in all the homework. Seems simple enough, but one or two skipped assignments can be more detrimental than you think.\n\n4. If you feel like you're not \"getting it\" speak up early to your professor. They're more likely to help you early in the semester, and if you're just taking this cause you have to in order to graduate, there's a good chance they'll take pity on you and give you just enough points to pass the class.",

It was harder at K-State but it was still very understandable. It\u2019s not really comparable to Pre-Calc at all, that class is more just advanced algebra and trig. The most important things from that class that you learned are going to be your trig functions and your unit circle. I had a good experience with Calc 1 here so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much if I were you. I think it\u2019s one of the more interesting and easy to follow math classes I\u2019ve taken. \n\nI say this all as someone who *hated* Pre-Calc too. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hard class, you just need to be on top of things like other classes. Not having calculators won\u2019t be too much of an issue because a lot of what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t something you\u2019d want to use a calculator for anyway and the professors know that you\u2019re not going to want to be doing anything too numerically complicated so you won\u2019t have to worry much about that at all.",

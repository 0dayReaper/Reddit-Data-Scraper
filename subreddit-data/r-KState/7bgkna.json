            "comment": "Did University leadership learn nothing from what happened to mizzou? Their freshmen enrollment is down 35%. They're dealing with nothing short of an existential crisis. And for what? \n\nThere's plenty of events supporting the Kstate family already which are around built around things students are actually energized about and can glean meaning from. For example, some of my best memories I made in Manhattan were during open house. Contrast an event like open house with this. How many students actually want to attend this? Who is this for? Seems to me this is just to make university leadership feel like they're doing something and let the identitarians prattle on about their favorite topics: diversity (of skin color) and victimhood. This is not the way to build the Kstate family, this is not the way to recruit the next generation of wildcats, this is stupid. ",

Both of those are the opposite of what happened at MU and hence you got the mess that spiraled out of control there.\n\nIf anything your criticism that the administration is being too hands on shows that it is not at all like MU.\n\nAlso wtf is an identitarian? Seems like a strawman you've made up.",

The university ought to be rising up against the media that was so quick to publicize this event, nationally, as something it wasn\u2019t and then failed to broadcast the truth once the facts were made public. \n\nTrying to create division where there isn\u2019t is a sick game and I\u2019m deeply saddened that the university has decided to toe the identity politics line rather than standing up for the family-like environment that many generations of K-Staters have known and held so dear.\n",

Since this is a week away, it will give plenty of student organizations time to become unhappy with this whole idea and threaten to either not support it or to actively protest the event. One can joke about how a march is ableist, how a daytime march discriminated against vampirekin, or how \u201cfamily\u201d is a tool of the patriarchy, man... but just wait. I would be willing to bet that trying to figure out the details of this event is a bit like having ten bakers make a cake. \n\nI\u2019ve seen it before... in Lawrence, some high schoolers spontaneously decided to hold a rally after last year\u2019s election. As soon as it gained steam, people started picking apart the event for not being inclusive enough, for having too many non-PoC speakers, for some groups not being included in the planning. The vitriol aimed at the kids was unreal and, eventually, they gave up because it wasn\u2019t worth the stress.\n\nThis is potentially worse. If student groups protest, it will create terrible visuals and a continuing narrative that KSU is headed down a destructive path. Remember the images of the MU president being blocked and heckled at their homecoming? How did that play? Regardless of how many students attend - and my guess is most will stay away - people will point to the lack of support among non-marginalized students... the list of potential problems is almost endless with very little upside.\n\nFinally, you\u2019ve cancelled a day worth of classes that will disrupt countless schedules. Some people have Tuesday only classes. Some people commute. Some people spend their own money and expect a return for that money - what about those people?\n\n(edit to add: I hope my predictions don\u2019t come true. I hope it goes smoothly and everyone holds hands and cries together... but it won\u2019t)\n\nAll of this feels like a poorly thought out attempt to have a group hug and no one stopped to think about the risk/reward.",

But with attitudes like that, I bet they will be instantly hired by just about any major news organization in the US, considering how things are currently going.\n\nI just graduated in May, and honestly this whole thing has pissed me the hell off. The Collegian and certain groups on campus seem to be hellbent on finding something, ANYTHING, they can use to try and gain power for themselves in a mad dash to be the next \"victim\", even though no such problem exist. And while there is not much I can do about it now that I am graduated, I will be telling the Alumni assosication that if they want my money they need to pass along to the admins that they need to stop trying to cave to this sort of shit and lay the smackdown on those who would seek to drag my university through the mud for their own ends.",

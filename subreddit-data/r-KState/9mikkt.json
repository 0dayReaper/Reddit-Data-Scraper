    "postText": "29 year old, thinking about going back to school. Feed science major really looks interesting. I don't have any specific questions about it, I just wanted to get the impression of the major from a current student. Like it? Hate it? School is always hard work, but what's your impression of the difficulty? Lots of book learning vs hands on? Etc etc. Just general impressions ",

Good mix of hands on and in class learning, lots of opportunities for internships, and great starting pay and 100% job placement. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk more. ",

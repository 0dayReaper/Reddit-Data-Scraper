My current rent rate is\u00a0$519 a month\u00a0and my lease ends on July 31st, 2020\\*\\*.\\*\\*\u00a0\u00a0You will be responsible for electricity. The average for electricity is about\u00a0$45\u00a0per month but that might change depending on how much you use.\u00a0 The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable, and internet.\u00a0 Another great thing about reletting is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my relet and you can move into\u00a0any\u00a0apartment within the complex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me at [kaylahbrown23@gmail.com](mailto:kaylahbrown23@gmail.com) **.**\u00a0\u00a0If you would like to set up a tour or have any additional questions you can contact the leasing manager at 785-539-0500.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",

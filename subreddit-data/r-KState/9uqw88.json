    "postText": "I heard through a friend of a friend that if you complete the Introduction to Wines course, you will be able to get certified as a Level 1 sommelier at the end of Advanced Wines (the follow-up class).\n\nIs there any truth to this? Trying to fill out my final semester with an elective or two, and becoming a sommelier would be a neat extra certificate to get from K-State. ",

    "postText": "My daughter is in her senior year in HS in Missouri. She has applied to Kstate and was accepted but she did not meet the academic requirements to get instate tuition. I am wondering if there is anyone here who has experience and/or advice in establishing residency after their first year so they could get instate tuition for the remaining years of school. We have family in Kansas so we are considering having her move in with them right after HS to begin the one year KS resident requirement. She'll get a KS driver's license and register to vote in KS.  What else do we need to do? And will the school accept this and flip her to instate tuition for the remainder of her schooling at KState?",

Basically have to sit out of school for 18 months to gain that magic residency.",

You can ask for a delay once accepted to meet that requirement.\nCall it the most pedestrian gap-year ever! I did exactly that when I came to KS for school myself (but that was in 1996.) The biggest problem I had was finding a job in a college town for that year, honestly!\n\nAlso, do be aware that my understanding was that if you move to KS to go to K-State and start out as a out-of-state student, they will not reclassify you in a year unless you have some sort of other reason for being in KS. So if your whole family moves here, they'd probably be willing to change your classification. If it's just a student alone, though, they'll probably want to charge them nonresident tuition for all 4 years. It's a \"reason/intent to stay after graduation\" that they're looking for.\n\nGood luck!",

You have to have moved to Kansas for reasons other than school and have established residency with a Kansas address (on a DL) for 12 months without being enrolled at all. If she gets a job and pays taxes in the state of Kansas proving this residency is significantly easier. There's no way to get around that 12 months of official residency without going to school. Unfortunately you can't just go to school and pay out-of-state for a year while you have the KS address then pay in-state the next year (can't flip for the remainder). For me, that year sitting out ended up not being worth it coming from a state with super high in-state tuition. Hope this helps!",

The \u201cpoint\u201d of the organization is allegedly to bring more conservatism to college campuses. Ironically it was started by a guy who never went to college and it\u2019s funded by billionaires who use the organization to promote their ideals specifically. \n\nHere are some quick bullet points:\n\n-at least one chapter has worked to bring Nick Fuentes, a far right media face who has had a history of ties with people such as Richard Spencer, to their campus. \n\n-a former higher-up, Candace Owens has made statements saying white nationalism isn\u2019t bad. \n\n-a former member has spent time working with Nick Fuentes and another far-right media member Baked Alaska\n\nAt lower levels, though it\u2019s generally not full white nationalism, there have been repeat instances of widespread racism, islamophobia, and xenophobia, with Charlie Kirk himself often pushing these ideas through his speeches and social media. Also beyond this, Kirk worked directly with Donald Trump during his time leading TPUSA, pretty much allowing a direct line of propaganda. \n\nSo pretty much, TPUSA is not necessarily white nationalist or really even far-right. In fact, Charlie Kirk (the head) tries to distance himself from right-wing fringe groups, to the point of clashing with many of them. It\u2019s that college-aged members and several higher-ups tend to have ties to these groups and that the organization (though maybe accidentally) attract far right people. Surface-level it sounds harmless but when you consider how huge the group actually is and who is behind it all, it becomes a lot clearer that we don\u2019t need anyone like this on our campus. \n\nHere are some sources:\n\n[MMFA](https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/short-history-turning-point-usas-racism) \n\n[SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/02/16/turning-point-usas-blooming-romance-alt-right) \n\n[Huffington Post](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5cd58fdbe4b0796a95dac4f6/amp) \n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Point_USA)",

Regardless The core of TP is conservatism Which happens to be the core of white nationalism right? Isnt that the line they are using as a connection? What I am saying is people take the core of socialism which is sharing on a national level which happens to be the core of communism.",

In fact, white nationalism isn't compatible with conservatism. The primary values of conservatism are fiscal responsibility and small government and free market economics. In fact, the GOP was founded on the Abolition of Slavery in direct Opposition to classic Southern Democrats.\n\nMeanwhile, the core of national socialism is that individuality is counter-productive to the state, racial purity is the only way to achieve a peaceful society, the idea that we need to return to our formal glory, but that the past had it wrong. We need to take a new way forward. Their way forward. That is the only way we are going to survive the threat posed by &lt;insert target group here&gt;. Private enterprise is allowed, but it is expected to be at the mercy of the government, and the state will be strongest when these things are absolutely enforced on everyone.\n\nThe ideas of national socialism and conservatism are directly opposed. That being said, how these two movements have started to merge at the fringes is really worth examining.\n\nThe connections are being drawn due to white nationalist leaders' desire to reframe their movement in order to develop a stronger power base in the country. If you look at some of their primary spokespeople, they tend to be exceptionally attractive, well-spoken, clean-cut and just all-around likable people, until you start breaking down their message.\n\nAdd to this the open associations with white-supremecist groups, and the coded white supremacist ideals (such as AmericaFirst's founding idea that they want to \"fight against the globalist agenda). It falls in line with the idea that there is a group of Zionist Jews who are working towards world domination. \n\nJust as a very pertinent statement here: It is important to recognize that these white supremacist groups are all about using symbology and codes. It is a part of their culture. Bad stuff tends to happen to them when they are exposed. They are fired. They are shunned from society. So many seek to hide it. That is why watering it down, and encoding it as they are is so dangerous. I've been around this shit enough and paid enough attention to it to know it when I see it.",

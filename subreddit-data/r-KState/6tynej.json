    "postText": "I am in search for a subleasor for my apartment starting August 2017.\nI can tell you a little bit about the apartment complex. The name is University Crossing apartments located at 2215 College Ave. Manhattan, Kansas 66502. It's located just a walking distance away from the football stadium. My current rent rate is $420 and my lease ends on July 31st 2018. The only utilities that you will be responsible for is electricity and water and the average for both is about $30 per month. The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable and wireless internet. Another great thing about subleasing is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my subleasor and you can move into any apartment within the complex.\nIf you are interested, please contact me at 785-473-8636. If you would like to set up a tour or have any additional questions you can contact the leasing manage Michael Hodge at 785-539-0500 or mhodge@clsliving.com\n\nHere are some of the great amenities that they include in your monthly price!\n24-hour Fitness Center\n24-hour Computer Lab with FREE Printing \nWasher &amp; Dryer in each unit\nFree Tanning\nBasketball Court\nTennis Court\nOutdoor, in-ground Pool\nClubhouse including Pool Table and TV (cable provided)\nPatio Area with Barbecue Grill\nOn-Site Management &amp; Maintenance\nIndividual Leasing\nFully Furnished Apartments\nOn-Site Parking\nRoommate Matching Service\nFree Shuttle Service to Kansas State University\nFree Coffee Bar located in the Leasing Office",

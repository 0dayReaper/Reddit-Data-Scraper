He assigned 2 hours of homework and 1 - 2 hours of reading every class, so three times a week, among having to study for the weekly quizzes. I was taking it as an unrestricted elective so that's not exactly what I was looking for but I've heard people have had much better experiences through other instructors.",

            "comment": "I took 625, but that was back in 2009. If I remember correctly, it would start off with basic concurrency concepts, then you would move on to multi-threading in Java, then you would move to various topics in distributed systems such as MapReduce and Service Oriented Architecture. That was 8 years ago, so I would assume they might have changed some if not most of it. The first half of the class was taught be professor Wallentine, and the second half was taught by professor Andresen, who is actually an outstanding professor. I think professor Wallentine might have retired though.      \n     \nI have also taken Gen Psych, but that was back in my freshman year, 2006 haha. Fun class and easy, but you will be surrounded by a lot of freshman though, which isn't necessarily bad. ",

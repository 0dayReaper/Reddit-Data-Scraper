    "postText": "Hi everyone. My friend and I signed a lease to live together in a house, but she accepted a job in South Dakota and so we are needing to find someone to take the lease over ASAP. It's a nice, historic house, good area, well-priced, but way too big for me alone. It's located on 5th and Kearney, 4 bedrooms (plus a main floor room that could also be a bedroom), large basement, washer/dryer, garage, and a double lot so it has a HUGE yard. Pet friendly, monthly rent is $1095. It's well kept up and honestly, we were able to negotiate the rent down/get some stuff (like pet fees and washer/dryer fees) removed entirely.\n\nIf anyone is interested let me know! Lease runs from August 1st - July 31st, 2019. There are application fees that are associated with the property management company, but we'd be willing to pay those if we can get this rented before the 1st!",

There are other cheaper water efficient toilets.\n\nI wouldn't mind having a bidet integrated toilet but I doubt if I'd use it.

However, how do they clean the mud off their vehicle? With a hose or a dry towel?\n\nThey'd clean it with a hose because it cleans better than dry towels ever could. Same goes for bidets vs. TP.\n\nI guess unless the student body population understands the benefits of bidets vs. TP, they'll not want it based on ignorance.\n\nJapanese and Korean students would welcome a piece of home-away-from-home, and students from well-to-do Middle Eastern countries would too.",

If K-State won't start bidets at Wefald Hall, no telling when they'll ever get on the bandwagon. They may likely become the first university in America to have them!\n\n&gt; And not everyone in Europe/ Asia/ Middle East uses bidets.\n\nWonder if they're stigmatized like Americans who wouldn't use TP are.\n\nEveryone needs to use them for the sake of the environment. (Water is treatable and recyclable; TP not so much.)\n\nBesides, less demand on TP thanks to the water's benefits would save K-State some $ (and reduce our tuition hikes.) Water is cheaper in the long run; they don't need trucking in like TP does.\n\n&gt; I've used a bidet and lived where they are standard.\n\nHow much do you miss them nowadays? (I'd never wanna go back to the old way either.) Have you asked your landlord for permission to have one installed?",

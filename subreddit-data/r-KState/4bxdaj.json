We may have a decent amount of profit but a school like Texas has vastly more overall revenue than we do. Do you think they're concerned about total profit? Additionally, it's easy to make money when your football team has been trending up the last two decades. What happens when we have some actually bad years yet are still on the hook for the operating costs of a good team? Say goodbye to that revenue. Regardless of the financial aspect, though, you have to remember that Currie's been responsible for multiple PR nightmares and has yet to own up to any of them. Finally, he hired Bruce Weber, his intended mark on this university, and that's gone terribly. We can't fire Bruce without Currie, and I'm happy to see both of them go ",

    "postText": "Hi there!  I'll be attending K-State this fall as a graduate student.  I haven't had the chance to visit Manhattan yet, and I was wondering if any current grad students had any recommendations of good places to live, landlords/management to avoid, etc (Google hasn't been super helpful).  I'm looking for something pet-friendly.  Housemates are OK.  My budget is pretty tight - I have a stipend, but it's not much.  I have a car, but I'd rather walk or bike to campus.\n\nMuch appreciated!  I'm really looking forward to studying at K-State :)",

If I remember correctly, they have a placement program that will put you in an apartment with other people who are like you, similar to incoming freshman living in the dorms. I would suggest not to live in the \"Traditional Apartments\" unless you are really on a tight budget.\n\nIf you decide to live off campus, K-State has tons of housing within walking distance to campus, and it is a very pedestrian friendly campus. Most landlords are hit and miss. My one to avoid is named Rodger Seymour.",

I would recommend reaching out to your department and asking if they can connect you with other incoming grad students who are looking for housing. When I was a grad student I was the president of our grad org and this was a common task that the department asked me to do.",

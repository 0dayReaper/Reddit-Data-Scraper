A timeline of what should be accomplished. That would help give some peace of mind for fans.\n\nMost likely Snyder will stay on for at least 1 more year. But I would like to see improvement in recruiting. I would like to hear Snyder give a honest discussion of his plans. I know he doesn't owe us that.\n\nLet the dust settle and hopefully hear something later in 2019.",

Some of us are vested in the Manhattan community or Kansas in general, and some are not. But no one is a \"true\" fan. We are all bandwagon fans of K-State football based on Snyder's success.",

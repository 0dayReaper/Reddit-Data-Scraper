These classes can meet online, during nights, or occasionally during weekends.  For classes that do meet in person, I believe most, if not all, meet in Manhattan on K-State's normal campus.",

If the course schedule lists an actual classroom as the meeting place then I would suspect that to be the case.  \n\n\nI think I would need more information here to say for sure, because Global Campus runs a number of programs.",

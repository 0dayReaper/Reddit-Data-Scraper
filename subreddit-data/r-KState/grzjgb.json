They're a little more pricey than other apartments/houses, but they're close to campus and owned by the school, so you're not dealing with crappy management. Look up K-State's housing and dining for when you need to apply and get into the apartments, if they're going to be open.",

My only other suggestion might be Jardine, which is student housing, but is right by The Bill so you can tailgate and have beers and have a really convenient and easy walk to the stadium if you decide to go.",

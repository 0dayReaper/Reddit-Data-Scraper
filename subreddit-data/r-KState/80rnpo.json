    "postText": "Hello, I am searching for a subleasor for my apartment starting August 18th, 2018. The name of the apartments is the Gramercy Apartments. Your lease would begin on August 18th, 2018 and that is when you would move in. The current rent is $349 per month. The only utilities you are responsible for is electricity and water and the average of both is about $30 per month. The rent rate includes trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable and internet. This is a sublease and you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I would be living in, all you have to do it agree to be my subleasor and you can move into any apartment in the complex. \nIf you are interested contact me, Meghan LeMay, by \nemail: mlemay222@gmail.com or by \nphone: 785-466-1256. \nIf you would like to set up a tour or have any additional questions contact the leasing manager at 785-539-0500.\n\nAmenities: \nFully Furnished\nWIFI Internet Included\nRoommate Matching Service\n24 hour Police Patrol and On-Call Emergency Assistance\nIndividual Leasing Contracts\nWasher &amp; Dryer Included in Each Unit\nNew Stainless Steel Appliances in Each Unit\nPool with Towel and Lotion Service\nFull Size Tennis, Basketball, and Volleyball courts\nFitness Center\nJoe's Coffee Bar\nFree Tanning Services\nOn-site Parking\nFree Shuttle Service to Kansas State University\nWalking Distance from Football Stadium",

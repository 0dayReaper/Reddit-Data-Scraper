    "postText": "I'm about to accept a fraternity bid and want to move into the house ASAP but I am in a 4 man Jardine apartment and don't want to screw over my roommates. The 3 that remain are super easy to get along with and it's in building 3, across the street from the rec and right on Denison avenue, so about as close to campus as you're going to get.\n\nThe bedroom I'm offering has a view of the pond/fountain from the window and there are 2 full bathrooms in the apartment with 2 sinks each so you get your own area for shaving, contact lenses, etc.\n\nWay cheaper than the dorms, still on campus... If you are interested or know anyone who is please PM me :)\n\nThanks Cats!",

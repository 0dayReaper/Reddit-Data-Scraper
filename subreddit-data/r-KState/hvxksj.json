    "postText": "Hello all! I hope you are all staying safe and healthy. I am a PhD student hoping to do research on (im)migration to the United States and was hoping to find out if you consider your city/town in the Midwest to know how to break up our country. [Here](https://forms.gle/w4q3SjcF1YYTBaCZA) you will find a brief Google Survey. I am not collecting your data or emails, as all demographic questions except where you live are optional questions. Thank you very much, and do not hesitate to email me (mitchel.13@osu.edu) with any questions!",

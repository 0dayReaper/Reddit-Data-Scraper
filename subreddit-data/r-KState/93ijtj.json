He said that target date remains the same, and cleaning all the physical materials could take just as long.\n\n\u201cIt may be 12 to 18 months to get everything cleaned,\u201d Haddock said. \u201cIn addition to the building not being ready for at least 18 months, it\u2019s also the collections cleaned to get them back in. As they clean, they have to put the clean boxes someplace because we can\u2019t put them back in the building while they\u2019re renovating. It\u2019s this logistical nightmare, almost.\u201d\u201d\n\nhttps://www.kstatecollegian.com/2018/07/24/more-storage-space-needed-as-hales-collection-is-recovered-cleaned-after-fire/",

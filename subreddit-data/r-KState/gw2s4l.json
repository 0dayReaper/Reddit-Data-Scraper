I think there was a data dump of racist groups' chat messages where somebody claimed they had put up posters at several Kansas universities, but it's been long enough since that news broke that I'm not finding it by googling. I think it was also unclear if or where they were attending college.\n\nI will say that you'd be unlikely to even know that bulletin board existed unless you were familiar with Seaton and had reason to be there, but it's also possible it was just a target of opportunity. The Denison poster was at the street crossing between Goodnow and the rest of campus. Again, likely a target of opportunity.\n\nK-State ended up putting up cameras covering that entrance into Seaton a few months later because of a different incident where some students caused some damage (unrelated to racism) and also ended up locking most of the buildings doors at night except for where they had cameras. Made it annoying as hell to find convenient parking and get into my lab at night.",

We can probably assume the advisor is white. Unless they encouraged non-black students to pursue double majors while questioning the OP, this isn't racism. \n\nSome people are just assholes. In this case, it's the advisor (certainly some K-Stater has double majored before). Unfortunately, because of their experience with actual racism, too many POC claim racism when the other person is just being a dick.",

Most teachers are prejudiced in their teaching even if they don't know it consciously. They favor the white kids and pay less attention to the brown and black kids. So when someone in the system is discouraging towards a PoC it's far more likely to be prejudiced than genuine.\n\nBecause also, a lot of people have graduated with two degrees, so it's BS advice.",

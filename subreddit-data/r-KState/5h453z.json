I mean check out how freakin cool [this cap](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/4j7759/georgia_tech_student_graduates_wearing_a_cap/) that got shared on /r/cfb was.\n\nBut here's the thing, many schools that do that generally have a tradition where a large majority of students decorate caps. We don't, and as others have pointed out just a few students doing it does not look very good.\n\nGraduation is YOUR day, but you are sharing it during the ceremony with dozens to hundreds of other people.\n\nAlso, this line is very important:\n\n&gt; the only cords that may be worn are those that pertain to scholastic honors and other K-State honors.\n\nI know at other colleges students wear decorations that are not directly affiliated with the university (many just for photos however). But at K-State there is a codified system for gowns and awards.\n\nI graduated with a master's degree. This means I had a special gown different from the regular undergrad gowns and a hood with the color of my College (your tassel will also have the color of your college- another reason for less cap clutter). There were also people at the ceremony receiving doctorate degrees. They wore even more elaborate gowns and cords in addition to a special honorary cap that is notably different and more decorated than ordinary caps. The doctorate cap is a very distinctive and special honor, and I could see how visually and ceremonially it would be lessened if everyone else had unique and obviously striking caps.\n\nMaybe you will be at an all undergrad ceremony, but the people conferring the degrees will most likely be doctors in their field and wearing full regalia. For many reasons its important to make them visually separate from the  rest of the assembled.\n\nI understand your frustration. I would have had a ball decorating my own cap. But for some very important reasons that have been in practice at Kansas State* for over a hundred years we do not decorate caps. Could that change in the future? Sure. But for now I suggest respecting the tradition or trying to create a creative discussion on the matter instead of dismissing it.\n\nAnyways, congratulations on graduating! Hail, hail hail, Alma Mater!\n\n*I put an asterisk here for a bonus fact for getting through my wall of text: your diploma will read Kansas State University of Agriculture and Applied Sciences- the actual full name of K-State.",

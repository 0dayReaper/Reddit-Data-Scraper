            "comment": "&gt;This was Sunday, around 2pm.\n&gt;\n&gt;I had earplugs in so I didn't hear the shot, but one of the responding officers was in the area and heard it. When questioned, Duncan admitted to shooting the ca because it was in his yard. But not just that, it's also the end (hopefully) of 3 years of harassments and abuses waged by Duncan against his neighbors and their pets. I have informed him and his spouse on more that one occasion that it is a felony to deprive people of their pets. Despite doing so, this is the third cat I have lost. A close neighbor has lost one. And a less-close neighbor has lost 3+ in the last several years. All the strays have also disappeared from the area.\n&gt;\n&gt;I've tried putting up cameras. Tracking devices on collars. Lobbying the city government. Pleading with the Pottawatomie County Sheriffs Office to put a foot down and set the record straight on what the law is. But no. This had to happen. I had to wait and dread the day Duncan took things too far.\n&gt;\n&gt;That day was Sunday, and it was more terrible than I could have anticipated.\n  \n[Crosspost](https://themercury.com/news/k-state-professor-arrested-for-animal-cruelty-in-pottawatomie-county/article_b6991bbd-3ce4-5b1f-bbc5-3749b9248d4e.html)",

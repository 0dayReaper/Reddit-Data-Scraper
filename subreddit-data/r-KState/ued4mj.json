He told us he was retired but they pulled him out to teach because of how crazy the election was going to be (Trump vs. Hillary). He let us know he was dying, and that he didn't really give a shit about how the school wanted him to teach. Ans his lectures were totally unhinged, in the best way. Politics can't be taught in a vacuum",

I had not heard of his passing.  \n\nI didnt think he went off on tangents but my degree is in PoliSci so those were all relevant things to me. Lots of politics goes off on rabbit trails.  I do understand that people taking his classes from other programs struggled to see the connections at times.  I had a Elementary ED major who sat next to me for one of his classes who carefully copied everything he put on the white board which was of course a mess of random words and circles.  She actually answered quiz question with one of those diagrams. \n\nHe was a great professor and I am saddened to hear he died.",

            "comment": "I'm living in Jardine currently, though I won't be next semester for reasons unrelated to Jardine. I don't know about the dimensions of a renovated one bedroom because I've only lived in a four bedroom.\n\nOverall, I think it's a nice place to live. The surroundings are nice, you get free wifi, and depending on what apartment you live in, you may also get free water and/or free electricity. There's also plenty of space, the doors are lockable, the kitchen is decent (though it only has one drawer), and it's leagues better than the dorms in terms of price and privacy imo.\n\nMost of the complaints I've heard about Jardine are that it's more expensive that similar apartments off campus, which seems to be more or less true, though not in my opinion by an exorbitant amount.\n\nA few things to know if you do decide to live here(mobile formatting, hopefully it doesn't look too bad):\n-pets aren't really allowed, though it seems like you can get around that if the animal is for emotional support?\n\n-some apartments have a washer and dryer in them. Some don't\n\n-because the wifi is K-State wifi, you're not allowed to host a server off of it (may or may not affect you)\n\n-if you do live in a multi-bedroom apartment, you should know that Jardine doesn't assign roommates at all, so you'll need to get that figured out yourself beforehand.\n\n-the contract is from July 1 through the end of June, so basically the whole year. This means you can stay over the summer fine without moving out at all if you stay in the same apartment the next year. This is pretty useful if you plan to work in Manhattan while school is on break.\n\nEdit: formatting",

If you\u2019re on a standard jardine contract for an apartment for 12 months, you\u2019ll pay electricity. If you\u2019re on a \u201cdorm-style\u201d contract (used to be called Living Community, where you\u2019re assigned roommates and your agreement covers the academic year, not summer) you don\u2019t pay electric. Nobody pays water to my knowledge.\n\nBut ask housing@ksu.edu and they\u2019ll know :)",

The internet is basically in the rent anyway. It's not the best internet but it works just fine. The only other bill beyond rent is electric through Evergy. If you have an account through them, it's easy to switch.\n\nDo be aware there are fire alarms (drills). Twice per semester. One during the day and one at night. They try to make sure they are at more convenient times for everyone (for us at least they were). \n\nThey do not come furnished. As far as I know, Gramercy is the only furnished place.",

The modern or myself and my roommate is $610 a month is $3660 for a semester. That is for 2Be 1Ba. It is I think $50-75 less expensive per month for additional rooms (3 Bed I think is 530 a month? Or 3180 per semester I think).  Remember this includes all internet, trash, etc. But you pay electric separate. There are families that live in the modern ones, but i've seen more international students and families in the traditional buildings.\n\nPersonally, I like Jardine because it's not like you're paying a ton for COX internet and Jardine has easy access to the bus route (which stops on both sides of Jardine!). Jardine is also good because you have the cornerstone and JPs in the complex. It is usually more stable on campus than it is off campus I have found.",

JPs is a restaurant with burgers, salads, and other foods. For the washer and dryer I think it is $1.75 or $2 per load to wash and $1.75 or $2 to dry. HDS allows you to use Cat Cash (put money on your ID card) to use for that. At least in the dorms they did. I am not sure as I don't use it. I didn't have a good experience off-campus but that was likely because the roommate I had was not great at the time and there were parties at a different building and police were there frequently. The roommate is had was also not a student so that was a dividing line. I've found campus living to be more reliable in terms of it's mostly quiet and there aren't many, if any, police occurrences (not where I live anyway). Also, the people that live here are either students (Undergrad, Masters or PhD) or people who do research, usually for the college of agriculture.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, my name is Patrick and I own an esports consulting company called All On Esports Activators. My passion is building esports programs on college campuses. I think every school in the country can benefit from an esports program and I'd love to see one at K-state. One of the biggest challenges for college administrations making the leap into esports is not knowing how many students really want an esports program. This program can include anything from a school funded club all the way to a varsity team that gives scholarships to its players. To address this challenge, I have started a survey that I'm hoping you guys would be willing to take. I'm trying to get this survey to as many schools as possible. \n\nIf you'd like to take it, follow the link below and you'll have the option to sign up to take the survey and also an option to get the results as well. The survey will be emailed out a couple weeks from now.\n\nThanks!\n\nLink:  [https://aoeactivators.com/home/aoe-activators-collegiate-esports-winter-survey/](https://aoeactivators.com/home/aoe-activators-collegiate-esports-winter-survey/)",

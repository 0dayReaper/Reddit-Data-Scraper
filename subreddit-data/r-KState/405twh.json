I don't think you'll have an issue with others if you're social (and if not people won't give you problems). Just realize your going to be with kids who have never been at college before and also aren't legally old enough to drink, so you can't really go to the bars with them. \n\nThere will be some age differences but I am sure everyone will be friendly. It really depends what you are looking for. \n\nThe dorms are a good way to meet people really easily but if you want more friends your age or with a certain interest it might be better to join clubs or attend events.",

I lived in the dorms for two years so I was one of the older(ish) kids by the end.\n\nI enjoyed my time both years but it was time for me to move out. For some two years is too much. For others its three years.\n\nBut yeah, I think the age difference is bigger between 19 and 21 than say 21 and 23.\n",

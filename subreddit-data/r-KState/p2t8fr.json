At the very least you'll get customer service experience and experience working with many different kinds of people.\n\nBoth Derby and Kramer are majorly understaffed right now. Since it's an on campus job it will work completely around your class schedule.",

It's a college town most jobs will work with your schedule. \n\nYou might talk to your advisor see what they think based on your current load and if they can get you into the door of helping anything on campus.",

            "comment": "You're out of luck, unfortunately. The only Italian restaurants are Four Olives (high end, no delivery) and Olive Garden (low end, still no delivery). Della Voce is in between (closer to 4 Olives) quality-wise but not strictly Italian, nor do they deliver either. \n\nAside from pizza joints, the only Italian you can have delivered is the pasta from GoodCents. I love their sandwiches but their pasta is decidedly low rent. \n\nFor other options, [Wildcat2Go](http://www.wildcat2go.com) delivers from ~30 restaurants. I recommend Mr. K's for high quality but not overpriced food. You can always take Uber, as well. If you mention where your staying, I  can ler you know what's within walking distance, as well. ",

It was originally located in the west side shopping center where Ray's Apple Market used to be. A few years ago, it moved downtown where the Salvation Army Thrift Store used to be until they moved over to Poyntz.",

I stayed after class one day to get help on an assignment and there was a girl in front of me who did the same. She asked some questions that I thought were completely fair (not the topics that I had issues with, but I could understand how someone would have questions) and that dick absolutely goes off on a huge rant and ends with \u201cAll of this is so simple and basic. IF YOU DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND THESE BASIC CONCEPTS YOU SHOULD NOT BE MAJORING IN ECONOMICS.\u201d So the poor girl squeaks, \u201cBut... I am not majoring in economics... I am just here because it is required.\u201d\n\nI finally just left. He ripped that girl such a gaping new one that I wanted nothing to do with him, and didn\u2019t want to give him the opportunity to do the same to me. I don\u2019t know if he thought this was like an honors class full of Econ students or what, but he was just an awful teacher.",

He is remembering the way it never was. I lost points on assignments and discussion boards because I challenged this thinking.\n\nFor example, in one of his lectures, he was describing how nice things were in the 90s when you had to go somewhere, and instead of using GPS, you would go into a gas station and ask for directions. The way I remember this time, was being lost in the bad part of town and my friends and I screaming at each other because nobody knew the way out, and large groups of shady looking people were hanging out in gas station parking lots.\n\nHe seems to hate technology, and myself, at almost 40, I love technology and embrace it completely, it has changed our world for the better, but he goes on and on about how wonderful New Guinea is because they don't use technology.\n\nIn one of the assignments, students had to walk up to random strangers and ask them personal questions about their lives. When I challenged this and said this might not be a good idea for some of the younger traditional college women to do, it was met with \"bad stuff doesn't happen in Manhattan\".......I assure you bad stuff does happen in Manhattan.\n\nHis weird podcast thing about \"sneaking into a college party for anthropology reasons\" struck me the wrong way, trust me dude, a 40 year-old at a college party will stand out, you aren't tricking anyone.\n\nThese are just my experiences, if you guys enjoy his class I'm happy for you and glad you are getting something out of it. It was a requirement for my degree. I ended up with a 95% in his class.",

Working in the library freshmen year to learning the news thus summer it saddens me anytime I walk by it or hear anything about it.\n\nI am here to highly recommend to go to the source as I know that there are a lot of rumors floating around about our beloved library. The nice people over at @kstatelibraries have started a blog \n[Hale Library Blog](http://blogs.k-state.edu/hale/)\n\nThanks everyone and if you haven't already donated I would highly recommend it.\n\nGo Cats!\n",

I dropped a delivery there in early May (I'm a wildcat2go driver) and I never thought it'd be my last time seeing the inside of Hale undisturbed. :'(\n\nCan't wait to see it completely restored someday, but in the meantime it's heartbreaking....\n\nOn that note, I'm going back to college in August. I don't know how much I'll need the use of a library in my first semester, but just in case, does any one know what the plan is? I know KU offered their library to us, but that surely doesn't mean we have to drive to Lawrence every time we need a library...",

                    "comment": "K-State has to pay the deductible because K-State filed the claim with the university's insurer. Deductibles are only paid by the insured. Deductibles act as a deterrent to keep the insured from filing small claims. Even though the contractor's accident caused the fire, K-State's property insurer still covers the property and K-State must pay the deductible. K-State's insurer will likely file a claim with the contractor's liability insurer to recoup money to used to pay for repairs on behalf of the university. I should note, things can change and the contractor's general liability company could step up and pay more. \n\nIt's complicated, but hope this kind of makes sense of the situation. The good news is K-State will have a newly renovated Library!",

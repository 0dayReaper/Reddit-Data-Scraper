My current rent rate is\u00a0**399$ per month** **but I'm ready to participate in the rent by paying 50$ each month**.\u00a0My lease ends on\u00a0**July 31st 2020.**\u00a0\u00a0You will be responsible for electricity and water (IF OVER THE $30.00 ALOTTED AMOUNT). The average for electricity is about\u00a035$ per month. The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable, and internet.\u00a0 Another great thing about reletting is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my relet and you can move into\u00a0any\u00a0apartment within the complex.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me at\u00a0**jobkarinemarion@yahoo.fr.**\u00a0\u00a0If you would like to set up a tour or have any additional questions you can contact a Leasing Professional at 785-539-0500.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0f864ip7hg31.jpg?width=275&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=57fb3eac21c02564a9c2256b3474944a769adcee",

Plus I had to walk a mile and a half every day twice to get to the vet school complex.",

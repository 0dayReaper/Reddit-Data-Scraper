Looking for an apartment (I am looking online but figure better ask opinions of which ones are good and which ones to avoid) but I am open to moving in with someone if they are looking for a roommate.\n\nAs a side note I will be in Manhattan on Wednesday.",

It's also just down the street from a Hyvee, so that's nice.  Rent and utilities usually run about $500ish a month.  Pet friendly, too, though my roommate is allergic to cats.  If either of you are interested, let me know and we can get in touch.  ",

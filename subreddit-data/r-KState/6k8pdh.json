They also didn't mention non-building renovations, like the overhaul of Mid Campus Drive and the road between the post office and Seaton.\n\nThis campus has changed drastically since I first came here four years ago.",

                    "comment": "It's top 50, not top 3. But to your broader point:\n\n - 'top' is subjective, and if you define it carefully, it gets easier to win. Very little of the ranking criteria chosen has to do with selectivity.\n - National Academy members are virtually impossible to 'grow' from zero to fifty. Instead you'll need to recruit, and that takes money and opportunities.\n - a stretch goal is something to get the donor base excited about\n - it's going to be very difficult to compete for researchers with larger economies, and more accommodating legislatures (and governor, I guess)\n - this initiative was the previous KSU president's brainchild. but it at least has a deadline.\n",

Gardens are filled with trees, flowers the sound of running water and birds. A short walk to city park provides trees and the sounds of children playing, it's a great place to hammock and clear your mind.",

If not, just taking the stairs beyond the top floor would get peaceful enough. They would have to have gained trust in the boss to get keys.  If you can gain their trust, roof of dorms or, if it's still in the state I remember... the basement to Putnam.  There used to be a full kitchen just for that hall and it was basically locked up and forgotten.\n  They also had a pool table room in several of the dorms.  A resident could reserve the room.   A key was checked out and then you could have the room to yourself.\n  I used to be one of those student-workers with key access.",

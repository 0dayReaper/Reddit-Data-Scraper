My co-workers and I are really curious what you guys are making and I told them I'd check here. Thanks for being awesome. ",

Since it's mostly campus housing I would guess intro to comp engineering. I think they have a keypad project in class where they pretend it's an elevator or something. \n\nThanks for working at Digi key! You guys are my fav.",

The parts kits range from intro classes to micro controllers and electronics lab. If it's any consolation this method is a lot better than having the IEEE club order them and sell them for a week.",

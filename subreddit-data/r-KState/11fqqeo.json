He's been a great player, when he is available, as he suffered some sort of injury earlier this season. Since he's returned, he's made some good impacts on the K-State interior defense &amp; provided some offensive power around the rim.\n\nI've got Coach Tang on speed dial so I'll be sure to send him a message right away... just kidding!",

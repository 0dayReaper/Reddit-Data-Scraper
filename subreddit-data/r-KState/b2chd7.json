I might spend 20 bucks, but that is including a beer as well. I'm not a picky eater, however I have worked in a variety of kitchens for many years, and I know how to spot quality and made-from-scratch vs prepackaged and boxed junk.  \n\n\nThat being said, my main issue with JP's has been the hit-and-miss service. Many times I've had fantastic service, but several, including my first time there, it has been pretty flaky, and this is largely due to the lack of experience of some of the staff, so I have not raised much of a fuss about it.  \n\n\nWhen it comes to pricing, the overhead to be in the student union must be pretty insane. The bottom line, with JP's is that their food tends to be pretty simple, made from scratch, which isn't a bad formula to me.",

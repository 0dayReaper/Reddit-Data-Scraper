    "postText": "I know for a fact that K-State has gotten much friendlier over the years, but I\u2019m still held up on a few things. Probably my first concern is housing. I\u2019ve toured KU and they seem to offer a variety of gender-diverse housing options. The closest thing that I know exists at K-State is that Wefald has a few coed wings, but I don\u2019t think KSU offers such a living arrangement like KU does. \n\nSecondly, I know in terms of population, KSU tends to be a more republican school than in Lawerence, so if anyone has some pointers or insights into that, it would be wonderful to hear.\n\nThere are parts of KSU that appeal to me, primarily the compact campus, but I\u2019m worried about the social environment there. Thanks.",

There's same-sex couples holding hands in public, people put pride flags on their houses and apartment windows. Again, this is my straight, cis perspective, but I don't think people would be doing those things if they didn't feel safe.\n\n\n&gt;KSU tends to be a more republican school than in Lawerence\n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind here is that Lawrence is very liberal not just by Kansas standards, but by national standards. That doesn't mean that KSU is \"more Republican\". Only in comparison to one of the most liberal campuses in the country. It's still an average college town and those ALWAYS skew left, even in extremely rural places. You could probably go to a college town in a place even more rural than Kansas like Wyoming or Alaska and you'd still be in the same town, basically. To some extent, all college towns are the same.\n\nAlso, notice that according to the surveys I linked at the beginning of this comment, we're actually ranked higher than KU at least in regards to campus resources for LGBT folks.\n\nI would suggest reaching out to K-State's LGBT center  for more information.\n\nhttps://www.k-state.edu/lgbt/",

My friends, sister, and boyfriend went to KU, and it seems like it's more my style because I'm a liberal. KSU has lots of boots and big belt buckles and rednecks, and IMO, this affects your outlook on college, so choose wisley, I think no matter your lifestyle, you will find your people when you decide your major. \n\nI lived in sorority for a couple years and no one ever saw me naked, so if that's the only hang up with being trans, you should find a group of people to hang out with.",

Not so many in engineering at the time but I\u2019m noticing more young queer engineers entering the workforce where I work. Good luck in your schooling and career!",

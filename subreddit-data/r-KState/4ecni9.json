            "comment": "Actual vegan here! \n\nPretty much everywhere has something decent or reasonable. Pita Pit has amazing felafel wraps, Tasty China House (and the several other Chinese and other Asian style places) have TONS of options, there's an amazing Indian restaurant called Dancing Ganesha where all but 2 (out of 8 or 9 items) on their buffet are vegan. Really, every restaurant I've been to has had something or something really easy to get veganized. El Tapatio is one of my favorite places... amazing mexican food and many menu items that are literally just a \"no queso or sour cream, please\" away from vegan excellence. Even Dominos has happily cooperated in helping me veganize a pasta dish for delivery. \n\nThe only really tricky one is Buffalo Wild Wings where I think only the salad's vegan owing to them using animal fat to fry the fries.\n\nThe HyVee here has more and better selection of vegan specialty food than I have seen even in KC where I'm from. Tofurkey Pepperoni Pizza, Veganaise Garlic Aeoli, Field Roast frankfurthers... things I didn't know existed are all there. We also have People's Grocery Co-op that stocks a lot of other vegan specialty products.\n\nThere's the ECM house on campus that has Real Food Fridays where every Friday they serve a made-from-scratch, locally-grown (when possible) vegan buffet for a suggested donation of $2. Because of this I've met about 4 other vegans.\n\n\nI honestly was worried coming way out here in the middle of nowhere but it's actually been fine. Feel free to PM me, especially if you end up moving here and best of luck to you! :)",

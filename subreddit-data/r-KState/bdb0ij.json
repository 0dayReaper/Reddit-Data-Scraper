    "postText": "This May, the National Strategic Sales Institute will be holding its annual benefit auction. This auction benefits the sales students and the NSSI sales program as it continues to grow. The event is May 10th and the night consists of live music, a live auction, silent auction, open bar, and catered meal. This is a great networking event as many businesses from Manhattan and all over are attending. This is also a chance to get to know the future sales graduates from this program and could potentially lead to your company's newest hires! Tickets are 35$ for one or 60$ for two. There are many ways you can donate, including; cash donations, purchasing tickets or a table at the event, donation of items to be included in the silent auction and purchase of a raffle ticket to win a KSU wrapped moped (the sales of these raffle tickets go to benefit the Coming Together for a Cure NonProfit). I have a quota of money that I need to raise so any attribution would be very helpful. PM me if you would like to hear more about the auction and we can set up a time for a phone call. I would love to hear back from anyone who is interested in helping grow the Sales program here at Kansas State or just looking for a night of fun, entertainment and networking. Thank you all for your time and for reading this post. GO WILDCATS!",

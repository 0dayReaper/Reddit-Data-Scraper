    "postText": "I'm a senior in High School committed to K-State next year, and I'm looking at dorms with my roommate. \n\nSpending a lot of money certainly isn't the goal, so the traditional double at Goodnow or Marlatt is the first thing we looked at.\n\nThe traditional private double at Wefald looks nicer and larger for a similar setup, though more expensive. \n\nWe also looked at the cluster suites at Putnam, which are a little less expensive than the private doubles for two. They also look like a bit of fun. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions/tips on where to live? Information on quality of dorms?\nWe're both pretty open to anything at this point.\n\nEdit: What are some complaints you have of any building you've lived in? ",

It's more of a community feel since it's a smaller dorm. You really get to know your dorm mates.",

I'm in goodnow this year and it's fine, traditional college room with everything you'd expect pretty much. Wefald comes with a microwave (atleast did this year), lots of outlets all over the room as opposed to one on each side of the room in goodnow traditional, individual room temperature controls but they seem broken half the time. The rooms are a lot bigger but it seems kind of cheaply made, they also have study rooms all over which is nice and a kitchen on each floor. I would go Wefald if you could, but would recommend Kramer complex if that's not possible.",

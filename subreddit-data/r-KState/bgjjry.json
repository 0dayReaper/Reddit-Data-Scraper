My career goal is to work in an undergraduate advising. Unfortunately, I was never able to get a job in community college/university, it's just really hard to get a job there. I currently work as a career specialist at a non profit organization where I am able to practice academic as well as career advising to high school students. I've been at this job for 1.5 years. I realized that if I'm going to work in a college setting, I would need experience and a masters degree and that's why I applied to KSU. Surprisingly, the process was really easy. I only needed to submit a professional statement, no letters of rec, no GRE and I applied literally 3 weeks ago and got the acceptance letter. I am also applying to UC Riverside and Sam Houston State University and still waiting to hear from them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my question is, how was the academic advising program overall? and anyone from California has taken this program? Did this degree help prepare you for a career in academic advising? any advice and insights are highly appreciated, thank you!",

There was a woman in my cohort who did a concentration in athletics and works in athletic academic development who is from California (she went to Sac State), and now works for K-State Athletics. Also have someone who worked in housing the year below mine that was from San Diego/went to Nevada Reno for undergrad. \n\nThe academic advising program at Kansas State is incredible, and definitely under the radar. The best part is that NACADA, the national association of academic advisors is housed at Kansas State, and one of the main faculty of the student affairs program is the Executive Director of NACADA. I wish I would have done the Academic Advising certificate with my masters, because if I would have had that I would be in a better place to transition from Student Activities to Academic Advising (which I am still navigating).\n\nFeel free to PM me any questions or want to connect about K-State. I loved every second of the program.",

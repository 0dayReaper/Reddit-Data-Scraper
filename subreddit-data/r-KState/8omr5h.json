    "postText": "Within the last month I have decided to go to KSU, so am in need of housing come August. Im a 23y/o guy, but have little preference on who I live with. \n\nIm pretty down to earth, and can keep to myself or hang out with people. Part of my job has always been talking to everyone, so I get along with most everyone. Im pretty clean, and can abide by a chore schedule if thats how we decide to do things. \n\nI would like to keep total costs &lt;$500/month, ideally less. I would prefer laundry units in the unit/house. Not having to share a bathroom is also a plus, but not required. \n\nLet me know if you still need a roommate for august",

            "comment": "Hey! I am actually typing up a sublease ad for craiglist for August 1st. I am currently at the Gramercy by the K-State football stadium. I am in one of their very last two bedroom/two bathroom apartments! (Mine has washer and dryer in the apartment!) And you get your own bathroom attached to your bedroom! The leases are individual which means you don't have to worry about finding a roommate, they help that happen. The current market rate is $499, however that inlcudes ALL utilities and internet. Most of all of the apartments are filled up, except mine. My roommate is moving out July and I'm looking to do the same! I just need a sub-leaser to take over my rent so I can :) ",

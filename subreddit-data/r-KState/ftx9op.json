If you\u2019re just here for a semester it\u2019ll be a little bit tricky to try to experience Greek life since it\u2019s considered a lifelong commitment and there is a semester long \u201crushing\u201d period for most fraternities. It\u2019s a significant investment of time and money on behalf of the person rushing and the fraternity itself so it\u2019s not likely that you will be allowed to rush. \nThat being said last semester there was an exchange student from Australia who wanted to check us out and we invited him to a couple of our events and parties. He was really cool and we enjoyed having him around.",

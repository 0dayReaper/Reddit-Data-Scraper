            "comment": "Hmm, well, just so you know, getting off of Tuttle Creek Rd. On to Bluemont, there is a roundabout. I would suggest avoiding it entirely. If there are more than 3 people in town who don't know how it works, the whole thing gets backed up for a long time. I'd suggest following Tuttle Creek to Kimball, take a left, and then you'll end up right at the stadium! Enjoy the game!",

These can get you just about anywhere you'd need to go.\n\nAggieville: Moro St. between Manhattan Ave. and 11th St. is and will forever be one of the most unique college experiences in America. \n         Best places to eat: Coco Bolos, Taco Lucha, So Long Saloon, and Celtic Star. \n         All the bigger sports bars (Tanner's, Johnny Kaw's, Kite's, Tubby's) are all decent sports bars. \nPoyntz Ave. offers a bit more mild experience. Bourboun &amp; Baker, Tallgrass Tap House, Harry's, Four Olives, Della Voche, are all good places to eat. Honorable mentions, Powercat Sports Grill on Anderson Ave, Mr. K's on Vanesta dr.\n\nLate Night eats: Fuzzy's tacos, Pepperjax Grill, Varsity food truck, Cozy Inn Burgers, Pizza (AJ's, Jeff's, Pizza shuttle)\n\nSunday Morning Breakfast/Brunch: The Chef, Early Edition, Bob's Diner, Coco Bolos. \n\nWith these options, I hope you have an great time while you're in town.

Starting from the corner of College Rd and Clafflin going north on college there is: an apartment complex (one of the buildings burned down last week so idk if they'll be selling parking), a federal government building of some sort (parking in the circle drive in front is free, so is the lot behind it), a church whose youth group does it as a fundraiser and the youth budget the money to charities of their choice, and some houses that will charge you to park in their yard. If you choose any of those places, walk along the road south of the baseball stadium and go north after you pass it for the shortest route to the Bill.",

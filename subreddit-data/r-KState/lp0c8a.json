Nobody knows how many car accidents they could have prevented if they had just canceled class for a day.",

For example, I as an Architectural Engineer will never need to remember anything I learned in Chemistry or Engineering Physics II, and I hated them both. You still need to keep your GPA up, but I found it less stressful going through those classes knowing that it was only temporary stress that wouldn't affect me long-term.\n\nAlso, get in good with an advisor that you like (and other professors in ME). They have all sorts of professional connections, stories, and experiences that can help you figure out what to do with your career.\n\nTake classes with Dr. Wanklyn if he's still around, I had him for Thermodynamics. Tough but fair teacher, incredible personality, and actually cares about his students.\n\nJoin at least one club so that you have a bigger support structure while you're here, and a distraction from your classes if you need them.\n\nI hope this helps! Keep asking the big questions early and you'll go far :)",

Don\u2019t be afraid early on to change your mind, because once you get far in, it\u2019s not always the best idea. You\u2019ll have Wanklyn for ME101 and you can always talk to him honestly about your major and he will genuinely help you decide what\u2019s best for you. You should appreciate him while you have him because he\u2019s like a 2nd dad IMO. EP1 and ep2 are god-awful but make some friends in it and study together, especially for the tests.

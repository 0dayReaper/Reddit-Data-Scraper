Whoever posted the signs has just as much right to post them as someone advertising a pride parade or a campus ministry.  I just hate to see K-State go the direction of many other college campuses around the country where only the ideas of one side of the political spectrum are freely accepted and the others are suppressed.

A lot scarier than a couple of crazies spouting opinions that nobody is going to listen to.",

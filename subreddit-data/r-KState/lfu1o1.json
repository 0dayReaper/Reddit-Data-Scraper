    "postText": "So my roommate already has an arrest warrant because she didn't show up to her court hearing after the FIRST noise complaint she had back in May. The first noise complaint was called from our neighbor. \n\nFor the past month, she's been having a group of friends (5-10 people) over on Saturday nights, and they party and are really loud from 2AM to about 5AM. One guy actually tried getting into my locked bedroom three times while saying \"where's the covid girl?\" (I had covid a month ago). My boyfriend showed up carrying a concealed gun and stayed with me until they would leave, but we gave up at around 4AM and left to go to his place. It did make me laugh, because on our way out I accidently turned off the lights to the living room when I meant to turn off the porch lights. When it was dark, my boyfriend slammed the door, making the frame shudder. \n\nI've been pretty mad about since then because this particular roommate and I are not in good terms. She smokes inside, she steals my food, ruins my stuff, and makes my life overall miserable. \n\nSo here's my question. Can I call the Riley County Police non-emergency line to have a cop sent over to tell them to shut up like last time?",

When he put us all on a group chat discussing the first noise complaint, he said that it breaches contract and it made it so that he wouldn't let me sublet or get out of the contract (that's another story). How should I phrase this to him in a text? I keep going to him with everything she's done, and I feel like such a tattletale sometimes.",

You are both on the lease, so anything she does can also effect you. Set ground rules on when and who comes over. Since you have a BF, let her know that if she is planning on having a party to give you notice so you don't have to be there. And ffs, guns and drunk people don't mix. Even if your bf was sober, the worst thing you can do is introduce a weapon into the situation. If you felt like you were in enough danger that a firearm was the only recourse, you should have called the cops already.",

She has no respect for anyone and wants to party every night when I have to work early the next morning. Also, it's kinda hard to talk to her during the day, because she's sleeping off the alcohol from her all-nighter parties.\n\nIn defense of my boyfriend, he knew someone was trying to get into my room. He was trying to defend me against the guy who was trying to get into my bedroom.",

YOU voluntarily entered into a legal living arrangement with this person. YOU need to stand your ground, firmly and directly address the issue. YOU need to stop making excuses as to why you can't communicate with her. YOU need to generate support from your other roommates (assuming there are roommates) to resolve the issue. If YOU choose to involve the police or other outside forces, YOU will be the one who pays the consequences of an angry roommate.",

Bringing over multiple friends and possibly endangering people with Covid, even though you've already gone through it, is so selfish. When you don't feel safe in your own home to the point you need your bf to come stay with you with a weapon, something isn't right. I would look into discussing with your landlord the situation and trying to GET OUT, sublet, move on with your life. She obviously doesn't respect you or your things, and I wouldn't bet on her suddenly growing up and changing her ways.",

You cannot file a noise complaint on yourself, you are on the lease so you are just as responsible for the noise coming from the property as she is (even if you want no part of it). If you\u2019ve really exhausted all options you could talk to your landlord but getting the cops involved is pretty lame lmao",

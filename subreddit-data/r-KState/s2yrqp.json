            "comment": "I feel like we will become the next ISU of last year this season. Sure there is still a lot of games left, but the way we have been playing so far is pretty embarrassing. They had the lead in 3 of the 4 games at halftime. They really need to finish the game strong because they let the game go in the second half. I don't care if they had only 8 scholarship players, they need to play to win and they didn't do so in those 2nd halfs in the past 4-5 games. If they want a chance to go to NIT or March Madness, then they need to really step it up and win games without choking the leads. Much improvement needed and I think Bruce Weber needs to go after this season as well. He has lead the basketball team to very horrible seasons the past 3 years after they made it to the Elite Eight in 2018 in March Madness. Shocking.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, my car was broken into on K-State property the night between 6/2 and 6/3. I've filled a report with K-State Police. If anyone sees a Sony Vaio laptop, a Sony A6000 camera with two lens, a Seiko Presage (brown dial) watch, Orient Bambino (blue dial) watch, and a wood watch winder box appear on any market place, let me know or K-State Police know as it's likely those are stolen property. Any help is appreciated.",

Edit: this sounds sarcastic rereading it, and that is very unintentional. The thanks is meant for the keeping your eyes out. Sorry been a long few days and just mentally and physically exhausted.",

I\u2019ve had to learn the hard way myself not to leave anything remotely valuable in sight when I\u2019m not in my car. A new driver side window someone broke over a vape taught me that lesson. Now I won\u2019t leave anything.",

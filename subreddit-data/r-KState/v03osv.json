    "postText": "Hi all, I am a rising junior that was in Wefald my freshman year, then was in an apartment off campus with friends this last year. Those friends fell through for next year so I\u2019ll be at Goodnow. Any big differences from Wefald that I should know about? I know all the Kramer dorms have been renovated recently but I\u2019m unclear on the details.",

            "comment": "Last I heard, their last renovation went really well. All of the rooms are now carpeted and the lobby spaces are really cleaned up, especially in comparison to marlatt. There is a lot more sound privacy than what you would've had in wefald since the walls are cement blocks rather than drywall. I'm pretty sure that there's also a gym in the basement like there is in marlatt, something that isn't in wefald.",

The dorms there are just like the rest of the dorms on campus (minus wefald). Still not a bad place to live, its all about the effort you put into making your space comfortable.  If you're not in a \"suite\" then you'll have the (ugly) tile floor. A nice big rug will make it feel much more homey.",

In my experience, it was a much closer knit community and we had a lot of people who came from wefald to hang out with us. The RAs in Goodnow tend to continue to live in Goodnow since they enjoy it so the community feeling tends to continue! Some of the floors/hallways were renovated in 2019!",

Let's call her \"Kerushii Hessuketto.\" After I found out that she worked at Digital Shelf, when I got there to check out a few films, the owner was there and said he \"couldn't give out\" when \"Kerushii\" would be working next.\n\nWhat were his assumptions?",

You asking him for her schedule tells him that you can't ask her yourself which *could* mean that she doesn't want you to know her schedule.  He'll almost certainly have mentioned the interaction to her in case she has a problem with a stalker or something that he doesn't know about. ",

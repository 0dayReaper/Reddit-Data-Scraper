For all we know it may have been completely made up to try and bring attention to himself.  Just going off the article I feel that is what the \"victim\" intended given that it says the officer marked down race as white and he felt the need to say that we was black. He must have been fairly light skinned and with him being 50/50 (according to the article) that means the officer marking down white was just as true and him marking down black.  Without evidence of what actually happened we will never know. But the article talks about the incident without giving it much doubt which then creates more of a divide between students and the police department. If a student then is not able to feel comfortable contacting the police they may feel backed in a corner if a serious situation arises. Which can have deadly results. \n\nAnd I feel that they were purposefully trying to create some type of animosity between students and at least this officer. Which is why they made the point of making clear the middle initial of the officer compared to the individual on staff at the paper. \n",

At least I haven't seen any proof for it.  It's been about 5 years since I was on campus full time, and now I'm just back for football games. But I never felt any type of real animosity or hatred between anyone really on campus.  Everyone I saw was always friendly and the only time I saw people upset at one another was confrontations between drivers and walkers on campus. Maybe things have changed but I find it hard to believe that anyone really feels scared unless it's do to an individual(like personal beef or ex partner)that they have a past with.  Especially someone saying they feel afraid being black on campus when they are light skinned enough to be marked as white by a law enforcement officer.  ",

First, there was the summer noose. Then, the sukkah... that was destroyed by the wind... then the Union graffiti that somehow hasn\u2019t been solved despite tons of video cameras in the area... then the Snapchat thing that wasn\u2019t aimed at anyone... now this guy who happens to be heavily involved in protesting previous incidents and there is zero evidence this actually happened. Call me stupid, but if a cop interviewed me and was a total dick then said he had to come back and interview me a second time, I\u2019d have my iPhone recording audio at least... \n\nAlso, I looked at the kid\u2019s Facebook. No one would ever confuse him for white. The story doesn\u2019t make sense.",

The discussion did not happen solely between two people, but three and two of the three people are in agreement with what occurred. The question then becomes, why do you so readily discount their recollection of what happened? Why doesn\u2019t their story carry weight?\n\n",

The quote was:\n\n\u201cJonathan Peuchen, speaker of the student senate and senior in mechanical engineering, was present with Kelly for the follow-up phone call from Schrag. Peuchen said Kelly\u2019s fear of harassment was \u201crational\u201d and that Kelly had spent the night of Oct. 19 in the Student Governing Association office.\u201d\n\nUnless I missed something in the story, Peuchen *does not* confirm the story but simply says Kelly\u2019s fear of harassment is rational. It\u2019s an oddly worded paragraph that a couple questions and/or an additional story could clear up:\n\n1- did Peuchen hear the second interview?\n2- what did the officer say during the second interview?\n3 - do you agree with Kelly\u2019s story as reported in the email?\n\nIt\u2019s weird that the reporter either did not ask those questions or Peuchen didn\u2019t offer a more substantive quote. Hopefully additional info will be forthcoming but... after Sukkahgate 2k17 and Carhategasm 2k17, I think critical thinking can go a long way.",

Further, reading the text, I can\u2019t help but think everything this officer said and did seems straight out of the imagined stereotypical racist cop playbook. So a cop responds to take a report from someone who has been in the media about racial issues and chooses that time to discuss all these issues? Seems sort of... unlikely? Lastly, why is it in these articles that every single person the writer interviews confirms the writer\u2019s narrative. The narrative is that minorities feel unsafe at KSU... every person they interview confirms that. Could it be that the writer only interviews people who feel that way because I have a funny feeling that there are plenty of members of minority groups at KSU who do not feel unsafe. Just a guess.",

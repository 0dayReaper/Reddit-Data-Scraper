    "postText": "Hi y'all!\n\nI'm a graduate researcher at Clemson University, and I'm studying how undergraduate students in a technical major (Computer Science, Information Technology, Computer Engineering, etc.) use Discord.\n\nMy survey should only take \\~10-15 minutes to complete and there's an optional (20 minute or less) interview opportunity as well. This study is approved by the Clemson IRB.\n\nLink: [https://clemson.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_2seLcdyyZ4ONAhM](https://clemson.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2seLcdyyZ4ONAhM)\n\nI greatly appreciate y'all taking time out of your day to complete my survey! Your responses will help me move forward on my dissertation. :)\n\nFeel free to comment or DM me with any questions you may have!",

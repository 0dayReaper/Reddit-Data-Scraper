    "postText": "Hello! I am in search of a relet for my apartment this coming Spring semester through July 31st, 2020. I will be graduating this December so it will be available January 1st, 2020. I live at the Gramercy apartments located at 2215 College Ave. Manhattan, KS 66502. I have already lived at the Gramercy for over a year and it's a very comfortable place to live with lots of amenities. My current rate is $399 a month, which covers all utilities (trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable, internet, and a $30 allotted amount/month for water) except for electricity and the amount of water over the $30. On average, I usually pay around $30 a month for electricity. Also, the apartments are fully furnished! Another great thing about reletting is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in. If you choose to be my relet, you can live in any open apartment in the complex if your preferences don't match up with the girls I live with now.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me at 361-522-1789 or [leahp33@ksu.edu](mailto:leahp33@ksu.edu). If you would like to set up a tour or have any additional questions you can contact a Leasing Professional at 785-539-0500.",

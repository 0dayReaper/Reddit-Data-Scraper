    "postText": "I want to go K State and major in animal science, but I worry my left wing values will be a major conflict. Is this a serious concern? I know generally that agriculture is conservative, but does that apply to agricultural sciences as well? And if so, what does that look like? Is it typical American conservatism, or is it different?",

            "comment": "The college of Ag, animal science included, is predominantly conservative. You classmates and even your instructors will lean right. You won\u2019t get any backlash for your ideology as long as you\u2019re respectful and open minded. \n\nA lot of people here are saying Manhattan is open and welcoming, and they are correct. The college of Ag is a different area and it can be uncomfortable at first if you\u2019re not used to it. Now, there are plenty of left leaning people in the major, so you won\u2019t feel so alone. But, expect to hear a lot of right wing bias which might include a group of classmates talking down on the Democratic Party and things you genuinely enjoy or believe in. \n\nOverall, you\u2019ll be ok no one is going to hurt you or go after you. Be prepared though, you\u2019ll be definitely be in the minority in terms of politics. Hope that helps, PM me if you want to talk more , I graduated in ASI and am always here to help",

            "comment": "Manhattan in general is a very welcoming town, and its values have moved steadily to the left over the past decade.  We voted for Biden, we voted No, are on lists of top LGBTQ campuses in the nation, and we don't have any assholes driving around with Trump flags on their trucks or protesting at elections offices.\nKSU is also a pretty progressive campus.  Even if you have differing values, no one's going to want to start a fight about it.  Esp as our Ag and Vet programs are some of the best, what you'll find there are the incredibly kind and intelligent people who are keeping it successful.\nIf your worry is of the \"typical American conservatism,\" (which as a hard leftist I completely understand) Manhattan is a great safe haven from that.  There are probably some MAGA assholes somewhere in town, but you don't have to find them if you don't want to.  It's the best city in KS.  Don't be worried about applying at K-State, I don't think you have anything to worry about.",

During the election there were freaks driving around in a little caravan, one of them even had an animatronic Trump in the bed of their pickup. There's also a guy with a bunch of Q anon imagery and decals all over his truck that I've seen around town. It may not be as much of a thing on campus, but those people exist in Manhattan.",

Now I used to be in the Animal Science department before I switched majors (switched just due to interests not because I disliked the program) and almost everyone was nice. A lot of pre vet people in the program who are usually a little more liberal leaning than general Ag. You will encounter a few rotten apples in the program of closed minded individuals just like you will anywhere in Kansas but majority of people just mind their own business and keep to themselves. Plus you will meet and make friends with people outside your major. There is however one professor in the program who is super conservative and actively makes fun and mocks people who are liberal (they have gotten in trouble multiple times so they might not do it as much as when I had in 7 years ago) who atleast 7 years ago used to teach a couple classes. I mean always talking about how Biden stole the election and posting Qanon stuff etc. I don't want to dox him though so if you want to know who they are just dm me and I can let you know so you have a heads up.",

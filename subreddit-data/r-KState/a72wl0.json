I'm not sure why they still send out the activities booklet to prospective students since they're such a waste. Sure like to brag about your student activities but don't like to support them, huh Pat?",

I believe he said something about not bringing any money into the university and instead costing it a lot. I think my sister received one of those activities booklets as a high schooler and I sat there looking at it on the counter wondering how much input he had in sending those out. Pretty sure he had a foreword in it too.",

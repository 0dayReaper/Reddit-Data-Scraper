You could stop by anybody\u2019s tent/camper and introduce yourself and they\u2019d be more than happy to sport you some snacks or a beer. (sometimes you can paypal them like a tip) You can essentially just tailgate hop and have a great time doing it!",

The college scene is out past the pavement on the east side (refereed to as the dirt lot) might be a fun experience for a walk through if your into that kind of scene lol if not the pavement lots are full of welcoming people!",

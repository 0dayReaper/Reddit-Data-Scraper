If you've never been to the Manhattan river trails, those are fun, as are the trails behind sunset cemetery. Pott 2 fishing lake is pretty cool too. \n\nHonestly, if you drive in any one direction and take random back roads, you're bound to find something interesting. \n\n[This is north east of Tuttle. ](https://i.reddituploads.com/0b16e537a6c244579d915e1c3840f7f6?fit=max&amp;h=1536&amp;w=1536&amp;s=aa245635fb3154e131f1d0007fd8b7e0) ",

I heard both marlatt and goodenow have been redone a little since I lived there a couple years ago, could be wrong. Marlatt was nicer than goodenow in my experience, but not by much. Wefald is nice.",

I liked the Van Zile complex because it's closer to the liberal arts side of campus and doesn't feel super dorm-y. The buildings are pretty and the first floor of Putnam has really tall ceilings, making it feel more spacious.",

Last I knew, wefald was more expensive though, and you need to be in the honors program to live in the honors house. Honors program was pretty easy for me to get into and you don't even have maintain the gpa average to stay there. You'll go on \"probation\" in the program after the first semesger and get a 1 semester grace period. Don't even take honors classes if you don't want to finish the program.",

The buildings are really old and honestly pretty cool looking, the actual buildings have less people  but they are much more tight knit of a community. I remember when I stayed in Putnam my freshman year \\(2 years ago\\) they had big community events \\(official and unofficial\\) pretty much every weekend to every other weekend. Knowing everyone on my floor was great and the university has a tendency to put a lot of really great student leaders in charge there.",

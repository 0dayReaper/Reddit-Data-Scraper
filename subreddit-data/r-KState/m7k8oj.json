    "postText": "I am a freshman majoring in computer science here at Kstate. I'll admit that I am currently getting my butt kicked by CIS 200 and it's taking a toll on me mentally. I really enjoyed the class in the beginning because I was understanding the material and we were moving at a slow but still progressive pace. I'm considering dropping 200 given that my grade isn't the best and am considering taking CIS 111 to build a stronger base before retaking CIS 200. I've also considered switching my major entirely to something like MIS. I've also considered architecture because I took a ton of CAD and Architecture classes in high school. Any advice that you can give me on how to go about moving forward?",

I'd be happy to chat with you, help you navigate the various options out there and find the right fit, regardless of what that is. Beyond MIS, you might consider the CS certificate or new Integrated Computer Science (ICS) program if you are still interested in programming, but there are lots of other majors that could fit your interests too. I'll DM you to try and make a connection.",

When you get into CIS 300, you\u2019re pretty much expected to be fluent with the basics of programming so they can teach as much new material as possible. I love the core programming classes, I\u2019ve learned a ton, but they can get difficult. It just takes some dedication and time to get through the work.",

I want to make sure that CIS 111 is really going to help me because last semester I switched from calc 1 to pre calc and pre calc was kind of a joke so I just focused on calc concepts and came into this semester much more prepared.",

But I remember the professor was frequently mentioning that you could switch from 200 to 111, so maybe it would be worth it. I\u2019m not sure if it covers OO programming. I guess it depends on what you\u2019re struggling with.",

After that, it gets harder. Most majors are like that. That's why you should pick your new major based on what it's going to be towards the end, not the exciting fun stuff at the beginning.",

I was enjoying the basics but struggled early on in CIS 200. But, somewhere around the middle of the semester, it started clicking for me. I just started \"getting it\". I think it's because I really started focusing on understanding the coding exercise assignments (I can't remember what the website was called, but we were required to complete a certain amount of the exercises). Do ALL of them. But don't just do them to do them. Make sure you understand why they work - it will help immensely going forward.  \n\n\nThat is, of course, if you want to stick with CS. I know quite a few people that started in CS, then moved to MIS, and were happy with the change.",

FWIW, just judging from what the course catalog says, 111 *might* spend a lot of time covering stuff you already know.\n\nI would **highly** recommend you take up Russ Feldhausen's offer to chat. He's one of the best CS teachers I had and is really easy to talk to. He'd definitely know more about 111 than I would.",

So will everywhere else but you're more likely to find a spot and they're more \"typical\" bars. \n\nI'd walk up and down the street once or twice and then stop in wherever looks good to you.",

Kat House is also gone and is now Tate's, which is pretty popular (at least with the younger crowd). \n\nVarneys (obvs isn't a bar) is no longer around for the first time in 120 years but the marquee remains.\n\nThe Tallgrass Taphouse opened over in downtown. It's hard to get into on gamedays but they've got some beers you won't be able to find anywhere else. Could be worth a reservation since you're in town.\n\nHope you have a fun time!",

If you're a member of the younger crowd, or a wilder member of the older crowd, check out the grass lot tailgate area east of the stadium in front of the recreation complex.  It's where the good party is at.  Feel free to walk around with beer, just have it in a koozie or in a solo cup.  You can walk with the case, just not the open beer, I know, it's dumb, we're all well aware.  Welcome to Kansas State!  ",

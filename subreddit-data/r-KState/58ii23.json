I didn't have any trouble with games or streaming when I was on dorm wifi, but some of my friends there have. Ethernet shouldn't give you any problems unless there's an outage for some reason.",

Outside the dorms, the wifi is pretty reliable, although you may need to switch between the KSU Housing / KSU Wireless networks (both available campus-wide) if bandwidth on the other happens to be filling up.\n\nOff-campus, Cox is okay given that Manhattan is pretty small; you'll likely get 30-50 Mbps down / 5ish Mbps up on their standard plan, which is more than enough for the vast majority of people. My experience with AT+T is that they're much slower, much more expensive, and much more annoying to deal with.",

If you can, try to get a room near the WAPs because it can hit 50 Mbps on off-peak hours, there's 2 per so go for a room near the middle of the hall. I unfortunately live in the end of the hall and don't even get wifi reception.",

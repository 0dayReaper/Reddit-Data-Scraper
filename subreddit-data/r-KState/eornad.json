    "postText": "Pretty much as the title says. I\u2019m a CompSci junior who switched from Computer Engineering and had more math and science than I needed. I transferred in after taking Calc 1-3, DiffEq, and Discrete Math and have since also taken Matrix Theory. I\u2019m currently sitting at 12 hours this semester but I really want to finish off what I need for my minor. I know virtually nothing about any of these classes except that I\u2019ve had one professor tell me that Advanced Calculus is very difficult (because he teaches it). I wanted to know firsthand from any students which of the following math classes is the most interesting. \n\nMy options now are Introduction to Algebraic Systems (511) and Foundations of Analysis (520). I really enjoyed Calc 1 and 3 but my favorite math class so far was definitely Differential Equations. What are 511 and 520 like respectively?",

            "comment": "I'm a math major here at K-State and both of these classes have their harder alternatives that you could also look at to compare. 511 is similar to 512, both courses will go over groups, rings, and maybe fields and will be very proof-y and not at all similar to calculus classes. If anything, these classes will be most similar to your discrete math class but with more proofs. To get a good idea of this material, maybe check out Socratica's group theory videos. \n\n520 is similar to 633, both classes will cover the material from Calc 1-3 but in much more detail and your exercises will be in proofs of calculus theorems and not so much your standard evaluation of integrals or derivatives. \n\nI would say 511 is easier, but you may prefer 520 based off of your preference for calculus topics.",

            "comment": "CompSci and Math dual major here. 520 is much more calculus focused but in a very proof heavy way. It is not very high level in the calculus aspect, the challenge comes from the proof part. It is a very difficult class and I consider myself good at math. \n\n511 is a much easier course but is also proof focused. It has no real connection to calculus however but it will be a much easier choice if you don't have much experience with proofs. It was also one of my favorite math classes I have taken.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't take 520. I managed to complete it with a B, but I can't say I really grasped many of the concepts. My professor, Marianne Korten, was also not the best. She really moved the material quickly, and I had to spend a lot of time learning the concepts outside of class.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck.",

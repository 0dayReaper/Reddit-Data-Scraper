I lived in Goodnow and my floor was full of amazing and fun people.",

It was great for meeting people.\n\nFrom what I understand that opinion originated because the original use for Wefald was supposed to be upper classmen/grad students and maybe couples/solo dorms. Mostly people who have already found their friend group or are older and therefore wouldn't want to hang out with 18 year old freshman. \n\nAs I understand they had trouble finding enough people like that who wanted to live in the dorms and ended up having floors mixed between seniors and freshman. Causing a rift of \"a few people want to be friendly but everyone else just ignores us\"\n\nYou can pretty much always \"downgrade\" to a different building if you don't like it, provided they have the space, but I don't think it's been an issue in the past.",

People in Wefald were stuck up and kept to themselves for the most part, but there was a small group of people that would hang out together. \n\nThe only way I\u2019d recommend Wefald is if you\u2019re an engineering major and money isn\u2019t a big factor.",

It\u2019s hit or miss, as with every dorm. I will say that Wefald is a lot nicer than some of the other dorms if that\u2019s a factor for you. It\u2019s proximity to the engineering building is great if you\u2019re in that field as well.",

    "postText": "I know that the rent is usually $400 but I PROMISE the rent is $319 a month! I am trying to sublease my apartment in Manhattan at the Gramercy! The lease is for just a single bedroom but the apartment you will be staying in is a four bedroom two bathroom apartment. It comes fully furnished which means that it has a bed, closet, dresser,  and desk. Apartment comes with a washer and dry as well as a mostly furnished kitchen. Apartment complex has lots of fun features to it including a pool, basketball court, sand volleyball, and a tennis court. And if you like to hit the weights, they have a fully equip weight room for you to use plus its 24 hours!! Last but not least, it is VERY pet friendly! There are some fees that come along with the sub lease. But I will take care of them and I can also help with first months rent for you whenever the first month would be for you! Thank you very much for taking the time to read about this! Also, no gender specifics.\n\nIf you have any questions about the apartment please do let me know! We can talk anytime!\n\nJust email me at - [adam.hayse2@gmail.com](mailto:adam.hayse2@gmail.com) Or give me a text/call at - (620)779-2192",

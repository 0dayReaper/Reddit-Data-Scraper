Maybe it's [hours worked](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2015/mobile/time-spent-working-by-full-and-part-time-status-gender-and-location-in-2014.htm), [career](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/05/09/men-and-women-choose-careers-differently/) [choice](http://gap.hks.harvard.edu/gender-competitiveness-and-career-choices), [family priority's](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/01/women-more-than-men-adjust-their-careers-for-family-life/), or maybe women choose [safer jobs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/12/21/heres-your-gender-pay-gap-fatal-occupational-injuries/).\n\nEven after all of that let me lay out a scenario for you.  Say you own a business.  You are looking to hire a worker that will be the best fit. You have two applicants. One man and one woman. Both have equal education and experience. Both of them are in the mid 20s and married.  Given the statics are data available it would show for the same money the male would be the better choice given that statistically men work more hours, are more dedicated to their job, and due to biology will not need to be on leave for child care after birth. So given the law requiring both to be paid the same, and given that there is, statistically speaking, a greater return for hiring the male, the woman then is either not able to compete or your company will be worse off by having a lower return. \n\nJust like right now. Three weeks ago I had a child and my wife is currently home on maternity leave while I went back to work at the start of the next week and have been working overtime to stay caught up. \n\nIt is entirely possible that the entire world isn't sexist and that it's the choices people make that lead them to the result they have.

Notice how everyone talks about the gender disparity with CEOs, but no one mentions the numbers with oil yard workers, or trades workers who also make good money. There is just more work involved in often unclean conditions. \n\nA society that works toward equality over freedom will end with neither equality nor freedom. \n\nI just feel with all of the problems that the state faces it may not be wise to spend time and effort chasing a problem that doesn't really exist anymore. \n\nIn closing I would just say thanks for responding instead of just ignoring like so often happens. \n",

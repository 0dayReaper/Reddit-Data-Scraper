    "postText": "Hey guys, former student here (living in southeast KS now) and I'm looking to take the fianc\u00e9e to the game vs Central Arkansas this weekend. I was thinking it would be super cool to sit in the student section, so I was looking to see if anyone had a student pass they weren't using this weekend. I'd be willing to buy it from someone for the day, and I would be able to get it back to you that night after the game. If you're interested or need more information from me, comment or PM me on here. Thanks guys!",

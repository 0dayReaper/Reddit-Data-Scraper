He's a K-State alum and it's been a long time since he's been to a game or on campus. \n\nI wanted to post here to see if anyone had good leads on tickets outside of websites like stubhub or seatgeek. \n\nThank you in advance for any help you could provide!",

Not sure if you want to stay away from websites but Tickets for Less is a Kansas City based ticket company that I use for all of my sporting events. Their prices would still probably be about the same, maybe marginally cheaper than StubHub or seat geek. Good luck with your search, hopefully you can find a seat and join us for a great game!",

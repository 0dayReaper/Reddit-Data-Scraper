    "postText": "There are currently three of us staying here for the next lease. We're all mid-20s guys with engineering backgrounds and two of us are graduate students in Computer Science. Some of our shared interests include anime, gaming, cooking, and education. If you want to know more about us, ask away!\n\nRent is about $420/month each when split 5 ways; utilities are separate and total to about $80-100 each. Unclaimed bedrooms are not furnished and our lease does not allow pets. On the plus side, we have a 4-car driveway, an enclosed back yard with a porch, separate washer and dryer units, a fully equipped kitchen, and two spacious living rooms. Our front room even has a handmade bar with a minifridge!\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions you have about the property or the rest of us. You can visit for a tour if you'd like, but I can also provide pictures or a virtual tour due to the quarantine.\n\nEdit:  \n[Picture of the front](https://i.imgur.com/4Ij0wt7.jpg)  \n[Picture of the back](https://i.imgur.com/hLdULY1.jpg)  \n[Kitchen pic 1](https://i.imgur.com/7xpaH4o.jpg) and [pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/6s2uawB.jpg)",

We'd prefer new roommates to either be able to stay, pay rent, sublease, or find a replacement through to the end of the lease. We're flexible though, so if you want to work out something specific just send me a private message.\n\nCongrats on graduating and good luck on your job search!",

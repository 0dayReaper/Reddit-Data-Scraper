There were some slight restrictions to get in, but they were VERYY lax. \n\nsomething like a 18 on the ACT, (which was optional). Or a +3.25 GPA in highschool (if i remember correctly.)\n\ni had a 21 on my ACT when i applied and they immediately accepted me. Then i retook my ACT and actually tried and got a 28, and they sent me a congratulations letter lmao. \n\nhighly, and i mean HIGHLY reccommend going to school there. It was five of the best years of my life. &lt;3",

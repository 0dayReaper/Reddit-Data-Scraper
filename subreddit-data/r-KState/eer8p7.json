    "postText": "Hey guys.\n\nI'm a junior at Pitt, and I was just offered a summer internship in Junction City.  If I end up accepting the offer, I would be living in Manhattan.  I'm wondering what Manhattan is like during the summer, and I figured this would be the place to ask.\n\nHow many students stay on campus during the summer?  Does it turn into a total ghost town, or are there still going to be lots of people around?  What's the night life like?  Is there much to do?\n\nI know nothing about the town aside from that KSU is there.  I'd obviously prefer to spend my summer in a place where there will be people my age who I can hang out with.\n\nAny help is appreciated.  Also, if you're gonna be in town this summer, feel free to DM me.  I'm a 21 year old guy, industrial engineering major, I like sports and beer, and I play ultinate frisbee.\n\nThanks!",

There\u2019s also more outdoor activities than you\u2019d imagine \u2014 hiking in the Konza prairie, river rafting, water skiiing, swimming... and the bars are open.  Ha.",

Mainly because other IE interns they grabbed from K-State will most likely be staying in Manhattan and would be great people to hang out with. \nI\u2019m an IE at K-State and didn\u2019t stay in town last summer, but I came back every other weekend and it was still a fun place to be. Yeah, the townies kind of take back their town during the summer, but Aggieville (our bar district) is still a fun place on the weekends and even some week nights! \nI also had a decent amount of friends and other people I knew from classes and such stay in town, so I always had someone to hangout with when I came back up. \nWould recommend Manhattan over Junction City.",

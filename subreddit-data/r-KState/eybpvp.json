Students can go support their K-State Family, classes aren't canceled, professors can still teach, and nobody gets reprimanded for skipping class on their grades. Badda bing badda bang.\n\nThoughts?",

It's great, I get it, everybody's excited and wants to go to the parade, but in reality, sports championships don't matter.  \n\nNothing changed when SKC won MLS Cup.  I was in the stadium for it.  It was awesome for about 24 hours and then you have to go back to your regular life.  Kids still need dinner, the bills still have to be paid.\n\nNothing has changed about my life because the Royals won the World Series.  Nothing is going to change because the Chiefs won the Super Bowl.\n\nCall me an old-fart, asshole, slave-driver, whatever, I don't care.  I just don't get the need to cancel school/work for a victory parade.  If you want to go, you have to decide if it's worth it to you to miss class/work.  Life is about choices and balance.  A big part of growing up is learning to make those choices yourself and deciding what's more important to you.  If it's the parade, more power to you.  Just don't expect everyone to accommodate you for everything.",

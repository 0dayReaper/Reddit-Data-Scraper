Maybe we can form a small group and play pub matches together.\n\nI came across a K-state esports webpage (LOL , Rocket league etc.) but found it to have not been updated for 2-3 years. So it didn't help in this matter.",

If there is enough interest overall there could be a team for that, but if you are just looking for people to play DOTA with you can always just ask if someone wants to play. I know for a fact that a few people regularly play it in there",

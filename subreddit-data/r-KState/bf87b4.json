Including utilities and pet rent I pay around $900 a month. Living with a roommate or two easily halves the cost. I'm a graduate student and in my late 20s so at this point I'd rather live by myself despite the price.",

His rent, excluding utilities, was about $600/month. I'd consider that very cheap. Studios in KC usually start at $800 and only go up once you go 1BR.",

It doesn\u2019t sound like it awards any money, but if you are an out of state student it would definitely help. I can\u2019t find any info on K-State\u2019s website, only third party scholarship websites.\nK-State just has one big scholarship application.  If you fill that out, they will pair you with any scholarship you qualify for. ",

I love Manhattan but it would be incredibly annoying to have to transition to online courses mid semester and have go back home. Aggieville is already a shitshow with social distancing so I can't see K-State staying open too much longer. \n\nIt's up to you on how much you like/dislike your current situation but getting your prerequisites completely finished up at Bultler would save you a good chunk of money. My Junior year was probably my most memorable because I could finally go to the bars and if i could do college over I would've definitely done my first two at a CC. \n\nI would just go online to K-State's website and apply, then after you're accepted you can meet/email with an advisor to discuss credit transfers and potential majors.",

They will be more than willing to walk you through the entire process and get you completely set up.  The admissions office can be helpful as well but I worked with my college's advising department before I went back after dropping out a few years before and it was entirely painless.",

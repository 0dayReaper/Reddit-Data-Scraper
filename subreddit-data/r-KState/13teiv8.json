    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am looking for a roommate for my gramercy apartment. It is a 4 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment and the lease is under my name.\n\nCurrently I have my wife and I in two rooms and another person in another room so we have one room available. \n\nThe base rent 267.50 a month and the average utility cost comes out around 50 dollars a month. There is a package holding fee of around 5 dollars a month total. So average monthly costs should be around 322.50 dollars. \n\nDM me if your interested so we can talk and see if we are a good match.\n\nI hope everyone has a great memorial day weekend.",

    "postText": "Hey all, I was having problems setting up my Chromecast and decided to try looking here for anyone who may have some tips.\n\nI live in Marlatt and have been trying to set up my Chromecast for a couple of months now, but to no avail. According to this website (http://housing.k-state.edu/resources/resnet/) they say that Chromecasts will not work on the wifi. However, it also says Xbox One will not work, and my roommate and several friends all have that console in this building and it works fine for them (yes, multiplayer gaming, they use K-State Guest wifi). Furthermore, I can see other Chromecast devices on the wifi (I'm using K-State Guest since K-State Housing is garbage) but mine refuses to show up. Does anyone know if and how a Chromecast can be set up on the wifi here? Thank you very much, go cats!",

Even the ethernet adapter will not help it. My coworkers and I have spent many hours trying to get it working, but to no avail.\n\nOn a side note, I really suggest you don't use Guest. It is unencrypted and unsafe to do anything on it that is remotely important. Someone who is willing to do so could attempt malicious attacks on anyone using that network. Housing using the same infrastructure but is set up in a much more secure fashion, so please use that. I believe Marlatt had new APs installed over the summer so you should have a pretty stable connection any time of day. Really the on only times you should have issues is when the whole network is struggling, your buildings bandwidth is capped, or you're having a hardware issue. Call Resnet in any of those cases. ",

Chrome cast almost always DO NOT work on K-State campus networks, the network simply doesn't allow it/ won't work.  Roku's and such work but anything that requires casting to work will not.",

I worked a lot of shifts for people so I would be making about $250-300 bi-weekly. Often times, the pay is $150-175 every two weeks. Every semester you work as a CA gets you $0.15 extra to your pay rate. I loved the job a lot because the hours are flexible and the Community Coordinators (The ones that run a particular dorm building) are really nice about it.",

The main downside to working there is that you are required to have one shift scheduled every other weekend. (Which you can trade if you find someone willing to take it) You're limited to 30 hours per week but not many people besides supervisor work that many hours. It's very easy to pick up additional shifts if you feel like you need more than you are originally scheduled for since people are always looking to drop shifts.",

If you get a good end of semester performance review you can get a slight pay increase if you work the next semester.\nAnother benefit is that after you complete your duties, you can do homework or mess around on your phone.\nThere are locations at each dorm complex, so you wouldn't have to travel far if you live on campus.",

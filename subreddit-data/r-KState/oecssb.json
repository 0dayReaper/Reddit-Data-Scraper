    "postText": "I\u2019m going to be a freshman at K-State this year and I was just wondering how Wefald hall is set up as far as co-Ed dorms go?\n\nSpecifically I\u2019m more concerned about the bathrooms, like are they co-Ed as well? Does each wing have their own gender bathroom? How does it work?\n\nAlso how are the floors set up? Are some floors co-Ed while some are girls/guys only?",

            "comment": "In Wefald each floor has three wings: Men, Women, and Co-Ed. The wings all have their own bathroom. With Wefald bathrooms there are like 5 smaller rooms with showers and toilets that all lock so they\u2019re private. There\u2019s a shared community sink area right outside those 5 smaller rooms.",

It\u2019s not like the other dorms where you just have a shower curtain. They are \u201cco-Ed\u201d but you go into a separate room to do your business. I always just brought my change of clothes in with me when I showered and changed before leaving the room.",

In Goodnow, the dorm was overall co-ed, but each wing was gendered. So bathrooms were functionally gendered, though it's not like they were actively policed. Each floor would have multiple wings, so you could have men and women on the same floor, but not in the same wing.",

But in suite wings, each suite has a private bathroom, so the wing itself will be co-ed. I don't know the details on Wefald though. Like I said, it was just dirt when I graduated.",

    "postText": "I'm a potential transfer student for the fall 2018 semester (already accepted). I'm coming from pretty far away, so I figure I should just live on campus for the first semester/year. I saw that the residence hall contract has a $30 fee, and I don't really want to pay that. Kansas State is among my top choices, but I have applied to 7 other places so I really haven't decided where I'm going. I probably won't decide where I'm headed until April, so should I pay the fee just in case, or will I still be able to get on campus housing in April?",

The housing contract process has been revamped recently, giving preference to folks who fill out the housing contract first moving to last. \n\n\nBasically, when housing contract opens for room selection next spring, you'll actually pick and choose the exact room they'll stay in the upcoming fall, moving in chronological order of when it was turned in. This means Wefald gets filled up very quickly!! So if you're gunning for Wefald, I'd fill it out now. But if you don't care as much, it's fine to wait until later. I lived in Moore and absolutely loved it. Would love to answer any other questions you have!",

You can get to MHK one-stop for about $225 from Newark, as an example.  It's about six or seven miles from the airport to campus.  There may be bus service or something, but I'm old so I have no idea.\n\nOtherwise, if you've got a car, I think a road trip is always fun.  Cars are handy too. ",

I've flown direct MHK to DFW a number of times and don't think I've ever seen that for less than ~$300. I've made like half a dozen round trips this year to the north east and MCI was much cheaper every time.",

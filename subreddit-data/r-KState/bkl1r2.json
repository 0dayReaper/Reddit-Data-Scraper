            "comment": "What are you majoring in? Are you a social person? How well off are you financially? Are you planning on joining a sorority? Do you enjoy hanging around boys or do you prefer hanging around with girls?\n\nHere\u2019s some info on each community with a little background on each. I lived in Moore 2 years, Wefald 1 year, had a girlfriend in Ford for 1 year, and a girlfriend in Boyd (all female) for 1 year.\n\nWefald:\n\nPros:\nGood area if you\u2019re an engineering major. Very close to engineering building, fairly close to the union. New everything is nice, Kramer dining is very cool. Rooms are wood floors, larger than average dorm room, large walk in closet with a lot of space. Both women and men so diverse relationships. Can possibly live in co-Ed hall which is a unique experience. Coffee shop and dining complex literally downstairs. \n\nCons: \nVery much fits the stereotypes of snarky rich kids. Community tends to be less social than the other halls (minus Ford, Boyd) so a lot of people keeping to themselves. Most expensive hall. Depending on your major can be inconvenient as it\u2019s clear across campus from Business, Bluemont, Hale, Dickens, etc. \n\nFord:\n\nPros:\nMost women here are freshmen in sororities so if you\u2019re in a sorority you\u2019ll be in good company. Largest female community hall by numbers. Very close to business, bluemont, Hale, etc. Derby dining complex is larger and runs more efficiently than Kramer. \n\nCons:\nIf you\u2019re not in a sorority and don\u2019t find men to be a distraction I\u2019d avoid Ford. The community tends to be reclusive (my girlfriend never even met her neighbors all year). Most people will be confined in their rooms, not in social common areas unlike other dorms. Far away from engineering, Calvin, Nichols, union, etc.\n\nAlternative but I\u2019ve heard great things about Marlett, Goodnow, and Haymaker. I\u2019m biased but if I could do it over again I\u2019d choose Moore hall every time. Largest hall (by numbers), one of the most active communities, and very close to things important to me. Not one of the newest halls, but that\u2019s okay for me. I\u2019d recommend going on tours and asking around to find out what works best for you, your needs, personality, etc. hope this helps and good luck! You\u2019ll love it there at KSU!",

I know a small handful of my neighbors, but some of that may be due to me being extremely busy and out of the dorm &gt;12 hours a day. It helps that I am a Mechanical Engineering major. If you are planning on going through recruitment for sororities then for sure go with Ford. You will all be here a week early and that is a great time to get to know people that you may be spending a lot of time with. Hope you love whatever decision you make!",

I\u2019m a bio major and it\u2019s SUPER close to the biology building. I live in a suite room, and it still ended up being less expensive than wefald. My floor has a pretty good community, though it is pretty small since goodnow is under renovations right now and some of the wings on each floor are closed (but the whole building will be open in the fall). My friends that live in ford are almost all sorority girls, so if you aren\u2019t going to join a sorority then you might feel left out.",

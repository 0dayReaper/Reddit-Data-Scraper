One bit of advice: get the earliest possible enrollment date you can get. Freshman-level classes do fill up, and while you'll surely be able to have a full schedule regardless, it's a lot better not to have to have a 7:30 am class if you don't have to.",

Also, know that K-State is a very well-rounded and respected university in a variety of programs so if you change your mind you have a lot of great options. Best of luck and go cats!",

Get ready to sprint across campus if your building is on the other side and only have 10 minutes. Do NOT enroll in early classes, you are more likely to skip them. Make friends in classes, they can help if you miss a class and need notes or will help with assignments.",

    "postText": "I know these posts can get pretty repetitive, but I really want to ensure that I end up with a comfortable living space for my first year. I apologize in advance if my thoughts seem a bit loose or unorganized.\n\n\nBasically, I just want my own room. It's my main priority. Knowing that, I've narrowed it down to a few options:\n\n\n* a \"traditional-private\" room in Wefald\n* a suite in Marlatt or Van Zille\n* a single room in Putnam, Moore, or Haymaker with communal bathrooms\n\n\nI'm not sure if Marlatt actually offers single room suites. The explore your options worksheet says it does, yet I can't find the floor plan for it.\n\n\nWefald seems like the nicest, albeit the most expensive option. I've heard someone describe the hall as a bit standoffish, though I don't really know how true that is.\n\n\nMy main concern is losing out on the experience of meeting new people in the dorms. That's why I probably won't end up in Van Zille, as it seems like a pretty isolated living space. However, I don't know if any of my other options are any better in that regard.\n\n\nIf anyone could share their thoughts are recommendations it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

            "comment": "I lived in Moore Hall for two years. \n\nThe solo room on the floor is a bit smaller than the traditional rooms, but it honestly looked cozy and I was a bit jealous of it. That being said, my first year the solo room guy completely kept to himself and never meshed with the floor. My second year, the solo room dude had no problem bonding with the floor. \n\nI'm a huge proponent of going the route of the \"traditional dorm experience\" so I would suggest to avoid any isolating situations such as suites. In my opinion, you seem to see fewer faces, meet fewer people. I'm not sure what Wefald is like.\n\nKeep your door open and be down to chill with your floor. Then, enjoy a solo room experience of your very own room and personal space. Perhaps it's the best of both worlds. ",

That being said, they just completed the bridges from Marlatt and Goodnow, so I would honestly suggest one of those. They have access to kramer at a much cheaper price",

            "comment": "Former RA from Moore - like others have said, the single rooms are very small.  Maybe 1/3-1/4 of a regular room.  Think the size of a prison cell (and I'm not exaggerating by much).  Also, they are mostly already spoken for by the returning residents so getting one as a first year resident will be a slim chance (unless they've changed it up since I was there).  They may hold one or two back for new residents.  Fun fact, the single room on Moore 5 is (or at least was) a photo lab that you could develop your own pictures in (if you had your own chemicals).\n\nI've seen residents be very outgoing in the single rooms, but I've also seen the shut-in types as well.  You'll still have the floor lobbies to hang out in if you want so you'll still have lots of social opportunities.\n\nI don't know about singles in Kramer Complex (Goodnow/Marlatt) or Strong (Putnam/Van Zile/Boyd).  Wefald wasn't even there yet when I was there.\n\nUltimately, you'll get what you put into it.  If you make an effort into being social, then you'll be fine in a single.",

The rooms are super narrow, but you get 2 or 3 times the built in storage of a standard room, which makes them feel even narrower. I personally would have been very claustrophobic trying to sleep in one of them.\n\n(FYI, I remember trying to use that darkroom in Moore. I don't think it had been cleaned in years, the equipment was kind of janky, and it's a PITA to have to go down to the front desk to check out the key and turn it back in. I also remember having a heck of a time finding the chemicals, because they weren't easy to find locally and the post office doesn't like to ship at least one of them. Granted, this was all like 15 years ago...damn I feel old now.)",

            "comment": "It obviously varies from person to person but I cannot recommend a traditional two-person room enough.  The floor I lived on in Marlatt had two hallways of normal two-person rooms and one hallway of suites.  The people who lived in the suites were virtual unknowns to most of the rest of us, they rarely came out and rarely socialized.  The other two hallways were constantly in and out of each others rooms.  I met some of my best friends doing exactly that.  The privacy of a suite can be appealing but you can get yourself your own room after a year or two in the dorms...a year of a roommate is worth it to make friends.\n\nEither way a few things you definitely want to do...\n\n1. Keep your door open as much as you possibly can.  The people who enjoy their time in the dorms the most are the people who keep their doors open.  The physical distance you create by shutting that 1.5\" is nothing compared to the psychological distance you create.\n1.   Treat your room as your social or chill out space...don't use it as a study space, at least not for the first semester or so.  Find yourself a place where you can separate \"work\" from \"play\" like the dorm common area or Hale Library.  This has the added benefit of being a comfortable place for other people to join you to study...jamming 3, 4, 5 people into a dorm room is bad enough, and nobody is truly comfortable studying in someone else's bedroom.\n1. Participate in dorm events.  Intramurels are great for this, even if you're not a sports type.  You can sign up to play or just ride along to cheer on your floormates.  They're free, they're easy, and you're making yourself available to others.\n1. Spend the first week just wandering the halls, especially on your floor.  Drop by the rooms where people have left their doors open.  Ask about their interests, whatever they're doing.  I met a couple of my great friends by just dropping in and listening to one of them jam on his guitar for an hour.",

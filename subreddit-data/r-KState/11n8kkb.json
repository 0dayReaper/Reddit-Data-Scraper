I\u2019m super excited to explore town &amp; I was wondering what some of the must-see things on &amp; around campus are. Any favorite restaurants, parks, buildings, nooks, or study spots within reasonable walking distance.\nThanks!",

Then if you don\u2019t mind a 15-30 minute walk downtown Manhattan is wicked cool and got some real neat restaurants. \n\nIf you\u2019re down on the weekend check out the bars scene. Feel free to DM for any other spots. Enjoy your time in this beautiful town.",

Go to the top of the Manhattan sign. Pointes Ave. Has some cool shops.\n\nHonestly, if you can,  catch a KSU game... any game. The Basketball teams are on fire right now and the baseball team is looking to do great as well!",

Unless the Women opt to accept an invitation to the WNIT and have a high enough seed to gain home court, there won\u2019t be any more basketball on campus this season \ud83d\ude22. But baseball is a solid choice, love me some BatCats. It doesn\u2019t look like any meets for Track &amp; Field in late March, and the football spring game is set for 4/15.",

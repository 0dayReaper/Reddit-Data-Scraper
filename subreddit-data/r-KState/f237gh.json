Absurdly cheap drinks, all bars super close together, and no covers make it one of the best bar districts I\u2019ve seen in a college town.\n\nTypically most underaged students stick to house/frat parties, if the social scene is one of your main priorities I\u2019d consider doing Greek life.\n\nTailgates in the fall are a blast and Fake Patty\u2019s is heralded as one of the best college parties around the country, Manhattan is a quintessential college town and I loved my time there.",

Aggieville is a party scene, nothing more; Mass Street is awesome, but more so for non-partying (shopping, eating, music venues), especially post-college. Don't get me started on house parties, either. The not-insignificant benefit to KU is being less than an hour from KC. Many KU students drive to KC and hit up Westport than stay in Lawrence. Regardless, both MHK and LFK are awesome in their unique ways.\n\nAlso, laughing a bit at your diversity comment \u2014 it's really not much different between the two schools. And for a while K-State's was probably more so with their study abroad relationships. In fact, from a LGBTQ+ perspective, K-State ranked higher than KU on \"friendliness\" this past year. That said, I think we'd all agree Kansas schools have a diversity issue, but that's not easily fixed. Takes time.",

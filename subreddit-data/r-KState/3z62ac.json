    "postText": "So, I'm a Sophomore in Mechanical Engineering. To be completely honest, I'm struggling. Pretty hard core struggling at that. Last semester, I just narrowly missed a C in Calc 3, and am going to have my whole next semester screwed up, because 12 of my 16 credit hours required it as a co-requisite or prerequisite... \n\n\n\nAll of that I intend to fix, and should get in touch with an advisor about, but, my advisor is nothing short of abominable. I scheduled a 30 minute meeting with her to discuss the issues that I have been having about halfway through last semester, and she spent 5-10 minutes berating my performance then asked why I needed 30 minutes when I should \"just follow the flow chart\" for MechE. \n\n\n\nSo in short, I have no idea how to deal with getting a new advisor. All of that is compounded however, by the fact that, well, I can't very well E-mail the dean of student services in engineering, because he died :(\n\n\n\nSo... I'm kind of lost at this point, who do I E-mail to switch advisors? Who do I E-mail about the classes I need to switch? In general, help would be great K-State fam...",

            "comment": "First of all; sorry to hear that you have become discouraged. Hang in there! I had my undergrad advisor suggest that I change out of engineering entirely after my first semester (2.4GPA). I used this as motivation to work harder. My final GPA wasn't stellar (3.3), but I had been involved in other things (Aero Design, etc) that gave me great, marketable, skills. Also, it gets easier as time goes on. The workload is tough, but the classes become more interesting (thermo, fluids, etc). If you understand the material well enough to get a B in Calc 3, you will be able to use that knowledge in future classes. I didn't fair well in the math courses (C in Calc 2, B in Calc 3), but my grades got better as time went on.\n\nIt sounds like your advisor doesn't understand the point of her job, or was busy/having a bad day. It isn't just about following the flowchart, it is about being supportive when students take initiative to talk about their concerns (kudos, BTW).\n\nHave you talked with other Profs (Wanklyn, Beck?), or someone in the main office about changing? I would try to talk to someone in person rather than emailing them at first. If nothing else, seek out another professor that you know to take on some of the advising role.\n\nYou're welcome to PM me if you want any other advice. Best of Luck!\n\n",

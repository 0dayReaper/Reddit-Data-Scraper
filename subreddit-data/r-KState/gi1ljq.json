When I tried getting it through KSIS a few days ago, it said I wasn't a student yet. Anyone know the situation? I'm really excited to get one, so any info would be mega appreciated.",

Typically freshman don\u2019t end up with ICAT because of this, but with everything going on in the world right now who knows if ICAT will sell out early!",

They can definitely point you in the right direction.\n\nNext year for football and basketball are kind of rebuilding years, so you probably have a better chance of getting one before they sellout.",

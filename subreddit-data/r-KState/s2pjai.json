Although the Wefald hall, which is brand new is super nice. \n\nFord, marlatt, and the other two in that complex are very run of the mill dorms that I would not recommend. \n\nEither way, I only stayed in the dorms one year. Some people go two, and RA's are typically third year folks. But no one stays in the dorms their whole time.",

What a close minded thing to do.\n\nAlso, your sentence doesn't even make sense. \"Ford, Marlatt, and the other two in that complex\". Ford and Marlatt are not in the same complex. And if you're talking about Marlatt's complex, one of the other two is Wefald, which you called super nice.\n\nI lived in Marlatt and my experience was nothing short of spectacular.",

    "postText": "*Foreword: I'll only mention first names, for reasons of privacy.*\n\n---\n\nWhile I rode back in a VW from K-State Wesley's CatHawk Challenge, I was with a female Wesley R.A. (name forgotten), Max (the other R.A.) and driven by Shayla. \n\nWe listened to a football game between us and an Oklahoma college, sometime in October 2011.\n\nIn the 4th quarter, the scores being close, I reckoned that \"performance anxiety\" set into our football players. I've had a track record of performing poorer after performance anxiety set in. That's why I told them,\n\n&gt; You know how performance anxiety makes anyone perform poorly because they get worried about the outcome? Now the scores are pretty close, and the game's almost over. I think K-State's about to lose.\n\nMinutes later, K-State did lose. Both teams had a score somewhere in the 40s, IIRC.\n\nDays later, Katie (with Asperger's Syndrome; Aspie Katie hereafter) said that Max told her that I told them K-State was about to lose, minutes before K-State lost. She got furious and told me that \"that's just like telling you that you will never get married in your life.\"\n\nAspie Katie just insulted my future over a one-off comment about a mere football game? It was only a game. Let's examine how much it mattered:\n\n* Did Aspie Katie bet any real money (or any other stakes) on the game's outcome?\n* Was Aspie Katie related to Coach Snyder?\n* Was Aspie Katie related to any of the football players?\n* Did I tell Mr. Snyder HIMSELF that his team was about to lose?\n* Did I tell any of the football players themselves that their team was about to lose?\n\nHow did these words harm Aspie Katie? And anybody in particular? *Whether a game is won or lost will not improve or ruin anybody's life!* Aspie Katie's emotions would only be congruent if a game's outcome (or someone's prediction thereof) would change anybody's life. \n\nLosing a football game doesn't matter, at least not in the long run, if at all.\n\nTelling me I would never get married is like telling Coach Snyder HIMSELF or his team members that their team was about to lose. That's why Aspie Katie's \"analogy\" didn't match.\n\nBy the way, Aspie Katie's \"analogy\" hardened my resolve to find a future spouse. When I resolve a thing or two about my life, I'll make matchmaking profiles on numerous dating sites. I'll even take a marriage class at my current college if I need to.\n\n---\n\n**AMENDMENT 1:** I used to be diagnosed with Asperger's. I was rediagnosed with Schizotypal Personality in 2010. I also had an anxiety diagnosis from 2005.\n\nThen I was re-evaluated at a different mental health agency and diagnosed with the same SPD and anxiety in 2015, along with other disorders that don't really match \"me.\" I second-guessed the new mental health agency even more than the old one, for the extra diagnoses and the other practices they attempted on me that I didn't vibe well with.\n\nThen at my CURRENT mental health agency, I was diagnosed with two types of anxiety disorders, while being \"SUSPECT\" of having Asperger's. That diagnosis and \"suspicion\" happened in August 2016; Asperger's became obsolete in 2013 after DSM-V's publication.\n\n---\n\n**AMENDMENT 2:** Aspie Katie wanted to help me cope better socially, but the way she presented and the tones she used felt more hurtful than helpful, more often than not. \n\nI felt more put-down than built-up and helped. We butted heads frequently; the vibes Aspie Katie gave off didn't really feel all that harmonizing. \n\nShe'd sometimes impose an authority on me that she wasn't assigned to have, even about rules that didn't exist. \n\n(Example: She wanted me to go home because something was wrong with my nose. I still felt well enough to play an XBox game in their recreation room after a Tuesday Night service. Here's what was wrong: \n\n1. I intended to play by myself; I wasn't intending to socialize with anyone, so I wasn't going to spread germs / viruses to anybody.\n\n2. If a Wesley resident had a nose problem / cold / etc., they didn't have to leave the building, and guests could stay to play 'til midnight. My being just as human as they were, I had the right to stay ('til midnight).\n\n3. SHE WAS NOT AN R.A.!!! Even if a rule existed that made any guest leave if they had a common health anomaly, it would not be Aspie Katie's place to impose it! She'd have had to get an R.A. to impose it for her.\n\n4. NO SUCH RULE EXISTED that imposes for guests to leave if they have an illness.)\n\nI know Aspie Katie's heart and intents were in the right places, but her execution was way off and rather disagreeable.\n\n---\n\n**AMENDMENT 3:** Xposted with /r/Aspergers\n\n---\n\n**AMENDMENT 4:** **TLDR:** Aspie Katie flew off the handle about my prediction that K-State was about to lose at a football game in Oklahoma, that K-State did lose a few minutes later.\n\nShe was so furious over that comment, that she attempted an analogy to me by insulting my future by telling me that I'd \"never get married.\"",

It's a bad analogy but it shouldn't be offensive. I think it's like this:\n\n1. You \"predict\" that Kansas will lose, they lose.\n2. She says that predicting a loss is like predicting you won't get married. It's useless to predict because the future is unknown.\n3. She may believe that you \"jinxed\" the game in the same way that saying you won't get married is \"jinxing\" your potential for marriage. If you believe you won't get married, you probably won't.\n\nIt's not a good comparison; you are an active participant in your relationship status. Thinking you will never get married could become a self-fulfilling prophecy because you shy away from relationships, refuse to connect emotionally, etc. You are not an active participant in the football game. Ultimately, I highly doubt she was commenting on your marriage potential. You've misinterpreted the situation. She is saying that *you* predicting a football loss is like *you* predicting you won't get married. Apparently to her this is something a person should never do. \n\nBut honestly, she was probably just upset that they lost. This was half a decade ago, you have to move on.",

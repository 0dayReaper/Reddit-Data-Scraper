However, one can use our regular routes to get close to the stadium but those will run as our traditional Saturday routes and may not be completely available to you during game day. To view that Route, head to the link below:  \nhttps://c38eda83-224f-4f83-8af7-6f92bf95f78b.filesusr.com/ugd/b2f0ee\\_5d94ce4abeea422187e2e5f0291b5920.pdf",

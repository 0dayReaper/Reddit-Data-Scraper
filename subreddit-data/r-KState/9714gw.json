    "postText": "Hey everyone. As the title suggests, me and a few friends will be making the trip up to Manhattan from Starkville, MS to watch the Miss. St./ KSU game here on Sept. 8th.  We're booked for a two night stay at a AirBNB in the area, but outside of the game, we've no idea what there is to do/eat up there. Any recommendations on unique eats, locations, or activities while we're up there would be greatly appreciated.  \n\nAlso, what are the traditions at K-State we CLANGAS might need to be aware of before heading in.

Also, the Tap House brewery downtown has a great beer selection and a chill vibe if that's your thing. If you are into golf, bring your clubs and hit up Colbert Hills. The layout is excellent and one of the top courses in the state. \n\nOn the flip side, we are most likely going to take a trip out that way for next year's game. What is the inside scoop for that area? TIA ",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the insight.  Well from everything I've heard, Manhattan is a lot like Starkville. Very small town feel outside of campus. Our Aggieland is The Cotton District. Compared to other colleges, our bar scene is pretty limited but definitely shouldn't be overlooked. The BIN 612 has some the best bar food around with Gringo's and The Fountain making the best mixed drinks. Just across the street from them are Two Brothers Smoked Meats if you care much for BBQ and the like. I highly recommend going to either Bulldog Burger (burgers/grill) or Stromboli's (Pizza) down the street from the bars and getting the Freshmen 15 or Stromboli, respectively. Other places I recommend to eat in town include: La Terraza (Mexican), Little Dooey's (BBQ), Mugshots (burgers) and Umi (Japanese). \n\nOn Campus, you have to go to Mafes Creamery and get some Ice Cream and a wheel of cheese to bring back with you. Miss State makes all its own dairy products on campus. From there, stop by the Junction (right in front of the stadium) which is our major hub for tailgating before/after games. The Drill Field (named for its use by drilling cadets) is the center of campus with a huge open field surrounded by engineering row, The Mitchell Memorial Library, and the business school. \n\nOne last thing, BRING EARPLUGS if your going inside the stadium. We are one of the, if not the only school that is allowed artificial noise makers inside a stadium and we make the most of it with our cowbells. ",

If you're looking for some more higher end drinking, hope over to Della Voce, Harry's, or Wine Dive.\n\nIf you want to go to a more hip place, check out Auntie Maes. It's underground, and has decent enough prices. If you just want to get hammered, go to Dirty Dogs, Tubbys, or Kites. All of them have dance floors. And cheap beer. And bar fights.",

Even OU fans are kinda surprised by how nice we are to them when they visit our stadium. There's not a lot of hazing unless you're a Nebraska fan. We don't really do anything with any kind of noise makers. The Wabash Cannonball is the *big* crowd-participation event there other than various chants. Definitely look at the student section during pregame for that.\n\nThat being said, there's not a ton to do in Manhattan other than drink in Aggieville.  \n\nThere are some good restaurants to check out - or at least there were a long time ago. Little Apple Brewing Co. was really good when I went there. Bluestem Bistro was supposed to be good, too.\n\nI don't know if you're into board games or anything like that, but Goblin Games is a cool little shop with a ton of tables for gaming and they sell a good number of games too.\n\nI loved college in Manhattan but it's not a big city and there's not a ton to do outside of sports games and going to Aggieville. Kinda the same vibe I got from Starkville when I checked out your campus in like 2006.",

Don't down talk aggieville, they have added a lot of restaurants and old downtown is really getting revamped with Tallgrass setting up shop! If you aren't looking to party in the 'Ville make sure you get out by nine or so. \n\n\nWhatever you do, eat at so long and taco Lucha,after that stroll through campus and admire Anderson hall and Hale library (which is unfortunately closed due to a fire)! When in doubt ask the locals, it is a friendly place...even for opposing fans ;) ",

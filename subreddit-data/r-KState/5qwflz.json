    "postText": "Don't Be A Victim! Safety4Students (a nonprofit organization) is collecting survey responses about student's concerns regarding safety! If you have a moment, please consider taking our survey. All responses will remain anonymous. Doing so will also help improve the safety students are provided in general, not just within school and help prepare younger generations for the future! This will also help parents and guardians be more aware of what children are concerned about, which provides insight on what they may focus on to provide their children and themselves security. \nFor further information, feel free to reply, send me a message, or stop by the official page on Facebook. As for incentive, respondents will be entered in a raffle to win a $500 gift card! The link to the survey will be provided below.\nThank you and have a great day! :)\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Safety4Students",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nEarlier this year when I was filling out my Jardine application I was told I could move in July.\n\nBut I looked at my contract the other day and it said August. I called Jardine and they said that regardless of non-traditional status, if it's my first time in Jardine, I can't move in til August.\n\nAnyone else have experience with this?",

            "comment": "Previous Jardine resident here. From what I understand and have experienced, people who are new the complex are not able to move in until the beginning of August. This was the same for my roommates and I when we moved in two years ago. \n\nUnless the contract is renewed the lease ends at the end of the following June by which time all previous tenants need to have checked out. My guess is that they take the time in July to thoroughly clean the apartments and do any repair to them if necessary.\n\nThis might not be 100% true but it is my best guess to why you won't be able to move in until the beginning of August. Hope this helps.",

If you are new to jardine you cant move in until august but if your a current resident in jardine and are just switching apartments they let you into your new apartment usually some time during late June or early July.",

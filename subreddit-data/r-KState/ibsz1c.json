    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nAs titled I'm looking for roommates (preferably students) for the upcoming school year, I live close to campus on Sunset Ave. The rent is $336 a month plus electric, everything else is included in the rent pay. The apartment is a 3 bedroom, 2 bath place with a decent living room and kitchen size as well. There is a laundry room for the whole building but it never seems to be that busy. If you're interested DM me or reply here and I'll get in contact with you!",

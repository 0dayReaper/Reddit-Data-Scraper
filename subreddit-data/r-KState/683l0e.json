Not much of a partier so I was thinking Auntie Maes, any other places? Go do drinks, etc? \n\nThanks guys! Go Cats",

Kites and Kaws turns into more dance clubs. The yardbar (rusty's) is a new place I haven't been to yet; but looks like they have yard games in the courtyard which can be pretty dope if your starting with a few beers.",

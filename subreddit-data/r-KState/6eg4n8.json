    "postText": "Hey,\n\nSo I'm going to be moving to the area shortly. I was wondering if there were any recommended gyms in Manhattan or the surrounding area. \n\nI'm not going to be affiliated with the school, so I'm not sure that a membership to their gyms is available to me (please correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nI'm mostly interested in free weights and cardio equipment. Machines are a plus, but not really necessary. \n\nThanks!",

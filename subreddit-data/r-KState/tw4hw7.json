If it\u2019s just you on the contract and you\u2019re the only resident, you can have guests but someone might notice someone else lives there. You\u2019ll also only have one key (I think) and only you would have a Jardine parking permit. I\u2019m sure people try anyways but YMMV.\n\nIf living together is important to you, I\u2019d agree that off campus is just easiest.",

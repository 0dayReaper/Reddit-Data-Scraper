    "postText": "I know it's not exactly apartment-hunting season for students, but I wanted to share with my fellow Wildcats that somebody who presumably works for Gramercy has been posting thinly-veiled ads for that apartment complex on this subreddit for years. Please report these posts if you see them. [See this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KState/comments/svqujc/looking_for_a_place_to_live/) and the comment within for examples and links to previous advertisements posted.\n\nIn truth, the Gramercy apartment complex is a filthy, infested, noisy (even for a college apt complex), dangerous, broken down cesspool. They prey on freshmen with \"location near the football stadium\", \"nice amenities\", and \"low rent\".\n\nWhile the location and rent price are not arguable, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KState/comments/hklztz/do_not_move_to_the_gramercy_crosspost/) does a nice job summing up what you can expect living there.",

            "comment": "&gt; \"location near the football stadium\"\n\nI graduated 7 years ago now and even then the Gramercy apartments were known for being shit and I never did understand how this line in particular was a selling point. Sure, you're close to the football stadium and can get there easily....for the 7 home football games. So 7 days a year it's convenient for one thing (forget trying to go anywhere else if you're not going to the game). The rest of the year, you're a long ass ways from campus, you're even further from Aggieville, there are no other amenities like grocery stores or restaurants nearby. It's about the worst location you could think of to live in Manhattan as a student.",

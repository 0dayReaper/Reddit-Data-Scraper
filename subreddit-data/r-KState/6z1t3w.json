The other is MU - this should sound obvious for the area, but the point I really want to make is that we only even look at KU grads for Civil... an argument for whether they deserve that based on the quality of their program is a different story (it's a good program), I just know that having a degree from KSU can help you get a job in this industry. Check national rankings, as well as return on investment lists. ",

We only recruit at a handful of universities across the country, and K-State is the only school in Kansas that we look at.\n\nFor internships, we only hire interns from our \"targeted schools\" - and K-State is in our top tier of targeted schools. For full time hires after graduation, 90% of them were summer interns. The other 10% are almost always filled at fall career fairs at the targeted schools.\n\nIf you're trying to decide where to go to school, think about companies you'd like to work for. Do some research on LinkedIn and see where their engineers went to school. That will give you some insight about where they recruit. ",

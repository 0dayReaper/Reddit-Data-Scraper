    "postText": "I am in search for a subleasor for my apartment starting August of 2018.\n The name is The Gramercy apartments and they are located at 2215 College Ave. Manhattan, Kansas 66502, just a walking distance away from the football stadium. My current rent rate is $315 per month and my lease ends in May of 2019 The only utilities that you will be responsible for is electricity and water and the average for both is about $50 per month.  The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable and internet.  Another great thing about subleasing is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my subleasor and you can move into any apartment within the complex.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me at 785-317-2700  If you would like to set up a tour or have any additional questions you can contact the leasing manager at 785-539-0500.\n\n amenities included are:\n\n24-hour Fitness Center\n24-hour Computer Lab with FREE Printing \nWasher &amp; Dryer in each unit\nFree Tanning\nBasketball Court\nTennis Court\nOutdoor, in-ground Pool\nClubhouse including Pool Table and TV (cable provided)\nPatio Area with Barbecue Grill\nOn-Site Management &amp; Maintenance\nIndividual Leasing\nFully Furnished Apartments\nOn-Site Parking\nRoommate Matching Service\nFree Shuttle Service to Kansas State University\nFree Coffee Bar located in the Leasing Office\n ",

    "postText": "Just wanting to let everyone know that we started a new Podcast hoping to give some insight into the industry for anyone pursuing a career in construction. We are a SoCal (Anaheim) Contractor who does a lot of work for most of the Regional/National/International Players, and have developed some good relationships over the years with many of the G.C.'s \n\nWe see people often asking what path they should take in their career or what certain Jobs entail. We are trying to answer those questions. We would love to hear from any listeners on how to improve, or what would be more useful to you in your career. \n\nAnyway, it\u2019s a labor of love on our part, and we hope you can both enjoy it and benefit from it. We are shooting for release 1 new episode on the first of each month at the moment. We will see if there is any interest as things move forward!\n\n**ConstructionCareerPodcast**\n\n[Find us on Itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-construction-career-podcast/id1372819335?mt=2)\n\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/music/m/Izm25y4igsde5schol7dvvmv3qu?t=The_Construction_Career_Podcast)\n\n[Or the Website](http://constructioncareerpodcast.com/wp/category/podcast/)",

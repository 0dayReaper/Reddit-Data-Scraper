It will seam like they will know everyone and everything so they will help you navigate manhattan, class, the dorms, etc. I have been the mentor and mentee and it's a great thing. \nOther things: Taco lucha is where you want to go when your parents are in town, manhattan hill is where you want to take a date (or the k state gardens if you don't have a car), pizza shuttle is for Sunday night dinners, don't go to Tubbys on Thursday (I know they let in 18 year olds but it's not worth it), and arrow has he best coffee. It's right across the street to you so I'd go there all the time.   \n\n\nIf you have any specific questions feel free to ask. ",

Consider the pizza shuttle flop if you don't like your pizza super greasy, turn the box over before you open it and drop it on the ground, knocks about half the grease off.\n\nAlso, make friends. Be open to new experiences. Hang out in the lobby if you don't have anything better to do",

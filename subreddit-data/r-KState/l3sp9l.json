    "postText": "&gt;!READY To Release/ Application fee on me!!!!!!!&lt;\n\nI am in search of a relet for my apartment starting (February 1, 2021).\n\nI can tell you a little bit about the apartment complex.\u00a0 The name is the Gramercy Apartments located at 2215 College Ave. Manhattan, Kansas 66502.\u00a0 It is located just a walking distance away from the football stadium. My current rent rate is ***$399.00 per bedroom for a 4-bedroom floor plan or $519.00 per bedroom for a 2-bedroom floor plan with the lease ending July 31st, 2021***.\u00a0 You will be responsible for electricity and water (IF OVER THE $30.00 ALOTTED AMOUNT). \u00a0 The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable, and internet.\u00a0 Another great thing about reletting is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my relet and you can move into any apartment within the complex.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me at [i.ndiaa@yahoo.com](mailto:i.ndiaa@yahoo.com)\u00a0or 478-747-5226 **India Turk**.

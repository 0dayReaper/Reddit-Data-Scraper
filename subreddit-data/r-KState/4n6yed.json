He says that what allowed Snyder to be successful thus far has and is being exploited now by other teams and coaches, which renders Snyder's strengths weakened.\n\nHe also says that Snyder is very out of touch with the players and coaches on his staff and frequently forgets names, positions, etc.. \n\nDoes this sound like it may be true to anyone else? I have nothing to compare it too, so it's hard to form an opinion. ",

I'd be thrilled if I could keep such a spectacular job so late in life and still perform half the functions expected of me. Maybe he's letting more and more things slip by, but by that age I imagine I would have a hard time giving a damn about anything, so the fact that he is as successful as he is is phenomenal to me. ",

We had a down year last year but there are things to remember. We lost our named starter on the first play of the year and then a young backup in I think the second game. We also lost our main dbacks early on with season ending injuries. Even with that we hung with TCU, OSU and Baylor, then won our last three to go bowling. A solid experienced qb and a healthy defense very well could've changed all three outcomes and finishing the regular season 9-3 is nothing to be disappointed in. ",

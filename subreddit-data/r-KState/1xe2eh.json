Looks like we played the [Roos](http://www.umkckangaroos.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPSID=89987&amp;SPID=10799&amp;DB_OEM_ID=18300&amp;Q_SEASON=2012) last season.  It was played in Bramlage and aired by Fox Sports (which they had to use since New Girl is on Fox).  \n\nBut this brings up a new point.  That they purposely had to go back and look for this game.  They didn't just use footage from any old MBB game from Fox Sports... ",

    "postText": "A white iPhone 6 was found in the parking area of the Grain Science Complex (across the street from the Football Stadium), and it was probably left after the September 5th game. It finally just now dried out enough to start, and we think that it belongs to a person named Joe.\n\nI've tried several ways to get in touch with the owner, but so far nothing has panned out. PM me if you might know who it belongs to!",

Alternatively, you might be able to search KSU's student directory and find that number.\n\nI'm so grateful I go to a university where people actually put this kind of effort into giving someone's phone back.

They directed me to call customer care, and so I had a mini conference call with a customer service rep and an Apple rep. They both just suggested I turn it in RCPD, so that's the next step! \n\nThanks! It's definitely the right thing to do!",

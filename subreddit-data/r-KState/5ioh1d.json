    "postText": "Hello! I am currently a high school senior, and I have a few questions regarding K-State. First, what is the computer science program at K-State like compared to other Kansas schools? I have toured the facilities and they seem very nice, but I just don't want to be fooled by some smoke and mirrors. Secondly, I am having a hard time deciding between dorms. My two current options are Goodnow and Wefald. I like the design of the square rooms in Goodnow, but the modern facilities and closets of Wefald are enticing. What are your thoughts?\n\nThank you for your responses,\n        Potential Wildcat",

            "comment": "Hmm, I lived in Goodnow once upon a time. It wasn't so bad to be honest, but Wefald definitely has it's benefits. I would probably take a Wefald room given the opportunity to do it all again, just because the extra space would have been nice.\n\nAs far as the CS degree goes? I've heard a lot of good things, and a few bad things. Sadly, as with any other university, it all really depends on what teachers you end up with. A bad teacher will ruin your experience. I've been here for a couple years now, and usually get about one bad teacher a semester, but I'm a M.E., so YMMV. That being said, there is plenty of help available to tough out the bad eggs!",

            "comment": "From my understanding CS is really good at k-state. The whole engineering department is very strong, and CS technically falls under it. I know tons of CS majors and they all spend a lot of time studying for it and say it's extremely difficult, so that's probably a good sign. \n\nCan't really tell ya much about the dorms, but if you have any questions and no one more qualified than I posts on here, pm me and I'll help you as much as I can.",

My floor was loud, obnoxious, crazy, stank, and the internet was awful. In December, I moved to Marlatt and it's much better. It doesn't look as modern as Wefald and there is a little less room, but I think Marlatt's pretty great. Hopefully they'll renovate Goodnow soon like they did with Marlatt already.",

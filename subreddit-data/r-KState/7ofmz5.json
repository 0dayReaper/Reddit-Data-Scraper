For a little more casual bar and grill type place Little Apple Brewery is a good locally owned.\n\nGood luck with your interview! All the faculty are very nice.  - I'm a 2017 DVM grad.\n\nEdit: Also, if you can, hit up The Chef for breakfast.  There's always a wait if you don't go early, but it's worth it.  Their hash browns are bomb. ",

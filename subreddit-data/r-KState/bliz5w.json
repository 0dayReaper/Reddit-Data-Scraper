    "postText": "Hey r/KState\n\nCurrently K-State is my number one choice to attend for my masters program (Urban &amp; Regional Planning) and will be applying there this month to attend in the spring of 2020 as I am currently finishing up my undergrad here at the University of Idaho. I was just wondering what all of your thoughts on K-State were? What's the atmosphere like? The weather? The bar/food scene? I will be moving out there with my girlfriend and would like to get a feel for the area. Unfortunately I can't visit until October and can only get so much from a google search \n\nThanks for whatever information you guys can provide!",

What are the first three things you would want someone to see if they visited you?  \n\nFor KSU, I would like you to see the burning of the Konza prairie every spring.  That ribbon of fire across the hills is amazing.  I enjoyed the campus rec center to reset my mind.  Last, Aggieville.  The memories of that are blurry.\n\nI hope your trip in October goes great!",

            "comment": "Try to live near campus if you can. It costs a little more, but if you can walk to campus you will never need your car. Cheaper rent might sound great, but parking is an absolute nightmare in Manhattan. Parking passes are expensive and definitely offset that cheaper rent. If you're within walking/biking distance it's worth a little extra every month. \n\nAggieville is the bar district. It's a lot of fun.\n\nDillons is the local grocery store. They're pretty much identical to any other Kroger-style grocery store. There are 4 (I think) Around town. \n\nManhattan is near a military base called Fort Riely. \"Riely rats\" are soldiers on leave, typically causing trouble in aggieville, or racing the cars they paid too much for. They're pretty annoying but not an everyday encounter either. Couple times a month. \n\nThe new movie theater is pretty great. \n\nIf you're an outdoorsman KS might disappoint. But the Konza is a pretty sight at sunset. \n\nThe spork statue will randomly have babies. This is considered normal and no cause for alarm. \n\nThe National Bio Ag Defence Facility will probably (finally) be up and running while you're there. It's supposed to double the size of Manhattan by 2025. (From 30,000 year round residents to 60,000) so Manhattan is expecting a good amount of growth in the near future. \n\nIf you like canoeing you almost certainly have to wait till after a good rain. Our rivers aren't deep. \n\nI don't know what Idaho weather is like, KS gets hot in the summer (weeks on end all over 100F) and pretty cold in the winter (down to around 0) we also get more ice than snow when it's cold. Although the area tends to be pretty dry overall. \n\nThat's all I can think of at the moment. But I'd be happy to answer any other questions.",

About the same distance, probably would just depend on which flights you can find cheaper. Manhattan has a regional airport if you want to fly to Chicago or DFW, also.\n\nWe have some hot summers (90s are common, some days hit triple digits) and some cold winters too. This year we had more snow than typical it seems, but no more than 6-8\u201d at a time. It doesn\u2019t get below 0 super frequently, but it will probably a dozen or so nights a year. A couple years ago we had a freak night that got to like -15 or something. I\u2019d say a typical winter week hovers  between 10-20 degrees in January. Bring some warm clothes!\n\nNinja edit: I didn\u2019t see your roads question. They\u2019re okay. Like many places around the country we have potholes galore right now, but it was a rough winter. I think the city is pretty decent about treating the roads and plowing snow. For reference, the university had a half-day snow day this year, but the school district had like 8-9 snow days (in my opinion, they didn\u2019t need nearly that many).",

They will come in a bank statement before the 22nd, lemme find the path in ksis to show your pending scholarships real quick.\n\nEdit: are you out of state?\n\nEdit 2: Go to ksis, student center, finances, my account, pay now, then there's a tab on the far right of the tabs that shows your pending scholarships called \"pending aid\" :D\n\nIt had me worried too, but it's going to work out. If it doesn't show it in that section then call, but it's probably nothing to be worried about (hopefully).",

My friend and I have a podcast we started during our elite 8 run and we are still going strong. \n\nWe have had other fans, former players, other kstate media all on the show. Also we have a high profile guest on later this summer that we are keeping secret. \n\nYou can listen on iTunes, google play, Pippa and soon Spotify. \n\nIn this episode, we draft our all time snyder players into two teams against each other. It was fun and it gets you thinkin! I hope you enjoy it. \n\nPippa: https://shows.pippa.io/5aeb9030076a3eaa70561f84/dad-pod\n\niTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/boscoes-boys/id1361339892?mt=2&amp;i=1000414533960",

Would love to get some opinions on this. Should I stay in the dorms first to get a feel for things or should I commit to at frat?",

Fiji has a pretty poor reputation and the living arrangements are comparatively worse than anywhere else I\u2019ve seen. \n\nDepending on what you\u2019re looking for, SAE is probably your best choice based on location (right across from campus), reputation, and living arrangements. \n\nTheta Xi just remodeled their house so it is likely very nice (I haven\u2019t seen the interior) but it\u2019s a couple blocks from campus. \n\nIf you don\u2019t mind a stricter lifestyle, Farmhouse is well loved across campus, and is pretty close too.",

I am an engineering student, both houses I've heard support that well and are very close to the engineering building. My only concern with Theta Xi is since they are a smaller organization I don't know how the involvement is with alumni as well as other fraternities.",

That\u2019s when classes are easiest and you can devote more time to their rituals and initiation process. Especially for engineering, I couldn\u2019t even imagine trying to go through the process now (junior) with my workload. \n\nI hope this helped!",

Free time is kind of fluid, it really depends on how many credit hours you\u2019re taking. I like taking 18 credit hour semesters but that\u2019s a lot more than most people take. I don\u2019t have a ton of free time as a result but i work on the quarter scale tractor team in the time I have. \n\nThere\u2019s about 500 clubs and organizations at K-State. Some are based on fun extracurriculars, like Star Wars or swing dancing, but also there are a lot of really good time investments like engineering ambassadors, ELI, and other development programs that I\u2019m involved with. I highly recommend finding one of these programs and getting involved. \n\nIn general, i typically say to find one design team, one career development program, and one or more fun extracurriculars to do. \n\nFinally, frats usually host tailgates before each football game, and then go to games as a group. They definitely aren\u2019t required events but they\u2019re fun ways to relax with your brothers. I know that SAE and Theta Xi usually have big ones. I\u2019m pretty sure that as a member you\u2019re free to attend but some frats do things differently than others.",

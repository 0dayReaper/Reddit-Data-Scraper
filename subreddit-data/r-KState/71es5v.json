Are there any caves or old mines near campus that we could go explore?\n\nAny other type of exploration areas that you could recommend would be awesome, just looking for some fun adventures.\n\nThanks!",

There are some cool mountain bike trails down on the river too. No caves that I know of. Get out and explore. So much fun outdoor activities around hat town.\n\nPS: the spillway at Tuttle is a good place to find fossils and what not. ",

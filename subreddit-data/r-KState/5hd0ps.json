I'm a girl so there are always frat parties (join a frat/sorority if you want lots of parties to go to) but there is also always a Halloween/Christmas/Fakepaties party. We have Tubbies and a few other 18&amp;under bars. Once you're 21 aggieville has a ton of bars. Also, in my major (architecture) people host parties a lot. ",

There's a variety of things going on. \n\nI know I'll get shit on for saying this, but PLEASE, this shouldn't even be a thing on your radar when picking a school. Honestly, seeing this question frustrated me a bit. \n\nThis university has one of the happiest student bodies/campuses in the United States. Surprising to most people, the university was ranked in the top 20 for most accepting of LGBTQ students with their wonderful club on campus (last I heard). \n\nAnd Manhattan is close to my heart. My mother grew up there, and I still have a grandmother there in town. It's one of the best towns to live in while in college. You have everything you need, it's cozy, welcoming, and you got a little bit of everything. The townies are nice, which always blew my mind because I'm sure students get annoying after a while. And the summers there are still my favorite - the population drops by about half, so all the beer in Aggieville feels like it's for you. \n\nIf I could handle small-town life long term when I'm old, I'd retire there in a heartbeat. \n\nBack to your question - it's a state school, so that should tell you enough. There's plenty to do like any other university. And I understand the social aspect is important. But it's offensive to the many many unique things about this university's social dynamic to boil it down to their parties. \n\nMy friends and I who all worked at the custom shirt shop threw awesome parties. But what I remember most about my time there weren't necessarily the parties or the tailgating for football games, but rather how incredible it was to be in Manhattan. ",

But was trying to point out how KSU is a great choice for other social reasons than just that. \n\nPeople I know like going to Manhattan on random weekends just to go out because the whole town is great. We're one of the few schools that surprises a lot of people in how great our community is, and was trying to bring that up instead of just focusing on partying. \n\nI'm not looking for anything to be mad about. I don't want them to miss out on hearing about the other things (socially) about going out in MHK that made it so great. Cause there are probly plenty of schools who would be a better place for parties. Like how at KU you can get into more bars as a minor than in Aggieville, so it's house party central for a while. I'm stereotypically gay, and while I was in school I felt so much safer than the bigger city I live in now which says a lot about the community. Weekends in MHK felt like huge parties because of that community feel that I was trying to get across. And that translates from the classroom to the bars.\n\nJust asking about parties in regards to kstate misses so many things about our school that make it great. I'm not mad. I loved partying there. Shit, sometimes on my way to the studio I'd get offered shots by people partying on their front porches. So it's not just about how good the parties are. It's about the people there. The people are what define a lot of the potential experiences you can have in college. KSU didn't feel fragmented, it legit felt like one big family. And if a tight community dynamic is what they want then this is the place. Or if they want a place where they can bounce around from group to group in a bigger pond and be a little more isolated in their social circles, then that's a little different.",

Their question made me wonder if they had any previous exposure to the university from the prospective of family or peers. A lot of people I met while there were from out of state because tuition there was cheaper than in-state where they were from. So I thought it was safer to assume they hadn't been able to hear all the other awesome parts about here that make us not only a better party school than others in Kansas (in my opinion), but just a great place to be day to day in general. Because the the things that make the party scene great are also what make being a part of campus a great experience.",

    "postText": "I am in search of a relet for my apartment starting August 8th. \nI can tell you a little bit about the apartment complex.  The name is the Gramercy Apartments located at 2215 College Ave. Manhattan, Kansas 66502.  It\u2019s located just a walking distance away from the football stadium. My current rent rate is $399 for a four person apartment and my lease ends on July 31, 2021.  You will be responsible for electricity and water (IF OVER THE $30.00 ALOTTED AMOUNT). The average for electricity is about $100 per month.  The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable, and internet.  Another great thing about reletting is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my relet and you can move into any apartment within the complex.\n\nIf you have any questions please contact me, I look forward to hearing from you!",

There's no shortage of people who went nuts at the start of the year with partying, gaming all night, not studying, all the freedom, etc. \n\nCertainly have fun, but also get yourself into a routine for studying first then add stuff on top of that. Also, exercise regularly and avoid the 'freshman 15' (seriously, eat salad for one meal a day and hit the gym).",

I remember sophomore year having friends who I'd expected to spend 4-5 years move back home as casualties of too much partying.  \n\n\nIf on/near campus, I recommend selling your car and walking everywhere.  You'll be in better shape and one less thing to maintain.  With Uber and the ATA bus, there are a lot better options for getting around town than there were when I was a student.",

            "comment": "Ford is notorious for drama and strict rules. \n\nAll dorms have the same rules but it\u2019s harder to sneak guys in a dorm that\u2019s all girls. Don\u2019t really know why people bother sneaking though. \n\nIf you\u2019re really sheltered, partying will not make you more well rounded. \n\nPick your priorities. 99% of success in college is prioritizing the important things. Anyone who flunks out chose to put social life ahead of class. Personally, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard to do both. Work then play. \n\nIn regards to your faith, there are a lot of religious groups on campus that revolve around the realistic aspect of modern life whole remaining true to your faith. I\u2019d look into it. \nBut I also want to warn you that the easiest way to get people to dislike you is to judge others based on your faith/values. Obviously we all have morals and ethics, but those are the things that would exist outside of your faith. It\u2019s all heavy I\u2019m sorry but I also know a few people who went to college with strong faith and judgements, and that just came with alienating people and eventually transferring or dropping out. But I promise that there are people exactly like you who want to study any dedication but also be a normal person who is realistic about the things around them! \n\nUseful items: \n- Reusable bags, I like the freezer bags from Sam\u2019s club\n- microwave and fridge (me and my roommate each provided one) \n- fan. Tower fans are my best friend\n- if you are sensitive to noise , ear plugs\n- wireless headphones. It\u2019s just easier. \n- lanyard. Most people have one but again, makes life easier. \n- some type of lamp, lights that you can adjust on your side of the room. It\u2019s nice when one of you is trying to sleep but you still need light. \n- give your parents a list of snacks you like. Especially ones that can be sent through amazon prime. People will ask what you like and if it\u2019s on amazon prime, you will get it sent to you. \n- STORAGE. Make everything compact. I have a travel sized hair dryer. I don\u2019t need a big one. I keep my makeup in a caboodle. I love those little three tiered carts. All great. \n- get an nespresso machine instead of Keurig. Way better, way nicer. Same priced machine. \n- command strips were invented by Jesus in college. I bought so many and have 0 qualms. Literally hung curtain rods and curtains with them. \n\nLast but unrelated: when you go home, look around your room. Bring back anything you don\u2019t use. Sometimes it\u2019s clothes, sometimes it\u2019s other stuff. It takes 5 minutes and you\u2019ll always grab something. \n\nAlso take a second to look at all of the things you can do in the library. There\u2019s a lot that goes unused like computers with Adobe stuff, etc. \n\nThat\u2019s a lot, but just things I wish I knew when I started. You\u2019ll love it. Good luck!",

            "comment": "From the perspective of a junior at K-State that is NOT  and has never been in the party scene: be aware of your surroundings when partying. Of course this means be safe, look both ways before you cross the road, yada yada\u2026 but also, please watch the noise levels and be aware of personal space. I used to live in an apartment right next to Aggie (got a great deal I couldn\u2019t resist, price-wise) and the amount of nights I was kept awake by drunk and/or rowdy college kids passing by is too many. I also used to find stuff on or around my car that certainly didn\u2019t belong to me (one time, it was an expired gallon of milk on the hood of my car, for example). Of course it\u2019s okay to have fun, it\u2019s okay to get excited, but be mindful of other people when you\u2019re out and about :)",

Auditions are typically in-person the first week of classes, with excerpts posted on August 1st here: https://www.k-state.edu/band/index.html. Non-majors can typically take individual lessons with their faculty instructor, I've had a good experience with those too. \n\nThe fall is dominated by The Pride of Wildcat Land in the band program, its the highlight of my year! If you want to march, shoot me a message and I can get you connected with the correct people for your instrument. Music majors aren't even the most common major in the marching band, so don't let your major keep you from doing it!\n\nOn a non-band related note, the first week of classes there is an Activities Carnival in the Union. It's a great place to see what clubs are active on campus. Campus Labs is the website used to manage clubs, you can find listings there too.",

Fun fact: our student government controls 100% of where your campus privilege fee goes. When you add that up for every student paying, the total budget is about $16 million that is controlled entirely by students. It is so much fun and not at all like high school student council or anything. Feel free to pm me if you want more info!",

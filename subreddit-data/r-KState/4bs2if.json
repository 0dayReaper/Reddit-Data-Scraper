            "comment": "Go once or twice, and see what you think. If you need ongoing treatment or counseling, though, you probably want to find an actual psychologist (or psychiatrist, depending on your needs) to see on a regular basis.\n\nMy experience with the campus counseling services was not great. I had a history of un-diagnosed depression from childhood onward, and it came to something of a head when I was a freshman here. After a 15-minute appointment with the staff psychiatrist, I was given prescriptions for antidepressants and Ambien. A couple months later, another 15-minute appointment had them upping the dosage. I met with a grad student counselor several times (Possibly weekly? I don't quite remember.) over the course of the Spring semester. This student counselor basically told me I needed to learn how to relax, but gave no instruction, advice, or tools for me to use to do so. At the end of the Spring semester, I was told that I was not eligible for any services over the summer because I was not enrolled in summer classes. I was not referred to any type of counseling outside of the university, I was simply told that I would not get counseling over the summer. Period.\n\nBy the time Fall rolled around, I had no desire to go back. My family doctor continued prescribing the antidepressants for a while before I decided to stop taking them, but I have not received any kind of counseling or therapy since I was a college freshman over 10 years ago. Things may have changed since that time, I don't know. Maybe I just got the dud grad student.\n\nI do know that I probably need to be seeing a therapist, and my experiences with the campus counseling services over a decade ago have made it that much harder for me to try to find one.\n\nI will say that if the choices are between campus counseling and not getting any help at all, then definitely go to the counseling center at least once. As negatively as I remember that place, I probably would have been a lot worse off if I hadn't gone.",

I think experiences can be mixed and if you don't click with your counselor, ask for a different one. Although I will say that no one form of therapy will make everything feel better, reaching out for help is always a good step. \n\nOne thing I found particularly helpful about counseling services was that they're able to work with the office of student life. I hit a rough patch and really just needed to take a few days off (which included a test) and they worked with my professors so that it didn't hurt my grades.\n\nIf you're struggling, seek help. ",

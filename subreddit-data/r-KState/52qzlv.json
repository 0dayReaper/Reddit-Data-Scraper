(For example: Trimming my cat's claws used to be included in an annual check-up, last time I was there it was extra and $5/paw.) I stopped taking my cat there after the third year in a row they tried to con me into spending $500 for them to clean her teeth. (I never let them do it, and the cat's mouth is still fine.)",

This is not a young cat, and I don't see the point of putting her through the stress of anesthesia when it's not immediately necessary.",

Waiting until she's having oral issues is irresponsible, frankly.\n\nThink of it this way: would you just not go to the dentist until you started losing weight because eating hurt? Or do you get check ups and cleanings to prevent issues?\n\nAlso 7 is not old enough that her age makes her an anesthesia risk... Especially not at 4, which is when you said this started. ",

I said I put up with it for 3 years in a row, 7 years ago, and then stopped going to that clinic. Little Apple seemed to think that 7 years old (her estimated age when this started) WAS old enough to be an anesthesia risk, so now that she's 14? All I know is, no other vet has shown the same level of interest in her teeth before or since. Thanks for your concern, but I think I'm done with this conversation.\n",

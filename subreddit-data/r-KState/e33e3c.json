    "postText": "!I am reletting my room in my four bedroom apartment in The Gramercy apartment complex! It is a fantastic place to live! \nA little bit about the apartment complex. The name is the Gramercy Apartments located at 2215 College Ave. Manhattan, Kansas 66502. It\u2019s located just a walking distance away from the football stadium. My current rent rate is\u00a0$399 a month with some additional costs for water and electricity if over the $30 slotted amount that usually puts my total at about $420 each month and my lease ends on July 31st 2020.\u00a0 The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable, and internet. Another great thing about reletting is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be\u00a0my relet and you can move into any apartment within the complex! Also this apartment has TONS of great amenities! There's free printing (which is great for college students) a pool for the summer, a great gym that I believe is open 24 hrs, there's a Starbucks coffee that you can use just for free in the clubhouse and lots of computers you can use in the clubhouse! There's also a tennis court, basketball court and I think they're gonna put in a dog park soon! If you are interested, and have more questions, you can email thegramercy@clsliving.com! If you email, make sure to mention that you are MY relet prospect! My name is Emma Lansdowne in apartment 305!",

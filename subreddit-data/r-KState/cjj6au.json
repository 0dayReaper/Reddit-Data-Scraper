I've heard from many people to ignore stereotypes because every house is pretty much the same and you'll have a good experience where ever you go. I'm asking everyone who replies to this but would you mind telling me what house you were/are in? I'm going to use it to help me remember all the different houses when I start recruitment week. I promise I won't let it sway my judgement, it would just help me remember the chapter and what it was like when I'm voting!",

            "comment": "Hi!  I rushed last year and it was a lot of fun. Basically you will be spend the first two days seeing all the houses. During this time it\u2019s a good idea to write down all of your thoughts about the houses. I liked to write down what I liked about the house, the people I met, and anything that I really liked or dislike. Next you get to \u2018vote on which are your favorite and least favorite houses. The houses decide whether or not they like you. The next day you get a new schedule with the houses that liked you / you liked. Then you visit the houses and vote some more until the last night, bid night. Everyone gets to open a letter that tells them what houses they are in. Then they all run to the front of Anderson to meet their sisters and party. The people who people who run rush explain all this better. Good luck and have fun!",

There really isnt one that is objectively better than the other. It is about where you connect with, not what you think others should expect of you.",

Regardless, I still met a lot of great people in that house, made some great memories, and I\u2019m still friends with a couple of girls.\nIf you want to learn more about each specific house your should look up sororities on the k-state website. Then look them up on Social media. That should give you a good overview of what their about.\n\nI would also like to add that my mom was in Kappa Alpha Theta, and I have several old friends in different sororities at KSU, but I didn\u2019t end up liking their sororities as much. Like everyone else is saying, go with the house that makes YOU happy.",

You should not go into rush thinking \"this house is full of dorks because my sister said so\" or \"this is where the cool girls are because my boyfriend's best friend is dating one,\" or I want to be in this house because I saw a really pretty girl wearing a party shirt this summer. You need to really have no previous opinions, except maybe if you are a legacy. This is also why the rush counselors don't tell you what house they are in. \n\nGuys do rush differently than we do. They are not exposed to any houses unless they want to be. We are introduced to all the houses regardless of any preconceived notions. I could tell you right now which houses were full of snobby girls in 1988 and it may be totally different now, and it can differ between campuses. \n\nJust meet the girls and fit in where you feel comfortable. Don't try to figure out what houses are the \"good\" houses or the \"smart\" houses or the \"sporty\" houses because you will spend 4 years with these people. \n\nMy sister was a Pi Beta Phi at KSU back in 1989, and that was fine, but she transferred to Pi Phi at KU and I swear to god those were the most stuck up, rudest people I have ever met. \n\nI have met girls from my sorority at different houses and have liked them all for the most part. \n\nWhen you are graduated and in the real world, no one will care what house you were in. What will matter is what you learn from being in the Greek system, from table manners to presenting yourself professionally, and making lifelong acquaintances. I'm by no means besties with any of my sorority sisters, but we are still friends and communicate regularly.",

I'm trying to \"put a face to the names\" of every house by getting to know one thing about them (philanthropy, location around campus, if I know anyone in the house etc.). I'm doing it because people say that the days are so packed that when you go to vote all the houses kinda blend together. I promise I won't use the information as good or bad judgement towards your chapter! I want to stay neutral so I can make the best choice",

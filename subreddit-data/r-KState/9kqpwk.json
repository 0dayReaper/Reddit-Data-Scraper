    "postText": "Hey guys! Really excited to be heading up to KSU for the game next week! I've visited KSU briefly but never had the pleasure of attending a game. Can you tell me where your visitors section is? Anything we really should do or see while on campus (or in town)? I saw the recent parking post and have those notes, anything else we need to know?\n\nReally looking forward to seeing your campus and sharing a beer with yall!",

I'd say Manhattan's area to visit is Aggieville, which is just south of campus. That's where the big row of bars is. Call Hall is another place on campus to get good ice cream, I think they are open until 5 on Saturdays.",

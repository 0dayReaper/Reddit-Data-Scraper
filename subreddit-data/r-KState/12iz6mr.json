Do you think I should hold out hope? If not, what are the best single rooms in the Kramer community?",

            "comment": "current student here. Wefald fills really quickly and is honestly not that great of a building. The only advantages it has are the room sizes, semi private bathrooms, and public kitchens. It is the most expensive dorm on campus. The bathroom floors aren\u2019t sloped correctly so the shower floor drains don\u2019t function properly. The walls are sheatrock instead of cinder lock meaning they are paper thin and you hear everything that happens on your floor. Wefald also doesn\u2019t have the sense of community other buildings have. It\u2019s aesthetically nice but has a lot of problems underneath. I personally recommend goodnow which is cheaper and a little bit grody around the edges but it does have a really good sense of community and the ras are really friendly.",

Do you know how fast Goodnow singles fill up? I'm considering joining a CAT community simply for the early room selection, but if its not necessary to get into Goodnow, I'm honestly indifferent.\n\nnote: I'm realizing that \"singles\" might not exist in Goodnow, as they only offer \"double as single\"",

            "comment": "As a disclaimer, my dorm knowledge dates back to 2016, although my brother currently lives in Moore. \n\nThat being said, single rooms are a rare commodity. I lived in Wefald the years it opened, and there were only like 3 single rooms per floor at the time so around 20 total. To answer your question, Wefald does tend to fill up faster and these rooms will likely be the most in demand. Due to the supply and demand gap if you\u2019re not extremely quick to get the room once the period opens up you\u2019ll miss out.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit of information, as I\u2019m a bit biased, but I disliked Wefald the most out of all the other dorms I lived in. It seemed more stuck up, more closed off than the others, and harder to build a sense of community around. I would only recommend Wefald if you\u2019re an underclassman majoring in engineering as that\u2019s the primary demographic of the hall. As a business major and an upperclassman it was difficult to connect with that demographic.\n\nI loved my years in Moore though. I feel like the Derby complex was more my kind of people. More relaxed, kind, down to earth people, and the sauce Moore was the largest hall with the most people I figured my odds were better at making friends there.\n\nI\u2019ve stayed in Moore, Wefald, Goodnow, Boyd (ex girlfriend), Ford (ex girlfriend), and West. Here are my observations from my time there:\n\nMoore: Largest hall, most people, diverse with quite a few international students, more chill and relaxed.\n\nHaymaker: Similar to Moore but at the time seemed a bit rowdier with more athletes, but since 2016 most athletes are in Wefald or off campus.\n\nWest: Kind of the bastard child of the Derby complex, but has since been remodeled. Smaller yet still pretty chill.\n\nFord: Full of sorority girls that don\u2019t talk or interact with anybody outside of their own sorority. Hard to build a community and connect. Would avoid if not in a sorority.\n\nBoyd, Van Zile, Putnam: Grouping these together as they\u2019re fairly similar. Smaller buildings that seemed more friendly and easier to build a community within. Hosted a lot of events, seemed generally happy.\n\nWefald: Athletes, rich kids, engineers, tended to be younger than all the other halls, huge building with 3 wings (men, women, co-ed) so seemed more closed off than a traditional dorm. People interacted but less than you\u2019d expect. A lot of freshmen engineers if you\u2019re looking to network. Building is really nice with good study rooms and close to engineering building.\n\nMarlatt: Seemed fairly chill, some more upper class men engineering majors. Tended to be more chill and down to earth.\n\nGoodnow: Friendly, easy to build a community, the building is the most outdated but I think it\u2019s been somewhat renovated. Probably the most \u201cparty\u201d dorm in the Kramer complex.\n\nHope that helps!",

Having enough space for my computer and monitors, being able to study alone in my room (s/o adhd), my inability to keep my belongings tidy, and most of all, privacy.\n\nAnd unless I have no other option to get a single besides a CAT community, I will avoid joining one at all costs. In large part due to the possibility that I might want to join another group that I feel is a better fit.",

                            "comment": "Ok, so cat communities is a fairly recent thing, but I\u2019m going to give you my brief uneducated opinion on them based on what I observed working at the front desk of one of the halls.\n\nCat communities: I would avoid them. Honestly they seemed kind of stupid. The people involved in them were kind of weird and socially awkward. That includes the people heading them which are referred to as RLA\u2019s. Some people I know were in these communities and thought it was one of the dumbest things ever. It\u2019s a significant amount of free time taken out of your day. A lot of the RLA\u2019s or cat community leaders gave off the vibe as somebody who wasn\u2019t qualified enough to be a RA, but seemed like enough of a kiss ass to warrant some sort of student employment position. There were 4 in my building in 2015 and this is how it turned out:\n\nRLA 1: Kicked out and fired for smoking weed in about 3 months\n\nRLA 2: Gave off weird vibes. Was friendly, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be alone with him. And I\u2019m a guy.\n\nRLA 3: Got fired for sexually harassing one of his community members\n\nRLA 4: was actually cool, but got fired in spring semester for an alcohol related incident\n\nI think after Covid they might have opened up more single rooms so you might be in luck. My brother applied to Moore late and didn\u2019t have any trouble getting a single room. The single room he got was the size of a traditional double room, so I think they just converted some due to dorm residents decreasing.\n\nHope this helps, I think Goodnow is a good fit for you.",

Additionally, my desire to go out-of-state still stands, and while that might change, I want to leave the option open, and the courses required by the CAT community might inhibit my ability to meet transfer requirements in the future.\n\nI think you're correct, as the single rooms in Goodnow are listed as \"Traditional double as single\", and having room for a couch would be lit lmao.\n\nWhat I might do is this:\n\n1. join a CAT community in Goodnow to reserve a spot before selections start\n2. Check for room openings on my selection date\n3. If a room is open, I'll quit the CAT community and select the room I want (the only stipulation on leaving the CAT community is giving up your reserved spot).

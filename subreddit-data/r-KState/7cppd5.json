The \"homophobic graffiti\" could have been written by anyone (and it doesn't mean anything) and the \"white supremacist posters\" were just trolling from 4chan type guys.  The only incidents that you can legitimately point to as being racist are the snapchat pictures of the white rain coats that look like Klan robes (and they do, it was a dumb joke, but they do look like that) and that fat chick who put on blackface a couple of years ago.  That's it.  A couple of dumb and mildly racist jokes from snapchat.  There is no problem with racism at K-State or in Manhattan, there are just people who want to make it look that way so that they can benefit from it.",

I\u2019d imagine a lot of people showed up for a lot of different reasons. I\u2019ve never seen anyone try to give any sort of concrete, quantifiable measure for roughly how many people feel uncomfortable. I\u2019ve seen under a dozen people say they feel uncomfortable in quotes in the collegian and I\u2019ve also seen people - in sort of a racist way - assume those people represent their various minority groups, but no one has offered any evidence that being uncomfortable is a wide spread problem on campus much less how to solve the problem.",

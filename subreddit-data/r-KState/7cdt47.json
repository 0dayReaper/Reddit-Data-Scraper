    "postText": "Hi all, I'm an international student, just completed my undergrad studies in Computer Engineering with GPA 3.2, I have a 308 in GRE and KSU is in my shortlist. I'm thinking of applying for Master's in Computer Science at KSU along with some other universities. I wanted a viewpoint from it's own students rather than some online websites on it's Computer Science program.\nHow good is it's Graduate Computer Science program? ",

            "comment": "I'm only in my first semester of CS graduate studies here, but I already really enjoy it. It's fewer classes and has a tighter focus than my undergrad which makes life a lot simpler.\n\nThe breadth of subjects covered here isn't perfect because the department is still expanding, but it is very comprehensive in several areas including security, high-level software engineering design, and high-performance computing. If you go to [this link](http://catalog.k-state.edu/content.php?filter%5B27%5D=CIS&amp;filter%5B29%5D=&amp;filter%5Bcourse_type%5D=-1&amp;filter%5Bkeyword%5D=&amp;filter%5B32%5D=1&amp;filter%5Bcpage%5D=1&amp;cur_cat_oid=38&amp;expand=&amp;navoid=6608&amp;search_database=Filter&amp;filter%5Bexact_match%5D=1#acalog_template_course_filter) you can see the courses we offer (graduate classes are roughly CIS 690 and above).\n\nOur professors are also very good. You can take a look [here](http://www.cs.ksu.edu/people/faculty/) if you're curious. So far for my grad classes I've had DeLoach, Prabhakar, and Munir, and I rate each of them highly. All of our professors speak English fluently, even if a few of them have somewhat thick accents. We have a strong open-door culture here and I don't know a single professor who wouldn't go out of their way to make time to help a student.\n\nThere's also student life that you should consider. The CS and ECE departments just got a brand new building which opened almost 2 years ago, so our classrooms, study areas, and equipment are all really nice, including our own CS student lounge right down the hall from our lab rooms. Everyone's friendly as hell and there are plenty of clubs and events (we have 2-3 big LAN parties every semester). And, of course, there's Aggieville, the bar district right across from campus.\n\nIf you have any more questions I'll try to answer them as best as I can. Also, where are you from and what are you wanting to study?",

However, I do at least know [William Hsu](http://www.cs.ksu.edu/people/faculty/hsu/), the professor who teaches the AI and big data courses. He is unbelievably knowledgeable when it comes to AI, and if you have the interest (and can keep up with him), he's probably one of the best people you could ever meet in that field.",

How good are the internship opportunities around KSU? and how about on campus jobs?\nI would probably need to support myself financially to some extent during my studies, so it would be good if such opportunities are abundant around college.",

There's a decent amount of local internships, but many of them will be in Kansas City or other places in the state, along with a handful from various locations throughout the country.\n\nAs for on-campus jobs, we have plenty of GTA and GRA spots that you could apply for. I would recommend applying to the Ph.D. program even if you only want to get your Master's, because that opens up a lot more funding opportunities.",

    "postText": "I made a throwaway to protect my identity. I don't want to specify my major, but I'll say it'a social science and I'm a senior. \n\nI had a really rough meeting with my teacher. She had called me rude, flippant, accused me of bigoted opinions, and wouldn't let me defend myself. She knows I am currently recovering from a suicide attempt a month ago.\n\nI had calmed down until I saw my grade. The class is only 500 points total. I received a 100/150 on this, meaning I can\u2019t get an A in the class and I have to miss almost zero points to keep a B. This is a class where I have to get at least a B to advance.  In this class, we\u2019re expected to participate and be vulnerable. But I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared to mess up again. I\u2019m scared to get accused of something that I\u2019m not. I\u2019m scared of having to go through another scathing meeting with my teacher. I\u2019m still a bit emotionally hurt over the whole incident, but normally I\u2019d never be so hurt I was scared. But now I am. \n\nThere\u2019s seven weeks left in the semester. I know I don\u2019t have her next semester and the semester after is my off campus internship. So I don\u2019t know if I should just try my best and hope to God she lightens up, or if I should talk to someone who can help the situation, like the department head or student life. I don\u2019t want to talk to her about it. I know she\u2019ll just double down. And it hurts to be near someone who just seems to hate everything about you, when those things aren\u2019t even true. I also think that if she is that mean to me knowing I\u2019ve tried to commit suicide in the past month, then she probably won\u2019t let me stand to her. I can\u2019t drop the class or switch it.\n\nI feel beaten down, I feel like her power and authority is trying to get me to leave my major, and it\u2019s so overwhelming. I got into my field to make sure people didn\u2019t have to feel this way. I got into my field so others so I can help keep people from suffocated by society\u2019s expectations and restraints. And now I\u2019m feeling the suffocation, but it\u2019s just one person. I don\u2019t know what to do.",

            "comment": "Sorry to hear about your situation.  When you talk about expecting to be vulnerable in class, nobody should be expected to talk about their personal or mental health state, your suicide attempt, or the like.  The teacher is way out of line if that is an expectation.\n\nGiven the requirement to pass the class, it's probably a good idea to continue participating and try to keep a line of communication open with the teacher.  Seems like if the instructor has a low opinion of you from having that said that stuff, it's going to be hard to get her to repair the relationship or get any of those points back this late in the game.  You might as well just continue going, participate as needed, and try to hit that B. If you don't get it, then probably makes sense to see what you can do after.\n\nMeanwhile, are there counseling resources you can talk to at the college, if you're not already?",

            "comment": "I have a few random pieces of advice, so I\u2019m listing them in no particular order: \n\nA: if you haven\u2019t already, go to counseling services and get into individual sessions. As a KState student, you\u2019re entitled to 8 FREE sessions per semester. Use them. These will help your mental health and can be pulled for documentation in the unfortunate case that this has to escalate. \n\nB. If you haven\u2019t already, go to Student Life. They have the capability of asking for academic accommodations from instructors that the instructors then must either follow or fight directly. They may be able to directly help you academically and can again be called upon later for documentation. \n\nC: If the 100/150 is because of bad applications of academic concepts or things you did that didn\u2019t match the rubric or instructions, that grade can\u2019t be challenged and is fair. However, if the points were deducted simply for your views (and the instructor\u2019s feedback on the document makes it clear that is the case), you can challenge the grade based on political discrimination. I wouldn\u2019t do this right now, but keep the assignment, rubric, instructions, and feedback for if you need it later. \n\nD: If those 50 points are all you\u2019re missing, I have good news. In a 500 point class, a 450 is an A, not a B. If you\u2019re missing only those 50 points, you still have another 51 points you could lose before you\u2019d drop to a C. \n\nE: assuming that what the instructor said is unfounded, keep ALL documentation that you have, including emails exchanged. If you have future meetings with this person, record them secretly. Kansas is a one-party consent state, which means you can legally record any conversation you\u2019re a part of. I would just record a video on your phone from your pocket or bag. The video doesn\u2019t matter, only the audio, so just darkness on the screen is fine as long as you can hear what\u2019s being said. Additionally, if the feedback on your assignments indicates discrimination or unfair point docking, KEEP IT. I mean download and save it or take screenshots. If shit goes down, the instructor can go in and erase or change feedback to make you look like a liar. You want separate documentation of what the original said. \n\nF: I would ride out most of the rest of the semester. Keep your head down as much as possible and try to generally give the instructor what she wants. If it becomes impossible for you to pass the class (meaning you miss more than 100 points total) AND you have evidence that those missed points were unfair (e.g., you\u2019re docked points directly for a view you hold rather than not following directions or applying content correctly, you\u2019re not given academic accommodations specified by a campus office, you\u2019re docked points for refusing to share personal information, you have evidence that the instructor graded you more harshly than other students based on a personal issue), then you should do the following steps in order: \n\n1. Email this instructor explaining the issue you think has occurred in a way that is both respectful and professional. For example: \u201cHello Dr. X, I\u2019m in Y class and am emailing about Z assignment. I\u2019m just confused about what I\u2019m missing some of these points for. I thought I followed the instructions and rubric and applied the concepts correctly. Would you mind explaining the following deductions and feedback a little more? I\u2019m also happy to meet if you\u2019d rather do so in person.\u201d Then KEEP whatever response you get or RECORD that meeting. \n2: If the above doesn\u2019t change your score AND you still have evidence the grade is unfair, escalate to the department head or chair. You might also meet with your academic advisor at this stage. Explain in a professional and respectful manner why you think the grade is unfair. Be specific. Explain that you have direct documentation of these issues. Ask for a meeting with the head. RECORD that meeting and KEEP that email exchange. If your evidence is solid, this should solve the issue. \n3. If it doesn\u2019t, and if you still believe your evidence is solid that unfair grading occurred, escalate to the Dean of the college. Do the same process that you did with the department head. \n4. If that doesn\u2019t work, escalate to the Dean of Students. Do the same thing. \n5. If that doesn\u2019t work, talk to the college\u2019s omsbudperson or your family lawyer. If you have exhausted these resources and have clear evidence of unfair treatment based on your politics or refusal to share personal information the school isn\u2019t entitled to, then you have what you need for a successful lawsuit. The issue will almost certainly not get this far. \n\nAll of that is a lot to take in right now, and you probably won\u2019t need most of it, but it\u2019s there just in case. Over the next few weeks, change what you can about how you engage with the instructor and the material. If that means lying and saying what she wants to hear rather than what you really think, then that\u2019s shitty of her, but it might be worth it to just go along. Spend the next 5-6 weeks doing the best you can. Be extra professional and polite in all interactions with her. Keep everything you have as documentation related to this issue, but only use it if you can\u2019t pass the class without doing so AND your evidence of unfair treatment is rock solid. \n\nI hope some of that is helpful!",

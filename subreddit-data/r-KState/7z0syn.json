In 2D it's more design and learning how to make things visually appealing, focusing less on artistic talent. In Drawing you have a in class draw and outside of class drawings due every week or so. I'm pretty sure the majority of my 2D work was in class. Also in Drawing there was a week or two where we were just drawing the ceiling and it kinda frustrating. ",

Like you, I study engineering, and thought taking a drawing class would benefit me. My profession will involve more drawing than that of my classmates, so I am glad I took it, but the twice a week 3 hr sessions + HW was brutal. I spent somewhere between 12-14 hrs during dead week and finals week to get an A in the class. I would highly recommend 2D or 3D design instead. ",

I loved it, one of my favorite classes I've taken on campus, but I draw as a hobby so I knew I'd enjoy it.\n\nIt was basically 3 hours of meditation every couple mornings, and you get to know your classmates well. If you've enjoyed drawing in the past I would recommend it, though there is a considerable time investment. I wouldn't take it along side ochem, fluids, or thermo for instance. The work isn't hard, it's just art, so it takes time.",

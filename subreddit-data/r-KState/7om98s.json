Graduated in May 2003 so I don't know how things work now.\n\nI also managed to graduate with 3 credit hours less than the required 135 at the time because i knew how the K.A.T.S. system worked and after Hightower signed off on my last semester I was golden.  I don't think there's a K.A.T.S. system anymore and I'm sure Hightower is gone as well.",

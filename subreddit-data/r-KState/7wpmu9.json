It\u2019s slated to start in fall 2018, but I\u2019m looking to defer it to fall 2019. \n\nCan anyone tell me more about Kansas State? How\u2019s living in Manhattan? The campus, student body? Is there good food nearby? How\u2019s the campus bus system? Is it easy to get to grocery stores? Do apartments allow pets (I have a cat) and are they close, within walking distance, to campus? \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the bombardment of questions but I appreciate it. ",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently in undergrad so I can\u2019t speak much about the grad school, but I personally love it. Honestly, I was kind of bummed to come here originally because my #1 school was too expensive, but I\u2019m actually super glad I came here instead of going to Cornell. \n\nAs for the campus and student life, everyone is super nice and there are a ton of concerts, movies, events, shows, etc... that come and are a ton of fun. McCain (our big auditorium) brings pretty big and famous shows every year (broadway shows like Kinky Boots, Mamma Mia, and Dirty Dancing all came, so did the Russian National Ballet and Kenny G) and students get half off ticket prices for those showsThe campus itself is pretty compact and I can easily get from the far North building to the far South one in 10-15 minutes. Because of this, however, the bussing system isn\u2019t all that great in my experience. It\u2019s nice getting to and from campus, but it won\u2019t be any use aside from that. That being said, I walk to campus so I don\u2019t know if it has improved any since last year \n\nFor food, there are 4-5 grocery stores within 5 minutes of campus. As for restaurants, the only thing super unique to Manhattan are some really good breakfast places and diners (the Chef, Early Edition, Bobs Diner). Aggieville has a lot of fun sports bars and grills, but it gets super crowded on weekends so I usually avoid it. There are some really good Asian places (Bi Bim Bop) too. The rest are your usual chains, but there\u2019s a lot of variety.\n\nAs for housing, my apartment is about 3 blocks away from campus and allows most pets. There are \u201con campus\u201d (barely off campus) apartments that have rooms specifically for grad students called the Jardine Apartments that are pretty nice and you can walk to campus in like 2 minutes. As for pets, I don\u2019t really know if Jardine allows them, but I would imagine so since they\u2019re so popular. I\u2019d be happy to answer any other questions!",

I love where I go to school now for my MA, and I was accepted into their PhD program but it does seem like K-State will be a better fit for me. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just worried because it would be 9 hours away from home. I\u2019m from Indianapolis, IN so committing and dealing with being so far away from home is the one kind of daunting thing. \n\nDoes the university offer welcome weekends at all for admitted or prospective students?",

I'm from Minnesota (about 8 hr drive) and haven't felt like it was too far away at all.  \n\nOne important thing to note is that about 90% of the students are in-state.  So as an out-of-state-er, it is really noticeable.  Most of the out of state students are from the Midwest  (mainly Missouri, Colorado, Nebraska, Minnesota, etc) so you'll fit in just fine.  Out of the in state students, a good chunk are from Kansas city area.  As a result, the culture is pretty similar to other Midwestern areas and most people are really nice and approachable.  There's also a good amount of students from western Kansas who are often from small rural towns.  These have been some of the nicest and down to earth people I've met.  All in all, I can guess it'll be different from your current school, but I've really enjoyed my time here and the perspectives it's given me.\n\nAs for Manhattan, it's basically by itself and not too close to any other major areas (Topeka is 45 minutes away, KC just under 2 hrs).  That said, it definitely has anything you'd need and just enough variety. ",

I'm from the Chicago 'burbs so I was pretty far from home too (but I came here after masters at University of Oklahoma so I was used to that. K-State is much friendlier IMO).\n\nThere is an airport here with direct flights to O'Hare, which may get you home a bit quicker than driving.\n\nThere is a bus route in town that's pretty new. It's called ATA bus if you want to look into it. As a grad student I lived a bit more than a mile from my departments building so I walked quite often. Much better than stressing over parking on campus!\n\nBeing a grad student here is a unique experience. I felt that a lot of Manhattan was geared toward undergrads or families. Now would be a good time to admit I'm not into sports. If you are then ignore me, plenty to do for you!\n\nIf you like going to bars, Auntie May's felt like a comfy place to hang out as a grad student. There are plenty of bars to choose from, though.\n\n\n\n",

There are lots of lower price places to stay, off campus. Pets, no clue where they are allowed. \n\nThere are enough places to eat, nothing too crazy, it caters well to the lower income demographic college students are often in.",

But with that said, as you can see on the schedule linked above the buses only go to each stop once an hour and only run during the day, so it's pretty limiting. I would find it a big pain in the ass to live in this town without a car, personally.\n\nAnd plenty of apartments allow pets (I have a dog), they just often charge $25-50 per month for pet rent and will likely have an additional deposit. There's living places directly across the street from campus, or a ten minute drive away. Just depends what you want and what's available.",

I was a actually a history major and know a little bit about the dept. \n\nFirst and foremost, I'm not sure what the research facilities are going to be like for high level research. Hale Library is great and they have some pretty unique and cool collections and archives, but you may find yourself having to make the trek to Lawrence to get to some of their collections and archives. It was all and everything I needed as an undergrad, but for PhD work, I feel I've had more opportunities elsewhere.\n\nAs far as the town, definitely see if you can visit Manhattan if you can. It's a great little college town and I think it was one of the best places I could have spent my undergrad years. Everything is compact and the city is flat enough that you can really bike everywhere. The people are also just super friendly.\n\nFinally, I don't know how many of the faculty from 06-09 are still there, but I really loved the history department. Dr. Linder was probably the best professor and teacher I had in either undergrad or graduate school. ",

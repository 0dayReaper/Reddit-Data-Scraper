    "postText": "Hello, I found out a few days ago that my roommate is bailing on me and going to Ku instead so I need to find a place to live by January- june or even until August.\n \nPreferences:\nPrivate room\nPrivate bath ( if possible )\n2 rooms would be awesome but I can deal with more \n300-450 $ monthly payments &lt;400 with utilities\nSomewhat close to campus. \nNon tobacco smokers\nCute kitties/ low maintenance pets are welcomed.\n\n\nIf need be we can find a place together but if you're interested and already have an apartment that would be great. \nOh also 21/ male. I'll be an environmental architecture student by next august. thanks :)\n\n\nEDIT: if anyone is curious to what I look like I posted am album today to r/backpacking it has a picture of me in there. https://www.reddit.com/r/WildernessBackpacking/comments/7dn3li/upper_cataract_lake_trail_co_adventure/",

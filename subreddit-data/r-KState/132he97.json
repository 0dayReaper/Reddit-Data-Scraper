Over time you figure out what is the most efficient way for YOU to work on homework/projects or study for tests/quizzes.\n\nThe biggest thing I have noticed is that if you are always 100% focusing on school your mental health takes a hit. Being and to go out with some friends and party or just chill allows me to be more effective when I am actually working on schoolwork instead of just stressing all the time.",

Immediately do all your homework and studying. Get it over so that your evening is free. \n\nWhen your work load is such that you need more than the afternoon to finish, you need to find study groups with people you enjoy. Then it will double dip as school and social time.",

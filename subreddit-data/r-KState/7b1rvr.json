    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m an incoming student and I was wondering if anybody has pictures of the wefald and west dorms bathrooms? I\u2019m trying to compare the two and I wanted to see if anybody had pictures of them. Or if there are any pictures online so I can see them? Trying to see how nice they are and make sure they aren\u2019t disgusting. I am unable to visit the campus, so that would be really helpful. Thank you. ",

A weekend of college students, especially since it\u2019s mostly freshman, can make a bathroom nasty in a hurry. My wing (boys) had some extremely gross weekends. It would often look like a tornado had gone through by Monday morning. Someone puked in a sink on a Friday evening and it sat there all weekend. Someone shit in a shower once (that was a weekday though). There is definitely going to be sex happening in the showers (always wear sandals when showering in any dorm). It\u2019s going to get nasty from drunks at some point so be prepared.\n\nMy dorm was Moore so it might not be relevant, but after opening the door there was a wall right in front of you. On the right side were four stalls and four sinks, on the left side were four sinks and four normal showers and one handicap shower/bath (not sure on the handicap one, don\u2019t think anyone ever used it). The showers had two curtains. You step in and the first area had a little bench to put your shit on and hang your towel and then you would pass the next curtain into the actual shower. The actual shower area is just a square so it was fairly small. The showers were pretty good quality though. With guys waiting for a shower was rarely ever an issue in the morning. I never had to wait more than a couple minutes. We had an old fairly crappy radio in there, which was pretty nice. Having loud music kind of help keep things more private I guess. I believe every bathroom in Moore was the same layout.",

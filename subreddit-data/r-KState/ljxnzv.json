    "postText": "Hi everyone! **Hearts for the Homeless International** is a student-led nonprofit organization that provides free blood-pressure screening opportunities and heart health education to homeless populations around the United States and globally. We are a team of undergraduate students, medical students, PhD students, medical doctors, and other professionals who are invested in improving the well-being of homeless communities around the world- including yours. H4H was originally founded by students at the University of Central Florida and has since grown into an international organization with over 15 chapters across the United States, Brazil, and India. With your passion, we aim to work with you to help you positively impact your homeless community. Together, we can better fulfill our goal of improving the condition of humanity!\n\nWe are **interested in working with student leaders** who want to innovate, to serve, and to enact change. For student leaders who are interested, all we ask is for your time, leadership, and compassion. We will take care of the rest. The lives you will change, the friends you will make, and the experiences you will gain will be invaluable.\n\nThe work of our students has helped so many, and for this reason, it has been recognized by the US Congress, the Brazilian government, President Clinton, educational and medical institutions, and other non-profit institutions as well. Some of our other significant achievements include leading an effort to rescue the homeless in multiple cities from hurricanes, partnering with Shark Tank\u2019s Bombas Socks, as well as being published by [Forbes Magazine](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesnonprofitcouncil/2017/11/06/how-young-leaders-are-strengthening-community-responses-to-disasters/#77391a361850).\n\nWe want to be able to help serve the struggling homeless community in Manhattan and cities nearby. According to the most recent counts, Manhattan has hundreds of people experiencing homelessness every day. As the Hearts for the Homeless Manhattan President, you will positively impact your community with a great international team supporting your drive to help others and implementing any great ideas you suggest.\n\n**Are you interested in being a H4H leader that makes a difference in your community?** Use our response sheet, and let us know!

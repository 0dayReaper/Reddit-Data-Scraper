    "postText": "Hello! I'm an incoming international graduate student at K-State (will be starting this Fall), and I'm currently looking for a place to live!\n\nMy advisor recommended Jardine as it is easier to rent there as an international student, at least for the first year.\n\nI'm interested in renting a 1-bedroom renovated apartment, and would like an honest opinion of what it's like living there.\n\nSome questions I have:\n\n\\- Does the window air conditioner work well enough during the summer?/ Is heating good enough for the harsh winters?\n\n\\- Have you ever had a problem with infestations (in particular, roaches)?\n\n\\- How much do you pay for electricity each month (on average)?\n\n\\- Can you terminate the contract at the end of Fall semester without major penalties? Or do they make you pay 50% -100% of the Spring semester rate as damages for breach of contract.\n\nI appreciate any input you can provide! Looking forward to joining the K-State community this Fall.",

Never had a problem with bugs or anything like that. Don\u2019t remember what I paid for in utilities. There were no issues or fees for breaking lease at after 6 months.",

            "comment": "I've been out of college for over 10 years now, so my experience isn't exactly fresh, but I lived in one of the newer Jardine buildings. I remember talking to some friends of my parents who went to K-State back in the day before those Jardine apartments were renovated and they mentioned how they had pest problems and everything, so your concern is valid!\n\nThankfully, I've heard nothing but good things about the renovations. I lived in Jardine for 3 years, and loved it. Even if the apartment isn't perfect, the landscaping, convenience store, restaurant, etc are all excellent and super convenient. But really, I had zero complaints the whole time I was there. \ud83d\udc4c\n\nEdit: For information on average bills and termination fees, I'd contact their office. I'm sure they'd be happy to fill you in.",

            "comment": "- The window AC cools the living room pretty well, but it doesn't reach the bedroom. Make sure to buy fans! Heating is managed by the building itself, so it's always sufficient.\n\n- No problems with infestation. Nice and clean.\n\n- Electricity bill was 80 bucks a month in the summer.\n\n- Contract's a little bit tricky, pretty sure there's a renewal date. Just talk with Jardine staff, they'll have lots of advice to help you.\n\nIt's a nice place! Everything's walkable, and there's a fancy-ish restaurant on-site. You'll love it.",

Cranked it up, turned on fans, and lived, but the window unit is in the living room and bedrooms are on the other side of the apartment. \n\nNo problem with bugs or anything like that. The kitchen was extremely small. Small fridge, sink, 3 foot wide counter and small oven (didn't even fit a full baking sheet). \n\nOverall, it was well worth the price and convenience, but I'm also very happy to be out of it.",

Kitchen is very small and there is no dishwasher, no storage space. You can get better 2bhk apartments off campus for 800-900$. It's slightly expensive but will be way better than Jardine.",

Heating was great, we got an extra fan because we personally like it colder and you can terminate your lease at the end of semester if you signed a semester long lease. \n\nIt\u2019s got a great location between stadium and the rest of campus, a restaurant on site, and decent laundry. Some machines don\u2019t clean as well as others but that is to be expected in a communal space. Overall I\u2019ve had a fairly good experience with Jardine in the time I\u2019ve been here!",

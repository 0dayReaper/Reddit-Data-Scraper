    "postText": "My girlfriend and I are coming up to Manhattan for our first game this Saturday and couldn't be more excited.\n\nI was hoping you guys could provide some input on the parking situation. We got our tickets second hand so do not have a parking pass. It looks like GA parking in lot 9 and Rec GA is pretty limited so I wanted to see how early you think we should arrive or if you have any other recommendations.\n\nThanks!",

There are a few churches along Kimball Ave. that offer parking for $20 or less. \n\nI don\u2019t recommend parking on the streets in the neighborhoods. There are signs posted that specify no parking on game day. If people call you in you could be towed.",

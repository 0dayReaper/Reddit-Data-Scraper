I haven't had a chance to visit yet, but plan on doing so sometime in May. Been doing some googling and some aerial view on maps but I doubt it is gonna do the place justice. I appreciate your time.

The campus is pretty, its a bit hilly from what I remember so be prepared for that! I can't offer much on specifics, but I think you'll enjoy it! ",

There is great access to many parks within, and the Konza Prairie Natural Area just outside, the city. The area is largely open prairie with oak forests. The campus is gorgeous but you can see that on Instagram or Google. There are two entertainment districts in Manhattan. Aggieville is the most proximate to campus, it caters more to students, has lots of bars and a few shops worth visiting. Downtown is more expensive, but caters more to young professionals and other adults. The mall sucks, but has a nice new theatre. If you want live entertainment, Auntie Mae's in Aggieville routinely has live bands and comedy. The university's theater department holds plays in the Purple Mask and lots of great national and international acts come through McCain auditorium. Union Program Council also holds several events each year that vary in quality but are occasionally great. There is a great art museum on campus, Mariana Kistler Beach. The region can be very conservative, but there are lots of liberals in and around the university. It's not hard to find a community.\n\nLet us know if you're looking for something specific.",

            "comment": "I read through your responses and questions, I think I can be of help. I grew up in Manhattan (MHK) and went to KState before moving to Kansas City for medical school and now residency. MHK is unique in that it has a small town feel without feeling too small. It offers a great bar and food scene, passionate sporting events, natural beauty and recreation, national level entertainment and premier educational facilities. The recreation complex is massive and newly renovated, most of campus has been revamped in the last 15 years, and the library is the center point and pride of campus. \n\nFor fun there is a regional brewer in Tallgrass and new winery estate Liquid Art that are great to visit. McCain and UPC bring in music and theater from around the country and local bars host local talent. To be fair the music scene in MHK has much to be desired, but Lawrence KS is abit over an hour away on I70 and is known for their robust music scene. Even if you don't like sports you should go to a K-State football game to experience the tailgaiting and gameday atmosphere, among the best in all of college football. The Konza prairie is a beautiful hiking destination and tuttle creek and milford lake are 2 nearby lakes for water sports. \n\nTransportation is lacking like most midwest towns, no real bus or metro system, but it has regional airport that is expanding with daily flights to major hub cities. Uber and lyft have strong markets due to the young population. \n\nAs far as the culture of the town, it's clearly not the east coast, but it is nowhere close to typical small town Kansas. Granted the town and campus are not profoundly diverse as the ethnic makeup is mostly a reflection of the region, there is a sizeable international community and an overall moderate political climate. I feel that were I live now in KC is more conservative than MHK is, the city council and university are definitely more liberal than the surrounding area. It is not known to be a liberal bastion of the state like Lawrence but is certainly not a conservative stronghold (Trump beat Hillary by 800 votes out of 33k+ registered voters in the county... only 1 county in KS went blue). \n\nMHK is overall a great place to live, and routinely is ranked as a top 10 college town in America. US News and Princeton review routinely rank KSU a top school for student well-being. The town has grown fast the past 2 decades and is expected to double in size in the next 20 years due to key private and governmental contracts. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the little apple when you visit!\n\n",

If you're coming from a larger city and expecting all of the amenities found therein you'll be disappointed. Manhattan, is after all, a small midwest college town. Personally, I loved living there once I got over the oppressive summer heat. You're never more than 20 min away from anything. If you get a place in the right part of town, you won't need a car because a bike is more than sufficient. People are incredibly friendly (especially if you come from the east coast) which is nice. The city itself is pretty damn small,but it has one of most things that you'd want.\n\nWhat are you thinking about studying? ",

I am going there with my PI from a lab I work in at UMass Amherst, studying Microbiology while researching bioremediation and microbial ecology.",

Be prepared for what feel like super invasive questions from people you barely know. At first, I found this offsetting and would get irritated, but I grew to love how everyone was so kind and welcoming. \n\nThe other important thing to know about KSU is that the entire town of Mahattan exists because of the University and nearby Ft. Riley. Summers in Manhattan are extremely hot and boring. Not much happens in town once all of the students leave. With that said, it's pretty cool to see the other side of the town sans undergrads. It's much quieter. \n\nI live in Southern CA now and still try to visit every few years. It's a wonderful little town. ",

            "comment": "The Fridge has a great selection and good prices and is probably the best overall liquor store. They have an awesome beer, wine, and liquor selection, the prices are competitive if not on the low side, and every once in a while you can find a gem on sale. \n\nThe Library is where I go the most because it's close to my house and it has a great beer selection. It is usually a little pricier though, but if you tell then you have a Library card you can get a small discount. Also the liquor and wine selection is fairly average.\n\nI also stop at 5th Street Liquor across the street from the Post Office pretty often because it's on my way home from work and has good prices. Not the biggest selection to choose from but not bad for the size of the store.\n\nThe most consistently cheap beer in town though is hands down Classics Beer and Liquor off of Seth Childs near RCPD and Home Depot. They almost always have the lowest prices on beer and wine in town, and usually the cheapest liquor too. The beer and liquor selections is pretty average. Not a ton of craft beers, but they probably have the best wine selection in town. It's probably the best place to get everything you need for a weekend long shit show all in one place and at a good price.",

    "postText": "Love college football? Ever wish you could step into your favorite team\u2019s shoes?\u00a0\n\nLook no further than the NZCFL, an 120-team college football simulation league, where many teams, including Kansas St, are open! Our league offers a unique combination of a realistic coaching and recruiting experience, with the flexibility that allows you to put in as much or as little time as you wish! Our recruiting system, designed to emulate the real-life football recruiting process and comprised of three sections, allows you to sign a program-changing class in just one cycle. If you\u2019re looking for that more casual experience, it\u2019s easy to get the process knocked out in one sitting, but you\u2019ll still be able to go even farther if you\u2019re able to put the time in. That\u2019s what makes this league such a great experience - you\u2019re in control. You have the ability to build a legacy and leave a lasting impact on these teams.\n\nAs someone who's been in the league for nearly two IRL years, it really is a great community. Everyone is willing to lend a hand to a newbie, the mods put a ton of time into running things smoothly, and there's plenty of casual activities and banter to keep things interesting.\u00a0\n\nCome join us by claiming a team in the Reddit reservation thread at r/NZCFL and joining the server![ https://discord.gg/vJnYPFd](https://discord.gg/vJnYPFd) If you have any questions, DM me, or join the server and ask in \u2060newcomers. We'll be happy to help.",

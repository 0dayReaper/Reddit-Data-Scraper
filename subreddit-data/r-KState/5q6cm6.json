Facilities and maintenance have been told to remove them so if anyone else sees any, remove and dispose of them. \n\nLet's try to keep this campus as comfortable and pleasant as we can. There's a lot of disagreement going on in the country right now, but we don't need to let that kind of stuff divide us anymore.",

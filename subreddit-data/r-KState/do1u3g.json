    "postText": "Hi there! We the team at[ www.ensu.com](https://www.ensu.com/), are building an app related to music listening and emotions. The premise is that if you listen to Spotify, we can help you understand how your music listening correlates to mood / emotion states (specific for you), as well as giving you new insights around patterns in your moods and emotions over time.\n\nWe're a team of mental health passionate people who are all recently out of college, and we're looking to get input from Kstate students (we're designing the app specifically for college students) on the concept and the app. We're still in beta so would appreciate y'all signingup and giving us feedback!\n\nIf you're interested, please go to[ www.ensu.com](https://www.ensu.com/) and sign up! Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)",

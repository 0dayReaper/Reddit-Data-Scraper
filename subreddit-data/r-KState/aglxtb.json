He probably would have won it, but you can blame it on the decision of the coaches to stick with it and not make the change sooner.\n\nMy position on this isn't that Delton is better. Hell if you could fuse both QB's as 1, we would get a good QB. My position is I don't like Thompson as a QB, he's incompetent in the position. He has yet to show improvement game to game that tells me, OK he's getting better. \n\nI have no idea why the both of you that are arguing with me on things that are opinionated based. He's a terrible QB, but maybe, just maybe with this new coaching staff he will be 100% better than last year.",

Thompson comes in and rallies the troops for a comeback that almost happened. In games where Skylar was the only QB to play, we went 2-3 with our three losses being to Baylor (scored 34), OU (went on to CFP Semifinal), and Iowa State (scored 38).  All of those losses were on our defense. He is a leader and allows our offense to be versatile with effective passing and rushing.",

Is he better than Delton? In my opinion only when it comes to throwing the ball, but Delton is the better runner and I would say half of his passes were pretty accurate.\n\nThe whole offense has been a complete disappointment IMO. The talent isn't there and I fault the coaching staffs inability of recruiting quality players. It was bad when Snyder for the first time threw his players under the bus when he said something along the lines to: \"I can't coach anyone who can't grow, x amount and can be faster.\"\n\nThompson just lacks the intuitiveness that most competent QB's have. I want to be wrong about this and this new coaching staff transforms him into a quality QB, but he's just inexperienced and not talented/athletic enough.",

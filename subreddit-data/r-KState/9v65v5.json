I've gotten pretty used to clicking on the username of right-wing posters and doing a quick ctrl+f search for the subreddit name.  Makes it easy to tell who is a regular poster who holds conservative views and who's a brigadier coming from outside to stir up shit, almost always from t_d.  This sort of behavior is against reddit's site rules and they've banned numerous subreddits for it, but t_d is left to do it's thing because.....who knows?  Reddit is scared of them?  Scared of the President?  Agrees with them?",

            "comment": "If you haven\u2019t heard, K-State has already implemented a $70/credit hour charge to online courses + an additional online fee for each individual college. These charges are added to any course that was originally in person and has now transitioned to online. This purpose of this petition is to (hopefully) convince K-State to remove those additional charges. Please sign and share it with anybody you know, it doesn\u2019t have to be just K-Staters. Thank you!",

                            "comment": "I\u2019m not sure the announcement was clear about the fee being added on top of regular tuition. But if I check my KSIS, my tuition charge is correct for 15 hours at the regular tuition rate, and then I have an entirely separate charge listed as \u201cCollege of A&amp;S Online Fee\u201d that is $630 (so 9 hours, and that is correct bc 3 of my A&amp;S courses have just transferred online after originally being in person). So it is most definitely being tacked on as an extra added fee, which I would understand had I originally signed up for these courses online. But shifting them from in-person to online and NOW charging extra fees feels a bit scummy (especially since professors are receiving reduced salaries this year, so that money is not going to them). I get that the University is facing financial struggles, but imo the weight of that entire burden should not be put on the students.\n\nRealistically, will this petition convince the admin to change their decision? Probably not. And I acknowledge that it is most definitely safer for the courses to be shifted online due to COVID. But what doesn\u2019t make sense to me is the purpose of these charges. They\u2019re not going to professors. They don\u2019t need to go towards facilities since courses will be conducted via Zoom/Canvas (software that is already paid for and licensed). So where is this money going?",

Ok, I saw your comment later on and talked to a colleague and it is vague in the announcement. \n\nThe university is actually losing money by reducing the fees. Online does cost more beyond Zoom and Canvas; for one, asynchronous lectures have to be hosted via mediasite (through Canvas). They also have to adjust for more people accessing online resources than predicted (increased load on servers). We have around 25,000 students. Putting all of them online costs a lot.\n\nI get that it sucks. I work in student affairs and see a lot of students' difficulties due to high tuition and fees. There are frustrating campus fees (charging grad students doing research hours a course enhancement fee?) But I do not see this is as a for-profit gesture. Why not contact the provost's office and ask about the $70/hour fee? It's good to have questions, but assuming one already has the answers isn't the next step.",

You did mention some valid points that I completely overlooked (server load, mediasite hosting, the online fee being reduced). I know the University of Kansas has been utilizing YouTube with private URLs for lecture videos - that could potentially be a cheaper alternative to Mediasite (but to be honest, I\u2019m not entirely sure how that works internally).\n\nI plan on reaching out to the provost\u2019s office, so thank you for that advice. More transparency would be much appreciated.\n\nFrom our perspective as students, it does feel like we\u2019re being punished, in a way, for something that is completely out of our control (well, for the most part, I can\u2019t vouch for others practicing/not practicing social distancing habits). I\u2019m also personally in a tough situation because I\u2019m in my last two semesters, so I am unable to switch out of the online courses for in-person courses since I\u2019m nearly finished with my degree and need every credit that I\u2019m enrolled in. \n\nI also acknowledge that the University needs to stay afloat, and tough decisions like this one have to be made. There\u2019s not going to be a solution that pleases everyone, and we might just have to accept that, unfortunately.",

We also pay the normal tuition rate for these courses, about $340/credit hour. And then, on top of that rate, we are also being charged an extra $70/hour, so nearly $410/credit hour for courses that were supposed to be in person when we enrolled, but have now transitioned online. For me, this has the added cost of $630 because I had 3 courses transition to online. I\u2019ve seen other students with additional fees of &gt; $1000 depending on the individual college (engineering, arts and sci., etc.).",

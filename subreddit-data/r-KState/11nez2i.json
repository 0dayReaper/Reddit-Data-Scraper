What types of things are there to do? And if there's anyone in plant pathology or a related major, what do you think of the program?\nThanks!",

The university is nice (Aggieville is a mess right now with construction). \n\nAgriculture rules, so expect many pickup trucks. There is an Army Base 30 miles away so young military like to come out and mingle with the college crowd.",

The university is beautiful, friendly, and, in some spaces, badly in need of upgrades. I\u2019ve never been to OU but I imagine they\u2019re comparable. I went to UD for my Masters and there was very little culture shift besides plastic bags for goods (like at a store) is sometimes called a sack.",

Aggieville and the downtown area (on Poyntz) have bars, shops, and restaurants. The latter is a lot nicer, the former is where the students congregate. The town is very bike-able, and there\u2019s nice hiking options with the Konza and Tallgrass prairies.",

            "comment": "Agree with the previous two. I attended KSU 10 years ago (gag) and just moved back. Manhattan has grown up a LOT in the last decade. It's very Midwest, most people are friendly, it's right-leaning with a fair amount of diversity (at least as far as the university goes). Aggieville (bar district) is *supposed* to be construction free by summer, and the town population drops almost in half during the summer so you won't have crowds. But there is still plenty of fun and adventure to be found, you just have to find it!\n\nCongrats on the internship!",

As a college town, most people have their own social circles revolving around school or work. It's definitely harder to meet people if you don't have that built-in network.\n\nAnd I'm from another Midwestern State closer to your own before moving out here. I'd say it's similar. Even with 50,000 people, Manhattan definitely still has small town vibes. There is still something for everyone here though. It just takes a little more time to find it. Good luck!",

    "postText": "Incoming freshman here with a question. \n\nSo my girlfriend is going to another college a few hours away, meaning we will hardly ever see each other, and we are trying to figure out how she can visit here overnight. We want for her to be able to stay in my dorm room with me on an air mattress, that way she doesn\u2019t have to get a hotel room or drive all the way back to where she lives. Basically, it would save a lot of money for her and also allow us to have more time together since she could stay for the next day. \n\nThe problem is, I can\u2019t find any information on if visitors are allowed to stay the night in dorms, so I was wondering what the procedure for that was? Any information helps. Thanks!",

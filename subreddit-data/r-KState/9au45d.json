That\u2019s a pretty long list if you\u2019re just asking about between me and my opponent, but here are a few of my bigger ideas:\n\n* Adding a high-income earner tax bracket\n   * The top 1% of Kansans make over $350k/year, yet are in the same bracket as Kansans who make $60k/year\n* Passing common-sense gun legislation, including: \n   * Red-flag laws;\n   * Universal background checks; and\n   * Banning guns on college campuses.\n* Ensuring equality for all Kansans, including such measures as:\n   * Expanding existing anti-discrimination laws to allow any Kansas resident who is fired, kicked out of their home, or denied other rights for being a member of the LGBTQ+ community to fight back with litigation;\n   * Overturning the discriminatory adoption bill my opponent helped pass; and\n   * Expanding the Equal Pay Act, as done in Washington ([**https://www.fisherphillips.com/resources-alerts-equal-pay-for-equal-work-washington-updates**](https://www.fisherphillips.com/resources-alerts-equal-pay-for-equal-work-washington-updates))\n* Fully funding education\n   * That includes adding universal pre-K and restoring state funding to K-12 and higher education\n* As for my campaign, I\u2019m rejecting all PAC money. That way, when elected, I will be beholden only to my constituents, and not the toxic special interest, corporate money that played such a major role in landing us where we are today.\n   * On that note, if you have any policy priorities or concerns you want taken to the capitol, I\u2019m all ears. You can reach me anytime on my [website ](https://www.vandykeforkansas.com)or my [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/vandykeforkansas).",

I share that goal as one of my main platforms -- keeping the taxes that affect us lower- and middle-class Kansans flat, rather than increasing them again to bail out the failed Brownback tax experiments.\n\nI intend to make up our revenue shortfalls by adding a high-income earner tax bracket for the top earning 1% of our state, as well as increase taxes on larger corporations. That money would go toward things regular Kansans need, such as public and higher education and healthcare.\n\nI also want to implement a policy targeting corporations, like Walmart, that pay their CEOs more than 20x what they pay their average employees and have employees on public assistance. Under this policy, such companies would be required to reimburse the state for the public assistance used by their employees.",

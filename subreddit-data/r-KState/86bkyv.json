            "comment": "There's a lot of big bonus money on the line for K-State head basketball coach Bruce Weber and Kansas head coach Bill Self.\n\nAs the Wildcats and Jayhawks continue in the NCAA Tournament, both coaches have opportunities to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars in addition to their million-dollar salaries.\n\nWeber already earned an additional 16 percent bonus to his $2.15 million salary since K-State made it into the Sweet 16, according to his contract. That's a $344,000 bonus.\n\nADVERTISING\n\ninRead invented by Teads\nBut he could still earn more.\n\n\nIf the team beats Kentucky on Thursday during the regional semifinals in Atlanta, Weber would earn a 20 percent bonus \u2014 an additional $430,000 \u2014 for making it to the Elite Eight. And if K-State makes it to the Final Four, he'd earn another $516,000.\n\nIf the Wildcats were to win the national championship, Weber would receive a $688,000 bonus.\n\nThose bonus percentages are not cumulative, his contract states.\n\nWhile Weber can earn a higher bonus at each step of the tournament, Self doesn't earn a NCAA Tournament bonus unless the Jayhawks make the Final Four, according to his contract.\n\nIf KU reaches the Final Four, Self will receive a $150,000 bonus. And if the Jayhawks win the NCAA Tournament, he will receive an additional $200,000.\n\nSelf also earned $75,000 for winning both the Big 12 regular season and tournament championships.\n\nWichita State was the only NCAA Tournament team from the Sunflower State that did not make it to the Sweet 16. Regardless, head coach Gregg Marshall received an additional $36,000 to his $3 million salary for playing a tournament game, according to his contract.\n\nHe would have continued to receive a $36,000 \"performance incentive\" for each game the Shockers played in the NCAA Tournament, in addition to a $60,000 bonus if the team had made it to the Sweet 16.",

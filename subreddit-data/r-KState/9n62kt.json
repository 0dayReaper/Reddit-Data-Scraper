    "postText": "Ok so here is the situation, My bike was stolen a couple days ago from my apartment complex on Manhattan Ave. and it was all locked up n' that good stuff so someone must have cut my lock and taken it. I was wondering if anyone had any kind of past experiences or what not on where it could be or who could have possibly taken it, I have checked all the pawn shops in town and most of the bike shops, I have heard a few rumors of some bike shop named kelby's Bike Shop where the guy sells stolen bikes for super cheap but thats all i have heard (not sure where it is if it exists in the first place) \n\nIf you could help out that would be great!!!\n\nThanks yall!!!",

He would stalk bikes for weeks, find there regular schedule, search them on the internet, find how much they are worth, etc. Once he deemed the conditions right for theft, he steal it with some bolt cutters, then sell the bike on Craigslist in a place that was several hours away. Hope this helps, good luck",

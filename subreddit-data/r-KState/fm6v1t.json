It makes it seem like Rodriguez represents the whole state when he's just the chairman of this county. Looking around on Twitter to see responses to this article, I've seen people (mainly from other states like California) saying it's Kansans' fault for voting him in, when in fact in 2016 he went unopposed. The response I've seen on Facebook groups and subreddits from people who live here is unanimously condemning his statements.\n\nThose people out of our state don't care how progressive we are. They'll point at 5 Westboro Baptists as if we're all like that, ignoring 200 students from MHS who counter-protested them with rainbow flags and signs of love.",

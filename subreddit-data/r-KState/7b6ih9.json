    "postText": "I am in search for a subleasor for my apartment starting January 2018.\nI can tell you a little bit about the apartment complex.  The name is University Crossing apartments located at 2215 College Ave. Manhattan, Kansas 66502.  It\u2019s located just a walking distance away from the football stadium. My current rent rate is 420/mo and my lease ends on July 31st 2018.  The only utilities that you will be responsible for is electricity and water and the average for both is about 30 per month.  The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable and wireless internet.  Another great thing about subleasing is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my subleasor and you can move into any apartment within the complex.\nIf you are interested, please contact me at 785-473-8636.  If you would like to set up a tour or have any additional questions you can contact the leasing manager at785-539-0500.\nAmenities included:\n\u2022\t24-hour Fitness Center\n\u2022\t24-hour Computer Lab with FREE Printing \n\u2022\tWasher &amp; Dryer in each unit\n\u2022\tFree Tanning\n\u2022\tBasketball Court\n\u2022\tTennis Court\n\u2022\tOutdoor, in-ground Pool\n\u2022\tClubhouse including Pool Table and TV (cable provided)\n\u2022\tPatio Area with Barbecue Grill\n\u2022\tOn-Site Management &amp; Maintenance\n\u2022\tIndividual Leasing\n\u2022\tFully Furnished Apartments\n\u2022\tOn-Site Parking\n\u2022\tRoommate Matching Service\n\u2022\tFree Shuttle Service to Kansas State University\n\u2022\tFree Coffee Bar located in the Leasing Office\nMichael Hodge \u2013 Leasing Manager\nmhodge@clsliving.com \n785-539-0500\n\nThe fees that are associated with subleasing are below\u2026 but I am willing to cover most if not all of the costs.\n \n$200.00 subleasor fee (paid for by lease holder)\n$180.00 subleasor application fee (paid for by person subletting)\n$100.00 deposit (paid for by person subletting IF the lease holder has a deposit of any amount on file)\n",

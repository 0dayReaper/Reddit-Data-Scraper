    "postText": "Hello, I am a Junior in High School and I was planning on majoring as a professional pilot, which means KState Polytechnic for me. However, the entire reason I wanted to go to KState in the first place was to join the band, and now I fear that I will not be able to join the band if I am all the way in Salina. Are there any other students that have made it work as a student at KState Polytechnic and also a member of the band? I want at least one year of experience in the band, I feel like it'd be an amazing experience and don't want to miss out on it.",

The pilot program can be time intensive and you'll miss out a lot doing that drive. Or, talk to an advisor and get as many pre reqs done in your year in Manhattan, then quit the band and start flight training.  ",

The band usually has scheduled practice in memorial stadium a couple hours in the afternoon every day, so most student have to organize thier class times around the morning time. Have you done research on the flight program at polytechnic? If there are a bunch of pre recs that you can do at the main campus in manhattan you could probably spend a year doing those, then transfer over to salina. ",

    "postText": "We have a 5 bedroom house with 3 rooms available. We are in a great location [right next to campus](https://i.imgur.com/LNimXJU.png) with a large kitchen, our own laundry machines, and a spacious driveway and backyard. Rent is divided evenly and comes out to about $420 per month when all the rooms are filled. Utilities are separate and are an extra $80 or so per person.\n\nStreet view of the front: https://i.imgur.com/pDrpeMa.jpeg  \nKitchen: https://i.imgur.com/GJsZCNG.jpeg\n\nThe two of us living here now are laid-back mid-20s guys. Both of us are students in tech fields. I've been living in this house for 5 years while studying at KSU and will gladly answer any questions you have.",

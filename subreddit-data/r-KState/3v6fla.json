    "postText": "I currently go to UMKC, sociology major, 21f. I really dislike that UMKC is a commuter school and there isn't a lot of college feel to it. It's a great school but I'm looking for more community. We barely have any clubs and if we do they have certain requirements like your major, race, or gender. \n\nMy boyfriend went to KSU from 2010??? to 2013??? not sure the exact dates but he loved it. All of his friends that are now graduated and moved back to KC seem to have really enjoyed it as well. From what I have heard from people who attended, it seems to be a great place with a community feel and lots of opportunities to meet new people.\n\nMy questions are-\nDo/did you like KSU? \nHow cheap could I get rent-wise? (I've never paid more than 635 in KC and I'd rather not pay any more than that)\nWas/is it easy for you to meet people, make friends, and join clubs/organizations? (I have a little bit of social anxiety but I'm willing to overcome that if I were to transfer.) ",

It didn't feel like a \"school\" at all, like you mentioned in your post. I wanted the college experience (and better professors).\n\nK-State has been awesome, and to know that I'm graduating this month is quite bittersweet.",

Most good places will rent for less than you've paid in KC.  You would have to go out of your way to not meet people and have a good time.  Lots of really good people, beautiful campus, great town, lots to do, safe, clean, cool.\n\nedit: rent range depends on if you have roomates or not.  I'd suggest checking Craigslist to get an idea.  Most typical places will probably be between $300-$600 including utils, cable, net.",

Rent will be expensive, but if you grab some roommates rent could be within your price range. This also depends on how far away you are willing to live from campus. Parking sucks.  \n\nWe had like 500 clubs or something crazy like that. KSU is a huge school, and there are plenty of professional and personal opportunities for you. The most important thing is to show up and get out there. Seek and ye shall find. I'm a junior, and I've never been happier than my time here at K-State.",

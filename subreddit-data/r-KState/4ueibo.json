Why spend $3000 on that Dell Workstation, when you can get a better computer, for a better price! Hit me up, and I'll spec out a build for you!",

For a workstation, $2000 isn't bad. However, I wasn't saying that spending 2k is necessary, i'm just saying I can go spec-for-spec and reduce the price",

Do you want to personally be on the hook for 24/7 phone / email / chat support with next business day onsite service for the next for four years for a desktop that you build, not just for hardware issues, but software / OS issues as well? I really don't think so. We sell also sell a fairly large volume of these computers every semester; can you individually provide that level of IT support for 30+ new customers per semester? I really doubt it. If I was an architecture student, I'd be choosing to build my own workstation too because I have the technical experience (and honestly, those machines are chump change compared to a lot of the workstations and servers I've built and worked with before), but I sure wouldn't want to be on the hook for supporting other students with very limited technical knowledge.\n\nIn terms of pricing, when you factor in the cost of equivalent parts, the estimated value of that service contract, and a reasonable markup for building the computer, the prices that the computer store here on campus charge are actually pretty reasonable. Is there some markup over the parts alone? Yes, Dell has to make money, the Dell distributor has to make money, and the computer store has to make money. I can't contractually go into more details, but I can say that the prices being charged are pretty much as low as both Dell and the computer store can currently go, specifically *because* they don't want to rip off the architecture students.",

Yours is well thought out, I think we just have a difference of opinion here.\n\nI have no experience with Dell \"pro\" support, but what I do have is a ton of family members over the years who have bought Dell and had many random issues that Dell ignores, or just in general shoddy build quality. I'm not gonna say all Dells are bad, but at least for a long time the $500-$1000 range was shit. My knowledge is there, but, justified or not, I have extrapolated that opinion to all Dells, at least for my own use.\n\nI would also assume that most people who even consider building over buying have some sort of knowledge of computing. I have many friends who can fix 99% of issues with a computer, no issue, but wouldn't be comfortable building a PC. It's definitely a niche market, and I'm not trying to be an OEM here, i'm just trying to offer help to the guys who know what's what with PCs, and want to get their feet wet with one of their own.\n\nI'm also not saying buying doesn't have it's benefits, a friend of mine asked me to build them one last year, and based on her technical knowledge, I advised her that buying for the Dell service was the better choice.\n\nAll in all, you make some excellent points here, but,  for the most part, they are all points that would also come up in discussion with a prospective buyer long before a \"buy now\" button was ever clicked.",

I will also say that it's been very hard for me in the past to find a decent number of people to build computers for, because, as you said, it's a pretty niche market and you really have to make good connections to have people outside of your direct friend group be interested.\n\nWith regards to Dell, go back 5-6 years, and Dell probably deserved its bad reputation at the time, but since going back to being privately owned they've really shaped up their game IMO. In terms of quality, there's still definitely a difference in quality between Dell's consumer-oriented products and support and Dell's business/enterprise-oriented products and support. That's true for pretty much any OEM, though. And compared to the other two big enterprise vendors (HP and Lenovo), Dell's support is *way* better (anecdotally, Lenovo's next business day service has often translated for me to \"whenever you escalate the issue high enough for us to get around to sending out a tech\" service.)",

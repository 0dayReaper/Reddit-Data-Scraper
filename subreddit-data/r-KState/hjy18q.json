He helped his mother recover from a stroke. He became involved with the Angel By Nature Foundation, helping deliver meals among other things. He also became involved with a ministry that helped bring men from poverty to Minnesota in a church work program that included drug rehab and job placement. He filmed an anti-gun violence video. He worked as a truck driver, bouncer, and security officer.\n\nNot a bad way to turn out for somebody who grew up in the Third Ward.\n\nHe fucked up and made a lot of mistakes earlier on, but if you choose to look at somebody for who they were rather than who they are, then you have problems that run deeper than any of the problems George Floyd had.",

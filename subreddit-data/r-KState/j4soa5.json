    "postText": "Hello.  My name is Bradley.  And I got accepted into Kansas State Thursday.  I\u2019m from Oklahoma and am originally an Oklahoma Sooners fan but I\u2019ve taken an interest in your institution for a few reasons:\n\n1.  It\u2019s where one of my favorite sports announcers, Mitch Holthus, went to school.\n\n2.  Manhattan is closer to Kansas City where my cousins live.\n\n3.  It has a 93% acceptance rate.\n\n4.  I am pursuing a career in sports journalism.\n\n5.  I have mad respect for Bill Snyder.\n\n6.  It\u2019s a way to get out of my comfort zone and grow as a person.\n\nI have also applied to Oklahoma, my dream school, and Colorado.  I am awaiting word of admission into those schools, but there is a huge part of me that wants Kansas State.  To all you Wildcats out there, please persuade me into accepting Kansas State as my future home.  EMAW.",

            "comment": "Hey Bradley. I would suggest not framing this as, \"Persuade me to come to K-State\" - because it's not Reddit's job to persuade you to go to K-State, or any college. Do your own research and ask questions, but you're not going to get a good response by posing this in a presumptive way.\n\nIf you want my two cents - all big state colleges are pretty much the same, and really the only thing that should matter to you is your goals and how they fit with *what you will learn* at the college. If you want to be a sports journalist, go to *the best* sports journalism program at any big state school you an get into. Period. Doesn't matter where it's at because, as I said, all big state schools are the same. \n\nYou're gonna live in a dorm with people you just met, all call yourselves [insert team name here], root for said team, go to football and basketball games, and on and on. Doesn't matter. What matters if the sports journalism career you hope to spend the next 50 years in - and whether you come out of a 2nd rate program writing copy at a dying newspaper, or a 1st rate program working for ESPN.  It's your choice. Forget about what teams you enjoy now, or which coach you respect. Those guys will be retired or dead by the time you're in your 30's. Think about *your* future, research it, commit to it, and don't ask other people about the college - focus in on the sports journalism programs and find people to talk to about those.",

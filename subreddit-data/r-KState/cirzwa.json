    "postText": "Hey guys! I will be a freshman next year living in Wefald. I will be bringing a dual monitor set up for my computer to my dorm and was wondering what the best way to do it was. I have a dual monitor arm mount (https://www.walmart.com/ip/Onn-Full-Motion-Dual-Monitor-Arm-For-Monitors-13-to-27/805659608) however, the desks in wefald seem to not have thick enough edges to make this work. Any ideas for how to mount my monitors?",

I've used [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JG7G2E/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) with two 27\" and a 29\" with a similar clamping system to yours on a desk top that was only 3/4\" thick particle board.\n\nIf the Wefald desks are thinner than that, maybe put a piece of thin lumber on the underside and clamp it in place with the mount?  Shouldn't need to screw it in or anything.",

It is basically just as flat as it is on the sides, maybe slightly more overhang but from what it looks like not nearly enough to use the mount system.",

You could make a square plywood base with a piece of wood cut to replace that lower jaw, with bolts through the holes the machine screws currently thread into.  Hopefully that makes sense.  You'd effectively be converting your clamp mount to a freestanding mount, in a non-permanent manner.",

Depending on how you set your room up, you could mount the monitors on the side of your bed (There are ladder sort of slats on either end of the bed, that could work). Another option that I believe someone else mentioned would be to hang the mount upside down from the metal side of the bed.",

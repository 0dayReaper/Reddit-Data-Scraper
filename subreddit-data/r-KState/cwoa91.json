In my four years here, and the years before I entered college, I\u2019ve never seen a Willie the Wildcat who isn\u2019t white. Is there some rule that makes sure every Willie looks the same (color and size) that blocks other people from auditioning to be Willie or something?",

If the mascot is a representation of the school as a whole, wouldn\u2019t there be more ethnic Willies? And maybe it won\u2019t happen now, but maybe later when demographics begin to change more.

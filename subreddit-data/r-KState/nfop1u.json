    "postText": "Anyone have insight or feedback on the Integrated Computer Science major at KSU? I'm thinking about doing that paired with a degree in Finance but I am not sure? I would love to hear some opinions? A big reason I'm reaching out about this is because I am currently a CS major but am struggling to get through Calc and I know it's only going to get harder. I like programming a lot and hope to find a career in software engineering, but might need an alternative path.\n\nIn addition to this, if there are any finance majors in here, what are internship opportunities like? Specific companies that are good to look into, career paths, etc. I'm interested in either financial advising or something to do with financial managing and investments.",

            "comment": "Hi! K-State Computer Science Teacher here. I'm one of the people directly involved in the Integrated Computer Science program at K-State. I sent a DM to make a connection.\n\nFor folks watching from home, here's the short version - the Integrated CS program is targeted at students who want to learn programming as it applies to a particular field (like finance), but without all of the heavy math and CS theory that comes with a CS degree. It's good for getting into development roles, and it might even be enough to go for a higher level position like team lead. However, it does have a bit less CS theory, so you may not have the base skills to become a software architect or some of the more advanced engineering positions. It's a tradeoff.  \nWhat you do gain is the flexibility to focus on your own interests, like finance, and find a way to blend the two together in a unique way.  \nThe ICS program is very new - we just started it this spring, so there isn't much to say about students who have graduated it just yet. Here's hoping we have some good information in the next couple of years.\n\nMore info is here: [https://www.k-state.edu/ics/](https://www.k-state.edu/ics/)\n\nI'd love to hear from some Finance majors as well - I think it would be a good fit with ICS.",

It could be well worth your time if that's where your interest lies. Just a thought.\n\nI'm not recommending them, per se, but you could check out what Udacity has to offer:  https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree",

                            "comment": "Hi!\n\nThe biggest difference is scope and accreditation. The [CS program](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/) is [ABET Accredited](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/academics/undergraduate/accreditation/) and goes deep into the technical details and theory needed to be a programmer, software architect, and more. It also is a great starting point if you want to go into research and graduate school. Because of this, it requires more math and science, and goes deep into some very tricky topics such as logic, operating systems, hardware, algorithm analysis, and more. With this degree, you'll have a much higher ceiling in terms of the jobs that you can apply for and will have the skills to perform.\n\nThe [ICS program](https://www.k-state.edu/ics/) is much more flexible - you'll learn lots of programming, including how to build your own programs with GUIs, unit testing, and more. It includes pretty much the same core programming content as the CS program, but not as much of the other theory and technical topics. You'll also learn about web development, databases, system administration, and data science (all courses that are similar to the electives that CS majors take). It also requires a bit less math and science than the CS program. The ICS program also requires you to complete a concentration in any other area, such as math, statistics, physics, business, ag, or any other major/minor/certificate at K-State. They are pretty good at finding a way to make it work. Additionally, the ICS program is available online, though not all concentrations have online availability. In terms of jobs, you'll have the skills you need to work as a programmer or developer in general or in jobs related to your concentration, but may not have the deep technical skills to move up as high or as quickly as a CS major without some additional training. \n\nHope that helps!",

            "comment": "For what it is worth here is my perspective from industry. For context I have been involved in software development for 18 years now as a program manager working with defense, telecommunication, and medical systems.\n\nA degree like this is something I as a non-technical program manager would really value on my teams. Someone who understands the coding process and the the application from an end user perspective is always very difficult to find. I typically have a lot of coders who understand code very well but do not understand the users need because they don't understand what the user is doing or I have users that know what they want but do not understand the difficulty of creating it from the coding point of view.\n\nIf you can do both you are bridging gap that exists in every industry (that I have seen) and every company (that I have worked with).\n\nIn the short term pursue the proficiency in CS and Finance. Keep an eye on the Program Management as a future career evolution. Someone that can talk deep technical details with development teams, speak with users about their needs, and run the business side of a development project will always be in demand. Give a look at the Program Management Professional certification as something to check on every few years to see if it fits where you are at that point in your career.\n\nHappy to talk further if you have any questions.",

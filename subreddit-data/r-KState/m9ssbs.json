    "postText": "Hello,\n\nThanks mods for letting us post! We hope this will be useful to some students here!\n\nIf anyone is interested in trying to (informally) connect with classmates, especially given this year's circumstances, try [www.wrotz.com](https://www.wrotz.com/) . It's for student groups, classmates and students in the same major.\n\nIf anyone here has time to check out my website, any feedback (absolutely mean ANY!) is welcome and appreciated. The website becomes more fun, the more students sign up on it. 2020 was especially hard on students, so we wanted to give something back.\n\nThanks in advance to all who give it a try!",

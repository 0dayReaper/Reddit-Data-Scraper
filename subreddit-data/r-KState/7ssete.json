Quite frankly, it is tamer than some of the stuff we used to see. (Thinking about the painted live chicken that got tossed on the court every year.) I'm fine with the chant making an appearance once or twice... when we are playing KU. Chanting it outside of that game is a new &amp; embarrassing development IMO.\n\n\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

Go to an OU game, they hold the upside down horns every chance they get.\n\nAt the UT game this year, they yell \"OU sucks\" during their fight song every single time.  After we lost in OT and were walking out of the stadium, lots of UT fans were cheering and excited (obviously), but were also yelling OU sucks at one another and cheering.\n\nIt's not just KSU by any means.",

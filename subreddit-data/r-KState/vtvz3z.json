In fear of insulting their name, which I absolutely don't want to do, it's a nuthin' special, no frills diner. Honestly can't say how much of their lunch/dinner menu I've had.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nPizza shuttle was the other choice when Bob's Diner was out of the question. Karens BTO is \ud83d\ude19\ud83d\udc4c. If you get a pepperoni, please perform a \"pizza shuttle drop\" before consuming. Just flip it over and drop the box with the pizza in it. Your arteries will thank me.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nBamboo Buffet is pretty good. Go hungry as the prices seemed to be higher. If they have the walnut chicken, go for it. It may look like a pile of semen atop breaded chicken, but I assure you it tastes heavenly.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nLittle Apple Brewing Co. was a go to when family was in town. Great beer great food, great atmosphere. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nHoulihans is interesting. It's a chain, not a local joint but we always had super good service and phenomenal food. \n\n&amp;nbsp; \nThere was a Jamaican place in the middle of nowhere (it seemed) north of town. If your up for the trek I think I remember it being good.",

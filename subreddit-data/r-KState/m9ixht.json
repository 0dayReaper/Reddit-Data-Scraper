I don't know how it works online or what they are doing this semester, and I haven't gone in a bit (bc I'm a senior and none of my classes are taught there), but SAS saved my ass. I went there like every day after lecture and just worked the entire homework with the tutor. They usually provide useful bits of knowledge. Other than that, talk to your professor and ask him if you just may not be getting everything. I'll assume you're a freshman or a sophomore based on taking calc 2, so idk how comfortable you are with your professors, but most are more than willing to help you with something, or to at least point you in the right direction",

            "comment": "When I took Calc 2, this was my test study method:\n\n* Do the study guide/practice test, and circle the questions I struggled with or didn't understand the solution. A common trap people fall into is just memorizing the solution, but it's more important to understand the concept itself that question is trying to quiz you on, since the question will probably be a little different. I found the best way to do this, was to watch YouTube videos (Khan Academy's are good) around the concept (e.g. searching for videos on integration by parts, and practicing integration by parts until I was comfortable with any integration by parts question). If I still don't understand these concepts, go to a teacher or SAS tutor.\n\n* Old exams. If I remember correctly, the math department posts old exam archives of previous year's midterms and finals for study purposes. These can make a great addition to the study guide, using the same study method as above.",

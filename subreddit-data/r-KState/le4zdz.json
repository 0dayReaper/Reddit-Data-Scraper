The legal basis sounds fishy at best. May want to even visit r/legaladvice and ask them. \n\nTo answer: Facebook, social media, etc.",

I've been paying for all the utilities, so she owes me 200+, and she's been doing stuff like smoking in the house, letting people squat here for weeks at a time, having loud parties, and being an overall horrible roommate. \n\nWe have one other roommate, and I've communicated to her in the past that this girl needs to go, but it was turned down because \"she's my friend.\" As result, both of them hate me now for suggesting that this girl gets booted. \n\nJust yesterday, my landlord tells me that he called this girl's father, and they both agreed that she needs to go, and they wanted me to find a sublet. It's all a horrible issue, and my friends and family are always giving their condolences, but I only have until this July then I am NEVER getting roommates again.",

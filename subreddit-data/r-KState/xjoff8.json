I'd be moving there from Oklahoma so I'd love to know more about the community and atmosphere in Manhattan.",

I also don't currently have student debt, and plan on getting scholarships in order to afford grad school. So, while I recognize I am saying this from a place of privilege, studying something I love is more important to me than getting a job with that degree.",

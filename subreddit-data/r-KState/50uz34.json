    "postText": "...how badly are we gunna get stomped on tonight?\n\nI'm always incredibly too optimistic for our football team - always able to devise some sort of Snyder-esque circumstances that result in a win for every single game we've played for the last 5+ years.\n\nBut I don't think I can for this game. \n\nWe're playing a very talented/experienced Cardinal squad with a possible Heisman candidate and one of the best all-purpose yardsman CFB has seen in years. Kid almost hit 4K last year. It's a prime time game. In the spotlight against Stanford. They're coming out guns blazing, and our team is way too young/under talented to mentally and or physically handle this group.\n\nSo. Someone prove me wrong or give me hope!!",

            "comment": "Here's my logic. You shouldn't ever underestimate the Bill Snyder when they're an underdog. With a healthy defense returning which some people are calling one of the best in the Big XII they have a shot to control the tempo of the game, with McCaffrey the only hope I can see is them gluing to them and trying to contain them.\n\nOffense is also something interesting. In the spring game Ertz showed why he was the one qualified to be the starter, and with a developed and improved receiving core there is no reason why we can't have a shot. The odds are against us but i have faith we will make a game of it and maybe even steal it late.",

They have multiple injured starting lineman too. I expect our D-Line to dominate but I don't know if it is enough to win. Our offense is a huge question mark like theirs. We have a decent chance to win. ",

Our offense won't be starting a QB who couldn't start in high school like we did last year (Hubener was infuriating).\n\nAnd we have one of the best football minds of all-time as our head coach.\n\nI have no clue what to expect from this team. I feel like we could be good enough to be a dark horse for the Big 12 title or maybe we'll just sneak into a bowl game like last year. Either way, I'm excited to see what happens.\n\nI don't think we're going to win, but I think it'll be a little closer than most people seem to think. I can see it being a one-posession game going into the 4th.",

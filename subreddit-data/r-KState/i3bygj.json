Anywhere in KS should take either pretty readily. Outside the state, I doubt anyone would care.",

You'll have the semester schedule with all assignments from the start, so that does help plan out when you need to work ahead for other things you want to do.\n\nWeekly due dates are common, but are ultimately up to the instructor. I think most of mine used Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday due dates. I usually just batched them together so I was working a week ahead and didn't have to stress about timing.\n\nUltimately, doing a full course load while teaching full time is a commitment, but I found it very manageable. I continued to coach and host my after school clubs and it all worked out well for me.",

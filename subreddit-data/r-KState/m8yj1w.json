As far as when, sooner is always better than later no matter what you decide, better/more options. There\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll like you\u2019re roommate but that\u2019s a nice thing about such a big state school. You\u2019ll be interacting with thousands of other students with hundreds of opportunities, you\u2019ll find a group that you like and belong to. My freshman roommate and myself did not get along at all but I had about 50 other people on my floor who I was friends with so there was always a chance to escape. Advice, go to class. Stay on top of work. The classics. Good luck.",

            "comment": "1. Would def go with the dorms if you don't know who your roommate is going to be. There are more rules for you, but that means there's also more structure if you get into a pickle. K-State is understanding of roommate issues and will try to move you (when possible) if you get a really bad one. There's a few options: traditional 2 person, traditional 2 person but you buy out the other slot in the room (so you live alone but you still have community bathing), and suites where you only have to share a bathroom with your suite-mates. There's also Jardine apartments, which is an interesting hybrid where you get the dependability of K-State, but you get your own room and a kitchen. The dorms are usually more expensive though, so that's something to consider.\n\n2. The sooner the better. For off-campus apartments within walking distance stuff goes off the market quickly. I was able to find one late last summer, but only because of the uncertainty of COVID. Since you're an incoming freshman you'll have less priority for the dorms too (returning students get first pick), so I would figure out what type of dorm you're doing for and find a roommate ASAP. \n\n3. For the dorms they have this weird \"roommate dating site\" thing that kinda works like tinder. You make a profile about what your lifestyle is like, and then you can add some stuff about what kind of roommate you're looking for.\n\n4.  Depending on the major and how quickly you want to get out of college, minors are hard to fit in. They might require summer classes or really big semesterly workloads. I wouldn't say you need to worry about it your first semester, but when you meet with your departmental advisor they'll be able to help steer you in the right direction \n\n5. Connecting with people on campus is so important. Join a club so you have some kind of support system. Make friends with teachers/ your advisor to help you find industry jobs. Find a study buddy (or a few) for your core major classes that have similar intelligences/work ethics/ etc. as you, because it's so much easier to get stuff done well and effectively when you have other people to hold you accountable\n\nGood luck buddy :)",

Thanks so much Gus :D     \n\nHopefully I get a compatible roommate in the first go itself and I don\u2019t have to change rooms lol    \n\nAs for friends, do international students find it difficult to adjust/make friends? I\u2019m hoping not haha   \n\nThanks a lot once again!",

The culture shock will depend on where you're from and what you know of here already. Are there any cultural things you're concerned/curious about specifically? Most freshman are looking to expand their horizons and make new friends, so I don't imagine that part of it will be too bad? We do have a multi-cultural center which I'm sure will be able to help point you in some helpful directions",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI am an incoming freshman. I will be living in a single private during the 2022-2023 school year. I love the privacy that I will get but fear it may cause loneliness. I am that type of person that is introverted, but extraverted at the same time. Which means I need some social interaction once every while at least, but not 24/7.\n\nI am curious, what are the best ways to make new friends at K-State? I was going to sign up for cats connect but missed the last day to sign up unfortunately. I am a pretty shy person, but once I get to know people well, I talk pretty frequently.",

If there\u2019s any clubs that interest you definitely go to their meetings and get involved. Don\u2019t be afraid to start a conversation at the beginning/end of class, especially in the first couple of weeks. GO TO FOOTBALL GAMES! \n\nIf you want someone to reach out to for questions/resources/things to do, don\u2019t be afraid to PM me and we can get connected on discord/snapchat whatever. I absolutely loved my freshman year, and I hope you do as well. Go Cats!",

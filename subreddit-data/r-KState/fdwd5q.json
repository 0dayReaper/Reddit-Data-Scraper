I don't know much about UT, but between Manhattan, KS, and Columbia, MO, I much prefer Manhattan. KSU regularly ranks at the top of happiest college campuses/happiest students, rankings.",

Good engineering school, our athletics are definitely the best of those three schools if that matters to you.  If you like drinking alcohol this is the right place.",

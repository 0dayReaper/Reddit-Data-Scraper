I also miss the hell out of the dinning centers. It\u2019s essentially an all you can eat buffet every meal. \n\n3) Buy student tickets for sporting events. Even if you can\u2019t attend you can make your money back and then some by renting it out to others. \n\nGood luck and welcome to the Family. EMAW",

(Besides the no sleep)\n\nI\u2019m currently in the dorms and as of now I plan on living there my sophomore year. I\u2019m in the derby complex and besides the renovations, it\u2019s been amazing. I have friends in Kramer (the newer one) and they love it, same with Van Zile. \n\nI recommend touring the dorms for all complex\u2019s and seeing what one fits you best and what is closer to the Architecture building. \n\nIs there any other things you have interest in? I\u2019d be happy to help!",

If you are thinking about architecture I would highly recommend shadowing some architects and making sure you you like the day to day work before going to school for it. And try to do a whole summer or more than just one day if you can. A lot of people don\u2019t understand what the actual job is like. Otherwise, I lived in the dorms freshman year and highly recommend it! KSU is awesome.",

It's one of the most beautiful campus's I've ever seen, and I've been to quite a few throughout the Midwest. Housing is great as far as I'm concerned. There are dorms on the west side of campus near the Architecture building that would put you a 10 minute walk from your classes. The dining centers were awesome. I miss the food there.  \n3. KSU is a fun and friendly place to go. You'll make life long friends there as long as you get out and meet people. Join clubs, do activities, say yes if someone asks you to do something. Apply yourself to each day. Those 4 years are extremely short, and you'll wish you were back in Manhappiness for the rest of your life.",

            "comment": "IAPD alum. \n\nIt is a good program and if you stick it out the people you study with will become extended family. Also know that the first couple years are grueling for several reasons that vary depending on how you function. Not to scare you off, but first couple semesters expect half the class to drop.\n\nCampus housing is great for the first year, make new friends and become roommates off campus later. Community floors are much more social than suites, it's much easier to meet like minded people. \n\nHighly recommend getting involved with other student groups outside of Seaton if you can. Broadens your circles and gets you to see daylight outside of studio! Rowed for the Men's crew(FYI women are allowed as well, non NCAA) and got to meet all sorts of other majors while working out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck! EMAW!",

Hard to get lost after the first two weeks. Housing is great. Haymaker for a strong community. But other than that it's a great place. DM me if you want any more specific questions. Even tho I'm a MNE major I should be able to find someone in the program to help answer questions.",

Son lived in dorm first semester of freshman year and then moved into a fraternity house after making a lot of friends and meeting his gf.\n3. Agree that parking permit doesn't mean you can find parking.  We are from way OOS so S needed a car.  First semester was a pain.  Parking at the frat house has been so much easier for him and he hasn't bought a parking pass since.  People are great and campus is very friendly.  Get involved, clubs, Greek, etc.  You can be Greek and get good/excellent grades in very difficult programs (if not we parents would have quit paying for it!).  But you don't have to be Greek to have a great time on campus.\n\nMom of a Junior here.  We are very happy with the school and think he made a great decision to go there.",

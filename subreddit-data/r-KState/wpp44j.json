            "comment": "Selling or transferring student tickets is rather annoying for us due to changes implemented last year. I think you\u2019d honestly have better luck just looking for normal tickets then crossing into the student section from the normal crowd, they check student ID\u2019s at the top of the student section. When you get in just make sure you\u2019re not in the ICAT section, that\u2019s the \u201chigh\u201d tier student tickets and they actively kick people out of that. Hope this helps!",

It should be like section 25-27 or something. ICAT is section 24 I believe, but just keep making your way towards where the band is and you should get into the normal student section with no issues.",

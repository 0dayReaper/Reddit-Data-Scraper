    "postText": "We are now under one week to go from both the Republican and Democratic Kansas Presidential caucuses, both occurring on March 5th. In case you don't know about the caucuses &amp; might wish to participate, I thought I would share the information here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst, find out if you're already registered [here.] (https://myvoteinfo.voteks.org/VoterView/Home.do) If you aren't registered and wished to vote in the Republican caucus, I'm sorry, but tough luck. You would have needed to be registered by February 4th. If you were registered Republican by that date or wish to participate in the Democratic caucus, keep on reading.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, on to each party's caucus:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Democratic caucus: Must be a registered Democrat in order to participate. You may change or update your registration at the caucus, though I would suggest updating it [here] (https://www.kdor.org/voterregistration/) ahead of time to avoid problems. It only takes a few minutes. Doors open at 1:00 for registration and the caucus is schedule to begin at 3:00 (must be in line at 3:00 in order to participate, even if you haven't been able to register yet). The Kansas Democratic caucus method is different from the Republican method in that voting takes place fairly out in the open and can take some time. Be prepared to be there at least an hour after 3:00, maybe substantially more. Your caucus location is based on both your state senate district and your US Congressional district, though this [site] (http://www.ksdp.org/where-to-caucus/) will tell you where to go based on your address. As Kansas contains 105 counties yet there are only 41 caucus locations, you may have to travel a fair bit. If you can claim Manhattan residency, your caucus location will be Anthony Middle School on Browning.\n\nYou can find general information on the caucus [here.](http://www.ksdp.org/caucus-2016/)\n\nSpecific information on where to caucus [here.] (http://www.ksdp.org/where-to-caucus/)\n\nKansas Democratic Caucus [rules.] (https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ksdems/KDP_2016_Delegate_Selection_Plan.pdf)   \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n  \n*Republican caucus: Must be a registered Republican in order to participate. You must have been registered by February 4th in order to participate (sorry, only recently decided to post this information). Doors open at 10:00 a.m and close at 2:00 (2:00 is when voting is supposed to end, but if people are in line, they might be counted). Caucusing is done by secret ballot and you do not need to stay once your ballot has been cast. Your caucus location is based on the county in which you live, though you might not caucus in your county. Again, Kansas has 105 counties but there are 102 caucus locations, with some counties sharing one location while Johnson county actually contains 9 caucus locations, so you may or may not have to travel a distance. If you can claim Manhattan residency, your caucus location will be Manhattan High School (at Sunset &amp; Poyntz).\n\nYou can find general information on the caucus [here.] (http://www.ksgop.org/#!caucus/cl95)\n\nSpecific information on where to caucus [here.] (http://www.ksgop.org/#!caucus-locations/vopsn)\n\nKansas Republican Caucus [rules.] (http://media.wix.com/ugd/8353d3_44900070850142769698e17dde76f00d.pdf)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNote that for the Republican caucus you must have a government-issued picture ID. For the Democratic caucus, if you are already registered, I don't believe this is the case. However, I would suggest taking along an ID just in case. If you are not yet registered or are changing parties and plan to register at the Democratic caucus, I would suggest taking along at minimum an ID as well as possibly some document that proves citizenship (birth certificate or passport) and possibly even something that proves your address (utility bill, mail, etc). Better safe than sorry.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNote also that there will be a statewide primary on August 2nd for all other offices (must be registered by July 12, but I believe you can change affiliation on August 2nd). March 5 is just the presidential preference election. You may change your party affiliation in between the caucuses and the primary election, should you so wish.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFinally, there are two other widely attended events occurring on that Saturday. Fake Paddy's day in Manhattan and the final scheduled home game for men's basketball at KU. Not going to nag any more than this, it's your choice as to what's important to you.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFull disclosure: Personally, I'm going to be attending the Democratic caucus in Manhattan in order to caucus for Sanders. I felt it would be a good idea to get all this information for both parties out for everyone in this sub. If you are also in Manhattan and attending the Democratic caucus, feel free to message me if you need a ride. My car can (somewhat uncomfortably) hold 4 people in addition to me and I am willing to make multiple trips both to and from the caucus. Please message me early so I can plan a route.",

If you're already registered with a non-Manhattan address, it's no problem. You will simply have to re-register with your Manhattan address at the caucus from 1-3. Earlier is better than later. If you're already registered, even for a different address, you don't have to prove citizenship to change details about your registration. Just show up with a driver's license or similar ID, just in case.",

    "postText": "I am in search of a relet for my apartment starting in August 2022.     I live at the Gramercy Apartments located at 2215 College Ave. Manhattan, Kansas 66502.\u00a0 It is just a hop and a skip away from the football stadium! My current rent rate is $529 for a 2 bedroom apartment and my lease ends on July 31, 2022.\u00a0 You will be responsible for electricity and water. The average for water is about $9.27 per month and $49.78 for electricity.\u00a0 The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable, and internet.\u00a0 Another great thing about reletting is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my relet and you can move into any apartment within the complex.\nI've lived in just one other apartment complex before and it was the campus ones. The Gramercy is soooo much better!! I'm honestly so sad that I have to move but I got a job in a different state and need to plan on moving! \n\nThe Gramercy offers a lot of other amenities as well. My personal favorite couple of things about living here is that it is pet friendly(i personally have 1 cat and a rabbit and my roommates her cat with us), they have study spaces and free printing, and probably the biggest thing for me was that the apartments come fully furnished. This includes a bed, dresser, desk, couch, side chair, coffee table, and entertainment stand. I also love the pool!",

Always from a brand new account.\n\nGramarcy is widely known to be the worst place to live if you are a student. They prey on incoming freshmen who haven't heard about the reputation of the place yet. They use scummy \"advertising\" like this post right here.",

Why does your post read exacltly like the dozen other Gramarcy ads that have been posted?\n\nAlso, Jardine, while being 50% more expensive than Gramarcy, is a paradise compared to your dump. You're not fooling anyone.",

Crazy coincidence, right?\n\nYou are a liar and you are bad at your job. I'm tired of you posting your crap on this subreddit. Every time you do it, I will call you out, and I will link the mods as well. You are breaking rule 3 of this subreddit and doing a terrible job hiding it.\n\nOne last note. Those links above were easy to search for, but they also turned up [this very accurate write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/KState/comments/hklztz/do_not_move_to_the_gramercy_crosspost/) of what is wrong with your shithole apartment complex. Short answer: everything. Credit to u/hannartemis for that post.\n\nMods: u/astroot u/nobrate u/Jonny2k1 u/hbgoddard pls remove these posts if you see them in the future. It's note the same account, the guy creates a new account every time. See links above and check out the profiles.",

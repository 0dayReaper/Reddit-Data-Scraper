    "postText": "Hello all, I am an incoming freshman for the Fall 2019 semester, enrolling in the architecture program. The only math course I'm required to take is college algebra but I am torn between the two different class types offered. I don't have the strongest math background because I was homeschooled and my parents never bothered to actually teach me - I think my math education is equivalent to algebra I, geometry, and maybe a little bit of algebra II. Regardless, it was enough for me to receive a (slightly less than) mediocre score on the ACT and math placement test. Anyway, I am wondering if anyone has some advice to offer me regarding whether I should take the studio or traditional college algebra class.",

By the time I got an acceptable placement test score enrollment for the summer semester was closed, plus I already signed up to take speech and some electives. After this summer I'll have maxed out the number of general electives required for my undergrad plus I'll have dual credit for speech and physics (both freshman classes for the arch program) so I need to take college algebra to maintain 12 credit hours.",

You can call the Help Desk (785-532-7722) if you need help finding it.\n\nI would recommend taking all genEds at community college. You're wasting your time and money taking it at kstate. Plus the genEd classes usually have like 80+ people in it so you get no help from the teacher if you need it.",

I've taken them all except for college algebra, and it's still too late for me to take it this summer. Its also a prerequisite for my physics class second semester, so I can't take it next summer.

Lectures are huge classrooms with hundreds of people, no opportunity for asking questions.

If you do poorly, the transfer credits don't count towards GPA, just goes on your record as pass or fail. If you're in the area, I've heard good things about Highland Community College (25mins from Manhattan in Wamego)",

            "comment": "Listen to the other folks. We are supporters of kstate, and everybody is telling you to not take maths there.\n\nThey are all set up in a pattern of first- and third-day (like Mon and Wed) lectures in a big auditorium with two or three hundred other students. Hard to see everything that's written on the board unless you get there early to get a decent seat. It's hard to even get there early because there will be another class in that auditorium that doesn't dismiss until 10 minutes before your class starts. The hallways in Calvin Hall are extremely crowded before and after class.\n\nOn the 2nd and 4th days (like tues and thurs) there is \"recitation\", a smaller class of 30 or so that is supposed to cover the lecture topic from the day before in greater detail and assign homework. I was 0 for 3 on my recitation teachers. I had a Chinese grad student with an accent so thick I couldn't understand him, but he was the best of them. After him, I had the angriest old man I've ever known, who used to berate several students each class for not understanding math well enough. Seriously. His name was Alexander Ramm. After him, I had another very angry man who would berate anyone he felt wasn't paying close enough attention. He chewed me out once for reading the collegian newspaper several minutes before class even started.\n\nSo yeah, I know you think you can't do it at a community college, but you can. Put it off and take it in a year or two. Don't be a full-time student when you take it over the summer. Or look into taking it as a distance (online) course from somewhere transferable. \n\nOr maybe just rethink the whole architecture thing. I know a ton of people who started in the program or changed majors to it, but I don't know a single person who graduated the program. They all switched to something else. A required 5th year means you're paying 20% more for college, and also graduating a year later when all your friends have already made 40 or 50 or 60k in the year you've been finishing up. Plus the job market is tough for architects. You won't be designing skyscrapers and public buildings, you'll be lucky to land a job designing renovation work for old run down buildings.\n\nAnyway, sorry to poop all over everything, I think it's very commendable to have some direction at your age. I had no idea what to do or major in the summer before my freshmen year. If you want time to consider other options, ask your orientation advisor if you can just enroll with an undeclared major and take gen eds for a semester or two. You'll meet a lot of people your first year and find out about majors you didn't even know existed.",

I feel like it's the best way to go, because that extra year isn't for nothing, you're getting a master's degree with it. I've decided I'm going to take the class, I just need to figure out which version would work best for me. This thread has helped a lot - I think I am going to take the studio math class rather than the traditional. Additionally, if I drop below full-time hours I lose my scholarships and it screws up my financial aid. Plus I'm pretty sure you have to be full-time to live in the dorms too",

Many have online options to take, and it might be too late to apply and enroll in the class (assuming it starts next week like my summer class does) but you should look into it, that way you don\u2019t get behind. I\u2019m sure you can find another class to take in the fall, or even consider taking public speaking (an easy A) this fall to boost your GPA and to take the college algebra class this summer since transfer credits don\u2019t affect your KSU GPA. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t live in another CC\u2019s county (if you take it online) it will still probably be cheaper than taking the class at KSU. I took Calc 1 last summer at my local CC so I didn\u2019t have to do any math classes for my degree at KSU. \n\n\nI agree with others about the difficulty of math classes at KSU, I took physics last semester and struggled a lot, and I\u2019ve heard quite a bit from my friends about the math classes not being set up or taught well. If you are unable to take it over the summer, I would suggest taking the studio option, as I understand that those have smaller classes and more teacher-student interaction.",

Your hand is not going to be held. Expect to spend time outside of class studying. It\u2019s not supposed to be easy. None of this is unique to Kstate. \n\nMy recommendation is to take traditional college algebra. I understand you\u2019re not confident about math, but of all the challenging undergraduate math classes offered here, college algebra is at the bottom of that pyramid. You\u2019re going to make friends in engineering/science/math who will take Calc 1-3 and onward. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re naturally more talented than you are, they\u2019ve just learned the process. I promise you can pass college algebra with at least a B. You will have access to tutors, recitation instructors, and the entire internet for supplemental assistance.\n\nI think you will be missing out on a key component of your education if you never have to take a math class that made you struggle and grow.",

I'm not particularly bad at math, all of the coursework I have done I've done well on - the problem is just that my parents didn't really care about those core subjects, our homeschool curriculum was focused on biblical teachings exclusively, so they stopped providing math curriculum for me after I finished algebra I and I never realized how behind I was. I actually enjoy math and understand most of it pretty well and I would like to take harder classes in the future just to solidify my math background as compensation for what I missed out on in high school.",

If you ask me to do any mental arithmetic I will probably just give up. My math score on the ACT was so low that I wouldn't have been accepted into the engineering college at another school I was looking at.\n\nThat being said, I was able to get an A in Calc 2, a B in discrete math, and an A in engineering statistics. These are grades that I'm proud of because I genuinely earned them.\n\nI think if you take college algebra and do well in it, you'll appreciate that you allowed yourself the opportunity to have a small victory. One of the most empowering things about college is the realization that you'll get out of it what you put into it.\n\nIf you do decide to take it, just remember that you learn math by doing it, not by watching someone else do it. I think Khan Academy can be a little dangerous because Sal is so good at explaining math that he can sometimes inspire false confidence. It's all about problems, problems, problems.

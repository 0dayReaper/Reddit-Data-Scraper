Just know that, 1) you get used to it. 2) it\u2019s not all bad. 3) there is a reason K-State is among the top Arch programs in the country.",

If you stick with it, you learn a ton.\n\nOn the worst of days, we would stay up for 30 plus hours working on drawings. It's all by hand too. You get close to people in your class though. It's an incredible bonding experience.",

You will do nothing but studio and some days you won\u2019t have time to eat, shower, or sleep. It gets less intense after freshman year but is still a huge time commitment. For example, my boyfriend majored in computer science and took 18 credit hour semesters and worked 30 hours a week and I did more school than he did school and work. By a lot. Having that said, the projects you work on can be really cool, the friends are great, and architecture is slightly less time consuming than interior architecture (although any architect would not admit that haha). Feel free to DM me any questions. My best advice to to intern/shadow at a few firms and get a sense of the work you will actually be doing. It\u2019s not what most people think it is. Good luck!",

They will go around campus doing sketches and using equipment to measure. It\u2019s no doubt one of the most intensive programs here though.",

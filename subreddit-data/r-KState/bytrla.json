At football games the gate between GA and ICAT drops after 20 minutes. It doesn\u2019t for basketball games. ICAT gives you 50-40 yard line spots at football games, and closer to half court at basketball games too. Would highly recommend getting a basketball pass if you go GA, they are a ton of fun.",

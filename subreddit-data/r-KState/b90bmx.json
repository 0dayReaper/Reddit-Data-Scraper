    "postText": "Hello,\n\nAnything I should know in advance about going the Spring Football game? Things to look for things to avoid? Thanks!\n\nI am also looking at going to the K-State vs TCU baseball game. I assume purchasing tickets day of the game isn't an issue? I haven't really picked the day(s) I want to attend and kinda hate locking myself into a date as I typically kind just make up my mind last minute with these types of things. Also any advice for a Friendly Frog at the Baseball game is appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

I dont know what the new coach is planning but its not going to be a typical scrimmage i believe due to injuries and lack of depth. \n\nThe baseball games are usually pretty laid back. Not a ton of baseball fans in Manhattan so getting tickets should be no problem. Parking can be a potential issue for baseball though. If they let you park at the football stadium its not a bad walk though.",

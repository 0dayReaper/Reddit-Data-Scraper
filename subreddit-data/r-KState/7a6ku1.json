I've never had my car spray painted but that seems weird. Then the writing itself: there is a backwards swastika and then the words literally seem like someone went down a list of stuff that is supposed to be offensive. I mean, if you are already dropping the N bomb are you really going to use the word \"boy\" in a pejorative sense? It's like dropping a nuclear bomb then punching someone. The victim said he doesn't want more publicity but... that doesn't seem to be the case, obviously.\n\nThere was an incident similar to this in KC recently where a traditionally black church was vandalized in a similar way and the local paper got all worked up until it turned out that it was a black employee who did it while trying to cover up a theft. At a minimum, I wish people would wait until the evidence is in before people start freaking out.",

The words appear to be written in glass chalk and are almost exclusively on the windows so as to cause minimal damage to the car. I really hope whoever did this gets caught, fake or not this does not belong on our campus ever.",

My bet is that this is a false flag act, possibly even involving the owner of the car and/or his girlfriend.  You'd think someone who would do something like this wouldn't do it with something you can just wash off at the gas station.  Also, if you look at the picture and read the description of what was written, it sounds kind of cliche - almost like what a victim would *think* a perpetrator would write.  If this really did happen, I hope they catch whoever did it, but I doubt anything will come of this.  Just my two cents.",

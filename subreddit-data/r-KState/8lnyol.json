    "postText": "I am in search for a subleasor for my apartment starting in August.\n\nThe apartment complex name is the Gramercy Apartments and it is located at [2215 College Ave. Manhattan, Kansas 66502](https://maps.google.com/?q=2215+College+Ave.+Manhattan,+Kansas+66502&amp;entry=gmail&amp;source=g).  It\u2019s within walking distance of the football stadium. The rent is $399 and the lease ends on 31st May 2019**.**  The only utilities that you will be responsible for is electricity and water.  The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable and internet.  If you would like wireless internet you are responsible for providing your own router.  Another great thing about subleasing is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my subleasor and you can move into any apartment within the complex.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me at [chavezcristina765@gmail.com](mailto:chavezcristina765@gmail.com) . If you would like to set up a tour or have any additional questions you can contact the leasing manager at \\(785\\)539\\-0500.",

This place manages to be both engaging and relaxed at the same time. It's not big, just about 50,000 people, but it's big enough that it feels like a city and it's very centered on students, lots of young people. Partying happens, I think that depends on who you're friends with. The football games are ridiculously fun, especially when we win, which is regularly. \n\nAs an educational institution, it's highly respectable. If you're getting into anything to do with agribusiness, this is where you want to be, but in all types of business, you can get a good foundation.",

It has Aggieville, which is great for bars when you're old enough but also has other shops and good food. There are also tons of house parties all the time (I assume, since there were when I was last there in 2008). I'm probably biased since I grew up near Manhattan, but the people there are generally very friendly. With the university there and military near by it's a pretty neat melting pot. I'm not sure what sports you're in to, but football and basketball games were always really fun, and there are plenty of other teams at KSU to cheer on, or look in to joining. If you have any other questions or are wondering about anything else I can try to help you out!",

For sports football is definitely more popular around here, we've had about $100 million in renovations to our stadium in the past 4 years and the game day experience is awesome, basketball is also pretty popular just not to the extent of football. \n\nFor partying, there's not really an underage bar scene but house/fraternity parties keep people entertained until they're 21. If you're interested in going Greek I'd highly recommend it, being in a fraternity was a blast and K-State's Greek life is pretty strong.\n\nI also just graduated with a Business degree if you have any questions pertaining to that, we just opened a new business building that I hear is great.",

            "comment": "I'm an alumnus of the K-State College of Business.  I know you didn't ask about the quality of education (concerning) but I will address it anyhow.  The school compares favorably to other state universities.  An undergrad business degree is very curriculum based, so it's going to be very similar in about 75% of the content to the other schools you listed.  What differentiates K-State is going to be facilities, staff, and what businesses recruit out of the school.\n\nThere is a BRAND NEW business building (of which I am very jealous) that appears to be very state-of-the-art.  The staff was absolutely amazing while I was there.  Since the MIS program was only 60 students in a graduating class, we basically had one professor for all of our classes.  This made for a learning experience that was really catered to us and he had time to devote to helping us.  Many excellent businesses recruit out of K-State, including the Big 4 consulting firms, Koch Industries (politics aside, a great company to work for), and ConocoPhilips.\n\nBe sure to decide early what major you want.  Any major is fine as long as you really know what you want to be doing after school.  If you are unsure, don't do Marketing or Advertising.  General Business is better.  MIS is even better in that average pay is higher and there are ten gazillion jobs available in technology.  Finance is best in pay but is a very focused field and has fewer jobs available.  If you're doing Accounting, plan on getting your grad degree.  I believe K-State has a 5 year Masters in Accountancy program.  You should take advantage of it.  Supposedly K-State as a great Entrepreneurship program but I'm wary of that as a major for anyone.  You can probably make it through Freshman year before you really have to decide, as you'll have general business courses to take.  DO NOT TAKE THE ENTRY LEVEL FINANCE COURSE UNTIL YOU ARE REALLY, REALLY PREPARED.",

He then proceeded to secretly apply for the position and was hired. Many believe that he is simply holding the position until Sam Brownback's current (and final) term is finished in two years, at which point General Myers will resign and the board will appoint Brownback as the new President of K-State.\n\nAnd then there's this gem which I fully expect to be quoted by one or more Daily Show alumni within the next couple of weeks:\n\n&gt;Kansas State administration released a statement Wednesday accusing the media of inaccuracies in their reporting of the university\u2019s sexual assault policies but then refused to say what the inaccuracies were when the Collegian asked for specifics.",

It would be a real shame if the man who gutted the state's education system became the leader of the school. That's putting it mildly. Jeez...I'd rather he just be a part of Trump's cabinet...as awful as that idea is.",

Those rumors were kicked around before the election, though. If he does get appointed Secretary of Agriculture, it might be for the best from the university's perspective.\n\nAnd as far as the lawsuits go, you can find quite a bit of information about it via Google, as various mainstream news outlets have picked it up. The Collegian also has some good pieces, including the SGA demanding that the school fulfill their legal obligations. I haven't seen any on campus protests yet, but I suspect they'll be coming. Especially since the University publicly stated just a few weeks ago that all of campus is considered a free speech zone and there are no permits required for students to protest.",

Which many would consider expensive out here but we just moved from California- this is so cheap.\n\nWe read their old reviews and were very hesitant.  I have yet to see a red flag from them on anything related to the lease itself, the apartment, or the people we have been emailing with sending all our documents into.",

I assume there could be some quite a bit cheaper.\n\nHowever, we believe it is a \u201call in one\u201d washer/dryer.  Which after we googled, apparently they have problems with the drying aspect.  Since it\u2019s just us two, smaller loads to help drying won\u2019t be a problem.  \n\nThe complex itself looked good.  Lots of parking and far enough from campus where it\u2019ll be a bit quieter but near enough to bike there.",

Maintenance is on top of things, we have a pool, in unit laundry works like it should, the porch is fairly large, it's fairly quiet, the hill is really well taken care of in the winter when snow and ice hit. Anything else you want to know? I'm happy to answer questions! I've lived here for 3 years",

I saw on the floorplan there is a patio / deck, but looking on google maps satellite I didn't see any. \n \n* How soundproof are the walls?  Can you hear your neighbors pretty good or is there some sound proofing?\n\n* Anything you wish you knew before you moved in?\n\nThanks!  You can DM me the answers if you'd rather.",

We have a bistro set, flower pots, two zero gravity chairs, and a grill on ours! \n*We can sometimes hear our upstairs neighbor when he's using his sound system. But it's generally pretty quiet. I pretty much never hear anybody but my upstairs neighbor.\n*We (my fiance and I) can't  really think of anything except maybe the loose outlets. But maintenance was quick to fix what they could. So bring some kind of charger to test them if you look at any units. It hasn't really caused too many problems though. We also took as is, so they didn't do anything to it before we moved in.\n*Concerns we have: security of the front door. But we've never had an issue. Our original property manager was very open about everything. Air gets a little stagnant unless the air is running, but fans solve that problem fairly easy.",

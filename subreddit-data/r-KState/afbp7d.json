    "postText": "I am looking for someone to sublease my apartment starting in the fall semester of 2019 through the spring semester of 2020. My apartment is in the Gramercy Apartments off of College Ave. It is perfect walking distance to the stadium for gamedays and is only about 5 minutes from campus. The current rent rate for 4 bedroom apartment is $399 and a 2 bedroom is $529. One great thing is you don't have to move into my apartment, all you do is agree to sublease for me, and then you can move into any apartment within the complex! The apartment complex is very well-kept, management cares for their residents, and I have loved living there!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMessage me if you are interested or want more details! ",

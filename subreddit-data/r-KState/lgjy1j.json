    "postText": "Hello, my boyfriend recently lost his job, and he is needing a new one fast. Manhattan seems to be an employment wasteland, and he cannot seem to find anything that'll pay a living wage. He's a member of the national guard, and is a licensed welder and is very skilled in small arms. \nHe's tried with USA jobs and indeed, and is just having a hard time. Reddit seems to be a weird place to ask this, but does anybody have any advice for us? Anything would be appreciated.",

I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s pretty new to the guard?  The guard is a great place to network fro a job - I was a sniper out in the KS guard and still talk to\nmy buddies all the time",

He's been trying with USA jobs, and hasn't had much luck. He seems more inclined to warehouse/factory work, but I will forward that information to him. Thanks!",

Unfortunately, companies often do not post on those public sites until they are desperate. Usually companies with big names can get enough applicants without paying to post on a third party site. Small companies don't always use them because of the fees associated with recruiting and posting open positions.",

Even though he lived in Manhattan all but one of his jobs were located in Junction City (the other was in Topeka).\n\nI'd agree that Manhattan is an employment wasteland; after I graduated from KSU I wanted to stay in the area, but without any real industry to speak of in town there were really no options for me either. I'd recommend looking at Junction, Wamego, or Topeka if he wants to stay in the area.",

Everyone I\u2019ve talked to really enjoyed their time in the program and had good things to say about it. ",

She had a great experience and really liked her professors and advisors. She was also able to work with a lead role in a professional club there, which helped her get a job where she wanted immediately after graduating. We don't know much about competing schools, but she would certainly recommend you looking into it more!",

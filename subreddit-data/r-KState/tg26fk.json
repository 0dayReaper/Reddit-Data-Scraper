    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all, I am currently thinking about applying to K State for grad school. I\u2019m graduating from FSU next spring with a degree in political science and am considering applying for a couple different programs at K State, primarily either the MBA in the school of business or a masters in public policy/one of the political science related masters. I had a couple of questions for everyone about what K State and the grad school is like.\n\nSo my first question, is for any current or alums of the grad programs I mentioned earlier how did you like the school and the courses you took?\n\nSecondly, I was wondering what COL is like in Manhattan/Kansas in general? What are like the average prices for apartments within a reasonable distance of campus and stuff like that. \n\nThank you to everyone in advanced!",

I live in an apartment building roughly 3/4 of a mile walk from the Student Union and the building most of your PoliSci courses would be in. We pay $800 total ($400 a person) a month for a fairly spacious 2-bed/1-bath apartment. It's all electric and the building pays water, so our only bills are electricity and internet. I think our rent is pretty standard, but there's some luxury apartments even closer to campus that rent by the room for more money and of course there's always older houses for rent surrounding campus on three sides.\n\nKansas--like the rest of the region-- has fairly low food, energy and gas prices compared to other parts of the country as well.\n\nManhattan is definitely a small college town in the middle of nowhere but has basically everything you could want, imo. It's a town of about 50k that revolves around the university and Fort Riley down the road a little ways. There's good bars and restaurants, two breweries, hiking, nightlife all wrapped up in a tight-knit community. I'd say the town and school are fairly conservative, but compared to the rest of the state it is pretty liberal. I've been here six years (undergrad and grad school) and I love it.",

            "comment": "Graduate Student Alumni here. \n\nThe COL in Manhattan is dirt cheap, but more expensive than it was in 2010-2012 when I lived there. We paid just over $600/month for a brand new apartment that we loved which was just over a half mile away from campus. I walked to and from campus daily all year round. In the winter, it wasn't bad. In the summer when I teaching classes, I needed a shower by the time I got to campus. \n\nGrad life on campus really varies department-by-department. My department had a very active grad program that had a lot of social events which made it really easy to meet new folks. I was on the graduate student council and this was not the case with some of my peers from other programs. \n\nI work in the broad field of public policy and would encourage you to think about what you hope to get from this program. One of the super important things that you can get from a graduate department (aside from the education) are the connections that you make with other grad students and professionals. KState is a regional school that doesn't have a ton of pull outside of Kansas so you might find that your connections don't travel well. I got super lucky in life, but that's not always going to the the case.",

            "comment": "I can't answer about that program, but for cost of living...\n\nIt goes up exponentially as you get within a few blocks of campus. If you don't mind being out a couple of miles, you can get a nice apartment for $650-$800/month. If you want right next to campus, you're looking at nearly that cost for a small place with roommates.\n\nMost places anywhere near campus are filling up now for fall leases.\n\nIf you want a recommendation for landlords, one of my (grown and married) kids (yeah, I'm an old geezer) rents from [http://aggietown.net/](http://aggietown.net/) and they've been very responsive and reasonable.",

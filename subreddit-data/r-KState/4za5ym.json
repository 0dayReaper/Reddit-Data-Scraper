    "postText": "I've been thinking about transferring to K-State for a bit now. I want to visit before making a firm decision but won't be able to do so for a couple of months due to my school schedule. So what's a better way to get a feel of a place than to go on Reddit and ask people, right? \n\nAll I'm wondering is just overall how is K-State? Is there lots to do on campus clubs and sports wise? What's there to do in Manhattan, KS? How's the pre-medical program there? Pretty much any information of this school is welcome!\n\nEdit: Also, what in the world is Aggieville?",

            "comment": "Well first off, Aggieville is an area of town right next to campus with lots of bars and food that's full of people every weekend. Students will often go there to hang out and unwind or party like wild animals.\n\nK-State is overall a very nice university. The people are friendly, the campus is nice and compact and very pretty, and the academics are top notch. There are an incredible amounts of clubs and student organizations, so you'd be able to find one for anything from building robots to skydiving. Intramural sports are also quite popular, and there's a rec center with all sorts of equipment and courts/fields.\n\nAs for the greater Manhattan area, there's a wonderful biking trail that goes around the city if that's something you're interested in. There's also Sunset Zoo, the K-State botanical garden, several museums, and plenty of parks, lakes, and hiking trails.\n\nUnfortunately all I can tell you about the pre-med program here is that I've heard good things about it, but I'm an engineering student so I don't have much insight into that area. I'll be happy to try and answer any other questions you have, though!",

            "comment": "K-State is a great school and Manhattan is an amazing town.  By far the best university in the state but i may be biased.  We're nationally ranked in a number of important things.  Our Rec is in the top ten in the country, our students are in the top five of happiest students, and we're the 2nd fittest student body.  Those are silly things but it should give you a good idea.  Also, Intramural sports are insane.  Very competitive and there's a wide range to pick from.  Flag football and basketball to inner tube water polo to wrestling to video games.  Literally anything.  Manhattan has a lot to do as well.  And there's always people willing to do anything.  Also, it's a fair mix between conservative and liberal people so there are all kinds of backgrounds to experience and get to know.  Sorry if I'm rambling, but I'm in class and can't keep my thoughts straight.  Good luck!",

We're definitely better at engineering, and our vet has a HUGE national reputation. Obviously KU is better for pre-med or architecture, but engineering isn't even a contest.",

I\u2019m an incoming freshman in Computer Engineering and I have two quiz sections on my schedule, one for Chemistry 2 and Calculus 2 on Monday and Tuesday night respectively.\n\nI was just wondering if that\u2019s something I go to every week and just how they work in general. Thank you!",

They usually don\u2019t happen every week though - it depends on the class, and the professor should tell you (probably in the syllabus) which weeks you\u2019ll actually have to meet for that exam. Some classes have them as often as every other week, some are closer to once a month.",

The professor will likely send an email out to the whole class saying so before classes start, but even if they don\u2019t, you won\u2019t be expected to show up anywhere until your first lecture or recitation/lab (and even those are sometimes cancelled until after your first lecture, but that depends on the class). I can almost guarantee the professor will explain the schedule in an email by Sunday.",

But the function of having it as a separate zero credit hour \"class\" is so it blocks off your schedule during that time, preventing conflicts with other classes. Exams can't be retaken (unless the sky is literally-ass falling) so they bend over backwards to prevent you from missing them. And one super easy way of accidentally doing that would be to enroll in another class during that time slot.",

Sometimes all of the machines in the laundry room would be busy, but it's 24-hour access so I'd just do my laundry in the morning or after midnight. The fitness room was small but not too many people used it anyway since the kstate rec is close by. Some of this info may no longer be accurate, I lived there a decade ago when they were called the \"chase apartments\", probably different ownership now.\n\nDon't live at Gramarcy (used to be University Crossing), that place is a dump.",

About the same walk time as getting the kstate campus. You can also consider taking an uber to the grocery store, using the ATA bus, or getting a bicycle (claflin is a tough road to bike, though).\n\nSome grocery stores also offer free delivery if you buy a certain amount. HyVee does it, not sure about dillons. If you find a roommate with a car, you might be able to plan your shopping trips together.\n\nWal-Mart is probably the cheapest groceries, but it's not that big of a difference.\n\nGramarcy apartments are pre-furnished and across the street from the football stadium, which are selling points for a lot of people. The place never gets cleaned up, trash everywhere, pool is gross, and the furniture they provide is junk. They've had problems with roaches too.\n\nI never had any issues with my place at the district. The A.C. broke a few times but they didn't drag their feet on fixing it. 90% or more of the residents are college kids, so there is often party noise on the weekends, but it never bothered me.Again, different ownership now, things might be different. \n\n\nDorms are a solid choice too. Didn't live in them myself, but had lots of friends who did. Best way to meet new people and make some friends, but you'll have to share a room with someone and there's a communal bathroom for an entire floor wing.",

    "postText": "Hello KSU!\n\nI'm a senior at Oklahoma State University, getting a degree in Multimedia Journalism. Currently I'm working on a documentary about some of the major issues students have with OSU, and one of the topics that came up is parking. So I had a few questions to help compare opinions of parking at the various Big 12 Schools since our parking director made several references to it. So I had some questions I was hoping I could get responses on!\n\n------------------\n\nHere they are:\n\n* What is YOUR opinion on parking at your school? What do you think the opinion is of parking in general?\n* What do you think of how much parking costs? From what I can tell your school's residential permits cost $180. Ours cost $103.\n* Do you find it difficult to find parking at any time? I imagine this is a common feeling among a lot of larger universities.\n* An opinion from our parking director is \"OSU doesn't have a parking problem, OSU has a walking problem\". Do you think there is a similar opinion at KSU?\n* Is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\n-----------------------\n\nIn the past I've interviewed students during our football semester and I know the opinions were not great for parking on campus, especially during the weekends of gameday.\n\nThank you a ton if you help me with this! Have a good rest of your semester too (someone send help, senior year is hard).",

Even less spaces now with all the construction going on.\n\n&gt;What do you think of how much parking costs? From what I can tell your school's residential permits cost $180. Ours cost $103.\n\nFar too expensive.\n\n&gt;Do you find it difficult to find parking at any time? I imagine this is a common feeling among a lot of larger universities.\n\nLiterally impossible to find a spot between 9:30-11:00ish, clears up later on in the afternoon. You basically have to either get there very early, very late, or park off campus. \n\n&gt;An opinion from our parking director is \"OSU doesn't have a parking problem, OSU has a walking problem\". Do you think there is a similar opinion at KSU?\n\nI'm not sure of the stance of the parking officials, but I'd assume they see no problem since people are buying parking passes anyways.\n\n&gt;Is there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nGenerally there's a lot more parking for \"W\" passes which are teachers/staff. There's also \"T\" parking which is for both student and staff. Then there's \"O\" parking which is supposed to be just for students. Essentially, I see people with \"W\" tags in our \"O\" spots all the time and not getting ticketed, while you'll most definitely get a ticket if you park in a \"W\" spot with an \"O\" tag, so there's that bullshit. \n\nIn summary, parking fucking sucks.

I don't really see anything wrong with it, nor do I usually see them in our lots actually. But I can't think of any student cases thus far where they parked in the staff lot (unless it was from earlier this school year after several lots were changed without major awareness).\n\nThus far, I don't think there are many major universities with students very happy with the parking situations. \"Fun\" little situation.",

I get an hour lunch break most days, and that's still not enough time to leave campus and find parking when I get back.\n\nWe pay for our permits on a sliding scale based on salary. I'm on the low end of the pay scale, and my permit is about $200 a year. If I wanted a reserved space, or a space in the parking garage, it would cost me around $400 a year. If I got a raise, those prices would go up. They're actually going up every year anyway, but we don't get raises so our paychecks are actually shrinking.\n\nIf the campus plan is implemented like they say it's going to be, I will probably only be purchasing a parking pass for maybe another year. They keep taking away parking on campus, and are expecting us to park in the stadium lots (which are a good 2 miles away, at least) and ride a freaking bus. If our staff IDs will get us on the buses regardless of whether or not we have a parking pass, then why even buy a pass? We live outside of town (housing is too expensive in Manhattan, it's cheaper to live 20 miles away and commute) so we'll still have to park somewhere, but if we can't park within a 10-15 minute walk of where we work then what's the point of paying for parking?",

I've seen cars waiting for spots in the engineering lot just sit forever, hoping that someone comes out to leave.\n\nFrom what I've heard, the administration's goal is to beef up public transit, and shrink parking until there are just a few lots around, and then have people bus around between those. They just removed a parking lot to build a new residence complex, and they also pulled out some road for a \"pedestrian mall\" which so far has been largely blocked off for construction trucks.\n\nPersonally, I live right near campus, so I walk/bike everywhere and parking/traffic doesn't really affect me very much, except that people desperate for spots often park in my complex's reserved parking lot.\n\nI had an econ professor who wanted them to raise the price of parking until demand was low enough that there wasn't a scarcity of space anymore. Kinda shitty, but in theory it works.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

(just piecing together and comparing what I have seen here to what others have said about their \"there\"s. Our lots are often full, causing would-be parkers to leave for another lot or try to \"get creative\" (often resulting in a ticket!) btw, I despise our parking service ticket writers, they are malicious and quick to make life tough for visitors, people with recently expired tags, freshmen moving in, etc.\n\n\n-The tickets could be cheaper, the passes could be cheaper, BOTH could be cheaper (especially if we cut spending. For example, we could have NOT renovated the Vanier Football complex in 2007 and instead used the $8 million to cut the price of parking passes and tickets in half for the next 300 years. :P Haha, but it could be worse.\n\n\n-Most hassle can be avoided if you show up 10 minutes before the class-rush or do something else adaptive. There are some evens like department meetings where suddenly 300 students are suddenly trying to use the lot where it kindof gets overrun...? Still, if you *really* want to drive, not walk, you can find a way to park relatively closely to most any building.\n\n\n-I think more students here should walk, however, the people who don't walk think that they shouldn't have to walk. ;) So everyone views their own ways as \"the right ways.\" What's new haha.\n\n\n-I'd like to reiterate my passionate frustration with campus parking services. I dislike them more than Isis. Its their job to leave $50 \"surprises\" for students and they take ruining peoples' days very lightly.\n\nGood luck with you Documentary!

From what I can tell your school's residential permits cost $180. Ours cost $103.\n\nCurrent regular parking permits are around $200. Reserved ones are around $850\n\n&gt; Do you find it difficult to find parking at any time? I imagine this is a common feeling among a lot of larger universities.\n\nParking is really difficult during peak times\n\n&gt; An opinion from our parking director is \"OSU doesn't have a parking problem, OSU has a walking problem\". Do you think there is a similar opinion at KSU?\n\nThis is similar to the issue we are facing. When the university needs new buildings they have to be built closer to other buildings, since students have only  10 minute travel time in between classes. The current issue has less to do with not enough parking, its more to do with not having a reliable shuttle and extensive shuttle system. It is physically impossible to have enough parking for everyone in the middle of the campus (without building huge parking garages), but if you have big satellite parking lots and a good shuttle system to connect them to the campus, the issue could be solved. This is what the university is trying to do with the master plan, but with current state budget cuts it will take a very long time to implement this.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nCheck the [campus master plan](http://www.k-state.edu/facilities/projects/planning/master_plans/2025_plan/K-State%20Campus%20MP%20Report_v13_FINAL.pdf).",

I would almost always get first to third row parking for my morning classes (I would arrive on campus around 8 a.m. for an 8:30 and park in Weber) and 75% of the time get the parking garage for my mid-morning classes (I'd be driving up to the garage around 9:35-9:40 for a 10:30 class). If I didn't get the garage I would park at old stadium and not even try to find a spot in the O lot, I went straight for W (At least I believe that's the correct lot, clear in the back on the left).\n\nI was able to get garage spots easily because I timed entering campus at the same time that students were leaving the garage after class, while this plan won't work every semester it did for my last two. \n\nMy only suggestion/complaint is I would have liked there to be a system indicating how full a lot or the garage is, such as, instead of the garage saying open for students have it color coated on remaining spots. (ie. green for everything down to 30 spots, yellow solid for 30-10 spots, and yellow flashing down to like 3 spots and red after that). The numbers an be changed to better fit the amount of parking and demand but it'd be nice to just have some kind of indicator on how full an area is/if there is open parking at all.",

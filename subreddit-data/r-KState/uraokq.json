Does anyone know of any K State programs, interesting classes, training courses, books, or anything which can be paid for out of a student account? Are dorms paid out of a student account? Can Jardine apartments be paid through a student account? I have questions",

They will be able to tell you how you can use the funds. For classes, maybe look at a foreign language class. I always found those fun and the entry level courses are pretty easy.",

We are a small and new sub trying to increase K-State\u2019s presence on Reddit by providing a more active community. \n\nWith your help we hope to make r/KStateWildcats the place for fans to have fun and discuss K-State athletics, football, basketball, news, and more. Help us reach our goal of **1000 members** by the time football season starts next fall. We hope that you will consider being an early member. Thank you and Go Cats!\n\nLink: [https://www.reddit.com/r/KStateWildcats](https://www.reddit.com/r/KStateWildcats)",

I think that it is important for students to have a sub where they can discuss and ask questions related to school  \nand campus life (this sub).\u00a0   \nFans of K-State athletics not only includes this group, but other groups including alumni or people who may not have attended K-State.\u00a0 This seems to be pretty common among other schools in our conference:   \nr/cyclONEnation vs r/iastate  \nr/mountaineers vs r/WVU  \nr/LonghornNation vs r/UTAustin  \nr/jayhawks vs r/UniversityofKansas",

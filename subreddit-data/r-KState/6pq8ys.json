    "postText": "I am in search for a sublease for my apartment starting August 1st, 2017.\nThe name is University Crossing apartments located at 2215 College Ave. Manhattan, Kansas 66502.  It\u2019s located just a walking distance away from the Bill Snyder Family football stadium. The rent rate would be $299 a month for a 4BD or $429 a month for a 2BD and the lease ends on August 1st, 2018.  The only utilities that you will be responsible for is electricity and water.  The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable and internet.  If you would like wireless internet you are responsible for providing your own router.  Another great thing about subleasing is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my subleasor and you can move into any apartment within the complex.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact me at stephen.osborne91@gmail.com.  \n\nAmenities that they offer are listed below.  \n24-hour Fitness Center\n24-hour Computer Lab with FREE Printing \nWasher &amp; Dryer in each unit\nFree Tanning\nBasketball Court\nTennis Court\nOutdoor, in-ground Pool\nClubhouse including Pool Table and TV (cable provided)\nPatio Area with Barbecue Grill\nOn-Site Management &amp; Maintenance\nIndividual Leasing\nFully Furnished Apartments\nOn-Site Parking\nRoommate Matching Service\nFree Shuttle Service to Kansas State University\nFree Coffee Bar located in the Leasing Office\n ",

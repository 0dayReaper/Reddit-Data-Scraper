    "postText": "Has anyone taken a CLEP exam for K-State credit? I need a couple more hours (that I wasn't planning on) to graduate in December. I'm considering just testing out of something uber easy like college algebra, since it's only $85. \n\nI've never taken one before and the girl I talked to in the registrars office didn't sound super confident in the info she gave me. Help.",

            "comment": "I took the CLEP for credit back in 2013, so I'm not sure if it's changed, but it was relatively easy to pass.  I hadn't taken any advanced/ap/college algebra, I just reviewed some stuff from the prep questions on their website (I think) and passed.  If it's still the same setup, you have to get 50 or higher (it's not out of 100).  It tells you your score immediately after you take it so you know when you leave if you passed or failed.  Since I didn't actually take a class in high school, there were definitely a few higher level questions I didn't know how to do.  However, these only made up maybe 20% of the questions and even if you miss those, you can still pass.  I'd recommend going through what's going to be on the test (their website I think will have minimal info, but enough for you to gauge) and if you feel like you know some of it, go for it.  Other than looking through some example questions I didn't study really at all and was fine.  It's also way easier than any standardised test or AP test.\n\nTldr; even if you never took a higher level algebra class, you'll likely still know a good chunk of it.  You don't necessarily have to know the advanced stuff since that only comes up on a chunk of the test.  ",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I'm gearing up to watch what should be an entertaining Liberty Bowl this weekend and I thought I'd take it upon myself to propose a bet with you guys. The community of /r/Razorbacks is always open to friendly wagers and one thing we've tried to do a couple of times is a bet in which the losing subreddit changes the style of their page for a week. For example, if we lost, we'd probably change our logo to your colors or switch out the sidebar picture with something y'all vote on. If we win, y'all could change the purple header to red (or something like that).\n\nWith it being this close to the game, I thought I'd propose this bet here for your users and mods to discuss. If that sounds good to y'all and a mod wants to make the bet, just let me know here so I can pass it on to our other mods or just send the mods of /r/razorbacks a message yourself.\n\nGood luck to you guys! Maybe I just might see some of y'all there on Saturday!",

Wildcat  Creek has batting cages and it supposed to be beautiful this weekend so outdoors will be fun. \n\n\nThe evening I would go to little apple brewery or Tallgrass tap house to eat both are excellent.  Star gazing on the konza is always fun and Manhattan Hill is fun for a sunset. \n\n\nLittle apple lanes is fun for bowling and the Union is fun for bowling pool and billiards \n\n",

Was wondering about some cool things to do/see while we are out there? Any good restaurants? Nightlife? Tailgating tips? (Are spots hard to come by on game day, etc.)\n\nWould appreciate any help! ",

Is it first come first serve or do you need to buy a pass beforehand? Also, I am assuming aggieville is the place to be for the younger crowd? \n\nCant wait to visit Manhattan. We have been to Norman, Lawrence, and Ames so really looking forward to visiting Manhattan this year. I am sure it'll be one of the better trips we end up taking while in school. ",

If you get there in the first hour though you should get a decent place.\n\nAfter the game, definitely go to Aggieville. All kinds of bars for all kinds of people. Johnny Kaws, Tubby's, and Kites are gonna be the bigger party bars with Hip hop or house music. Taco Lucha, So Long Saloon, Auntie Mae's Parlor, and Keltic Star are going to be more lowkey, quiet, atmosphere type bars. But honestly they're all so close together (And some partially attached to other bars) that it really doesn't matter. If you don't like the bar finish your drink and move on. ",

For a little lower price than H, Bourbon and Baker is a another great dinner option (same owners actually).  B&amp;B pours a good drink and has delicious small plates for sharing!  Little Apple Brewing Company has good beer and very good food and a flexible price range - you could have a beer and a burger/sandwich for &lt;$15 or splurge with a steak and salad bar.  This is my fifth year in this town and those are three of my favorites and uniquely Manhattan.  Harry's takes reservations and if you have 8 or more LAbco will take reservations.  Most other places don't, so expect a wait (especially at places in Aggieville).\n\nAnd FYI, the food truck mentioned in another post is only open at night.  I think it's 10:30-2 or 3 Thurs-Sat.  And get your mac n cheese grilled cheese with bacon.  Worth the extra $1 every time.\n\nI'd recommend bomb bar for one of your stops on your path of drinking :)",

Varsity truck doesn't close until 3:00 AM. \n\nA cool thing to check out would be Manhattan Hill, if you're into that. It overlooks pretty much all of Manhattan and is really cool to go at night. \n\nIn terms of food, Hunam Express has cheap Chinese food that is pretty good, and Cozy's has slider's that are really good. Otherwise, literally anywhere else in Aggieville.\n\nAs everybody else said, AGGIEVILLE. Go there, there is plenty of stuff to do there.",

My major is HR with a CATS minor if that helps any! My advisor gave me suggestions like boxing and wine tasting but I would prefer online/distance classes. \n\nThanks in advance! C:",

My major is also interior design so I am biased on design lol. But it was very easy  and the professor was nice. I would also suggest Gender Issues in the Workplace (PSYCH 563). Im in it currently as an 8 week online course and its been pretty easy and very enjoyable! Its a pretty interesting class.",

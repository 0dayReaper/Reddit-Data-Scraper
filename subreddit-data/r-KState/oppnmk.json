    "postText": "I'm strongly considering attending Kansas State, but I have a couple important questions: \n\nWith this being such a large school, do the professors actually care about students and try building connections? Or are they mainly focused on their own research instead?\n\nI'm also concerned that Kansas is quite a bit more conservative than the state I live in now, and I'm not sure if being gay would cause any issues for me or if I would have to hide that part of myself at Kansas State.\n\nThank you for any help!!",

I would put money on it. Kstate is conservative at times but if someone made you feel unsafe, they would be the problem in the eyes of the campus. Not you.",

            "comment": "I've known a few out gay people at K-State.  There was actually a good example where a K-State football player (Frantz) came out during playing and I felt like it was received well, helped he was a great lineman. Don't get me wrong, there are going to be fuckknobs that aren't cool, and you'll find plenty that still use \"gay\" or the F variant as a synonym for dumb or as a low key insult, but the community is pretty accepting and you WILL find allies.\n\n\n\nProfs can be cool.  I find often times you need to work the relationship to get results.  But if you do the work it has dividends.",

            "comment": "Junior at KSU here! As far as professors caring about students, it really just depends on the professor. I\u2019ve had some professors that go out of their way to make sure you\u2019re okay if you don\u2019t show up for a couple days, and I\u2019ve also had professors that I feel would sell me to Satan for a single corn chip. I\u2019m a Park Management student with a minor in Entomology, and I feel that the majority of my professors in my areas of study have been good. \n\nAs far as being queer at Kansas State, I\u2019m asexual panromantic, but I\u2019m in a hetero-passing relationship. However, I do \u201clook kinda queer\u201d (360 undercut, occasionally colored hair, gauges, tattoos, backwards hat on a female, etc), and I\u2019ve never gotten any trouble about it. I\u2019ve also seen openly gay people and have never seen or heard of there being problems with them either. For the most part, I\u2019d consider KSU to be LGBTQ+ safe.",

I consider that incident an anomaly fueled by a night in Aggieville and would imagine that the environment is much more welcoming than it was 12 years ago. I also still have relationships with the professors who I grew close to while there. A few of them really took me under their wing and supported me through some really tough times. K-State is a great place and they take the \"Family\" motto pretty seriously. When I run in to someone wearing a KSU shirt where I live we always have something to chat about and I always come away feeling like I met a long lost friend.",

There were always the random nights at a bar where people questioned which bathroom I went into or the gender marker on my ID at the door, but that has happened to me at bars in liberal cities too - it's happened more times than I can remember. But honestly, outside of the bar scene, I had a really nice experience there.\n\nKSU won't be a beacon of LGBTQ acceptance, but you'll be fine.",

With all our conservative flaws, I would say we are definitely a safe campus for LGBTQ+ people.",

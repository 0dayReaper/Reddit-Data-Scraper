We upgraded all Derby dorms to have new APs in each room so you should have reliable wireless and wired connections. Wi-Fi will still take a hit during peak hours.\n\nNote: Off campus is still better. No monitoring of network traffic and choose your own speeds.",

Wireless was pretty meh and shotty in my room. If you want really good internet I would say Jardine. It's where I spent my last 3 years and while the wireless is still about the same (shotty with meh speed) wired connection is amazing. 70mb/s dl like 50 upload. If you got any other questions just ask",

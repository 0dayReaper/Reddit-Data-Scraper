    "postText": " I'm in the area for about 10 weeks for a summer job and after a 12-hour car drive and unpacking most of the day, I walked y'alls' campus. I'm honestly really jealous of how green and scenic the whole campus is and how the architecture blends together unlike A&amp;M ([here's an example of one of our eyesores lol](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3f/bb/b1/3fbbb163edc3640f2c6b14b65dc86156.jpg)). Anyways, I only really know people in the place I'm staying and at my job, so if y'all have any recommendations on where to eat or would like to hang out, please let me know! I really want to try and storm chase and would love to get a group together since it makes it safer and more enjoyable. I also tried looking for discords to join for people in the area, but most of them had invalid links or were for classes and it would be awkward to join one.\n\nTLDR; Y'all have a super pretty campus to be proud of and I am excited to stay here over the summer!",

Taco Lucha next door has amazing tacos. Ajs pizza down on Poyntz is super good and has a pretty big outdoor eating area. And although they're known for pizza, they make one of the best chicken parm sandwiches I've ever had. Tallgrass brewring company is a good micro brewery and restaurant, and Manhattan Brewring Company is a brewery only but have really good beers! There are plenty of other places here that are super good but these are my favorites. I hope you enjoy your time in Manhattan!",

            "comment": "Great places to eat in aggieville: taco lucha get the raspberry bean dip and a Nancy all the tacos are great the poppers are also great. So long saloon get the Austin style chilichese dip. And the peanut butter burger. \nThe hi low is pretty good but I haven't been there enough to give you a hard recommendation there. Rock a belly deli it's just great I usually get the belly buster or the western get a summer beer to drink. Nicos is a newer place but last time i was there it was great if you like Italian food.\nVarsity donuts has fun donuts but the star is the food truck they have on the weekends after like 10pm corndogs are good but the grilled cheese Mac and cheese and a bacon bomb is a killer combo after a night drinking\n Goolsbys is a pretty fun place to hang do some mini bowling and some pour your own beers \n\nNow on to poyntz\nAj's pizza is excellent and the pepperoni bricks and dessert knots are fire. Bourbon and baker is a bit pricey compared to other places around but good lord it's awesome it's tapas style so you will order 2-3 dishes per person make sure one of those is the brussel sprouts they are life changing. The taphouse is in my opinion the most overrated place in town but it's still very good I like the fried chicken sandwich tossed in the sauce for the Korean wings. The chef is hands down the best breakfast place I get the chicken fried steak and eggs with hash browns and toast but I've had every entree there and liked them all. El patron is a bit more upscale Mexican food it's great get the elote dip. Arrow cocktail lounge has some crazy cocktails and a bit more chill vibe. And little batch bakery does breakfast sometimes on the weekends it's a nice treat. There is also wine and dive it's good but I don't think it's as good as the price but their brunch is reasonable. Mhk brewing has great beers and you can order food from any of those other places and eat it in there. \n\nIf you like coffee bluestem, radinas, and arrow coffee are all good calls.\n\nSome places off the beaten path would be call hall for ice cream. guilty biscuit has some great food but I think they are only open on the weekends. And the little grill which is a Jamaican place and the owner who was Jamaican just passed recently. Mr. Ks get the cookie bake. There is a Mexican food truck by la fiesta that has some great stuff. Baan Thai has some good Thai food. Vista burger is our home town greasy spoon. And ana's burger shack was damn fine last time I was there.  We also have cox bbq but it's nothing special if you want great bbq head to kc and go to any of those famous places.\n\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list it's just the things I could think of off the top of my head.",

Plus, when I visited, everyone was so incredibly friendly. And who can beat Miss Rev (and her Insta?) \ud83d\udc36 Fun fact, the current Miss Rev from a breeder in Topeka, Kansas.\n3. Try Rock A Belly Deli in Aggieville for a good sandwich! It's been a Manhattan staple for decades. It's in Aggieville right across from campus.\n4. I hope you enjoy your stay in Manhattan as much as I have enjoyed my visits to College Station and I hope you find the people to be equally friendly!",

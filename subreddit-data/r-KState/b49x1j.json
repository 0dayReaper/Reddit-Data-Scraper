Pullen has been quoted many times saying that it\u2019s hard to schedule because he wants so many people there that helped him along the way and Frank is one of them. \n\nHe is actively still coaching and unless KState plays SC it would be hard pressed to get him to take time away from his current program to focus on another. \n\nI also think KSU doesn\u2019t want to do it at a chump game which makes the above even harder.

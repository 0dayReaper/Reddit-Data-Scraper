I'm not sure how much stuff there is on campus to hold an 8 year old's interest. In addition to the union there is the new engineering building that is all shiny and stuff. You can walk around the back of Ward hall and see where the nuclear reactor is. Don't think you can go in and see it though. I think they do tours during open house though. Cardwell hall has an observatory dome on the roof and is where physics and math are. But again, you could probably just see boring lecture halls while walking through on a weekend. ",

It\u2019s in the KSU Gardens.\n\nThis isn\u2019t directly KSU, but another idea would be to take him to the Flint Hills Discovery Museum. Opened here like 5ish years ago, super neat and kid friendly while still science-y.\n\nThe Dusty Bookshelf in Aggieville\u2019s still closed after the fire last year so that\u2019s a bummer.\n\nI like science and books too, he sounds like a cool kid :)",

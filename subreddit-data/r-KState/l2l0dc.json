    "postText": "Has anyone here studied math with Prof. Gabriel Nagy?\n\nI've read some chapters from his [Real Analysis notes](https://www.math.ksu.edu/~nagy/real-an/) and found them superbly written.\n\nI'd like to read his notes for chapter VI \"Product Spaces\", which unfortunately are not available on the page linked to above. I tried to contact him directly, but he hasn't replied.\n\nDoes anyone here happen to have these notes and can make them available to me?\n\nEDIT: Prof. Nagy has responded to my email by sending me his hand-written notes of the missing chapter. So kind of him! I can't wait to read them.",

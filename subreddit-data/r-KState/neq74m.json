How do fraternities work?  \nDo most people live on the campus or outside?  \nIs it cheaper to live in dorms or apartments?  \nIs anyone allowed to use the gyms, tennis courts, pool, etc?  \nWhat's the best way to make friends?  \nIs it easy to get a job on campus?  \nHow are parties like?  \nAre most people from around Kansas?  \nAny tips I should know before attending?\n\n  \nThank you!",

            "comment": "I graduate a few years ago so take what I say with a grain of salt. \r  \n1.\tAs a member of a fraternity at KSU I can tell that I had a very positive experience. Ignore common \u201cstereotypes\u201d that you hear about each house and make your own decision. I genuinely think that most chapters are melting pots of a lot of people with varying degrees of partying, academics, religion, and political views.\r  \n2.\tFraternities at KSU do informal recruiting. Meaning there is no official \u2018rush week\u2019 as the sororities do at K-State. Recruiting chairs for each house will hold events and even 1 on 1 sessions to get to know people and if they like you they\u2019ll extend you a bid. Basically an invite to begin the process of joining their fraternity. There is no obligation to join after receiving a bid. \r  \n3.\tA lot of underclassmen live on campus and move off campus as they get older. Off campus is cheaper but understandably a little more difficult to get involved with university groups, clubs, etc. Not impossible but you aren\u2019t pushed into it like you are when you live on campus. At least when I was  at KSU living in a fraternity was cheaper than the dorms because a meal plan and boarding is all included in your membership dues (There are other fees that come along ie parties, philanthropy donations, t-shirts, potential fines. Etc.) but each chapter is unique it that aspect. And the cost varies from chapter to chapter.\r  \n4.\tAll active students have admission to the rec center.\r  \n5.\tBoth on Campus and off campus jobs are readily available. Lots of service positions in a college town (cashier, waiter/bartender, etc.) but also plenty of opportunities to work in campus facilities (paid tutor, office aide, landscaping, for KSU)\r  \n6.\tParties cover the whole spectrum. I\u2019ve seen some really crazy parties with hundreds of people, and I\u2019ve been to plenty of parties with a dozen people just hanging out. Totally depends on your friend group and who you surround yourself with.\r  \n7.\tI would say the vast majority of students are from Kansas. Mostly Wichita, Kansas City Metro, and Rural Kansas, with the remaining being out of staters.\r  \n8.\t The tip I would give you is to not be afraid to reach out to representative of the university. Whether it be people in the admissions office, office of fraternity and sorority life, even department heads of the major you plan on studying. People are really nice and really willing to help. Manhattan is the happiest place on earth for a reason!",

            "comment": "&gt;\tAny tips I should know before attending?\n\nI\u2019ll answer this one since other people have chimed in: go to class! I was a terrible college student; graduated with a really low GPA, skipped a lot of classes, put in minimal effort into homework, and barely got by. I\u2019m still proud that I graduated but if I could do college again, I\u2019d do it completely different. If you\u2019re enrolled in school, go to school. Get your partying out during the summer and weekends. \n\nManhattan is a special place, I do miss it often. I met my wife there, I met some of my closest lifelong friends there, and it was an amazing six years living in Manhattan (like I said, I was a bad student). But remember that college is the reason you\u2019re there, so don\u2019t neglect it. Use tutors if you need them, use the library, use all of the resources available to you. That was my biggest issue; I was afraid to reach out for help when I needed it. If I would have just swallowed my pride and asked for help, it would have been way different. But remember that the people at K-State want you to be successful, so use those resources. \n\nAlso, Aggieville is a magical place. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like now, but when I was in Manhattan there was plenty of live music, stand up, and just fun stuff happening every weekend.",

            "comment": "\r\rI've answered your questions that apply to my experience at KSU. Graduated 2019\n\nDo most people live on the campus or outside? - **I lived in dorms my first year and off campus after. I prefer off camps for a number of reasons: cheaper, I make the rules, I have my own bathroom and bedroom, I have an actual kitchen, no curfew, etc. There are a few off-campus apartments like the UC that are student based housing - they also help with roommates if need - they  have great amenities and pool parties. I can't tell you how many drunken activities I've been to there. And it's right next to the stadium.** \r  \n\rIs anyone allowed to use the gyms, tennis courts, pool, etc? -**yes and no. You have to have a student ID to get into the rec, you can bring guests but I think there is a cost for them. But generally, anyone can use any of the city parks - Cico, City and (I think) Anneberg park all have tennis courts. And a lot of college kids go to City Park because it's right by Aggieville.** \r  \nWhat's the best way to make friends? -**I made a couple friends in the dorms, but most of my college friends I made through my job. Even if you don't need a job, maybe consider getting one for extra cash and meeting people. I worked at Longhorn Steakhouse - a lot of college kids work serving jobs.** \r  \nIs it easy to get a job on campus? -**for me it wasn't easy at all to find a job on campus, but I held jobs at Journeys, Texas Roadhouse and Dillards in addition to LH.** \r  \nHow are parties like? **- from my experience, usually if you are not in a frat they will not let you in a frat party as a dude - I'm a woman though so I haven't had that problem. Other parties are fun af - especially Fake Patties Day, after football games, etc. Aggieville is a popular party spot.** \r  \nAre most people from around Kansas? -**Yes and no. I'm from Manhattan, but I met people from alllll over the world. Mostly other kansans though lol** \r  \nAny tips I should know before attending? -**Don't be afraid to make friends - most likely everyone else would love a new friend. Don't be afraid to ask questions in class, most likely everyone is wondering the same thing. Get involved on campus if you can, this helps make friends and possibly build your resume.**",

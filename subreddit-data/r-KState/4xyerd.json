They are thinking of getting a hotel for the night. I was thinking it might be fun to stay at the Bluemont with my fianc\u00e9. Any tips for graduation night, where to go, what people usually do? Thanks in advance for any advice to help me plan this exciting night that is just around the corner! :)",

As for what to do, the city will be as crowded as it is during a big football game, all the big places will be crowded. Manhattan Hill is a pretty popular place to get pictures taken, tons of people will be getting pics taken around campus as well. ",

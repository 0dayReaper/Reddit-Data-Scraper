Came back after an hour and it was gone.\n\nI believe whatever bikes that get recovered and never claimed get auctioned off.\n\nI suggest if you get a replacement or recover it, buy one of those thick metal ropes with a U shaped style lock. That way you can go through the frame and wheels together so it's more difficult to steal.",

I just did the old \"Oh, forgot the keys, 30 minutes for lunch won't be bad...\" Mostly joking, but is there any legal standing for someone to set up a \"sting\" to get proof? We're going to blow this bicycle theft ring wide open!",

            "comment": "MHK has a theft problem. I have had my bike stolen, my car and my house broken into. The bike was chained up. The car was unlocked and they stole the change from the cup holder and made a mess of my glovebox. The house was pretty fucked up. They kicked in the back door that led to the alley.  3 laptops 1 x-box 1 TV and a bunch of textbooks and shit was stolen. (There were 4 of us living there). They got caught. After about a year the police let us pick new laptops and a new xBox from the unclaimed stolen items. I ended up with a much better laptop than my original. \n\nSo my advice. Get a big ass lock for your bike. Spend the $10 a month for renters insurance. Take pictures of everything over $20 and email them to your insurance agent. Then create a google drive and upload the pictures there for safe keeping. \n",

Kelby will hook you up with a used bike for cheap or sell you your stolen one  back for like a 30 dollar fee. Lock your fuckin bike up dipshit or I can promise you it will be sold to the next schmuck that walks into Kelby\u2019s Bike Shop. The deals are out of this world and it\u2019s the only way to buy a bike these days in my opinion.",

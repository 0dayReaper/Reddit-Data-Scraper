My sister and I did this back in the late 80s. \nThere was a storage room in the freshman lab room in the vet school that had a full-term human baby in formaldehyde. This was also 1989, and no one was going to bring their camera to school and then take pics to be developed at 1 Hour Photo.",

I would not recommend it though because there is a shaft inside that sinks 150 feet down to the base of the hill. You'll fall and die and they won't find your bones for decades. Which is why I won't divulge specifics about how to get inside.\n\n\nBy the way, the cistern is the concrete slab off in the forest, behind the letters, and sunk into the ground a bit. I'm not talking about the water tower. From the surface, it just looks like a concrete slab, but there's a whole chamber inside which used to hold the entire city's water supply a century ago.",

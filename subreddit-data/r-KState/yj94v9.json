For example, I will root against KU sports teams pretty much always, but I will cheer for the achievements of their academic departments. Each school is renowned for their educational offerings. K-State is an amazing Ag School and KU is a great Medical school. Keep the rivalries friendly.",

I didn't recognize him, but my mom pointed him out. I didn't know it was a tradition for him. I'm gonna have to tell my mom now. Assuming she still remembers seeing Snyder at Taco Bell 20 years ago...",

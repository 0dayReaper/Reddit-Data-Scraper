    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nWe are the Chapman Center for Rural Studies at Kansas State University. We are interested in understanding how Kansans respond to different kinds of voices.\n\nTo participate in this study, you must be an English speaker who is over the age of 18 and was born and raised in Kansas. You must also have normal hearing (no hearing aids, cochlear implants, or the like) and have headphones to complete this task. Additionally, this task works best if completed on a computer.\n\nIf you complete the survey, you will be eligible to win a $50 Amazon gift card. Right now, we estimate that your chance of winning a gift card is around 1/30. Also, if you refer an eligible friend, and that friend completes the survey as well, you will receive a guaranteed $5 Amazon gift card via a referral code within a week of completion.\n\nSo, if you have around 20 minutes to spare, if you meet the qualifications listed above, and if you want the chance to win a $50 Amazon gift card, please feel free to check out the link below!\n\nWe really appreciate your participation!\n\nHere is the link to the study, which also outlines the study, reiterates participant eligibility, and explains a few other things as well: [https://research.sc/participant/login/dynamic/38A5A0F9-3B3C-42E1-A401-E3C89F078768?fbclid=IwAR2Bww411EaErXAjO\\_002S8\\_YmuqVa9CJgcbTufPGYfAoDPelFyo-MGbE\\_Y](https://research.sc/participant/login/dynamic/38A5A0F9-3B3C-42E1-A401-E3C89F078768?fbclid=IwAR2Bww411EaErXAjO_002S8_YmuqVa9CJgcbTufPGYfAoDPelFyo-MGbE_Y)\n\nThanks!\n\nThe Chapman Center for Rural Studies",

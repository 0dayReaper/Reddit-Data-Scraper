            "comment": "Welcome to K-State!\n\nI\u2019d say in general, it\u2019s easier to make friends in the residence halls, since everyone is in closer proximity and you\u2019re more likely to run into each other. Since you\u2019re coming in as a transfer student though, you might not be as interested in that \u201ctraditional college freshman experience\u201d. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d say Wefald would be a good place - it\u2019s new, a little unique in design compared from others (kitchen on every floor, individual bathrooms but shared with others, more nooks to sit and hang out in). But there are other great dorms too. I think Marlatt and Goodnow have a chill but fun vibe. Putnam and Van Zile seem to have a close, tight knit community feel. I\u2019ve heard good things about West too.\n\nJardine apartments are a little more of a walk from where classes will be, but not much, and there\u2019s a shuttle you can take too. The numbered buildings (1-13) are pretty nice, and some are in really cool neighborhoods that overlook a nice pond area. 14-16 are the newest and are really nice and have a good amount of space. The lettered buildings (like S, V) are older and a bit smaller with not quite as nice kitchens, but a lot have been renovated recently and might have nicer interiors now. They can still have a cozy atmosphere though if you set them up right. In all apartments, you\u2019ll have to pay for electricity but I\u2019m pretty sure the rest of the utilities and campus internet (which is pretty good now) are included.\n\nI\u2019d say go the dorms if you want to be forced to meet people, but if you\u2019ve already got friends established or don\u2019t want to be with primarily freshmen/sophomores and want more privacy, go for the apartments. Hope that helps some, let me know if you have questions!\n\nedit: just read you\u2019re a chem major, so most of your classes will probably be on the east side of campus. VanZile, Putnam, West, and the other Derby dorms are closer, but still not a far walk from the dorms on the west side like Marlatt, Goodnow, Wefald. From Jardine, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a 20 minute walk, or &lt;5 minutes walk from where the shuttle drops you off at.",

Jardine has unrenovated tonfully renovated students, you have to apply within a certain time frame and if I'm correct you need to be a nontraditional student. \nDorm I would assume you share your space and are right on campus depending which down with quicker access to food halls and such. Regardless Jardine is still very close.",

It\u2019s predominantly freshman and sophomores, and sometimes it can be kind of annoying. \n\nI would recommend either Jardine or living off campus.",

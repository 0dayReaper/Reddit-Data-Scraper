But I am working now and I would prefer somewhere a little more quiet.  I tried /r/littleapple already, but kstate seems to have better traffic.   Thanks for your help! ",

It lies 0.7 Mile West of Campus (I walk to/from class round trip once or twice a day) The community is composed almost entirely of athletes, rich exchange students from Asia, and Engineerings. Its not a downtown penthouse community by any means, but all are a bit older, calmer, and have their act together a bit more than the average college population IMO.",

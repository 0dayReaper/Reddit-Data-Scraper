If your resume says you have a degree from ku or ksu every employer in the country will be familiar with your school and know your degree is from a quality institution.\n\nIf your degree is from FHSU or one of the other small schools in the state employers in most of the country will have never heard of it.  If they've never heard of it they will quite possibly assume it isn't a great school.\n\nThis is only one factor to keep in mind, and I'm sure others on here will bring up lots of other important factor.  It is one thing is keep in mind though.",

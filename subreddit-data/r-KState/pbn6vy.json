    "postText": "Hi, all.\nI'm looking for suggestions for my daughter who's a freshman this Fall. She's living in the dorms but works off campus until 10pm most nights, and hasn't felt safe walking the 20 plus minutes from the only parking lot her permit allows back to her residence hall. Sometimes her phone service also seems spotty out there.  She can't be the only one with that issue.  All Parking would suggest was to call the safety line if she felt unsafe.  What have current or previous K-Staters done to resolve this issue?  Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",

            "comment": "So this is one of the biggest caveats of K-State IMHO. Your daughter is either parking in the D1 lot or by the R/Z lot next to derby, both of which are much so less than optimal at night for walking. Parking doesn't like to really help in these kinds of situations so especially with her assumedly having the R freshman parking pass I only have a few suggestions as a male junior:\n\n1. If she works during the weekend or is off campus past 5pm on Friday, the campus cops are usually done and dusted for the weekend. Parking right up at the dorm is your best bet for safety at night and will remove the risk of the long walks across the lots. The expected safe time to park without tickets would be Friday 5 pm to Monday 5 am, and I would not try to leave a car later than 5 am on a Monday. Sometimes they make rounds but in the three years I've been here I've never seen or been ticketed myself during these times. Just DON'T park in the staff parking!!! \n\n2. If she is at all close with her RA, she can definitely reach out to see if they would walk with her or if they can call another RA to help. This is a less likely option especially if it's late at night but she might be able to squeeze out a safe walking buddy. \n\n3. We have an app called Guardian that you can connect to K-State's campus which has a built in safe walk call feature. I've never personally used it but I've heard good things. You essentially call and explain where you are and they will send someone to make sure your walk is safe.\n\n4. The least likely option would be calling the parking services now/next semester and see if her time/grades here allows her to get a leveled up pass. This will most likely not happen but is always worth a shot.\n\nI always wanna try to help as much as possible with situations like these! I can't think of many more options now but those are what I've learned from experience. I believe the 5pm parking *might* work for after 5 pm on weekdays but I wouldn't trust that. My anecdotes only come from weekends. Other than calling a friend I don't believe there's a whole lot else to do about this issue though unfortunately.",

And the idea for weekend nights might help, too, if she can find a spot near her hall.  I'll pass these along. It does  seem like they'd have solutions in place, though, for such an obvious safety issue.\nHave a good evening.",

I don't remember the exact list but there's a \"point\" system to the parking tags and they all add up to determine which kind you'll get when you order a new one. Things like academic standing, years attended, student employment, and grades definitely factor in from what I've heard. Essentially all that needs to be known is that if she lives on campus next year she'll be able to park on the lot in front of the dorm. It's pretty much free for all out here and that tends to be the first thing I say to incoming freshmen asking about parking. I'd also recommend to have her check out our campus parking map to see if there's any lots that may feel safer to her!",

The walk you\u2019re talking about absolutely sucks. I would also either call a friend and frequently update them with my location. If she has an iPhone she can turn on Find My Friends and make sure someone watches her walk home there, too.",

OP just wants to make sure her daughter is safe, I think that\u2019s something that warrants concern and help from a parent.

    "postText": "Hey y'all, so I got awarded the scholarship (12k for year) on December 1, and in the letter it said that I had 2 weeks to accept/decline it. I am still undecided on where I wanna go, but I wanted to know if I accepted it, it meant they'd take it as if I'm going there 100%, or if there were no repercussions but I just had to accept or decline it before then even if I'm undecided (I emailed them about an hour ago so I should get a response by tomorrow but was just wondering if you guys knew).    \nEDIT: here is what it shows before I accept it http://imgur.com/ZqWOmKK http://imgur.com/NtSkmES",

Email them (their info is on the website, I'm on mobile or else I would find it) and they'll tell you! My rep usually gets back to me within 48 hours. ",

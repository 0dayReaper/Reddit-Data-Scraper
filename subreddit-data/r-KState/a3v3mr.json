    "postText": "I know reports are that he's said that he \"isn't interested,\" but you'd think that the university would still throw a number out there just to test the water. He seems to be a clear #1 choice among fans and boosters.\n\n\nIf the necessary support from boosters is there, which I think it is, then I could see them putting 5 years at $5-6 million a year on the table (potentially making him the highest paid coach in the Big 12). I still don't think he'll *take* it, but I think that's what they'll offer.\n\n\nOur administrators know they pretty much get one shot at getting this one right. If Venables is their guy (which I think he is), and if we have the money (which I think we do), I think they might really make an offer that size before moving on.",

We just don't need to with them. $2 million would double Littrell's salary, and $1 million would *triple* Klieman's salary. ... Not to mention that K-State would be a huge upgrade for either of them, whereas it would be a downgrade for Venables.\n\n\nFor the FCS and D2 guys, I'd think (or at least hope) they'd offer like 4 years at $2 million with a few hundred thousand in incentives and a verbal agreement that they'll renegotiate it higher after the first season if things are going well.",

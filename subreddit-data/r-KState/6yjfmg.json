    "postText": "(Xposted from r/LFG)\n\nI just got the starter set for 5e and want to try out DMing for the first time. (Module will be Lost Mine Phandelver) I've been interested in DnD for a while and want to pull the trigger and actually play instead of bingeing The Adventure Zone. \n\nI can't drive so somewhere near campus would be good for meeting. I'd be available to play weekends and maybe Fridays. Please do not answer if you aren't mostly sure you can keep the commitment, I've had 2 groups drop out in the past before even starting and it sucks. I'll start a group chat in Discord for the group.\n\nIf more info is needed just ask! ",

    "postText": "I grew up on the east coast and always dreamed of going to Virginia Tech. That dream came true in 2014. Life happened and I made the decision to leave my dream school and enlist in the Air Force. Fast forward a few years and I get stationed about 15 minutes from OU. Being a big college football fan, I started paying attention to Big12 football just due to proximity. One thing that kept coming up on the local OU radio station was how everyone\u2019s favorite road game to cover was Kansas State. Everyone talks about how amazing Manhattan is and how nice the people are. Coming from a rival school that said a lot to me. When I made the decision I was going to separate from active duty and go back to school I googled Kansas State. I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I fell in love!!! \n\nA few hours ago I got my acceptance letter. I\u2019ve got a lot of stuff to square away before moving to Manhattan this August, and I\u2019m scared to death, but I also couldn\u2019t be more excited!!! See y\u2019all soon!!",

            "comment": "Likes:\n-Nice campus\n-Nice town (friendly, pretty, large enough but still a small town feeling)\n-I had good faculty and advisor for my masters (college of ed)\n-cost of living is fairly low, economy/property values are growing due to construction of NBAF\n-welcoming and friendly university community\n\nDislikes:\n-Hot (I'm from Michigan)\n-Living in the prairie (beautiful but again, I'm from the north, and this was more unsettling than I expected)\n-Secluded (long drive to other cities)\n-Kansas is very Christian and conservative (can be good depending on your preferences)\n\nThe marketing slogan for the state is \"Kansas - It's not that bad\". I thought this was hilarious when I saw it but after 2 years there I think it was totally accurate. I don't regret my time in Manhattan at all. It was not a bad place to live and go to school. But that's about all I can say for it. Kansas is empty, flat, and pretty boring. There isn't much to dislike but there isn't much to like either because at the end of the day there just isn't much. (To be fair, Manhattan is in the flint hills which is not flat and is the only really beautiful part of Kansas, so that is a positive)",

            "comment": "I have been here for 3 years and now starting my first year of vet school here.  I am from TX so have a little different perspective.  I have had a great time here and totally enjoy it.  Housing is easy to find and inexpensive, the campus atmosphere is really nice, the professors are very helpful and great to their grad students.  They will help them, stay late to work with them, etc.  I do feel the campus is family.  I found plenty to do and loved the town, lake, etc.  I didn't find the drive in to Kansas City for concerts or Chief's games bad at all.  (ok in TX we are user to long drives).  \n\nThe weather was nice to me.  I loved getting snow and having seasons.  The campus is conservative but not overwhelming.  I had lots of very liberal friends.  Masters is a little different than undergrad.  The teams work very well together.  If you can come visit.  In person tours are available now.  It is really a nice place to go to school.  There are lots of events on campus and in the town.  Even now it isn't totally dead!  I love how cheap it is to live here and don't miss being in a huge city like where I'm from.",

            "comment": "Amazing campus, fairly cheap when living off campus, very friendly people everywhere. I lived in Manhattan for 2 years and never had a problem with it. I think the only bad think would be winter time is kind of rough when walking to class. I could never get parking in the parking lots around campus so I just always used the parking garage and if you have a class all the way across campus, its a tough walk in the winter. Campus is BEAUTIFUL in the fall and spring though. Its pretty close to Kansas City, only about 2 hours, thats where I live now.\n\nI saw your comment about dating apps. Fort Riley is less than 30 minutes away and I know a lot of people who have used Tinder to find people. My sister met her boyfriend whos at Fort Riley on Tinder. Plus, theres always Aggieville, easy place to flirt it up",

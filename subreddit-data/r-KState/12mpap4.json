            "comment": "I depends a lot on which courses you pick. Classes like physics, calculus, and chemistry will take quite a few more study hours than the intro to public speaking class. The intro class for each engineering major makes a difference too, as some will involve labwork but others won't. It's good to mix difficult classes with lighter ones each semester to avoid burning out.\n\nIf you're good at managing your time, college offers a lot of flexibility with scheduling classes. I knew I'm not a morning person, so I managed to almost never have a class before 9am in my computer science undergrad. If you have a specific time of day you like to go to the gym, your favorite general time to block out for studying, and a good idea of when you get hungry, fill your classes out around those times.\n\nI also had a good time when I let my Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule be a lot different from Tuesday/Thursday. In at least two semesters, I packed classes in to MWF and left TR mostly open for either studying on busy weeks or free time on light weeks. You could do something similar while still blocking out a daily gym visit. Perhaps even a heavy TR with gym visits on MWF and the weekends.",

            "comment": "I think it depends on your field and the classes you\u2019re taking. I found that CompE offered very little flexibility because it often lined up that I had tests or projects every week. It was especially bad during my sophomore year. \n\nWhen I switched to CS I was still busy but had a lot more time. It\u2019s possible to make everything work but I think you have to be prepared to make sacrifices and work to keep a consistent schedule.",

You just need to set priorities\u2014school, food, chores, exercise, recreation, partying\u2026(whatever yours are) and be willing to chop off the bottom priorities if your out of time, that is, if you want good grades. I was a student athlete (practice and separate sessions in the weight room plus competition on Saturday). I got a BS ME, with a solid upper 3 GPA and managed to drink a lot of beer. \n\nBiggest lesson, do the homework as soon as it\u2019s assigned (like the free period after that class) and make use of the professors \u201coffice hours\u201d. I got my job, at one of the \u201cTop 10 places to work\u201d because, unknown to me, one of my professors knew and recommended me to the interviewer. It was my Machine Vibrations, prof\u2014I didn\u2019t like him but I guess it showed something by me going to him to ask questions. \n\nYou\u2019ll be fine.",

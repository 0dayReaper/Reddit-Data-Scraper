I used to think most people would typically graduate in 4 years, but it seems honestly that most are taking more than that. What are your perspectives what makes people take more than 4 years to graduate and how common is it for people to graduate in 4 years?",

It's possible but you have to retake minimal classes, and make sure you plan ahead for classes that are only available in spring/fall and be ready to take summer classes if something happens like failing or not getting into a class. \n\nWhen I first went to college I was told that it's common for degrees to take 5 years now. Probably stems from no overworking yourself, summer classes aren't required, likely you'll fail a few classes, etc. But it's absolutely possible to do it in four, even less if you try really hard.",

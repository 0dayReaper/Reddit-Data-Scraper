    "postText": "I'll be graduating this December and have gotten the email to apply for graduation and order the cap and gown. While looking over the various packages with my mother, she noticed the graduation sash as an additional item you can purchase. I didn't want to spend the extra $62 for something extra I'll only ever use once but she insisted that I get it. Should I buy it?\n\nAlso, aren't these stoles/sashes reserved for people with certain achievements and honors?",

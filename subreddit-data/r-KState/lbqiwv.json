    "postText": " Hey everyone my roommate and I will be losing our other roommate, and we need a female roommate replacement ASAP. It's a three bed, two bath halve of a duplex. Everyone here is pretty quiet and studious, and it's a really nice place. It's 325/month plus electric, water, heating, and wifi. No pets are allowed, and we are located on Bertrand Street near 6th.",

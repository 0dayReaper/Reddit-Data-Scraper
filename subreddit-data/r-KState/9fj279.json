    "postText": "My wife is a K-State graduate but we no longer live in Kansas, having relocated to Oregon. A few weeks ago I accidentally broke her favorite pint glass, which had the old Wildcat Willie logo on it (the one that looked like Tom, from Tom &amp; Jerry) and a banner that read \u201cWildcats Forever.\u201d\n\nSearching online, I\u2019ve been able to find glasses with Willie on them or glasses that have the banner, but nothing with both. With Varney\u2019s gone I tried the Rally House but came up short. Now I\u2019m unsure of where to go next. Any ideas?",

This doesn't say Wildcats forever but I think its the same design that your looking for.

I had one of those pint glasses as well. \n\nThey still offer the glasses with membership, not sure if the design is different. You could get in contact with them and I am sure they would be happy to help you out. \n\n[https://www.k-state.com/wildcatsforever/wildcatsforeverfaqs.php](https://www.k-state.com/wildcatsforever/wildcatsforeverfaqs.php)",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I'm Kevin and I'm looking for a male roommate(s) for next school year. I'm a senior in geology and geography and doing a certificate in GIS, so I prefer other upper classmen to room with, idc what major. I'm only going to be in classes in the fall, so it would have to be off campus but, I'm putting this out here now to have adequate time for responses. \nI work at a tutor for athletics, so I do have income and can help in certain classes. I'm in the marching band and cat band if that matters. \n\nCouple things: I do not have a car and so I have to be close to campus. I have a lot of stuff and I cannot move all of it to a tall floor because I have permanent kidney stones. I want a roommate that is going to be around and wants to hang out. I have had roommates that weren't around often and so I am tired of being by myself all the time. I also can't do more than $450 a month for rent and utilities.\nFeel free to open a convo with me here. I'd be down. I'm basically an open book.",

If you're unsure ask your adviser or your department's dean:\n\n*DON\u2019T decorate caps or gowns. This distracts from the program and may interfere with ceremonial photographs. University policy prohibits the decoration of commencement regalia (caps and gowns).  Graduation regalia is not ornamented.  Wearing of corsages, boutonnieres or any other ornamentation is not appropriate to academic protocol.* ",

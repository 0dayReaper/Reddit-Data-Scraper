Is there any major differences between Marlatt and Goodnow I should know about? I know Wefald is the best one but I\u2019m not sure I can afford that.",

I think both have had mini renovations, since then however. \n\nSo I would expect them to be similar still today. The truth is as long as it's good enough for you, it'll be more about keeping  a good relationship with your roommate (if possible) and meeting new people, that will matter most for an enjoyable living experience.",

Renovations in both put them pretty equal, but Goodnow is more recently renovated. Can't go wrong with either pick, but I definitely had a greater time at Goodnow.",

You will have the same college experience, one will be more expensive and renovated. Personally, I kind of wished I found a roommate and lived in an apartment on college heights or platt instead, as it can be less expensive, closer to engineering, and have a personal bathroom and kitchen. There\u2019s no rule that freshman have to live in the dorms, so keep your mind open.",

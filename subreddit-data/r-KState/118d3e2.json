    "postText": "Hi guys! I'm a senior at K-State with a minor in English Writing, and want to offer to edit people's papers for $5 a piece. *I will not write papers for you; I will only edit papers you have written yourself.* If you're in any classes that depend on good writing but don't have many people you want editing your paper, feel free to DM me and I can give you my contact info and past work if you want to verify it's worth it. It's $5 for the entire paper being edited for papers up to 6 pages long. If you have any questions feel free to comment or DM!",

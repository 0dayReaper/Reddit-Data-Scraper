At the time (nearly 20 years ago now) though, it was definitely the most run down building of all the dorms.  Honestly, that kinda says something about what you really want in a dorm...the building itself, especially as a college kid, can suck ass but if you've got good people to live with it, it'll be a wonderful experience.",

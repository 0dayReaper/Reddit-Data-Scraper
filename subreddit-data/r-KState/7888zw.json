    "postText": "Basically the title. I\u2019m looking at dorm rooms for next year and I want to know the pros and cons of staying in each dorm. I know Wefald is a lot newer and nicer, but it\u2019s also more expensive. I didn\u2019t get a chance to tour Marlatt, only Wefald. So does anybody have an honest opinion of these dorms? Is Wefald worth the extra money? I heard that the bathrooms in marlatt are gross, is this true? \n\nI would stay in a traditional double in Marlatt and a traditional private in Wefald. \n\nThanks! ",

Marlatt has a history and while it smells and stuff being close to other people has its benefits in creating an awesome community and freshman year experience for you. Though wefald is doing that. If you are looking into something other than marlatt and want to be in the kramer complex. i lived in Goodnow my freshman year and loved it, and it didnt smell and there is a suite option if you want to pay it.\n\nI highly recommend taking a tour of both if you visit campus and making your decision from there",

I was on the first floor for a year and then a 2 person suite in the basement for a semester. The suites are very nice and certainly  comfortable. You'd only be sharing a bathroom with 3 others (your roommate and the 2 in the adjoining room, or your other 3 roommates if you're in the 4 person suite). Like others have said, if you get the chance, go tour each one and get a feel for them. The desk staff can usually find someone to give you the tour. \n \nGranted, I started at KSU in 2003. A lot of the renovations  hadn't started yet and Wefald wasn't even built yet. ",

If something breaks, floods, gets puked on, etc. after hours or on the weekend, there are on call staff that can come deal with it enough to make it until Monday for the maintenance crew to look at.\n\nI usually wore flip flops at all times just to be on the safe side. Also, invest in a shower caddy, a little tote that you can put your soap, shampoo, etc in. Drill holes in the bottom so it drains.\n\nAsk away on your housing questions. I lived in the halls (Goodnow and Moore) all 5 years and was an Resident Assistant (RA) for 3 1/2 years, and a Community Assistant and Housing Ambassador for a semester (got on as an RA midyear). ",

You'll always have a handful of people that don't want to socialize. If you want to get involved, the biggest things you can do are hang out in the lobby, keep your room door open (don't forget to close it when you need to study), and go to the programs your building RA's put on. Many of them are social. You'll have to put in a bit more effort if you are in the first floor as there's only the main lobby of the building. ",

If you can deal with being close and personal with your roommate and friends then save some money! Wefald is absolutely beautiful, but if I had to do freshman year all over I'd probably still choose my old floor at Goodnow.",

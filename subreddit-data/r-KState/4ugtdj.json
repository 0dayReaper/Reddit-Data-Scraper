    "postText": "I posted many months ago about starting in improv group. Good news! I have a willing partner in Aggieville who will put up the space and time necessary to do an improv workshop and open mic night. The catch is I need at least 10 committed individuals before they will go forward with the plan.\n\nThe improv workshop will be $5 to participate, last 90 minutes, and is open to all skill levels, from first timers to seasoned pros. The improv will be followed by an open mic night. Please message me if you're interested or know anyone interested!",

    "postText": "Hello KState community. My name is Tyler King and I am posting about a writing/digital media opportunity with The Armchair All-Americans. We are currently in the process of adding at least 3 writers to our staff. \n\nWe are a sports journalism media outlet located all around the US. With our site getting thousands of views per week, we are starting to pick up some steam and need to expand our Kansas State department. We have worked with major athletes, coaches, and media personalities across the country. We have the ability to set you up with contacts, interviews, writing and media opportunities on campus to improve your personal writing/media portfolio as well as the ability to offer internship credit if you are in school. \n\nThis position can be done from any location but preferably on campus and only requires about 5-10 hours of work per week. We generally ask for writers to cover beat reporting for their school. We may also need your assistance in feature/long form writing, statistics compilation, and work in audio/video composition. \n\nIf this position interests you, or you would like some more information about ACAA, feel free to shoot me a message or contact me at: armchairbig12@gmail.com. \n\nThanks,\n\nTyler",

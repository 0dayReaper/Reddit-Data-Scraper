    "postText": " **ACT NOW your December payment have already been made**. There are 6 months left on my lease at the Gramercy Apartments located at 2215 College Ave. Manhattan, Kansas 66502. It\u2019s located walking distance away from the football stadium. My current rent rate is **$519.00 per bedroom for a 2-bedroom floor plan** with the lease ending **July 31, 2021.** You will be responsible for electricity and water (IF OVER THE $30.00 ALOTTED AMOUNT). The average for electricity is about **($80)** per month. The rent rate does include trash, pest control, snow removal, lawn care, cable, and internet. Another great thing about re-letting is that you DO NOT have to live in the same apartment I lived in, all you must do is agree to be my re-let and you can move into any apartment within the complex.\n\n**If you are interested, please contact Thomas Grayson at 918-695-6495.** If you would like to set up a tour or have any additional questions mention my name and please contact Sylvia at 785-539-0500 a Leasing Professional at 785-539-0500.",

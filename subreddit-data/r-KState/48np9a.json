So I'm wondering if anyone knows of or is involved in any groups around here? \nThe version doesn't really matter to me, but homebrew is preferred (but not necessary). \nThanks any help!",

I know they play MTG and Warhammer in the backroom, so I wouldn't surprised if they have some D&amp;D groups or know how to get ahold of some.  Unfortunately, I think all the other gaming shops around town have closed down at this point.",

Just ask an employee, or bring your own group and play! They have manuals for sale too usually (is that a D&amp;D thing? I heard someone mention it).",

I have participated in volunteer work throughout high school as well as having done a bit of partying. Are frats even a legitimate option for me?\n\nIf so, what's the general view toward them, will I be an outcast from the people in dorms?\n\nWhat are the best fraternities with housing?",

            "comment": "Being in a fraternity at Kstate myself, my best advice is that living in a fraternity can be as good and as bad as you make it. People in the dorms are just as regular as you are and as long as you be yourself and don't give into the stupid TFM superiority bullshit nobody will have a problem with you. You will inevitably be living with a few or more guys you aren't a fan of but you'll also make a bunch of great friends from all over. \n\nMy only advice would just be attend rush events at different fraternities and you might find one you like. If you don't then you'll still have a good time in the dorms. ",

I went into a fraternity and couldn't be happier with my choice. Look at the fraternities on k-state's website and that will tell you which ones have housing. I would encourage you to rush every house that piques your interest and ask anyone you might know at k-state what they think. Fraternities are an awesome option and it's definitely still possible to be friends with people in dorms.",

What I can say from an office stand point is that majority of the Fraternities (and all of the Sororities) have chapter wide GPAs above the all campus average, a trend that has been consistent for over a decade now. \n\nMy suggestion would be to check out Greek Experience - a day long seminar for graduating high school seniors to check out their options in Greek Life here. \n\nhttp://www.k-state.edu/fsl/greek_experience/\n\nThere are a number of excellent options in housing, both wet and dry. I do know of a few organizations that have events with other Residence halls so that you may feel connected to those students as well.\n\nFeel free to pm me if you have any other questions, or would like to schedule a visit at Greek Experience or a 1 on 1 visit with one of the undergraduate students.\n\n-Kyle",

            "comment": "Yes fraternities are definitely an option.\n\nI have lived in essentially all housing options K-State offers (okay I didn't live in sorority) so I can compare different options pretty well. I also looked at several houses before picking the one I did and I am glad I didn't rush (get the pun) right into it.\n\nMost of the fraternities have houses. Some are wet and some are dry, but the enforcement of those rules and atmosphere is different at each one.\n\nYou will not be an outcast from the dorm people. The people here are nice and won't be a problem, and if you catch flak for being in a frat then they probably wouldn't be good to hang around anyways. If anything you'll be more popular with the dorm people as they look for a place to go party.\n\nI would recommend getting in contact with the recruitment chairs of different fraternities and checking them out. Rush for fraternities is Informal as opposed to the sororities so you can get a feel for the guys in the house. Remember, join the house for the guys in it, not the letter on the front of it. What you hear at one college is vastly different rom the reality at another I have found. \n\nIt sounds like you won't have much time to feel out a fraternity if you don't come up a bit early (which I recommend, I don't think you would regret taking a the trip). There is some time at the beginning before pledge cards are due but don't rush into a house just to do it. Some offer spring rush, and there is always next year. If you know it's right than definitely do it but I've seen guys end up in just about every house that didn't fit right and didn't like the experience.\n\nAs for the priority on schoolwork, every house will be different to an extent but it will really boil down to *you*. I've seen kids party too hard in the dorms and drop out, and 4.0s in hard majors in fraternities.\n\nThere are a lot of good fraternities at K-State, I am sure you will do just fine. Let me know if you have any questions.",

            "comment": "I did the fraternity life at KSU, and you can pad the ol' resume with your \"activities\" (for about a year after you graduate) but if you aren't graduating in business or marketing, you can forget networking.  I did Americorps and the Peace Corps and got a real job from there.  My \"duties\" in the house did make it look like I was a functional member of society. but I haven't put any of that on my resume since a year after I graduated.  Don't sweat making friends and meeting girls, you don't need to align yourself with a bunch of guys you don't like to do that.\n",

    "postText": "He's in a pretty suckish situation at the moment. His job went kaput when covid hit, then he got a new job at a call center. This call center pays him 10/hr, and it is probably one of the worst jobs you could get. They keep holding raises over their heads, and the customers are absolutely terrible to him. \n\nDoes anybody know of anybody who would be willing to hire him? He is 28, in the National Guard, high school diploma, and is certified in welding and small arms maintenance. He is willing to take anything other than his current job at the moment, and any suggestions or advice would be appreciated.",

They manufacture glass in a building nearby Walmart, but I'm pretty sure they also offer jobs as trucks mechanics and general repair as well. I think the pay is about what you're looking for, but online reviews from workers show it may not have the best management.",

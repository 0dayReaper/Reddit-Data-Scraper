    "postText": "Crossposted with r/littleapple to hopefully save more unsuspecting students. \n\nThis is a review of the Gramercy apartments at MHK.  You might be tempted, as I was by the insanely low rent at MHK, with roommate matching service and seemingly nice amenities. Don't fall for it. I have been living independently for 5 years, and it was very clear that the staff assumed I was just another college-girl they could screw over who didn't have a clue how to fight for my tenant rights. Well, they may have come out with more money than they deserve, or are even OWED from me, but I'll be damned if I don't post the most brutally honest reviews about them everywhere. I don't even review places/things, but it is TIME, my friends. \n1. Assigned to 4 bedroom unit, 3 of four bedrooms are filled- then 1 roommate is required to leave due to safety issues, issues the Gramercy didn't help with, but crisis workers and support systems. \n2. Dirty diapers, constant trash, smoking, and loud neighbors along the hall/walkways. Walkways littered with dog waste, again dirty diapers, and constantly bags of trash. Never cleaned shared, community spaces. \n3. Amenities were often broken or unusable (coffee bar, water fountains, etc.)\n4. My car was hit TWICE in the parking lot, both times causing extensive damage, both times with cops called, but due to lack of security and surveillance, was labelled as hit and runs, and repairs coming from my pocket. \n5. Bug infestations, mostly spiders and ants, where maintenance was called several times, and the issue continued. We were told that it was due to food in the kitchen (where else do you store dry goods?) But when we showed them the hole in the wall below the sink where the ants were clearly coming in, they magically were able to fix it. \n6. After leaving for winter break, I was sure to lock my room and turn off/unplug all appliances. I KNOW I did this because I have compulsive issues and literally checked 5 times before I could leave the apartment. When I returned my room was UNLOCKED and the fan was on. A new roommate moved in while I was on break, someone I had never met, and she had full access to my private room that entire time. \n7. For the past 6 months my and my roommates utility bills have been EXORBITANT. I'm talking for 2 girls in a 4 bedroom apartment where 2 rooms are empty, and neither of us home- we are paying nearly 350 in combined utilities. Whereas an apartment down the hall, with all 4 bedrooms filled, has never paid more than $150 TOGETHER for utilties. Thats $35 a person. We have requested energy tests, and everytime they -check- are told nothing is wrong. For the past 3 months there has been ONE person in the apt. Only using water for showers/dishes and electricity for her room. Our combined bill this payment period? $400. For one person. It is impossible for us to have that much energy usage with ONE PERSON in the apartment, when a four bedroom, filled apartment, pays 150. \n\nLastly, the communication has been sorely lacking between the office and us. We have had to call multiple times to request the same fixes for the same issues we have had for months. We are often met with attitudes and sharp replies. Theres so much more I could say but I'm tired. \n\nI know I sound like a Karen, or a whiny bitch, but honestly, I'm just a grad student who has worked hard to be able to be where I am, and I am pissed that I got fucked over again and again by this company/conplex and I honestly don't want anyone else to deal with this. So don't do Gramercy. Just don't.",

We also had roaches this year and all they did to fix it was put down sticky pads. The only time they'd ever fix anything was when I threatened to stop paying rent.\n\nAlso, my utilities bills were also only around $35 each month so you were definitely getting screwed.",

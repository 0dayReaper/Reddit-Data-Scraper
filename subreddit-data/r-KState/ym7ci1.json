Also, any cool spots on campus you recommend seeing? I enjoy strolling through different campuses and was wondering what you guys count as highlights.",

You\u2019ve got a great memorial to troops next to (south of) Anderson Hall that\u2019s pretty neat to check out. The engineering building is a cool building to view and right across the street (south) is the old gym and stadium next to the Student Union.",

            "comment": "First off, Go Cats!\n\nWe\u2019ve got two entertainment districts, downtown and Aggieville. Both have something for all ages, particularly during the daytime hours, but after dark, Aggieville tends to skew younger as it\u2019s our real bar district. Downtown would skew a bit older and things close down earlier. There is awesome food and drink in both areas, some things that come to mind: Taco Lucha &amp; So Long Saloon in the ville, Tallgrass Taphouse and Bourbon and Baker downtown.\n\nTailgating at Kstate is the pregame thing. I think the players walk up through the west stadium lot before hand but I\u2019m not sure when or if that happens every game. Lots open five hours prior to kick. \n\nI\u2019m a townie so I can\u2019t help much on great spots on campus.",

            "comment": "Aggieville is the main bar district right next to campus, it\u2019ll be packed after the game so could be tough to find a sit down type restaurant if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, otherwise that\u2019ll be the place to be for post-game drinks. I recommend Auntie Maes as a pretty chill bar, rockabelly deli is also solid. Campus is very walkable, it\u2019s tightly packed and doesn\u2019t require students hopping on a shuttle/bus to get to another class on time. You can easily get from one end to the other walking in 15-20 minutes so I\u2019d just mosey around a bit before the game maybe. Anderson Lawn is probably the most recognizable area on campus, our library is pretty cool and has an old study area that\u2019s been kept to look like it\u2019s original early 20th century design that students call the \u201cHarry Potter Room\u201d.\n\nPregame our tailgate scene is a massive parking lot surrounding the stadium that\u2019s maybe a 3/4 of a mile off campus, people are pretty friendly if you want to wander around tailgates. It\u2019ll also be Harley Day which is an annual tradition where probably 50ish fans donate money to ride motorcycles around the field 10-15 minutes before kickoff",

I want asked one of the workers there why the ice cream was so good, and she said because it\u2019s like 95% butterfat lol.\n\nAnderson Hall/Hale Library/Nichols Hall for limestone architecture. \n\nNichols hall for history: it burned down in the 60s. As the story goes,the band director managed to save one piece of sheet music from the fire\u2014 the Wabash Cannonball (which you\u2019ll hear plenty during the game:) ).",

I\u2019m not sure what your schedule looks like but the campus gardens are nice to walk through. Almost all of main campus is worth at least a brief walkthrough. My personal highlights are Hale library, Seaton/Regnier design building, and the mid campus drive hill. Have a great time at the Bill!",

So, if a few start saying they won't open this fall for student's safety the others will most likely follow.  I find it scary that the consensus seems to be that they won't be able to make their full semester.  I don't like the idea of students signing year leases in Manhattan when it may become unnecessary to be there at all.",

Again, I think it\u2019s possible for them to change it mid-semester but I would say it\u2019s safe to assume the current plan will be accurate right now. And I know with the lease, I have an apartment in MHK and I\u2019m barely ever there nowadays. I\u2019ll probably be there while we have online classes again though, with work. I can imagine that will be a similar situation with other people too.",

They\u2019re huge for funding and having even the chance for in-person classes will bring a lot of students back. It\u2019s fucked but schools all over are hurting for money and some may very well close. People all over the country, hell, people I know personally, have said that they aren\u2019t going to pay big money to take online classes so it\u2019s not like schools like K-State can really afford to not hold in-person classes. Again, I want to reiterate, I don\u2019t think that justifies this. I am very much so not comfortable with in-person classes, as much as I hate online ones. I think it\u2019s gonna end up getting people sick but this is a decision that K-State very likely will not back out of until at least the school year has started. \n\nThis is true. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s justified, it does suck. Honestly though, if you\u2019re paying for an apartment, it\u2019s actually cheaper to not live there as long as you\u2019re not paying for a second one. That said, it really does blow to have an apartment I barely ever live in, even if it\u2019s just for the summer.",

    "postText": "So, I\u2019ve officially committed to Kansas State for my PhD starting in Fall 2019! Yay! \n\nI\u2019m wondering if you guys could point me in the direction of some decent apartment complexes that are within walking distance to campus that allow cats. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have a car my first year, and I\u2019ll probably walk every day to campus so I was hoping to find something within a 15-20 minute walk that is also cat friendly. I\u2019m unsure on how much I want to pay for rent right now, but ideally I wouldn\u2019t mind having two bedrooms if that was possible. I\u2019d like to have a washer and dryer in unit but I\u2019m not picky. \n\nI know I\u2019m starting the search early but I wanna see what\u2019s out there. I really appreciate any help you can throw my way. Sorry about all the requirements, I\u2019ve never been to Kansas before at all-so this is all totally new to me. ",

Westchester is probably out of walking distance and Georgetown is probably close to the limit. I will say we do have bus service though! Or a bicycle can be nice. A 2 bedroom will probably run you a little under $1k/month in the two complexes mentioned above.",

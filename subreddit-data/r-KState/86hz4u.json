Coach will always have a special place in the hearts of Illini fans and I know the Illini will always have a place in his heart (he did buy Jarling's Custard Cup).  I so excited for Coach Weber.  He is an amazing coach and maybe an even more amazing person.  \n\nNow, can all you K-State fans stop picking on him?  You are most likely going to the Final Four!!",

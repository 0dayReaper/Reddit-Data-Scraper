Wondering where in the wing this falls \\- \"front\" of wing, mid\\-way, end by study room \\(I think study rooms are at end?\\)?  Also, does anyone know what direction our window will face \\- what the view is of?  Also wondering if I should bring an Ethernet cord with me, if they have Ethernet connections or if it is all wifi.  TIA for the input!",

    "postText": "Hi I\u2019m a junior who transferred to KState in the fall of 2020. I love the whole college life and being independent qualities KState brings me but Manhattan doesn\u2019t feel like home to me. Before I moved down to start school I had visited the campus once before and even then the town and feel was off. I really want to stay in state to save money but my dream school is University of Iowa.. I just don\u2019t know if the town isn\u2019t right for me or if I haven\u2019t been able to experience it due to covid. For the spring semester I moved back home to do online as I was living in the dorms. I want to try and move back to Manhattan in the fall just so I can be on my own again in an apartment. So do I transfer or try to stick it out till I have a degree in my hands?",

Does it matter where the degree is from?\n\nHow much does the degree from KSU vs Iowa cost? Are you taking on loans?",

But that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be able to have fun in Manhattan. It\u2019s a close knit community so it\u2019s important to have a good consistent group of friends. You should come back to Manhattan and give it another try, it\u2019s very easy to make connections here, definitely a lot easier than U of I. You should also stick around and see how the town changes after the city finishes the major construction projects this year.",

There use to be a game store downtown by the mall and AJs if you're into Magic or other gsmes.  Hopefully when you get on campus intermurals will be back, maybe something there.  Might be able to spark up a convo at Mae's over a game of pool upstairs.  Check out clubs too.  \n\n\nTheres are all things I wish I knew when I first got on campus.  Good luck to you.  You have your interests and just find those around town and you'll find more like minded people.",

            "comment": "Hey man, first I just want to say I feel for all of you students having to deal with Covid and being at school. I know that would have been really hard for me.\n\nOnly you can make the final decision. First look into if a transfer is even feasible: Look into the financials, look into the application deadlines, all of that fun admin stuff. Depending on the outcome, you may not even really have a decision to make.\n\nNext, think about why you're drawn to Iowa so much. Remember, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. What makes you think that you'll not have the same issues when you get to Iowa City? You mentioned you came in 'cold' as a transfer with no friends. This is likely why you aren't 'feeling' the town. This feeling may persist with you during the transfer. I would try and put myself out there: join clubs, sports, live with roommates, etc (something I wish I did more in uni). Also, trust me, this only gets more difficult when you graduate and move cities for your job. Making friends is a skill: it takes effort and practice, it can be awkward, but it's very worth it.\n\nI never 'loved' Manhattan: I grew up in Kansas and I wanted to leave as soon as I could, and I really like big cities. My dream school was UT Austin, but it just wasn't realistic. Hell if I would have transferred there I would have partied my face off and probably gotten kicked out. I have no regrets, I loved my time at KState, and Manhattan is a 'cool' college town - there is certainly fun to be had. You can always have your dream school in your pocket as that second school you root for. Or, you can even do some post grad study there. \n\nHope that helps in some way! Best of luck.",

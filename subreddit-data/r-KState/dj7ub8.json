I'll be happy to bring \"supplies.\" \n\nAlso, I have never attended a game and was wondering what the best way to get tickets would be? Online? at the ticket office game day? Get them from somone in the parking lot? Other?\n\nAlso, any advice on parking would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

I can scalp tickets for about 20 bucks at most games. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not tailgaiting this weekend or you could join.  You can pretty well guarantee free food and drink walking around the grass lot east of the stadium.  That's where the students and younger alumni tend to tailgate, it's going to be more of a party tailgate area.  If you're looking for slightly more refined tailgaters, you can check the paved lots east and west of the stadium.",

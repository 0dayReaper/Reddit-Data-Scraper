            "comment": "So, I'm literally living here right now. For the next two weeks, anyways. I can tell you that all the B-wing rooms were renovated back in 2017-2018, and the rest of the building was renovated in the 2018-2019 school year. Some rooms have a grey plastic floor with a simulated wood grain texture, while others have a brown plastic wood floor. All rooms have digital thermostats, dry hydrogen peroxide machines, ethernet, and they renovated the ceiling to now have ceiling tiles and the lights are no longer in a box, but now in a... half tube of sorts? Kinda hard to explain. The only place they didn't get a lot of loving was the restrooms, and that's just because they didn't have the resources to completely tear them down. What they did do was they made all the showers have a divider, and have the shower head on that divider. They also sealed up the bathtub, which was used to clean off people's feet after playing in the volleyball pit. Couldn't explain to you why.",

                    "comment": "&gt; The white nationalist movement, tarnished [in the aftermath of Charlottesville](https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article166895372.html), is repackaging its bigotry through a new mainstreaming strategy that focuses on college campuses and Trump supporters, according to a report released Tuesday by a national watchdog organization.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Its first test case: a new group at Kansas State University launched by a student whose former organization was the subject of protests on campus.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Known as \u201cGroyper,\u201d the new marketing effort is an attempt by white nationalists to rebrand under a banner that will unite what it describes as \u201cAmerica First conservatives, Christians, anti-globalists and nationalists,\u201d says the report, [published by the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights](https://www.irehr.org/reports/alt-right-to-groyper/).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Leading the effort, the report says, are two activists who promoted and participated in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. The gathering ended with a white nationalist plowing his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing one.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThis is an attempt to replace the old label of alt-right, which got pretty toxic after Charlottesville, and try to create new coalitions on university campuses and in and around the Trump orbit,\u201d said Devin Burghart, executive director of the institute and co-author of the 64-page report, From Alt-Right to Groyper: White Nationalists Rebrand for 2020 and Beyond.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThose are the two main targets of recruitment for them right now.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The strategy will have its trial run, Burghart said, at K-State, where the [formation of a new organization, America First Students](https://twitter.com/McNeilJaden/status/1219668596143677445/photo/1), was announced last month. The first meeting was Jan. 28, according to its Twitter account.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;America First Students is led by Jaden McNeil, a current student and former president of the K-State chapter of Turning Point USA, a conservative youth activist network. That organization was [the subject of protests on campus last year](https://themercury.com/news/education/protesters-conservative-speakers-clash-at-k-state/article_a58a4e0c-d0e7-558f-89c2-26d2e062a78f.html) by the KSU Young Democrats, which said Turning Point USA was associated with hateful rhetoric and called for the group to be removed from campus.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;K-State spokeswoman Michelle Geering said in an email that America First Students \u201cis an independent student organization registered with K-State\u2019s Center for Student Involvement.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cIndependent student organizations are not operated or controlled by the university,\u201d she said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;McNeil did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. At the time of last year\u2019s protest, he said he wished the two sides could come to an understanding.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cInstead of having a protest I wish they could come and discuss our differences because we have a lot more in common then they believe,\u201d he said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;McNeil and other TPUSA officers resigned from the K-State chapter in October. McNeil said in an Oct. 31 tweet that he was parting ways with the organization because \u201cTPUSA constantly cedes cultural ground to the Left.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now, the report says, McNeil has joined forces with Nick Fuentes and Pat Casey, whom the institute describes as white nationalists. Fuentes is a far-right YouTuber and podcaster, and Casey is head of the American Identity Movement, formerly known as [Identity Evropa, a white nationalist organization](https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article105980767.html) known for distributing racist propaganda on college campuses in the past few years. Both Fuentes and Casey attended the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fuentes and Casey announced the formation of America First Students at a [\u201cGroyper Leadership Summit\u201d](https://twitter.com/nickjfuentes/status/1201564312290123776?lang=en) in Florida in December, praising McNeil\u2019s efforts.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cGroyper\u201d is the name of a far-right meme based on a cartoon toad \u2014 the latest mutation of the Pepe the Frog meme, a symbol used by Trump supporters and co-opted by white nationalists.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cFrom day one, the \u2018Groypers\u2019 have been as slippery as the toad for which they are named \u2014 an ever-changing effort to obfuscate their ideology and keep white nationalism germane inside MAGA world and the GOP,\u201d said IREHR research director, Charles Tanner.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As part of their strategy to become more mainstream, the report says, the \u201cGroypers\u201d are holding an \u201cAmerica First Political Action Conference\u201d in Washington, D.C., at the end of the month to coincide with the Conservative Political Action Conference.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Last month, Fuentes congratulated McNeil on the launch of America First Students at Kansas State.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThis project has amazing potential to rally American Nationalists and real conservatives on campus\u2026 ,\u201d Fuentes said in a tweet. \u201cI am very excited to see what comes next for AFS this year!\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fuentes and Casey could not be reached for comment Tuesday but have denied being white nationalists. The IREHR says evidence shows otherwise.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThey\u2019ll say this is just liberals trying to taint them, that they\u2019re just traditionalist conservatives who support Christian values,\u201d Burghart said. \u201cBut all of the key leadership, the influencers, hold ideals that any rational person would categorize as white nationalist.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cFuentes and Casey both represent this new generation of white nationalists. It\u2019s a whole new ballgame. These aren\u2019t millennials. This is white nationalism for the Zoomer generation.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;McNeil has described America First Students as \u201ca campus conservative organization defined by our support for closed borders, traditional families, the American worker, and Christian values.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He added that \u201cConservatism Inc. has brainwashed many students into believing that globalist policies \u2014 particularly free trade and mass immigration \u2014 constitute conservatism, when clearly they do not.\u201d He said America First Students would advocate for \u201cthe broader goal of defending America against globalism, affirming the vision laid out by President Trump in his inaugural address.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The organization plans to start chapters at other universities as well, according to its Twitter account.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cWe\u2019re going to focus on the Kansas State AFS chapter before branching out to other campuses,\u201d it says.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And on Feb. 5 Fuentes tweeted: \u201cI am exploring the possibility of an America First college tour this Spring. There are several events in the works already\u2026\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Burghart said while it\u2019s too soon to tell whether America First Students is a white nationalist organization, \u201cthey\u2019re promoting an agenda aligned with white nationalism.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cBut given that they\u2019re participating in the larger Groyper activity, it\u2019s definitely a sign of concern.\u201d",

It is the basic code of ethics that journalists are expected to follow.\n\nThat being said, it still doesn't change the fact that bias doesn't make a statement untrue. General leanings of an organization doesn't make this report untrue or inaccurate. A writer's personal positions on issues doesn't mean they can't objectively report on an issue.",

While I'm not affiliated with the group, I know the founder personally, and he's not anti LGBT or an anti-semite.  I think if anyone is being hateful it's you for jumping to these conclusions.  Many publishers will push these relationships to create these \"dogwhistles\" just to take down any group they disagree with.  Unless you know them personally I really don't think it's your place to accuse people of terrible things like this.",

            "comment": "If there are formulas, it will be on more complex stuff like infinite series, trig identities, or special integrals/derivatives. \n\nYou should, however, memorize certain trig values like knowing sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, and cot of all the values on the unit circle. \n\nSomeone else mentioned asking your professor, which is a great idea, but you can also look up \"K-State math exam archives\" on google and it should take you to a page with old math tests from the basic math classes at K-State so you can see what is typically provided on previous exams.",

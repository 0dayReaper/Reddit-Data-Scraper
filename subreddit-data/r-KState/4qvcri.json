            "comment": "I want to expand on what the other two posters have mentioned about studying.  I know for a fact there are some people reading this that think they can get by the way they did in high school.  And some of you might...for a few semesters.  If you're taking your gen eds first, there's a good chance a lot of you will do well without a whole lot of effort. MAKE THAT EFFORT ANYWAYS.  \n\nTake this from someone who was exactly like you and dropped out after three semesters.  When you are studying for some general basic writing class or macro econ 1, you're not studying to learn the material of that class.  You're studying to learn how to study, to learn what type of studying works best for you.  Can you effectively study in your dorm room or your bedroom at home?  Great.  What about at Hale?  Alone or in a group?  Maybe at Radina's or Bluestem Bistro.  Try them all out a few times, figure out where you can maintain your concentration best and get the most out of the time you put into the studying.\n\nI came to K-State in the fall of 2004 having had to do very little work to maintain As through most of my schooling.  I'd dropped into the B range in a few classes senior year but, for the most part, I'd skated my way through school.  I didn't know how to study.  I didn't know how to self motivate.  I didn't know how to remove distractions.  And I lasted all of a year and a half on gen eds and a few Mechanical Engineering intro classes.  It then took me 5 years working a variety of jobs to actually learn how to work, what strategies work best for me.  When I came back in 2011, I was significantly better prepared.  I now knew how to get the most out of my study time.\n\nIf you guys learn from the mistakes of people like me and put in the effort to learn how to work while you're taking your easy classes in the first year or two of college, you'll save yourself a lot of time, a lot of hassle, and a **LOT** of money.  So don't study for the sake of your early classes, study so you know how to by the time you hit the hard ones.",

For some people, they can cruise right by, but in most cases now you'll have to really study to get a good grade in whatever subject is giving you troubles. \n\nGo to class, it's okay to skip once or twice but if you know you'll get in the habit of doing it, don't. \n\nEveryone will also be new and getting used to campus, so take it as a opportunity to make friends. If you're doing dorm living, hang out with your floor. Go see free or cheap events on campus, it's another opportunity to have fun and meet new people. My personal favorites are the UPC films on the weekends and the improv shows. Being apart of something is great too and looks good on resumes, so check out extracurriculars!\n\nGo to games if you can; not just football, but volleyball, baseball, basketball, etc are all really fun and really get you hyped. \n\nThat's all I can think of for now. Have a great first year and welcome to the family!",

Or sports in general.  Cheering at The Bill doesn't require you to know what a nickel package is or who the starting receivers are but being there, cheering with and for your fellow students, will make this place feel much more like home.  It builds a connection with the people around you that is bigger than whatever sport is being played on the field or court.",

            "comment": "This may be a bit of a rehash but here's what I have as a rising senior. Sorry for the long post! Kind of got carried away.\n\nLeave your door open.\n\nSTUDY. Doesn't matter how well you did in high school - I can guarantee you're going to have to put in more time than you have before. Hale is awesome. The Great Room is my favorite.\n\nGet involved.  It's important to get out and join clubs and such. College is as much about forging connections and socializing as it is academics.\n\nAlso if you're going into the sciences, RESEARCH. Too many people don't know how great kstate is for undergrad research. If you're going into the natural sciences I can tell you more about this.\n\nKind of ties in with the above, but it ultimately comes down to \"seek and ye shall find.\" Kstate is huge, and that means there are a ridiculous number of opportunities out there for you to get involved and better yourself. But YOU must pursue them. \n\nThe double edged sword to being large is that ultimately kstate doesn't really care what you do, even if that means failing out. There is less of a support net than say a small school where all the faculty know your name. A little scary but also motivating. It's all up to you to succeed.\n\nLive. Your time at kstate could very well be some of the best years of your life. Find your balance between work and play that allows you to have fun while you're here. \n\nI hope all goes well! I absolutely love kstate and hope you will too. Welcome to the family.",

Go and talk to your adviser often.  They know the ins and out of this school better than anyone.  If you feel like your adviser isn't helpful or if you're not clicking, request a new adviser.  It happens all the time, nobody is going to get hurt if you switch.\n\nGo see your professors during office hours, even if you have to make up a question.  Professors will advocate for you and will support you when things get tough but only if they know you.\n\nThe University is a big, unfeeling, uncaring beast...but it is made up of thousands of people who honestly do want you to succeed.  You just have to make a bit of an effort to show them you want to succeed as well.",

My roommate never built a support network and a semester later got his letter telling him he's on academic probation.. And the next semester, ejection. I've seen how easy it is for someone to just fall through the cracks and just wanted to give a bit of a word of caution.\n\nAlso, OP, tutoring is available at Leasure Hall for basically any class and was a fantastic resource for me getting through gen-eds.

I just wanted to make sure that it was mentioned that there are people all over the university who do care, it's just up to the student to make sure they build that support network.",

Go in to their office hours with in the first two weeks and if nothing else introduce yourself. \n\nAfter that go to class.  I'd say everything weeks go in and visit with them ask a question or get clarification on something. \n\nDo this for every class.  This will do two things for you. First is it will help with your understanding of course work. Second is it will help your professor know you and at the end of the semester them knowing you and knowing you made an effort in their class will help you get those borderline grades bumped ",

You will have to work.  You will have to study.  You won't get by just by \"showing up\".\n\nHaving said that, don't forget to have fun.  I agree with everyone else who said to get involved in campus activities, attend sporting events, meet new people, but don't get black-out drunk every weekend.\n\nAlso, try not to chant \"fuck ku\" on national TV.

If the two participants in the photo were intentionally shaping the ponchos (which is not stated, nor on first reading of the article did it occur to me) then we have a situation that is more scandalous.\n\nHowever, to call either instance \u2018racist\u2019 is an abuse of the term.  Blackface is racist.  Slurs are racist.  This situation is not.  Humor is how people handle heavier issues.  This could even be a joke about the strange looking dressing habits of the organization, and then you have the *reverse* situation in which Klan members complain.  (Unlikely, but you get my drift.)  You don\u2019t know.  It\u2019s highly likely that these girls were not thinking of a cross burning on a lawn in the middle of the night or many other practices that the Klan has come to be identified with. \n\nBlindly calling this racism is manufactured outrage, and that is why I asked.",

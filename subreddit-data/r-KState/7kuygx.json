If I do need these books, would anyone be willing to sell their books? It\u2019s way too expensive at the bookstore and Amazon/Chegg don\u2019t sell them.",

You can get most books in under a week nowadays and if necessary you can always borrow someone\u2019s, work with someone who has one, or ask someone to send you pictures of the book if you need to use it right away.",

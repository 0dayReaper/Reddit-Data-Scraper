            "comment": "Hi! K-State Computer Science teacher (and current/former K-State Computer Science student) here. I'm obviously biased toward K-State, but I think K-State has a great computer science program. We are [ABET accredited](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/academics/undergraduate/accreditation/) and offer several options to choose from, but we aren't so big that it's hard to stand out and get involved. Many of the professors I work with now were my teachers when I was an undergraduate, and they are a major reason that I chose to become an educator myself (I think they are great!). Being located in the Midwest US, we have affordable tuition and cost of living compared to many other schools, but still have graduates working at major companies such as Garmin, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Cerner, and more. I encourage you to check out [our undergraduate programs](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/academics/undergraduate/) and [the integrated computer science program](https://www.k-state.edu/ics/) (full disclosure - I work directly with that program) or contact the CS department for more information. You can tell them my username and they'll know who I am. \n\nChoosing a school is tough - hopefully you can find a good fit for you!",

I can't speak for the whole program since I have only taken the minor courses, though. \n\nI'm now pretty comfortable writing programs in Java, Python, C#, and a little bit of C. \n\nThere a certain professors who are not great (but that's true anywhere). I'd say 80% that I had were great to be a student with and the other 20% were doable, but not perfect.",

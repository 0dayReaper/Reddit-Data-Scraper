    "postText": "So I've got this roommate who has parties every weekend at our house. They last from around 2am to almost daylight. I've talked to her, and told her that she needs to stop because I have work in the mornings on weekends, and I can't sleep with the loud music playing, and everybody screaming and laughing. She would say she would stop, only to be even louder during these parties. We are not in good terms with each other, due to her having gotten us in trouble before with other things like rent, utilities, harboring squatters, smoking in the house, starting trouble, etc. She had gotten a noise complaint from our neighbors. She was supposed to show up to court for it, but she never did, and now she has an active warrant. \n\nI know that calling for a noise complaint is petty and won't fix anything between us, but this has gone on long enough. Ive given her warnings, I've asked nicely, then sternly, then angrily. Five more months until this lease is done, and I'm just done. She has a warrant, and if she serves time, I woudn't be upset about it at all. I checked, and another noise complaint wouldn't affect me, other than her getting evicted (if the landlord finds out) and having to pay her part of the rent for the rest of the lease. I call it the \"no bad roommate subscription.\" \n\nFinally, my question is this: How loud does a party need to be to call in a noise complaint? I live in a duplex and so far the only ones it bothers are the tenants next door, and myself. The worst they have done lately, and last week, is talk and scream and yell until early the next day. I'm afraid that I'll call, and they'll say that this is something that only I can deal with one-on-one with my roommate. Another note is the landlord. The landlord wont let me sublet, wants me to get rid of this roommate myself, and is willing to evict her for a legit reason, as he has told me before.",

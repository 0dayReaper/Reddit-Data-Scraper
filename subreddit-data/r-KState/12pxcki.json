Almost all the rooms are basically the same, except for a few that I think have 4 people with a shared bathroom (instead of 1 big bathroom for a whole hallway).\n\nDon't worry too much about \"optimizing\" your placement in the dorms, unless you have some sort of mobility issue, in which case the lower floors would be best. Your experience will depend mostly on how outgoing you choose to be :)",

Of course, being across from the bathroom also provides other challenges. It also provided some unique social interactions while people waited for other people to exit the bathroom.\n\nSauce: My former Goodnow roommate measured every room on the wing. Lived in 619 for a year.",

Do not mess with water.  Just because it is not raining hard in Manhattan doesnt mean it isnt pouring someplace upstream.  The most recent damaging flooding of Wildcat Creek was mostly caused by heavy rains outside of Manhattan.  \n\nStop by Pathfinder:\n\nhttp://www.thepathfinder.net/bicycling/bike-repair\n\n\nThey have some great folks and can probably connect you with others.\n\nAlso, Brew Bros Hops &amp; Sprockets:\n\nhttp://www.hopsandsprockets.com\n\nNot sure if they have reopened to walk ins yet.\n\nGood luck!!",

            "comment": "Not sure if this would help, but have you looked into CSU Fully Online courses? You can only take 1 per semester, but the program consists of all the online courses that you could take at another one of the CSUs (and all or nearly all of the CSU campuses participate so there is often a number of classes to choose from). It\u2019s easy to filter the search for what you\u2019re looking for, though you may need approval to get the course approved with your major\u2014 I would recommend emailing your advisor with the class description that you are interested in, along with a similar course at CSULA to use as a swap. \n\nHere\u2019s the link for more information: https://www.csufullyonline.com",

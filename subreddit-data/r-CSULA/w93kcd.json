It will be once we get closer to the beginning of the fall semester. \n\nIf you are living on campus and a first year then you cannot get a parking pass for the resident parking, and unfortunately you cannot parking in the other lots over night. Also, you need a special permit to park in the surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nIf you are not living on campus then you don\u2019t have to worry about that and you can buy a permit when the fall semester begins no matter what year you are.",

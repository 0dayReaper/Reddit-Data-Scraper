    "postText": "My name is Daniel, and I am looking to move into an apartment near campus or at l least in the LA area. If anyone has any rooms for rent or is interested in becoming roommates please message me. I have a lot of commitments so I'm not home all that often. I'm a film student so when I am home I love to watch movies. I am very organized and clean. I'm not rowdy or noisy, and am respectful for the most part. Interested in either male or female roommates. Lmk!",

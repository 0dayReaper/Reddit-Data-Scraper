When I decided to return was close to 5 years later, and decided to try it part time. I did great the first semester but the moment I took math i ended up getting overwhelmed and dropping it, and almost giving up all together. My friend who was giving college a shot who is two years older than me stayed in that math class and passed, and he told me just stick it out to the end and you will be fine. I ended up doing that with math and stats and barely scrapped by. From then on I was often going upwards with my grades minus two C's I got in my first online classes (prepandemic) and the last few semesters I have been on the part time Deans list. I'm Majoring in Global Supply chain operations  &amp; management.",

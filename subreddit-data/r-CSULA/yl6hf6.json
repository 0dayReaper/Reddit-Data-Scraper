I have found there to be a decent amount of online offerings, but that is totally dependent on the major. \n\nhttps://www.calstatela.edu/sites/default/files/groups/University%20Registrar/Docs/2233_courses2.pdf",

If you look at the link for the schedule of classes, they\u2019ll list \u2018online\u2019 in the Bldg/Room column. There\u2019s also a way to search for online options in GET as well.\n\nEdit: You\u2019re welcome!",

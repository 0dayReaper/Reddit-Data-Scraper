    "postText": "I am looking into Open University as a post-bacc before applying to grad school to bump my GPA. Admissions/Faculty members have recommended doing this to prove a case for myself(bad undergraduate GPA)\n\nHow easy it is to get into upper-division/elective Biology science classes now under Open University? Have impaction/waitlists creeped into upper division classes? Is it hard to get classes at the upper division level? I remember it was only lower division classes that were hard to get. \n\nAre there any deadlines to keep in mind? I am looking into starting in Spring or Summer at the soonest next year.",

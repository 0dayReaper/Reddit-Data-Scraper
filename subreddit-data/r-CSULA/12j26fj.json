So if for example every graduating person for your college registers and claims their 4 tickets, then your college will have no tickets left and so a pool won't open up for any remaining tickets.\n\nIt sucks, especially since the graduation is in a Parking Lot, so I see no reason for limiting the number of people you're allowed to invite.",

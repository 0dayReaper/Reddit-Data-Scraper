CSULA really doesn't care about their student body. They don't care about the adversity we had to face to collect our degree. We're just dollar signs to them. I wish I could get refunded for my cap, gown and hood. We're just gonna go and roast in the sun. Is anyone actually gonna go??\n\nEdit: ASI Survey  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc86fCZk5Vxx62d2jNVdNB0lto5VFGpVAPhzj1zuOiVHnmj3Q/viewform",

    "postText": "So I still haven\u2019t received mine and I don\u2019t care to call anymore because they told me they have to make cap space&amp; other reasons  for students in order to disburse the rest when I called three weeks ago. I\u2019m just checking to see if anyone if you got it yet since it is the end of the semester. I\u2019m hoping this thing doesn\u2019t go until next semester.\n\nUPDATE: I received mine (they lowered it by half) yesterday 6/8/23. So if you haven\u2019t received yours there\u2019s still hope and they\u2019re still processing after the spring semester",

I have moved on with the understanding that I won\u2019t get it, If I it will be a pleasant surprise. \n\nI met with the financial aid rep who was in charge of making the cap space. She said essentially there was no way to legally do it within their system without causing bigger issues. This was 3weeks ago, she told me the FA hold on my account would be removed at the end of the semester and would not impede class registration for upcoming semesters.",

Waited and finally the shorter Hispanic women, on the younger side called me in. She pulled up my account and essentially said that Cal State had to finalize FA package when the MCS was still getting figured out. \n\nThose who didn\u2019t takeout any or just a portion of the FA loans are pretty much the only ones who would still have space to absorb the MCS. That\u2019s because in the system they still had a \u201cFA need\u201d that wasn\u2019t met. That why if you search some people only got a small fraction of the MCS they where supposed to get, they got what the system allowed and the rest was for a lack of a better word, forfeited. \n\nFor those that got all the MCS, they probably didn\u2019t many grants or other FA so the need was there in the system.\n\nThe FA Adviser admitted this was a shitty situation for both the school and students because the original MCS issues was not their making but they had to deal with it the best they could. They couldn\u2019t leave the FA Packages open for each student since that would force them to withhold all financial aid per the hold it would have created.\n\nI hope I summed this up well\u2026.",

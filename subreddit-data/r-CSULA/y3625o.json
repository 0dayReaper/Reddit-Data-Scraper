    "postText": "I applied for CSULA for fall 2023 to transfer from a community college but I realized the application process never asked me for my transcript. I applied to go for CIS. not sure if that factors into anything. I also read in one of their emails that I don't need to submit a transcript until they request but idk kinda seems weird they did not ask for it. help?\n\nAlso, when should I get an acceptance/denial letter?",

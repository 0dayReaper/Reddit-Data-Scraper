I'm worried that it will drop to a D and my acceptance will be rescinded. If it drops to a D will I be able to retake the course at a community college etc? I really don't know where to ask about this.",

Some actions that you can do now (from what I know):\n\n\\- You can retake the class at CSULA in your freshman year or if you do \"early enrollment\" (summer math and english classes offered by CSULA to incoming freshmen for free).\n\n\\- You can \"note\" something out in your application form. For example you can explain why you failed a class and for them to consider you for admission nonetheless.\n\n\\- You can even reach out to the admissions office for more advice (email, phone call, and in person): [https://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/contact-us](https://www.calstatela.edu/admissions/contact-us) (webpage with their contact info).",

The reason being that credits take time to transfer so if you did a course during the summer at a CC, it wouldn't come in time to the university for you to take the next class at the university.",

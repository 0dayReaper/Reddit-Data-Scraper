    "postText": "I just got into the BSN Nursing program for Fall 2022. I am from the bay, so I would live in the dorms. I am a transfer student, meaning this is my 3rd year in college. I heard the food in the food court was kinda bleh, but I was curious about the student life. What are the frats and sororities like? Is this a good place to party? What is the dorm life like? I wanna do my schoolwork, but I love the outgoing lifestyles and going out on the weekends etc., so is this a fun place to live? I know it is a commuter school, so anyone wanna share their dorm experiences?",

            "comment": "Hey ,you can be as involved as you want to be . There aren\u2019t an abundant amount of frats or sororities that like to party but there are a few and that\u2019s more than enough . Also , Downtown LA, pasadena , and alhambra all have thriving nightlife scenes and they\u2019re all less than 5 miles from campus , so there\u2019s honestly nothing stopping you from having a fun experience . There definitely won\u2019t be dorm parties all the time , but there are college parties especially if you link with the right sororities , there\u2019s one in particular that I know of.",

That\u2019s the kind of environment I like being in. Seen so many people wanting the party experience and if you\u2019re looking for that then it\u2019s the wrong place. Great connections, good friends, etc but if people want that tv experience then idk. The beauty of it is what you make of it",

The girls are very sweet and welcoming to everyone, a lot nicer than sorority girls at some other schools. There are several frats on campus and they always invite all of the sorority girls to their parties. The parties are fun if that\u2019s what your interested in there\u2019s usually also a lot of people from other schools there too. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.",

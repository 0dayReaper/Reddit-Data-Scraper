From my experience, the poorer reviews are usually due to the quality of work the professor expects. I know that Fernando has been teaching for YEARS at CSULA. Since Fernando has been at CSULA for quite literally - a very long long long time - it might be good to build connections with a professor like that. If you are interested in graduate school or applying for a research position after school, Fernando would be a great reference (just food for thought). \n\nI hope to see you in class :)",

I've also heard that about her from past professors too, she seems great but when I was checking her reviews, I wasn't sure lol. I was looking at her 3250 class that's online so I might just enroll in that one. Thank you sm :)",

            "comment": "Hi!! I took Gathri this past semester and she works with students a lot. Specifically her 3250 class, you need to come up with a plan and make sure to execute it by the end of the semester. A lot of her work is based on the readings she provides so make sure to keep up on that. She wasn\u2019t very clear from the beginning of the semester on what she wanted and expected by the end of the semester so make sure to ask lots of clarifying questions. She was honestly a bit rude and insensitive at times so just watch out for that. Definitely study and coordinate with your classmates. I took Kohatsu last year and he was also a bit rude and abrasive. He would get really frustrated when we would ask questions and would be passive aggressive. I\u2019d recommend not taking him but the class isn\u2019t impossible to pass. Let me know if you have any more questions :D",

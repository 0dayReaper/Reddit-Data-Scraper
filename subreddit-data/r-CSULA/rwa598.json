When the spring 2022 courses were released almost none were online and I feel like that isn't necessarily fair to those who have to pickup and move back to LA if they don't live anywhere near school. Also, not everyone is comfortable with the current situation regarding COVID. Those who want to go back should be given the options and those who don't should be given an option too. Obviously classes will fill up depending on your registration date, but at least they would be able to waitlist.",

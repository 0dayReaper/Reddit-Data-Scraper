I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a commuter school for the most part and a lot people are shy or either don\u2019t know how to speak up. If anything is looking for a friend, haha im all ears. I\u2019m a transfer student, going into education. I love hikes, going out to eat, love going to the beach, pretty easy going when it comes to anything.",

    "postText": "Hello,  it's Dr. Josef Velten here, starting up a repair cafe here because it brings together my love of tinkering and my environmentalist  streak that wants to have nothing thrown away if it can be used.  Now  that I got space and the blessing of the folks at Cal state LA's makerspace, I'm  setting up shop fixing your stuff you've got broken, and teaching anyone  who wants to learn how to fix stuff, all for the low low cost of having  to hear me chatter while I work.\n\nIf  anyone would like to help, I'd love for y'all to spread the word, as I  have absolutely zero advertising budget for this, and I'm sure there are  people in your college/department/discords/group chats/whatever who  might need some help fixing it, and if you could copy/pate the paragraph  below into those places, it'd be appreciated:\n\nCal State LA's  makerspace is now holding a weekly repair cafe in the main room of the Makerspace (ET 111B) from 12:00-4:00 p.m. every Wednesday for the semester.\u00a0 A   repair cafe is where you come to fix up your personal goods, like   electronics, (replacing phone batteries/screens, diagnosing and fixing   laptops) and other things that might be in need of repair.\u00a0 This is a   completely free service and the only thing you need to pay for is any   parts you might need to be replaced, and we can help you with diagnosing   what parts you need, and where to find them.\u00a0 If you are interested in   learning practical repair, you are invited to come down and learn/join  our team, no experience needed.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nWe  fix your stuff for free, all you need to do is bring your stuff and get  any repair parts.  100% money back guarantee (and by that I mean no  guarantee)\n\nAnd yes, with the tools  at the makerspace, I'm pretty sure we can do diagnostic/repair of board  level problems i.e. if you overclocked your video card and burned it,  we might be able to fix it, don't toss it just yet.",

I'm always looking to expand this, or in a sunshine and puppy dogs scenario, to let it be taken over by students and I just help out instead.",

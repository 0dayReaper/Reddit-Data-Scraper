    "postText": "I am trying to drop 2 classes in order to be a part time student because I can not afford to pay 1.2k. I payed 500 for my other classes already. How do I drop? I understand I have to do a form but will they accept my reasoning as can not afford it. Do i also just email it to the teachers of the classes I am trying to drop. Also how do I get the Department chairs signature?",

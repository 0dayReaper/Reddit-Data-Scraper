I don't know much about CSULA but at other schools there was always a point that I needed a student ID card.\n\nIs this because it's such a commuter school? Do you just come to class and go straight home?",

You need it to get into the rec room I'm sure but I haven't gone to that in years since I have a home gym now. I only go to class when I have one in person, then I come home. But shit, I'm in my last year so I want to get one to continue to get discounts at places long after I graduate. I went to CSULB in 2014 and still use my ID from there for discounts but it's all faded and I don't think places will accept it anymore lol",

            "comment": "Hello~ I'm a fashion major at Cal State LA. We learned lots of fashion history. We also learned how to use the industrial machine (which is alike to a home sewing machine), Different ways to make designs like crocheting, knitting, dyeing. The professors are really helpful, they will help you prepare for your fashion career. They will help you to prepare your portfolio and establish your fashion website or social media. You will also learn the impact of fashion in our world or social problems created by fast fashion. You also have to take some art classes or digital design classes. All the classes you have will help you fit into your fashion career.\n\nApologies for the late response, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.",

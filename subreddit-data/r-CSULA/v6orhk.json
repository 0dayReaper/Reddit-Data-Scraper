    "postText": "Hello! I'm an incoming graduate student at CSULA. Currently, I'm still looking for housing options. Specifically nearby campus or a way to take the bus/other forms of transportation (a shared house for example) to get to campus. I'm a female, vegetarian and prefer rooming with other vegetarians who are also females and possibly graduate students as well if possible. For now, I have submitted a housing application and am hoping for a single since I would like my own room (how likely is it to get a single? \ud83d\ude05), but I am still open to off-campus housing. Please me if you have furher details on housing or just in general for CSULA (safe neighborhoods?)",

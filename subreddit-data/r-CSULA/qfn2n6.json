    "postText": "Hello fellow CSULA folx! I am back to remind you all of an amazing opportunity to make positive change in our community and gain experience in the field of education. Step-Up tutoring is a non-profit that serves to provide students (grades 3-6) in under-resourced communities with free tutoring and mentor services. As a volunteer, your commitment would require 2, 45-minute sessions per week with your student. The best part: you can tutor whenever you are available! Step-Up personally matches our tutors with students according to their availability, so scheduling will be a breeze. If you are interested, please visit the link on the attached flyer and DM me personally so I can further assist in the onboarding process. I hope you all have a great week and good luck with all of your courses! \n\n[www.stepuptutoring.org\\/tutor-application?275](https://preview.redd.it/w69c83h73nv71.png?width=3882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dd18319a16fb0169503906e427845bac69f5b73b)",

    "postText": "I\u2019m an incoming freshmen but I\u2019m still weighing my decisions if either going to community college or committing to here. I submitted my FAFSA back in November but it says I don\u2019t have any aid from the school for this year. I live with a single parent that makes $45k per year and the counselor said based on that aid, I should be getting a decent package to go to CSULA. Will I expect the package to arrive before I can choose to commit in May or am I 100% not getting anything at all?",

    "postText": "Hi, guys. Today I got accepted into CSULA for pre-psychology :)). I applied to three other schools so it\u2019s not a guarantee that I\u2019m going to this specific one. What are the general opinions on this school? How about the dorms?",

            "comment": "Congrats! I can tell you from first hand experience how the dorms were for my first year.\n\n-They\u2019re apartment style, so you\u2019ll get a basic apartment. Your room is going to have a desk and bed. Theres also a kitchen w/ stove, fridge, and dishwasher. And lastly a shared bathroom space. I\u2019d recommend learning to cook, especially on weekends.\n\n-Your first year you\u2019re most likely not going to get a solo room unless you have a medical reason, so get used to living with a roommate. Be vocal about your lifestyle habits and respect theirs. Communication is key, so talk it out if you have issues that you may have.\n\n-The food plan is ok. The dining hall food is alright taste wise. It\u2019s buffet style so you can eat however much they\u2019re serving. Theyre only open for brunch on the weekends, so you\u2019ll have to learn to cook or go out during those times.\n\n-Social life is okay. I wasn\u2019t really interested in dorm activites TBH but i had more fun interacting in the school clubs. Make friends with your roommates too. Offer to watch a movie, play some games, etc. Not too sure about greek life but school club let me meet people and have them over at the dorms.\n\n-Wifi is okay and free. It gets the job done and can serve as a basic amenity. There\u2019s a special wifi for gaming consoles/streaming devices like Roku thats a little better, but youll need to contact IT to help you. There\u2019s a printer in the community center for 10 cents a page.\n\nTheres a lot more to the college experience, so make the most out of it. Congrats again and feel free to DM if you have more questions!",

I\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t be able to make friends, so I\u2019m hoping my roommates will be my first ones there lol. Also, lucky for me, I love to cook hahah.",

            "comment": "I might be biased but I\u2019m a senior and I think this school is horrible. I obviously have nothing to compare it to but you grow tired of student protesters and salespeople in the walkway trying to get you to sign up for donations. The semester system sucks compared to the old quarter system. We recently had 2-3 school shooting threats in a week and the college refused to cancel classes. Might be different if you major in psychology but as a finance major all my professors are foreign with bad accents. A lot of them are smart but more of them are just too smart to know how to teach. The food court is pretty basic. It\u2019s hard to make solid friends because it\u2019s a commuter campus with everyone living in different directions.\n\nPros IMO is that they give away a lot of financial aid and you get access to a free gym. Can\u2019t really speak on dorm life. I am somewhat of a pessimist when it comes to CSULA though so don\u2019t take just my word for it.",

            "comment": "I\u2019d like to add onto what /u/SweetNaem said, I think it\u2019s a great school, with a very large,  mixed pool of students. I\u2019ve only visited the dorms but they\u2019ve always seemed nice in my opinion. Also, the clubs are very nice and will net you tons of connections for say, classes, friends, and even work! Currently I work on campus and it\u2019s nice, it doesn\u2019t yield great profit but it\u2019s enough to pay for gas every month and that\u2019s all I need. The Greek life is very active at this school, and in my opinion fun ! I joined a fraternity my first semester and have enjoyed it since. Also, another benefit is that there\u2019s a very large amount of different professors for each class you have to take, one of the benefits of a large school, which means you can be sure to check their reviews before enrolling for a class! As for the actual education, I\u2019ve had zero issues with any professors thus far and have really enjoyed it. The school does use Canvas which (admittedly) took me a while to get used to but once I figured it out, it turned out to be a great tool to help keep my classes and their respective material/assignments organized and accessible. That\u2019s pretty much it! I wish you luck in your endeavors, and hope you consider becoming a Golden Eagle!",

IMHO always use \"Ratemyprofessor\" you dont want to end up in a class where its not exciting and falling into bad habits of not attending. Take in mind, its college, the perspective is you are going there for a education first, so be mindful of the classes you take. I definitely have made some friends along the way, but it's mostly hanging out when we are on campus, and occasionally having lunch. \n**Within Psychology classes; NOT ALL classes are offered every semester. So speak to counselors and pickup classes when you can. **",

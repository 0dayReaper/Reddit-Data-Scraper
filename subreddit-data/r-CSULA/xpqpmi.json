Usually you can go on the CC\u2019s website and it will tell you how to order a transcript. Just make sure you send it to the right CSULA address, which I believe is Admissions &amp; Records but double check to be sure.",

Fill out the information then electronically send them to CALStateLA\u2019s admission and records office. It should be this address when you see it. Just double check when you do it! \n\n5151 State University Drive \nLos Angeles, CA \n90032",

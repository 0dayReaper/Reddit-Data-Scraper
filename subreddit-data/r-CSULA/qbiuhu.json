I\u2019m in a similar situation where the program requires at least three semesters but there are not courses here that will help me fill the requirement. First thing I saw when I transferred here. \n\nI would look into whether any local community colleges offer them though, that\u2019s how I have two under my belt. Tsch\u00fcss!",

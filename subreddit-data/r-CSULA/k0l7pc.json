It's a food assistance program, which to my knowledge has involvement with LA County and the USDA, so it's all legit, and I hear it's supposed to be nice, quality food as well, with different options to pick from.\n\nAnyways, I caught wind of it and wanted to share to help any and all of my Los Angeles peeps. I don't want this pandemic (or the cost of school\u2026) to make any of us go hungry\n\nIf y'all got any questions, I can find out more info for y'all! And share this where you can!!! Tell anyone who may need or want some food, there's more than enough to go around!\n\n[Here's the link to the service](https://apply.jointangelo.com/lastudents/index.html) I believe to do need to download this \"Tangelo\" app, which is the program's company's app, but i've heard signup is quick (&lt;5 minutes) and simple (I'm not in LA County rn, so I can't confirm for myself)\n\nBut yeah, much love to y'all, and fight on \ud83d\ude09\u270c\ud83c\udffc",

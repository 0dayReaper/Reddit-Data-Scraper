    "postText": "Hi All, \n\nSAP goes out soon. My pace of completion was 75.37%. This spring semester I passed all my 3 classes except (A\u2019s &amp; B\u2019s) except for one. I\u2019ve never been on SAP warning, or probation at CSULA before. Now I\u2019m worried because I was offered a Summer Pell Grant, and if my pace of completion falls below 75% I\u2019m not sure what happens next? Will I have to pay out of pocket?",

(I'm working part time and may or may not be able to make certain classes). How is her overall class structure? Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "I\u2019m in her 4840 class right now on Thursday nights. She\u2019s a great professor. Super understanding and lenient. I have a weird scheduled and sometimes I can\u2019t show up in person for every class so she makes zoom available for when certain students can\u2019t attend. Sometimes I go to class and sometimes I don\u2019t, it has not affected my grade because she understands that people have lives. My class is from 6-9pm but usually she finishes lecturing by 7:30 and you have a choice on if you want to stay and do work/get help or if you want to go home. She also gives extra credit for answering questions in class. The material is dense to read through but the class doesn\u2019t have an overwhelming amount of hw. usually some hw is due every few weeks. We don\u2019t have midterms or final but we do have short open book/open note tests every couple weeks. usually about 5-10 questions long.",

    "postText": "Hi guys, I'm a prospective grad student waiting to hear back from my program. \n\nI was very confused about financial aid, and am realizing now I am late sending in my FAFSA. For some reason I thought I had to be enrolled to send my FAFSA, so i was waiting to hear back. Will this effect my application, or my chances of receiving aid? Has anyone been in this situation before?",

Csula is the one who also makes the decision to give that to you, so hopefully, they'll still give you the full amount. Things that could affect that is yknow number of students enrolling, of course, those who submitted on time, and their budget.",

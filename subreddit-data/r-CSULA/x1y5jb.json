So I highly recommend we should do something about it like how can they charge about $400 permit every semester and everything else too expensive when in fact, we are studying to become successful. We\u2019re nothing more than product to them. So I don\u2019t pay ticket, let them go collection agency and then remove them through credit financial protection bureau",

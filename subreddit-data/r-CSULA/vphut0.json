What was an average day like as a CSULA nursing student? is it easy to make friends? Are the students supportive of each other?  \nDoes the program offer support systems for students who have difficulty with their classes? (Tutoring, course retakes, etc.)  \nWhat are the classes like? Professors?  \nThank you so much in advance!",

            "comment": "Hi! I\u2019m currently in the traditional bsn program here and just finished my first year! It\u2019s really awesome! I\u2019ll explain an average week in the program. For my first two semesters here, we packed all 3 classes in one weekday, and then each person has an additional clinical day to spend at the hospital. The hospital you are given varies, for us they did a survey of which day we wanted in addition to proximity. The hospitals I did my clinicals at were 5-10 minutes away from my house which was very convenient since we were asked to be there around the hours of 5-7am. It is fairly easy to make friends, especially within your clinical group since those are the people you will be spending majority of your time with in your first year. For support systems, I really advise to make a study group, especially for classes like pharm which have huge study guides. I believe you are only given one course retake throughout your tenure here but I may be mistaken. The professors are very nice, impactful, and understanding. In my personal experience they went above and beyond to help me stay in school while I was dealing with grief and loss. So far I would say pharmacology was definitely the most difficult class. For clinical days, the nurses will have you help them do tasks such as checking blood sugar, dressing changes, feeding patients, giving injections, changing patients, passing meds and much more. For the days you are on campus, it is very draining being there all day, so I would definitely buy or pack snacks, and also majority of the students here invested in an iPad which works wonderfully while you add notes to all the PowerPoints. I hope I helped and if you have any other questions you can dm me!",

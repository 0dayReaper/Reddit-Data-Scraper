    "postText": "Heyyy. I was recently accepted into CSULA for Art in an option for fashion. I was wondering if anyone is in that program and could give me your experience with it so far. I really choosing between CSULA or community college to transfer to another school for fashion design (hopefully CSULB). Anything helps! I'm just trying to get a feel for the program because I cannot find anythingggg about it anywhere.",

Not a fashion student but I am in the Arts and Letters college which is where art, foreign languages, English etc.. major students are, and if your ultimate goal is to transfer to CSULB, I'd say just go to a cc. It'll most likely be in nicer conditions than our campus, and you'll have more resources available, the ability to take more fun courses, and the tuition is going to be way cheaper. From what I hear, the art students/film students don't like the lack of guidance and help for building their careers outside of school. If you want to connect with fashion students though try and find some csula Discord groups, they're usually more active.",

Especially if your in the area as you can get your first 2 years at CC free through FYE.\n\nAlso you probs have already done so, but I'd say to double check if your major isn't impacted at CSULB. That way you won't have to wait for classes",

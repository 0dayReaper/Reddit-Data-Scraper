    "postText": "Does anyone else feel csula is too woke? Assignments from all of my GE classes favor one political side, and their ideologies, and they make you agree with those ideas to be able to complete those assignments. I don't understand why students are put through this rather than letting students focus on their major. On top of it, we are required to take social and ethnic classes, which I can't imagine how it would be. I just want to learn stuff within my major, and that's it. I understand that some ge classes are helpful, like English, communication, etc. And they make you a well-educated/rounded person, but why am I forced to take courses that aren't related at all?",

If you feel you are being unfairly graded in your coursework or you feel unable to express yourself (respectfully), you should reach out to your academic advisor for help. \n\n2. All colleges and universities, regardless of \u201cwokeness,\u201d require you to take a diverse set of GE\u2019s. This serves two functions-it expands your knowledge and viewpoints, giving you more critical thinking skills *and* it gets you to look at other majors and possibly switch if you find something you\u2019re more passionate about. Once you know your degree path and start taking upper division courses, they are all focused on that field. Trade schools avoid this path entirely for people who know the profession they want to get into and are a fantastic option for many people.",

CSULA is one of the most diverse campuses in the CSU system and also has an older student base. So maybe this is what your seeing being reflected in your coursework.   \n\n\nHowever, all CSU's have similar lower and upper-division GE patterns. CSU's make you take social/ethic classes while UC makes you take a foreign language.    \n\n\nThe social and ethnic classes were some of the best classes I took during my short time at CSULA (I transferred elsewhere because I was no longer pursuing the major I went to CSULA specifically for not because of any issue with the university)",

I have a hard time too when coming here since I don\u2019t live near by and im alone here. But I still make the time to clean up after my space. \n\nWe have all cleaned up after her or understand that sometimes we are busy with school or work.  we all  have responsibilities and should respect the space we are in SINCE WE RENT and any damages that happen, we will pay for. \n\nThere is a difference between having a hard time and just not being respectful. And sadly after conversations, it\u2019s just the lack of self awareness. We have completely been considerate about her and her needs but after almost of year of no change it\u2019s really difficult, we too get tired of cleaning after messes that we don\u2019t cause. Especially when she does not contribute anything as far as house needs and doesn\u2019t clean.",

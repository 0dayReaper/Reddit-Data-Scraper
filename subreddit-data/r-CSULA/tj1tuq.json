    "postText": "I am currently working on declaring my major in Psychology but I need a 3.0 GPA. I am sitting at a 2.8 right now, and my advisor said that if I don't get straight A's this semester, I have to change my major. My plan was a major in Psychology and then a minor in Sociology. My advisor said that I can change my major to Sociology, but she really didn't tell me that there was a certain time that I needed to declare my major.\n\nI don't really mind being a major in Sociology, but it just bothered me that I had my whole future set with Psychology but I guess I can still go to graduate school and pursue Psychology.\n\nBut I was wondering, does anyone know if I can declare a major in Sociology, and then change back to Psychology?",

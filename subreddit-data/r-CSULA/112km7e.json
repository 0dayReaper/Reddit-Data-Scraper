    "postText": "We are the least known CSU. We desperately need to revamp our school spirit and identity.  Eagles as a mascot are lame and overdone. I mean I was a freaking eagle in elementary school. I have also never seen an eagle in so SoCal area. But what have I seen? Well, if you head to Angles State Forrest (which can been seen from our campus) you will find a plethora of newts. Yes people, newts. Tons of them, and they are absolutely magnificent. Specifically the California Newt. College is the time to get weird with mascots. The UCSC banana slugs, the UCI anteaters. These are examples of some sick mascots. The CSU Los Angeles Newts! Say it, shit rolls off the tongue. Please respond as I would like to get the genera consensus for my initiative.",

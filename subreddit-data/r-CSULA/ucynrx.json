Montebello can be another decent city to live in. Alahambra is nice if you have the cash to sustain it. Just keep your wits about you and make friends with your neighbors you should be fine",

            "comment": "In general, nowhere on Earth is 100% safe. Is it possible that you'll get robbed or killed in broad daylight? - yes, the possibility exists. Is it likely - most likely not. The element of danger will always be present, no matter where you are. The best thing you can do is take precautions so as to not \"invite\" bad actors to see you as an easy target. \n\nUnless you're particularly targetted by someone, I would say that most crimes are crimes of opportunity. Be vigilant and aware, don't be an easy target and you'll be fine. I've lived here in LA all my life and I've been fortunate enough to not have been robbed or assaulted, and I grew up in South Central.\n\nI'll probably get downvoted for this, but if you're looking for places in particular, stay North East of CSULA and you'll be fine -- Monterey Park, Alhambra, Pasadena, San Gabriel Valley, Temple City, Glendale, Arcadia, and El Monte.",

It's really helpful. \n\nI've always lived in a small town and I've never really had to worry much about crime or anything in my life so it's been taking getting some used to. \n\nWe don't even lock the doors of our cars and leave the keys in them at my moms place so we can move them around whenever. \n\nJust a completely different world down here. \n\nSo I've been really good about it mostly, I just sometimes when I'm dead tired and it's late at night I'll forget to do something and it's been giving me lots of anxiety. \n\nAlso there is like a police helicopter at least 3 times a week at like 3am at night. \n\nNeighbors screaming bloody murder in the middle of the night. I don't think I've slept since I got to LA.\n\nSo I've been looking for quiet neighborhoods in particular.",

There will always be bad pockets in these cities, but just speaking from experience, you're mostly good here.\nFinding affordable rentals would be rough, but I recommend the Atwater Village, Eagle Rock neighborhoods of LA. Maybe check for subletting or room rental options for something a little cheaper.\nHighland Park, Glassell Park are bit more hit or miss. Definitely depends on the street or neighborhood at this level.",

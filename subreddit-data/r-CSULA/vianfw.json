Everyone one is invited and feel free to share this to other discord servers or classmates that is interested in cyber security or who just interested in technology in general. I will try to make this club engaging and interesting for everyone. So feel free to give suggestions and feedback so we can so we can have things ready when the school approves us.  \n\n\nDiscord Link: https://discord.gg/YmQGqgatTn",

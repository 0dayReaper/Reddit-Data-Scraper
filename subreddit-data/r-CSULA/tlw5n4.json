But for the most part because a lot of students are transfers and the campus is really diverse a lot of counselors are good at working with those circumstances.\n\nThe counselors at the College of Natural and Social Sciences (NSS) were really good. I was a psychology major so that was my college. \n\nIf you know what major(s) you're looking into you can always check out the school's website and see what college it belongs to.",

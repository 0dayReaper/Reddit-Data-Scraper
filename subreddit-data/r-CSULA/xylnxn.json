            "comment": "The title of the scholarship has nothing to do with your socioeconomic class. It's usually given to those who have finished all their financial aid either it be your Pell Grant, Cal Grant or both, and you still haven't completed your degree. Also keep in mind that the money is to cover tuition and fees only so it's my understanding that you don't actually receive the money. They school uses it to pay these fees for you.",

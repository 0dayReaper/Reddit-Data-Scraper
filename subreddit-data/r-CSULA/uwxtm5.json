If you are only receiving a Pell Grant, you actually don\u2019t get a disbursement because if you are taking only 6 units, the Pell Grant will only pay for 50% of your tuition. \n\nUse [this](https://www.calstatela.edu/financialaid/summer-2022-cost-worksheet) spreadsheet to figure out how much you will have to pay for summer classes. I\u2019d also recommend calling the financial aid office for your specific schedule if you have any more trouble.",

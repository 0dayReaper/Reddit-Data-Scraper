So then I applied again, and put the \u201claptop\u201d option, and received an email confirmation. But now I am worried I won\u2019t get the hotspot when that\u2019s the main thing I am in need for. Does anyone know if I am able to get a hotspot even if I didn\u2019t fill it out in the application?",

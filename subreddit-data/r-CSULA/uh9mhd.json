    "postText": "Hi, my little brother used to be part of this program around 5-3 years ago and now that he entered middle school we would like to re-enroll him. It wasn't necessarily tutoring, more like supplementary classes. From what I remember it was a 5 month program during school semester and a 3 month program during the summer. This program would happen during the weekends and It took place in the lower levels of king hall. I think the first or basement floors. It was a 3 month long program from what I remember.\n\nI cant seem to find anything about it online so I was hoping someone might know about it. Thanks.",

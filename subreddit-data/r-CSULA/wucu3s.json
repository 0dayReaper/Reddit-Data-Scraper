    "postText": "So I mean hear me out. I have two classes right after one an hour on two completely opposite sides of campus. \nClass A (12:00-1:40) then Class B (1:40-3:00) allll the way on the opposite side of campus\u2026..\n\nIt\u2019s like my fourth year here and I\u2019ve always somehow avoided this but, due to deadlines and certain credits that need to be met, I unfortunately need to take BOTH courses. I get no financial aid for summer or winter so that also is not an option for me. Anyways so I just wanted to know what anyone else did when they were in a situation like this. Did you email professors ? Just leave class 10 minutes early of the first class an attempt to run up and down hills to make it the second class on time? Unfortunately I have no other options UNLESS someone drops or leaves the class from any of the two professors but as of right now both have all their classes full. So\u2026 lol. Just want to know what you guys did in this situation for advice lol.",

Do i still have to send the transcript from that first college if i retook all of the courses at the new one?",

            "comment": "Yes, you have to provide transcripts from all colleges attended. Before you send them in though, I would suggest inquiring about academic renewal at the school where you have the bad grades and GPA and see if those grades can be removed and not counted towards your GPA. That school will probably ask you for the unofficial transcripts from the school where you re-did the courses or equivalent courses so they can see that you've improved.",

It depends on when you're applying and what major you're applying for. I'm a pre-nursing major, and we aren't able to get less than a B on the first attempt for nursing prerequisites. I can't speak on behalf of all majors, so it's something to look into if you are applying for an impacted major. You have to send transcripts from every institution you've applied to. The process for academic renewal can take up to a month (maybe longer) depending on the school, so I suggest meeting with a counselor ASAP to see if you qualify before applying! Best of luck :)",

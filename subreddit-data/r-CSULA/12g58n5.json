    "postText": "Helloo! I am still considering going to CSULA for premed. However, as a CSU I am unsure if it is the best route to choose. It is close to home, however, I believe my award was not the best compared to UCR. I wanted to gain some insight from current students at CSULA. Is premed opportunities possible there? Are the classes/ prerequisites I would need for medschool available ? How about research ? These are just general questions I have but if there are any premed students on this subreddit that go to CSULA what is your experience like?",

If you\u2019re looking to completely ur pre reqs for med school, which is an expensive investment, I recomend csula for its affordability and great professors",

Is this, um... safe? Or is this the kind of situation like when an Amazon employee drops on the warehouse floor and you all gotta work around them?\n\n(spotted in SH building and also the theater building cause i was looking for a bathroom.)\n\n((didn't bother wandering anywhere else other than Student Services building and Golden Eagle building))",

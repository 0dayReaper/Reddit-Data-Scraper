Night biking was awesome, the entire city feels like its yours because no one else is out. It's a very quiet and lonely feeling, but in a good way. I felt free. Then it's fun to bike the same route in the daytime to appreciate the contrast.\n  \nI can't wait to graduate, I hope to move back if I can find work (and a life) back there :)",

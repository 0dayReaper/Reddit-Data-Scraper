Should I try to add classes now or wait till I get advisement from my advisor I'm meeting in a week? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorried classes will get filled up in that time frame but have no idea if it's fine that I can wait a bit more.",

Idk when your enrollment appt was but mine was back at the beginning of November and it was a bloodbath. When I registered 3 hours after my appt was even became available I already was waitlisted for one of the classes. Has happened 3 semester in a row now\n\ngood rule of thumb is to just keep eye out for the enrollment total for the courses you\u2019re specifically thinking about on GET so you can keep track of if they\u2019re still available or when they\u2019re getting close to full if you can\u2019t register for them just yet.\n\nSooner is always better but our school is dumb and forces full tuition before even registering &amp; if you if you can\u2019t rn then definitely as soon as you can whenever you are able to",

Then go from there, because at the end its your education that you are paying for. When I was there,  one of my professors gave us the cold hard facts what to do and this was one of those facts.",

This post may sound kind of stupid, but I was wondering if anyone else on here was interested in joining a group chat or something to meet new people before coming back to campus? I\u2019m a second year this year but I feel that I barely got to meet people last year, and I really want to be more involved on campus and overall meet new people while in school :)  If anyone else is open for it let me know!",

    "postText": "Data collection for my research study on Spartans ends this **Saturday 3/4 at 11:59 pm PST!** Thank you so much if you've already participated or spread the word, but if you are eligible and haven't gotten a chance then there is still time! **Just be sure to include a screenshot from your race data** in the Garmin connect app to be eligible (video instructions link in the survey itself) for a chance to enter the raffle for 1 of 8 free races!\n\nMy name is Gabe Hernandez and I\u2019m a grad student at Cal State Long Beach in my last semester of my M.S. in Athletic Training degree. For my thesis/research project I\u2019ve been conducting a study on Spartan racers who used a Garmin smartwatch in the last 5 years to record their race data. By entering so you can opt-in for a raffle for a free Spartan race in 2023! While this may not be directly applicable to your interests in this subreddit page, I hope that this is able to reach a wider audience so that I may use this data to publish an official article after I graduate and represent the obstacle course racing community in scientific literature. If you\u2019re interested the link for the survey is in my bio, or if you would like more info feel free to DM me. The link is listed below and you can also scan the QR code in this flier!\n\n[https://csulb.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_cYGrm3AoElbzR1s](https://csulb.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cYGrm3AoElbzR1s)\n\n\\*\\*Just to be clear I have been given permission to post this by the moderator team for educational purposes only. This post is in no way an advertisement for my university, Spartan Race, or affiliated with this subreddit.\\*\\*\n\nThanks so much for your time and have a great day!\n\nGabe Hernandez, CSCS, SGX\n\nAROO!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8z8yjjq903la1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=258b2aa15b09a96fcd3f205f1539d6a4beecd117",

    "postText": "Hello I have a question regarding declaring my pre-major. So currently I\u2019m a pre business administration management major and I already finished all my requirements for the pre-major and I have the required gpa but the system won\u2019t let me declare my major. I made an appointment with an advisor previously and they said it should happen automatically. Does this mean I would have to make another appointment with an advisor?",

            "comment": "I think it should be automatic. I received an email today stating that I've been \"admitted to the full major\" so maybe the email is taking a little longer to arrive in your inbox. If not, then yes, definitely make an appointment with an advisor to explain your concerns.",

I don\u2019t know how it works for other majors though. I would check your degree planner to see if you need to.",

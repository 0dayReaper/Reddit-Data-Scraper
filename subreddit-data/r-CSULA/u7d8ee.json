    "postText": "Hi everyone, so decision day is coming soon, and I am still thinking about which school I will be attending this upcoming Fall semester. I have been admitted for the undergrad program at the College of Business and Economics Accounting program. I have looked over each school\u2019s financial offer and they are about the same, but I want to hear what you guys think about the program in general if you\u2019re in the program or if you graduated from here. What have you liked about it? What have you disliked? Professors? Counselors? How\u2019s the academic support? Would you have gone elsewhere? I just want your opinion in general. Thanks, and hopefully I\u2019ll see you guys soon.",

There was never really a line so you were able to go when convenient for you. I do believe you need your school ID handy as that is how they send your COVID test info, the account linked to your School ID. Hope this helps!",

Make sure you checked testing times as they are different depending on the day. I\u2019ve gotten tested at the location off of the main walkway by the library, and I got my results within a couple of days. Hope this helps.",

    "postText": "For my major-specific courses, I have to take ECON 2010 and ACCT 2100. I was advised to take ECON 2010 for Spring Semester 2022, but I originally wanted to take ACCT 2100 *first* to get the gist of what accounting is like. Is it somehow better to take ECON 2010 first? Or can we also take both in the same semester?\n\nThe counselor had said that they originally made students take both in the same semester at the beginning but then advised them to take ECON 2010 first. I asked him this question, and this was the general answer. He didn't really have an exact reason why, but I want to understand from a student's POV. ",

It's a little challenging due to it being on Wiley Plus (a LMS like Canvas, but for your Accounting hw and quizzes and exams) and you really have to study hard to get it.\n\nEcon 2010 is fairly easy, cause it's straightforward and the material isn't as much as Accounting. I actually love it\n\nSo if I had to choose, I'd take Accounting first to get it over with honestly.",

    "postText": "what is the difference between a reference form and a letter of recommendation? I needed a recommendation from 3 specific people and one of them was able to fill out a sheet that calstateapply sent her and wasn't able to submit her letter of rec. When I asked about submitting it separately, they said they are not accepting letters of rec at this time and that it is only the reference form... What does that mean?",

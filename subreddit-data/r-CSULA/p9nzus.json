I can't believe school is starting this week. \n\nWe're making a few changes to the subreddit and have added post flairs to make things a little easier to find for current / future students, as well as changed the user flairs option. \n\nI'm also in the process of creating a resource section with helpful links for new students (e.g. Financial Aid, CAPS, Parking, etc.).\n\nAlso, if you want to connect with more students, I've added the discord link as another tab next to Posts.   \n\n\nThanks! :)",

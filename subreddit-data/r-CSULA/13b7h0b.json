    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI was wondering how double-majoring would work if my primary major is in Business Administration, and I wanted to check out Computer Information Systems. \n\nThe course/department website explaining the Business Information Systems Option states, \"The BSBA (Bachelor of Science in Business Administration) students may pursue this option for a dual bachelor\u2019s degree because it requires only five additional courses.\" \n\nI have a meeting with an advisor soon, but I was wondering if anyone had double-majored in these departments or declared a CIS minor. I was thinking of doing a CIS minor, but then I read the description and got somewhat confused as to how the dual major would only require 5 additional courses.",

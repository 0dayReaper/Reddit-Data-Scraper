    "postText": "Hello all, \n\nI'm a recent transfer student awaiting to start the Spring semester. I received this notification in my portal labeled \"Unusual Enrollment History\" which I've already started resolving early this month. If you're not familiar with this, basically the school is concerned about me scamming them out of grant funding because I have 1. Accepted aid at more than a few schools already and 2. Have not earned credits during one or more semesters at another college. For context, I was disqualified from csu long beach and later boosted my gpa by going back to community college for a few semesters. I've had my class schedule ready since the start of this month but I can't enroll because I have to pay my fees. Also, I can't pay my fees out of pocket so I've been in free fall mode for the past few weeks. The semester already started yesterday and I'm stressed about not being able to enroll in time. I was emailed a link to submit a \"signed statement\" as to why I didn't earn credit for my year at csu long beach, which I've submitted since then. Lastly, I've been notified that I've been placed on SAP warning because I don't have an academic history at csula, but will be given aid for this semester and be considered for future aid upon meeting SAP standards at the end of the Spring. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter all of this, I'd love some insight on 1. Will I be waiting a long time before hearing back on a decision from the FA office? 2. If you have been in this position, were you given an aid package and was it enough to pay for tuition? 3. Depending on the wait time for a response, is it up to to professors to allow me to enroll late into the semester? As this is happening I'm still checking the status of my classes to see if they have available space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading this and for any insight you can offer!",

There\u2019s no \u201chiding,\u201d that wouldn\u2019t make any sense to hide that info. It\u2019s just a lot of burocracy. You could also just ask the professors themselves, contact info is publicly available on the department websites.",

            "comment": "Just a heads up.\n\nYou can take an equivalent Physics 2100 at the LACCD and transfer it in, in case you find that the professors that do offer the course are not ones you want. After you take the course, you can transfer the grade and credit in.\n\nFor example, if you go to [assist.org](http://assist.org) and look at the agreement between CSULA and LATTC, youl'l see that the equivalent is Physics 101.\n\nThis will open up various class offerings and different professors, even find a class on Saturday only, Hybrid, or fully online. I suggest this only because I already did this for physics due to schedule conflicts.\n\nJust keep in mind that CSULA has a cap on the number of transferable courses of [39 semester/ 58.5 quarter credits](https://www.calstatela.edu/undergraduatestudies/articulationtransfer-credits).\n\nHope this helps.",

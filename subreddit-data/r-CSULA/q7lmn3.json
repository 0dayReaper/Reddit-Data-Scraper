Having mostly online classes in Fall has made it a little more tricky meeting people, but it's not impossible. \n\nSo far it looks like Spring is offering mostly/all in-person classes, so there'll probably be more in-person events for clubs and more chances to meet people then",

It was basically a community college that offered four year degrees--people drove in, took classes, and left. Things may have improved but I doubt it.\n\nI really can't recommend transferring to CSULA if you want a social scene. In fact, I don't recommend the school at all--the administration is inept, the social scene sucks and it's in a bad part of L.A. compared to UCLA. If your grades are good enough to go to a private college, that is your best bet. Despite having sky high tuition on paper, the actual cost of tuition isn't that expensive at private colleges with lots of money since their financial aid is more generous and they have less students who need aid in the first place. If your grades suck, try to transfer to Cal State Long Beach. It's an earthly paradise compared to CSULA. If your grades are in between, apply to a UC school and keep CSLB as a back up.",

You need to join a Frat or join a group to socialize. After I did that it\u2019s been a lot better. U will also meet people in ur class to, but it\u2019s not the same :/",

However they do fundraisers or events through the semester, just go up to them and ask, most people are very lead back and hella chill. They are usually located when you\u2019re walking through the main hall, there a bunch of tents and people either trying to get signatures or recruit people. You can also go online on Instagram or Google and find student-organized groups or Frats",

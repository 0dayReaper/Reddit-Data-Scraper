    "postText": "Hello, so I'm currently just having mental health difficulties with everything that is going on with life and school. I don't have much in terms of support at home, so I did want to check out CAPS on campus, but I'm not sure how it is?\n\nI can't afford to seek help outside of school either so I feel like I can only truly turn to campus for some guidance in mental health.\n\nWhat should I expect from CAPS? Is it helpful? Or was it not worth the effort?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you to anyone that takes the time to answer!",

I\u2019ve had therapy elsewhere and it\u2019s never worked for me so I gave up on finding a good therapist until I found those at Caps.",

When I started with my third therapist i was no longer anxious for the first meeting but instead I unloaded all my baggage lol. Don\u2019t feel the need to hold back emotions either. It\u2019s a safe space",

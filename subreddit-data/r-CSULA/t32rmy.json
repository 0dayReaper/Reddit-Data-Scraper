    "postText": "So I took a shot at applying to Cal State LA in November because I want to move to Los Angeles for my career. I go to school in Wisconsin (born and raised), but I've been wanting to leave from here since I was 12. I found out I got accepted as a transfer student for their journalism program, now I'm weighing the pros and cons to see if I should go. I already know about traffic, parking,  but what is housing like on campus? It is better to rent with someone off campus? Is the housing tuition worth the cost? Is the program worth leaving out of state? My family is supporting whatever decision I make, I just didn't think I could ever get accepted to a college out of state.... \n\nAlso I'm 28 going on 29, so I'm a little older than most students in undergrad and I do have experience already professionally in the field.",

            "comment": "copy pasting my response to another post. I would not recommend coming from far unless you have a lot of excess funding or would want to share a room. \nI chose CSULA because their fin aid package was better than the CSU closer to me (CSUCI) but I am really struggling a bit trying to commute even monday and friday and staying in an airbnb during the week while I look for an apartment. If the financial aid is good enough and it is close enough for you to easily commute (I would say within a half hour, maybe up to an hour depending on comfortable your car is) then the campus is nice enough and everyone is nice. \n\nfor reference, you should really expect to pay at least $900-$1000 monthly to have your own bedroom, even with roommates, but even housing like that is not super easy to find.",

I can always get a job to help, in the meantime my family said they would help me (thank god). Did you not want to share a room with someone? I can try to find a place closer to campus I wouldn't mind, but the odds of that as we know won't be easy. I have a basic chevy that I hate but it runs so I could make the drive if I have to commute.\n\nIf you find any sources for places I would love to know, I'm interested in how you've been surviving this whole time. It sounds scary but gangsta at the same time.",

I am happy to be learning in person, personally. i\u2019m thankful that I got really good financial aid now that I am 25, so I can afford to stay in an airbnb part-time for this semester, at least, but if you aren\u2019t afraid of sharing a room it should be easier to find a apartment, and you might even find it more reasonable to stay in the dorms during the school year. They are a bit above market rate, is the only issue, but if you don\u2019t have family or a better situation to stay in nearby, I haven\u2019t heard any big complaints about their dorms like people are making about some of the other big universities these days. \n\nIn terms of apartment housing, my issue is that I have not shared a bedroom since childhood and am limited by bad credit, but if you have a credit score over 700 I think you could more reasonably find whatever type of housing you are looking for and be able to be a bit more selective. I have looked through craigslist, trulia and apartments.com mostly and have viewed some nice places. \n\nI will say, also keep in mind that CSULA is not in what could be considered the \u201cheart\u201d of LA, it is in a more suburban area, at least 20 minutes drive east of any area that outsiders would know by name or anything you would have seen on TV or social media. That is the californian perspective though, if you are from a place where you have to drive 15+ minutes to the grocery store or anywhere similar, that won\u2019t bother you at all.",

That's good to hear all my family is here in Wisconsin, and I heard about the credit score thing. I'm in the mid 600's so that rules me out too lol. I noticed where campus was the last few times I visited, it definitely was further from downtown when I saw it on the highway going towards Long Beach. All in all I would have to see what financial aid would look like and housing options, my family is pushing me to go it's just so nerve-racking.",

            "comment": "CSULA is not a super prestigious school. You can get a similar education in Wisconsin if that's what you're worried about. The big question imo is whether you should move to LA or not. If you ask me, the answer is yes. I'm also from the upper Midwest and after moving to LA, I don't think I'll ever go back. There's really no comparison. Weather, diversity, social life, culture, sheer amount of options for whatever you want to do. Yes, the rent is expensive, but it's for a reason. If you want to live somewhere cheap, go to Bakersfield. You'll get what you pay for!\n\nAs for where to live, it sort of depends on your interests and your budget. The school's located in East LA. It's not a terrible area but not ideal either. Don't bother looking south of there unless you're latino (not saying they're bad areas, but you'll get side-eyed as a gentrifier). If you go east you can find cheaper suburbs. If you go north into NELA (Glassell, HLP, Eagle Rock) it's more hipster-y with a lot of good bars and venues, can be sort of expensive these days but worth it if you're into that. I wouldn't recommend going west of the river for now since the commute wouldn't be worth it.",

It\u2019s not a prestigious school (I didn\u2019t even bother applying to those types of schools, my grades aren\u2019t bad at all but I still don\u2019t think they were good enough for those kind of schools). Honestly our journalism program here at my university in Milwaukee seems better, there\u2019s much more journalism and media classes here, minus television production which my associates was in. The city of Milwaukee compared to Los Angeles is the only reason why I considering this transfer. You said it yourself you\u2019re from the Midwest and it\u2019s like a whole new world there. I wanna get into writing for tv shows and movies and doing entertainment news reporter and I just know LA would be the best move. Thank you for the location tips because that\u2019s the main thing I\u2019ve been looking up since I got my offer letter. Sometimes I do wonder if I should\u2019ve tried getting into Cal State Long Beach instead but I think my decision is slowly making itself.",

People who dont like la would DETEST San Francisco. It looks like Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and smells like someone pissed all over it.  Csula is the best economical option, I\u2019ve learned this after being accepted to Csulb and Csusf. Its a good thing that youre on the older side, i can confidently say it helps to have some life experience because csula is without a doubt a commuter school and feeling isolated can be overwhelming to the point where friends sharper than me have dropped out. \n\nOtherwise La delivers sunny weather CONSISTENTLY ,plenty of street vendors in Eastla , Night Market poppin\u2019 in chinatown , Grand Central market In Dtla and Beautiful women in Long beach \ud83c\udf7b",

That being said, it's cheaper to find a cheap room in an urban area and commute. If you're not a snob. I pay 675/mo for my room in Lincoln Heights.\n\nI coincidentally also transferred at 28 on the communication side. Would've applied for journalism if they had it. It was revived fairly recently.\n\nThe university is very friendly, but most people just wanna go home after class. If that's what you're about then it's fine if you wanna leave the same old.",

I'm pursuing journalism, which the professors always seem surprised about. It's an interesting major.

It's urban, but it doesn't feel dangerous to me. Taco trucks and other food trucks abound. Most people mind their business. My only issue is with my room mate who hates me.

In Lincoln heights you can kinda forget its crowded then go into a main road and remember you're in Los Angeles.\n\nAll in all it's a good place to be, but it's not for everyone.",

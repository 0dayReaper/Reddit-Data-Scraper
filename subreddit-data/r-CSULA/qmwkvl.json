    "postText": "Hello All, I am currently a CC student at AVC finishing my GEs to transfer next fall with an ADT in Kinesiology. I was going to apply to transfer this month but I failed anatomy in the summer (I know I'm dumb for that) so now i have to retake it. However, I only have a handful of classes to go. Retaking anatomy my gpa would be increased to a 3.5. I have a job and plan to get my phlebotomy license in the coming year. What are my chances at getting into csula? I am going to apply to various csus, but csula is my first choice so that I can live with my partner who also attends. Thanks guys :)",

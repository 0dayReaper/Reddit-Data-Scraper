    "postText": "I got accepted to CSULA (just waiting to see my financial aid package :\u2019) ) and i had a few questions regarding the campus ! \n\n1. I know this school has a more commuter school environment, how easy is it to make friends? I\u2019m from Central California, so I wouldn\u2019t know anyone at the school. I\u2019m also not a party-person, just don\u2019t want to feel alone \n2. I am majoring in Liberal Studies to be an elementary school teacher, how is the program here? \n3. Are there many on-campus jobs available? I\u2019d want to get a job, and ideally it would be at the school. \n4. How are the dorms? I was looking at the University Apartment Villages online and they look nice, are they okay quality? Does social life feel a bit better in the dorms? \n5. I was interested in joining a sorority, can transfer students join or is it mainly for freshmen? \n6. Is the school isolated? Are there any grocery stores / cafes / restaurants within walking distance? How walkable is the area in general? (I do not have a car)\n7. How safe is the school?\n\nIk this is a barrage of questions but thank u to anyone who answers haha",

            "comment": "1. How easy it is to make friends depends on how you put yourself out there :). I transferred in undergrad and I\u2019m now in the MA program and I met my best friend in undergrad whose still with me in the masters, and some amazing groups of friends who are like family to me. The campus to totally community based if you get involved and dive into campus life :). \n\n2. LBS is a great discipline, I have a few friends who loved it, and you get to take some fun upper division classes out of your discipline (I recommend children\u2019s lit, the instructor is AMAZING)\n3. There are plenty of on campus jobs, make a Handshake account and get your resume on there. \n4. Never lived in the dorms but I hear they are pretty nice \n5. Don\u2019t know anything about sororities, but I do know that the more you get involved, the better. \n6. The campus has a few restaurants, a convenience store, and a few coffee shops. Down the hill there isn\u2019t too much aside from a 7-11 further down, a weed shop and a hot wings place owned by the weed shop (which isn\u2019t half bad to be honest). There\u2019s also trains and busses on campus that you can take to get to downtown or anywhere else you want to go. \n7. School is as safe as any other public campus. During the day, especially when there\u2019s a lot of people, im completely comfortable walking alone with my headphones.  You\u2019re gonna get some weirdos and crazies, but you also have to keep your guard up in general. I would recommend walking in groups at night if you\u2019re on campus. You\u2019re in LA and it\u2019s just not a good idea to be out wandering alone. \n\nHope this helps and welcome the CSULA family!",

            "comment": "Love LBS! I did the general option for undergrad, and I'll second the rec for the children's lit class. :) I think the general vibe for the major is also pretty chill, so it's a good one to make friends in. \n\nTons of on-campus jobs through Handshake. I really enjoyed my time working in the library. \n\nI wouldn't say the area is walkable, BUT there's decent public transportation. If you go North of campus to the Alhambra area there's a Target, CostCo, Pavillions, tons of fast food and restaurants... You won't be stranded. Just Google Maps the Target Alhambra and see what the directions would be like from the dorms area to get an idea. \n\nI'll also echo that the school is as safe as any other. Campus security responds pretty quickly in my experience, but it is LA, so just be mindful of yourself and your surroundings when off-campus.",

            "comment": "I'm from Central Valley too! I'm not going to lie, I've had a hard time connecting with people here bc everyone commutes and wants to get in and get out, and I'm dorming as well. There are on campus jobs, I haven't had much luck though because they'll just decline your application. School is pretty isolated, it's mostly residential and freeways surrounding the school, but Alhambra is the closest city probably with things to do. Safety wise, it's eh. Keep in mind it is more east LA, very very different from small cities in Central Valley so it's a big adjustment. I will say though I'm planning to transfer out of the school because it's not as great here as I was expecting it to be. Hope that helped!",

            "comment": "Everyone kind of keeps to themselves but you can definitely meet people in classes and hang out with them. I can't say anything about the LA program but I know a girl, who's also in a sorority, that is in the process of getting hired to work for an elementary school district. \n\nThere are a lot of on campus jobs available, I personally work at the student union and would recommend finding a job at the union given it's year-round and not seasonal like a lot of the jobs on campus.\n\nThe dorms are nice for the most part. Social life is definitely better if you live on campus and I can see that with the people I know that do live at the dorms/apartments. \n\nIn terms of you rushing a sorority, yes, they take girls of all ages regardless of their year. If you have any questions let me know as I am in a Fraternity and can connect with you some of the girls in different houses. I'd say it's definitely given me that college experience with being connected to a lot of people on campus. It feels like there is always something going on so you never feel like you're alone.\n\nThe area is kind of, but not really walkable. but if you know people you'll always be out with them as I don't have a car either, but mind you I live at my Fraternity house. I'm sure you'd be able to find someone that has a car and ask for rides as a lot of people do that, including me. The school is safe, but it is East LA.",

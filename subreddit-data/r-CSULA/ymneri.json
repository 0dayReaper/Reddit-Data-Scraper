If it covers tuition and expenses then the excess will be awarded to you via a refund check. So just read the specific grants and scholarships to see if you will get that money cashed out to you.",

Sometimes though you won't qualify for other scholarships or if you work a lot if could affect getting things like food stamps. Just depends on what you're interested in, as for the refund specifically, it won't affect that.",

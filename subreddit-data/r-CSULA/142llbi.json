    "postText": "Do you drink alcohol? \n\nThe Addictions Research Laboratory in the Department of Psychology at UCLA is looking for individuals age 21 to 45 who drink alcohol occasionally or regularly (but are not interested in receiving treatment) to participate in a study investigating the role of inflammation in alcohol use disorder (AUD). Eligible participants will be asked to complete two in-person screening visits and one study visit involving an endotoxin challenge, an alcohol cue paradigm, blood draws, a MRI brain scan and questionnaires about mood and alcohol craving. \n\nParticipants will be compensated up to $240 for their time. \n\nIf you would like more information about the study and to complete a telephone screen, please call or text (323) 425-9098 and mention the \u201cEndotoxin Challenge\u201d.",

Faculty is willing to move mountains to help you if you just ask.\n\nNeutral: it\u2019s a commuter school. If you\u2019re partying often then there\u2019s a case you should skip college and just to clubs in your off-time, so this isn\u2019t good or bad really. \n\nCons: some departments are *very* bad. Parking is a hassle (campus PD also *lives* to give you parking tickets), food options are meh, buildings scream late 70s-early 80s and haven\u2019t been updated since then, some class buildings are quite far apart.",

They raised the price on the semester pass in the last year too, but it\u2019s still marginally cheaper than buying a pass each day, iirc the day pass is a little expensive for a whole semester, like $8 I think but can\u2019t remember for certain. If you cluster your classes into 2 or 3 days a week, it might be cheaper though.\n\nIf you can, I recommend you take the train to get to class\u2014having used it and commuting in myself\u2014for two reasons. First, CSULA is the only CSU with a train station on campus which is something unique about it. Second is the cost. Depending on how far you are from campus, the train can be cheaper and/or faster than commuting in and the train also has monthly use passes. \n\nA word of advice though, stay away from union station. I saw more than one assault and battery case while there.\n\nOne more pro is that the counselors are generally helpful. If you get into the honors college (DEFINITELY apply to it if you haven\u2019t already) their counselors are even better, you\u2019ll have a more coherent group of friends you\u2019ll see regularly, you\u2019ll get bragging rights when you go to a job down the line, have access to some financial aid, and you get lounge access.\n\nEdit: since you\u2019re living on campus you also get priority access to dedicated honors housing if you apply for that, which will go a long way to making the stay on campus more pleasant.",

The bike security is spotty at best and there aren\u2019t enough storage locations to begin with. Plus riding them on the school grounds is technically not allowed (but seldom enforced). \n\nYes, affordability is a prominent aspect of most state schools and CSULA is no different. I graduated with no debt which was a *huge* deal. I\u2019m well ahead of most people my age solely because of that. \n\nThink of it this way: is your degree worth going massively into debt for at an Ivy school? You\u2019re majoring in cinematography iirc, so statistically your answer is no. But is it worth getting an affordable degree in it? Statistically, yes. You can\u2019t cancel student debt with bankruptcy nor can you game that system. Debt and money management is a massive part of being an adult, and your schooling almost certainly did not prepare you to weigh the value of potentially six figure debts. \n\nThere are many clubs. Some based on interest, and others based on identity (which when you think about it is a bit racist but w/e). \n\nThe campus feels fine. It feels like any other university I\u2019ve been to. It\u2019s busy on weekdays and has some life on Saturdays during the day, but after 8pm and on Sundays it\u2019s a ghost town. This is the difference between a commuter school and one that isn\u2019t. Since everyone goes home after class, the campus doesn\u2019t have much of a night life. \n\nWhich one is ultimately better is based on a lot of info you should not give me (for your own privacy), your proximity to the school, the quality of the cinematography program, and the odds you can land a job after college in your desired field. I wasn\u2019t a cinematography student so I can\u2019t personally vouch for it, though I did hear from students that were in that program that they found it worth the while. \n\nIf you can, try to make an appointment to get on campus and see it for yourself. Mind you the guide will do everything they can to sell it to you because they want your business, but after the tour you can roam around, ask questions of students currently attending, and even see some of the cinematography faculty (you can look up their contact info and office hours online and get in touch with them too).",

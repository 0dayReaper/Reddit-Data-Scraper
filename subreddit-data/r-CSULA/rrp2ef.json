Getting a test done at the beginning or end of the week just tells you whether or not you\u2019ve infected anyone in the end but doesn\u2019t actually \u201chelp\u201d (if this makes sense).",

The best thing you can do for yourself is get vaccinated and stay safe (wear a mask, stay cautious). It is sad ~~and annoying~~ that some people who are able to be vaccinated continue to choose not to and to that, the school should be coming up with better ways to address that issue.",

I\u2019m referring to students and the school as separate parties. You seem to be referring to America as a whole. I agree that America has a LOT of ignorant and stubborn people. IMO I would prefer that the school mandates vaccines because schools have been doing it for generations, why would it be any different now? But the problem is that they DONT. UNTIL we get to that point, the SCHOOL has to come up with safe solutions for everyone\u2014 vaccinated or not. Believe me, I have no empathy for those that choose not to get vaccinated when they can, but it\u2019s not like YOU or I are able to single-handedly make/enforce those rules.\n\nEDIT : All I know is that the school IS making people get boosters as soon as they can. While people may be able to continue getting exemptions, it won\u2019t do me any good to worry about whether it\u2019s based on true or false information\u2014 especially when the school isn\u2019t making the effort to fully maximize safety for all students.",

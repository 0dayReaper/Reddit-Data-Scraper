I'm a prospective international student looking to apply to CSULA for the MSC Forensic Psychology program. \n\nI wanted to know a little bit about the school and faculty members before I submit my application. \n\nIf anyone could share some info about the program's reputation and the school overall that'd be great! \n\nPlus, are the faculty members for this course helpful? \n\nLastly, what's it like studying at CSULA? Is the crowd friendly? \n\nAny info will be appreciated! Thanks!",

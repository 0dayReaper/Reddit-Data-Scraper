So who knows could be this month or next month. She mentioned it was taking way longer due to new rules and eligibility requirements for the scholarship that were put in place this new academic year.",

It says so in their bio but I didn\u2019t notice until I called and they told me they\u2019re not in charge of that account. I called a couple of times within the past week and when I asked if it would be in by the end of the semester one person said it \u201cshould\u201d and one person said they could not confirm. I\u2019m not hopeful tbh",

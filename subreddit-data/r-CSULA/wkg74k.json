    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m looking for anyone that needs a ride to CSULA Monday-Thursday from Anaheim or nearby areas. I\u2019ll have faculty parking, so you won\u2019t need to pay for part of a parking pass. We can work out gas money.\n\nWhy am I doing this?\n1. Carpooling is better for the environment.\n2. I want to use the carpool lanes on the 5.\n3. Help someone who may not have a car.\n\nI\u2019m a grad student (male 31) at csula working on research on Superconductors, so I have lab work and will be on campus all day. Here is my usual commute timetable:\n\nFrom 11-12am, I\u2019ll usually start heading to csula. Sorry, I can\u2019t do earlier because of my morning job.\nFrom 6-8pm, I\u2019ll usually start heading home.  I am flexible on this if you are taking night classes.\n\nMessage me with if you think this is a good match.",

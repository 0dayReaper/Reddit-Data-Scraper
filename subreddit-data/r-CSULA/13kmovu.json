I don\u2019t mind retaking the class but from what I\u2019ve read from similar posts on the csula reddit some make it seem like it\u2019s the end of the world. Just wondering if there\u2019s been others who went through the same situation and how the process was for them thank you!",

The fact that you've taken it once already, makes the 2nd time easier to understand the material even better, at least I think so. Always use rate my professor to make sure you take it with someone who has great reviews as that usually means that they love teaching the material and in turn will make sure you understand it in the easiest way possible.\n\nBest of luck, you've got this!",

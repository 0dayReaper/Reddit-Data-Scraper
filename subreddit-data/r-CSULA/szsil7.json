    "postText": "Hi ya\u2019ll, I used to go to csula on campus and used to go to cafe 47 often. I would always get their vanilla iced coffees and it was so good that sometimes i didn\u2019t even use creamer cause the flavor was amazing. unfortunately i can\u2019t go anymore since i\u2019ve graduated, but i was wondering if anyone, who has worked there or not, know how it\u2019s made? (or how to get close to it/other places close to it) those vanilla iced coffees were GOOD \ud83d\ude2d",

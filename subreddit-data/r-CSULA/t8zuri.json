    "postText": "Difference between the two is my major question. As of right now i am a computer science major, however i plan on switching due to it being something i\u2019m not really interested in. But i still plan on being in something tech related, so i was looking into GC. How are the classes? What types of topics due you learn? Purpose of the major like the foundation of the courses. Also if your able to provide how are your experiences so far if that\u2019s your major and why you chose it\nThank you in advance.",

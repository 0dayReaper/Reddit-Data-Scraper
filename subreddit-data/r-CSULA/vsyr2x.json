I dont know what is going on in with their housing but someone told me that we should be getting some sort of confirmation some time this week. But everytime i call it's a different date. Previously someone said that we wouldn't know until the week before we move in (August 12th-17th) and now im being told we'll know by this month. They are clearly disorganized and i do not a good feeling about staying on campus.",

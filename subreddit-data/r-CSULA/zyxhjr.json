Also if you log into your GET account and look under \"My Academics\" and then on the right hand side under \"Current Academic Objective\" it should show your expected graduation term which should say Spring Semester 2023, if you're clear to graduate.\n\nEdit To Add: If you haven't yet received an email, then they're probably still reviewing your application or haven't gotten to it yet especially if it was submitted closer to the due date. On their website it states that they should have all applications reviewed by the beginning of the Spring semester.",

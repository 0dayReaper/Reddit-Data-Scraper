Besides the normal Tuition and Fees cost per semester ($3,399.26) you'd also have to add an additional Non-Resident Tuition fees ($396 per unit). So for an undergrad degree per semester you're looking at roughly $8,151.26 for a full 12 unit semester. Of course if you decide to take more units (up to 18) the amount would change only when adding up the Non-Resident Tuition fees. \n\nhttps://www.calstatela.edu/finance-onestop/student-fees",

To be considered a full-time student you would need to take a minimum of 12 units. But if you want to finish your degree quicker, you can take up to 18 units a semester.",

The only ones I can think of would be private universities but even those wouldn't be cheap. \n\nThe cheapest would actually be the CSU's since they're public universities besides of course Community Colleges but those are even a stretch since they also charge international student fees.",

SMC has the highest concentration of international students in the country, And it's near the beach, next to the LA area. Sure, it's a community college, but I had an amazing experience getting my general education done there, before transferring to CSULA.",

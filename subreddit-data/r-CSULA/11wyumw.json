            "comment": "I was fortunate enough to get in since I applied literally as soon as it opened but from the emails they sent us informing those who applied they asked all of those who would be unable to attend to request refunds no later than March 1st which I would assume would allow those in from the 1st original wait list to move up and apply as seats became available. They said they only had space for 222 students so I'm surprised they even opened up a 2nd wait list, if the 1st one had also reached maximum capacity of however many students they accepted.\n\nI honestly think it would be best for them to just make a 2nd Nuestra Grad ceremony, especially with the number of Latinx students on campus.\n\nI hope you get in \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude4f",

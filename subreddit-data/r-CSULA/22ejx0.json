However they are not available for checking out. \n\nI didn't get to see 'everything' but I was surprised to see some cool stuff.\n\nIf you have free time, definitely worth the time.\n\nWhile I was talking to the person in charge, I found out that the archive hasn't been really taken care of for many years. The new person is working hard to making it more accessible and presentable to the students.\n\nThe room is located in 2nd floor of our library.",

On top of that, in-person classes means that I have to figure out my housing situation ASAP. My partner is a student at CSUN and there\u2019s a petition going around over there to try to get the school to stay online this semester. Any chance anyone reading this knows of a similar petition for CSULA? From reading these comments and judging by some of the reactions from my professors, I feel like a lot of people would rather remain online.",

I\u2019m just wondering if they\u2019ll change their mind yet again and have us go in person for two weeks then bomb back online\u2026are all your professors going back in person now that is was announced? I know some are like 50/50 they\u2019ll do zooms and go every other week.",

So I don't doubt it!\n\nAll of mine are going in person with the exception of a specfic online class I chose. Being a Kinesiology major, with option for teaching, all my professors are hoping to stay in person since we are suppose to be getting familar with the equipment, and trying out lesson plans with possibly new sports we've never done. So I guess my major benefits more from in-person. Although it would be interesting to try and do it online too.",

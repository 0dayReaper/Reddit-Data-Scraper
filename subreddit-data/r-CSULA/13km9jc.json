He is skipping the real one since his family hasn't supported him. I live in Canada and I have no idea what the sash colour is for geology students (I want to order a robe and sash on Amazon that would be as accurate to the real thing as possible). I have no idea how to find out the colours. If no one knows, even having an idea of how I could look it up or who to call. Simple Google searches haven't helped me so far.",

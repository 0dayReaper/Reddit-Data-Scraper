Same format as the actual test but harder.\n\nReading: The Reading section is basically testing your reading comprehension, so if you\u2019re well read, you shouldn\u2019t have too many problems with this section. Otherwise, I\u2019d search up free multiple choice questions on the Internet and practice on them (ex. readtheory.org).\n\nIt was my lowest score at 87% partly because I was rushing by the end, so pay attention to the timer!\n\nMath: Brandon Craft on Youtube\n\nScience: I\u2019m guessing you already took A&amp;P and Organic Chem, so I would just study your notes as they\u2019re much more detailed (I hope) than most Youtube videos. Use Khan Academy and Organic Chemistry Tutor if you need clarifications though. \n\nEnglish: Tests you on grammar and vocabulary, which was fairly easy I\u2019d say. Refer to the practice tests if you want more practice.",

    "postText": "[Follow his page](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2aA8615xM2SAgC5HpI5uiY) for access to the playlists. \n\nEach one is in the 3-4 hour range and they are:\n\n**Instrumental Retrowave**: atmospheric synth music inspired by 80s sci-fi and action movies and TV shows.;\n\n**Ambient Retrowave**: more laidback and chill than the first playlist;\n\n**Strong Synths**: synthwave that\u2019s good not only for coding or studying, but also for exercising, jogging etc;\n\n**Outrunning**: energetic beats to keep us awake during long coding sessions, also great for gaming;\n\nPS: the playlists are in the bottom of the artist page if you use Spotify mobile.",

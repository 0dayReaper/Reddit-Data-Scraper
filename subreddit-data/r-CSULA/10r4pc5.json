The first week we just went over the syllabus and called it a night. This week though, we're supposed to be sorted into teams by the instructor and made to play against other teams from class. We have to submit screenshots of match results that show that we played with who we were supposed to play with every week for class credit. From what I've heard, these classes are super chill. They're just meant as a way for students to relieve stress and collaborate and/or compete amongst one another.",

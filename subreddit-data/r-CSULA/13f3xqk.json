Also, there are no student loans, just the grant which has also never happened. Is anyone in the same situation as me or is just an error from the financial aid office?",

If you were expecting loans, definitely call the FA office because they should be already there. I'm starting a program at another CSU and had to call the FA office to ask about the loans on mine. Had some sort of issue with undergrad vs graduate loan caps so I had to sort those out personally. Definitely worth giving F.A. a call.",

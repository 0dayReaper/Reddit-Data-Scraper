Classes do fill up fast but I had the opportunity to get all my required classes. One advice is to stay away from Jan Wiseman lol. Horrible teacher, she teaches CIS courses.",

I love the idea of Computer Information Systems, and have been enjoying the classes thus far, however the business side of it was something I didn\u2019t think would be so impactful. You will have to take a decent handful of business-only related classes, which I understand but threw me off pretty hard. All-in-all it\u2019s very fun!",

I like the aspect of linking business and technology as those two are my main interests. I\u2019m trying to reach out to students experiences. Hopefully it\u2019ll be great.",

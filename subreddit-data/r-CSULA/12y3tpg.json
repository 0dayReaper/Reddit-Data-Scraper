If it's about your lifetime eligibility, essentially, if it isn't used up fully, it'll just be kept in their funds. If you are taking 4-5 courses, then you should just wait to receive your refund that'll show up through direct deposit if you signed up for it.",

Summer Pell grant is unable to actually pay 100% of the tuition cost. You can also see this info online. There's a summer Pell grant calculator on the website as well that will let you know the exact amount you may need to pay out of pocket. Hope this helps!\n.\n.\n.\n\n\"A:  The maximum Pell Grant that you are eligible for is already posted in GET for summer and reflects full-time enrollment.  If you enroll in less than 12 units, the Pell Grant will be prorated.  For example, students who are eligible for a full-time award of $3,248 and enroll in 6 units will qualify for $1,624.\"\n\nhttps://www.calstatela.edu/financialaid/summer-pell-grant-faq",

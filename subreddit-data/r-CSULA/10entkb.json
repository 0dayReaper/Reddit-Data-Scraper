If so, log into your GET account and click on Student Center, once in there on the left hand side there will be a section that says Academics, under that section there\u2019s a drop down menu that says other academics, click on that and scroll down to Enrollment: Drop and choose that option, it\u2019ll then take you to the drop page where you will click the class you want to drop and then click the next button, which will then take you to a confirmation page asking if that\u2019s the course(s) you want to drop and after you click finalize, it\u2019ll take you to the official confirmation page showing the class(es) have been dropped. After that you can wait 24hrs and then call cashiers to request your refund for over 6.1 units.",

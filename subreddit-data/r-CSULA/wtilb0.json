I feel like it is released around mid-October but I wanted to see if someone knew if there was an actual release date?\n\nAlso, I went to CSUN before and they do it right--the Spring 2023 schedule has been out for a few months there already. That is great that they do that and give students time to plan ahead. I wish CSULA was like that. ",

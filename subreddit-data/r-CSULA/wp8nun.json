Schedule for my commute looks like:\n\nMonday: leave around 12-12:30PM and leave campus around 6PM\n\nTuesday/Thursday: Leave around 8AM and leave campus around 3PM\n\nWednesday: Leave around 8 AM and leave campus around 8 PM\n\nThe times where I leave campus can be a bit later if needed as I don\u2019t mind staying a bit later and study on campus until class ends or traffic dies down. We can talk about how to split gas and such too.",

What do you like and dislike about the program and the department? I\u2019m also interested in doing a thesis so if you have information about research that would be really helpful. Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "To reiterate the other post, get to know your professors early if you would like to do research. Graph theory is a common interest in the \u201cpure\u201d math faculty there, so that might be something to keep in mind. For things more algebraic, Dr. Krebs is a great person to talk to. If you prefer more logic/combinatorial/set theory flavors, then Dr. Mijares is someone you\u2019d like to get to talk to. Just start getting to know your professors and areas they like. \n\nIn terms of coursework, it depends. For some people, they came into this program having already seen most of the topics during undergrad while others haven\u2019t. Regardless, the professors here are all pretty great when it comes to teaching/lecturing. So even if you\u2019ve never seen Lebesgue Integration, Galois theory, or Function Spaces, I do think you\u2019ll be fine if you put in the work. \n\nIf you are planning to pursue a PhD, then taking Real Analysis, Abstract Algebra I and II, Complex Analysis, Topology, Applied Linear Analysis are courses you should become familiar with, since Math PhD programs require qualifying exams in most of those areas. or If that\u2019s not your goal, then perhaps other classes might suit you? But speak to your advisor and you might want to listen to them rather than a stranger on the internet about this. \n\nAs for writing a thesis, it is definitely time consuming. Especially if you want to produce something original. The time it takes to make progress on a problem will always take more time than you think. And then typing up your LaTex is going to take you twice as long as you expect as well. I\u2019d say, definitely start getting better at LaTex as a start. \n\nAs for what I liked about the department, it\u2019s was exactly what I needed at that point in my math life. I had finished a math undergrad and I barely knew what was going on. But because it is more geared toward teaching (and I also buckled down) this was the right choice for me. The way that the professors approach teaching a class helped me. I saw so many more examples worked out than before and more pictures/diagrams than ever before and it just made everything click. The one dislike I do have would have to be the difficulty. I had an ego problem, and I thought I was too good for this program. I did breeze through all the courses and material (I\u2019d do their comp exams for fun). So that just made it worse for my perception. But still, I might have been an exception, since some people from my time there did have trouble with understanding the material. I think I might have had the lucky stroke of seeing this material before and having it kick me down many times before coming to Cal State, so I could understand everything even more the second/third time around.",

So yes, officials transcripts will need to be submitted even if you're not done with the spring semester. It's conditional because in the email, they mentioned that they know that I haven't finished my prerequisites for my major based on what I entered on my application and that that they will need to be done by the end of Spring. So if you received an offer of conditional admission for the fall, you have to make sure you pass your Spring classes. I'm sure they will ask for those grades closer to Fall enrollment.",

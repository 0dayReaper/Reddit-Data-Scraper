I am getting more than enough to cover tuition in grants but when I check my student center it shows my account summary saying I owe \"3,400\" for a future date? Does anyone know why",

            "comment": "the $3,400 should be paid in a few days/around the time school starts. since you said your grants are more than enough to cover tuition, the $3,400 should just be taken from that &amp; the excess should be refunded to you either through a check in the mail or direct deposit if you connected your bank account. it\u2019ll show up as if you made a payment whenever they do take it out of your grants.\n[previous post similar to yours](https://www.reddit.com/r/CSULA/comments/i97uhn/get/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",

Since you're receiving finaid/grants, this will be covered by those and the system recognizes it as it allowed you to enroll in classes without paying that amount out of pocket. Your grants will cover tuition and fees first, and if anything is left over you'll get a check to use for other school related expenses.",

    "postText": "I have 2 later classes. The first is 4:30 to 5:45 and the second is 6:00-7:15. The one that starts at 6:00 just got moved to zoom instead of in person while my 4:30 class remains in person. It's not possible for me to drive home before my zoom class starts. I've never really been around this campus and don't know it that well. Anyone know where I could go on campus to attend my zoom class without interruptions?",

There are also desk areas in the library along the walls that give you some privacy to take classes if the rooms aren\u2019t available.",

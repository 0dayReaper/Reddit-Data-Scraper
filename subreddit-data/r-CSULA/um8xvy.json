    "postText": "Hi all\nI\u2019m considering transferring here next spring. A big factor in deciding whether or not to transfer to CSULA is the distance I would have to travel to attend. From other posts I\u2019ve read, many students commute. However, I was curious-what are the options like for online courses? Would I be able to do my third year (or perhaps half of it), online only? I\u2019m quite an unknowledgeable first gen, so I don\u2019t know how uni varies from CC\u2019s. Anyone have experience with this? Thanks!",

            "comment": "For reasons that not clear to anyone, Cal State LA's administrators are pushing for more face-to-face courses. A lot of online courses were still offered in spring 2022, but the only online Psy courses offered in fall 2022 are PSY 3030, 3220, 3230, 3250, and 4500. Many lecturers and students want more online courses, so I don't know what will happen in future.\n\nBut may be you can search online courses here and take some psy courses from other CSUs here: [https://www.calstate.edu/attend/degrees-certificates-credentials/Pages/online.aspx](https://www.calstate.edu/attend/degrees-certificates-credentials/Pages/online.aspx)",

I don\u2019t know too much about it myself but on our student portal system it seemed to be something where you can take online classes from other colleges within the CSU system.",

I have compiled a short list of points of interest in Los Angeles that are close to campus and relatively inexpensive. This is not a comprehensive list, just a few of my favorites and a way for you to get started exploring the beautiful City of The  Angels!  (See info with links in the comments.)",

If you take your car, you\u2019ll have to pay for parking.  There are several lots around Olvera Street, costing about $10-$15 for the day.  (I\u2019m not sure if there is street parking with meters a little further away - I usually suck it up and pay for the lot even though it\u2019s a little pricey.)\n\n[Union Station](https://www.unionstationla.com/) itself is a landmark.  Walk around to appreciate its architecture and history.  Union Station has appeared in many movies and television shows throughout the decades since it was built!\n\n[Olvera Street](https://discoverolverastreet.com/) is a must-see.  Cute shops/stalls &amp; excellent food!  Go to the end of the street to try their famous taquitos.  In the middle of the street, go down the corridor for some stuffed churros.  Yes, you heard me - delicious churros stuffed with cream, chocolate, caramel, strawberry\u2026yum!\n\n[Chinatown](https://www.discoverlosangeles.com/things-to-do/the-guide-to-chinatown-in-los-angeles) is really fun to walk around, shop, and eat.  It\u2019s right beyond Olvera Street.\n\nThe [Chinese American Museum](https://camla.org/) is free and right near Olvera Street.  Small, but super cute and informative with many artifacts.\n\n[La Plaza de Cultura y Artes](https://lapca.org/)is also complimentary with much information about the contributions of Mexicans and Latinos to California\u2019s history.\n\nAre you ready for the best sandwich in Los Angeles?  Then head on over to the famous [Phillipe The Original](https://www.philippes.com/) and get yourself a French dip.  You won\u2019t be sorry!\n\nI hope you have the opportunity to explore the city and enjoy what Los Angeles has to offer.  Happy adventures!",

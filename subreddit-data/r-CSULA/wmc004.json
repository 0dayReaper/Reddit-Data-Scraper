            "comment": "Financial Aid will automatically first pay tuition on the 12th. Any money you have left over will then carry over to pay for housing, if you have any money left after that then it will either be disbursed to your bank account or through a check.\n\nEdit to add: Depending on how much financial aid you've been given for the semester, sometimes after tuition is paid you won't have enough to cover all of your housing payment, so just keep in mind that you might have to pay out of pocket for some of it.",

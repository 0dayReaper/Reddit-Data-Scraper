As when I look at the date for set up it says  \n\n**There are currently no available sessions at this time.**\n\nI don't know what to do and I'm scared that if I don't finish this sign up by may 31 I won't be able to go to Cal State La",

Was this for all the dates for your major?\n\n\n\nAlso I dont know if this helps but this is from the website.\n\nhttps://www.calstatela.edu/students-families/faq \n\n\"The Priority Sign-Up date for Orientation this spring is Tuesday, May 31, 2022. Please try to complete your reservation by this time to ensure that you do not miss out on any important communications. However, if you are not able to complete your reservation by this time, you will continue to have access to the reservation system and can complete the reservation process when you are able to do so.\"\n\nSo I'm assuming that it may be okay but if you need someone to talk to on campus I can try and help you get that sorted out :O",

            "comment": "I signed up for virtual orientation nearly two months ago. When I signed up, the site showed several options for in-person orientation and one for a virtual orientation. \n\nFrom my understanding they *want* you to sign up by May 31st, but you will still be able to register for your orientation after that date - if need be. \n\nThis [FAQ](https://www.calstatela.edu/students-families/faq) page will give you more information. \n\nThey also list this email to contact with questions: orientation@calstatela.edu\n\nGood luck!",

I suggest contacting the office directly tomorrow just to confirm since they're closed today due to the holiday. Here's a link to all their contact info: https://www.calstatela.edu/students-families/contact-us",

    "postText": "Transfer student here. Orientation for the nursing program is a day away, and I was planning to \u201ctour\u201d the school an hour beforehand. I\u2019ve read from other posts that I have to use PayByPhone to pay for parking since I\u2019m not fully enrolled yet.  If I stay for over 8 hours, do I have to pay extra bucks? And for these daily permits, can I park anywhere as long as I entered the right parking struct. number or am i only allowed to park in certain levels? If it\u2019s the latter, what  are those levels?\n\nOrientation will be happening at Salazar Hall. I\u2019ve heard about the sinkhole situation in Parking Structure B. Would Parking A provide a safer parking?",

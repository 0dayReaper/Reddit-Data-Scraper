I'm a second year majoring in Computer Information Systems, and next year I need to choose either the Information Systems path or the Information Technology path. \n\nFor someone who took the information systems path, how were the required option IS courses? Were they more technical (like using software and creating systems)? More towards business? Both?\n\nAlso, which path do you think would be better?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this!!!",

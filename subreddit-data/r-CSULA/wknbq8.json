    "postText": "I am applying for CSULA for the Spring semester and read the website that they want Spring transfers to finish the AS-T by the Summer 2022. I will be done with my AS-T at the end of Fall 2022. Is there no chance of admission? Or is my chance lower than most applicants?\n\nAlso they stated that 60 units by the summer and I am at 59 but will finish the Fall with 72.5 units. This was my top choice for university and I am not sure if it automatically disqualifies me.",

I would suggest not wasting your time/money on applying if you don\u2019t meet the admission requirements. I think they don\u2019t want to give anyone special treatment or have it perceived that way.\n\nEdit: The AD-T is its own thing. The school has specific rules/deadlines on when that degree must be awarded before admittance to CSU can be granted.",

Don\u2019t worry about the classes you haven\u2019t finish, just make sure those classes say in progress on your transcript. I don\u2019t think it should affect your chances, but they may offer you conditional acceptance. On the condition that you finish those classes. Good luck!",

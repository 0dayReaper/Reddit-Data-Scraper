Do you go into industries and shadow/intern for them? I'm confused.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this!",

            "comment": "I took CIS 4900.\n\nThe course involves weekly quizzes, a group project, and a certification exam:\n\n**Weekly Quizzes**\n\nWeekly quizzes are based on material from previous courses that you should be familiar with by the time you take CIS 4900. These quizzes are designed to refresh your understanding of core CIS concepts (networking, security, systems analysis, etc.) so that you'll be prepared for the certification exam. I believe the quizzes are worth something like 10-20% of your grade, and Dr. Howell provides study material for each quiz.\n\n**Certification Exam**\n\nThe ICCP ISA certification exam serves as your final exam. The certification itself doesn't really hold any real value in the professional world as far as I know, but it is a measure of your readiness as an aspiring IS professional. You need a 50% on the exam to pass the exam, which gives you 100% on your final exam grade. If you don't pass, your final exam score scales down with the score you get; 45% on the exam gives you a 90% on your final exam grade, 40% gives you an 80%, etc.\n\n**Group Project**\n\nFor the group project, you'll select a business case and preferred IS role/discipline (data analyst, system analyst, security analyst, etc.) and you'll be assigned to a group that chose similar roles/cases. Each group is assigned a unique set of deliverables associated with the role they chose. For example, a Systems Analyst group will gather requirements, write use cases, design activity diagrams, etc. You'll collaborate in your group using Teams or Slack to work on deliverables which are typically due at each 1-2 week \"Milestone\". You'll have up to 8 Milestones total for the entire project. You'll also have a group presentation where you'll have to dress in professional attire and present your project like you're making a pitch to the business you chose. This project is worth 50% of your grade.\n\nAs someone else mentioned, the pass rate for this class is high, but that doesn't mean that you get to slack off. There are incredibly detailed rubrics for every deliverable you turn in, and grades are assigned to the whole group. This means that if one person on your group doesn't produce work that satisfies all the requirements in rubric (or doesn't do the work at all, which happens), everyone in your group will suffer point deductions. This also means that if you want an A for this course, you're going to HATE group members who are happy with a C, because their laziness/stupidity/selfishness will force you to do most of the work.\n\n**What this course is really about**\n\nSomeone mentioned RateMyProfessor. Based on the ratings I've seen for Dr. Howell and other professors at CSULA, I would take RMP with a MASSIVE grain of salt. \n\nTake this bullshit for example:\n\n&gt;My major problem for this professor is that she provided a 30 minute video to how to take the final exam. She doesn't teach a whole lot that is relevant to the course btw.\n\nFirst, the idea that Dr. Howell \"doesn't teach a whole lot that is relevant to the course\" is absurd. Weekly quizzes are meant for you to review concepts you should already be familiar with. Most people forget stuff, so Dr. Howell provides an extensive collection of study material and lectures on the concepts before each quiz. She also explains that these quizzes are for you to prepare for the ICCP exam, and she gives a practice module before the exam so you know what the exam is going to be like. Essentially, Dr. Howell gives you every possible advantage to succeed. \n\nSecond, and more importantly: This person obviously failed to grasp the point of the course. Capstone is not your typical college course where an instructor is supposed to \"teach\" you something. This course is designed to test your understanding of everything you should've already learned from your 2+ years in the program, with emphasis on the disciplines that you want to pursue in your professional career. Your project is based on IS disciplines that YOU choose, meaning that you have some control over what you're going to do in this course. It's more likely that this person coasted through the program without learning anything, and was overdependent on others for guidance. This is also the kind of person that makes group projects an absolute nightmare, because their work typically requires lots of revisions (if it even gets done at all).\n\nThis turned out pretty long, but I hope it answers your question.",

            "comment": "I have never taken it personally. But the course is taught by Dr. Pamella Howell in Fall 2022. You can see what her course structure for CIS 4900 is like here: [https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2614632](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2614632)\n\nIt looks like you will do a group project, weekly quizzes, and also take some kind of a certification exam as a final exam. I can tell you that the course has a very low failure rate (1%). If you take the course, you will most likely pass.",

    "postText": "I know I have made a few posts on here asking but I have literally found no information online on if people have been accepted to the CSULA/UCLA Joint Special Ed Doctoral Program. Has anyone been admitted or know of someone who has? The only application for it is on CSU Apply for CSULA as the first year takes place at CSULA. I am waiting on pins and needles to know my status. Apparently I saw the email where CSULA requested my official transcripts a few weeks late by accident and had my application \u201cofficially\u201d forwarded to the SPED department on 2/8 once they received my official transcripts from me. I turned in my app back in November 2021 though. It\u2019s frustrating to wait this long but I just wish I had some insight. \ud83d\ude0a",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI am conducting research for a psychology class I'm taking at Mt. San Antonio College. I'm looking for participants between the ages of 18 and 64, US residents, who have either been diagnosed with a mental health condition or believe you have a mental health condition. I'm interested in students in the greater Southern California area. If you are interested in participating click this [link](https://mtsac.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4NLfJPKIKRC8veS) to take part. It would really help me out and the results of this study will contribute to the understanding of barriers to accessing mental health treatment.",

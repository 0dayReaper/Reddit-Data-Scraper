    "postText": "So I'm an incoming journalism transfer student from Los Angeles Pierce College and over the past month or so, I've applied for the bachelor's program in journalism at both CSUN and CSULA. I live in Van Nuys, so CSUN is about 7.2 miles while CSULA is about 21.1 miles from my home. So if we were talking distance-wise, then CSUN is the best option. But CSULA is technically the only Cal State to have Sports Broadcasting, which is a class that I have been longing to take as I love sports and I feel I'd do well in sports broadcasting. I also have been reading up on how bad CSULA's reputation is and that CSUN is better in terms of the environment. \n\nIf it helps, I don't drive, and I'm usually a bit reclusive but I am open to making friends. I have yet to be notified on whether I got accepted to both or not though my chances of getting accepted are pretty high, as I will complete my major and my GE requirements by next spring. Any advice?",

As for the no driving part, they offer semester long metrolink pass with a discount, I believe. Look into that. I also live in van nuys. It\u2019s only 2 years. You can definitely do it!",

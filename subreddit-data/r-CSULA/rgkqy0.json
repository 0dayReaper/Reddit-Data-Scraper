I can see that for my classes I am registered for my Professors have already started on the course canvas page. \n\nDoes anyone have any information about this? Or, is it most likely a waiting game? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you! :)",

The classes I want that would fit my schedule are filled with a lengthy wait-list. I would be able to make it for in-person classes if parking was decent. \n\nAlso, I feel like it is anxiety because I have never stepped foot on a college campus. I am just really worried about parking, other students, and attending class in-person.",

    "postText": "That was a shitty semester for me. I had projects that had due dates on the last day of finals ... for those of you who have only been to CSULA or SMC or ELACC or whatever, that's not normal. I had a quiz due the same day as a final in the same class. The last few weeks just felt like a giant academia shit show at CSULA. \n\nThey had 4 different days to choose from to schedule my finals and shoved three of them on one day  with no time apart\n\nI received my project grades *after* finals (?!?) Like how am I supposed to know what I did wrong and how to correct it *after* the class has ended. I can't learn from a project that I get zero feedback on so I have no idea what I did wrong and what I should do to fix it. You can't do that once the damn class is finished. \n\nUgh. I have more but those are the worst offenders. \n\nAnyway thanks to the CSULA student fam that always has each other's backs. Happy Holidays, stay safe.",

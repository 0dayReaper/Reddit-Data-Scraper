    "postText": "I am starting my masters in materials science engineering this fall. So I\u2019m scheduled to register for classes on July 5, but was looking through the options for classes to see what I\u2019d like. There\u2019s nothing there except thesis classes though? Is this normal, will there actually be real classes offered? \n\nAlso I was told I\u2019d get notified about orientation and all that fun stuff but I\u2019ve got nothing in my personal or cal state email. \n\nAny advice or experience would be helpful!",

            "comment": "I checked right now and there's only one class which is MSE 4142 Chemistry and physics of materials which I think is the first class you take \n\nI'm still an undergrad student but if it's the same orientation stuff, then you could go to the cal state website and check orientation dates or even talk to a counselor. \n\nUsually though they put more or take out classes depending on how many people are applying I think for now they only have the first class because all MSE students have to take that class and later on they'll add more. \n\nYou could also check the GET and browse the classes offered under MSE on the catalog browser. It shows you all the MSE classes offered by cal state la and when they're offered. \n\nAlso side note I think towards the end of your degree depending if you chose to do research or comprehensive exam they let you take graduate or upper level electives from chemistry, physics, and mechanical engineering. Some of the electives are geared towards material science, electromagnetic properties, Biomaterials, and quantum mechanics if you're into that.",

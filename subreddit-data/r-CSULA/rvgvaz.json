            "comment": "As a freshman this year, but from California, I can first start by saying the school has really not lived up to the expectations I had of it before attending. I know the academics here are good, but if you're thinking just academics, CSUF is a great school as well. Social life wise, I have felt that the school is no where near inclusive or eventful, and most students here are commuters so they just want to get in and get out (meaning I've found my experience here to be very lonely and quiet, especially because I am not local to LA). Fullerton is still very much a part of SoCal and still a lot you can do, but one thing I can also mention is that LA is EXPENSIVE (especially if you're thinking long-term). So with that keep those things in mind!",

Everyone here is pretty cool, no ones a rich asshole and most people worked to get to where they are. There are also lots of creatives and I\u2019ve made great connections and networks through people. Also the fact that\u2019s it\u2019s a small school is better sometimes, we have brand new dorms, dining hall never gets too crowded, security is lacking (I consider this a plus, especially when it comes to bringing people into dorms)",

If you\u2019re talking like social life, activities, city surroundings, I recommend looking it up on here or asking around and see any stories people share of their experiences.

Just a heads up that CSULA is actually on the Far East side of LA, closer to Alhambra and Monterey park than Hollywood or Santa Monica. Alhambra and Monterey park are part of the San Gabriel valley so plenty of good Asian food and safe, affordable places to live. \n\nI\u2019ve heard CSULA has a good engineering school as well but don\u2019t know much about it. If you have a good portfolio and a degree from CSULA I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do well after college. \n\nCSUF is nice too. Fullerton is a great town and everyone I know that went there had a good time. There\u2019s probably more socially going on at Fullerton than Cal State LA.",

Do those 2 years and get a part time job and pile up cash so you can transfer over here (if your still interested) and not end up into more debt than if you went straight over here from high school.",

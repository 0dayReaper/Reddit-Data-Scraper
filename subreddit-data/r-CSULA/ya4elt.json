    "postText": "Ballots went out this week for the first ever direct election of the national leadership of the UAW.  This election takes place because almost the entire leadership has found itself in jail over the course of the last few years for accepting bribes in exchange for returning sweetheart deals to management.  Contracts that workers are still toiling under, (even if, as with California grad students, they have expired).  Will Lehman, a second tier Mack Trucks worker from Macungie PA, is running in order to return the union and it's assets back to the rank and file.  He will be holding a zoom meeting on Sunday to discuss the way forward, I would urge every grad student to register and watch, which you can do here:  [https://www.willforuawpresident.org/](https://www.willforuawpresident.org/).  You can also view the debate between all of the candidates there as well as volunteer to help with Will's campaign, which is a campaign for all of you.\n\nGrad students are working under horrendous condtions and worse pay, and they deserve and demand better:  [https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/10/12/pffh-o12.html](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/10/12/pffh-o12.html)",

    "postText": "Hey everyone I am a trans guy who is gonna be going to csula in the spring and I just wanna know how I can make sure my birth name isn\u2019t seen by any teachers? I have gotten emails with my birth name and even calls. I don\u2019t want anyone to know that name so what do I do? Is it just not an option for me to have that name not be visible? I don\u2019t want it to be said to me at orientation or have it on my student ID card. What do I do to prevent all that from happening? It\u2019s just been very nerve wracking because it\u2019s a name I am just can\u2019t use anymore at school so I want college to be a fresh start for me. If I have more questions would any of you be open to answering them like can I dm you when I think of more ?",

DM me if you have any questions about my experience. Hope this helps!\n\n\n\nLink for more info: https://www.calstatela.edu/registrar/preferred-first-name-pronouns\n\n\n\"Use the Request Preferred First Name Change feature in GET to formally request a Preferred First Name be used by the University.\n\nIf approved, your Preferred First Name will be used:\n\nIn the university directory\n\nIn campus communications\n\nIn the MyCalStateLA Student Center\n\nIn Canvas as your Display Name\n\nOn class rosters\n\nOn your\u00a0Golden Eagle One Card\n\nIn reporting\n\n\nNote there are circumstances where the use of the legal name is required. For example, some records, such as paychecks, legal documents, and transcripts require use of a legal name; in such circumstances, the university is not able to use Preferred First Name.\n\nAn approved Preferred First Name may be used on a diploma and in the Commencement program if requested by you on a\u00a0graduation application, otherwise your primary (legal) name shall be used.\"",

That's what I had to do!\n\nFor the school ID, I told them my preferred name and thankfully they changed it to that so hopefully they'll be understanding if you get the ID before the name change!",

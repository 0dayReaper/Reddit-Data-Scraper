Once you download \u201cPayByPhone\u201d it will locate your location using your phone and ask you how many hours or minutes you want to pay for. I think 4 hours is 4 dollars and 8 hours is 8 dollars. But one you download the app it will make sense. I believe they also ask you for your vehicle info.",

Don\u2019t pay for days you didnt see the parking station though. If you got away with it, you got away with it \ud83d\ude0e do you know how to check if you have parking tickets?",

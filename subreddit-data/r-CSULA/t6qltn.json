    "postText": "UPDATE: \nThey made it seemed like we had a choice but we actually did not. Some students had met with President Conoley several time to find negotiation. Last month she gave us hope and showed that she was willing to make #letcsulbwalk happen. This week, it is \"NO NEGOTIATION\" from her end.\n\nhttps://daily49er.com/news/2022/03/07/commencement-decision-made-before-release-of-survey-results/\n\nThank you anyone who support us on this. We failed but I'm glad we fought. \n\nHi my fellow CSU students,\nI am not sure where this is going to go but I just want to see how much support we have on this. SOOOOOOOOO CSULB decides to not let us walk for the graduation commencement using the COVID excuses earlier this year and now when everything is going back to normal, they hit us with BUDGET and STAFFING problems. I have attached the petition for those of you who want to see our argument on having the traditional commencement. YES, some of you might see walking is not such a big deal. At first, I'm fighting to be able to walk... but now, I'm fighting because the school is acting like a dictator on this issue. They did let us vote by sending an email to the \"qualified\" students. HOWEVER, we found out later that about half of the graduating seniors did not actually receive that email and some even have issue with the website preventing them to vote!!!! Despite the majority of the submitted votes (52%) was for traditional commencement, in the email that President Conoley sent out, they tried to make it sound like it's entirely our fault that they did not receive as much votes and since there were only 33% of the qualified students voted (let me remind you that the majority outcome was 52% towards traditional commencement). By that, they decided to throw a big \"SCREW YOU\" at us by announcing they will stick to their old plan. FURTHERMORE, when students put efforts to write long a$$ emails to the committee or the school president expressing their situation and how importance this is to them and their life, we all get that ONE copy_paste reply email!!! SOOOO What's more? you may ask. THE BIGGEST, MOST RECENT F_U we just got is where they told us there'd be a person from Commencement committee to attend the ASI meeting (in those, the students can make public comments and raise awareness on certain issues), and they CANCELED just right before the meeting started so there was no person from the committee there to hear us as promised. \n\nP/s: Oh, and they keep throwing out \"budget\" problem but we haven't actually see the actual numbers that they are spending on traditional vs new. They told us reading our names will cost them about a couple hundreds k more!! The students are trying to request them to publish the previous years cost for traditional commencement but they have not done anything about it.\n\nTL;DR: CSULB has been a big D to the students and now we want to do something about it starting with the fight for traditional commencement.\n\n[Petition](https://www.change.org/p/jane-close-conoley-csulb-2022-graduation-petition)\n\nAn article from lbpost on this matter:\nhttps://lbpost.com/news/education/csulb-commencement-wont-change-cost-graduation?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook#Echobox=1645975184",

You probably took out debt for 4-5 years of education there, they can pay a few hundred grand for a graduation ceremony - ESPECIALLY if they forced you guys back to class in person this semester. \n\n\nAnd,, it\u2019s already March - this is time sensitive asf lol, they need to agree to do it in person in the next &lt;2 weeks in order to have time to plan it. \n\nForce an ASI emergency meeting, or gather a group of 5-20 students to start physically going into administrators offices and having this conversation. \n\nStudents have power, but we need to be organized and aggressive.",

    "postText": "Hello CSULA Redditors,\n\nECST is looking to hire entry-level Student Assistants for their ITC team. I don't have the job duties immediately on hand, but they are looking for computer savvy undergraduate or graduate students who can help install software, maintain and troubleshoot the college computers, and other miscellaneous computer related duties. So this might be a good fit for CS or CIS majors, but it's not required.\n\nTo see the official duties and responsibilities and to apply, please visit the Career Center Handshake website: [https://www.calstatela.edu/careercenter/cal-state-la-handshake](https://www.calstatela.edu/careercenter/cal-state-la-handshake)\n\nEDIT: It turns out the Career Center listed the Work Study and Non-work Study positions under two different Job listing\n\nThe Work Study job ID is  #6644277.\n\nThe Non-Work Study Job ID is  #6642373.\n\nIf you do not know if you qualify for Work Study, please apply for #6642373. If you know you qualify for Work-Study, apply for #6644277. All the applications and resumes come to us basically the same, and all applicants are evaluated the same regardless if they are applying for one or the other. I think this is just how the career center system organizes things.\n\nIf you guys have any questions, I'll try to answer them.",

You just need to be an official student (in good standing).\n\nIf accepted, you are basically working as long as you are taking classes (full time units) at CalStateLA.\n\nEdit: sorry for all the stealth edits, I keep remembering more stuff as I type.",

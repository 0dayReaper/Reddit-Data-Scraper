    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nSo I failed a class in Spring 2022 semester. It was a 2000 level class and I retook it this semester at community college. How do I transfer my grade over to CSULA? Do I just send them electronically to the admissions office or do I have to do some sort of academic renewal petition? Thanks.",

What are you planning on majoring in?\n\nI think that if you went ahead and submitted new transcripts with your updated form that would be sufficient. Also, if you can do academic renewal at your school to get the class scrubbed from your record that would be good too. That process can take a while sometimes though so think about it first because you\u2019ll want to do the renewal before submitting the updated transcript. good luck!!",

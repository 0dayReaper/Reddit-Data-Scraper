My biggest values are a college where people are nice, there's good student life, a lot of people living in the dorms, good classes, and a good study abroad program!",

This place has good connections, good people, social connections and events for jobs and etc. \n\nCons: I guess if you\u2019re like into partying want that stereotypical talking with the partying everyday not the place for it. Sorry. School is very work orientated. You want to be involved ? It\u2019s more up to you to go to clubs and go to social events. Etc. But in reality fucking around doesn\u2019t guarantee you a good job in life so up to you.",

You have to be willing to put yourself out there.\n\nSocial life is there, but it's mainly because clubs from CSULA  hang out with clubs from CSUN and Long Beach and USC and UCLA.\n\nIt's a really fast paced environment because you have a lot of people who simultaneously work and go to school and commute and help out their families.\n\nAll in all, you'll never run out of things to do once you make a few friends.",

    "postText": "I got my acceptance all the way back in January but boyfriend has no received anything at all. We are super confused. No word on acceptance or not. We are both transfer students from Pasadena City College. He has an AA-T and a solid GPA. His only issue is his past of flip-flopping between colleges and majors (He was Computer Science major at UC Santa Barbara and then dropped out cuz he hated it, went to Glendale Community College with a different major, and then was consistent the last 3 years at Pasadena City College with a completed AA-T) but he got great grades while he was at those colleges and was in good standing despite being indecisive about his major. And even if he showed inconsistency he completed an AA-T and great grades at PCC. So why should his academic past effect his acceptance? Is it just a space issue if he isn't admitted and should he just try again? I thought a 3.4-3.7 range GPA, an AA-T, and enough credits was enough to get in? For reference I am an art student and he is going into studying accounting. He is 30 and I am 22. I also have an AA-T and my GPA was a 3.5.",

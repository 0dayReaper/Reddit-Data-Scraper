I haven\u2019t gotten offered an interview yet but my app wasn\u2019t given to the grad dept until 2/6 due to Cal State LA delaying it due to my official transcripts.",

At least that\u2019s what the informational session told me. The interview was sent through email and not through the portal too. Hope you hear back soon too! It\u2019s such an anxious waiting period!",

(maybe in the art department?)\n\n\nWhere is the best place to get cheap text books? Are there exchanges?\n\n\nAre there any secret hot tubs or swimming pools we have access to?\n\n\nWhat is the best way to meet people?\n\n\nAre there any school wide parties or events that are amazing?\n\n\nWhats the biggest trap to watch out for?\n",

Last time I saw it was a few years ago though so idk if it\u2019s changed. They had billiards and a PlayStation you can play on. I don\u2019t think cell service works well down there though. \n\nYou can get free scantrons and the blue books from the student union. \n\nI don\u2019t go to Starbucks but they had a camera online you can check to see how long the line is. Idk if they have that anymore so you would have to ask them. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re driving to school you can park right in front of the high school of parking lot 5. A lot of people weren\u2019t sure about parking there so I would easily get that sweet close parking during crowded times. ",

Both lots can still get full by 11AM.\n\nFor swimming, I think there are certain off-hours where you can go and swim in the pool that's behind the basketball gym.\n\nThis is all speaking from experience being a former student 1 year ago.\n\nGood luck :)",

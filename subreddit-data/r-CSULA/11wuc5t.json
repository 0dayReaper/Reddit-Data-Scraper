I had an issue with mine where I qualify for (at least) the Fall 2022 Semester, but they didn't authorize it for some reason. \n\nIf it doesn't say on the CSAC page that you are supposed to receive the MCS, most likely your financial aid already covers what they deem is qualified. The MCS would be better going to another student who potentially doesn't have as much coverage from other financial aid.",

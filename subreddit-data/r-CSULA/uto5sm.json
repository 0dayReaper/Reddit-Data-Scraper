    "postText": "I understand that you have a job to do. I understand that the job sucks.\n\nThat being said, if you are one of the people roaming the campus with clipboards trying to get me to sign something, you need to chill the fuck out. There are too many of you running around hounding students for signatures. I also see that some of you are getting more aggressive with it, so consider this a FAQs for all of you:\n\n**\"Are you registered to vote?\"**\n\nYes, I am registered to vote, but you will never know it, because I will lie to each and every one of you to get you out of my face. It's much easier than telling you \"No\" 5 times, which is usually what it takes.\n\n**\"I'm petitioning to [insert cause here] and I can really use your help!\"**\n\nOn the off-chance that you're able to string together enough words to make an intelligible pitch that doesn't sound like you're trying to sell me a car, I'm still not going to sign, because your entire strategy of soliciting students while they're eating/studying/relaxing is intrusive, aggressive, and borderline harassment. If your employer didn't set up a spot for you to chill and gather signatures from people who were interested enough to ask, go back to your employers and tell them to stop being cheap. And if they told you that it was okay to circle the eating areas like vultures, you're welcome to post the name of the organization that sent you, their contact info, and their lunch hours so I can spam them with that same bullshit.\n\n**\"Come on! It'll only take a minute!\"**\n\nFirst of all, it never takes a minute. I know this because as soon I agree to sign something, you're going to pull five more clipboards out of your ass for me to look at. Second, if the conversation ever gets to the point where a simple \"No\" isn't enough to get you to leave me alone, you've crossed a line. This post is already way too long for me to get into all the aggressive, inappropriate shit that some of you do to coerce people into signing your stuff, so I'll keep it simple: If I say no, it fucking means no. Walk. Away.\n\n**\"It's for a good cause!\"**\n\nIf I started a petition to ban all you fuckers from setting foot on campus, I could probably get more signatures in one week than all of you could get over an entire semester. Even if we pretend that it's more than just a job to you, harassment isn't supposed to be part of your agenda. In fact, it makes your agenda look weak. Go back to your people and find a better way.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\n* **If we say we don't want to sign your stuff, please leave us the fuck alone.** We put up with having to say it once. We shouldn't have to say it more than once.\n* **If we give you attitude, please leave us the fuck alone.** You're likely not the first person to approach us that day. Don't take it personally.\n* **If we look busy, please leave us the fuck alone.** Many of us are here to escape poverty. Your cause is the least of our concerns.\n\nThank you.",

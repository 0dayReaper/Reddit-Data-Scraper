Also I would appreciate if I you could also explain how to read the class names. I understand KH is king hall but I don't know what the rest means. Thanks",

There are signs that help point to the wings. LH I think stands for lecture hall which are on the ground floor (they\u2019re big rooms). You enter from the KH courtyard (by the microwaves). SH stands for Salazar hall.",

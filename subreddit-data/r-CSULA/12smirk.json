Sometimes one of the professors would walk us to our cars with his baseball bat to make sure we made it ok.   \n\n\nWe all used to sometimes walk together in groups to one persons car and then that person would drop everyone off to the various parking lots.   \n\n\nIDK if that campus is that dangerous but it does feel scary sometimes.",

    "postText": "I can't decide if I should have my family make the drive out just to see me graduate from a crappy school in a crappy parking lot.\n\nThey all want me to since they think it's a big deal but I'm probably going to pursue a master's and anywhere else would be an upgrade as far as the commencement goes.\n\nI am not proud of my degree, I hate my department/my professors and they all hate me too. I would only be attending graduation for my parents and probably a little bit for FOMO. Otherwise it sounds like a huge drag.\n\nSo to the alumni, did you attend grad and whatever choice you made, would you do it again if you went back in time?\n\nThanks",

That's also why my parents want me to do the commencement, because they know how hard it's been for me to get this degree and finally finish school despite the disability.",

If you do decide to go, you can buy a cheap cap and gown on Amazon and just buy the sash online from the student store and have it shipped to you.",

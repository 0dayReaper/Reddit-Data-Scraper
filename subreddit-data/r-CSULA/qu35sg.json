    "postText": "Hi!!! I am an incoming spring 22 transfer and I was wondering if it\u2019s worth it to rent an apartment further away (bc it\u2019s cheaper) and commute?? I don\u2019t know how my schedule will look like yet because my registration date is November 29.. but an advisor told me I won\u2019t be able to schedule classes until after December 5th or something? Kind of confused\u2026",

It might possibly be way worst, and you might have to consider which parking structure is best to go to or how much you would need to walk to even get to class.",

From what google shows, even leaving around 6am will still be between 30 to an hour. Hopefully you chill with driving, but if you aint, maybe an apartment might be your best bet.\n\nI commute everyday but Im lucky that I live closer, bout 15 minutes. But with traffic for me it can be anywhere from 30 minutes all the way til an hour.\n\nEdited: 10am traffic seems to clear up but your still looking at around 30 to 50 minutes.",

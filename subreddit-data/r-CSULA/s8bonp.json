    "postText": "So CSULA is one of the universities that I applied for as a Business Computer Information Systems major and  I should be transferring out in the fall from a city college. I've taken all of my Economics and Accounting classes long ago and don't quite remember everything I've learned from those classes. Will the upper division classes at CSULA require me to know Economics and Accounting for Computer Information Systems?",

            "comment": "No. But there is at least one upper division class (ECON 3060) related to economics. However, the class itself is more or less a statistics class with some economic terms thrown around if I remember correctly. As for Accounting, no. There is no upper div class that requires Accounting knowledge.\n\nJust make sure you\u2019ve fulfilled all lower division classes for CIS, and you should be good to go. If you\u2019re unsure, talk to your advisor about it.\n\nGood luck! \n\nReference: https://www.calstatela.edu/sites/default/files/groups/CBE%20Undergraduate%20Advisement/WorksheetPDF/2019_sem_bscis_information_technology.pdf",

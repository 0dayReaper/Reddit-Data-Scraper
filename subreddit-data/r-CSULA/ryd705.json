    "postText": "Good morning CSU LA\n\nSo since the start in-person classes has been pushed back by a few weeks, how has that impacted other campus amenities, ie library, dining , gym, etc.\n\nAre they still open or closed?\n\nI\u2019m asking on behalf of myself (csuf alumni that use the library and gym) and other csuf students.\n\nAny information would be greatly appreciated.\n\nFor context currently csuf has closed its amenities for inter-session and have not made an announcement for spring if the will postpone in-class or not and if they do postpone I wonder if they will postpone opening other stuff to.\n\nThanks \n\n(X-posted to other csu subreddits)\n\nEdit: nvm this post it was just announced what they plan on doing.",

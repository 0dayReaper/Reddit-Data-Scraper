    "postText": "I emailed a professor a couple days ago asking about being added to their class because I'm waitlisted (1st position), but I noticed they had two emails. The second email address was the same as the first but with a 2 at the end. I ended up emailing the address without the 2 but I'm worried that I might've emailed the wrong one. If someone could tell me what the difference between these two emails are that'd be very helpful.",

The campus isn't the prettiest, but the speech clinic is a wonderful resource and makes it easy to get your required 25 observation hours for grad school admission.",

Anyways! I appreciate the response, I don\u2019t care much for pretty campuses since I\u2019ll be commuting, I wanted to make sure that the program was pretty good or at least alright so yay.",

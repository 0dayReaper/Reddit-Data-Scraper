    "postText": "I'm in my 2nd year at a community college, and I want to be a Marketing major. I'm still trying to figure out which CSU I want to transfer to, and I'm leaning more toward CSULA. The CSULA's pre-reqs for marketing majors seem simpler than other schools. I heard from other people that this school is \"boring\" because it's a commuter school, but I'm honestly not too concerned about campus life since I have other things to rush to like my job and more! I'm just more so worried about the professors and the quality of education. What are your thoughts on this? Is this a good school for business majors?",

            "comment": "I was in your shoes not too long ago, but as an HR option. Wondering if CSUN or Pomona was gonna give me better opportunities. But the extra cost of tuition and commuting put me off. \n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s what you make it. If you can join a marketing club, a speaking club like toast masters, build your connections, get a few references from profs,  secure an internship, then yes CSULA\u2019s program is plenty enough. \n\nI\u2019ve had multiple internship interviews for summer , none cared about my degree being from CSULA. They cared more about the stuff I\u2019m doing on the side.  I feel prepared going out into my first role. I\u2019m able to hold conversations about the field with recruiters. If you were trying to go into med or law school, the school matters. But if you wanna do marketing, you\u2019ll be fine. Get to CSULA, immediately look into clubs, get on professors good side, build your resume, ask them to look over your resume during office hours, I guarantee you will be better off than someone from CSUF who\u2019s doing nothing on the side, which most of students do nothing until graduation lol",

I was worried about jobs not hiring me and might compare me to other graduates from csuf and csulb since they have pretty well-known business programs as well. I'm actually an assistant manager at a restaurant as well (started off as a regular staff and moved my way up), so hopefully, that will help with my resume!",

Part of my degree was marketing and I really enjoyed all of the marketing professors and marketing classes. So much so that I did my business elective credits with more marketing classes. \n\nIn terms of learning its a great school. But its business department is lacking. The only thing I got from the department was this little bag of stuff because I was on the deans list. I recommend joining a business club or marketing club to make the most out of it.",

I've checked rate my professor's website and saw so many complaints, so I was definitely worried about the professors. Although most of the complaints were based on the school and not so much on professors, I still psyched myself out.",

After reading the other comments, I might check out what their business clubs have to offer though. I'm glad that you were happy with the program! I feel a lot better after reading about your guys' experiences. Thank you for sharing!",

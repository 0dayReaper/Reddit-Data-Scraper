With all the experience I had I don\u2019t know what else they wanted from me, it\u2019s so disheartening.\n\nI think they are letting people know next week right? So i think you\u2019re still good.

Thank you, good luck to you also I appreciate that I'm not the only one going thru this uncertainty haha.

It\u2019s also cheaper than Alliant, it\u2019s also CACREP accredited while Alliant isn\u2019t. But it doesn\u2019t have PPS so that\u2019s a hurdle I\u2019ll tackle in a few years.",

    "postText": "I was accepted into all Cal States and I am down to these last two schools.  I am currently trying to decide which school is best in terms of social life and education. I've been doing so much research into both schools and reading reviews but in the end I still don't know what to do. I thnk I'm leaning more towards CPP for their Information Systems since I've heard that is better in the education department and the social life is dependant on myself.   \n\n\nI wanted to hear it from you guys on your pros and cons of the school of CPP and Cal State LA for their social life/computer informations systems major.  \n\n\nI would be commuting to both schools since I live in the middle of both of them with CPP being a couple minutes more.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m an incoming junior",

My favorite professors no longer work there and I had some really terrible professors, so I definitely prefer the staff at Cal State LA. And the campus is just so far removed from LA. If you can get over that, I guess you can enjoy the on-campus brewery, which is awesome.\n\nAs always, it depends on your program and your living situation, among many other things, but I'm always going to suggest Cal State LA over Cal Poly Pomona.",

I have no idea what Pomona is like since I've never been there. but if I had both options without having gone to CSULA I would have chosen Pomona. personally speaking going to CSULA did not hold me back at all, there were many opportunities to learn things, I got a great internship and was able to get a job fairly quickly ( faster if I would have applied to jobs senior year).\n\nalso I work with folks that went to Pomona, UCI, Fullerton, and UCR among other universities. I honestly cant say that I feel they know more than me, that I am lacking or have a larger tool set to draw from. how ever this is very subjective and just my personal experience.",

Don't get me wrong, I suspect you'd do just fine at CSU-LA as well, but CPP has a more tech focus while here has a banger nursing program and a lot of good liberal arts classes that help expand your perspective. If this is just a better job kind of goal, I'd go with CPP.",

I did it due to location and transportation issues, but if you're able to get to Cal Poly Pomona without any of that then do it.\n\nCSULA has the worst Administration who does NOT care about their students. They're here for the money and nothing else. Our ASI board does NOT advocate for our needs and so we're left to try and advocate for ourselves. Plus, with the way it's looking graduations will continue to be held in one of our school's PARKING LOTS! \n\nThere's an incoming new interim President who I hope makes some major changes but seeing as he's coming from another CSU who was worse than CSULA, I highly doubt it.\n\nProfessor's are nice at CSULA  but I'm sure they are nice as well at Cal Poly Pomona.",

            "comment": "CIS major here.\n\nIn my final year at CSULA and with a secured job in NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \n\nIn regards to social life, both are commuter schools so social life is what you make of it. Do you plan on joining any clubs/societies? Most students don\u2019t really hang around campus unless it\u2019s related to studying, extracurriculars, or established hangouts. I joined a couple of clubs here and found fulfillment in social interactions for the most part. The CIS program is pretty small meaning you\u2019ll probably see the same people frequently in different classes allowing for more social interactions. \n\nAbout the program itself. Depending on your specialization, you have access to a wide breadth of course knowledge. Want to focus more on hardware/systems architecture? You can do so. Changed your mind and want to focus on Management-tech? Some classes can double count towards a minor in management along with your degree. As for the quality of teachers, the distribution is about the same in any program really. Some professors are wack, some are decent, some are great. However, having experienced all of these types of professors the work is mostly doable given you at put more than bare minimum effort with the occasional slog. Pro-tip: if possible avoid professor Philip Thomas, he actually makes it a hard time for students.\n\nJob opportunities? Since we are under the Business and Economics college has access to quite a lot of opportunities for learning, internships, jobs, etc. Personally, I\u2019ve felt that our major stands out more among the usual Bus Admin kids but who knows. As long as you remain proactive about opportunities you shouldn\u2019t have have much of a hard time finding some. Our college has direct connections to some pretty big firms such as: Deloitte, KPMG, Aerojet Rocketdyne, JPL, FBI, Edison, to name a few. The rotation changes based on the hiring season/market conditions but I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got a solid roster. \n\nAll in all, it\u2019s really what you make of it. If I had to do it all over again I personally would. If you don\u2019t mind spending some time doing your own research to learn and build your knowledge on some topics I imagine this would be a good program for you to take. \n\nP.S. Alas, I am biased as I have not personally experienced the program in CPP, but I have also heard good things for that program as well! Hopefully someone from that program can give you some good insights to help you make a decision!",

I made some good friends from my classes but definitely being a student worker helped me make more connections. I also took the Metrolink and made a friend for the commute. All the professors I had were great at CSULA. I had previously transferred from CSUDH and I hated that school, so CSULA was a better fit. \n\nWherever you choose, I\u2019d recommend either getting a job on campus and/or joining a club and that could help you meet more people. \n\nHave you done any campus tours?",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI applied to the joint doctoral program in special education with CSULA/UCLA. Did anyone else apply for the 2022-23 school year? I submitted my application at the end of November but know that application deadline was Jan. 14. I feel so anxious as I haven\u2019t heard back yet. I\u2019m getting my master\u2019s in special ed from CSUN this spring. This is my dream program. \u2764\ufe0f",

I finished everything on the csu apply website app. There wasn\u2019t a departmental app. My only guess is it could be a clerical error because they apparently needed my official transcripts and their message ended up in my spam folder. I saw it a few weeks ago (only a week after they sent) and I sent my official transcripts back to them. They said all was good. I\u2019m freaking out and praying it was a mistake. I just emailed admissions. :(",

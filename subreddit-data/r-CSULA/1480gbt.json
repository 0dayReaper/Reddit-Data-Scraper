Ultimately the only way to find out is applying. \n\nAlso if i were to do it again id apply to uc\u2019s too little did i know they can offer more financial aid than csu\u2019s . I have a problem committing things to longterm memory and the qtr system works in my favor since theyre shorter than semesters.",

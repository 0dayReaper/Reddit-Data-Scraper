    "postText": "Im a Junior in high school right now and Im bombing algebra 2 (math was never my strong suit) and I may have to attend summer school, however Im taking honors world history, accelerated business law, and accelerated graphic arts 2, and I will be taking more Acl, Honors, and 1 AP next year. Additionally, I have straight As in every course except math and my gpa this year is good although it wasnt for my first 2 years (like a 2.6 even though last year doent really count due to covid). All that said, you think I could get in as a communications major?",

            "comment": "Hey. I failed two attempts at college, on top of having terrible highschool records. After years away from academics I went to PCC graduated and then applied to Cas State LA. I got in easily and graduated with honors. What I am saying is that a failure will not hold you back. \n\nHowever, even though Cal State LA is cheap, I would recommend going to a community college first. It is cheaper, just as good, and you can experiment. You might not even want to do communications after all. \n\nWhen I started community college I was super down on myself, I thought it wasn't as good as a University. But, in the end, no one has ever asked about where I started. Also, PCC has much more culture since people hang out there a lot.",

I loved PCC and transferring was the best choice I made. \n\nYou can receive a lot of funding from community college and experience great professors (who aren\u2019t always as burnt out as CSULA) \n\nI\u2019m a transfer psych major - whatever happens, you got this!",

But as part of General Education, you need to take one course that satisfy \"Quantitative Reasoning\", which is not that hard (depends on professor).\n\nBut yes I agree it's a very good idea to attend community college first. it's a lot cheaper. I don't know why more people do it.",

    "postText": "please excuse me if this might be an obvious question - but before I go to an advisor (I\u2019ve met with a different one each time and they always seem annoyed) I want to see if anyone has experienced it/give advice.\n\nOne of the core classes that I NEED to graduate (soc4600) isn\u2019t being offered for winter or spring and im aiming to graduation spring 2023. Is the schedule now set or should I wait to see if it gets added?! \ud83d\ude2b\n\nAlso, I do take the blame for waiting last minute but I was trying to avoid taking it with the professor that taught it this semester and last.",

I\u2019m also set to graduate in Spring 2023 too. I contacted my advisor and they said that they would talk to the division to see if there is a suitable substitute for the classes. So it\u2019s possible you could take something else instead to replace the classes. But REACH OUT TO YOUR ADVISOR NOW so that arrangements can be made. Don\u2019t wait. And still submit your application to graduate.",

I would be unsurprised if this is not completely normal for any given uni.",

Best thing for you to do is get ahold of a transfer counselor at PCC and if you're really worried, shoot some emails over to the transfer and/or academic counseling departments at CSULA. But iirc the ADT verification isn't nearly as important as getting in your final transcripts on time anyway.",

I did not pass classes my last semester at CC that would have awarded me a regular associate\u2019s degree and CSULA did not care, as long as your gpa remains in the needed range and you have the golden 4 classes, I think you will be fine",

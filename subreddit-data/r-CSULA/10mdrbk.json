Eating two or three balanced meals a day will help meet this goal along with a protein shake or two as well.\n\nEating well and balanced will completely change your energy levels in every facet of your workout (before, during, and after). \n\nThis doctor on YouTube simplifies building your plates really well: https://youtu.be/7FM9VAH_EXw\n\nIt\u2019s tough starting out at first especially if you\u2019re a college student on a budget or used to eating out which was the case for me. But cooking can be fun and helps you with your goal in the long run.",

I can help with the first far more than the second.   \n\n\n2nd question: what's your experience level? Total novice is different than somebody who is looking for advice from where to go.    \n\n\nI could post more, but lemme wait for the answers to these two questions.",

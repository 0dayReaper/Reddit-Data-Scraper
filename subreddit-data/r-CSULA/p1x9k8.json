Like wtf, there's a reason it was originally 25 people and now with the Delta variant you're not only risking the original 25 students but now and added 10 students.\n\nSome of us have family members who are immunocompromised and can't get the shots &amp; now we have to be even more careful around them. Had to let my mom know she won't be able to be around me for the semester since I don't want to risk infecting her even if I am vaccinated.",

So far, I have t really felt like I was part of a community yet, even though the honors college prides themselves of it. But since we\u2019re going back to in person, maybe your experience will be a bit different. The staff are readily available so if you have questions, they are more than happy to help. Right now I\u2019m planning out my honors thesis and Dr. McCurdy has been such a great help with advising. When the Honors canvas becomes available for you, make sure to go through all the requirements and get started on your services hours in your first semester so that you\u2019re not waiting til the last minute to get them done. If you have any specific questions about the program, feel free to reach out to me. I\u2019ll try to clarify as much as I can.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a transfer student this year... so far it\u2019s been quite the process jumping through hoops. Not many answers, and false information. \n\nI did do orientation- seemed like a total waste of time. They didn\u2019t even give any advisement on classes to take. Registration was the following day after orientation. **Still no advisement of any kind.**\n\nEvery time I reached out before orientation trying to get advisement they would always respond \u201cyou have to wait until orientation to get advisement\u201d lol... well that doesn\u2019t make sense considering I\u2019m already ready to sign up for classes the following day after orientation. \n\nOne guy even got back to me and said \u201cI see you\u2019re on the August 13th list for advisors, someone should be in contact with you then\u201d- hilarious because no one was in contact with me and August 13th was already a week and a half AFTER my registration date. \n\nI ended up taking hours of my own time going through different degrees and figuring out their prerequisites for classes and stuff. Even now I\u2019m not fully sure that I\u2019m doing what I should be course-wise because no one has even looked at my transcripts to see how far or close I am to certain degrees. This school is a mess. \n\nI know this is a state school and a pandemic but come on. I\u2019ve been to three other colleges and their system is the worst. Yikes. Not a good impression at all.",

            "comment": "Happened to me last year when I transferred, basically took me the entire year before I finally felt like I had any footing and that was all done by doing my own work finding resources. No held or support whatsoever. Basically wasted a year just trying to figure out what the fuck was going on and how my major credits even worked and what I needed. I can look back on it now and laugh about how absurd it was but I\u2019m still pretty bitter about the fact that I\u2019m basically just now going into a full semester of classes and degree understanding this year when I could be going into my senior year if I had been given any type of direction or suppport whatsoever. I just want to be done already..",

Like I still don\u2019t have any fricken clue how I have over 150 credits already and still need 2 full years of 6 classes each term and 2 classes every summer/winter term in order for me to barely scrape by for graduation in 2022??? Also idk if it was just me but I transferred with an AA &amp; AD-T w/ all my gen Ed\u2019s fully satisfied yet now that I\u2019m here I have huge gaps in my lower division gen Ed\u2019s that I know I already took&amp; triple checked before transferring that they would be transferable and satisfy my degree requirement??? This school sends me into such a tailspin sometimes, especially coming from a CC where you master your plan and all the ins and outs and ven your plan post transfer then you get here and nothing makes sense and you have to relearn everything and nobody gives you enough direction or support to actually get you to any point where you can follow through with cohesively",

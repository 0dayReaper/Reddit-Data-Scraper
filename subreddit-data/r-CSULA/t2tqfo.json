    "postText": "I'm having a really difficult time sorting out which is the better option here. I applied to LB but because my CC doesn't offer one of their prerequisite classes, I got automatically rejected before I could submit a portfolio. I've appealed the decision but multiple professors have warned me away because the snobbery at LB rivals UCLA (their words, not mine.) I'm on some of the other schools' subs and there isn't a lot of helpful information. My goal is to do UI/UX graphic design. CSUF has an Graphic &amp; Interactive Design program, but all the students at the school are constantly warning people away (especially transfers) and saying to go to places like LB instead.\n\nHonestly, I like that LA is so close to where I live, but I really need to make the best decision regarding my future career... and that's in UI/UX/Graphic Design (or at least product design.)\n\nIs LA a good fit? Should I consider Northridge? DH, I've been told, has a non-existent art program so that's pretty much off the list. I've posted in so many places and haven't received much of a response. If there's anyone in CSULA's art program that can tell me what it's like, or someone who has transferred between ANY of the CSUs I listed above, that would really help.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Have you tried contacting the art department or any professors at the schools you applied to? Explain what you said here and ask if they are able to provide any help/info to help you decide where to go. Some probably won't reply, but it's worth a try. Be polite and thank them for their time. They could also hopefully get you in touch with current students. Did you see if there are any art clubs on those campuses? That might be another way to connect with current students.",

            "comment": "hopefully some art students will be able to give better insight into that specific major. I chose CSULA because their fin aid package was better than the CSU closer to me (CSUCU) but I am really struggling a bit trying to commute even monday and friday and staying in an airbnb during the week while I look for an apartment. If the financial aid is good enough and it is close enough for you to easily commute (I would say within a half hour, maybe up to an hour depending on comfortable your car is) then the campus is nice enough and everyone is nice. I would not come from far away unless you are really into the idea with dorming with a roommate, because of the cost of housing and how hard it is to find affordable housing.",

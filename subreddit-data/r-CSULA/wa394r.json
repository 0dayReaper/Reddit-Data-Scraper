    "postText": "I am a transfer student for fall 2022. I have no idea how to work anything on the student portal. My main question is do i need to complete orientation before I'm allowed to apply for Fall 2022? My next question is that my orientation is on Aug 10 and I saw that classes start on Aug 22 will it be to late for me to find a class? \n\nP.s  I'm a music major if that helps at all. \n\nThank you in advance. I hope I can find some answers.",

            "comment": "Unfortunately you have to wait for orientation to register for classes and as a fellow transfer student, I\u2019m angry with you. I\u2019m in public health and tbh I\u2019m pissed us transfers aren\u2019t given the same priority that upper division class members have when it comes to registering because a lot of my core classes are all waitlisted. \n\nThe advisors have been ZERO help for me because every time I reached out to ask about it and discuss my concerns they kept saying that I can\u2019t make an advisement appointment until my orientation either. I\u2019ve honestly felt really shit out of luck as a transfer student so far and I\u2019m pretty pissed about it.\n\nCall your department and let them know your predicament, maybe they\u2019ll be help.",

Us transfers have such limited class options that not being able to get our classes in the Fall may seriously affect our ability to graduate on time.",

But yeah I mean I agree totally bc I wanted to graduate in 2 years but now I\u2019m starting to feel like it might be 2 1/2 - 3 years",

You would just search the classes it days in your degree planner",

    "postText": "Hello all! I'm planning on applying to the single-subject credential program at CSULA and was wondering what my prospects of getting accepted are. I'm asking because I'm also debating applying for CSUDH as a back up in the event I don't get into CSULA or CSUN (my number 1 choice, due to the ACT program they have), but don't want to unless I really have to (that is, if my chances of getting into LA or Northridge are slim). I have a 3.35 GPA and a fair bit of experience in education, if that affects anything. Thank you in advance for the input!",

Even if you miss a document, the office of admissions will reach out to make sure you do. I attended a lot of the info sessions and someone always asks about the admissions rate. Usually the response is a chuckle followed by a \"we have a very... VERY high rate of acceptance as long as all the documents are in.\" Make sure you answer all the questions on the philosophy statement and attend the info sessions. Good luck!",

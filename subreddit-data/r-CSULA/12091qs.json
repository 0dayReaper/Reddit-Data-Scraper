            "comment": "hello, I'm currently a pre-nursing student at cal state la and there's a few things I want to share! first off, pre-nursing is apparently one of the most selective majors here so congrats :). however, they also admit a lot of pre-nursing students for very very few spots into the nursing school. this is how it is for any pre-nursing program though. many of the prenursing students I've met (myself included) dorm on campus.\n\nif you look up the traditional BSN application page on the cal state la SON website there is a lot of good information about the exact prereqs you have to take, what they expect for the TEAS, and the requirements for work or volunteer experience (although work experience is weighted more). you can do prereqs either in one or two years, but the prereqs are very difficult and from what I've seen a lot of people who do one year struggle a lot because it's two heavy science classes per semester, chemistry/anatomy and then physiology/microbio. your required to get a b or above in any science class or you're not eligible to apply for the nursing program. this isn't explicitly stated in any other programs like CSULB but with the GPAs of accepted applicants it's basically an unsaid rule. I'm personally doing 2 years of prereqs because I want to have a higher gpa and more work experience before applying. if accepted into the nursing program it's 3 years!\n\np.s. I hear a lot of people who want to become an NP which is a really amazing goal, but also please don't forget about building a strong foundation in your nursing knowledge/skills. there's a lot of truth in the saying that RNs who were CNAs before gain a lot of perspective that helps ground you and see the bigger picture of your nursing team and that definitely extends to pursuing specialized nursing.\n\nif you have any more questions please reply here because I know as someone interested in nursing there was not a lot of information about the school available and I would love for other people to see this :)",

If i attend CSULA i would need to live on campus, so I just want a better understanding on how life is over there? Second question is in terms of work experience, does the school reach out to you and offer programs to apply? Or do we have to do all that on our own? (sorry if I sound lazy or anything, just genuinely curious.)",

I work and volunteer but they only accept either work or volunteer experience for the application, I just like the exposure",

Pre-nursing students get priority, which is either equal to/ranked above community college applicants as part of local preference.",

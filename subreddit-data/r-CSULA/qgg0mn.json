    "postText": "Hello! If anyone is interested in self-defense (not limited to women) or stunts there are classes for Spring 2022. I had the professor who's teaching it before and it's definitely an easy A. I'm taking both of these classes, and I hope you guys can join too! It was sad to see his classes canceled because they were in person during the Fall.",

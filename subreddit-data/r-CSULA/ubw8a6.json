I\u2019m new to this forum so sorry if this has been answered before. \n\nI\u2019m an incoming low income transfer student and i\u2019m filling out the housing application but i\u2019m really stuck on whether I should put that I want a double or triple.\n\nWhat are your guys opinion of both? Is it worth it to spend a bit more money to get the double or is a triple fine? \n\nThank you!",

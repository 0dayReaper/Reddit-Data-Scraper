            "comment": "For English definitely Professor Briggs. He teaches an English class but the entire class is about AI and nothing more. He assigns a quiz at the start of every class period and two separate homework assignments after every class(which is three times a week). He assigns three five page essays a semester which he grades VERY STRICTLY, and for his final asks two more five page essays submitted at the same time. \n\nThe last time I checked he has a 1.9/5 on rate my professors. If you want to know more about what professors are good and bad at CSULA I would highly recommend using Rate My Professors. I have been using it since having Briggs and I haven\u2019t had a bad professor since.",

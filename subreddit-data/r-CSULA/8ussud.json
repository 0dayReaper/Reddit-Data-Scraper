It has a list of every class in the school and how many As, A-s, Bs etc the class had.\n\nFun fact, in my Physics class the GPA was 1.39. No one got an A, and there were 6 Bs out of 76 students who completed the class lmao. 65% of the class failed. What bullshit, don't take Ishimura for physics 2200 if your life depends on it.",

Chem 1040 is an introductory chem class for engineers, not organic chem which is one of the hardest college classes.  A classmate and I asked Professor Kimo Yap for help once.  He refused to help us, he said that he had already covered that topic in class.  We attended his class but later had follow up questions that he would not answer.",

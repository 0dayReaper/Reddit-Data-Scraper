    "postText": "Just wondering if anyone got their spring disbursement to see if they started going out yet. My GET shows a hold that updates every Friday with that days date. (They said the hold is for their own info in office)I spoke to financial aid in January who said all would be disbursed by end of February but it\u2019s end of March now and I haven\u2019t received mine yet.\n\nEDIT: I see some have gotten their spring disbursement already. I didn\u2019t attend school for fall so I didn\u2019t receive one, only for spring. I wonder if that\u2019s why I\u2019m maybe in the last group? Any ideas for those who haven\u2019t gotten theirs either?",

She said this could take up to 3 Weeks but maybe sooner because they have all hands on deck trying to get it done. \n\nThe holds should resolve themselves as they review your amount and batch Your disbursement.",

I\u2019m really don\u2019t want to purchase food just because of how expensive that can be. I\u2019ll be spending all day there now, just wondering where I could store my food and stuff. Thanks!",

I was told it would be best that I carried a lunch bag which can hold an ice pack to keep the food from spoiling..",

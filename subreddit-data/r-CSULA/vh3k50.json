    "postText": "Hi! Anyone here from CSULA and happens to be an International Student? Just wanna ask a few things.\n\n1. How was the application process? Was it tedious? Did you have a hard time processing documents coming from your school to the IERF?\n\n2. How's International Student Life in the area? Do you live on campus or off-campus?\n\n3. Are there any teaching assistant jobs international students can apply to?",

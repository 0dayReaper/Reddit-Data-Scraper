    "postText": " \n\nHello everyone!\n\nMy name is Damian, and I'm an aerospace engineering student at UC Irvine. I've created a club called The Futurist Society where we discuss future trends and technologies. We talk about flying cars, reusable rockets, fusion power, and much more. We also have plans to start doing projects as our org gets more established.\n\nThis post is being made on behalf of our CSULA chapter, which is in the process of forming. We have a national network of students interested in shaping the future! If you're looking to learn more about technology and futurism, looking to network with like-minded students, or are just interested in cool tech, come join us today!\n\nTFS CSULA Discord:  [https://discord.gg/y5ppcJxqn9](https://discord.gg/y5ppcJxqn9)  \n\nTFS National Discord: [https://discord.gg/3a9eepuC9P](https://discord.gg/3a9eepuC9P)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b60zf75fws481.png?width=1545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8c66cd22d2784555c75d070b462a7f56f4cefff1",

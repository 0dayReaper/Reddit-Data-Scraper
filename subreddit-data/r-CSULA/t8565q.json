    "postText": "Hi, Like the title says, Im looking for more information on where I can find the equivalent courses below at a community college. Im a Math undergrad looking to pursue a Masters in CS. Advisors referred me to assist.org but none of the community colleges in my area have any 3000 or 4000 courses equivalents. Is my only option to take these at CSULA? Any help would be much appreciated\n\n\n\u2022   Completed a course in Design and Analysis of Algorithms (Cal State LA: CS 3112)\n\n\u2022   Completed a course in Formal Languages and Automata Theory (Cal State LA: CS 3186)\n\n\u2022    Completed a course in Software Engineering (Cal State LA: CS 3337)\n\n\u2022    Completed a course in Operating Systems (Cal State LA: CS 4440)",

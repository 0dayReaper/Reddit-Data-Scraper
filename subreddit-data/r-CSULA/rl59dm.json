Want to apply your skills in marketing, writing, science, finance, business, advocacy, and so on to a good cause?\n\nConsider joining the Cal State LA chapter of the [University Blood Initiative](https://www.universitybloodinitiative.org/) (UBI).\n\nClick [here](https://www.universitybloodinitiative.org/join-a-chapter) to signup to be part of our chapter. All members of the Cal State LA community are welcome!\n\nThe purpose of the UBI is to end blood shortages to prevent more unnecessary deaths. Our vision is to revolutionize the blood world to create a sustainable and equitable blood supply.\n\nCurrently, we are focusing on expanding the donor pool within the United States via our unique University Chapter Model which heavily focuses on education.\n\nIn addition to our chapter encouraging young and diverse populations to donate to Carter Blood Donation Center, we also participate in advocacy work. We believe it is not fair to engage such populations without also fighting to make the blood world a fair and more equitable place. Our major focuses are the MSM deferral, racism in the history of donation, and sickle cell disease. For example, we partnered with COLLAGE, GMHC, and ACT UP on our Advocacy Art Challenge.\n\nPlease feel free to message me with any questions you might have. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5fmduat2ht681.png?width=1234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3215623c836d33e496921cd57cd8b21d9f2fcf5b",

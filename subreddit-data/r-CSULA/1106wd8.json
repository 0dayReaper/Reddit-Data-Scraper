    "postText": "Hi guys, i got accepted to CSULA for pre-nursing this fall and I\u2019m considering to commit there because of both my major and my minor I\u2019m planning to do which is Japanese Lang. I have done Japanese 101, and this sem, 102, at my local community college via dual enrollment and we use the Genki books from what both my prof and online tells me, Genki is the commonly used Japanese textbook in most US universities and colleges. I don\u2019t know anyone at CSULA who has done Japanese to help me out. Would I be still able to use my Genki textbook for CSULA or do they use a different book series? Also where would I start if I ended finished Japanese 102 at community college. Will they test me for the next level or just throw me right in? Thanks I\u2019m advance guys",

Other Japanese students who did their undergraduate courses here have told me they used the Genki books for beginner and intermediate courses too, which is equal to like 4 classes: beginner 1-2 and intermediate 1-2. I'm bringing this up because csula is a little behind with how they teach them. I finished Japanese 4, equivalent to intermediate 2 level right, when I got here to csula they put me in Japanese 3001 and we used the genki 2 book for a bit but still had to buy another one as well. Since you completed 102, I'm assuming that's beginner 2 lvl, you'll be put into intermediate here and still use the genki book. If you have any more questions let me know! \u9811\u5f35\u3063\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u2757I know it's a bit confusing with my explanation but hoped it helped! Essentially yes if you're still completing the undergraduate courses you'll be using the Genkis, once you're in the upper division course we use different books!",

Really glad there's another Japanese student joining. Have fun! Also as a quick note there won't be any testing for the next course you'll need if they transfered over on your transcripts correctly. I did get a block on mine when trying to enroll and just needed to be added on by the Japanese director, she's also a sensei, and also declared my minor at the same time. Make sure you declare it ASAP as the Japanese program is small and not all courses are available each semester.",

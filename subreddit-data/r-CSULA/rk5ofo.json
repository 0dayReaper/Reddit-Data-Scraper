    "postText": "Hello!  After a decade of being out of school, I've decided to apply for my MSW.  CSULA is my top choice as well.  \n\n\nHowever, I was wondering, approximately how competitive is the program?  I know that graduate programs don't have to disclose the acceptance rate, but couldn't find this info anywhere.  \nThanks so much!!!",

There are many students in the MSW program that don\u2019t exactly have social work background. It\u2019s a very eclectic field. Most important is to have a strong personal statement and delve deep as to why you want to do social work (because it sure as hell ain\u2019t easy).",

Hopefully that gives me some of an edge?  Anyway, thanks.  I'm probably going to prioritize applying to CSULA and CSUN before all the other schools.  &lt;3",

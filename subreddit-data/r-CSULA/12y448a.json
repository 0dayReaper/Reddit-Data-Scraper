    "postText": "I attended csula's preview day for my major and overall it was informative, at least I thought it was. I went to csun's preview day and the eops director was blunt about the program being difficult even if I quit my full time job and lower my commute to the school by moving closer. I already understood that this was going to require a lot from me because school.\nI live closer to csula by 20 min but even then, a part time job wouldn't be possible.\n\nIs the program harder depending on the school? Any students in the undergraduate program give me some insight on how csulas programs is? Do you like it? Is the material difficult?\nI'm not the smartest student but I can easily give up my life to commit to the program.\nI just want to know if I'll be choosing the right school even if its impossible knowing the outcome\n\nEdit: I'm a transfer student. Don't think it matters tho",

            "comment": "hii , I would definitely look into the communicative disorders major as a whole and see what it offers and how it\u2019ll benefit you because that\u2019s what you\u2019re dedicating another 4 years of education for . I\u2019m an undergrad in comms and so far I really like it and have had great professors within major and outside of my major and that\u2019s also because I picked professors I know I\u2019ll like to have and learn from . Rate my professor is so much help when it comes to the outlook of how the semester will unfold when class starts",

I\u2019m also a comd major (third year) and I really love the program here at csula, I feel like there is a lot of great resources and opportunities in research participation and general participation. In all honesty yes the material can be hard but with organization and time management it is doable. Like someone else said, with rate my professor of course it is of great help and use the resources given like tutoring and office hours. Whichever program you end up picking remember you will be fine  \u25e1\u0308",

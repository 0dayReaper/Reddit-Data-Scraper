So if you're doing the typical fall and spring semesters in a year, you'd be spending about $7,000 on tuition alone. Books and classroom material vary but so far, the **most** I've had to spend in one class would be close to $300 and the **least** I've had to spend (if anything) is $25. Transportation and other living expenses vary for each person.",

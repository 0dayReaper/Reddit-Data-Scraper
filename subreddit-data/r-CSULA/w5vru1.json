I have class 2x a week and for like 3 classes I have \u201ctime conflicts\u201d because of the 10 minute difference between the end of a class and the start but these classes are either in the same building or the other building is next door. I should be okay right?",

If the latter, you really should rework your schedule. I had that happen one time for two classes and the professor of the second class was not cool about it.",

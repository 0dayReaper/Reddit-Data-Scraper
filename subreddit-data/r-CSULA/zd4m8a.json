I'm a college student in LA a part of a team doing a research project for our statistics course, based on how lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak affected academic learning for both college and university students. We\nwould really appreciate it if any North American undergraduate within LA County could take our very short (0.5-1 min.), and completely anonymous, survey regarding online vs. in-person\nlearning. Thank you so much in advance, it means a lot for our research. [Online vs. In-person Learning Survey](https://s.surveyplanet.com/hrjngfjj)",

            "comment": "I took the survey!\n\nit\u2019s a tricky situation for everyone, it almost feels like there are no correct or incorrect answers. I personally don\u2019t like online learning, but I am also very cautious about COVID and would rather be safe so I think that (at least in the first 2 years of the pandemic/before availability of vaccines) going online was the right move. BUT, I like going to class in-person so much more and I\u2019m happy to do it this semester. and I always wear my mask and other students wear theirs as well.",

                    "comment": "Thank you so much. I agree that going online during the first two years was a good decision for everyone. I also agree about the online vs. in-person learning debate being tricky, because it\u2019s just different for everyone. I prefer online learning, just because it\u2019s so convenient to do school work from the comfort of my own home and not have to travel by means of public transportation. I personally haven\u2019t been to my college in person since lockdown first happened. But, I\u2019m looking forward to the upcoming Spring 2023 semester, because it will be my first time back on campus from taking online classes since mid-Spring semester of 2020. I\u2019m glad to read that students are responsible for wearing their masks and you are safe this semester, for the most part, though. Wishing you the best!",

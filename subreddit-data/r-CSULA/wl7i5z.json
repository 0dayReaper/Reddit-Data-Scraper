A 17-year-old also faces charges in juvenile court in connection with the slaying.\r  \n\r  \nDelcid is being held on $2 million bail, arrest records show, and he is expected to be arraigned Wednesday. He faces life without the possibility of parole, Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said during a news conference Wednesday.\r  \n\r  \nOn Monday afternoon, Delcid got out of a nearby vehicle as off-duty officer Gardiel Solorio had just gotten to the parking lot of an L.A. Fitness in Downey.\r  \n\r  \nDelcid allegedly demanded Solorio\u2019s personal items,but as Solorio put his car in reverse, Delcid allegedly shot the victim five times at close range, officials said.\r  \n\r  \nDelcid then returned to his vehicle being driven by the teen and the two drove away. Solorio, 26, died at the scene.\r  \n\r  \nDelcid was arrested by Downey police on Tuesday, records show.\r  \n\r  \nAuthorities provided no further details into what led them to Delcid and the teen.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://ktla.com/news/local-news/arr...olice-officer/",

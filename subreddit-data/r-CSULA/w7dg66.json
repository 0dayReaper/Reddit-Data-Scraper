    "postText": "I saw this same issue posted here a few days ago but no answer. I need to pay over $5000 in housing fees and Transact wants me to pay out of pocket. I literally do not have $5000 to my name; but I have enough financial aid to cover it. The problem is that there's no option for me to pay for it using my FA. I cannot attend the school if this is not resolved but I don't know what to do or who to talk to",

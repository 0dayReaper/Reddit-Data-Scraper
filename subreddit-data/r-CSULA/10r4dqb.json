The only time it is difficult to fix is when they are designed to be difficult (or impossible) to fix, like Airpods.  They are specifically designed to be unfixable so you buy more.  \n\nIt's like riding a bike.",

They are a very good design house and do a good job of making it hard for anyone. I know what to do, I know how to do it, but there is still a chance I'd break it anyway because of how the glue is applied.  \n\nIf the screen works and has a small crack, I'd just keep it as is unless it is absolutely maddening to you.  \n\n  \nIf the screen is completely cracked through and you can't use it anyway, then yeah, let's give it a go, but just be ready to have it be a write-off.",

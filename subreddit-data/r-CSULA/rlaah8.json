Is that still Canvas CANVAS or will there be a time-stamp next to the \"Online ONLINE\"? \n\n(For spring semester 2022)",

I know some classes are being changed from in person to online and vice versa, and this will apparently continue to happen for a small number of classes until January. I like my schedule but i try to check back every few days to see if I have noticed any changes",

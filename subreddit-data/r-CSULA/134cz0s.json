            "comment": "Same thing happened to me. If you attended a school in California, contact your high school and see if they still have your immunization records on file since they usually travel with you from school to school. If they don't, they'll probably tell you where you can get them. If you attended school within the LAUSD school district, you can go online to their website and request your Immunization records from them, if your high school no longer has them.\n\nKeep in mind though that they might not have the latest updated copy so you might have to get some shots re-done (I had to do that).\n\nOr like the other person suggested, you can make an appointment with the Student Health Center and have them test you to see which shots you've had but I belive they charge you for this, so make sure to ask about pricing.",

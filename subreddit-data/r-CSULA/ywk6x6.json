We are to looking at the relationship between sex attitudes and behaviors. \n\nCan you please take my short survey? \n\nWeb link:\n\nhttps://qfreeaccountssjc1.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a4BN2AL1ICbwMoS",

This will help in making sure that participants read through all your questions and did not accidentally skip them. Accidentally forgetting a question is not the same as choosing to not respond.\n\n\n2. The second to last question assumes that all who take this survey were lied to in order to have sex. Maybe a previous question can be asked such as, \"Do you believe you were ever lied to and coerced into having sex? Please answer either Yes or No.\"\nThe follow up question can then be the same one, but with an added option that states, \"I do no believe I was lied to at any point.\"\n\nThis will allow you to get a different set of data to compare between those who feel they were lied to vs those who don't.\n\nI hope this is constructive! Best of luck with this project. :)",

Oftentimes we aren't sure if the steps we take will result the way we want them, but when they do, it let's us know our hard work is paying off.\n\nBest wishes and I truly hope you get to present at the conference.",

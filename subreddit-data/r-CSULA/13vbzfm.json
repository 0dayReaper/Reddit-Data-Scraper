    "postText": "So I\u2019m on academic probation I had a 1.1 gpa last term (2021-2022)now I have a 1.8 since I passed all my classes fall semester but this semester has been lackluster and I\u2019ve failed one class the rest I passed but I ended up getting a D+ because my professor didn\u2019t want to round up.Am I gonna get kicked out? I really tried well and I don\u2019t wanna get kicked out and have to pay all the pell grants they gave me.Someone give their experience.Im an under grad second year heading into 3rd year for context.And I only need one class to declare my major since I have 44 of the credits I need.Has this happened to any of u failing one class on academic probation?",

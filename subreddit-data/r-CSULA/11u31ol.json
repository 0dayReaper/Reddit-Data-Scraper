We also need people who don\u2019t use either to serve as controls. There is ONE\r session that lasts about 1 hour and compensation is $50. See attached flyer for more\r information. If you are interested or if you know anyone who may be eligible, please email us at [iruedisueli@mednet.ucla.edu](mailto:iruedisueli@mednet.ucla.edu) Thank you :)",

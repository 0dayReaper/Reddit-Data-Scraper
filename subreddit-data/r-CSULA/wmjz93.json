    "postText": "I got an e-mail saying I need to send verified documents. If I was 18 when i graduated highschool I could send my transcripts. However, since I was 17 they are requesting information from my dad (whom i lived with). Tax returns from almost 7 years ago. Funny thing is our relationship is rocky so im dreading to even discuss with him, due to our lack of relationship for reasons. Anyone encounter this situation before? Don't really know what I'm expecting for an answer, just wanted to vent I guess. Why the hell would they need information from so long ago. Been on my own for since I graduated and it frustrating :D",

Literally, I would rather stub my toe (very hard, like very very hard) than have to discuss any kind of aid or college curriculum with my father. \n\nI have been on my own since the start of the pandemic (cheers to us for getting the fudge out of there). But, I would say that contacting the financial aid office or setting up an appointment with a f.a office member might be a good start. You can set this up on your CSULA email. \n\nI am also here to help if you need it! Good luck friend!",

Went on there and saw no appointments were open, nor did I have the option to check if there are appointments open for the month of september. Just to be clear, are you advising I should directly e-mail my financial aid advisor through the csula email? If so, I will try that right now, just incase as well :$",

Like I dont get it? Im more distracted looking at people and their rooms than the lecture + it wont stop someone from doing something else during lectures.",

If you get distracted during lecture I suggest using speaker view on zoom. It's an option that will give the professor the biggest screen. Hopefully that works for you (:",

This prof also said computers were MANDATORY but alot of people in the lecture dialed in from their phones so :/ I kinda want to keep my camera off until I have a question or its time for discussion but I dont think this prof is anyway near lenient about this.",

I definitely think she cant enforce this forever as theres 40 students all with different situations. Plus she already mentioned shes going to be going over slides as lecture so how can she see all 40 of us? As long as Im present in the call as you\u2019re lecturing, that is all that should matter.",

My professors for fall are pretty lenient since they know not everyone has a school space. My professors only required it during presentations or if we had discussions. But if your professor is like heavily insisting, I suggest looking at the legal laws. That\u2019s what many students were doing.",

Like I replied to someone else \u2014 I dont mind having the camera and mic on when its time for questions or discussions, but to make it mandatory? Thats so off putting especially for students that are self conscious, or anxious, or just have alot going on in their household. If I didnt live in a tiny 1bd apt with multi-family members, I probably wouldnt mind having my camera on for the full lecture since I wouldnt be in my bed.",

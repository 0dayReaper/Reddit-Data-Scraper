(Image below) \n\nAlso, my professor stated that the access code that comes with the textbook can be used for both classes (like \"part 1\" and a \"part 2,\" to put it that way). Would paying for this Single Term Access mean I'd have to buy the plan again for the \"part 2\" class? \n\nWould it be better to simply buy the textbook for almost $200 in the college bookstore? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ltrm5gkzlbd81.png?width=1197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6d874791fdcbed789953a6b32735b63f98e0c579",

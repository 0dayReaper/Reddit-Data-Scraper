The library has many many floors and they have different rules I think the lowest levels have like super quiet rules . Other than that, the neighborhood is nice \u2026 run around campus . Alhambra is also not too far away lots of good places to eat on Valley . &amp; there are social clubs , wait for the recruitment week and go check them all out .",

I am a transfer student who is from the OC. \n\nLocally, Montebello, Monterey Park, and the Arts District are super close to campus if you enjoy good food, fusion spots, or want to experience some new culture. \n\nI would say that the club rush is more during the afternoon or morning, so if you want to check those out, you might need to arrive a little earlier depending on your schedule. Some clubs hand out free swag - so if that is your jam, totally go for it. I know there is a religious-based clubs, reading clubs, Greek life, and some other misc. clubs. \n\nI have not been to the gym, but it is sometimes crowded- again, it depends on your class schedule. There are some rec sports clubs that the student-athletes initiate to practice and get to know some more people. I am not sure where you would find that specific info though. \n\nAs for the library, both wings (there are two wings) are very different. Depending on what you are looking for, every level is different. The second-level group room is usually where buddies hang out to study and chat. There is no noise level control in this area- it is pretty noticeable. The lowest levels and the highest levels have study rooms that you can rent out if you need to be free of distractions to study. Also, the library aids will help you rent out a room like that or show you where a quiet place is. There are iso-pods with sorta-comfy chairs with individual desks and lights, these are on the library's main level with all the shelves. \n\nLet me know how this works out! The MyCalStateLA homepage has a lot of useful info too. \n\nBest of luck! :)",

            "comment": "[In general, public universities in the United States tend to have broad protections for academic freedom](https://www.aaup.org/issues/academic-freedom/professors-and-institutions). However, academic freedom generally entails freedom to follow independently guided research endeavors. Faculty can discuss a broad range of topics in their classes, but students are generally considered a \"captive audience\" in those settings so whatever is discussed must align with the purpose of the class. Faculty academic freedom does not enable instructors of any political persuasion or religious affiliation to use their classroom as a place to proselytize or to use class time to conjecture about their political beliefs. They can share their professional or scholarly opinions on a variety of matters if it relates to the class topic (e.g., a religious studies class might be a place to discuss the ethics of abortion as considered by different religious faiths or a particular faith) but such discourse would be wholly out of place in an intermediate college algebra class. If you feel what your professor did goes against these general principles, you can discuss it with the professor's department chair or the dean of students.",

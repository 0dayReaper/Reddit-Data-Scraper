            "comment": "&gt;When you say CSU students can take a free online class, does this really mean free?\n\n&gt;If you paid your full-time tuition, the additional units for the CSU Fully Online course are included in that tuition. No additional tuition is charged. Nonresidents and international students still pay the additional fees for the units.\n\n\nhttps://www.calstate.edu/attend/student-services/Pages/CSU-Fully-Online-FAQs.aspx",

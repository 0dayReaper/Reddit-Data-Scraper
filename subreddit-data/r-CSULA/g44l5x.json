If anyone on here has had trouble with this you can contact them anonymously to share your experience. \n\nI dont know what will happen with this but it\u2019s important to speak up when given the opportunity. just wanted to share in case no ones heard of whats going on here. \n\nhope you all are doing okay.",

The food pantry isn't essential, access to the library isn't essential, reliable internet for the professors isn't essential but the Luckman still sends weekly emails about their programming? Pathetic!\n\n[https://calstatela.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_3fOKoH9HE6SXRQN](https://calstatela.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3fOKoH9HE6SXRQN)\n\nplease share this link to a survey about Spring 2020\n\nand demand universal grading from your department chair in light of their negligence this semester.",

Would you consider sharing your story with the page? You can share anonymously.\n\nThe school is saying they haven\u2019t denied any grants. Your testimonial is important.",

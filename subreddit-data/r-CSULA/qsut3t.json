    "postText": "Hi friends, \n\nI have been accepted for transfer for the Spring 2022 session. I am not a great student, but I\u2019ve met the requirements for transfer besides my ADT (non-impacted major) being incomplete. I am still taking one course right now for Fall 2021 at my college to fulfill this req. CSULA is aware of all of this, as they\u2019ve accepted me. But I am worried that they will see my transcripts that I\u2019ve submitted recently and rescind my application. I would be devastated if that happened. Some sources have told me that the ADT in progress status is okay, others have not. Do you think I will be alright?\n\nThank you for reading.",

I guess I\u2019ll just have to ask the school when they need my transcripts for my fall class (ends in December). If I pass the class then there should be no question as to whether I can attend. \n\nThank you again!",

So I suggest that as soon as your grade posts on your transcript that you request the copy be sent to your school so like that you're not stressing about it over the Christmas holidays.",

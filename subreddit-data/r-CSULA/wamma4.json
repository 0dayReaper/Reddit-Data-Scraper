    "postText": "Anyone go to any (or know of) local Muay Thai gyms close to campus? I can google some but I\u2019m curious if any golden eagles know of any low key spots or places they go that are legit and safe places to learn. \n\nI want to avoid a mcdojo situation and also not go to a place that\u2019ll work me or beat me till I throw up. I\u2019m also open to other martial arts like grappling and weapons fighting like escrima/kali. \n\nMy budget is like ~$150 a month. Ideally like to practice atleast 3 times a week.\n\nPlease share any insights \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe",

I'm pretty avid about playing games to kill boredom when I'm not doing school assignments, so I wanted to know from someone that also play video games on the schools WiFi.\n\nAnother question! Are we allowed to bring our own router or modem? I'm a senior over the age of 21 so I'll be housing in the apartment complexes for those that are 21 and above.",

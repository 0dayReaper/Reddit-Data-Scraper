    "postText": "I have 3 questions, first one, if I had originally paid for in person orientation and then get an email that states I\u2019ll have my advisor appointment around July 18th will my advisor appointment change if I select a zoom orientation?\n\nNext one, are classes picked with an advisor or at orientation?\n\nLastly, if the in person orientation says it\u2019s for transfers/returners does that mean only transfers/returners? Or does it include freshman?",

A freshman or a transfer/returner",

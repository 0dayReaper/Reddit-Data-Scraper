    "postText": "So I am a transfer student, transferring this fall. I was accepted in Biology BS. I applied in the general option, if I want to emphasise Bio-MCD BS then they would require for me to take Ochem 2. I am taking Ochem 2 and might get a D. In [assist.org](https://assist.org) it is not required for me to take Ochem 2. I would like to know if CSULA will withdraw their admission offer.",

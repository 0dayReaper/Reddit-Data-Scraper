            "comment": "Hi! I am currently enrolled in this program. The program is great itself in that a lot of our instructors are full-time criminalists with the LAPD or LASD. I currently have two instructors who went through the program itself and are now senior/supervising criminalists. This just shows that there is a good chance of getting hired by these agencies after completing the program. There is a set of courses you need to take every semester- these are outlined for you. This makes it really easy to follow. \n\nThe application was a basic CSU application, two letters of recommendation, and a personal statement that answers a prompt. From what I have heard, it is a competitive program. My cohort consists of 20 people currently. \n\nAnother thing to note is that we don't do research right away or work closely with one faculty member our first year. Because of this, we don't get the opportunity to get paid while doing our masters. From what I heard, if there are any opportunities, the second years get first pick. Most of us have regular jobs.  Classes start at 4:30 every day so that we are allowed to have full-time day jobs.",

Do they actually take interest in students' learning, or is teaching secondary to them? How available are they for help?\n\nWould you mind sharing an example schedule?\n\nHow hard is it working full time and doing the courses?\n\nHow's your cohort? Do you collaborate much or is everyone doing their own thing? Especially since you're busy working all day and in class all night. Seems like CSULA is a commuter school at all levels. Not looking for partying or undergrad clubs, just wondering about the social dynamic of the grad program.",

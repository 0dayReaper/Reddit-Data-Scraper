Not sure why you would need to take 18 units per semester? Full-time is 12 units and that's all you need per semester to graduate on time. If you take more than that, you can graduate faster than 4 years but I do not recommend that course of action because you will burn out and get overwhelmed. Each class requires about 6 hours per week of study/homework time outside of class so you really wouldn't be able to do anything else. When it comes to after college, it's more about experiences outside of classes that will lead to better jobs or graduate school so you want to give yourself plenty of time to add academic extracurriculars. Good luck with your choices!",

It's definitely set to be at 15 credits per semester to graduate in 4 years unless moved around otherwise, like summer or winter. Stick to that, and you'll be fine. Whether you pass a class is another issue.\n\nI wouldn't take 18 credits every semester. If you really want to, do it within the semesters that you know will be easier in a sense. I am taking my first 6 credits in the summer, and I will be taking my first 18 credit semester next Fall since I recently added in a minor. I'm about to be a Junior. I could make the remainder of my semesters 18 credits, but I just know that I will be stressed and won't be able to handle it (alongside the time restraint of CSULA's degree planner).",

    "postText": "I'm currently a junior and have been accepted to transfer to CSULA for my (hopefully) final year. I am a computer science major and have exceeded all the transfer requirements except for physics which I'm struggling in right now. My GPA is solid, I've gone past the rest of the preferred and required classes, but am worried I wont get  a good enough grade in Physics. I was told if that were to happen I could file an appeal for taking it the summer before the fall semester, has anyone gone through this process? And if so, how often do they let this happen? I really want to transfer to be closer to home.",

            "comment": "I can't speak too specifically on this topic, but I have been in the position of completing an appeal and taking summer courses. My advice is to talk to a counselor or someone who can advise you on this ASAP! Students who feel like they will not pass a class should make it known also because the appeal process is horribly long, and you have to constantly be calling them to make sure things are getting done. I'd have to call multiple times a week for about 1-2 months. It seems like these processes constantly go through various people to approve and see things, although that might also be a case to case situation.",

Go on the website and fill out the application, as well as an email to the people listed. A committee will review it and hopefully approve! It\u2019s been about two/three years since i did (transferred in 2020 but to a diff school after all lol). But it\u2019s possible and wort a shot, goodluck!",

    "postText": "Hi, I am a currently incoming freshmen with an intrested of acting. More specifically voice acting. For the people are currently take this major, how are the classes? Does CSLA, has a good acting prgram?, What are the classes like. Most importantly question, how often do the students actually go and do interactive assignments or activities. Meaning do you go and do hands on worth or yall just sit there most of the time? Most importantly and final question, is it worth taking the class here or should i look at a different cal state like cslb?",

            "comment": "hey there!\n\nI'm one of the candidates for MFA in the acting cohort in my first year. The MFA is a 3 year masters program that prepares you for a a career in Television, Film and Theatre. It will give you skills beyond what any other MFA acting program will give you as some of the classes you have to take are writing and content creation focused. This is different than the undergrad degree in theatre - acting which requires you to take more theatre classes. The MFA program only takes in new students every other year, so next intake will be for fall 2024, and after that the next one will be in 2026.   \n\n\nI personally love the classes. They are small. We are currently 6 acting students plus 2 writing students doing acting 2. We get assigned monologues and scenes, which we work on in our own time for about 3-4 weeks before we move on to the next assignment. We have to journal our process, and we have to write character bios, and summaries of the plays. There is a lot of reading involved. You have to read the play you are performing the scene or the monologue from. Last semester we had to read Uta Hagen's Respect for acting, and The Actor and The Target. These books were discussed a lot in class, and we do the activities from the books in class and without reading the book you'd be really confused.  Apart from the acting studio, each semester you do either a voice class or a movement class. The voice teacher is a trained opera singer, so you're in great hands if you wanna do voice acting! For voice and movement classes we also mostly do practical stuff, but there is also a lot of reading involved. so your movement/voice and acting classes only make up half of your classes in a week. The other classes are playwriting, theoretical classes about film and theatre, teaching seminars, TV production classes etc. Again this is a degree for those that want to be an actor with skills in directing, writing and producing things too, as well as teaching.   \n\n\nCSULB doesn't have an MFA program. They do have undergrad though. If you're a freshman I'm guessing you're coming with a high school diploma. Then you need to first do a undergrad degree before you can apply for the MFA program at Cal State LA. As for the undergrad acting major at Cal State LA. They have the same professors, but the classes are much bigger around 20 students. But it's still a great acting program.   \n\n\nThere are also heaps of theatre productions and student films made here, so you can have plenty of material for your reel etc.   \n\n\nFeel free to message me if you have any further questions.  \n\n\nGood luck!",

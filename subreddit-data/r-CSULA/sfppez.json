She allowed me to join and mentioned she spoke with the chair for special approval. She said I needed to work with them at this point.  When I spoke with the chair he said I can register on my portal. \n\nI don't see the option to register on my portal. It just tells \n\n\"You are currently #1 on waitlist\". There's no place for me add a code. or register. \n\nI'm used to an add code like how community colleges do waitlists. HELP! PLEASE!",

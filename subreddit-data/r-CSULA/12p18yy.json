    "postText": "If I declined both subsidized and unsubsidized Nursing Loans on GET, would I still need to complete a student loan entrance interview counseling session with the Student Loan Services? \n\nIf not, when should I expect the Nursing Loan Entrance Counsel and Nursing Loan Master Prom Note requirements to be taken off of my To Do list?\n\nEdit: Financial Aid office said that since I already denied it, I won\u2019t have to make an appointment for a counseling session. However, the Entrance Counsel and Master Prom Note will stay on my To Do List (it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s bad, it just won\u2019t get disbursed).",

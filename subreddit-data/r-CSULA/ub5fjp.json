I am a student at CSUN and I am trying to get this survey around as I feel like there is very little research done on First-Generation College Students who come from divorced families. If you would like to participate please read the description below: \n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nI am currently doing a survey for my Senior Project on the Success Rate of First-Generation College Students who come from Divorced families versus First-Generation College Students who come from the family's not touched by Divorce. This project is due on May 3rd and while I'm cutting it a bit close I was sure that I would be able to find research but there is very little on this niche group of individuals like me. Please answer the survey in its entirety and feel free to send the link to others that you know or other people who are attending different universities. Thank you for your responses and time!\n\n[https://forms.gle/5fzmZczvjmq8dbtq8](https://forms.gle/5fzmZczvjmq8dbtq8)",

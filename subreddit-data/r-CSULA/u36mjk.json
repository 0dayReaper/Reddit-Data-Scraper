If you are, was financial aid able to cover for it?\n\nI decided on a minor in my 2nd sem and it requires me to stay a 3rd year. I wanted to reach financial aid but it seems like no appointments are available.",

If your EFC is 0, you'll be getting all of your financial aid which will apply to your school fees such as attendence, classes, etc. My financial aid was able to cover the expenses since I had EFC score of 0. Should be the same in your case if that's what you also have",

            "comment": "If you're an incoming freshman look up the following verbage in the website and it'll give you a sheet based off of your major with all the courses you need to take. For example \"Political Science 4 year road map\". If you're a transfer then you'd look for the 2 year road map. I went based off of this and enrolled into my courses then met with an Advisor who reviewed my courses and basically said I'd chosen the correct classes.. There should also be a download of GE courses that you can take to fulfill the three GE areas needed..",

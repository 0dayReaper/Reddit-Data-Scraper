I was reading some paperwork about being very specific on how you spend it and that you can get in trouble for spending it on certain things. I was just thinking about using it on gas to drive around (the internship requires it) since my internship is close by and doesn\u2019t really require any expenses, is this allowed? Or what can I spend it on?",

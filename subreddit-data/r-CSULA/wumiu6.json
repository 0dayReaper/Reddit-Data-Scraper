I\u2019m a trans guy and I know that I look fully like a man and nobody would second guess me walking into the mens bathroom but it\u2019s just something I am terrified to do invade I\u2019m somehow spotted as a trans person. So I don\u2019t wanna have to deal with any awkwardness or maybe violence so please help a guy out and lmk which buildings have the gender neutral bathrooms if there is any \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

    "postText": "Recently I read something about how there is a point system for admissions and I may have a better chance of being accepted if I pick a major that is less popular at the school. I want to major in marketing and I would be an out-of-state student. My 9th and 10th grade year I didn't have the best grades but I passed my classes. My 11th grade year I kicked things into gear and got straight As for my first semester. Up until my 11th grade second semester, I had only taken regular classes. My second semester I took two honors courses and made an A and a B. My other two regulars were As. I'm entering 12th grade this year and will be taking 4 college courses, 3 APs, two honors, and one regular. What else can I do to boost my chances of getting into CSULA? Is marketing a popular major there? Thanks in advanced :)",

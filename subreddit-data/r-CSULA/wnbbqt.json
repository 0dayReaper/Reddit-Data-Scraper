    "postText": "hey everyone im currently starting my fall semester at CSUF. i kinda regret choosing that school because housing is really expensive, only choose it bc of the sociology program there. What would you guys do? I live 13 mins away from CSULA with no traffic and 25 with traffic. i can also take the bus which is convinient. how is the sociology program there? i kinda wanna transfer out to CSULA for spring semester. fullerton is just too far especially since i cant really drive and since it is in Orange county, no buses drop me off near the school ( i live in LA county).",

Csula is definitely not a bad school but you have to really go out of your way to find good professors as they can be scarce at times. But honestly with this economy finding a more budget friendly campus should be a priority. I'm an English major and Japanese minor student who's interested in becoming an academic advisor, it's been a good school for my needs.",

I was a Sociology major at CSUF and loved it; the professors were great and the campus is beautiful, but at the end of the day if you're closer to CSULA that might logistically make more sense and offer you more free time.",

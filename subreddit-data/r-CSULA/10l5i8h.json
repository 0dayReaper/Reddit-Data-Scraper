    "postText": "I'm kinda confused as to how parking lot B works. I've only parked in lot C before and its parking is very specific on where you can park as a student w a semester pass.\n\nFor parking lot B, can you park on either level 1 or 2 as a student w the parking pass? Or only specific areas.\n\nThank you!",

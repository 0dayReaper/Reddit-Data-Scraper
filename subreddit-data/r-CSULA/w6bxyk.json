    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am looking to transfer to CSULA in spring \u201823. I am curious as to any previous graduates/current students input on how the classes and job prospects look like. I don\u2019t know what elective courses I would take to better my chances at a data analyst or cyber security position. I know I don\u2019t want to do computer science (horrible at math) \n\nI should note that another school if interest is UC Riverside. Although the commute to riverside would be a pain as opposed to a 15 minute drive to CSULA.",

            "comment": "Hopefully, I'm not too late but I would say it\u2019s okay at best in both prospects. I\u2019m close to graduating this Fall as a CIS undergraduate.\n\nFor the data analyst role, I would say **CIS 3200**, **CIS 4150**, **CIS 4200**, and **CIS 4870**. Please do note that some of the courses listed will not be available every semester. Some will be available every semester. Some will be available every Fall or Spring semester. Some will be taught by only one specific professor. On a side note, I heard that CIS 3200 might force you to use Python.\n\nFor the cyber security role, I would say **CIS 4370**, **CIS 4730**, and **CIS 4880**. All of these electives are available every semester.\n\n\\------------------------\n\nCSULA is a commuter school so people are there to go to class and go home (or work). But still, the people there are friendly. Besides that, there is a mix of bad and good professors in all majors. Some professors are friendly, knowledgeable in their field, organized, etc. Meanwhile, some professors may act friendly but they will be rude outside of class and they may lack the skills to teach even after years of teaching. Overall, new and old professors.\n\nAs for the CIS program itself, it\u2019s okay at best. The roster for CIS electives feels limited as some of those electives are no longer taught. Plan ahead, make use of Coursicle, RateMyProfessor, and if possible, schedule an appointment with an advisor! Also, take my word with a tiny bit of salt as the majority of my experience with the CIS program has been mostly online until Fall 2021. Some CIS courses had physical labs or hands-on demos but they were dropped because of the online setting. With that being said, I recommend searching up \u201cCSULA CIS reddit\u201d on Google or \u201cCIS major\u201d related terms on this r/CSULA 's search bar because some people have asked about CSULA\u2019s CIS program and its campus before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I should note that another school if interest is UC Riverside\n\nIn regards to UC Riverside, you could try and ask r/ucr or find &amp; contact someone that is a current/ former CIS student there because I can't seem to find anyone asking about the CIS program there.\n\nP.S. If you're leaning more towards CSULA, I recommend checking out the degree program worksheets containing IS and IT options they offer to CIS students. Links to them can be found below. Anyways, if you have any questions, feel free to ask. Hopefully I answered your question :)\n\n[https://www.calstatela.edu/business/advisement/academic-information](https://www.calstatela.edu/business/advisement/academic-information) (Source)\n\n[https://www.calstatela.edu/sites/default/files/groups/CBE%20Undergraduate%20Advisement/WorksheetPDF/2019\\_sem\\_bscis\\_information\\_systems.pdf](https://www.calstatela.edu/sites/default/files/groups/CBE%20Undergraduate%20Advisement/WorksheetPDF/2019_sem_bscis_information_systems.pdf)  (IS option)\n\n[https://www.calstatela.edu/sites/default/files/groups/CBE%20Undergraduate%20Advisement/WorksheetPDF/2019\\_sem\\_bscis\\_information\\_technology.pdf](https://www.calstatela.edu/sites/default/files/groups/CBE%20Undergraduate%20Advisement/WorksheetPDF/2019_sem_bscis_information_technology.pdf)  (IT option)",

                            "comment": "To be honest, I feel somewhat confident in what CSULA taught me as well as my ability to get a job. There is almost always a project for every upper division/ elective, and the experience gained from those projects acts as a crutch if you lack experience in the field.\n\nAlso, I recommend you look up the requirements of the jobs you're interested in. See what's preferred and what's not. Some jobs require/ prefer the experience of using R and Excel in the role of data analytics. Some require/ prefer the experience of using Tableau or SQL. Because if you can't find an internship for the summer, you can always try to expand your skillset through personal projects/ experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;did you do internships?\n\nSadly no. I was searching for one since last Fall. However, after applying to dozens and going to a handful number of interviews, I just couldn't get the offer. For now, I am still looking for one but as each day passes by, I may apply to jobs w/o an internship.\n\n**EDIT:** I forgot to mention that if you can't come up with a personal project involving Excel, Tableau, Nmap, or you're lost in where to start. CSULA does provide free access to LinkedIn courses that introduce you to them. Not useful when showing to employers but it does highlight that you used them before through personal experience.",

            "comment": "Hey, I\u2019m a recent graduate at CSULA. The CIS courses are pretty straightforward and will require several group projects depending on which professor you get/classes you take. Most of them will prepare you for hardware/software but with a few data analyst, healthcare, or cyber security courses offered. Depending on which option you take, there is the Information Technology or Information Systems option. I personally recommend taking classes that\u2019s offered by Professor Fu, Balan, Pantaleon, or Sultan.\n\n  \n  \nAfter graduation, I got hired as a Systems Administrator at UCLA so take what you will from this. It\u2019ll be a matter of selling yourself after you graduate and I wish you luck!",

    "postText": "So I was registered for CS 2445-03 and I just got an email a couple days ago saying that they couldn't find an instructor to teach the class so the whole class was dropped. I signed up for a poli-sci class just to keep my credits at full time. The poli-sci class is in the same time block as the class that was dropped. I was also able to get myself into the waitlist for CS2445-01 which is also set for the same timeblock as the poli-sci class. I am currently on waitlist spot #3. It's my first semester at CSULA and was wondering what my chances are for actually getting into the class and how waitlists work?   \nWould I need to show up in person on first day even if I don't get into the class by then?   \nWould they let me know if I got into the class?   \nIf I get off the waitlist, would being in the pol-sci class in that same time block prevent me from being added to the class? So I would then have to drop the poli-sci class and hope for the best that I would get off the waitlist.",

If you're #3 in the wait list, your chances of getting in would be pretty good especially if people start dropping before the semester starts or if they don't show up on the first day.\n\n\n2. Definitely show up to the class on the first day and let the professor know that you're #3 on the wait list, if you haven't moved up yet.\n\n\n3. If you got off the wait list before the semester starts, you'll receive an email to your CSULA email letting you know you're enrolled in the class off of the wait list.\n\n\n4. If the time frame for the Poli Sci and the CS class are the same or even overlap, then yes, you will not be able to enroll into the CS class, not even if you come off the wait list.\n\n\n5. You can always drop the Poli Sci class and see if you get off the wait list for the CS class and if it's a no go after the first day, then go to the Poli Sci class during the next meeting day and see if you can add. As a Poli Sci major, I can tell you that you'll more than likely be able to add the class after it has started, especially if it's a class that still has space.\n\n\nHopefully this information helps. Best of luck and welcome to CSULA! :)",

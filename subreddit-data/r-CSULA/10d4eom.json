Students will receive notification of appeal determination by e-mail. Students awaiting a response are \r\nresponsible for paying their tuition fees by the payment deadline specified in the Schedule of Classes in order to register for classes or\r\nto avoid being dropped from enrollment.\"\n\nThis is straight from the SAP appeal application. In regards to being dropped from your classes, do you mean dropped from classes before the semester starts or during?",

Speak to cashiers to ask if a payment plan can be established if an SAP appeal is denied and tuition needs to be paid out of pocket, or is it all at once. I am unsure if this is possible, but it can help you prepare.\n\n2. If you are forced to pay out of pocket:\n\nA. Part-time (0- 6 units) is $2,193.24\n\nB. Full-time (6.1+ units) is $3,399.24\n\nSpeak with an advisor and determine how many units you need to pass and with what grade in order to no longer be under academic probation. This will help you determine how to minimize tuition cost and possibly spread it across the 2 semesters instead of 1, which can potentially be more affordable and less taxing on you.\n\n3. If you have retaken courses and passed with a higher grade the second time, make sure to fill out the [Grade Forgiveness Request](https://www.calstatela.edu/sites/default/files/users/u90356/gradeforgiveness.pdf). This will help bring your GPA up, even if by a little bit, and in this case every little bit helps. This is not done automatically by GET, so you will need to fill out the form and turn it in.\n\nI know I'm forgetting some stuff, but having gone through this circumstance already, this is what I discovered.",

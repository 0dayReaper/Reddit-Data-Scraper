Actually going that path myself after this semester",

As of right now I am a pre computer science major and I was thinking about switching to information technology, since I heard they work more with hardware if I\u2019m correct",

I was actually a pre CS major myself before switching. So far I only have one CIS class cause I just recently switched, but I love it.\n\nI'll send you a message of the classes you can take in either path if you want",

    "postText": "Hello Golden Eagles, I am currently attending university in South Korea, and will be an exchange student in the Fall semester of 2022 at CSULA. Sooo looking forward to studying in LA.\n\nBut I'm not quite sure how to register for courses (I applied for a Marketing major) in advance - Did the registration already start, or should I wait for more? I've tried to ask about this via the exchange student department's email, but no replies still. Do I need a student portal ID, too? Please help me! And thanks in advance :)",

Then just type in your student username and password to login. \n\nThe username is just the first part of your email. If it asks for your email just put your email to login. \n\nAfter logging in it takes you to your portal and just press where it says GET. From there press student center.\n\nRight there you could either go to schedule planner or enroll to register for classes",

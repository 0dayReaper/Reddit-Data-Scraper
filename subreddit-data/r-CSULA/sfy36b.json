    "postText": "How does CSU LA compare to the other Cal States in the LA area in regard to:\n\n-social life? I'm an international exchange student looking to study here for a semester so would love to go to a socially active school.\n\n-How are the dorms here? Are any of them single rooms with private bathrooms? How many students live on campus (% wise)? Is it a commuter school?\n\n-How are the clubs here?\n\n-Food options?\n\n-How is it here on weekends? Do people generally just go home? Thinking of hiring a car, is that a good idea living on campus/in LA?\n\n-How important is it being an NCAA Division I school? In terms of its impact on frequency of sporting events + school spirit\n\n-Would you say it's a friendly school here?\n\nThanks for the help!",

Dorm life is good but not like what you see at a big school like a UC. Sports are good but again, not like what you see on TV for bigger football and basketball schools.\n\nAll the schools are in LA county (except Fullerton, some would say Orange County is the Greater LA area) but LA is so big all those schools have very different vibes.\n\nCal State LA is closest to Downtown LA and has some killer Asian and Latino food options. Long Beach is a suburb with easiest beach access. Pomona is pretty isolated and it's an agricultural school with farms and animals. Fullerton is a suburb with a growing Asian population. Northridge is in the Valley, again mostly suburb (also hot as hell).",

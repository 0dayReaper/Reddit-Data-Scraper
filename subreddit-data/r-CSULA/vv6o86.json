    "postText": "Hi, I'm now a senior in high school in North Carolina. I plan on applying to CSULA for fall 2023. Looking at the A-G requirements for admission it says I need 1 year of a visual arts. In North Carolina, our schools consider 1 year to be one semester. Will I need to take another semester of visual arts? What about my other one semester courses? Also, I received a 60 in Math 1 but CSULA requires C or better for all A-G courses. Should I try to take it again in the summer or through an online program my school may offer? Thanks.",

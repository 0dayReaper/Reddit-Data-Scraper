    "postText": "Hi there, I'm wondering if I could get any input about CSULA's Fashion and Fibers program. I've studied fashion for the last two years in San Diego. I was accepted to FIDM, but I'd like to explore some other programs and see what they have to offer. So far I haven't been to find too much about CSULA's program other than that they have one, but I heard from a third party they have some pretty good  internships. I'm also wondering if anybody can tell me when I would expect find out if I got into CSULA?",

Although cost isn\u2019t really a major thing for me, I\u2019ve considered a cheaper school if the education is more worth it.",

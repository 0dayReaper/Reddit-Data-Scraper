    "postText": "I've paid my ECD recently, and it's been bothering me because I paid it on Friday at 11 P.M. Although I got the payment in before May 1st, I'm really worried because on the CSULA website, it says that payments won't be posted to my GET student account until the following business day, in this case, May 2nd, which is after the payment date. Will they take into consideration the date I paid for the ECD or the day they received the payment?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really beating myself up over this so I'm hoping for some good news here",

I just learned that Metrolink has a program where if the train is running late by over an hour you can qualify for a $50 Uber gift card to use immediately. I would still have to pay $40+ for that route, but it's still better than making the commute and wearing out my car.",

Also thanks for your patience as I had some life shenanigans come up, so I totally forgot I made this thread until today. Since the train and dorming may not be my best options, does anyone know if any carpooling options are a thing? (At least to be able to get from campus to union station)",

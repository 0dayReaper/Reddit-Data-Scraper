Based on my current grade and the remaining points of the semester my  highest possible percentage grade would be a 65%. Would it be better to withdraw from the class ( or go through the process and se if it is accepted) or is it better to just stick with the class even though I know I\u2019m gonna fail?",

So it would not look bad if you withdraw and then retake it. \nOn the other hand, if you fail it, you can retake the class and submit a grade forgiveness form. With this form the failing grade will be replaced with the new grade, meaning your failing grade will not count towards you GPA.",

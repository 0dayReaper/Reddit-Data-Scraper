I've gotten ticketed on my way to buy a permit - I arrived, walked to the kiosk (which was kinda far away), and when I returned, I had a ticket waiting for me. And the appeal process is garbage too. I submitted a bank statement with a time stamp and everything and they didn't care.",

I usually wait in my car about 5-20 minutes because I\u2019m early. By the time I was ready to head to class, there were about 15 tickets and the guys were still going around.",

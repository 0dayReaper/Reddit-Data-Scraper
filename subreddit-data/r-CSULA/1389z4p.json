    "postText": "Hiii, I\u2019m an incoming freshman for fall 2023 and just received an email of my provisional admission today. I am confused as they only sent the email to my parents and the detail stated about the preview day which was already over. I did not receive an acceptance letter yet but got a green tick on my portal. I am aware that the deposit deadline is already over but unsure if I can still accept as I am only my aware of my admission today \ud83d\ude2d",

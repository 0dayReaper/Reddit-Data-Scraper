    "postText": "This is kind of a rant but does the school care about people who need to work to support themselves to go to school? The offered lecture times for Spring 2023 are almost all in the middle of the day for ME. \" We are ranked number one in the United States for the upward mobility of our students.\" doesn't seem to be applicable for working students as some of us can only take a limited number of classes per semester that are usually at evening/night to limit income reduction. For those who have to work to go to school, how many classes are y'all taking and how are y'all managing them?",

Money has been tight this semester but I keep telling myself I\u2019m almost there. I graduate next spring.",

The hard part is finding an evening class with a decent professor.. Depending on how many people enroll in the classes available, you might be able to petition them to add another class option though.",

It\u2019s one of my major gripes with CSULA. I\u2019m taking 5 classes right now. Fortunately, this semester, they are at 6pm with the exception of my Saturday class. But in Spring, I need 6 classes to graduate (2 of them are 1-unit classes) but most are only available in the morning. I haven\u2019t figured out yet what I\u2019m going to do since I already submitted my grad application.",

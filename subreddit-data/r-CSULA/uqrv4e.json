As long as you are graduating or graduated in fall 21, spring 22 or summer 22 your able to walk you just won't get the diploma mailed to you until your done with the classes you need to take",

I am attending May 26 2pm but it looks like I\u2019m going to have to retake a class and take it during the summer and was scared that if I re-applied to graduate that I wont be able to attend May 26, but I think I would have to call about that \ud83d\ude2d",

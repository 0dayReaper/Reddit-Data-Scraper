    "postText": "hello!! im an incoming freshman for pre nursing. today i attended the preview day and what caught my eye was honors college. considering all the workload i\u2019ll have for pre nursing, is it worth applying for honors college?? also in terms of difficulty, how hard are the classes compared to a regular class?? (off topic but any pre nursing majors wanna be friends?\ud83d\ude04)",

    "postText": "I understand the situation about the disbursement potentially being in March and/or later. But, I'm confused about why GET is showing contradicting information... \n\nIn the general view for financial aid for the year 2022-2023, it says that I've accepted the **total** amount of MCS. But when I scroll down into the descriptions for each semester, it shows that I've accepted the *fall* semester (half of the total amount), and 0 for the *spring* semester. Yet, when I click on disbursement dates for each semester, it shows the total amount (halved for each semester) and when it *should* have been disbursed. \n\nSo, does that mean I'm only getting 1 semester's worth? Both semesters' worth? Are they coming at the same time? At different times? \n\n\\*I've been contacting my financial aid advisor and they've been very vague about answering these questions, so I'm hoping other people will have some answers!",

This is what was told to me when I called the Financial aid office on Friday. The first batch of disbursements should be going out this coming up Friday, March 3rd and every Friday after in March. So based off of the number of Fridays in March, I'm assuming Friday the 3rd and 10th would be Fall disbursements and Friday the 17th and 24th would be Spring disbursements.\n\nEdit to Add: My GET is also showing 0 for Spring but then when I click on the disbursement information it shows an amount. When the GET system went down about a week or 2 ago, it seems like it never fixed completely so it's still acting up. Whatever amount shows when you click on the disbursement link should be the amount you'll be receiving but also keep in mind that the amount is dependent on the number of units you took for the semester it's attached too. My amount for Fall was higher and then it changed to the current amount I will actually be receiving and I was told that was due to the amount of units I took for Fall. They haven't check units for Spring yet so the amount currently showing might change.",

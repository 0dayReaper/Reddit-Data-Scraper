    "postText": "Looking for summer housing\n\nHi all,\nI'm looking for a sublease for all of July and August. Looking for housing on transit lines connected to the Children's Courthouse in Monterey Park area. Very unfamiliar with LA so any advice on which neighborhoods to be looking at would also be appreciated. \n\nAbout me: I just finished my first year of law school here at the University of Minnesota. Before that, I taught middle school English for two years. I love good books, coffee, losing in chess, and quirky movies. I've got seven siblings, so I'm used to living with lots of folks, and currently live with 11 housemates up here. \n\nThank you in advance! Really struggling out here to find housing so I appreciate any advice or help.\n\nAlso if anyone has ideas on renting a bike or buying a cheap bike for two months I\u2019d greatly appreciate that too.",

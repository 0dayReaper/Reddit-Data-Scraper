Some students who applied for other graduate programs must have heard something by now. Their application deadlines were a lot earlier than that of Sociology (Jan/Feb vs April).\n\nAnyway, I wish you acceptance to the grad program you want.",

I'd never use the word 'slapdick' on a uni campus, if it makes you feel better.",

So even if you are a loser with no social life, u my friend, serve as testament that anybody can do it.",

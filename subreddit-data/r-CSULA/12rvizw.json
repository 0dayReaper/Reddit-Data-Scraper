    "postText": "I spoke to a financial aid advisor yesterday and was told that those who haven\u2019t received it yet,  is because they have to make cap space because it goes over your EFC. So they have to lower a prior loan etc in the system in order for it to accept it disbursing over the limit. This is for people whose hold says \u201creview or OVRAWARD\u201d they have no actual timeline and are hoping to get them out by end of this semester, but he also reiterated that they may have to extend into summer while disbursing because it\u2019s so many. \n\nHopefully this info helps. When you call on the phone they can\u2019t give you as much in depth info. You have to see an advisor in person for them to let you know specifically about your aid.",

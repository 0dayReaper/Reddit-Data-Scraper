    "postText": "Hello everyone! I'm Christine Figueroa. I am a part of an organization called **Step Up Tutoring**. The program was created amidst the pandemic to provide free mentor and tutoring services to children in LAUSD, particularly in communities that are underserviced. Currently, we have a waiting list for students that need tutoring. We are in need of motivated college students who are interested in helping our local youth during these traumatic times. The minimum commitment for the program is 2 45-minute tutoring sessions per week. These could be scheduled at your convenience with the student's family. The organization is able to provide paperwork to verify service hours. Feel free to check out our website for more information. [https://www.stepuptutoring.org/](https://www.stepuptutoring.org/) . We look forward to hearing from you! #stepuptutoring \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uz8bwanch5k71.png?width=3235&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1b102849020a9be7d95c98043bbcc70d135d110a",

Adjusting your schedule after the last day to add requires additional approvals and payment of a $25 late submission fee. Drops after this date also require approvals and will result in a W-grade posted to your official record. The\u00a0Records &amp; Enrollment\u00a0web page is your resource for registration information and forms.\"\n\nThat was sent out by email",

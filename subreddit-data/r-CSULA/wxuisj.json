So YDSA is a national organization whose primary goal is to empower the working class by making our learning institutions democratic, equitable, and accessible to all. There are chapters at colleges and high schools all over the country, and they do things like labor organizing, mutual aid, campaigns to improve conditions for students, and more! At CSULA specifically, we could potentially do things like organizing to raise the wages of student workers, or campaigning for progressive/socialist candidates for local office. When we hold our first meeting, we\u2019ll hear from attendees what issues are important to them and vote on what issues we want to tackle. YDSA is a democratic organization, so the wants and needs of our members will mostly shape what our chapter ends up doing. I hope this answer was helpful!",

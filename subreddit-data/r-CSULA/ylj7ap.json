    "postText": " Will  Lehman, who is a socialist and a 2nd tier Mack Truck worker in PA, is  running for president of the UAW.    This Sunday at 11 am   PST,  he  will be holding an online rallly where he will be discussing  his  platform which is to provide for what grad  students need and not what  management says that they can afford.   Grad students should have  already started to  receive their ballots in the mail for this historic    election, which is taking  place as the result of the incarceration of  most of the previous leadership on charges of corruption and accepting  bribes in return for  sweetheart deals.  Will is running to put an end    to these sweetheart deals and putting the union and it's assets back   under the control of the rank and file members. Register here: [https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/7616674020496/WN\\_2ysgIxgHRimGLPVfQkwrhA](https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/7616674020496/WN_2ysgIxgHRimGLPVfQkwrhA) to attend.\n\nIf  you would like to volunteer to help in the final stages of the  campaign, or just to find out more about Will's campaign, or to watch  the debate between Will and the well paid bureaucrats, you can do so     here:  [https://www.willforuawpresident.org/](https://www.willforuawpresident.org/)",

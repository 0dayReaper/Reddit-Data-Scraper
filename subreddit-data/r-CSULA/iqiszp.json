White announced that the 23 campuses of the CSU will continue virtual instruction in the spring of 2021. Before making this decision, the chancellor spoke with presidents and other stakeholders. We all agree that the health and safety of students, faculty, and staff is paramount. Providing virtual instruction will enable our students to continue to make progress toward their degrees. \u00a0\n\nI join with Chancellor White in thanking our students, faculty, and staff for working together to continue the mission of the university during these difficult times. We will provide additional information as it becomes available.\u00a0\n\n[https://www2.calstate.edu/csu-system/news/Documents/Chancellor%20message%20on%20Spring%202020.pdf](https://www2.calstate.edu/csu-system/news/Documents/Chancellor%20message%20on%20Spring%202020.pdf)\n\nSincerely,\u00a0\n\nWilliam A. Covino\u00a0\n\nPresident\u00a0",

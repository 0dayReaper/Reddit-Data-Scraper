My friends at csulb and csun have a cool rec. center too. Like an actual building and not a few rooms in the basement. Who feels the same?",

I didn't get a tour prior to signing on because I made my decision based on logistics and convenience, but I kinda regret not going to Poly Pomona or CSUN. I really expected a bit more.",

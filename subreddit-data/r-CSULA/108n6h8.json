    "postText": "Goes by the name of Phillip Thomas. I've seen the flurry of reviews claiming he is absolutely not worth taking. However, I'm tossed between taking his CIS 4100 class at 1:40pm (which works better for my schedule) vs. a night class taught by Daniel Razmjou who seems like a decent professor. I'm curious if anyone has taken this professor, from a non-biased perspective is Thomas really that bad?",

Took him for 4200 during Fall 2021, and he expects you to learn everything by yourself. \n\n\n1) Never lectures or teaches anything related to the course; just random concepts/ offers on AWS courses.\n2) The assigned Perusall readings have little to no relevance in the exams; only the textbook. Although, the textbook was never mentioned in any of the lectures.\n3) The assignments and project have little to no description. You will need to figure out on your own on what is wanted for that assignment/ project.",

            "comment": "When enrolling late, you should get the name of the professor from GET and search their name and the department that the class is offered from on the CSULA website to find their email. Email them straight away to inform them your intent to add. That way the professor knows about your late enrollment, how you'll need more time to get caught up in the class, and since you won't be able to see Canvas until later the professor can tell you what assignments are due so you can get a head start. You should always come to the class you intend to add, whether you're enrolled yet or not. This way you can get a feel for whether you actually want to be in the course or not, and the professor is aware of you. Plus you can be up to date on what's happening in the class. Just get the classroom building/number and day/time of the meeting hour from GET. Now you know how to go about it for next time.",

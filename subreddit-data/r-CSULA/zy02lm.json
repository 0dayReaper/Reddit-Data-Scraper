I paid my fees and I remember explicitly enrolling for the class. \n\nI just logged into GET to check my schedule and my enrolled class lost is empty for Winter 2023. I never received an email or notification informing me that the class was cancelled, nor did I receive a refund for Winter fees. I\u2019m fuming right now.\nWho should I speak to in regards to this fuck up? \nI swear this school keeps gifting me with reasons to hate it and regret my decision to attend. \n\nP.S. \nfuck parking services too!\nTheir stupid website to pay online isn\u2019t even functioning.",

However, there are a high number of applicants relative to the number of candidates we can admit.  We very much appreciate your interest in our MSW program and hope you remain interested.\n\n regarding interviews, it stated: As the spaces available may be limited, applicants on the waitlist may be invited to come in for an interview with the admissions review committee.\n\nhope that helps!! fingers crossed!",

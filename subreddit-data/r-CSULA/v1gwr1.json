(Log on to GET and look at the left column, scrolling down a bit) and if there is still nothing. That's not on you. That's on the professor. Just send them an email from your campus email. If you know their name, when you compose an email on the campus one if you write the name, their email gets autocompleted even if you only write the name down. So you SHOULD be able to contact them. Just let them know that you don't see anything on canvas and haven't received anything. Sometimes many professors do it the night before and canvas serves crash or something.",

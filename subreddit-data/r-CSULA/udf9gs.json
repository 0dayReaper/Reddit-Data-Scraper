            "comment": "I would recommend a few things.   \n1. Look at the specific tracks that interest you and see what those classes are (look up their course descriptions). You may find one has specific course opportunities you like over the other. Also, some might assume that UCs will be more theory based, but you can check out the actual offerings for the tracks available for your major. A \"track\" is basically a preplanned paths for a major; some majors at some universities require you follow a track, others simply recommend them, and others do not have tracks but just general course area requirements. A cursory glance shows that UCR has the following tracks: TRACK 1: LITERATURE, HISTORY, CRITICISM, AND DRAMATURGY; TRACK 2: WRITING FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS; TRACK 3: FILM MAKING; TRACK 4: ACTING AND DIRECTING; TRACK 5: PRODUCTION AND DESIGN. While I could not easily find \"tracks\" for CSULA's program, but they also seem to have a good mix of production, writing, tech, and theory courses that you could choose from. It seems like either could be serviceable and may warrant an hour's time to search through both in a deep consideration of each university's offerings now that you are at this final stage in decision making. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n2. Look up the faculty that teach the undergraduate courses. I will say that UCR will rely more on graduate students teaching lower-division courses (classes aimed at Freshmen and Sophomores) than CSULA due to differences in the purpose and structure of each university. CSUs are teaching centered, UCs are research centered. Tenured and tenure-track faculty at CSUs tend to teach 2-4 undergraduate classes per semester while tenured or tenure-track  faculty at UCs tend to teach at most 1-2 undergraduate courses per semester, but sometimes teach none due to graduate teaching and research requirements. While some graduate students can be amazing (and you still might have a few MA students teaching a few intro classes at a CSU), and while some faculty can be piss-poor educators, you might want see how much faculty/grad teaching occurs in your major and think about how that might impact your comfort with either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n3. Consider the areas: going to a university is a big multi-year commitment to a geographic region. Riverside is not as exciting as LA (although still not too long of a drive from more exciting places), but LA is a lot more expensive. While the public transit is better in LA, you can feasibly live in a less-expensive area in the lower desert in California (like the Desert Hot Springs areas) and take busses or commute to school just as easily. If you go to CSULA, expect living costs to be much higher in exchange for the buzzing area and public transport convenience. I would also recommend not bringing a car at all to LA (traffic is terrible, parking is difficult to find in many areas and expensive, and despite some people's complaints, the metro system is relatively safe, reliable, and very affordable). I've spent many years in both LA County and Riverside/San Bernardino Counties, and they each have their pros and cons. If you want to talk more about the specifics of either area more in-depth, feel free to message me and I can give you my perspective as a person who did undergrad and grad in those regions without having access to a car the entire time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. Consider your support system. If you have family, friends, etc., closer to one area than another, or could even live with family if you went to one over the other, make that a big part of your consideration. College life can be hard, and having trustworthy people close by can be a literal and figurative life-saver.",

I looked into the tracks at both schools and I do believe UCR has more production courses which is where I would like to focus. I did a little research on the professors but wasn\u2019t aware of the grad students teaching situation so I will have to look into that more. As for as transportation I would either have to drive or maybe take a train. I\u2019m living in chino hills and that is where I will be for my junior year at least.",

I went to LMU undergrad and CSULA MA, but my undergrad friends at the film school at LMU (one of the most underrated and great film schools around) had jobs lined up already because they had great faculty mentoring and alumni networking options. Not sure if UCR offers that, but CSULA gives you the option of being closer to the industry. It really depends on if you want to have a practical university experience or a theoretical one. UCR is definitely more theoretical in terms of artistic craft per a friend who did his PhD out there in music theory and had friends who studied film and other fine arts.",

But reach out to the film department to see where they have placed grads or talk to alumni relations to see if they have networking events. I speak from the perspective of someone who went to undergrad years ago, had a career, and then switched careers so went back to get an MA in something else. So I can tell you what works long term planning with job prospects. The \u201cwhat I wish I knew when I was an undergrad\u201d advice.",

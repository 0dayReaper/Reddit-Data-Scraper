    "postText": "Hello, I am going to be off-campus for all my classes in the fall except for one day a week. They are all directed study and online except for that one day where I will need to be on campus for like six hours. I know there is an eight hour option for daily parking but I wanted to see if I could avoid that too. So, my question: I noticed that when I leave the parking structures, and before I get to the freeway entrance, there are small streets around campus. I was wondering if anyone knew what the situation is with those little side streets? No time limit? Safety? etc...Thanks in advance!",

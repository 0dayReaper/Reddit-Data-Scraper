    "postText": "Hey everyone since classes are going to be online for the first 3 weeks, I wanted to bring awareness about the fraternity I am currently in. From personal experience it has helped me with networking with other students, building relationships and has brought me closer to the school. Overall this greek experience has made me an active member in my community. I wanted to let everyone know that we are rushing this spring semester, and we would love to see new active members, if anyone is interested or would want additional information. Please respond to the discussion forum. Or message me on Instagram _oscarrrx",

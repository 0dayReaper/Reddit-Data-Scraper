    "postText": "Hey all. I am starting at CSULA in the fall (upper-division transfer student) and I\u2019m trying to get myself ready. Tomorrow is my orientation. I probably should\u2019ve started thinking about this sooner, but I do not feel ready to be a full-time student this semester and need to communicate this to the school. I have been in the hospital for psychiatric reasons this spring and summer, and am in a program currently (that ends before school starts) to help with my issues. It\u2019s going extremely well, but I\u2019m not quite ready to commit to a full load. I\u2019ll also be commuting about 40 miles until my family feels that I am ready to move out on their dime (fair). \n\nI am not seeing a lot of info on part-time enrollment anywhere on the university\u2019s website. Does anyone know anything at all about part-time enrollment? Of course I am going to speak to my counselor about it tomorrow, but I\u2019d like to come prepared. Oops. \n\nThanks everyone, take care.\n\nEDIT: You can enroll part-time! I just signed up for two classes for the fall semester. Neat!",

They're usually pretty easy\n\nI'm not sure how to enroll as a part time student but I know if you do it does affect your financial aid if you have some.",

I chose it years ago at the community college level and can\u2019t switch it to anything else now, but that\u2019s okay, I like studying it. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do for work after college if I finish but it\u2019s definitely fun for me. That\u2019s good to know about the online classes!",

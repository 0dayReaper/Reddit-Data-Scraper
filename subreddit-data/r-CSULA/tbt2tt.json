Some people receive a Pell Grant and a Cal Grant; others receive a Pell Grant and a State University Grant.. So the amount you receive after your tuition and fees have been deducted varies..",

You would click on the financial aid link and it'll take you to a page where it'll show you the full amount you'd get for the whole academic year if full time and what you'd get for each semester if full time.. Just remember you'd have to deduct tuition and fees from the full semester amount..",

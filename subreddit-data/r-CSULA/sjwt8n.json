I have to now find people to take my survey and I've tried my own social media and still only have one response. If anyone can take 5-10 minutes to finish the survey that would be awesome! I really need to finish this class ASAP so I can graduate.\n\nIt is anonymous and on Mental Health Literacy and Awareness.

Do I need to submit my transcript twice, once right now and another around the summer? Or do I just submit it right now and forget about the July 15 deadline?",

Once right now so that they can confirm the information you provided in the CSU Apply website which allowed them to grant you conditional admission. And then you'll provide your final transcripts once your semester is done and your grades have been posted.",

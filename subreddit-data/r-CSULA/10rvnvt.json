    "postText": "Everyone wants to go home after class, we don\u2019t do anything about the lack or resources and our graduation being in the parking lot, zero school spirit, most students don\u2019t have ambition and just want to graduate, limited professors / classes. \n\nNothing about this school is good other than the cost. Even if it\u2019s cheap, I regret coming here. If you\u2019re thinking about it don\u2019t do it. This school is slowly turning into a community college",

My friends and I would get hammered and have an blast after school in DTLA especially since there\u2019s buses directly to there. If you really don\u2019t like it then transfer my guy. It\u2019s all about the friends you make",

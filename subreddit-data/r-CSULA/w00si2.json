    "postText": "I'm applying for housing and have finished my application some time ago but l am not sure about the TB risk assessment requirement. I have yet to submit a risk assessment form because I could not find what it is they wanted me to send. The one link I could find wasn't working. I did, however, fill out the TB Screen Test - Housing form on the Student Health Portal page. I wanted to know if that was sufficient, and, if not, what else would I have to do and how to go about doing it. If I cannot fulfil this by the 22nd, would I be denied housing? Do I have to fill out all the other sections in the Clearances and Forms page even though I could not find anything that said filling them out was mandatory either for housing or enrollment?",

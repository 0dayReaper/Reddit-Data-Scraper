I did receive a confirmation for my application when I submitted it. I did already email them twice this week so just wanted to reach out to see if anybody is in a similar spot. \n\nOn a side note, if you did get accepted this year, what were your stats (Teas score, gpa, and any additional points)?",

This is my 2nd year applying and there's no transparency. They don't tell you what score you had on your application and what score you needed to get in so you have no idea how close your were to making it. Both years they told me \" you had a competitive application but did not get accepted\" or something along those lines. When I asked for further information, they responded with very vague answers. \n\nCSULA ABSN program has no transparency. Some schools like CSU Chico post the scores of the accepted applications and tell you how you ranked against other applicants. The  coordinators probably can be selective in who they want to accept into the program. It sounds like entry into the program is decided subjectively rather than objectively.",

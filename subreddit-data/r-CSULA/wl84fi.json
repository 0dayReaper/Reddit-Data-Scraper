    "postText": "Hey fellow commuters, just a quick PSA that there is the Metrolink train and Foothill Silver Streak Bus that take you directly to campus. I commute everyday to campus via Metrolink and I have to say it\u2019s actually very relaxing, cost efficient, and reliable. If you\u2019re from the east side of LA, I would highly recommend you look into the nearest station that services the Metrolink San Bernardino line or foothill silver streak bus. I\u2019m not affiliated with these companies but I am a public transit advocate. There\u2019s so many train lines that connect to union station where you could get to school pretty easily, as well. So look into it, or ask me below.\n\nI\u2019ll be monitoring comments to answer questions!",

There\u2019s only 1 connection you\u2019d have to make after getting off the train.\n\nTake the Metrolink Orange County Line to Union Station (this is the end of the line). From there you have a few options. You could take a Metro Local line such as the 106 line. Or what I do is take the Silver Streak Bus or J silver line Metro Bus any one works. It\u2019s only 2 bus stops because they are freeway lines. \n\nVisit Metrolink.com to find an Orange County station and the Orange County line train schedule. I honestly would do that if I lived there. That\u2019s a far drive with lots of traffic! Did that help? I can clarify anything questions.",

Brief stops\u2026 but there\u2019s a good amount. The transit app will tell you which station is closest to you and how to get to it. Ideally if you have a car/bike/electric scooter you can go travel to the station on your own means without taking a bus. I would recommend bike, as Metrolink allows bikes in their cars",

    "postText": "I was wondering does KTH offer any studies for working adults? \n\nI have masters degree in electronics from not so well known EU univeristy but for the last 6 years I have been working as software engineer.\n\nI saw that KTH has some very cool masters for programming and I am flirting with the idea of joining.\n\nIs this possible, working and going to college? If it is, how could I apply and what would the requierments be?\n\nI am already located and working in Stockholm so that is not a problem. Paying some tution would also be okay.\n\nThanks in advance",

You have 7 years from when you start the course to finish, the amount you study is entirely up to you.\n\nSpeak with your company, they may give you incentives to study, time off for exams, etc.\n\nEdit: apply the usual way, through universityadmissions.se",

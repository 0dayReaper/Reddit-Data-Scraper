            "comment": "In the first round you needed a merit score of 21.88. It is propbably going to be a bit lower though. You can calculate your Merit score on the universityadmissions website, or just wait until they do it for you. If you want to know your score, don't forget to add the \"merit point compensation\".\n\nFor example, to get in in Germany, you would have needed an Abitur final grade of 1,2 or better to get in. \n\n\nHere you can find how many points you can get. Just click on your country.\nhttps://www.antagning.se/sv/betyg-och-behorighet/utlandsk-gymnasieutbildning/sa-har-raknas-betygen-om/\n\nAnd on the bottom of this page, you can calculate based on your preliminary merit score, how much mertit point compensation you can add to your score\n\nhttps://www.antagning.se/sv/betyg-och-behorighet/utlandsk-gymnasieutbildning/sa-har-raknas-betygen-om/",

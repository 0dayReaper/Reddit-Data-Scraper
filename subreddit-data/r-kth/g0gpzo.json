    "postText": "Hej hej! I\u2019m currently a first year student at KTH, but am considering switching to Uppsala to basically the same thing for next year. It doesn\u2019t feel very smart since that would mean starting over and adding a year to my studies, so i\u2019m definitely considering staying too. (The reason why I\u2019m considering this is because I have a hard time with Stockholm.) I would love to hear from fellow KTH students why it would be a good idea to stay etc, I would really find that input valuable! Thank you for your help :)",

From my experience:\n\n* \"KTH\" on your CV help you get the interview.\n* Many companies (including my own) target KTH specificly for internships/summer jobs.\n* Being active in \"N\u00e4ringslivsn\u00e4mnden\" and other similar groups/activities during your last years at KTH will give you a wide network of great career oppurtunities in Stockholm with minimal effort.",

I have been thinking similarly aswell and I would really like to invest in my future like that, but I\u2019m also considering how much me not feeling well in this current enviroment might influence things? Like will I be able to do 4 more years, and is it worth it to do it like that, if you know what I mean.",

May I ask what you studied? If you\u2019re comfortable of course, feel free to share in dms if you don\u2019t feel like posting it here :)",

But some pros are that it's close to things/central, so a lot of museums and stuff to visit/do. There's also a lot of clubs and stuff, unfortunately a lot is limited now regarding corona ofc so it's a bit harder to socialize in general everywhere...",

Maybe it helps if i say I\u2019m originally from Uppsala and haven\u2019t had the opportunity to move to Stockholm yet, but since i haven\u2019t loved the vibe of the city I haven\u2019t really wanted to too much either.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI have heard that the Swedish-speaking 5-year long programmes have a guaranteed spot for masters. I thus would like to ask, what role does gpa play when applying for a master's programme within civilingenj\u00f6rsutbildning? Are you just guaranteed a spot in any master's programme that  the 5-year long programme offers if you have just taken the right electives for it regardless of your gpa?",

            "comment": "To be eligible for a \"free\" spot through what you say you actually need to have been admitted to the five year programme. There are opportunities to get the free spot by applying to the second/third year depending on your prior completed university education but from my perspective, courses rarely overlap and you end up repeating a lot of classes. Ask the study advisor.  \n\n\nRegarding GPA, ask the study advisor for the relevant school - ABE, CBH etc. If you're an international student you might want to contact international admissions. With some less popular programmes you're pretty much guaranteed a spot anyway but it get's harder as you move up in popularity.",

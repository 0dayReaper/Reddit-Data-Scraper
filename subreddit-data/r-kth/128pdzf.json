    "postText": "Hello there! Like several people who write in these days I got \"reserved\" as result of my KTH application. In particular I am in the BEFR waiting list with the number 15, for the MSc in Machine Learning. I was wondering, is there any chance to have an offered place in this situation?",

This also because I got a place in Chalmers University for Data Science &amp; AI, and I didn't understand very well if It exists a deadline to drop a place offered from swedish universities.",

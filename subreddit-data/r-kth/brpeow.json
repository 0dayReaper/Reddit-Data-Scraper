    "postText": "Hi, I was placed in reserve spot 5 in the BEFR group for a masters programme. At the start the number of accepted students in my group was 24, now that number has gone down to 22, but my reserve spot number has not been updated. Does that mean I am now in reserve spot 3, or will they not be accepting more students?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny clarification would be greatly appreciated.",

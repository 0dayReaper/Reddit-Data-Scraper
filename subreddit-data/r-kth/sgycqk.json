    "postText": "I have applied for MS in Embedded Systems for 2022 admissions. KTH offers 4 Tracks to chose from, out of those 4 the Electronics and Platforms Track have similar electives to chose from. Can someone explain a bit about these 2 tracks and what electives are suggested in both of them as I am inclined towards the electronics tack and would like to select electives in computer architecture, is this advisable or should i go the other way round and select the platforms track and tke electives in electronics that i find intresting. Also how many courses will we be able to take in 2 years?",

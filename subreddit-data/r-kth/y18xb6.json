    "postText": "Hi everybody, i'm looking forward to apply to kth's bachelor ICT for the autumn 2023 semester, but I lack a specific requirement, which is a physics grade written in my documents of previous education. How can I supplement it? I know there's komvux in Sweden, but in order to apply for the course, which is given in Swedish(and that's the first stop for me), you need to move there, rent an appartment, register for your social security number and so on... it's not the first choice I would go on with. I already sent an email at the admissions office, two weeks passed and I still got no answer. Same with university admissions, they say it's up to the university to decide if the document(probably a certificate of completion of a Physics 2 course ) is valid or not. So my question is, has any of you had the same issue as mine? If not, do you guys know another workaround to get a chance to get admitted? PS. I already know there is the swedish national test, but it's in Swedish, and has to be taken in person, so it's not a valuable option atm.",

Btw, after calling kth, they told me(although they\u2019re not 100% sure given that university admissions is the one that decides if a certification is valid or not) that the gsce in physics would be a valid exam/certification(call it whatever you want) to meet the specific requirement. Can you guys confirm that? Has someone ever took the gce/gcse, even to meet other specific requirements? Also, would it add some other points to my basic points given by converting my diploma score? Because i\u2019ve seen that if you take classes at komvux(which, as far as the counselor at kth told me, they take the gce/gsce at the end of the course and they(the students) provide it as documentation during the application process) you can add points to your basic rating, can that be the case? Anyway, i will reach out to university admission this week but I\u2019d like to know if some of you can give me some information in advance, thank you all :)",

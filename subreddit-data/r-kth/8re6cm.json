    "postText": "This place seems to be somewhat dead but since weirdly enough I was not able to find an appropriate online Forum to post this to I'll post here anyways in the hope that somebody will be able to help me out.\n\nI've landed an ERASMUS exchange spot at KTH for next january (I study computer science). I'm still thinking about whether I want to go, but in any case I have already started to look at available courses. What I'd like to know is whether as an exchange student I would only be able to attend courses marked as being eligible for \"SAP\" students (which would be kind of weird since those include less than half of all courses offered). Or is that something entirely unrelated to ERASMUS? It's difficult to find out anything about that via Google since all results lead back to course sites.\nI guess I'll email a degree coordinator next week but I was hoping someone might be able to give me a quick heads up before that.",

For example, this one sound interesting but again I'm not sure if I'm eligible for it: https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2458?l=en (I am a masters level student at my home university, forgot to mention that)",

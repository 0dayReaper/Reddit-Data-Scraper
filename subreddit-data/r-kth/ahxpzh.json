    "postText": "Hey, everyone. I needed some help regarding the summary sheet for M. Sc. Aerospace.\n\nThey ask me to list the courses for Calculus, Algebra etc. Unfortunately, my courses for them are Engineering Mathematics 1 through 4. And each course contains a bit of calculus, algebra etc. Can I include them again in the next section? Or can I only include one subject once?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

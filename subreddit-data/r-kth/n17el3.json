    "postText": "Hi there!\n\nGreetings!\n\nI have received admit this year for Engineering Design Program-Machine Design at KTH. The program courses are practical and the focus is on the application and design practices rather than any theoretical science. How is your feedback of this course?\n\nAlso, I have received admit from KU leuven for MSc in Mechanical. There I want to choose Automotive electives. But what i have heard from most of the students at KUL is that the program in average and it is very much theoretical. It is about the methods of Structural design, Dynamics, NVH etc rather than focus on automotive applications. It does not cover automotive engineering in detail but cover some basic methods of structural design, dynamics and vibrations.  \n\n\nHence I am not able to decide between the two programs. The program at Ku leuven will let me study topics related to automotive domain but is not very good. However, the Engineering design program at KTH will let me study engineering design methods and some theoretical subjects like tribology but not much about automotive. It is somewhat more practical then Leuven course. However at KTH i can be able to take 2-3 electives related to automotive.  \n\n\nCan anyone comment on the above explained scenario?  \n\n\nThanks,",

Once you do, you can get CSN (if you\u2019re EU). Then, it all becomes very chill. Master\u2019s courses are 2 years here which gives you much more breathing space, time to focus on your subjects, and time to have a life.",

Usually having a part time job is enough to be eligible for that.\nI never got it myself but my girlfriend has used it throughout her education and it can come up to a very good amount monthly.",

            "comment": "Regarding the study/life balance and the question about getting a job: if you compare Swedish university with other countries like Nederlands, Germany or Italy, it def leaves way more time to the students to focus on extra curricular activities such as clubs, sports or a job.\nI had several classmates which had different kinds of jobs (full time and part time) during their Master, they all managed somehow.\nI'd say it really depends on your Master, your needs to be a successful student and how time consuming the job would be.\nIf I can give a personal suggestion: go for a part time job. It makes you eligible for CSN (monthly state money in the form of grant or loan) which gives you a lot of freedom when it comes to money and it s not as time consuming as a full time job",

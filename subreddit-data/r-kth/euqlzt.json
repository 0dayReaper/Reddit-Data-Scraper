    "postText": "Hej everyone, my wife recently received a research position at KTH so we are moving to Stockholm from Cape Town South Africa! \n\nWe're both very excited as we visted Sweden in 2017 and absolutely fell in love with the country. \n\nSo regarding my post... I have a bachelors in Industrial Engineering and would like to pursue my masters at KTH. I saw that application deadline has passed (15 Jan) but I want to know if anyone has applied after the deadline with success? \n\nI would appreciate any advice. Tack s\u00e5 mycket",

I was wondering where I could start looking for housing as I haven\u2019t been accepted yet but there is just a month between admission results come out and the start of the program so I would like to start looking now. Any recommendations of areas to rent an apartment? Student housing options? On campus housing? \n\nThanks in advance and yall have a great summer :)",

You can find the courses for the upcoming start of the bachelors program on this link: [https://www.kth.se/en/studies/bachelor/information-communication-technology/courses-1.878076](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/bachelor/information-communication-technology/courses-1.878076)\n\nI clicked on Programming I and that seems to be in Java. Computer Hardware Engineering seems to teach C language. Developing Mobile Applications from the second year teaches HTML5, CSS, Android, Javascript and SQL.\n\nI'm in the media technology M.sc program and from my view it seems languages can change from year to year, but the general knowledge taught stays the same. \n\nHope this answers your questions!",

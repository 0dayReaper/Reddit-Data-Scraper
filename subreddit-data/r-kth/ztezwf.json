            "comment": "Im not an international student so Im not sure if the following is applicable but when I first applied to KTH, Karolinska Institute and Stockholm University I got all admission results at the same time, a few weeks after deadline. This was through the swedish application portal antagning.se so if you are applying through a different channel or maybe directly to the universities it may very well differ.  \n\nMy guess is even if they start checking early, they will wait until they have went through all applications before sending replies and this will be after deadline. \"First come first serve\" is almost certainly out of the question. If you want a reliable answer I recommend you email the student counselors for the department you are applying to (for example \"School of industrial engineering and management\" if your masters programme is part of that school), they are quick and helpful at KTH but most will be on vacation now during the holidays.",

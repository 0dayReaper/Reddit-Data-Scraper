    "postText": "Hi \nI\u2019m moving to Stockholm with my boyfriend and I was wondering how to transfer to KTH for a bachelor degree. \nI sent an email, but I didn\u2019t get a clear reply..\n\nQ1. What\u2019s the minimum university GPA to get into KTH? \nQ2. What\u2019s the passing grade that I can transfer? \nFor example, in Quebec, passing grade is from A to D-. Can I transfer a course with C- to KTH?\n\nThanks in advance!",

You can read more (here)[https://www.kth.se/en/studies/bachelor/information-communication-technology/contact-1.437845]\n\nNote that our bs programmes in engineering are 3 years and give \n\nI think gpas vary from programme to programme and then t depends on if you have to enroll as a regular student or if you can enroll through your University. Who have you contacted regarding this?",

            "comment": "One way to \"transfer\" to KTH would be to apply as regular and once admitted figure out with the counselor of studies what courses you can accredited from your old university. But as others have said, 1) bs programmes tends to be in Swedish in KTH (I believe there might be some exception but not really sure) and 2) it probably be best to get straight answers from KTH.",

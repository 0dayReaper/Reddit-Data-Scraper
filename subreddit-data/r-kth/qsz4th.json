What is the scope for internship or jobs in sweden after completing that course. I am also considering Finland as an option. So which one should i go for?  \nLastly I am planning to settle in the country i complete my masters in. So what are my odds of getting an IT job after completing masters in CS from a reputed uni like KTH, Uppsala or Lund???  \nThank you :)",

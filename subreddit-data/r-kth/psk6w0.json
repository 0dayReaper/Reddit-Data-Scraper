Round 1 or Round 2?[https://www.kth.se/en/studies/bachelor/information-communication-technology/description-1.437049](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/bachelor/information-communication-technology/description-1.437049)\n2. What IB Diploma score should I get to have a good chance of getting in?\n3. I take both HL physics and math. Do I need any other specific subjects to get in?",

It is unclear if it is something temporary due to Covid or something that is going to stay. This autumn, 39 IB diploma points were required to get in.\n3. English A or English B. SL or HL, doesn't matter. You most likely have this unless you're taking IB in French or Spanish \ud83d\ude05",

    "postText": "Hey everyone. \n\nSo I\u2019m from Portugal, just finishing my BSc in Electrical Power Engineering at IST (the best engineering faculty in the country). I\u2019ve already done my application for the MSc at KTH but I\u2019m starting to doubt that I\u2019ll be accepted.\nAccording to MSc website, last years admission rate was only 15% \ud83d\ude33 (46/302 students). I have a 14/20 average, which is good but not amazing. I\u2019ve done an internship and many other extracurricular activities, and good recommendation letters.\n\nDo you thing I have a chance, and that they\u2019ll look beside my grades, or will it be one of those cases where the first selection is grades only?\n\nThanks for your opinion !\n \nP.S.: This is my Reddit post ever",

    "postText": "Hi guys, I have two questions for you.\nFirstly, I'd like to apply to MSc in computer science, but I also like their programs in  machine learning and applied and computational mathematics. So, can you tell me if I can apply for more than one program? \nSecondly, in the entry requirements, the first raw says that they evaluate the University. Does this mean that if I did my BSc in a reputable University, I will have more chances to be accepted?\n\nThank you!",

I have got some questions regarding the admission process and I would be very thankful if someone could answer them. \n\nI applied to Bachelor's Programme in ICT a few weeks ago and still haven't gotten any messages/info from the university on the admission portal. \n\nDo they respond after the admission deadline or before? \n\nHow much does it take them to verify the documentation of an EU student?\n\nThanks in advance.",

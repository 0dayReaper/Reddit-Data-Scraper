    "postText": "Hi, my friend is from Bangladesh and she wants to apply to KTH for the master's program in Machine Learning or Natural Language Processing (if there's one). She has really good grades. How competitive is it to get into the master's program? I know it's difficult but what are the chances usually? And what can help her make her chances better? Also, if she is willing to pay the tuition fee, does that make a change? Or is it completely irrelevant with the acceptance?",

At this level I don't think grades are the main key to make a difference between the applications but the experience, such as professional internships, interesting projects that one works on, and finally publications but not everyone has or need those.\n\nStart early with preparing the letter/personal statement to maximise the chances.",

Maybe he thought the quality was bad(big surprise) or he was just salty for something else and wanted to complain online. \n\nHowever, I enjoy studying at KTH and I think you'd enjoy it as well. My friend at CS thinks there's too much work in pairs for projects so virtually you could pass without needing to be able to do programming, but that's just if someone would like to waste 3-5 years of their lifes and knowing this in beforehand. \nOtherwise it is one of the most popular bachelors at KTH with a high entry bar for Swedes to get accepted.",

Like what GPA I should get in order to almost secure my place in undergraduate CS?",

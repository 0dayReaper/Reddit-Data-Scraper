    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m a BSc student at TU Delft that is looking to maybe pursue the above mentioned degree at KTH in 2021/2022. To note: I\u2019ve already been accepted for the MSc Applied math course in TU Delft and will be doing a bridging programme next school year since my bachelors was in something different. I will complete this programme definitely and so will be eligible for admission in KTH as I fulfill the 45 credits in math requirement \n\nI\u2019ve got a few questions about admissions and life in Stockholm if anyone would be kind to answer;\n\nIs admission for this degree competitive, and is a high point average necessary? Mine is by far not amazing but I\u2019ve got some high scores in physics and math.\n\n\nIs the KTH atmosphere fun and joyful like Chalmers for example? Or is it very study orientated and not so outgoing?\n\nHow\u2019s the degree itself, is it internationally respected at the level of TU Delft? And is employability just as good if not better? This is probably my main concern!\n\nThanks for any replies :)!",

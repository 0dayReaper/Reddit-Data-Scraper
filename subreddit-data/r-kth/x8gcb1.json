    "postText": "Greetings\n\nI would like to know how hard are the studies in KTH in comparison to other countries, I got a bachelor degree in mechanical engineering from Politecnico di Torino  (Italy). The work load there was huge and extensively demanding. I would love to have an idea  how things are in KTH thank you!",

            "comment": "Hi, I got a Bachelor as well from Politecnico di Torino and I then moved to Sweden to do my MSc here at KTH.\nSpeaking from my experience, but im sure it can change from branch to branch, the comparison is laughable when coming from Italian universities. The workload is probably 10 times less than what we re used to have to study in Italy.\nThat is mainly due two factors: how the courses and their evaluations are structured, which makes it extremely easier to pass and get great grades, but also a general lower level of knowledge and details expected from the students.\nSo I wouldn't worry about it. Write me in private if you want to know more.",

    "postText": "Hello there! I am intending to apply for d aforementioned degree in this university. However, ive read several reviews concerning the lack of support from the teaching staff and several problems with the teaching curriculum (exam structure, being inadequate etc), though these are mostly concerning masters. Could anyone care to share their experiences in kth? In addition to this, i am also applying to unimelb, monash, ubc and waseda university for computer science. If anyone would be kind enough to share their academic experiences and job opportunities post graduation from kth it would be great! Thanks",

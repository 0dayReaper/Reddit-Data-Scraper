    "postText": "Hello team, I will hopefully join KTH for a Bachelor in September (EU student).\n\nI have four questions.\n\nFirst, what is a general overview of the workload on a weekly basis translated into hours?\n\nSecond, is there a monthly grant I can apply for as an EU student?\n\nThird, am I entitled to a free language course by any means? I would love to learn Swedish.\n\nFinally, is the city bike friendly? If so, can you do everything by bike?\n\nThanks in advance!",

There are some hardcore people biking with ice and snow as well. I guess you have to give it a try during winter:).  \n\n\nCongratulations and have a nice start!",

However, I don't know what options you have for accomodation, some parts of Stockholm will be too far away for most people to commute by bike.",

I assume since they announce the results for the second group mid July there is not a huge housing issue.\nWhat is an average price for a 30-40 Sam studio for one person max 20 mins by bike from the campus?",

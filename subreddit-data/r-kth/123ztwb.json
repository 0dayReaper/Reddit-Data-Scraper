Your responses will remain completely anonymous, and the data we collect will be used to inform our research and allow us to better understand what you are looking for in your career.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy participating in our survey, you will have the opportunity to share your thoughts on topics such as career prospects and expectations as well as general career related questions. Your input will help us identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to address the needs of professionals working with tech, particularly at non-tech companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe appreciate your time and consideration in participating in our study. Your contribution is vital to our research, and we thank you for your willingness to help us better understand the computer science industry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to participate you can scan this QR code or click the link above to go to the survey! Thank you so much again for your time and help! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59hoej54gcqa1.png?width=270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9cda8a81b7e3cdb3bc3362bcc04890b5d76a5af5",

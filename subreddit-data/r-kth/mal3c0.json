    "postText": "Hey, guys! I am currently studying BSc in Computer Science at TU Delft.  In our third year we have the opportunity to do a minor abroad. My first option would be KTH, and I was wondering if you recommend it for an 6-month Erasmus exchange. :)\n\nBesides, we can do our bachelor thesis abroad. That I would also prefer to do somewhere else. Do you think it's hard to convince a professor to supervise my work so I can get it approved by TU?\n\nAlso, in case I do not manage to be accepted for the exchange.. Do you think I could still manage to convince a professor even though I haven't studied at KTH by that point?\n\nThanks a lot in advance!",

            "comment": "An Erasmus exchange is typically a life-defining experience. I would highly recommend that you try it, if you can.\n\nGenerally speaking, I would recommend a 12-month exchange over 6 months. The reason is that you will spend a lot of time and energy establishing yourself in the new country, so you get a better payoff if you stay a bit longer. Also, by staying 12 months, you get to experience all four seasons in Sweden ;)\n\nKTH has extensive exchange programs and lots of activities for Erasmus students. It is also one of the highest ranking universities in Sweden and has lots of courses in English, so from that perspective it's a pretty good choice. \n\nNote that your thesis, if you are taking an Engineering degree, is generally done in cooperation with a company in Sweden. The University has more of a supervisory role. I have no idea how this interacts with TU Delft, nor what, if any, effect an Erasmus exchange would have on a German thesis.",

You basically work alone, get one supervisor from the TU Delft  and another one from the host university.\n\nDo you think KTH could still accept to supervise my work?",

    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently finishing my bachelor's degree on Computer Studies on Spain and I was thinking about applying next year for a Master's Programme on KTH (Medical Engineering).\n\nSince I'm an EU student and (if I understood correctly) I don't need to pay any admission/tuition fees, that sounds like a great deal (besides Stockholm being expensive to live in), so I was wondering what are the admission rates for that masters (or masters in general). I tried looking at http://statistik.uhr.se/ but even with Google Translate I'm a bit lost.\n\nTL;DR I want to know if I have some chance to get in a Master's Programme on KTH or if I need to have a very good average on my finished degree.\n\nThanks in advance!",

The number of applicants who have been offered a place in this selection group is 26\" \n\nDo I have a chance to get admitted? and Do I need to wait until second admission round or one person declines the offer? \n\nPlease let me know. Thank you! ",

Your placement might improve or worsen in the second round depending, among other things, on how the final grades from highschool (gymnasium) turns out.\n\nHaving said that, being first reserve in the second round would be promising.",

I am waitlisted at no. 7 for the interactive media technology program. initially, there were 58 people in my group now it's 52 and I assume there will be some more people declining their offers. Also, this program does not have a second selection round. Can you comment on KTH's waiting list like when they start offering students?",

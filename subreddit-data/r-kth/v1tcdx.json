Incoming exchange student to KTH :) According to KTH i\u2019m a full-time student with 27 credits, but the minimum to qualify as a full-time student on the migrationsverket website is 30. Anyone knows if 27 would be sufficient? Thanks so much! \n\nAlso would appreciate any information regarding health insurance (eg. whether KTH provides for international students) or just pointers in general\n\nThanks a lot! :)",

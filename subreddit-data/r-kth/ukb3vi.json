Of course depending on what kind of company you are looking for, but in general if you have a master's from a good European University and some internship experience in the field, I think you should be able to find a job in any European tech hotspot.\n\nI don't know if the equation changes drastically when you are from outside the EU and need a visa, but I don't think so.",

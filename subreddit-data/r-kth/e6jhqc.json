    "postText": "Hi! I am filling out my application for the MSc Aerospace Engineering (september 1, 2020) and I understand that neither a CV, a motivation letter nor recommendation letters are required. Is this accurate? Can I attach any of these even if they are not required? I e-mailed the admissions office but they have not yet responded, and my professors need to know if they have to send a letter before the Christmas break. Thank you very much!",

If not, I can say that there shouldn't be any problems if you attach documents that aren't asked for in your universityadmissions.se application. Just make sure that you upload all the required documentation first (in your case it should be General documents + summary sheet if I'm not mistaken) and then proceed with the others.",

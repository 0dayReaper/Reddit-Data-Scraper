    "postText": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m going to finish in about a year my bachelors in energy engineering and was looking into the program at KTH. I wanted to ask if someone coursed it and could tell me how hard and engaging the course and professors are? \n\nAlso, to the general (possibly international) student, I wanted to ask what do they think of the KTH?\n\nHow do you guys do for accommodation? Are there lower than avg apartments to share with students that come at a lower price? Does the university offer it at lower prices to MSc students?\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll add some more questions in the comments \n\nThank you in advance!!",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm just starting a 2-year Master's program at KTH and have been considering signing up for THS. I went to check it out today and found out that it is 330 SEK. It's not THAT much but it's an amount I'd rather not spend unless I were sure I'd make that money back in savings. The one perk that appeals to me is the option to join the SSSB housing queue. I'll be here for at least 2 years, so if I could get a proper place for the 2nd year, that'd be really nice. My question is: Is renting first-hand cheaper than renting 2nd-hand? Would I save a decent amount of money? And is there a high chance that I could even get an apartment after a year on the waitlist? ",

I would consider that alone being worth it.\n\nAccess to SSSB is a huge bonus, student housing is much cheaper than in the city (compare prices on sssb &amp; blocket) &amp; one year will net you a room in a corridor with shared kitchen, or better if you are willing to browse the site for last-minute housing. \n\n\n",

If you go the the pubs a couple of times and buy something at the caf\u00e9 with the discount you've probably saved money when the year is over. \n\nYou also help finance all the behind the scenes kind of things, like the work on improving the education for KTH-students, career-fairs etc (http://ths.kth.se/about-ths/ths-organisation/what-is-ths).",

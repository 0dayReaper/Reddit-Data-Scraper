    "postText": "Hej all,\n\nJust wanted to share with you a summary of how the KTH Chapter launch in Spain went. It took place in Barcelona, and around 50 former KTH Alumni joined in an evening full of great conversations, tapas, and drinks. \n \nIf you have any questions on how to start a chapter or organize these kind of events don't hesitate to ask me!\n\nhttps://www.kth.se/en/alumni/event/event/interntationella-event/chapter-launch-in-spain-1.652609\n\nOriol / For The Love Of Branding",

I believe the KTH community can give precious advice as well. Thank you so much for your help!",

                    "comment": "Thank you Hefty - Oh, I don't expect to have all of them, but at least one.\n\nBSc in International Development - areas like sustainability, economics of development, methods for social science research.\n\nHowever, I also have 8 exams of Computational Engineering courses (basically, the foundations in calculus, geometry, physics etc.).\n\nThe interest in network science came from the work I developed at my former startup and from a research collaboration as data-scientist at a research institute.\n\nThe interest in research is a follow up of these activities.\n\nParticularly, I already wrote a research proposal for PhD that would related to sustainability embedded in economics and financial graphs, that would include a part of earth science (computational sustainability). I haven't found a supervisor yet. If I found a supervisor, I'd go for it and sure it'd be much easier to find a sponsorship.\n\nWhy do I care about econophysics + earth science ?It is an area I'm into due to the purpose - I care about ecological and societal sustainability (that I proxy by inequality). Given my former studies and experience, I believe (and hold passion) to tackle sustainability from the dynamics of  systems (hence, graphs and networks) rather than from social science / behavioural research (biased from representative samples of people).\n\nWhat about ethology and animals and .. communication in non-human species ?The field of computational ethology is because : I love it.Not just \"cognitively\" as the former, but also emotionally.\n\nA working life of 50% using computers for something I emotionally relate, and 50% going on the field, at best outdoor (or into the wild) would resonate with my being.\n\n\\--\n\nMy current situation is that I am challenged also by job research. So if I have to go for MSc, it would be highly beneficial if I could sell the skills right away in the job market (working student) and highly beneficial that the University is strong in its network  for future.\n\nAny tip, highly appreciated.",

                            "comment": "Well, you mentioned econophysics specifically and I think I can comment on that. Most econophysics research is based on extrapolating models that had worked on physics and then changing the narrative. I would not look for a research position related to econophysics since there are very limited options and physicist tend to be very \"gatekeepy\" in that regard. Also, most econophysics literature  don't resort to network science or complex networks. \n\nIf you are looking for a MSc covering topics in complex systems in Sweden, maybe check out Chalmers MSc in Complex Adaptive Systems, it is the closer I can think of related to those topics. What type of worked were you doing at this startup that needed to use network science that much?",

It would increase your chances of getting into a PhD, while for a PhD in ML it is indeed unlikely to enroll in one of those programs without having a really strong mathematical background.",

            "comment": "The difficult choice for me about MSc it is ML applied to a domain of interest is emerging field. The field were i have more affinity is international development, in a way connected to economics and sustainability. I found MSc in computational sustainability only in UK, too costly for me. Computational ethology i dont have biology courses. Concerning economics approached via network science and ML, answers are intersting but at PhD level.\nSo i wonder if a MSc in data science can fit for openings in these areas, also in terms of possibility to engage on field research at some point.\n\nAlso , i wonder how much a background of MSc would count for a PhD, with regards to relavant working experience. I wonder if i could take a MSc as \"a title\" and meanwhile some volunteerimg side project or former works may count to steer in the direction i want, or if instead the chosen MSc course would be fundamental in carving a directory.",

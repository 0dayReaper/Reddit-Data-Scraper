I know there\u2019s a ceremony in city hall which you can apply for but I was thinking if there will be some sort of ceremony beforehand in which they hand out degrees and family/friends will gather around.\n\nThis worries me because I will probably be standing there alone so I would to prepare myself emotionally. \n\nAnyone that already has graduated and probably could fill me in on the process?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your kind words and wishes. I will definitely attend the ceremony and keep the memory. Appreciate all the love and support.",

But my friend, so far more people here, myself included, congratulate you on your graduation than who showed up to mine. I can tell you attending my graduation was worth it. It was closure to the countless hours I spent studying and working hard to achieve a major milestone in my life. Again, CONGRATULATIONS!",

Honestly it\u2019s a lot of hurrying up to wait around and then you have like 10 seconds of glory. Most people take the photos of friends family after ceremonies. Most colleges take the standard photo of one of the deans handing you the degree. You can take off after, ditch the itchy cape, and celebrate alone. Any moments of feeling \u201cAwkward\u201d or alone should be really minimal.",

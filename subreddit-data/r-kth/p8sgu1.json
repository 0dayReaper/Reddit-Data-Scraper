    "postText": "I\u2019m considering coming to KTH this year but I am concerned about COVID and the safety protocols in Stockholm.  I have a health condition that puts me at greater risk if I get sick.  While people had taken their masks off after getting vaccinated where I live, with the rise of the delta variant, people are now recommending mask wearing indoors in public spaces again for everyone.  \n\nI\u2019ve read some sad stories about people feeling alienated or even being assaulted in Sweden for wearing face masks in public.  Was wondering if anyone with experience can tell me what that is like in Stockholm?  I imagine I\u2019ll be using public transportation a lot, so I\u2019ve been thinking about what that will be like if no one is wearing masks.  Is it weird for people to wear face masks in public there?  How about on campus or on the busses?  \n\nThanks!",

So there will be a plan to have online lectures which means you can be at home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not weird to wear a facemask and nobody will shame you for it.",

That said you are very free to wear a mask.\n\nAlso, if you are at risk, then you are not supposed to be traveling at all in Sweden. Most/\"all\"  lectures and stuff are online during these times.",

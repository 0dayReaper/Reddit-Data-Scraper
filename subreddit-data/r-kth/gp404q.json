    "postText": "A competition like formula student but for small scale AUTONOMOUS model cars that use mostly 3D printed parts. It could perhaps be held yearly and would allow teams to come up with innovative vehicle designs, for example strong, organically inspired structures and good self driving software. The competitions could be held internally for KTH and then externally against Chalmers, Uppsala and Lund etc. Just an Idea I had and I wanted to see if there was interest. \n\nAny thoughts?\nTL;DR; Proposal of racing competition for 3D printed autonomous model cars",

Also cool how it could be extended to include autonomy, and potentially material design and what not :) Super fun to have collabs with other groups/unis as well!",

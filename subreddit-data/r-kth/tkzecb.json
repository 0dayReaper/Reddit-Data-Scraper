I am applying to KTH for the ICT Bachelor's degree (as a first year EU student) but cannot seem to find much information about the quality of the program, so any information about opportunities offered, classes, professors etc would be very much appreciated.\n\nAlso, does anyone know if you can skip classes if you have already taken them?\n\nThanks :)",

I looked at the TUM management program and it seems to be heavily business oriented, but I am looking for a program more oriented towards computer science/informatics. \n\nHowever, I will too apply for the TUM program so thank you for the info!",

This seem to be one of their broadest yet internationally oriented programs. So you could combine both the business parts of management and CS courses. See it as a combo which is internationally sought after. TU Munich has a good reputation as well when preparing students for the international market. KTH has until very recently began to open up more internationally for Bachelors, so this is why I personally would recommend TU Munich since it has already has a more well established program in case you want the international experience, but once again this is just my personal take. Other than that, as for the Swedish IT sector the ICT program at KTH is pretty good, albeit oriented more towards the Swedish/Scandinavian market.\n\nEdit:\nI could imagine that if one would end up working for the larger telecommunications firms like Ericsson or well known companies like ABB, Scania or Spotify, a few years of job experience could land you on their offices overseas in case one would like to have more of a \u201cglobal\u201d work experience. Have relatives who\u2019ve attended both Bsc ICT at KTH and the Management program at TUM.",

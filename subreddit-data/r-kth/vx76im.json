Also your merit it's pretty high.\nMoreover, I can tell you from experience (I finished Master at KTH last year) that many people, especially from outside the EU, drop out in September when the scholarships results are published in their own country. Therefore if you are in the first waitlist you have very good chances to get in",

Saying this as someone who didn't get in 6 years ago as 1st in the waitlist.",

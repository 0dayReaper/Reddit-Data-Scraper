I was hoping I could speak to someone who was familiar with the application process or someone who is currently enrolled in the program about some specific questions? If that might be you, I'd appreciate a PM.",

The Education Office just got back to me and told me to get a Prior Learning Assessment, I need to... contact Professor Norlander lol. It looks like the depts aren't talking to each other much :P",

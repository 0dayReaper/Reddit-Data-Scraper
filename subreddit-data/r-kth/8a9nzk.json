I googled extensively for this list, didn't get anything back. Does anybody know anything more about this?\n\nAlso, how do those numbers look? The automated email from KTH said that reserve list chances are usually very slim, but having 5 people not accept their spot doesn't sound all that impossible...",

I am assuming the result you got now is the first round of selections, and if you are waiting list number 72 i'am afraid it's not looking to good.",

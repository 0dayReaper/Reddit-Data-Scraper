Can you tell me a bit about it?\" This is the big deal, you serach for an opportunity at companies who usually take in a few students every year, and if you connect and make good use of what they are giving you you will most likely get a job there. I did my thesis at a company but I wanted to work somewere else so i went the other route.",

The website wouldn't let me use my personnnummer when signing up for some reason, but after I uploaded my Swedish passport all the options to pay the application fee disappeared and I didn't have any problems. \n\nDo you actually live in Sweden? I think even though I have Swedish passport I still count as an international student since my home address is not in Sweden. And if you have a swe passport then you definitely have a personnnummer, it's literally on the passport photo page.",

You'd have a personal number if you had lived in Sweden before.\n\nBut don't worry, it won't affect you in any serious way. At most you will get their newsletters that are aimed for international students. Stuff about orientation days, social events and other things that are aimed for international students to help them settle in a new country and get friends. They'll probably be useful for you too.",

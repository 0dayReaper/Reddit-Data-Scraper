    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI would like to know if it is possible for a full-time worker to take a bachelor's at KTH? Electrical/Electronics engineering in specific. Mainly:\n\n\\- are classes mandatory?\n\n\\- are there any night programs?\n\n\\- how do evaluation work? When do exams and labs take place?",

            "comment": "Some few classes are mandatory, exams take place at the end of each study period, end of December, end of may , October and end of march with retests the next exam period(start of January , start of June,end of august and end of October). You can take as many retest as you want. Labs are usually running alongside the course(you can present them early if you finish them fast enough). The workload could be though for some people especially if your doing full-time work but i know some people who managed to do it. \n\nBut i think a master would be better suited for you since it offers more flexibility with more free study time(less emphasis on classes and more emphasis on labs and working from home) also more lectures takes place late 16-18,17-19 compared to bachelor where its usually 8-15 . All the master classes are in English too compared to bachelor where most are in Swedish.",

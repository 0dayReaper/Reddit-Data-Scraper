I am trying to get an idea of my chances but do not understand the grade groups with this link.

My meritv\u00e4rde in the BII group would be 21.87. Does anyone know what this stuff means?",

I was placed in BI and BII both, i was placed in reserves in BI and got selected in BII group.  Not sure about what BIAV or BIBF is about though, maybe it depends on how their merit grade is translated and you only compete against those people? \n\nIf you checkout [this](https://www.uhr.se/studier-och-antagning/antagningsstatistik/detaljsida/?utbildningId=9288C57EBF10CF6CFA6D42E48C7D4601&amp;astasearchperiod=HT22&amp;astasearchfor=Kth&amp;astasearchcategory=) page and check admission score in selection 1 and 2 you'll see different merit for BIAV, BIBF  and BII so you wont be competing in that pool i guess.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I am travelling to Sweden in late August for the fall term of KTH. I will be studying mechatronic and biomedical engineering courses. I was wondering if anyone can recommend me any decent accomodation near the university. It is better to live at the university accomodation? a share house? or an individual living arrangement? I am not sure what price range to expect. I also cannot speak Swedish. I will be staying for about 5 months. ",

            "comment": "Hi! I am a Swedish student at KTH. \n\nMost exchange students get their accommodation through [KTH Accommodation](https://www.kth.se/en/student/studentliv/accommodation). They do not guarantee you a place to live if you are an exchange student, but they find a place for most. The application process is described in the link. I think the price point is between 3500 - 5500 SEK. \n\nMost Swedish students get their accommodation through [SSSB](https://www.sssb.se/en). Their system is set up by queening, so when an apartment is available, it put up on their website and anyone can apply for it. The one with the most days gets it. To be in the queue, you need to be a member of a student union in Stockholm, but you can collect up to 90 days in the queue before that. So sign up now! The simplest forms of housing (dorms with shared kitchen) usually require 200 days, but in rare cases only 100, so it's possible. It's also a good idea to collect these days in case you happen to be in Sweden longer than you planned. \n\nAnother possibility is the [Student union housing market](https://www.facebook.com/groups/THShousing/). More tips can be found at their [website](https://ths.kth.se/general/ths-membership/accommodation-sssb/).\n\nOther places, not aimed only at students, for housing include for example [blocket](https://www.blocket.se/bostad/uthyres/stockholm). Expect to pay 5000 - 8000 SEK for a single room. \n\nFor reference, an ordinary student budget is 10000 SEK per month in total, this is the allowance + student loan all Swedish students have access to through the government.

Have you studied at KTH earlier or something, otherwise you should mail or call the responsible person for the master. You might need to \"translate\" the courses you took into what KTH requires of you and then you might need to read some courses to have the right background. But probably it's  maximum 2-3 courses I believe. Either way, get in touch with KTH and ask them. :) ",

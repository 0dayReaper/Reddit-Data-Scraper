    "postText": "Hello everyone,\nMy name is Riccardo. I'm currently in my 4th year in high school. Can't wait to get out, the school system here is oppressive, to say the least.\n\nI'd really like to move to Sweden and study at KTH in the near future, it looks like a really nice environment to study and grow. I have some doubts regarding the application process though.\n\nThe English tests should not be a problem and my school (Liceo Scientifico) should satisfy the admission requirements for the programme I intend to join, Bachelor's degree in Information and Communications technology (I'd really appreciate it if any italian student currently enrolled in that programme could confirm this). I read that \"the application process is highly competitive\" on the KTH website.\n\nIs there is any way to maximize my chanche of being accepted?\n\nIf I'm not accepted, can I try again next year?\n\nIf i do not satisfy the admission requirements (Mathematics E, Physics B), can I study those subjects myself, take a test, and apply again?\n\nThank you very much for your time, have a good day :)",

You should contact the school about this for some better answers. Here's a link: https://www.kth.se/en/studies/meet-kth/contact-1.602882\n\nOtherwise I think you could just shoot a mail over to info@kth.se with basically exactly this post.\n\nGood luck!",

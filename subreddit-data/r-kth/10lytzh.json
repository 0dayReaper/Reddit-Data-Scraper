    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI'm an IB student interested in applying to KTH for Bachelor's ICT program. I had a few questions about the application. On KTH's website, the application deadline seems to be from 15 March-17 April, but I also saw that it mentions to submit all required documents by 1st February in the following website: [https://www.kth.se/en/studies/bachelor/how-to-apply-for-bachelor-s-studies-1.450312#:\\~:text=Submit%20all%20required%20documents%20to,University%20Admissions%20by%201%20February](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/bachelor/how-to-apply-for-bachelor-s-studies-1.450312#:~:text=Submit%20all%20required%20documents%20to,University%20Admissions%20by%201%20February). I'm confused when the deadline is for the application, considering that I'm an EU citizen. Also, I assume that for IB students we must apply with our final grades in KTH? \n\nIf anyone has any information, can you please let me know. Any help will be appreciated! :)",

Non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizens will most likely not have enough time to obtain a residence permit.   \n15 March: Application opens  \n17 April: Application closes  \n2 May: Supply document of fee exempt status or receipt of application fee  \n21 June: Document submission deadline. If you're completing your upper secondary studies in an EU/EEA country, Switzerland or an IB/EB programme, you have until 5 July to submit your documents. All other supporting documents should be submitted together with your application.  \n12 July: Admission results announced  \n21 July: Last date to reply to your offer  \n27 July: Final admissions results  \nAugust: Arrival and study start",

    "postText": "Hello. I was hoping someone from KTH would be able to answer my questions. I am looking into the Master's in Machine Learning degree at KTH for August 2019. Given that I have a Master's in a similar field (Electrical Engineering with Data Science Track) from a high-ranked US university and have done well in my classes, I am optimistic about the possibility of getting a competitive scholarship that covers tuition and fee for international students from outside of Europe. However, there do not seem to be any scholarships that would cover living expenses. I was wondering, if it is possible or probable to be able to secure a part-time job at Stockholm that could cover my living expenses. I do not mind living in a cheaper area away from campus or living in a house/apartment with multiple house-mates. I also have no issues with working 20-30 hours of part-time work, or however much I can while studying if I need to. But I am just not sure if it is reasonable to be able to expect to cover all living costs from a part-time job. The program at KTH looks very exciting, but I do have reservations towards leaving my current position where I am working and saving a little bit of money, and going into a spot where I would have to dig into my savings to pay for my subsistence. If any students or alumni from KTH could help me out with my questions, I would be very grateful. Thank you in advance.",

One exception in my opinion is working as a TA at the faculty; that kind of work (if you can do it) is much easier to combine with your studies as you can use gap times to your advantage and there is less travel than if you have a separate workplace.",

Students who have taken the course before are often the first choice, but many professors will gladly accept more workpower if they can get it. If you've TA'ed before it's of course easier, but even if not, do this: make a list of the courses you think you could handle and find their course representatives (or teachers, or even existing TA's). Email them saying you have experience with the course content and are looking or work, and would they be interested in having another TA for the course? Sometimes it's even better to get a word in with current TA's first because if they trust you, the chance that the teacher will is higher.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or would like to get in touch, feel free to DM me.",

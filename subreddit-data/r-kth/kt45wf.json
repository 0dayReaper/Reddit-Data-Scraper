    "postText": "I'm applying to KTH and Uppsala Master's programs via universityadmissions.se and I've ranked the programs, paid the fee (non-EU), and uploaded all required documents. However there is no particular final \"Submit\" button, so as to freeze or finalise the application. Should I just wait till the Jan 15 deadline for it to automatically submit? Any pointers from anyone who has gone through this process would be appreciated!\nP.s. I thought about emailing them but I have already contacted them once about an unrelated issue, don't want to come off as annoying! It's just I'm really excited and anxious about this.",

    "postText": "Hi! The fees for the Msc Aerospace Engineering course has been listed as 310,000 SEK on the website. Does the \" , \" here represent a decimal meaning is this 310 SEK or is it 310000 SEK ? Wanted to get this cleared out since it's a major confusion. Apologies if this is a silly doubt.",

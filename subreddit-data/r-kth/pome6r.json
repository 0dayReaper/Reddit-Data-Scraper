            "comment": "Most Swedish students make do with government students loans+grants, which add up to about 10 900 SEK/month. That allows you a reasonable, but by no means luxurious, lifestyle. Getting into student housing can be pretty hard if you haven\u2019t lived in Stockholm before and don\u2019t have points in the housing queue, I think (someone else can hopefully correct me on this) there might be some rooms reserved for international students though! Otherwise you\u2019re likely to end up paying something like 5000 SEK/month for a room or shared apartment, but obviously this is highly variable depending on how big the place is, the location etc. Hope that helps! :)",

Generally I'd say the estimate of 5000sek is on the the low end of student housing, and you'd definitely be paying more for non-student accommodation. You can get by with the remaining money for sure but it does require frugality and planning. Stockholm is expensive and if you want to get by, plan on preparing 90% of your meals at home.\n\nAlso I would add that if you live on campus you'll be saving a lot of money on public transport which also is a big expense.",

I've done it with a wife and new born and other commitments on top of school and work. It's doable certainly.\n\nClass hours vary wildly depending on what you're doing. I do school work 8-16 mon-fri and typically manage. Certain periods i work weekends too, others i don't.  It's tough to gauge, but consider it a full time job where you set your own hours. \n\nI don't know if that made it any clearer.",

Typically 1-2 lectures per week per class, which is anywhere from 4-8 hours considering 2 courses typically.

I did math SL and it got translated to matte 5. I would suggest doing math HL if you have it in you though, it will prepare you better for KTH, especially if you think you can get a high enough grade. \n\nI think the points required to get in have drastically increased post-Covid. I would probably aim for 40+ nowdays, just to be in the clear. You need to be tactical with which courses will get you the highest grades. The people I know that got 42+ only chose classes that they knew they would get a 6 or 7 in. You need to check KTHs prerequisites though, most courses require matte 5, kemi 1, och fysik 2 if memory serves me correctly. \n\nGood luck! IB was a great experience. It\u2019s incredibly tough, but it sets you up well for life.",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI applied at KTH - Artificial Intelligence MSc degree, respectively Computer Science - international student.\n\nMy question is, how on what is the selection made?\n\n\\- Prestige of the old university? (well, luckily I attended a top university in my country - East Europe)\n\n\\- Grades? (over 9.20 out of 10, almost 9.4 out of 10)\n\n\\- CV? (but for AI there is no CV needed, although I have more than 2 years of work experience at two of the biggest IT companies in my country).\n\n\\- Motivation Letter? (it is poorly written. My talent at English essays is low, even get helped by a friend, and still poorly written - talked about the degree, work experience, and that is it).\n\n\\- Recommendation Letter? (from a good professor, and from my old team lead at work).\n\nThe results will be made public only on 9 April?",

            "comment": "The selection process is very subjective IMO. You seem to have good grades, Recommendation letter is very important good that you have atleast one academia coz that's what matters most to my knowledge. \n\nAlso you might want to do some research and see if you find any labs or professors interesting to work under (not a usual thing to do though). This would be very important if you are interested in AI research. I would also strongly recommend to explore the eco system if you find good companies to work. Since you mentioned you have east European degree, I presume you are European/EU so its not a big deal to get job elsewhere. If you are not you might want to dig deep there.\n\nGood luck, apply to more programs if you still can!",

Does KTH offer some kind of student financial aid?",

P.S I'm a non EU student so things might be different to you",

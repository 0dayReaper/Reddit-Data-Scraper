    "postText": "Hi guys!\n\nI'm reading up on HCI professors at KTH, in particular of the MID division. I'd like to get in contact with them to know more about PhDs and whatnot, but also their research of course. If any of you guys do Computer Science and have studied with them, or maybe even worked with them, do you have any thoughts, names or recommendations?\n\nI'm mainly interested in the XR/Mobile HCI/hand interactions side of things, but I'm pretty flexible. Any information is greatly appreciated!\n\nHave a great evening!",

I missed a lot of the orientation and campus events due to miscommunication and arriving here late.\n\nHonestly I just want to chill and meet people, go to bars and stuff. Any recommendations? Also I want to travel Europe as much as possible and I am looking for a group.",

Otherwise Tolvan is open for non-EE students after 10 pm tomorrow, come and have a beer or seven, we are often quite nice. Also, talk to the international reception, they usually arrange pubcrawls and differet events for all exchange students. The party scene of Stockholm centers around Stureplan, but it\u2019s pricey and overrated, the cool bars are usually found on S\u00f6dermalm, try Tr\u00e4dg\u00e5rden! For travelling I recommend going on weekend trips to some nice capitals, Prague/Berlin/Wien/Budapest and so on, and of course take the mandatory booze cruise to Finland and back.",

In your case I'm assuming it's either [Datasektionen](https://datasektionen.se/)  (which is housed in META on Campus Valhalla as mentioned by /u/SongsAboutFracking) or the [Chapter for Information- and Nanotechnology](http://insektionen.se/) (in Kista).\n\nI recommend you to get in touch with them to find out what activities they offer.",

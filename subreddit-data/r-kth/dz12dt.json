    "postText": "Hello everyone, I'm interested in applying for a master degree programme in CS at KTH and I started looking over for the programmes offered, especially for Computer Science and Software Engineering of Distributed Systems.\n\nI downloaded the PDFs with the Programme Syllabus for both programmes but I don't understand how to compile the possible courses I would like to follow.  \nFor example in [Computer Science Programme Syllabus](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/program/TCSCM-20202.pdf?l=en) there are some mandatory courses that all have to follow, other than that there's a selection of a track, for example CSSC o r CSTC.  \nAm I required to select one track, and of that pick a few courses from it?\n\nWhile checking the courses I didn't find on what period / semester they are done, by inspecting the courses in detail this information is still not shown.\n\nThanks for any reply / information",

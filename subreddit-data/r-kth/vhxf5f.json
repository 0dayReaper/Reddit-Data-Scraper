            "comment": "Sweden doesn't really have a scholarship tradition since university studies are free. With that said, in some cases you might be able to get some kind of scholarship for specific projects, minor field studies, research etc. Check out KTHs [overview on various scholarships](https://www.kth.se/en/student/stod/studier/stipendier/oversikt-olika-stipendier-1.1115700). I'd also recommend checking out this [collection of scholarships](https://www.fondpeng.se/) and grants you can apply for regarding various things.",

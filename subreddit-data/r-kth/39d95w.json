    "postText": "I'm currently a student at the University of Alabama. I am in mechanical engineering. As I understand it KTH is world renowned for this particular field. So my question to any faculty or students would be: 1) What should my next step be if I were interested in attending for anywhere from a semester to maybe even the completion of my degree. 2) What kind of cost would be associated with being a non resident and attending KTH. 3) What is Stockholm life like and how is the night life? 4) How big are sports, are there many athletic clubs associated with the school i could possibly look to join? Honestly I have always wanted to travel and to Sweeden in particular. I love engineering but I want my college experience to be an adventure and a successful one at that. Would I need to learn the language before hand? I have so many questions but anybodies perspective on things would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys! Also I'm 21 and a male whole loves sports and drinking so i guess im pretty typical if that factors in at all.",

            "comment": "* Mechanical engineering is split into many departments in KTH, so you would have to narrow it down to the ones listed [here](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/kth). Apply via www.universityadmissions.se\n\n* Cost? Try to find a tuition-fee waiver/scholarship at least! Living expense will be around 5000 SEK / month minimum.\n\n* I know KTH has a good ice-hockey team. There could be more, I am not sure (somebody fill in)\n\n* Everybody except elderly folk speaks English. Not necessary, still could be advantageous to learn it.",

English skill is in general very high here\n\nThere is student life in Stockholm, but it's considered to be not that great compared to the student towns such as Lund. Though there is always something if you are interested, but if it's the whole traditional \"college experience\" with dorms and shit, then kth doesn't really fit that mold too well. To me it works well, I live with my parents and it's cheap but I had a friend who moved to Lund just because of the better student life",

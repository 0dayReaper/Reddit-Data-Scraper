At first 20 ppl were accepted, but know the number of people dropped to 13 but my number is still 3. Is there any chance that i will be admitted?\n\nAnyway congratulations!",

They replied that they can't answer that but yesterday I got a mail from [antagningen.se](https://antagningen.se) and now it's time to head back to school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish you the best of luck with your spot friend.",

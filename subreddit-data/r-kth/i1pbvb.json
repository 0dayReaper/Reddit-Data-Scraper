    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nIn the beginning of July, I was offered a place for the ICT bachelor, an offer I accepted (so there is written \"admitted\" next to my application). \n\nYet, I haven't received anything besides a Notification of Selection Results, and messages in the website's mailbox redirecting me to KTH's website, with various informations on what to do from now on according to your course. The thing is the ICT bachelor for international students isn't among the list, and I haven't been contacted in any other way by KTH (except for not being granted accommodation). \n\nAnyone in the same situation ? (Btw I haven't been able to find housing in Stockholm, so if you guys could give me a hand I would be very thankful). \n\nThanks for helping me out ! (don't hesitate to send me private messages)",

If you send off an email to the study-representative ([sno@insektionen.se](mailto:sno@insektionen.se)) you'll get some great help - the current head is also an international student, who might have some awesome tips!\n\nSee you at the reception - that begins on the 10th of August!",

What I can tell you tho is the fact that my background was already very extensive in science, so I didn't have to take any exams or english tests (Merit rating &gt; 21 I remember correctly). I do not believe this course to be that hardcore to obtain, although it may be easier if you are from European or Scandinavian countries.   \nThe hardcore part is to find accommodation around Stockholm, which is very difficult (and expensive in some cases).",

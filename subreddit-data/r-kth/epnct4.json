    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm an architecture student in TU Delft, currently in my 2nd year of the Bachelors programme, however I've been allowed to make a formal application to do an exchange masters programme for one semester of my 3rd year bachelors.\n\nI was just wondering if someone could explain how the masters programme is structured? What kind of lectures do you recieve? Do you have much freedom in terms of what you're designing for 6 months? (if it is a 6 month design period?) And any other information about courses you have to follow or what you actually learn would be greatly appreciated! Thanks :)",

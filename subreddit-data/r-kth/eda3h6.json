    "postText": "I am currently doing a bachelor's degree in nanotechnology at the University of Bergen and the nanotech masters at KTH seems really interesting. Does anyone here know how difficult it is to get in? I know it varies somewhat from year to year, but what sort of grade average is likely expected? \n\nAny input is much appreciated.",

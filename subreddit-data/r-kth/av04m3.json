Or how hard is it to get into the KTH Bachelors ICT programme?   \n2. Is there any upcoming student community at KTH? I am also applying to Delft and we have a 100+ students in the Discord Channel  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "Hi there!\nI used to study ICT programme at KTH.\n\n1) It's not that hard to get into KTH's bachelor programme. If you have good grades from your highschool, you should be fine. Personally, I had to pass IELTS in order to get accepted, but this is not the case for everybody (depends on how English gets accredited in your country). However, this ICT programme is very difficult and demanding, so be ready to study a lot (I mean REALLY A LOT). I don't want to discourage you by no means, but many students leave after a few semesters or a year. This degree is highly valuable and opens up many opportunities for you which is definitely worth your time and effort.\n\n2) No clue.\n\nAlso, here are some tips:  \n- To make life a bit easier at KTH, you should start learning the basics of programming (unless you already know it)\n- KTH likes to change the structure of the exams, so every exam is quite different in comparison with the previous one. You will have to know a lot of material which some of it you might not have been covered during lectures\n- Don't get scared, if you fail exams. You can usually retake them at the end of the semester\n- Don't rush to buy all of the books, because you can either find them online, or ask 2nd-3rd year students and they will give you a link/tell you where to find it.\n\nMost importantly, don't miss the very few weeks when all of the events happen. Not much studying at the beginning, so you should party with your new classmates and get to know each other. Appreciate that time, because the exams will come in just around a month and a half\ud83d\ude43\n\nHope it helps! Cheers!\n",

Apart from my 12th year, all my high school grades were pretty much on point since I had got into a couple of extra-curricular activities which are still going on. (I am a gap year student) Although my 12th grade marks are way above the minimum required grades.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am talking to another student and she said that there are 35 students in ICT. That makes the program sound really competitive and exclusive.   \n\n\nWhat are your views on that? \n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "Our student community is a bit more offline, as we usually gather in the chapter hall for actives and pubs. But there is a thriving community of people engaged in the chapter, and stuff outside the chapter as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe usually have pubs and big parties, gasques as well as non-alcohol events where we play games and just hang out. We have a sports committee who do sporting events like football (not the american kind), floorball, etc. If you join one of the mastery's, who're in charge of the pubs there is a plethora of fun things to do internally and externally like cruises, gasques, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHS, which is the umbrella organisation for all the chapters hosts a lot of activities as well, from photography to light and studio equipment and even rocket launching!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you're accepted (fingers crossed) the best way to see all of this is the reception, where you'll see a bit of the silly old-fashioned KTH-student culture (won't spoil it too much, but it's a lot of fun and a lot of cringe). It's a 4-3 week introduction to student-life, it's a great way to get to know your peers as well as the older students (like me, I'll be one of the organizers).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really know that much about the international acceptance rates nor the exclusivity or competitiveness, but the international programs are usually almost as big (student-wise) as the Swedish version. But, I'd turn to the student-outreach people [(here)](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/bachelor/information-communication-technology/interview) and email them this question. They're more suited to answer this sort of thing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll else, like the student life - I'm your guy. If you have any more questions, just ask!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I've been one of the welcome buddies and I'd totally recommend attending as many events as possible! ",

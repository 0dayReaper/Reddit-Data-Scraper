    "postText": "Hello,\nI'm going to study in Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan (KTH) from August 2022 to January 2023. I'm a computer science and engineering student doing my master's degree.\nI\u2019m a girl trying to find an apartment in Stockholm, but no luck so far. My maximum budget is 6500/7000.\nI\u2019ve also looked on all the major websites (blocket bostad, hemavi), and facebook (I posted in all the popular groups), also applied to their residence from which I still have no answer...\nAugust is coming and I am getting pretty desperate for accommodation, does anyone have any tip?",

So I would suggest you to reach out again to KTH to establish that.\nUnfortunately I can't offer any solution myself but my best advice is to look on FB for the groups for the following student accommodations: Lappis and Kungdshamra. These are the 2 of the most popular student accommodation and there are multiple groups on FB where people sell stuff and put rooms for rent. It s usually pretty easy to find a room for some months.\nIt s also fairly usual to find a room not for the whole period that you need and having to find different rooms to cover the whole period you re going to be here.\nLet me know if you find the groups otherwise I can send you the link.\nGood luck",

I think they recently had some problems with some of their accomodations so they might not have place for everyone... But it might be fixed in the future. \n\nI would recommend queing on SSSB just in case and looking for something on fb or other places even if it is temporary so that you can get days in the SSSB queue or a late offer from KTH.",

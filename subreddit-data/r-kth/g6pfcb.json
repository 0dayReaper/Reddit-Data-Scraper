You'd have to apply after doing your bachelor. \n\nHowever that's the only difference between the CINTE (which is the 5 year swedish version of your program) and TCOMK, and both programs will fast track you to an AI masters. You'll just have to pick specific courses in the third and second year to be eligible.\n\nBut, you can definitely pursue AI at KTH and especially in Kista, where most of those courses are taught.",

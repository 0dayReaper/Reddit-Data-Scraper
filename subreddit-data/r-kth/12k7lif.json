    "postText": "Hello\n\nI got accepted at KTH for a summer internship (Erasmus+) and will be starting around July, problem is I am not eligible for KTH accommodation as they have told me that I am non tuition fee-paying student ( Group 4 as stated here https://www.kth.se/en/student/studier/accommodation/eligibility-and-application-1.809659) therefore they can\u2019t offer me housing unfortunately. \n\nThis is a problem for my visa application as well as they (Swedish embassy ) require proof of accommodation and I haven\u2019t even found an apartment or anything yet and its so difficult and most of the houses are expensive as well, I really don\u2019t know what to do, is there anything that can be done?\n\nYour advices are appreciated, Thanks in advance.",

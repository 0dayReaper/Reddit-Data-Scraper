    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nIam accepted at KTH Masters on entrepreneurship and innovation management program and I have some questions:\n\n1. I manage my small company/startup here in Egypt and I'm really hesitated whether to pursue and travel or not, so is it very overwhelming to study masters AND manage a company in another country? does anyone here went through the same experience? note my company is based on human resources so there are about 40 employees working in different departments and the economical situation is very fragile, we do our best every month to allocate enough money for salaries and basic expenses and barely make profits. Did anyone do it? is it doable?\n2. I'm travelling on my own expense and the university sent my the first invoice, can the university split it to multiple installments?\n3. It's a 1 year program, are there summer vacations in the masters programs and specifically this program so I can travel back to Egypt for let's say a month?\n4. The offer says accommodation is included for the 1st year, does that mean I don't have to make any other accommodation arrangements nor make extra payments?\n\nI appreciate detailed answers, thank you so much for you precious time.",

    "postText": "My masters application has been disqualified due to the late transcript submission. I am finishing my undergrad in the United States and I am required to mail the transcripts. My university sent out the transcripts on JANUARY 11th (3 weeks before the deadline) - I have a confirmation! Unfortunately I have no superpower to control mail and processing times. Disqualifying my application is extremely discouraging. I feel enlightened to the bureaucracy and ignorance of the system.  \nCould you please advise how to handle the situation?\n\nI emailed university admissions dot se twice and both times they said that they do not review documents received after the deadline, ignoring my argument.",

The fact is I have 240 ECTS and I finished my undergrad degree in the European Union.\nOfc, I mailed it to the university, and after few days the status of my application changed in \"in progress\", BUT ( and here comes the tricky part) I will be considered for the admission only after submitting my final diploma of undergraduate studies.\nWhen I started my application on November, I already have sent a temporary diploma available until my final diploma will be issued, AND the results of the admission will be revealed on April 3rd.\n\nSo far, this is my experience with KTH.",

The way theyre handling the Coronavirus, admissions, academics, scheduling, student relations, everything.... is poor. Your experience via email is what you'll get here as well, but in all aspects.\n\nThey're incompetent here. Don't come here.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. Me and my GF got admitted to KTH-ML MSc, so we are doing more in-depth search for KTH/Stockholm. Since she is a non-EU student, she is guaranteed to get KTH housing. I am an EU student, therefore KTH housing is not guaranteed for me. \n\nHow are the conditions for finding accommodation for student couples? What should be the road map?\n\nFor other cases, what do EU students coming outside from Sweden generally do to find housing?",

Since she is a non-EU student, you will probably get it, although it is not guaranteed. \n\nAlso, apply to SSSB housing as soon as possible so you can start collecting days for the queue. You can collect up to 90 days without being a member of a student union yet.",

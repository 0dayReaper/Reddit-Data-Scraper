    "postText": "Hello sweden comminity.\n\nI am a eu citizen that was interested in bachelors computer science. But as it turns out there is no bsc computer science in english in sweden (at keast not a good one). So here comes some questions...\n\n1-) Is the ICT degree that is taught in english goof in KTH\n\n2-) Is the degree valid all across europe? It surely must be recognised everywhere but i am just curious. Also other than europe what are the chances of it being recognised in usa?\n\n3-) Is the ICT english progran that they are offering new i cant seen to find any info on that. I hope it is here for a while so it has given some graduates in the past.\n\n4-) My tuttion is free since i am eu. Do i need to pay anything other than acconodation and food for ex holland wants health insurance.\n\nPlease help me if anyone knows the answers i am really open to any replies.\n\nHave a great and safe day everyone!!",

Generally speaking, a company will never complain about the validity, but a foreign university or in other official situations you may need translations. \n\n- accommodation goes from 2500 sek (if you are super lucky and get one with sssb or KTH accomodation).\nExpect to pay around 4000-5000 sek/month, depending from the area and the type of accomodation. \nCheck [KTH Accomodation](https://www.kth.se/en/student/studentliv/accommodation/kth-accommodation-1.374952), you may be in the \"granted accommodation\" category. Usually it is difficult to get one if you are not, but these times things are a bit different\n\n- health should be free as European citizen. But many suggest to get an additional insurance. Maybe KTH pays one for the students, no idea.",

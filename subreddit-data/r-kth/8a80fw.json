    "postText": "Today I got my results and I don't undestand what is going on. On my admission, I've picked 3 master programmes. \n\nMy first choice was Aerospace Engineering. And it says: \"Your waiting list number in this selection group is  86\nThe number of applicants who have been offered a place in this selection group is 38\".\n\nI can undestand that it is almost impossible to be offered a place on this programme. \n\nMy second choice was Turbomachinery Aeromechanic University Training, and on this programme I don't understand my results. It says: \"Your waiting list number in this selection group is  1\nThe number of applicants who have been offered a place in this selection group is 0\". \n\nCan someone explain this to me? No one have been offered a place in this group and I'm on a waiting list? How does it work?\n\nAnd my last choice was Engineering Materials Science, and on this master programme I've been offered a place.\n\nSo my questions are, how could I be on a waiting list for THRUST master's programme when no one has been offered a place, and what should I do now? Just wait for more information from the KTH university?",

So if that selection group's turn comes up, your name should be the first one to be called.\n\nI'm in a very similar mess though (even made a post at this subreddit just now), so take my words with a grain of salt -- i could be completely wrong.",

At the moment I'm waiting for an answer. I just received an email from Kth with some information about reserved and admitted places. So I'll wait for their answer. \n\nWish you the best for your results. Good luck! ",

I already have a Master's degree but I wanted to go for another one and I suspect that's why they placed me pretty much at the bottom of the barrel.\n\nI hope you get in. \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae \u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03b7 :)",

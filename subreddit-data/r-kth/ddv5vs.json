    "postText": "Hi, I applied for a PhD position at KTH over a month ago and would like to ask about the status now or rather just if a decision will be made anytime soon. Is it appropriate in Sweden (or KTH specifically) to directly call the responsible professor about that? Or is more common to send an email first (which, of course, is usually ignored/overlooked)?\n\nAlso, has anyone here applied for a PhD at KTH before? If yes, how long did it take to get any response?",

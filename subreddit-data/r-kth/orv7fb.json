If you don't remember much of high school math, I recommend to revise a little since you won't be there for the revision course.\n\nHighly recommend starting to participate in the chapter's activities (insektionen.se) from the beginning, it's a great way to get to know people, especially if you are not there for the orientation weeks.",

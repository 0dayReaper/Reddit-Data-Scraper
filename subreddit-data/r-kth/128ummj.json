Many also work to get a bigger budget. \n\n&gt;how is life in Sweden in general?\n\nCompared to what? \n\n&gt;would you recommend me to stay at KTH for this internship or find another European university that I should go to?\n\nThat's only for you to decide and depend on your own preferences.",

            "comment": "Exciting! I hope you'll enjoy your time here.\n\nFor context, I'm Swedish.\n\nWhen it comes to accommodation: Firstly, follow this instruction to start collecting queue days in SSSB, the largest student accommodation service: [https://sssb.se/en/looking-for-housing/how-do-i-apply-for-an-apartment/collecting-credit-days/](https://sssb.se/en/looking-for-housing/how-do-i-apply-for-an-apartment/collecting-credit-days/?cl=1493398725) . Outside of SSSB, I believe international students have priority and can get other housing through uni (sometimes even in houses on campus, which swedes can't apply for). You'll have to talk to your contact at KTH about this, I don't know how that works. Otherwise, sublets and flatshares can be found through Blocket Bostad ([https://bostad.blocket.se/p2/en/](https://bostad.blocket.se/p2/en/))  or in Facebook groups. Renting a room somewhere is around \u20ac550 or in downtown Stockholm more like \u20ac600-\u20ac750. Can be cheaper in student apartments though, in areas like Lappk\u00e4rrsberget or Kungshamra. Subletting a 1 bd or studio is around \u20ac1200 or \u20ac1600 downtown.\n\nIn terms of other prices: The campus cafeteria has really great lunch for around \u20ac8, cheap pubs have beer around \u20ac4 (or \u20ac2 on campus), a big mac meal is around \u20ac8, and mince meat is around \u20ac10 per kilo. It completely depends on your lifestyle and what you're comparing to, but most people find Stockholm pretty expensive. It's cheaper than places like Oslo, Copenhagen, Zurich, London or Dublin, but more expensive than the mediterranean, eastern europe, Germany, Amsterdam, Paris and so on.\n\nLife in Stockholm is great. It's safe, clean, there is a lot to do, and people are generally really friendly towards foreigners. The summers are amazing and Stockholm is really beautiful in the summertime. The rest of the year (Oct-Apr) is pretty rough. We had snow up until yesterday. You should google weather statistics to pack properly.Making friends can be a bit challenging, but it can still be done (swedes are quite reserved). This video explains the problem pretty well: [https://youtu.be/\\_JrfZH3VZSI](https://youtu.be/_JrfZH3VZSI) . However, KTH has plenty of activities at the start of the semester, where you can meet a lot of people and have a lot of fun.

( I don\u2019t drink, i don\u2019t go out alot as well, maybe some sightseeing in stockholm) cause i will be pretty busy with the internship. \n \nIf I have questions in the future, i will definitely DM you  so maybe we can discuss it over discord.\n\nThank you again, appreciate it.",

                            "comment": "No problem! Regarding budget: like I said, it depends a lot on how you spend your money.\n\nUs Swedish students get \\~12000 SEK (\u20ac1100) a month in a standardised package of benefits &amp; loans, and you can usually get by with that if you spend around \u20ac500 on rent. Per week, that's around \u20ac70 left for food and \u20ac70 for leisure and other expenses.\n\nA student public transport card (unlimited travel in all forms) is \u20ac60/month.",

Sweden does not provide you with any student benefits, other than tuition-free programmes for European students (EU/EEA/Switzerland).\n\nCheck out this KTH page about scholarships: https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/general/scholarships/scholarship-opportunities-for-master-s-studies-1.860447\n\nRegarding part-time jobs, I've had many Swedish friends that have found part-time jobs in IT (our field of study) - as well as jobs in tutoring or hospitality - but I have no idea what your chances are as an international student without knowledge of Swedish. That said, you do encounter a lot of hospitality workers that only speak English here in Stockholm so it's definitely not impossible. I would just google it or get in touch with businesses directly if I were you.",

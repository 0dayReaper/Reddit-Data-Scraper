You can get by with English but you will miss out on a  a lot of the undertones and gossips about you if you don\u2019t know Swedish and you may not be able to get that connection with your colleagues/customers/bosses. \n\nIf you are doing sales/retail/service industry, then yes Swedish is very important.",

I am a student currently doing IB (last year) in Stockholm and was thinking of doing my bachelor at KTH and applying next year.\nIs anyone taking the Bachelor in Information and Communication Technology currently at KTH (in English preferably, my swedish is bad :( )? If so would you be willing to have a quick conversation where I could get a bit more information about what it is?\n\nThanks in advance :))",

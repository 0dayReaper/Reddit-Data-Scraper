    "postText": "Hello all, I plan on applying to kth for the above mentioned course in 2021. I have 89%+ in my bachelor's in information technology (CS) and I think I'll clear the English language cutoff. My questions are:\n\n1. Do I need GRE (the requirements don't explicitly say that they don't want gre score)\n\n2. How's Stockholm and Sweden in general for jobs in ML and AI? \n\n3. Is Stockholm the best city in Sweden for jobs in ML and AI?\n\n4. Is it dangerous to live in Stockholm as Buddhist? (Considering the car bombings and stuff)\n\n5. Any Indians currently studying computer science or ML  in KTH? \n\nThanks",

I have read that tech companies usually don't have problem hiring English speaking people but I don't think I'll be able to reach a level comfortable enough to use and speak Swedish for job in 2 years of my masters. Also since you replied no to 3, then what is the best city for tech in Sweden then?",

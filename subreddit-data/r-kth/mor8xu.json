    "postText": "Hello, I am an Italian Aerospace Engineeriny graduate and have just been admitted to the THRUST program. Looking to contact students and ex-students (especially the second one) for various info. The interviews on the program's page are a bit lacking. If you, or someone you know, are a student/ex-student, or know of better methods to find such people, please let me know in the comments.\n\nI want to really get the best out of this great opportunity.\n\nEdit: also I just now remembered in some Scandinavian countries uni students get paid a little. Is this the case for Sweden? And do only Swedish nationals get this? Or is it merit-based?\n\nEdit2: checked and seems I'm not eligible to student grants, unless I find a job there (difficult because covid), someone in my family works there, or I have a permanent residence permit.",

    "postText": "Hi)  \nI'm thinking between ICT bachelor program at KTH and \"Computer science\" bachelors at other universities (in the Netherlands).\n\nI would like to work as a embedded system software engineer after graduation. I am not sure about if this program will be suitable for me, because most subjects in its cirriculum are rather about hardware and networks than about software developing and coding.\n\nI amn't sure if my assumption is right. That is why I would be really glad to tell students who study in ICT bachelor program.\n\nWhat do you think I'm right or not? Is this program suitable if you want to become a software developer?\n\nThank you in advance.",

            "comment": "Hello!\n\nI did the ICT Bachelor at KTH and I am now doing a Masters of Embedded Systems at KTH. \n\nThe ICT Bachelor includes a almost the full spectrum of what you can imagine would fit under \u201cInformation and Communication Technology\u201d\n\nIt included Java programming, functional programming, some digital design (gate logic), computer hardware architecture (processor, memory etc.) Operating systems (how Linux works internally), networks - the internet stack, algorithms and data structures and a whole plethora of math courses.\n\nThe only thing that imo was missing was a database (SQL) course and maybe web design, but I find web stuff really boring so I did not mind.\n\nI should note that the math courses are quite hard and require a lot of preparation before exam when compared to the more CS courses.\n\nAfter finishing the bachelor I actually got a job working with not exactly \u201cembedded systems\u201d, but low level firmware programming for sensor devices.\n\nI think the C programming that is taught in the computer architecture course and OS course is more than enough, to find work in the embedded systems field.\n\nThere is also a modern software design course that has a detailed look into Agile ans Scrum stuff, if your into that.\n\nI cant really comment on the Embedded Systems master as I have only recently started.\n\nHope this helps!",

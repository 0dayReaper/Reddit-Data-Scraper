    "postText": "So I got the acceptance letter for masters in Technology based Entrepreneurship at KTH however after seeing the management department I was very disappointed. The video hardly says anything about management and it shows mostly engineering labs. Also the masters program isn't even ranked. And it seems to be fairly new. In addition I failed to secure a scholarship. \n\nI am a startup founder and I wish to gain valuable connections and a foundation in Entrepreneurship as a subject. Is the masters program worth it?",

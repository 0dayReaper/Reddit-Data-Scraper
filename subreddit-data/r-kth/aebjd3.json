    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'd like to study in the ICT Bachelor from August 2019.\n\nAs a french student, I'll apply during the secound application round, and I was asking myself about the requirement, mainly grades.\n\nI've heard about the \"Merit rating\", what's the required one which I could hope to go to KTH with ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

The page seems to only exist in Swedish. It's been a while, so I'm afraid I can't really tell what they mean, especially for a foreign student.\n\nThese links may have some useful info:\n\nhttps://www.studera.nu/startpage/  \nhttps://www.studera.nu/startpage/road-to-studies/admission-to-university-studies/admissions-statistics/  \nhttps://www.uhr.se/en/start/  ",

Kolumnerna visar antagningspo\u00e4ng f\u00f6r den sist antagna i varje urvalsgrupp. V\u00e4rdet varierar fr\u00e5n termin till termin, beroende p\u00e5 antal platser och de s\u00f6kandes meriter.\n\nGoogle-traslated (because I'm lazy):\n\n&gt; The table shows what was required for previous semesters on the education. The columns show admission points for the last adopted in each selection group. The value varies from semester to semester, depending on the number of places and the applicants' qualifications.",

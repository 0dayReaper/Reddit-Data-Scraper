    "postText": "I'm currently in my last year of the aerospace engineering degree in Spain and I was thinking about doing my MSc somewhere in Europe and Sweden seemed nice. \n\nThe thing is I was looking at KTH and found two MSc that caught my interest, the Electromagnetics, Fusion and Space Engineering and the Aerospace engineering one. I saw that the Aerospace engineering one had 20% admision rate while the Electromagnetics one had an 80%. Is this something related to the difficulty of the Electromagnetics MSc difficulty or is it because it is not that good? I have many doubts because honestly I don't know nothing about fusion, but I do intend to have a future in the space industry.\n\nIf someone has previously taken or is currently in this MSc I would be grateful for any kind of advice. :)",

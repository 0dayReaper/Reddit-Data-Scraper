    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m currently doing my undergrad in Electrical Engineering (plus a minor in Business Analytics), at the National University of Singapore. I have been offered a place at KTH for student exchange (starting Jan 2022). \n\nI have some questions regarding the course offerings at KTH - especially whether anything is taught in English, cause I read that most courses for Year 1/2 are in Swedish :0\n\nIt also wouldn\u2019t hurt to make some friends beforehand! Do PM me if you have a few mins to spare \ud83d\ude03",

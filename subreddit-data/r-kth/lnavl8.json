    "postText": "Hi! \n\nI should do an erasmus in KTH soon, and I'm choosing my modules. I have done a first selection but I wonder how it goes if two courses take place at the same time? I think it can happen while I simulated my selection on the schedule of this year and there are many conflicts. Will it be the same next year?\n\nHave your experienced that? Can we catch up with the class? \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "Hi Lead-Free. I'm a US masters student in computer science. My advice to anybody coming from the USA considering KTH is whether they have a specific reason to coming to school at KTH that is not education related. For example, a spouse who is Swedish, family is Swedish, Swedish work etc, want to live in Sweden, etc.\n\nMy experience here at KTH has been that the education is not on par with that of the US school system. I went to US News Ranked National University in the top 50 and its 1000% not on par with that. I also went to a decent but not great community college and I would say I got more out of my education at the CC. In fact, I don't even think KTH is accredited by the US\n\nThis is an education that Europeans and Swedes are getting for free and thus the calibre of the education is what you would expect to get for free. I'm paying full international tuition and if I could do it again I wouldn't do it. \n\nAs for your original question, I would say very very few international students come from english-as-a-first-language speaking countries.  I would say most of them know how to speak english, but this is definitely as a second language and it comes across as such. As for the Chinese, of which they are the most plentiful among international students, sometimes I even doubt some of their ability to speak english at all. I'm pretty sure the only english speaking country in the top 10 countries represented by international students is the USA,  of which there are very few people.\n\nThe courses taught at the masters level are in English but the teachers are mostly speaking english as a second language. So don't expect it to be a seamless transition. I've only had one teacher that actually spoke english as a first language and he only taught a few classes. The others have all been by not native english speakers and it is not easy to understand them. Both in understanding their pronunciation, but also what they're saying. They often use words in the wrong way or completely make up new words to convey what they want to say which would otherwise be more sensible in their native tongue. \n\nAs an American, if I could redo it, I would stay away to be honest. If I were from somewhere where the education level was below Sweden sure. But not the US. American universities are better in my opinion, not by a little. A lot.\n\nFurthermore, my assessment of the professors at KTH are that they are not interested in teaching, the students, or even seem like they want to be there and also not good at teaching. Versus a top U.S. university where the teachers are interested IN YOU as a student/person, what you are doing with your life, your future and generally speaking, much more enthusiastic about teaching and passing on the torch.",

KTH is still a QS top-100 uni, and from what I've seen coming there from another (admittedly much worse) European school, the courses were much more interesting in Sweden.\n\nI think they also collaborate with MIT on research, so I'd be surprised if they weren't \"accredited by the US\".\n\nJust surprised since I found the few courses I took there very interesting, even if not always that challenging.",

                            "comment": "Hi EUWBDD, in addition to the things I've mentioned above: The professors are definitely unwilling to help beyond very short answers in between class breaks. They will generally pass the buck onto the \"teachers assistants\", who then pass the buck onto... your teammates. From my experience, the entire system at KTH, in general, is set up to provide as little *individual* help as possible. The mindset is typically, \"if I help you, then I must help everybody, and I can't do that\". As you start dealing with the school, you will notice a pattern. If you have a question, they want to be as uninvolved as possible. They will refer you to a link (which almost never answers your question or does so inadequately) or ask you to watch \"the webcast\". When I first came to KTH, I drank the kool-aid on their emphasis on the team projects. I looked at it as a great way to meet people and be collaborative. And while it generally is, I now believe the main reason is so that the school can outsource the teaching to the students. I don't know how many times I've gone the route of asking the teacher, getting handed off to the assistant, and then the assistant gives me the \"ask your group\" hand-to-the-face. And then when you ask your group, it is a hodgepodge of guessing, looking up resources from other universities, the internet (red-flag) and plagiarism off other groups and the web.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to integrate and make friends with the Swedish society. Sweden is generally a closed society. If you are an international student, most of your friends will be other international students. Sweden is not a society that is about helping you become the best that you can be. That is the United States. Sweden is neutral, in all aspects. If you have a question, or a problem, or something you want to do. You will generally find that people do not want to get involved with that. They don't want to take accountability or any sort of investment in what it is you're doing. Don't get me wrong, I love Sweden, the culture and the people, thats why I came here. But I would not recommend dropping $33k on the education unless there was some very specific reason why. If you are coming from a third world country or another country where the education is below that of Sweden, then sure, it will be a great step up. But if your choices are between Northwestern, UCLA, Emory, *insert any US University above ranking 100*, you should definitely go with the US School (unless there is a specific reason you want to be at KTH other than the education) in my opinion.\n\nAnd the courses are also not organized. In the USA, typically, your classes will be at a specific time and place every week. At KTH, the courses are completely butt-fuck random, every single week. Both in time and place! This is supremely frustrating because it makes picking your classes impossible. For example, let's say you're registered for CS101. The classes for any particular week may be Tuesday at 2pm at Q33, Wednesday at 8am at F1, and Friday at 10am at V1.   Then the next week it will be at Monday and Tuesday at 8am at M2.   Every week is completely different. This is absolutely retarded, and every class is like this. So how do you pick your classes? I honestly still don't fucking understand. It's utterly retarded. Also, (some teachers) lock the rooms if you're late. For example, this past semester, we were having classes at Room A and Room B, and it seemed to have a pattern. One day I went to room A at the scheduled time and it was a completely different class. I went to the wrong class because they switched it up again. So I start walking to Room B, the only other classroom we've been in all semester, when, I do some digging as I'm walking there and it's in some completely random building/room that we haven't been in all year. I finally make it there about 10 minutes late and the professor has already locked the fucking classroom. The whole system makes no sense. KTH is a disaster of a school if you ask me...\n\nAnyways, back to picking your classes. When you pick your classes, you're just going to have to live with the inevitability that you will not even be able to go to them because more than likely they will overlap due to random scheduling they do. So now you're paying $8,000 per semester for an education where you can't even go to all the classes. After a few weeks into the semester, most students aren't even going to class anyway because they are so bad. The teachers don't speak english as a native language, the assignments and resources are typically plagiarized from OTHER schools, you have very little resource, and there's no 'school' atmosphere like there is in the US. Sure there is the Nymble at KTH that throws some cool parties and there are job fairs on campus, but there is no KTH Pride, the school doesn't have a passionate alumni network, so does it actually even help your chances of getting a job in Stockholm? Who knows. There's definitely 0 upside of having your resume say KTH somewhere in the US.",

I won't go into detail because there are already responses to enitsv's post detailing more or less what I would say.\nOverall, I've had a great experience at KTH and would recommend /have recommended it to friends back home.",

    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI'm planning to apply for a Ph.D. program at KTH and wanted to ask about the stipend rates and how much are Ph.D. students able to save in a month? I hear that the salary is around 30k SEK. After taxation, it reduces to around 22k-23.5k SEK per month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOut of this, how much is spent on:\n\nRent?\n\nTransportation?\n\nFood &amp; Living? (Assume that leisure is at a bare minimum and a teetotaler who doesn't eat pork/beef)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks and regards.",

Note that students get 10k a month in Sweden, and can live on it if very frugal and living in a student corridor (3-4k).\n\nUsually takes some time queue time to get an student apartment (say 1 year). And during that time you might have to pay 10-12k for hiring an apartment privately.",

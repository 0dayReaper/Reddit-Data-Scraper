    "postText": "Hello,\nI've taken 5 courses here now (exchanging for masters), and I've been floored at how easy, unprofessional, and arbitrary these courses are. Readings quizzes have been poorly written with \"was this a direct quote from the book???\" questions, or the even better True/False \"did you read the textbook like we told you to\" questions, across three courses. Students seem incentivized not to attend lecture because they are generally way too basic or irrelevant to any sort of assessment. My recitations? The TAs don't even have the solution guide to the recitations much less any idea of what the answers are. They don't even know how to get to the answer when students ask questions. Grading is also often completely arbitrary. I had a quantitative rubric in only one class for one project. My other projects, except for one class, were assigned grades randomly, with no target set when announcing the project, so we had no idea of even how ambitious we should be. The bar doesn't appear to be very high, as I've gotten all A's so far on everything without much work, but I think that's due to randomness more than my own competence. I'm sure this CAN'T be the experience that most students are having, even if it is the experience I have had consistently. Thank goodness other students are nice here.\n\nIs there any course evaluation? Does anything happen on account of them?\n/endrant",

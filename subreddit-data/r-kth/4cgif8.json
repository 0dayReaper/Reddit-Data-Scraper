I don't speak Swedish, would that hurt my chances of getting a part time job? And how about housing? Possible to get a cheap-ish apartment close to the University. \n\nAny help is greatly appreciated!",

The Housing is not going to be cheap whatever you do, and it's a djungle of second hand contracts that you need to navigate yourself through. On the part-time job front it's not as bad, but it depends on what kind of job you'd want to have. The service jobs are a bit more reliant on Swedish, but almost everyone everywhere in Sweden speaks english so I bet you'd be able to find something.",

There are rooms available for rent for less, but they're often very far from the school. Unless you're attending the campuses in Kista or Flemingsberg, it's a lot cheaper out there.",

Perhaps it could be a bit of problem if the job involves dealing directly with consumers. Tech companies, however, don't seem to mind it at all, and for them it would probably be a bigger problem if you didn't speak English.\n\nHousing in Stockholm is a *disaster*. Obviously a lot of people come here to study, and things work out for them somehow, but in order to rent a flat on the mainstream rental market you probably have to queue for about 7 years.",

Bus and commuter trains should get you to and from the city.\n\nThe commute shouldn't take more than 1-1.5h in worst case. If you miraculously manage to find something in the city it shouldn't be more than 20-30mins.\n\nAs I said in my previous comment the traffic isn't exactly cheap. A ticket for 90 days costs ~$190 plus ~$2 for a bus card (one time fee).\n\nSpeaking of housing; I can recommend [SSSB](SSSB.se) for housing. They rent apartments to students and have a considerable shorter queue than apartments in general in Stockholm. One should be able to get something within a year of queuing. To be in their queue you must however be a member of a student association in Stockholm. [THS](ths.KTH.se) is the one associated with KTH.",

I'm also meh at linear algebra. \n\nThe course was split into 5 assignments (you do them on your own and turn them in) where you built neural networks from scratch, most people used MatLab or Python. The neural networks increased in complexity with each assignment. \n\nAfter these assignments came a group project where you were you could choose what your neural network was supposed to do, in the group project you could use frameworks (i.e. how stuff is done outside of uni).\n\nThe workload was heavy, but rewarding. The course focused heavily on the math behind deep learning, primarily image recognition but also some text prediction. \n\nFor me, and those I knew also taking the course, the lectures were hard to follow. They focused heavily on the details (several blackboards filled with matrix calculations), however when doing the assignments things became more clear. \n\nThe assignments &amp; project are doable even if you don't fully understand the math, however you have to have some grasp of it.\n\nIf you have previous experience with ML and good math foundation then I recommend the course, however if you are looking for something a bit more introductory / general then it might be a bit on the heavy side.\n\n\nLet me know if there is anything else you want to know, happy to help",

Or is it just assignments and the group project?\n\nTwo last questions:\n\n\u2022 how's the professor? I mean, is she approachable and friendly or is she more on the rough and high horse side?\n\u2022 how many people usually attended the classes? Is it one of those courses with a huge amount of students?",

You were given lots of hints on how it was supposed to work though. I took some print screens of the first assignment [here](https://imgur.com/a/2fudtQZ) if you're interested. This is from 2019, so it might be different now.\n\n &gt;Is there also a final theoretical exam? Or is it just assignments and the group project?\n\nIn 2019 there was only the assignments &amp; group project. \n\nIf you look at the course page on the KTH website you might find some information https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2424?l=en\n\nCourse plan here https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/kursplan/DD2424-20191.pdf?lang=en\n\n\n&gt; how's the professor? I mean, is she approachable and friendly or is she more on the rough and high horse side? \n\nI think she is approachable and friendly, however I did not try to approach her all that much so I really can't say.\n\n&gt;how many people usually attended the classes? Is it one of those courses with a huge amount of students?\n\nIt's on the larger side for sure. Maybe 100-200 participants? Can't recall a more exact number",

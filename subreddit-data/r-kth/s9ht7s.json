    "postText": "Hey there. I'm a student applying for [M.Sc](https://M.Sc) in Aerospace Engineering at KTH. KTH demands a summary sheet with ECTS credits and a list of courses in math and mechanics. However, the contents of a particular KTH math course in my university are spread across various courses. Do I then, simply just mention all of these courses where my ECTS credits are asked for?",

The total number of credits offered over these 4 years is 210, with 120 required to graduate/receive a degree.\n\nThe credit system isn't set in stone throughout the country, and the universities don't really give us a metric to convert our credits into ECTS ones. The credits themselves aren't equally divided over the years either, some years have a total of 54 to offer whereas others offer around 52 or so. I think that is why KTH wants us to calculate our ECTS based on the average credits acquired per year?",

The form also mentions an indian University example with a similar number of credits required to graduate (128). \n\nNevertheless, I've mailed them about the same, just to be sure.

I simply had to add up the total, which was way too high. But I guess they understand that.",

The biggest ones are probably bostad.stockholm.se, sssb.se and maybe even k2a.se.\n\nIf people are offering to rent their place, they sometimes don't have the official permission to do so and they know it, so make sure to ask them if you will be able to officially register at the address with Skatteverket (the tax agency). \n\nFinding an appartement in Stockholm as an international student is hard! I went through it last year and it honestly sucked. My advice is to rather go with more expensive places that are definitely legit (housing queues) rather that an appartement from blocket. As soon as you have about 200 days on sssb (90 of those can be from before uni starts) it will be relatively easy to find appartements for 3000-4000kr on sssb so just bite your time. \n\nI lived in the Unity Kista Campus for a while. It is kinda expensive (7200kr a month) and loads of problems but it is legit and the have free appartements most of the time. \n\nI wish you the best of luck!",

The rooms are pretty small (15m^2) with a massive bathroom that takes up alot of space. They are pretty nice but honestly not worth it for the price if you want to stay there for years. You should try to get one of the rooms that is on the end of a floor as they have 2 windows instead of one.\n\nAll the extra stuff they offer is pretty ok. You have to give a 3 month notice period when you leave though, which is kinda annoying. \n\nHope that helps! If you have any more questions, it's probably best if you just message me privately.",

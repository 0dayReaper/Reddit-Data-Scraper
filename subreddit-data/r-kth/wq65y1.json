    "postText": "Hi guys\n\nI'm currently trying to decide to which universities I will apply for a master's for the year 2023-24, and KTH has been on my mind - MSc in Embedded Systems in particular. The problem does seem very nice.  However, one thing that I'd like to do is to be more involved in investigation or some sort of work with professors/researchers, maybe even co-authoring some scientific papers. I know that in some universities this is common to do. Others have some sort of Honours Program which provides these opportunities to the students who most want it. I couldn't find anything relevant regarding apprenticeship grants nor anything like that, for example, but maybe it's me that's not searching for the correct words.\n\nCan you tell me if this is something possible/common to do? Thanks!",

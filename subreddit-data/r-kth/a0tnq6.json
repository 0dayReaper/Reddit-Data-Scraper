    "postText": "Hi all! One of the requirements to the MSc Sustainable Technology course is to submit a thesis proposal (~500 words). I\u2019ve found some good online resources on how to structure and how to write them, however, I\u2019m finding it somewhat hard to pin down what exactly I could propose as a potential thesis. \n\nTherefore, I\u2019m curious to know your take on some concerns I have:\n\n(1) Does the thesis proposal have to be original? \n\n(2) Considering I\u2019m capped to 500 words, what are the most important/relevant things to include in the proposal? \n\n(3) If you\u2019ve written a thesis proposal in the past, how did you go on about figuring out what exactly you wanted to write about? \n\nI found an information sheet about the thesis proposal on the KTG website but I found it rather vague, so I\u2019ll immensely appreciate any inputs from you. Guess I\u2019m just a tad unsure where and how I should start. \n\nCheers!",

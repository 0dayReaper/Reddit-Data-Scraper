Is there anyone who attended and wants to share thoughts about it? \nI'm currently studying Biomedical Engineering (Bachelor) in Poland, my specialisation is Biomedical Computer Science, but I've decided to change the major - I'm thinking of studying something connected with User Experience.",

            "comment": "Hi! I am attending the first year of the master right now, as part of a five year program in engineering in media technology. I have not experienced all the mandatory courses yet and I might be doing the visual media path, but the ones I\u00b4ve had have been very interesting. I am not sure I have anything of value to say specifically about the physical interaction path haha. I think the path might be of interest if you kind of like a little bit of everything and HCI, not only hardcore computer stuff and coding. The teachers and professors are mostly from different backgrounds and areas and I think the programme as a whole is not too niched, if you know what I mean. You get a wide range of subjects to choose from in the elective courses which is nice.\n\nWishing you good luck in your education!",

I will try to write shortly about them. Sorry if it is not that good, I am really not great describing stuff like this haha.\n\nI thought human perception was really interesting since it evolved around the brain and how the way we interact is actually influenced by biology and phypsiology. It also had a quite big project were we did a research thing that related to what a PHD-student was working on. That was nice as a preparation for future master thesis.\n\nThe multimodal course had us learning about different modalities and how they are implemented in what we use. We got to test haptics, sound interaction, VR/AR, etc., and explore how these are combined. This course also had a project were we got to choose modalities to implement in some way and then do some kind of research on it. My group did AR and proprioception, which we put in an AR-application made with Unity.\n\nI did some other unrelated courses too which is why these are the only specific ones to the master program. Overall I think they fit right into what I had expected from the program. Currently I am doing a course in sustainability and ICT, which is elective. So there really is a wide range of different subjects and areas to touch upon.\n\nBest regards to you!",

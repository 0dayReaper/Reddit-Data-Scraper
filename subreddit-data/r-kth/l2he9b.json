    "postText": "Hi Everyone, Like many others here, I am a non Swedish student submitted an application to a MSc (Engineering Mechanics). I submitted all my documents and was a little weirded out by how this program only required the basic general documents and the program specific summary sheet. I put this concern on the back burner until I saw a few other applications post here (Machine learning applicants) and took a glance at the requirements and noticed personal statements, Portfolios, and CVs... the whole 9 yards.\n\nI find it a bit strange that programs like Engineering Mechanics or Engineering Physics seem to be less stringent but I'm assuming it could be:\n\n**1) Class size capacity**\nMaybe some programs have more professors and can take more students in per semester? or labs are of a certain size?\n\n**2)Popularity of majors**\nThis  makes sense to me since certain majors like vehicle design and medical bio-technical engineering are \"Sexier\" more sought-after specialties than us lowly Sound and Vibration Engineers /s maybe Engineering Mechanics just has less applicants in general...\n\n\nanyone have other guesses?",

In general the institutions at KTH have a large amount of freedom, so in this case they could be allowed to set up and gather the information they feel is most fitting depending on their circumstances (which probably include the two reasons you have given).",

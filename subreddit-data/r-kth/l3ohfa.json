    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm applying for Entrepreneurship and innovation management masters program in KTH now, I have 2 inquiries:\n\n1. Does \"free accommodation\" means I have to pay nothing and rent is included in program fees? or it's just the university will support in finding a place in Stockholm?\n2. Regarding the recommendation letters, should it be academic recommendations or business recommendations?\n\nThank you.",

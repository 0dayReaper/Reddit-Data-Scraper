I am considering du'bo for my PhD in the future. Which of these two schools is stronger in the academic area of my mentioned major? Which one is more conducive to a PhD?",

            "comment": "Short answer is that Paris-Saclay would be a better choice as the university is nearly six times bigger than KTH and thus the total research output is larger. France is also bigger than Sweden, and you are likely to have more job opportunities there.\n\nHOWEVER, if you want to do a PhD, rankings or size doesn't matter at all, and you should look at the potential research groups you want to work with in each university in order to take a proper decision. Some very small universities have stellar researchers in their fields, for example.",

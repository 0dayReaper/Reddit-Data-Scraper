    "postText": "I got admitted to both the Machine Learning at KTH and the IT and Cognition course at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. I am interested in cognition and applying ML to medical data, CV and medical imaging. I am unsure which one should I go for since both courses/universities seem very good. Copenhagen vs Stockholm? Also which uni has a better reputation/connections and research labs? IT and cognition seem more specialised than ML, thus I might be shutting some doors to myself. What would you go for?",

    "postText": "Hello, I have been looking at this MSc Software Engineering of Distributed Systems.\n\nI like the sounds of the course. The modules seem right up my alley.\n\nThe thing is, I have never really liked college. But, I want to give it a proper try again, and I want to nerd out and meet new tech people. \n\nI have heard that KTH is more relaxed (less intense) and practical then other universities, which honestly sounds great. I want time to be able to research my own interests in distributed systems and CS, and so this sounds good. I dont really care about grades. I just want to maximize my learning (particularly practical learning) and meet new people.\n\nI was trying to find web sites (forums,etc) to ask questions about the course. Its a Swedish university, and so I suspect I need Swedish websites/forums (which I am finding hard to find) ;) any forums / q&amp;a's I should check out?\n\nI just wanted to find out how intensive it was. What student life is like, etc. \n\nAnybody who has has experience or can direct me to Swedish forums?\n\nThanks",

One option is to contact here https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/software-engineering-distributed-systems/ask-us-about-studies-1.843723\n\nUsually there's also an option to contact a student but it seems that there's no assigned student and the programansvariga can answer questions about the content and maybe redirect you to other people that can answer your remaining questions.",

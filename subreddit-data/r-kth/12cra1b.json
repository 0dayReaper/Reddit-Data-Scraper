But what is really weird is the fact that only 6 people were accepted in a degree so vast as Electric Power Engineering. \nMy question, besides the \u201cdo I have good chances of getting accepted?\u201d, is:\nWhy did they only accepted 6 people. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nMy University Admissions account says:\n\nYou've been placed on a waiting list in the following selection groups:\nstudieavgiftsbefriade (BEFR)\nYour waiting list number in this selection group is 3\nThe number of applicants who have been offered a place in this selection group is 6\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014",

The other students are from other selection groups, like those who need to pay a fee. (Don't know your chance at being accepted)",

    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI want to study at KTH in a future, particularly the Renewable Energy Master's Programme. But I don't know if I would be able to apply for it by studying the Bachelor's Programme of Information and Communication Technology. Would I be able to apply for it or should I take another Bachelor in something like Electrical Engineering or other thing?\n\nThe thing is that I want to specialize all I can in Renewable Energy so I can help the environment, but I don't know where to begin at all.\n\nThank you!",

I checked it and it says that I need a completed Bachelor equivalent to 180 ECTS and that it should be related with something like mechanic, chemistry, electricity, electronics or energy. And it says that in all cases knowledge in the principles of economic sciences are appreciated.\n\nSo I understood that I can't apply for it with a Bachelor in Information and Communication Technology, right?",

    "postText": "Hello, I wanted to ask if anyone knows what kind of grades are needed to get into KTH? I am interested in applying but cant seem to find any info for finnish/international students on what kind of grades they need to get in, or what kind of report cards apply (SATs, A-levels etc.). If anyone can help give reference points or any source that shows recommended grades I would be very thankful. Thank you!",

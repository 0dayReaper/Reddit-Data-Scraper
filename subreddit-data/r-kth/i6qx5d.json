    "postText": "Hey, I checked the requirements for applying to KTH to MSc Aerospace and it requires 25ECTS of higher programming languages. I have done about that in my course, however I really want to stay as far away from IT as possible.\n\nTherefore I'd like to know how much programming/software do you actually do during the masters? And can I opt for subjects related to mechanics perhaps?",

Better get used to it if you want to be an engineer in the 21st century. It\u2019s not really IT work, more like using a glorified graphing calculator like MATLAB to run models or some scripting language like python to crunch through some engineering data sets.",

Some of the courses I've taken involve some basic commercial FEM/CFD programming (ansys classic, blueCFD) but usually they give you a brief introduction which is more than enough to get through the assignments.\n\nI'd say get comfortable with MATLAB (or python etc.) though because most courses at KTH which involve any kind of calculations will utilize it. The main focus of the program is not programming, but it is a tools that is used when needed the same way you'd use a calculator.",

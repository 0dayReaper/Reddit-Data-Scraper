    "postText": "Hey so I\u2019m applying for fall 2020 and I was looking into the research work done at KTH in EECS and I\u2019m very confused.\nFirstly how do the divisions (communication systems, information science and engineering or network systems and engineering) play in with regards to our masters degree?\nCommunications systems has some great research going on in radio systems lab and network systems lab. I have worked on cognitive radio and spectrum sensing using game theory at a v beginner level under my college professor but I\u2019m v keen on that. At the same time I\u2019m not ready to completely dissociate from 5G and future network architecture and protocols.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a research oriented career. My masters will probably be followed by doctoral studies. Considering all of this, can someone guide me?",

            "comment": "First thing I want to mention is that your interests align well with what KTH is world known for. They have close collaborations with companies such as Ericsson and there are tons of opportunities if you want to learn more about those collaborations.\n\nHowever, it is important to know that master studies at KTH are different to what some expect. Out of 120 credits over the course 2 years and 4 semesters, 90 credits are reserved for courses. These courses are taken for 1.5 years, and the last half year is reserved for writing a thesis corresponding to 30 credits. Usually, some of the courses are freely electible, but the majority of courses are obligatory. You can read about every single course on the webpage of [master(1)](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/communication-systems/course-overview-1.268645) and [master(2)](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/information-and-network-engineering/courses-1.673889).\n\nWhat this means, is that research exposure and networking with academia generally only happens for the last half year. Unless you actively seek out professors and other faculty to discuss course content, or manage to get a rare research assistant position, you will have no connection to any faculty.\n\nThis means two things:\n\n* First, you should pick master solely based on the course content. All courses given by EECS are available to any student of an EECS master, meaning that you can, within the limits of your freely electible courses, pick any course from another master or undergraduate program. The communication division might give more courses for the Communications Systems program, which is a way to network with people from that division. But you will not be formally connected to any division.\n* The second thing, is that it will require you some active work in preparation for PhD studies. Applying to grad school usually demands not only high grades but excellent references from 2-3 professors and often work published in journals or presented at conferences. It will be your responsibility of achieving this, and when grad school applications are due, you will likely not even have received an advisor for your thesis yet.\n\nI'm in the computer science master, so I can't offer any advice as to which master suits you best. It sounds like you might have a preference for communications systems, and if that is the case then maybe you should pick that master and opt for the internetworking track. My point is that you get what you make of it. You will not be limited by any choice you make and, if you are ambitious, you will find professors that are more than keen on helping you prepare for a future career in academia.\n\nGood luck with applications!",

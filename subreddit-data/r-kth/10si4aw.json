    "postText": "Hi everybody!\n\nI applied to ICT at KTH last year and got in with a merit rating of 22.4, but I also got in to TU Delft and a university in my country, the University of Warsaw. I decided to not accept my place at KTH so that perhaps somebody else could get in. After struggling and ultimately failing to find a place to live in the Netherlands, I decided to study computer science in Warsaw.\n\nRight now, I think studying here is not really working out for me, so I decided to apply to ICT again for fall 2023. \n\nIf anybody could help me at least a bit and tell me about the pace of study, the courses and even living in Sweden in general, I would be really grateful.",

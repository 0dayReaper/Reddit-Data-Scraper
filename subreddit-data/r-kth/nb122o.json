    "postText": "Hello,  \nI'm currently in my 2nd year of Batchelor's study in Serbia, and I would like to apply next year for Engineering Mechanics Master at KTH( starting in summer 2022). I am a bit confused because right now, on the website it states that the only required specific document is the summary sheet. Is it true that you don't apply with your CV and full motivation letter( apart from the 1500 character one in the summary sheet)? Apart from that, how difficult is it to get selected into the course?  \nThank you for your time.",

    "postText": "Hej everyone! \n\nI'm currently in my third year of studying a bachelor's in geography (with a concentration in urban studies), and I have a few questions regarding the admission process, as well as the program itself. \n\nFirstly, for a program like urban planning at KTH, how competitive is the admission? How difficult is it to get into the program? and what would be my best course of action to improve my chances of admission? \n\nSecondly, if any of you are in the program, what are your thoughts on it? have you enjoyed it? and do you feel as if it is leading you in the correct direction? \n\ntack :) ",

I happen to study at the degree programme in Civil Engineering and Urban Management (bachelor plus master), at which one can choose to study urban planning (I'm personally not as I'm going into Civil Engineering, but I know people who study Urban planning :) )\n\nAs of what I've heard from my friends who study Urban Planning, they find it amazing. If you PM me I'll do my best to tell you more tomorrow when I'm not as tired and drunk as I'm right now ;)",

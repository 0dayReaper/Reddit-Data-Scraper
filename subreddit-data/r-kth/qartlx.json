    "postText": "Hello! I'm a senior in university who is currently studying computer science in the United States. I've always been interested in human-computer interaction and the Interactive Media Technology program at KTH looks very cool. \n\nThe one thing about the program that scares me is how open-ended it seems. It seems to be ideal for someone who knows exactly what kind of job or research they want to pursue after their masters. I'm still kind of figuring that out for myself. I really like design, data science, and computer vision/machine learning. For that reason, I'm not sure if it would be better to apply to a more focused program in one of these disciplines, such as the Computer Science MSc which allows you to specialize in a certain area. \n\nFor anyone who is in the program, can you tell me how it is going for you? Do you like the program, and what do you not like about it? What do you wish to do after graduation? Any advice for someone like me who is applying? :-)",

As most of my taken courses are focused on engineering fields, I was not able to form a well-made professional portfolio as the art students with my side projects. Wonder if that disadvantage would matter in the application process...",

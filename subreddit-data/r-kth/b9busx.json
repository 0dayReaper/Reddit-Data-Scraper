    "postText": "Hej!\n\nSo I had applied to KTH and their Masters programme in Physics and I have been placed on a waitlist with a reserve number of 1. Apparently I have a summary sheet missing and I am not able to figure out if I should mail the programme co-ordinator with a filled sheet. \n\nMeanwhile, I was also told by a friend that there may be a second round of admission decisions but I couldn't find any statement of the sort on KTH's website. I am really anxious and I would be grateful if someone could tell me what would be the best thing to do here! \n\n",

            "comment": "There is second admission cycle for late applications, which has nothing to do with the first cycle and thus does not concern your application. It is probably best if you contact the program coordinator. Every program has one academic coordinator (a professor) and one administrative coordinator that handles practical stuff such as course selection. I suggest you write a mail with your question to the academic coordinator, who is responsible for the admission decision and put the administrative coordinator in CC. You should be able to find their names and email addresses on the program information page. Usually they are very responsive and happy to help.\n\nGood luck with your application!",

This is my first choice school and it has certainly started to work me up haha. I did mail the prigramme director with the missing documents and stuff. Hoping to hear back soon.\n\nSuper grateful for your response though! Thanks a tonne again!",

If you've sent your transcript of grades and all, you should be fine, document wise.\n\nAnd yes there is another round after people who ere accepted actually accept the place offer or not.\n\nNow about the waitlist, dam, that must be tough to be the first on the line. Well, in Sweden people usually apply to many schools and just choose between the options they had, so it's really likely that, by any reason, one person of the accepted will choose to study somewhere else, really. \n\nBesides, if you're not lucky and don't get the place, being first on the waiting list means you have what it takes to get in, so don't worry, you can get in during the spring intake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Fucking hell I have spent the whole damn night cursing myself mate. \n\nBut thank you so much for the reassurance! I will wait for the other round then. I was also considering to make an appeal. Don't know how good or bad that would be. I hope someone gets to go some place better! I really hope to make it lol. Front of the line is a bad place to be in for sure haha.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I am an international student from India and I have recently received admission from KTH for MS in Aerospace and want to pursue the Aeronautics track. I have also received admit in ISAE SUPAERO and TU Delft and would like to know how well the aerospace masters in KTH compares to these uni's which are considered especially good in the field. \n\nI am specifically interested to do research in aerodynamics and planning to pursue a phD in the future, it would be helpful if I can get some inputs on how well KTH would equip me for this.\n\nCheers!",

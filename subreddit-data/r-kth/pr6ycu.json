    "postText": "Hello! \nRecently I started thinking about the next step of my academic career (currently bachelor\u2019s Data Science at Warsaw University of Technology) and I came across masters in Distributed Systems at KTH. It looks great on paper but maybe some of you has any insight into the educational quality of the course in compare to e.g Machine Learning/Computer Science? I know that newborn programs sometime need additional time to develop well-suited set of courses. Any opinions?\n\nThanks!",

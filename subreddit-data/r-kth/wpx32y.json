They usually set pretty straight the rules for attendance, submissions, bonus points and exams.\nAdditional tip: there usually are a lot of small projects throughout the period, for which the help of professors or teaching assistants can be crucial. It can be useful to go to some lectures to at least build some kind of relationship with them, it can be valuable when asking for help.",

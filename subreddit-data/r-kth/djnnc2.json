The general idea is that you as a student should propose what your thesis should be about. You should have been given information about all of this in the master thesis lecture in prosamm a few weeks ago. The information is also linked on canvas. Other than that, start talking to professors and/or companies to see if they have any ideas. Many companies list a few proposals somewhere on their website.",

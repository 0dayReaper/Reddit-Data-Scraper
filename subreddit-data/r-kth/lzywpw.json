    "postText": "Hi all! I am thinking of applying in order to study at KTH.   \n1) What is the deal with the two application waves? From what I have gathered because I am European and I am still in my last year of Sixth Form (High School Equivalent I believe), I have to apply in the second wave - is that correct?\n\n2) What are acceptance rates like? I am predicted AAAA at A-Levels if it helps for a rough estimation.\n\n3) What is the average pass rate to the second year? In the EU, the only other university I am applying to is TU Delft, and their pass is around 50%.\n\n4) Is the ICT Bachelor the same as Computer Science, or almost the same thing? In the UK, ICT and Computer Science are extremely different.\n\n5) How hard would it be to enrol in a Masters after (albeit in Sweden, or abroad)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you guys!",

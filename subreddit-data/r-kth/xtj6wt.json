    "postText": "Hoping someone here has been in the same following situation!!  \n\n\nI'm from South of India where it is a usual practice of placing first letter of father's name before his children' name. All my official documents except for passport state my name with an initial followed by name(eg. N Sudharsan) whereas in my passport it is expanded(eg. Sudharsan Neelamegam).   \n\n\nNow, what is the name that I should fill in my [universityadmissions.se](https://universityadmissions.se) profile? The one in passport - the expanded one or the one in others(initial followed by name). Following is a snippet from [universityadmissions.se](https://universityadmissions.se), I want someone to tell me what document should I produce to explain this?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zz7ggqldocr91.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8747d643c696c262f341f6e522b051577f57e503",

Is it easy/difficult? What about the Job opportunities after completion and how many years of work permit will be given?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould appreciate any information that would also benefit a person who is about to enter for their first year in Masters in this University.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks.",

Vehicle engineering is no exception in that regard, so finding work should be possible.\n\nRegarding visas, you can apply for an additional of 6 months to find work after your studies.

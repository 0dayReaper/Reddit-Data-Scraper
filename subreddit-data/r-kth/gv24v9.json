How is this programme at KTH now?\n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of studying in KTH?\n\nIt would be really helpful if an alumnus from this same programme at KTH could answer this.\n\nTBH, I want to study here but I see some reddit posts  that give a wrong idea about KTH and some tht support KTH.\n\nWhat should I do?",

Yeah, I would think it's good if you establish connections with the industry. If you plan on staying in Sweden after graduation though, I'd strongly recommend you learning swedish as I've heard it's been a deal breaker for some students looking for work.",

Thanks for your reply. Pls do reply again if you could tell more about the uni.",

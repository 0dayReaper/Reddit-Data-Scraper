    "postText": "Hej! I'm an Italian student (hopefully) about to graduate from Polytechnic of Milan in Automation engineering and I have applied at KTH for an M.Sc. in System, Control and Robotics.\nI have some questions and I'll try to be as schematic as possible:\n\n1) how realistic is it for a master's student to be able to live in Stockholm on his own means, without financial help? By that I mean to earn enough money to pay for rent, bills, etc., etc.\n\n2) what kind of jobs would be available to a student with a basic (I will start studying Swedish but I don't expect to reach even B1 by August) Knowledge of Swedish? I imagine that academical jobs and internships will be available in English but what about jobs like sales assistant, customer service, receptionist etc etc?\n\n3) what is the typical weekly workload? How many hours would I be expected to spend on lecturesojects and assignments? \n\n4) what areas of Stockholm would you advice?\n\n5) for who has attended this programme: which courses would you advice?\n\nThanks to everyone in advance :)",

            "comment": "1. Since you are an EU citizen you don't have to pay tuition fees so if you can find a way to earn around 10k kr/month you should be able to rent a corridor room (3000-4100 kr/month) and make ends meet. Most Swedish students live on 11k kr/month from CSN, the Swedish financial aid bureau.\n\n2. Almost none, especially these days due to the impact of the pandemic. You could work as a teaching assistant for masters courses but this would only be part-time with limited hours. Luckily these teaching assistant positions are quite easy to get for courses you have taken and passed, as long as you got a good grade. I know some students work as delivery bicyclists for food delivery companies but the pay is not very good. If you don't speak Swedish fluently (at least C1 level) then part-time unskilled labor positions are extremely difficult to get.\n\n3. Workload is very low at KTH in my experience. At least in my masters program a lot of the information was just repeated info from my bachelor, but even considering this the workload was only 20-30 hours per week most of the time, and up to 40 hours per week for stressful weeks. This is if you are aiming for the highest grades. If you aim to just pass the courses then the workload is even less. On top of this deadlines are not strict at all so you can simply turn your assignments in weeks or months late if you want to and still pass the course. \n\n4. Advice for what? \n\n5. I was in a different program so I cannot help here sorry.",

                    "comment": "I just want to add some nuance for your answer to number 3. I worked at least 35 hours per week my whole masters program at KTH and some weeks more. Some courses also had quite harsh repercussions for handing in assignments late. So I think the workload definitely varies depending on the master program. So do not count on a low workload.",

                            "comment": "Thank you for sharing your perspective. Funny enough my masters program (well the entire 5 year civilingenj\u00f6r technically, but almost everyone in the civilingenj\u00f6r program picked the master program I was in) supposedly had a reputation for being one of the most difficult and time consuming out of all the programs at KTH, at least according to my Swedish friends. But I still thought the workload was very little. I think its mostly just because where I am from the workload is much higher, typically 60-70 hours per week and we were expected to work on weekends as well with very limited free time during my bachelors. There were no omtentor like there is at KTH, if you didnt pass a tenta you just failed and had to take the class next year, or you could drop out. And only something like 50% of students even made it to the second year of the bachelor program, and then another 50% of them made it to the third year. So by comparison I think KTH was much more relaxing. But I think in general you are right, it highly depends on what master program you pick at KTH.\n\nI think it can be difficult to compare programs and workloads across different countries though. I think if you just compare to other master programs in engineering in Sweden KTH probably has a quite high workload due to the good reputation of the school.",

                                    "comment": "Obviously 35 hours is no where near a 60-80 hour workload and I do think that studying at KTH is very manageable, especially considering the ability to redo an exam if you fail or want a higher grade. But I do think it compares to a full time job. But like you said, it obviously depends on what master program you choose and if you are studying to pass or get straight As.",

I did school work and attended classes from 8:00-14:00 most days, unless I had a course after 14:00, and then I worked at my job from 14:30 to 18:00, unless I had a course during this time. In any case my hours for my job were flexible, I just needed to work 15-20 hours per week (note to the OP, this was not a job in Sweden, I worked remotely a company in my home country, but I had to pay taxes here in Sweden). I am not a EU citizen so I had to work longer hours than usual since I needed to pay both the tuition fees and pay for my rent, food, and things like this. But I think it is overall very manageable to work part time at KTH and also study full-time, even without sacrificing much free time.",

How many hours do teaching assistants work roughly? (Not that I have big hopes to land such a job)\n\n3. That's good news tbh, especially since what I heard from people at Chalmers (different uni, I know, but couldn't contact anyone from KTH yet) is that Swedish universities tend to demand an 8 to 5 everyday schedule+ overtime assignments and projects. Also on kth site it says that studying is considered a full time activity, thus working is not adviced\n\n4. Which areas would be better to stay in as a student\n\n5. No worries, thank you.",

                            "comment": "1. I have no idea, I am not Swedish so I am not eligible for student loans from CSN\n2. I think it depends. I didn't work as a teaching assistant but my friends who did worked something like 5-10 hours per week depending on the course.\n3. I'm very surprised to hear this about Chalmers. At KTH it isn't like this at all. In my experience from the Swedish friends I made most packed their bags and went home between 16:00 and 17:00 and didn't even really do work on weekends since weekends were seen to them as more of a time to relax and let loose. I think this is the right way to do things since you will have minimal stress and much more free time, but it is very different from where I am from where we were expected to put in 60-70 hours per week during our bachelors. By comparison the student life is much more relaxed here in Sweden.\n4. I think if you are planning to stay in student housing most of them are fine. Lappis is the largest student housing area but you could also consider kungshamra and the one by campus that I forgot the name of. All are in safe areas.",

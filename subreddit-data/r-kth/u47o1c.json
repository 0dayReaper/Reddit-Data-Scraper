    "postText": "Hello Everyone,\n\nHoping you and your loved ones are keeping up well.\n\nSo I got admitted to Masters in Renewable Energy offered by the EIT Innoenergy programme (which is basically co-funded by the European Union), and I will be starting off my first year in August 2022 at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. If in case anyone has graduated or you know someone who graduated with the same or a similar course from EIT, can you please help me with what the future prospects look like after graduation? Any other suggestions and do's and don'ts for a non-EU citizen are highly appreciated as well!",

So if you'd like to study at 2 schools, and have someone else do the paperwork for you, it's probably fine. But the innovation/business/entrepreneurship aspect is pretty weak, without as much industry involvement as I felt was marketed.",

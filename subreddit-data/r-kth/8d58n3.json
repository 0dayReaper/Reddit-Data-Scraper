    "postText": "Hi, I am currently a student in CS at Purdue University, Indiana and I am planning on living in Stockholm and continue my studies. I researched KTH and Purdue offers study abroad with KTH, though I don't want to attend the university as an exchange student. I can't seem to find anywhere an option to be an undergrad student studying CS. I am a citizen of EU if that counts for anything.\n\nThank you!",

Most undergraduate studies in Sweden are in Swedish, with few exceptions. Your only English option with KTH at this level is this program: https://www.kth.se/en/studies/bachelor/information-communication-technology\n",

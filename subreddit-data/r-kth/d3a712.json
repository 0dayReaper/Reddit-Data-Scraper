    "postText": "Hello, I want to apply for the Master in Machine learning for next year. I got stuck with the [specific requirements](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/machinelearning/entry-requirements-1.48539) as it is unclear to me how they verify the \"levels\" expected from your previous studies. For example, it is required a course in \"Probability and Statistics\" but I only did a course on \"Probability theory\". However, during the course we did some statistics (spent about 1/3 of the course there). Is it enough? Any clues on how they would compare the two?\n\nThis year I have the possibility to fill these gaps doing additional courses but I have to figure out which ones are needed.",

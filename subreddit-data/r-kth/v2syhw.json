I signed up for SSSB and for KTH's housing service, but I am not guaranteed to get a room through either as far as I know. Do you have any other recommendations to get a room, or is there a way to swap rooms with someone coming to my university from KTH?",

Join some of the FB groups for students here, particularly Lappis and Pax and Strix (unsure which others). People quite often advertise rents there. Otherwise, search Blocket for options.\n\nNEVER send money to someone here before meeting them and seeing the place. There are quite a few scammers out there. Good luck!",

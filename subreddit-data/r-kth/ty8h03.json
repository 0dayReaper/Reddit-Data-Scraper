I got admitted to my dream program, Distributed Systems (yay!), so I will likely be attending KTH (Kista) in August.  \nPM me if you want to get in touch before August, especially if you will be in the same program :)",

Underneath your waitlist number it would say how many folks in your group have been offered a place though, and I've seen that change.\n\nI believe they take in more people than the number of places available. So even those of us with a low waitlist number can't really be sure to get in. \n\nI'm on waitlist for Interactive Media Technology. Good luck!",

The \"no. of ppl in this selection group\" can go down for the same reason. Lets say if a person with a rank 40 does not want to be in the waitlist.

    "postText": "I am applying to KTH and Chalmers this semester. However, the admission process is extremely confusing to me. I am aware that I can apply to both these universities via the universityadmissions portal. I want to know if both these universities use the same set of documents as there's only one place where I can really upload them. For example, my letter of motivation should be tailored to each of these universities, but I'm not sure how to upload them in the portal separately.\n\nI would really appreciate it if someone could help me out! Additionally, please let me know if there's another forum I should be posting this question on.",

I remember reading somewhere on the university admissions website that universities will only read documents that they require and nothing else, so I think if you do it that way it will make it clear which university each letter belongs to.",

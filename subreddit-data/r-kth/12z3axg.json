    "postText": "Hi r/kth!  \n\n\nI'm a master's student from Brazil, looking for European universities to apply for a Ph.D. My research is focused on power electronics analysis, modeling, and control. Although I haven't published any journal articles, I will soon hit that mark.  \n\n\nHow hard is it to get accepted? One of the things that troubles me is my bachelor's grades. They weren't very good.... but my master's grades are fine. What's the selection like? What are the main criteria?  \n\n\nThanks for reading!",

Also I would think that if you have some relevant work experience in the field you're interested in, that could probably also help. You could also ask if there's an opportunity to do some work for the department as a research engineer, but I suppose that's difficult without a work permit.",

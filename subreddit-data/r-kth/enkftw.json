            "comment": "It's exam week now so, not so exciting.\nIt depends on your department and the subject. Like my department is production engineering and management, most of the subject there are kinda easy even though I didn't do production engineering in my bachelor's. Most ppl are in-doors cause it's winter and dark right now. No classes, so you're either studying or really bored. I try to connect with my old friends on video chat or play games on PC or watch some TV shows. Sleep becomes a huge issue, many ppl have a problem with the sleep cycle. It's usually because we don't have to wake up for classes so we are up all night almost till 3-5 am.",

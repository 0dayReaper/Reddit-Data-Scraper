    "postText": "Greetings! I am an incoming exchange student who was offered a Single Studio Apartment at Malvinas v\u00e4g 14. I\u2019m very happy with the offer and wish to find out more about staying in this accom! I\u2019m just wondering how the student life is like for those who stay in this accom. Is there any events going on in Malvinas v\u00e4g? Are people there close to each other?\n\nSince I am an exchange student so I am more interested in the fun things that are happening around :P\n\nReally appreciate any comment \ud83d\ude4c",

            "comment": "Hej! Malvinas is actually one of the best accommodations to be if you re interested in activities and having fun.\nThat is because is right on campus and is mainly used to accommodate the exchange students that arrive every semester, therefore 80%of the people there will be in your situation, which makes it great to meet people and find friends (I for example met my whole friends there during one of the first parties when I arrived)\nThere is quite some stuff going on, especially during the weekend as there is always parties either in the rooms or in the bike rooms.But as I said is also on campus and pretty central in the city so it s also super easy to get around and find your own fun and new activities. \nEnjoy!",

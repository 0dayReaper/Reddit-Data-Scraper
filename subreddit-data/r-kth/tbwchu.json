    "postText": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI applied for the KTH master's program in Sustainable Energy Engineering, but I am now realizing I would rather pursue the program in Chemical Engineering for Energy and Environment. I was wondering if I'd be able to switch programs were I accepted in April. I was recently awarded the KTH Scholarship if that makes any difference. Thanks for your help!",

From whom did you get the mail? I'm not able to find anything in my inbox, spam or trash folders, that's why am asking.  Let me know, thanks!",

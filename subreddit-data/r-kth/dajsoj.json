    "postText": "Hi everybody,\n\nI'm currently in my final year in a Hungarian secondary school and thinking about applying to ITC (English).  \nI did some research and found this piece of information:  \n\" It is possible that you could be offered a place later in the admissions process, if places are still available and you meet the eligibility criteria. You can also apply for courses and programmes taught in English that are offered in the second round. Please be aware that the chances of being offered a place are minimal.\" - ([https://www.universityadmissions.se/en/All-you-need-to-know1/Applying-for-studies/Documenting-your-eligibility-for-studies/Instructions-for-Bachelors-applicants/Students-in-their-last-year-of-upper-secondary-school/](https://www.universityadmissions.se/en/All-you-need-to-know1/Applying-for-studies/Documenting-your-eligibility-for-studies/Instructions-for-Bachelors-applicants/Students-in-their-last-year-of-upper-secondary-school/) )  \nDoes this mean that I would need to skip a year in order to apply in the first round because I would have less chance of being accepted in the second, with the same secondary education scores? It seems a little odd to me that they give away most of the places for students who aren't finishing their studies the year before.  \nIf anyone knows more about this, I would really appreciate if they could help me.\n\nThank you and have a nice day!",

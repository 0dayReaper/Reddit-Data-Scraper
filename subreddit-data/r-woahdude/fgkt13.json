The scrim is highly reflective and almost invisible in dark settings but the projector placement is essential to ensure there are no double images on the floors or ceilings. \n\nThe real art is in the content and adapting/utilizing it for specific spaces and applications.",

So it stops being circus and is just an art display.  \n\nWhich is fine, if you want an art display. But having a fake elephant perform fake tricks is fairly redundant.",

I am watching their shows since I was a little child and they never failed to amaze me.\n\n\nBut I am looking forward to a more realistic hologram show in the future, even if this circus will probably not be the pioneer in this form of art.

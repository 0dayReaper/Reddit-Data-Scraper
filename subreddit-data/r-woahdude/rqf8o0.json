Advertising worked for sure, but it\u2019s like how cats want to play in the box and not the object it came on. Simple is better sometimes.",

That creates a waterproof, hardened exterior. Certainly cracks in fiberglass would lead to issues when salt water get in, but those are repairable with yet more fiberglass and resin applied over the damage. \n\nBuilt well and maintained, a surfboard will last many years.",

I remember the shootouts and they had some kind of \u201cmystery house\u201d with wacky uneven floors and mirrors.",

There was a collection of cabins we'd always rent a week at, and if we were lucky, we got to see snow (Floridian).\n\nI was too young at the time to do the rollercoaster, if it even was a thing at the time, but I remember the tilted house, the sledding track, and the cowboy shootout on the promenade.  At least, I think all those things were there.",

The redneck working the ride jumped into the last car on the trains way out of the station and continued to ride the fucking thing standing up on the seats and using the lap bar as reigns to hold on to while the thing did the loop de loop. That place was special. And also a death trap.",

That is to say you can't view a rainbow top down only seeing the red arc, or bottom up only seeing the blue arc. It will always look like this \ud83c\udf08 no matter what angle you view it from.",

The first and strongest angle that light reflects back at is about 42 degrees. Rainbows occur directly opposite wherever the sun is from you. You cant see the full circle from the ground because in order for the top half to be high, the bottom half would be underground, essentially. When you're in a plane the sun can be behind you and the water droplets be in such a way that you can see the full circular/conic reflection",

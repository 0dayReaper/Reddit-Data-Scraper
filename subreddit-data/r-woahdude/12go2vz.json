Instead of curling the pages and flipping to get the animation, the disc spins in a circle. The speed that the disc is spinning is synced with the camera's frame rate/shutter speed, so each time the camera opens up its shutter, a new silhouette is in the frame. The speed is fast enough to trick your brain into perceiving the motion of a single subject, rather than a series of sequential photos. \n\nThis happens around 14-16 frames per second, but this video is at least 24fps, or probably 30fps. Hope that helps!",

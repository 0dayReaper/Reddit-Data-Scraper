            "comment": "Even The_Donald realizes this is a problem. Here's a comment from one of their users:\n\n----\n\n**Without Net Neutrality**, monopolies like Comcast and AT&amp;T will have more ability to **reduce competition and user choice** in their media. That also means companies they own, like Time Warner's **CNN will gain advantage**. Want to stop CNN? Want to keep your cord cutting services without paying ridiculous bandwidth cap fees? Conservatives NEED Net Neutrality.\n\nAT&amp;T is already pulling bullshit. Want unlimited data? You HAVE to buy their TV service too. You think it will get BETTER without Net Neutrality?\n\nComcast has forced data caps with a $50 fucking dollar fee for unlimited data. Net neutrality being enforced will enable lawsuits to stop these practices. Removing net neutrality will send the completely wrong message.\n\nThink you're safe here on T_D? They will slow all Conservative media bandwidth until it is practically unusable. If you push against Net Neutrality you are pushing against your own movement.\n\nThey can slow VPN traffic too. Pretty fucking horrifying what will happen if Net Neutrality is gone.\n\n- 2005 Madison River communications blocked VOIP services. [The FCC put a stop to that.](https://www.cnet.com/news/telco-agrees-to-stop-blocking-voip-calls/)\n\n- 2005 Comcast [denied access to p2p services](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/10/eff-tests-agree-ap-comcast-forging-packets-to-interfere) without notifying customers.\n\n- 2007 AT&amp;T [blocked Skype and other VOIP's](http://fortune.com/2009/04/03/group-asks-fcc-to-probe-iphone-skype-restrictions/) because they didn't like the competition for their cellphone services.\n\n- 2011 MetroPCS tried to block [all streaming except YouTube](https://www.wired.com/2011/01/metropcs-net-neutrality-challenge/). They actually sued the FCC over this.\n\n- 2011 AT&amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon blocked access to tethering apps on the android marketplace, with Google's help.\n\n- 2011 AT&amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon [blocked access to Google Wallet](http://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-blocking-google-wallet-2011-12) because it competed with their [own shitty payment apps](https://searchengineland.com/verizon-blocks-google-wallet-att-likely-to-do-the-same-103759).\n\n- 2012 Verizon [demanded google to block tethering apps](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/fcc-fines-verizon-125m-for-blocking-tethering-apps/2012/07/31/gJQAXjRLNX_blog.html?utm_term=.ca1cbb993dad) on android because it let owners avoid the $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do it as part of a winning bid on a airwaves auction. They were fines 1.25 million over this.\n\n- 2012 AT&amp;T tried to [block access to FaceTime](https://www.freepress.net/press-release/99480/att-blocking-iphones-facetime-app-would-harm-consumers-and-break-net-neutrality) unless customers paid more money.\n\n- 2013 Verizon stated that [the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the Net Neutrality rules in place.](https://www.savetheinternet.com/blog/2013/09/18/verizons-plan-break-internet)\n\n\n- 2016 Comcast instituted a mandatory data cap on all services with a $50 fee to get unlimited data. This allowed them to slow the bleeding of cord cutters, trapping them with fees from trying services like Sling or DirecTV Now. \n\n- 2017 [Time Warner Cable refused to upgrade their lines](https://www.polygon.com/2017/2/9/14548880/time-warner-lawsuit-new-york-league-of-legends-netflix) in order to get more money out of Riot Games (creators of League of Legends) and Netflix.\n\n\n\n#ISP's already have proven that without rules in place, they will behave in a way that can dictate how you use your internet connection.\n\n[Here's a couple more if you're curious](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/timothy-karr/net-blocking-a-problem-in_b_5695997.html)",

(Current as of February, 2017.)\n\nFaxZero has a system set up allowing you to fax your Representatives and Senators for free! (Faxes are \ngood if you can't get through on the phone lines, or just if you want congressional staffers to listen to fax machine noises until Net Neutrality is safe.) \n\nFax Congress\n\nFax Senators\n\nStep 3: Call, write, or fax to express your feelings on this. \n\nA lot of people are nervous about calling their elected officials for the first time, maybe you don't know what to say, or how to say it, or even who you'll be talking to, so here's what you'll need to know. \n\nThere's a 75% chance your call will be answered by a Secretary who is specifically there to listen to your concerns, there's a 25% chance your call will be bumped into a voicemail box which is specifically there to listen to your concerns, there is a ~0% chance you'll find yourself on the phone with your Senator or Representative. \n\nYou may be asked for your name and address or zip code, it's okay not to tell them if you don't want to, but the information is useful for your elected officials. I usually just give my first name, zip code, and the name of my town. \n\nDon't worry about a script, don't worry about being eloquent, you're not writing Shakespeare here, you're a concerned citizen voicing their frustrations, fears, and hopes. \"I'm really scared of Ajit Pai's plans to roll back net neutrality, a free and open internet is important to me because [Your reason here. Some suggestions: An open internet is important to democracy/I worry what Donald Trump might do with more power/Cable bills are already too high/etc.]. Please tell [Senator or Representative] that I support a free and open internet, I support Net Neutrality, and I vote.\" The only hard and fast rule is that you need to be polite; these folks are getting dozens, if not hundreds of calls a day, they don't need you bitching and swearing at them for something they have no control over. Be passionate, but be polite. \n\nReminder: Only call YOUR OWN elected officials! Calling Mitch McConnell from sunny Florida won't do anyone any good, and might actually harm the cause. Only call your own elected officials, period. \n\nSpread this information around, you can click \"source\" at the bottom of the comment to see an unformatted copy of this post that you can copy and paste.

Additionally, it looks like people are starting to organize protests!  I have included link to the Verizon protests below as well.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe know the fight for Net Neutrality is getting real, and the next few weeks are going to be tough. People have been making post after post, raising awareness, and encouraging people to write or call their congressman, support this or that movement, tweet... It's always about the written and verbal effort, but no real information about how we can physical organize to make a stand.\n\n**~~So my question is this, are there any real, major planned protests to fight for Net Neutrality?~~ We are finally starting to organize!**  I'm not talking about a hundred people here, or a thousand angry people there, but tens to hundreds of thousands of people across the country, willing to get out and take a legitimate stand for one of our actual freedoms. *If we lose this fight, we'll also lose those written and verbal outlets to take a stand and defend our other freedoms. If one falls, they all fall.*\n\nA large scale, country-wide, physical protest is one of our greatest weapons against those people who can turn a blind eye or just straight up ignore our written and verbal pleas.\n\nPlease, we need to organize something before it's too late. We need someone, or groups of people who are willing to put something together in their local areas. We need people who are willing to organize and march on DC.\n\nThere's a reason why the FCC and Congress waited for this week to make their announcements about their schedule and plans to kill Net Neutrality. They're scared. They want to make it inconvenient for us to stay informed and act. They want us to be traveling, focused on the holidays, black Friday, online shopping deals... They want to use the colder weather against us. They know people are taking vacation days for Thanksgiving and will likely be limited in taking time off after Thanksgiving as they save money and prepare for Christmas. The writing is on the wall. They're doing everything they can to limit us to just the written and verbal efforts, because once they win, they can crush those efforts as well.\n\nThe greatest way for our fight to gain momentum is to create and maintain a physical presence. We need to get organized, it needs to be big, and if need to be loud.\n\nPlease, if you know of any planned protests, share that information below. If you want to become an organizer, share that as well. Create Facebook groups and invite everyone, make posts about it in the various subreddits you're a part of to get more people active.  Check to see if your town/city has it's own Subreddit, or maybe even a Discord, and start communicating and coordinating with others on there.  Everyone can pitch in and make a difference here, and we're going to need all the support we can get.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**I'll go back and edit all of my posts and comments to add all of the information I receive to help increase its visibility. We need to act, and we need to act fast.**\n\nEdit:  Here's a subreddit to start organizing - https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_FCC_Protest/\n\nAlso, [here's the link to video about Net Neutrality that hit the top of r/all before being removed by the mods of r/videos only to be replaced by a Megathread.  Please consider adding this video to your comments to help keep it circulating!](https://youtu.be/UsyzP5hejxI)\n\n[Here's the link to the Verizon protests.](http://www.verizonprotests.com/)",

This sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nOne easy way to help us out is just simply sharing this all around. Make everyone informed. If the entire *WORLD* hates this, it will be an even stronger case. This also helps keep other counties from falling victim to the same issues.\n\nAmericans aren\u2019t informed enough to prevent it easily here, however, people around the world can attempt to educate others on the situation. The more that know, the better.\n\nAwareness protects other counties and gives the US chance. Donations give the US even more of a chance and spread even more awareness.\n\nI encourage anyone to just mention this, to atleast a few who don\u2019t know about it. It might just be the change we globally need to prevent it from happening anywhere else.",

I asked my bud for a sip of water and it does nothing. \"Maybe it'll go away after I eat.\", I say to myself.\n\nA few minutes later I got home, pulled out a half eaten burger from the fridge and wolfed it down with no nuking. And then went ahead to take a cold shower. \n\nI kinda felt better after that. I was worried for nothing. I was planning to brush my teeth and go to bed but something caught my eye. I think I'm getting dizzy again.\n\nDoes your reflection look like you see double as well?",

Because this thing only work if you write the exact same note of text as he did... the \"song\" algorithm cannot \"read\" words, it will just sound them out and this leads to really weird structure in the song.  \nI.e. if you want it to sing;  \nI like big butts and I cannot lie,  \nYou other brothers can't deny,\n\nIt will sound it out like;  \nI like big!   \nButts and I cannot,   \nLieeeeeeee  \nYou other!  \nBro - thers!

I've used this program, I've even used the code this program was based on.... It's basically a glorified autotune that also changes rhythm and drags out words. It will always, and I mean always, pick this exact tune, rhythm and way of \"making the song\"  it cannot do anything else....  \nIn all honesty? They have way better versions of this already out there, heck even things that were made in the early 2010's that are better than this.",

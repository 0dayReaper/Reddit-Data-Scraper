I haven't seen them IRL in about 40 years\u2014I'm gratified to see the tide pools are thriving.  \nI used to go to summer camp down on the Oregon Coast near Newport. Every year the camp counselor who was (in his day job) also a fish &amp; game biologist would schedule very early morning tide pool field trips. Even growing up in the woods of Southwest Washington I'd never seen so much life packed into one place\u2014not by nature, anyway\u2014and wanted to just stay there all day.\n\nTurns out they call them \"tide\" pools for a reason, and with Oregon's infamous coastal undertow (at least around there), there wasn't a chance of that happening. But I did get down there every chance I got.",

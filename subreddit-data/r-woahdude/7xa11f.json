In my opinion the styles are inspired by the following:\n\n1) regular video\n\n2) seems like impressionist style based on the colors\n\n3) digital art\n\n4) clay\n\n5) reminds me of cartoon expressionism\n\n6) the mix of painting and real photos is a reference to postmodern art imo\n\n7) geometric shapes, so maybe cubism\n\n8) basically realism\n\n9) gothic maybe? just based on the colors, not sure about this one\n\n10) seems like surrealism\n\nThe lines between different art styles are pretty loose so take this with a grain of salt.",

Thinner barrels most often will suffer point of impact shifts and groups opening up due to the heating of the barrel. Bull barrels help mitigate this with additional material that requires more heat transferred to the barrel to elevate the temperature of the barrel as a whole.\n\nThe key to mechanical precision in rifles is to minimize the variability in the system. Barrel whip is fine so long as it is the same wave pattern and timing shot after shot. Many rimfire barrel tuners operate on the idea that you can alter the timing of the barrel vibrations so that the bullet exits the muzzle at a good point in the wave. \n\nSo long as the movement happens in the same way every time, it is still repeatable and thus precise down range. \n\n",

Do your research, spend the money, a good 1911 is the pinnacle of \u201cthis small thing puts really big holes in stuff.\u201d Admittedly I owned a Taurus 1911 .45 auto, which is on the lower scale, but worked great for the 1,000 rounds I put through it.

And you would probably be just fine with a 14 inch barrel even in rural combat areas.\n\nThere is a reason most squads only have one long gun. They are nice to have but most of the time ya don't need em.\n\nAnd if ya got that M14 with that 22inch monster on it. I hope you've got some training in windage, shooting with elevation differences, and range finding.",

Neglecting energy transfer into the cutting object, the kinetic energy of the bullet would all end up in the resulting bullet fragments, in proportion to their masses. Any number of bullet fragments would carry the same amount of kinetic energy as the originating single bullet. The effect on a target would be very different (due to spreading energy and momentum across a larger number of smaller particles), but the total kinetic energy of the impactors would not be diminished.",

Maybe it's Maybelline. \n\nThe far more likely answer, though, is that the \"samurai guy\" actually can't cut bullets, and the whole thing is a trick. The weapon is stabilized and repeatedly fired (not hand held as shown before the cut) so that the flight path is predictable. Then it's just a matter of swinging the sword through the flight path with the correct timing until you get a lucky hit.\n\nIt is well known that reality tv is a lie. I think the odds of the crappy little tv show being deceptive are high, and the odds of a japanese guy being able to reliably detect and intercept a bullet or pellet are near-zero.",

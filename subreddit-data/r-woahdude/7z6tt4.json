The wave function isn't a tangible thing. You use the wave function to figure things out about a quantum system, such as its probability distribution of certain quantities related to the system.\n\nIsn't Gizmodo the same site that wrote that inflammatory article about Ken Bone?

According to Born's rule the probability density is simply the complex amplitude of the wave function squared. And the wave function in the Schrodinger equation simply represents position and momentum, since spin wasn't discovered at that time. Getting into particular formulations is beyond what the average reader would be expected to know.\n\nAs for whether the wave function is a tangible thing, since it represents the probability distribution of a specific quantum state if you can recreate the system you're trying to measure again and again then you can capture the average values of the wave function at particular points in space. Of course, it's impossible to clone actual quantum states, but if you're just interested in the hydrogen atom's ground state then cloning isn't necessary anyway.",

The imaging technique used in the image is Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, which is the highest resolution imaging technique available to our species at present. This microscope moves a needle across a surface and essentially (very simplified picture) squirts electrons either at the sample or sucks one from the sample. Depending on the amount of electrons it gets from that spot, it can determine the distance away from the sample, creating a topological map. Considering the very low energy levels required for this technique to work, it can not probe into the nucleus.",

They are produced when particles have to change direction suddenly, mass is reduced in some particle decay/annihilation, when a particle's energy is reduced to a less energetic state, etc.\n\nIn large materials, these things randomly happen all the time - especially if they are hot - hence why everything emits some light.\n\nA hydrogen particle is different. Something about its state would have to change (ie: its subatomic particles would have to do something interesting) then a photon will be released with the energy that was lost in that event. That energy will determine the photon's color.\n\nIt's like a flat pond. You have to drop a stone in to make a ripple.\n\nWhat you're seeing in the image is the field around the atom, rendered in color. It's essentially just a graph but that's really no different from taking a photo.",

Carbon atoms (to pick a common one) are 1.7 angstr\u00f6m (0.17nm) wide, so you'd a surface of 2236x2236 atoms (380/0.17), so the end result would be a square, mono-atomic layer of 4999696 atoms.  If you make that a cube instead of a square, that's 11179320256 atoms. \n\nThat said, you'd probably need something a bit bigger than this though, since light is diffracted by smaller objects/slits, which'd distort what you see, so by my calculations, \"a fuckton\" would be a more accurate answer.\n\nEdit : apparently, colour doesn't work like this, and you can have much smaller objects that still display a colour.

The essentially spherical shape would be a result of a hydrogen atom having just one electron and therefor only (half) filling the 1s shell. Not sure why there is more structure to the image, anything you use to measure at that scale will disturb what you are trying to measure though so perhaps it's an artefact of that promoting the electron to higher orbitals.",

This shit is getting super dangerous. Eventually we're gonna have an incident where somebody creates fake evidence of a crime that a prominent person \"committed\", i.e. Joe Biden partying on Epstein island for example, and from that point on we will never be able to trust video or audio recordings as evidence. It's a blank check to both persecute the innocent and exonerate the guilty. We need laws on this shit ASAP",

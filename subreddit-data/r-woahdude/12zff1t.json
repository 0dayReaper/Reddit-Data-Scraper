One thing to keep in mind is the cartridges are only rated for about 80 hours of exposure or 40-60 hours of continuous use, so when you're done with them put them in a sealed baggie to help them last longer. Won't necessarily be OSHA compliant, but as long as you still replace them after about 40 hours of use you should be fine. The P100 part has a much longer useable life based only on usage and not really on exposure, but the OV part will only last about a week of full time usage",

Silver is not a gas. Even when you create silver \"vapors\", you're creating a fine mist of silver dust. Yes, it is briefly molten but it will solidify long before it reaches your mask. (It's not a red hot mist, right?)\n\nIf you want to go the extra mile, get a proper fit testing. Sealing any leaks around the edges will make a bigger difference than anything else. \n\nEye protection is a given.\n\nIronically, silver nanoparticles are fairly healthy, they're used in medicine. Not in the same way of course. But you don't need to panic if you get it on your skin once by accident.",

I have spent a good amount of my working life wearing masks and respirators. \n\nPaper masks simply don't fit as well as a respirator. The shitty elastic/rubber straps on them don't push the mask against your face hard enough for it to provide a good seal. If you're in a cloud of concrete dust for a decent amount of time with a paper mask on, eventually you will get a build up of concrete dust on your skin around your nose. It will stop a good amount of it, as in you won't get crunchy shit between your teeth like you would no mask, but you can also smell the dust which means you are breathing cilica.\n\nA good respirator is also just shaped to fit on your face better than the paper ones. The paper masks are shaped better than they used to be, but still a far way off a silicone respirator.",

If you get ones that are shaped right, they do make a pretty effective seal with your face. I've dealt with zinc fumes when welding galvanized steel, and while the cloud of fumes wasn't nearly as dense as a cloud of concrete dust, a well fitting paper mask can still protect you very well. The respirator is always the better option, but if you aren't doing something regularly that requires that level of filtering, then it's not always feasible to spend money on an expensive and well fitting respirator, in which case the paper ones are your best option.\n\nIf you have the money, or if you work in an environment with a lot of dust, by all means, get a respirator, they are definitely more comfortable. But they also aren't for everyone just because of their sheer cost.\n\nI have a PAPR system for my job now, and if you have the money, a PAPR is the most comfortable and most effective thing you could get, but not everyone can reasonably afford to spend $1000+ on a quality PAPR, just like how not everyone can afford to spend $100+ for a day of DIY work",

The white ones you're referring to catch a LOT, and assuming the filter type is the same they will catch the majority of what the respirator will catch. \n\nThat said, the respirators *do* seal better than the white ones. It's not a massive difference. Maybe 5-10%? But they definitely provide a more consistent seal around the cheeks and jawline than the paper ones.",

When you expose a human to that kind of force, they tend to get turned into red mist. I know this because one of the lathe accident videos on liveleak back in the day had such red mist, as it pulverized the dudes legs, the only part left dangling after his head and arms and torso all got wrapped around a piece of round bar stock. Dude literally got wrapped around it in the blink of an eye it was going so fast too, and he probably felt every bit of it. The kill part is true, and it happens in an instant, but the brain can keep going on after that for longer, so it isn't nearly as instant as one would like. Also not all lathe accidents are fatal, sometimes it just rips your limb from its socket instead",

You have a similar lack of activities but the culture is far different, and in my experience, hostile.\n\nMy rural area voted against a school board candidate for being transphobic (literally wanted to ban the \"transgender curriculum\"), we were essentially in near entire agreement \"let kids be kids, i don't fucking care how they dress or want to be talked to like\".\n\nSmall towns don't have the same attitude. Anything you do gets talked and talked until you die. At least in urban areas you can get lost in the crowd.",

The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard\u2019s blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.\n\n--The Adventure of the Copper Breeches, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle",

The sides of it were basically cratered and you had to drive in the middle to go over 20 mph. This led to regular head on collisions. Wrecks aside, that road would destroy your car. I spent about 2k in repairs over the year I had to travel it regularly. They finally fixed it a few years ago, but it was decades of trouble before they did.",

And I think this is an *excellent question.* Maybe the first, best question to ask.\n\n(Edit: the people downvoting you should maybe chill for a second. This art motivated you to ask a sincere question. What could possibly be wrong with that?)\n\nPersonally, I don't automatically go gaga over renderings that show consummate draftsmanship. Like hyper-real portraits. Especially those copied from photos. They show impressive skill but leave out my favorite thing about art, which is a glimpse at the eye, or the personality, of the artist.\n\nIn this case, though, I perceive a few things going on. These images do get at my feelings. I feel like you get a powerful emotional sense from the composition and colors of these images -- and the fact that they are painted invests them with weight and gravitas.\n\nLike, these are images of sad and nearly-abandoned places. A photo would be journalistic, it would be *documentation;* it could be moving and contemplative.\n\nBut the fact that these are painted implies a kind of obsessive, urgent attention. Almost a form of protest. You know those monks who burned themselves to protest the Vietnam war? This guy burned hours, days, weeks of his life looking at, thinking about,  the weirdly beautiful, melancholy, lonely parking lot of a little motel or cafe that almost no-one goes to. With the neon sign still declaring the original promise of the entrepreneur who built it up.\n\nIt's bittersweet and it's also *urgent.*\n\n*\"I invested days of my life looking at EVERY DETAIL of this town under a microscope, I put all of my talent into showing you what I saw, I want you to also look at it, no really LOOK AT IT AND SEE WHAT IT IS LIKE NOW.\"* \n\nThat is what I get from it.\n\n[Warning: if you hate art interpretation, stop reading now. I'm making a note here below for my own future reference. Thanks and good luck.\n\nBonus notes:\n\nIn the way they appeal to emotion, these somewhat remind me of the raw-emotional abstract paintings of Mark Rothko, which I can only ever see as foreground and background under a big sky. Even though the style is so different.\n\nMark Rothko meets Edward Hopper.\n\nAnd it's not for nothing that the asphalt parking lots are so aggressively foregrounded. It's right in your face, coming right at ya. The instant I saw that arrangement, I thought about what's under the tarmac. *They paved paradise and put in a parking lot* -- and for what? None of the subjects of these paintings have been around for more than 70 or 80 years, and they are fading fast.]",

Or whatever.\n\nIf you can plausibly contact Mr. Penner and obtain a statement that this is his technique, I will buy you a pizza. It will be a shitty pizza, as I am not a wealthy man, but it will be pizza.\n\nWhat he probably did is go to these towns, carefully choose sites that spoke to him,  obtain permission where appropriate, take *umpteen* photographs, then go back to his studio.\n\nNow I don't see perspective lines on the painting shown here \"under construction\" -- though of course he could have erased them -- and that suggests he did not draw the buildings *ex machina* but rather used photos as a guide. My quasi-educated guess would be that he used a projector to get the composition he wanted on the canvas, tracing a pencil outline, and then used several other reference photos for lighting, sky, whatever other details.\n\nThe point being that between the site visits, the photos he took, the collation of details, and every decision point along the way is where his personality and mood leak onto the canvas.\n\nI'm not sure whether I need more coffee or less.",

We naturally do this and take part in enjoying it just because it's part of our brains.\n\nLike, this guy really wanted to spend so much time making these paintings, and people really like them in part because they're impressed by the skill. It's entertaining and inspiring. There's artistic value in that by itself.\n\nThey also convey feeling. I'm sure these are 100% based off of photos, but imagine he just took these real places and made up the atmosphere, as in, the weather, lighting, etc. That would be his own imagination about these places that he puts down onto canvas.\n\nWhatever it is, yeah while just taking a photo is *logical* and I agree with your question, fact is that this guy did this, we like it, and for that it has value.",

Think about how immersive it is to deconstruct the perspective, the vanishing point(s), the major structures, the highlights shadows and midtones, mixing every color with painstaking scrutiny. This is an artist's experience recreating his view of a time and place for himself, you are only here to enjoy the outcome. -artist, painter myself",

While I appreciate the effort and skill, it falls flat for me when it doesn\u2019t take that same effort and skill and bend the result in some way (scale for example, a la Chuck Close). \nIn some sense all representational art is a party trick of sorts, but at least by not being photo realistic painters can pull and stretch the results into something more.",

He's a realist painter but he mostly does plein air watercolor/gouache and works with limited palettes and shorter time frames. He shows his process on YouTube. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/6_UmdDnddpg\n\nTo me this style has way more soul than the one in the OP, although impressive.",

You start with a projected image, which he does. Then you use tiny brushes and spend the time with color matched piles of paint. You can use photoshop to compare each tiny area. It might take a few weeks, but it's less about \"artistic\" skill than patience. Thus you may hear these artists boasting about how the painting took X amount of time to complete.",

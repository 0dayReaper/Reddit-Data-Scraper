You would end up in a very slightly different orbit, but would not fall back down to Earth.\n\n**Eventually** due to the fact that you're in LEO, you'd (or rather your lifeless corpse due to lack of food, water, oxygen) deorbit after being hit by enough random particles of atmosphere. Although the atmosphere is *incredibly* thin at the height of the ISS, it is not like geostationary orbit and things *will* deorbit after several months if not continuously boosted with fuel/engines. The ISS periodically does boosting burns for this precise reason. The ISS also does several maintenance tasks such as \"feathering\" the solar panels into the prograde direction at \"night\" time so to lower air resistance even more, as the solar panels make up a large percentage of the profile of the ISS.",

That's gonna just immediately turn off most any flat earther\n\nNow not in defense of that point anymore, Watching the live stream right now they are no longer looking straight down, but looking more straight on at the actual horizon.\n\nIn this angle, the curve is completely apparent, and completely unrelated to any fish-eyeing of the camera. If you don't already know why then it could take me forever to explain, I hope you'll just suffice me to say that fish-eyed lenses do not work that way. They don't just magically turn everything into a sphere no matter how you look at them.\n\nAlso, ain't it interesting how every picture of the earth ever taken from orbit or altitude or whatever has been taken from a position completely dead center on the \"circle\" of the earth, every single time?\n\nYou would think, if the earth were flat, that you could get more or less close to any one of the edges but, oddly enough that seems to *never* happen. Everybody looking down just so happens to be perfectly in the middle of the circle every single time with absolutely no exceptions.....\n\n...or, you know, it's a sphere; And that is exactly how that is supposed to look.",

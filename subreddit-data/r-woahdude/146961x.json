Can't even remember what movie that was now.",

If you're on the cusp of needing glasses to see, your eyes can essentially muscle themselves into line to keep things in focus. You won't realise you're doing it but it's like if you'd been concentrating on one of those magic-eye 3D pictures all day. If you spend 10 hours doing that or are just tired or in general, you'll end up too fatigued to keep it up.\n\nHaving glasses will let your eyes relax and you'll have a way easier time keeping things in focus. I find that if I wear mine while I'm working, I'm fine without them in the evenings which used to be the other way around. A weird side effect though is that with the glasses your eyes get used to relaxing and you'll get worse without having them on. You might need a new set of glasses in your first year or two of having them before your vision settles.\n\nDisappointing fact: this is the underlying cause for a lot of inattentive kids in schools. Spending a full day concentrating on their schoolwork is near impossible for them because they're exhausted just by trying to _read_ their schoolwork. Because they can manage the reading part at all, nobody ever suspects their vision is the issue and so they never get tested. Instead you have a child who can't focus, inevitably becomes bored, inevitably starts acting out, and gets dismissed as a bad student. Eye care isn't cheap but $200 of glasses can make for a vastly different schooling experience.",

The example on wikipedia is incomplete, though. In my case, my whole perspective leaves an imprint any time my eyes move, with the brightest objects producing the darkest \"negatives\".\n\nI have the illusory kind, but if the hallucinogenic form of palinopsia is similar, that's a fucked thing to develop for doing something so minor.",

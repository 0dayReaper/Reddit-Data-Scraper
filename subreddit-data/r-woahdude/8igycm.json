It looks better and you can get better looking graphics on your 1080 monitor without needing to buy a higher resolution one. Once you turn the option on, the higher resolutions will appear in game and you can set the game to it even though it's still being displayed at your native resolution. Works great for older games to improve the graphics a bit but will obviously cost a decent hunk of performance. If you don't have a higher resolution monitor and are thinking about getting one, this is a perfect way to find out how your favorite games will do in 1440 or 4k",

Anyways, i remember sitting on the patio smoking a cigarette with my friend. We were in a great conversation about nonsense im sure, and i looked down at my cigarette and saw the embers devouring the paper and the tobacco. Take a drag, watch the embers brighten with excitement then just eradicate the paper. It was one of the most beautiful things i have ever seen. I will never forget it. I only got that visual when i did shrooms, i didnt have the capability of focussing in that great of detail sober. It was a massive disappointment. \n\nNow i saw this... this may give me the ability to relive that glorious memory. I would love to see the camera record a cigarette burning. \n\nI also quit smoking a while back, so if someone else could do it that would be rad. ",

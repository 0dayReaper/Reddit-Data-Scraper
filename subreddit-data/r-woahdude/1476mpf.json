You use prompts to create what you are looking for. I've seen other options than my videos where people are using Stable Diffusion and Deformun. That's my next goal in figuring out. \n\nI'm more familiar with Midjourney since I have that though. To get Midjourney, you need discord so if you don't have that, create an account and download the app.  Then find Midjourneys website and down at the bottom of the page, I think on the left side, it should say beta. Click that and follow the steps on adding it to your discord. I actually have Midjourney privately beyond favorites saved, within my own discord page so you can find tutorials online on how to add that to your own discord page if you'd like. \n\nFor Kaiber AI, just find their website and create an account. There is actually a 7 day free trial but it's more like one or two really really short videos but it will give you an idea if you like it or not. Just make sure you come back and cancel it if you don't like it or it will charge you after the first week. I ended up paying for it but I do wish that I found Deformun before paying for it based on some of the awesome videos I have seen. Next pay check I suppose! Lol",

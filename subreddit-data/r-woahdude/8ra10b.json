These trails were well known for becoming extremely wet and flooded after a solid day's rain. It was night time and we had all just smoked a little pot, something my friends did often but I wasn't quite used to at this point. I was driving and came up to a large puddle very similar to this one and slammed on my brakes. I had been out in these trails thousands of times but not once did I remember there being caves and taverns leading underground. It seriously blew my mind, even after discovering they were just reflections I couldn't unsee these deep caves. Someone else had to get out and drive or I was going to shit myself. Yet somehow, my friends were able to see just the puddles, and were keeled over laughing at me and how \"stoned I was\" and how I couldn't handle a little bud.     \n\nI've thought about this since that day more than 10 years ago, and everyone I've tried to explain it to looks at me like I have three heads. This is the first time I've ever seen this recreated in a picture and I can finally say I know I'm not crazy. ",

I didn't know the guy.\n\nSo friend tells me how to get to his \"apartment.\"  Turns out it was this strange, ~8 story concrete building in a pretty bad part of town, but it's like 2 PM so NBD.\n\nSo I park and we go in.  The whole building is concrete, all the doors are metal, and the walls are all painted blue.  As we're going up the stairwell you can hear people playing music coming out of the apartments.  Guy invites us in, and his place is a big concrete room.  No kitchen, no bathroom, just a room with a drum set in the corner and some cushions on the ground.  I'm pretty sketched out at this point.  Place was like nothing my middle class suburban ass had never seen.\n\nSo friend gets his money and we leave.  When we get back down to ground level, the stairwell keeps going underground.  Curious, we go down a couple floors.  It gets pretty dark (and smells pretty bad), but we can see okay when the stairwell just ends into the floor.  I'm like, \"Well that's strange, lets go.\"  Friend is like, \"WEEEEE\" and hops down the last few steps on the floor.\n\nExcept it wasn't the floor.  It was water that had been there so long it was black.  SPLOOOSH (and not the good sploosh).\n\nLuckily I had towls in my car, but it still took a while for the stank to get out from him having to sit there in nasty ass wet clothes until we get back to his place.",

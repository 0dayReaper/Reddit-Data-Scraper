Funny enough it is an old town with more than two thousand years where Tujia Minority people live together. It is one of the best attractions to seek peace and visit classicism and it is also the portal of Mengdong River scenic. Furong Town not only has the beautiful natural landscape and rich Tujia ethnic folk customs, but also is a perfect place to explore a lot of protected cultural relics and records of Tujia political and military history. More than three hundred relics collected in Tujia Diaojiaolou buildings (vernacular pillar-supported dwellings) is the best presentation of Tujia culture. The town is surrounded by green mountains and rivers. You will see winding paths and Tujia Diaojiaolou buildings by the river after coming into the township. And there is a waterfall inside the town and it is a must see here. This waterfall is about 40 meter wide with a drop height of 60 meters, and looks spectacular in rainy season from June to August. Walking behind the hanging water screen of the waterfall is like placing oneself in a crystal palace. The Palace of Tusi (appointing hereditary headmen of national minority in the Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties in old China) is another highlight in the town. It is actually a Tujia Diaojiaolou building complex. It was built by a rich chieftain of the Tujia nationality for summer resort. In front of the palace is an ever-flowing stream and on the both sides are cliffs.Due to it remote geographical location, village size, inconvenient transport and lack of promotion, Furong Ancient Town is less popular than Fenghuang Ancient Town. But this is also its advantage, as it is more peaceful compared with Fenghuang being stuffed with tourists. So besides misleading most of the people on here from actually going to this gorgeous authentic site you also for some reason completely made up false information about it. How come you hate China so much man did you lose your manufacturing job in Columbus, New Mexico to those damn Chinese workers. I feel for you but going online and lying won't help you feel better. ",

Sure, it's got it's problems, but it will always hold a great place in my heart and I have a lot of optimism for its future.  I encourage anyone to go to China and enjoy all that it has to offer.  I have not written a single disparaging remark about China in this entire thread.  So whatever you're imagining you've read, you're wrong.  \n\nNow I'm sorry to break it to you, but this is indeed a place built around tourism.  There are many places like this in China.  That the place has a deep history and an ethnic Chinese population doesn't change that fact.  To be sure, they play up those aspects for the tourists.  I don't fault them for it, and I don't think it detracts from anything, but it is what it is.  ",

There's a lot of these places in China, which help the people hearken back to a sense of the old days they've given up.  Often the trinkets are pretty good though, as the local ethnic people will usually be selling their handicrafts and art, which ranges from pottery and wood carvings to jewelry and weavings, and of course tea and local food dishes.   \n\nDamn, now I find myself really missing a cool bottle of yak yogurt.

Every 10 feet is a beautiful opportunity for a nice 35mm Nikon shot.\n\nHopefully you don't think that shot is a representation of that city at all working hours of the day/night.... how about I show you how empty Washington D.C. looks like at 6am on a Monday during a Federal Holiday.",

The jelly-like creature sailed along in front of the Five Deeps team's deep-sea submarine, in perfect view of the camera, displaying a blue and white balloon-like floater. Jamieson describes it as a \"stalked Ascidean,\" a type of sea squirt, albeit one we have never laid eyes on before. \"It is not often we see something that is so extraordinary that it leaves us speechless,\" Jamieson said in a statement.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.cnet.com/science/scientists-discover-bizarre-new-sea-squirt-stalking-the-ocean-floor/\r  \n\r  \nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVa-aVIa-B4",

Ascidians are not yet vertebrates, but they are the closest group to them. Surprisingly they share many different traits with vertebrates, many of which disappear after the animal completes the development into an adult.\nOne interesting fact about them is that they produce a special mucus composed of a mixture of iodine and water (which are very common in the ocean), and that is used to trap the food while they filter water through the endostyle. The same endostyle evolved in vertebrates as thyroid, and that explains why we still need iodine to have a healthy thyroid gland, and also why thyroid deficiencies are more frequent in population living far from the sea.",

It means they have, at some point in their life cycle, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, a notochord, pharyngeal slits, and a muscular post-anal tail. \n\nAll vertebrates are chordates, but chordate is the broader grouping (Phylum), so not all chordates are vertebrates (a Class).

And even then, probably only if it's conclusively shown to be lifeless.\n\nA *huge* concern in these missions (and a big reason landings haven't been attempted yet) is contamination. If you accidentally brought any microbes from Earth, they might be able to survive there and start multiplying. This could ruin your search for life by giving you false positives, and *worse*, if there *is* life already there, the newly introduced life might be more advanced and out-compete it ... and you could end up wiping out the very life you came to study.\n\nIt's already extremely difficult to sanitize/sterilize a robotic probe sufficiently. (We're *still* not good enough at it to really be comfortable landing probes on potentially life-bearing worlds. 99.99999% isn't good enough. There has to be *zero* microbes on your probe. And that's nearly impossible to achieve. Any procedure violent enough to absolutely sterilize the probe would probably also damage the delicate instruments on the probe.) But it would be *absolutely* impossible to sanitize/sterilize a manned mission. A manned mission would be *guaranteed* to contaminate the environment with terrestrial microbes.\n\nThe only way manned missions could be condoned is if a very thorough investigation with robotic probes concluded that there was no native extraterrestrial life present whatsoever. Then there wouldn't be any risk of contamination ruining our efforts to study that life.",

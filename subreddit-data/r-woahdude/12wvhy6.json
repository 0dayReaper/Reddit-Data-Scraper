This may sound cliche, but when I take acid or shrooms it\u2019s almost like my brain processes information in a different way. I tend to feel more connected to the world around me, it makes simple things like petting my cat feel so much more rewarding and engaging for a multitude of reasons. The visuals just really help to remind me I\u2019m on a different plane of existence in that moment, even if it\u2019s just the drugs making me feel that way. Sometimes it can be overwhelming. I\u2019d recommend trying a low dose of psychedelics at least once as long as you don\u2019t have a history of psychosis.",

The visuals can get much more intense/intricate on higher doses and/or with your eyes closed. \n\nHowever, it is important to note, that visuals are only one component of a trip. They are partly due to different areas of your brain communicating that dont usually communicate, as well as loosening certain \"filters\" that allow the brain to produce useful everyday visual stimuli. Now this effect is happening all across the mind, imagine this sort of effect happening to the way you process all information.",

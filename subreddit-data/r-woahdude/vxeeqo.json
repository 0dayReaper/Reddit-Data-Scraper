We are confined to the limits of our own universe, by any rationality.\n\nHowever, if one believes as such, the proof would be inside our own elementary particles, as one would then expect it to work both ways.\n\nYou would expect that at some point as you go smaller and smaller inside of atoms, instead of discovering new subatomic particles or finding a class of particles even smaller than that, eventually you reach nothingness, but in that nothingness would be a universe that is essentially non-interactive with our own.\n\nIt's a fun theory. But it also seems a bit romantic to me. Seems more likely that there's just ever-larger structure as you expand and expand the scope of existence, and our universe is more likely to act more like a galaxy within our own universe; more or less independent but still one of a staggeringly large amount and a part of something larger which is part of something larger yet and so on.",

All we can see are distant galaxies that are already out of view, and we just see their lingering image in space.\n\nThis doesn't really preclude the possibility of a meta-physical answer to if we're connected to a larger system via conscious experience of the universe, but it's really, really hard to prove meta-physics. However discussing and imagining these ideas can lead to new perspectives and discoveries in our physical universe.\n\nedit: to everyone chiming in to say \"*but what about X, couldn't that be used to exchange information?*\" let me reiterate, ***meta-physics***. Meta-physics doesn't by default mean spirituality and chakras and elephants stacked on turtles and sitar music, it simply means something outside physics as we know it, we have no tools either physical or theoretical to describe and test for meta-physical phenomenon. Doesn't mean it doesn't exist, just that we have no way to confirm or disprove it does. You can have a *great* idea for how something may work conceptually, but without means to observe and test, it's indistinguishable from *bad* ideas for how something works.",

            "comment": "Astronomer here!  What a day.  Here are the new images/data, both what they are and what we can learn about them! (In order they're released)-\n\n- **SMACS 0723**- This is a galaxy cluster 4.5 billion light years away (white fuzzy blobs), which is acting as a gravitational lens for galaxies 13 *billion* light years away (red fuzzy blobs)!  It was released yesterday so if you want way more info, please check out my post from yesterday [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/vwvcnu/my_thoughts_on_the_first_jwst_image/) so I don't repeat myself, but the spectrum (elemental composition) shown today *is* new, and us astronomers are surprised we can see the spectra so well for the far-away galaxies!  Also note: the bright white points with rays radiating from them are not galaxies, but instead are stars within our own galaxy that happen to be in that direction!\n\n- **Exoplanet [WASP-96 b](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/5152/wasp-96-b/):** This is a gas giant planet about half the size of Jupiter, located 1,120 light years away from Earth, orbiting its parent star roughly every 3.5 days (yes, it's *really* close in!).  JWST cannot image this planet because it is too small and the parent star is too bright, but it *can* observe a transit as this planet passes in front of its parent star and measure the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere. (You then observe the star when the planet isn't transiting, and subtract the difference.) This planet was specifically chosen as it's thought to have fewer clouds that dominate the signal of these chemicals, so it's easier to get a strong signal- more detailed explanation [here](https://twitter.com/aussiastronomer/status/1546836340716621824).  This signal showed a lot of water vapor in the atmosphere (!!!)-  which, wow, really exciting start to future JWST observations if we can see water (and confirm the presence of some clouds)!  (It's worth noting the water is more like steam because this is a REALLY HOT exoplanet- don't think liquid water oceans or anything here.)\n\nAlso good news if you like exoplanets, we will be seeing the first science papers on other exoplanets by the end of the *month*!  I have it on good authority that there's a team standing by to get the first regular science program results analyzed and the journal is on stand-by to referee/ publish them. :)\n\n- **Southern Ring Nebula**, aka [NGC 3132](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_3132)- This is a [planetary nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula), which has nothing to do with planets and is instead the outer shell of a star like our sun that died and poufed out its outer layers. (which can then potentially help trigger new star formation).  JWST can tell us a lot about how this process happens and how the elements get distributed... and a gorgeous image along the way sure doesn't hurt! :) As for the image itself... wow.  This is gonna sound kinda dumb but I never thought I would see the layers of ejecta with this level of detail!!!  Embedded with little galaxies at much greater distances!  Incredible! \n\nEdit: There's some confusion about the central star, so I looked into this carefully.  There are actually two stars in the center of this nebula, one of which is the white dwarf that ejected the layers, and the other is still another star in its \"normal\" stage of life.  They are easier to tell apart in the [second image](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-captures-dying-star-s-final-performance-in-fine-detail).  Which OMG, I'm am SO EXCITED about this!  The reason is a lot of questions are out there about how planetary nebulae form, and one theory is you require a binary companion to get these detailed structures.  Seeing the second star like this enshrouded in dust is the first time we're seeing this pair, and wow I can't wait to see what JWST finds next!!!\n\n- **Stephen's Quintet**- When I saw this was on the first release list I was so excited because the Hubble image was already incredible and one of my favorites!  [Stephen's Quintet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephan%27s_Quintet) is a group of 5 galaxies of which four are physically together (and will probably merge someday).  As JWST is ultimately a telescope designed to look at galaxies, this is definitely a \"before and after\" type image to compare to Hubble... and wow did it do that!  What's amazing here is that we see the dust between the galaxies so well- remember, the majority of the normal stuff out there is dust, not stars, so it's super important to understand how this dust works.  To me though, it's not science what always steals the show are all those li'l background galaxies even *further* away, some of which are ALSO merging!!!  Galaxies everywhere!\n\n- **Carina Nebula**- This is a [nebula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula), ie dust cloud where stars are being born 8,500 light years from Earth, but wow it's amazing how much more detail there is than in the older Hubble image!  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_Nebula#/media/File:NGC_3372d.jpg) is the Hubble image with all the features labeled.  Mind, my astronomer friend who works in the theory behind star formation is *super* excited about this image- lots of questions abound on how exactly the gas and dust clumps to form stars, so pictures like this with better detail are *always* helpful!  There will definitely be many, many more of these from JWST btw, because infrared light (where it mainly observes) is *really* good at tracing dust in nebulae!\n\nFinally, if I may copy/paste a few common questions from yesterday's post, about JWST:\n\n**Pretty pictures aside, can I access the actual science data?**\n\nThe JWST archive will be launched with all the commissioning data for these images on **Wednesday, July 13 at 11am EDT**, with the first Early Release Science programs' data going up on **Thursday**.  Specifically for the latter, there are \"early release science\" programs which are going to be prioritized over the first three months (list [here](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-ers-programs)) where those data are going to be immediately available to the public, so everyone can get a jump start on some of the science. (Also, the next cycle of JWST proposals is in January, so this is going to be really crucial for people applying for that.) My understanding from my colleague is there are many people in the sub-field of early galaxies who literally have a paper draft ready to go and intend to get the preprints out ASAP (like, within hours), just because there will be so much low hanging fruit for that field in those very first images!  Like, I'll be shocked if they're not out by the end of the week, and the place to see those first science papers are on the [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/new) (updates at 0:00 UTC).\n\nYou can learn more about the JWST archive [here](https://www.stsci.edu/contents/news/jwst/2022/accessing-jwst-science-data-after-the-end-of-commissioning).\n\n**How did they decide what to observe anyway?**\n\nAs is the case for all NASA telescopes, anyone in the world can apply for JWST time!  You just need to write a proposal justifying why *your* idea is better than anyone else's, and well enough that a panel of astronomers agrees.  In practice, it's really competitive, and about 4.5x more hours were requested than there are literal hours for JWST to observe (actually way better than Hubble which has been closer to 10x- Hubble can only observe on the night half of the Earth's orbit, but JWST has a sun shade so you get almost nonstop observing).  The resulting proposals that won out are all a part of \"Cycle 1\" which begins this week, and you can read all about them [here](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/approved-programs/cycle-1-go). (Cycle 1 includes the Early Release Science projects I discussed above.)\n\nTL;DR: JWST is here, and I can't believe how beautiful it is!\n\nEdit: if you want a neat tool to explore this data, [WorldWide Telescope has software where you can compare the \"before\" and \"after\" for these images!](https://web.wwtassets.org/specials/2022/jwst-release/) Check it out!  And if you *really* want to nerd out, [here is the full commissioning report for JWST](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/jwst/documentation/_documents/jwst-science-performance-report.pdf), which includes a bit more data than was in the press coverage!",

Curved blades give softer bokeh and straight gives better sun-stars.. Here's a great article on the sun-stars made from regular cameras.\n\nhttps://phillipreeve.net/blog/best-lenses-for-sunstars/#5_blades\n\nFor a telescope it's the mirrors that do it, and Hubble gives 4 and Webb gives 6.

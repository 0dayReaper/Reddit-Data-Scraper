Even though I have a bachelor's degree in meteorology I don't consider myself a \"meteorologist\" since I work in aviation (but still use my degree). Although half of my class of 50 went on to grad school so it's not uncommon.\n\nA lot of major network stations have their own radar, and yes some of them are better quality than others. In fact NBC 5 in Dallas recently installed a dual-polarization radar not too longer ago which only a couple TV stations in the county have.\n\nLastly no, not all meteorologists on TV have meteorology degrees. In fact out of my graduating class only 2 went into broadcast meteorology and one no longer does it. Most major market meteorologists have at least bachelor degrees, but I know some people who just have broadcast journalism degrees and got an online meteorology degree. When I tell people I majored in meteorology 95% of the time the first thing they ask is \"oh so you wanted to be on TV?\" Most meteorologists don't choose that path. I'd be happy to answer any other questions, I hope that helps!",

Satellite is a big tool now, and we can see wind currents flowing over the globe, so we can have a great idea of what it's going to do based on the general direction of the wind and cloud formation. It's really hard to say \"hey it's definitely going to rain today because of the barometric pressure and temperature are prime conditions for rain\" then it doesn't rain because it's the freaking weather, man; not the freaking weather man. Granted, meteorology is more accurate now. It's times like these (Harvey and Irma) where meteorology is crucial for survival. But mother nature has a way of keeping us on our toes just when we think we have her figured out. ",

There's far too much farmland. Even if you could, it wouldn't necessarily help- the original species of banana went extinct just a few decades ago, when it was quite possible to have greenhouses.",

            "comment": "\nThe stroboscopic effect occurs when a light source is flashing at a frequency that is synchronized with the rotation speed of the machinery. This creates an optical illusion that makes the machinery appear to be stationary or moving very slowly. This effect can be dangerous in a production environment, as workers may be tempted to reach into machinery or equipment that they believe is not moving.\nTo prevent accidents caused by the stroboscopic effect, it is important for employers to ensure that lighting in the workplace is properly designed and installed. They should also provide training to workers on the dangers of the stroboscopic effect and the importance of not reaching into machinery or equipment that may appear to be stationary.\nThe stroboscopic effect is most likely to occur with low-frequency lighting sources such as fluorescent or neon lights. These types of lights operate by sending electrical current through a gas, which causes it to emit light. The current is typically supplied in pulses or cycles, which can create a flicker or strobe effect at certain frequencies.",

Considering they're pros, the fractal is already well-known and they probably have good software for that... Hell if I know, I'd bet it'd be 1 to a few days :D",

If that's indeed the case, then they might've still needed some groundwork just to put that inside houdini.",

From there you can keep it as a volume or convert to geometri and write out as an alembic or render straight in Houdini. Been playing around with it myself lately, good fun!

In actual fact it's an art film about Christs birth which is quite unique because every frame of the film was re-shot via Polaroid resulting in a very distinct look (imagine the time consumption!) Not as nearly as dark as it seems from this video.\n\nI can't recommend Lorn enough if you want to explore something a bit darker musically. He's a turntablist turned synth head and has had an amazing musical journey from Brainfeeder hiphop to etheral ambience.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lGPxDRa3vo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TklnYdpEiME\n\n\n",

Something about *how alien* the aliens are just feels so right--because it feels so bizarre and, well, *alien.*\n\nI thought Contact was stellar, I really loved Arrival, Interstellar is epic, and those are some of the best \"first contact\" movies I've seen... until I saw Annihilation and now I've got a totally new standard.",

Though Annihilation will always rank very high (best cinematic depiction of the weird literature genre I've seen), I thought Arrival was a better film.  The emotional core of the story was better written and more effective due to the mechanics of the plot reveal.  Much more emotionally affecting.  I'd rank it a bit higher.  The emotional heart of the story was better crafted.  Interstellar is a distant third.  A very good movie, but mawkish and heavy handed, emotionally.",

Coming to think of it, I associate \"Annihilation\" somewhat with \"2001\", and the monolith scenes' music, which was also not composed for that or any movie, had a similar effect on me almost 20 years ago.",

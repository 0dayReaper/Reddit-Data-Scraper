The cloud is weightless by definition because of buoyancy. \n\nThe analysis presented in the BBC article isn't really fair either.\n\nClouds are weird because they have quite hard edges, but at a deeper level they are part of a smooth continuum of moisture content &amp; internal energy (not temperature, because of the phase change). \n\nThe actual mass of the cloud is complicated, because humid air is less dense than dry air, so simply calculating the mass of the liquid water doesn't tell the whole story. Functionally, the cloud doesn't behave like a continuous object (e.g. a brick).\n\nThis is most obvious if you look at a lenticular cloud formed from mountain wave. [The air flows through the cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhT6IoHs8Sw). The cloud is effectively a plot of relative humidity &gt;100%; it's very much not a lump of cotton wool.\n\nThe other classical proof of this is [the cloud fighter jets sometimes drag around the sky around them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_cone).",

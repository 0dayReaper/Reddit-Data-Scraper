What got me to stop was regular balance exercises and consciously changing the way I walk. Its bot about telling yourself \"align your feet\", though; that's really hard to do and just causes stress. You need a simple thing you can do with every step to make sure your toes are pointing straight. For me, my physio said to always brush my heels against each other. Every step, just make sure i feel the heel of one foot lightly brush up against the other. For you, idk, maybe brush the balls of your feet together instead? That kinda sounds like a tripping hazard to me. If you can afford even one trip to a physiotherapist, I'd recommend it.",

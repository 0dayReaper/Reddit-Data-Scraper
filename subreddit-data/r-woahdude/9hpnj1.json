Please take note of a few things:\n\n- We are **NOT** a \"reaction subreddit\".\n\n- We are **NOT** a subreddit about content that is merely interesting or amazing. \n\n- We are **NOT** interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other general subreddits.\n\n- We are specifically made for **psychedelic content**, trippy or mesmerizing stuff that will make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder!\n\n[Here is the full explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_0_-_woahdude_material_only) of what belongs here. You'll notice our definition of trippy is more expansive than the obvious fractals and tie-dye concept, but there's a lot we exclude as well. If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Failure to accept these conditions is grounds for ban. \n\nIf you want examples that exemplify our purpose, check our [WOAHDUDE APPROVED](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/search?q=flair:woahdude&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=new) hall of fame.

Everything there is built around mega road projects and is built in a US style strip-mall or housing development style where nothing connects to anything else and there is only one entrance or exit to an entire complex... which makes logistics and traffic a goddamn nightmare. \n\nI once worked an event where the hotel I was staying at was literally next door to the venue I was working at... I could see it... I mean hell... if you gave me a slingshot I could probably hit my hotel window with a rock... but could I walk home? No way. I had to get in my car and drive 40 minutes through traffic because my hotel was separated from where I was working by 4 2 meter tall fences and a highway. Which meant that I had to drive close to 9 miles through heavy traffic to get to a place that was NEXT DOOR to me. \n\nMalls are more or less the only thing to do there 6 months out of the year because of the extreme heat so your assessment is correct. It's mega highways connecting mega malls together. All the big restaurants and things to do are located inside the malls and they get so busy on a Friday night that I went to a mall once and then decided I would never go back again on a Friday. \n\nI have a ton of positive and excited memories about the place but my day to day life was basically just one unbearable frustration after the next because nothing there works the way you think it should.

These people are prisoners who live in labor camps and are forced to work (literally to death in some cases) in blazing hot temperatures for little to nothing. They're lured in by \"recruiters\" who lie to them, promising good working conditions and fair wages, and then when they arrive they are essentially enslaved and forced to work for food and housing. \n\n\nIt's incredibly inhumane, and is happening *right now*, not 200 years ago.

New year's eve, there would be thousands of people on the beach at times. Over the summer a lot of the expats take a decent vacation and go back home to escape the heat. Even tho I understand you went during Eid (right after Ramadan which is the time Dubai is most dead during the day), the majority of the crowds won't be in most common places. So yeah, if you wanna visit Dubai see it in the winter when it's peak tourist season, the city changes entirely with amount of livelihood that occurs. ",

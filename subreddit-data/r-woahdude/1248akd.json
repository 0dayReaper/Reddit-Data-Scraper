You can see it a lot clearer when you look at the text based ai stuff, where it turns out whole paragraphs are lifted from not well known authors works. You can also see it more literally by using prompts like 'make a botticelli of a vase and some fruit\" in which youll get something that looks very like a botticelli in style. If you think that this doesnt apply to all the things you dont recognise as a particulr atrist you are mistaken",

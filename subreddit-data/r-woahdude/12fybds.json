It can reveal or expose things that you have been missing or have been lying to yourself about. You may see new patterns and make connections to things that probably have no actual connection. But the result can be introspective and beautiful. It can also be deadly. If you have a predisposition to mental illness, tripping can bring it out. I used to encourage people to trip but the hard truth is that its not for everybody, I've learned that the hard way. Sorry for the rant, bottom line is get a trip sitter and make sure you're in the right frame of mind. And be honest with yourself.",

Now I keep forgetting which one is which but in general you need to ensure that your environment is right, and your approach is right.  \n\n\nIf you want a good trip the best way to make it more likely to happen is to sit yourself in a space you find cozy or calming, somewhere where you're comfortable. (Good plan is to take the substance, and as you wait for it to kick in, go on a walk in nature.)  \nThis applies to people too, make sure your company is good friends you trust, and preferably at least one sober person! in case something goes wrong or you need someone to answer the door. Believe me it's really hard to pretend to be a person when you're one with the universe. \n\n \nNow your approach is also important. What psychedelics do is take your mind and give it a nice shake, scramble, bit of a nudge, and a twist, they don't exactly *add* anything new, what you will see is already somewhere inside that skull of yours, but new perspectives and connections will emerge out of that information for sure. That's why it's important to go into the experience with the right frame of mind - possitive, open approach of \"show me what you got\", you *definitely* don't want to go in feeling afraid or after a bad day, just take your time.\n\nAnd honestly personally I feel like it's good to simply - let go. I've heard some people are afraid of what the drugs can do to them and resist their effects (you never fully lose control of your mind), and I know it's a personal journey for everyone but the moment when I realised \"This is a temporary experience, I'm safe among friends, and this will wear off in a couple of hours\" I was able to fully let go and delve deeper into the ego death I was in the middle of at that point.\n\nIt's life changing",

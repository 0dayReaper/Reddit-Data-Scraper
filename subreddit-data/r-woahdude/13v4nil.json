For this to be shutter speed would have to be spraying out crazy fast, assuming its 30 FPS, each \"wave\" of liquid would need to be spraying out a similar rate. The container isn't pressurized and any liquid spraying that fast would be going everywhere. Plus it appears to be super viscus, so doubt it would move that fast.",

Just think intuitively do you know any liquid that spreads out in the air as its poured? Could you get honey or another viscus liquid to make this pattern? Why is the liquid in the container a dark brown color whereas the wavy liquid is clear? Why can you see a dark brown column underneath the wavy liquid (its the liquid in the unedited video showing through the CGI).",

However, there was some evidence of an increased risk of AML for applicators, particularly in the highest category of glyphosate exposure compared with never users of glyphosate.](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/110/5/509/4590280?login=false)\n\n2017, *Health Canada*: [**Glyphosate is of low acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity**. It is severely irritating to the eyes, non-irritating to skin and does not cause an allergic skin reaction. Registrant-supplied short and long term (lifetime) animal toxicity tests, as well as numerous peer-reviewed studies from the published scientific literature were assessed for the potential of glyphosate to cause neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, chronic toxicity, cancer, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and various other effects. The most sensitive endpoints for risk assessment were clinical signs of toxicity, developmental effects, and changes in body weight. The young were more sensitive than the adult animals. However, the risk assessment approach ensures that the level of exposure to humans is well below the lowest dose at which these effects occurred in animal tests. ... **When used according to revised label directions, glyphosate products are not expected to pose risks of concern to the environment.**](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/consumer-product-safety/reports-publications/pesticides-pest-management/decisions-updates/registration-decision/2017/glyphosate-rvd-2017-01.html)\n\n2016, *World Health Organization*: [\"In view of the absence of carcinogenic potential in rodents at human-relevant doses and the absence of genotoxicity by the oral route in mammals, and considering the epidemiological evidence from occupational exposures, the Meeting concluded that **glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet.**\"](http://www.who.int/foodsafety/jmprsummary2016.pdf)",

Objectively speaking, crop yields are way higher with the use of herbicides and pesticides. That's why people use them, despite the fact that they cost money, as opposed to doing nothing, which costs nothing. For the vast majority of human history, the crop yield (or the lack thereof) was one of the most, if not the most, restrictive parameters for human life. We've been trying to kill unwanted plants as long as we've been farming.",

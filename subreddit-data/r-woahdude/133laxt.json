Visually the light could look the same color, but the reflected light off objects can look really different.\n\nImagine if you had a purple light made of blue and right lights mixed, if you had an object that absorbs all blue light, the object would look red with the light on. Under a light that made true purple light it would just reflect the purple light.\n\nThere's a cool video by Technology Connections in YouTube where they show off this difference, its pretty trippy",

A fluorescent object reemits the light at a lower wavelength, if we can see the lower wave length well, the object would become more noticeable since invisible light is being turned visible and so more total visible light is coming off the object, but if you can already see that color, you wouldn\u2019t notice glowing as much.\ufffc Some objects can fluoresce under light completely \ufffcvisible to humans, like violet or blue or even green light and they don\u2019t look noticeable different.",

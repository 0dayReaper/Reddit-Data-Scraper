We have monocular and binocular neurons and the latter are activated when we focus both eyes at once to see a 3D image. She was wall-eyed as a child (an issue with one of her  extraocular muscles) and thus could not focus to get a binocular image. She had corrective surgery at 7 years old and was able to stimulate those neurons. It didn't last and she lost it. She was literally only seeing out of her (I think left) focused eye. I mean her eyes were both taking in input but she was only seeing the images from the one eye. Her world was flat, monovision. She could only perceive depth using binocular cues that you can see with monocular vision like movement to create a sense of depth. In her 50s she started to do vision therapy to strengthen her eye muscles and force them to focus her vision.\n\nIt's insane. She went from a flat dull world to a 3D stereoscopic world filled with depth and layers. Excuse me if I've made any errors, it's been a few years since I read the book (The Mind's Eye by Sacks, he dedicated a chapter to Sue but the entire book is amazing and probably in my personal top 10 best books ever.) \n\nLemme know if you need anything clarified!",

I have scar tissue on my left retina creating a large gap in my field of view, including over the fovea, so I only have peripheral vision in my left eye. \n\nI get around just fine, but when I read about stuff like this, or the neurologist who had his binocular vision click into place while watching a 3D movie, it makes me wonder if I'm really getting the full experience.",

I've read TMWMHWfaH, and I've got a couple others on my shelf, but not *The Mind's Eye*.\n\nI don't mind talking about it! I wouldn't have brought it up if I did. Essentially, if I close my right eye, there's a big gap in the middle of my field of view. With both eyes open, that gap is covered by my right eye, but with the right eye closed, all I see is (left to right) peripheral vision, then the inside of my right eyelid, then a bit more peripheral vision.\n\nImagine your vision as if you were standing in front of two large picture windows with a bit of the frame separating the two panes. With most people, it's as if they were standing right in front of the middle brace, and getting an equal view out of both windows. With me, it's like I'm standing just to the right of the brace, seeing much more out of the right-hand window than the left. \n\n\nLike I said, my right eye covers the gap, but I'm always sort of vaguely aware of the phenomenon. For example, my nose is always in the left half of my field of view, no matter what I do. And I've noticed that I unconsciously tend to look just to the right of a camera, because I'm using my right eye to look at it--pointing my nose at a camera *feels* wrong to me, even though I know it's not.\n\nWith just my left eye, I could see just well enough to avoid bumping into things, but I couldn't pick an individual out of a crowd, and I couldn't read anything beyond recognizing that there is something there to read. But with both eyes, I can see plenty well enough to read, drive, and so on. My vision isn't great, but it's not terrible either. It sounds like Dr. Sacks had it much worse than I do.\n\nIt's probably about time for my annual eye exam. I haven't specifically asked them to test for binocular vision--maybe I should.",

In essence, /u/Mescallan was right about them being happy - if they're in abundance, it means conditions are right for them to thrive. But they always luminesce because that's their defensive strategy against predators (predators either get scared away or a bigger fish is notified that the predator is there and comes and eats the predator). Agitation triggers that response. They have short lifespans, and blooms are short, so it makes sense that you could see bioluminescence one day but not the next.",

The clouds look like the are being created because the lightning is shining on the clouds after they have moved, thus added new bright pixels to the photo stack. \n\nI used it mainly for still photos, but the go pro software will let you make timelapse videos and as long as the exposure is long enough, it will come out like this. \n\nEdit: a previous example I took a few years ago\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/oN987eH",

There are lower cost bodys but you're saving $100 for an additional $200 of frustration. the A5100  can be had for $300ish. which will be similar to the other but a little less ergonomic in layout and design.\n\nSo 300ish for cheap body, 200ish for a wide lens off b&amp;h photo, $20 for a cheap tripod and you're there. \n\nexample recomended body https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1029861-REG/sony_ilce6000_b_alpha_a6000_mirrorless_digital.html\n\nexample cheaper body with good image results https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1204012-REG/sony_alpha_a5100_mirrorless_digital.html\n\n\nexample cheaper lens https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1080321-REG/samyang_sy12m_e_bk_12mm_f2_0_ultra_wide.html?sts=pi\n\nHope this helps",

But if you don't want to invest $2000-$10000, you can get away with a GoPro or cheaper DSLR camera. \n\nThe go pro is nice because you can set it, leave it to do it's thing, and come back in a few hours. Ideally, the photos would be over 3-10 hours to get the full effect. \n\nI've left gopros around my city to do this before, and they are small enough, easy to hide that they don't get taken. Also, if they do get taken, it's only a GoPro and not a pro DSLR that costs several months of pay. ",

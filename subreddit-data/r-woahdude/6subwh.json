Trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during\u00a0winds. As the result of abrasions and collisions, there is an induced crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbors until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.[10]If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.[11]This explanation explains instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism\n\nTL:DR: As the ends of branches hit each other from wind the ends are broken off. Further in the article it says that this breaking could inhibit further growth as it damages the growth cells.",

Most theories and studies suggest that abrasion between trees causes pruning or inhibits growth, or that shade detection mechanisms inhibit overlap. More importantly, it's thought that many mechanisms exist depending on species, geography, and the purpose of shyness. Inhibition of parasite migration is more of a niche theory.",

There are even bifurcations of the \"no anemone's land.\"\n\nThis is due to the anemones triggering each other cnidocytes when they are not a fellow clone. I wonder if there is potentially an offensive mechanism at play here.",

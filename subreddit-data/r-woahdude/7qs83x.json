I was in high school in the late 90s, and was going through a phase where I listened to hair band ballads way too much, and had re-fallen in love with all of the coming of age teen movies that were pumped out in that decade. Needless to say it made me super-cool. Any way, I was out for a walk one day, and ran into my crush. She been walking on the other side of the road, so I did my best Frogger impression and jaywalked. Unfortunately, a cop saw me, and arrested me before I could even say hello. Also, unfortunately because it was a small town, all the locals knew about dumb me and my dumb me crime. So one ticket and a reputation for being a sad-sack scofflaw later I was feeling pretty salty about the world. I was stuck in my own head for a few days, but was startled out of it on a walk home, seeing the self-same crush walking across the street. Naturally, I looked both ways, and crossed again. Unfortunately this was the early days of the crown Vic unmarked cop cars, and the same police officer pulled me over again. The fucker was trying not to smile\n \nThere's not a lot to do in this town, so I was deemed worthy to be brought in to jail until my mom could bail me out. I think they just wanted to see the talking to. Well anyway, the only other guy in the cell was this 6\"13' tall motherfucker who was clearly having some withdrawal issues and track marks to compliment his tattoos. He said I had 'a pretty dick', and asked if we could be friends. I said no, and backed away, holding eye contact. That was a mistake. Anyway, so 80's slang is pretty cool, and I'm glad we still have it, even ironically, to this day.",

It's messy and tangled like spaghetti, and often the pics show red ash-related tinting. There is also a crapload of it going off, more than even a tornado storm. You'd have to long-exposure a normal storm to get a comparable strike volume. Lightning coming off wildfire plumes tends to resemble volcano lightning on a smaller scale.\n\n* [Volcano](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/15/article-2539941-1AAF4C2E00000578-852_964x616.jpg)\n* [Volcano](https://i.imgur.com/jPMUjnx.png)\n* [Volcano](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/photos/000/317/31752.ngsversion.66b52ee5409e43e9a5390aedf06d68ee.jpg)\n* [Volcano](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/2e/48/56/2e48560258a7981245e33b721f288869--erupting-volcano-lightning-storms.jpg)\n* [Storm](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/N2dKxTt.jpg)\n* [Storm](https://static3.businessinsider.com/image/54aaa63569bedde43f870503/incredible-photo-montage-shows-the-greek-island-of-ikaria-being-pummeled-by-an-intense-lightning-storm.jpg)\n* [Storm](https://www.naturettl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/main-how-to-photograph-lightning-900x600.jpg)\n* [Storm](https://i.redd.it/h4yjax05pe2z.jpg)",

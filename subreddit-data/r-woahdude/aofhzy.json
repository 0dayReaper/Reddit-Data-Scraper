At the correct perspective, there is a consistent, *flat* white border, not dissimilar to most modern art galleries - your brain will fixate on the sole area of colour because of this, and it seems more vibrant. As you move around from that point, more texture is added to the border, and different colours will now border each other. There are additional shadows, and light bouncing off at different angles now.\n\nIf you remember the colour wheel, contrasting colours will be picked out more strongly from one another by your eye, effectively due to frequency response of the rods and cones (i always mix up which does light/dark vs colour). In addition, your brain is trying to pick out shadows and shapes from complementary colours (e.g. greens and yellows) and will sort of amplify those differences as well, especially if there are hints of shadow and the like.\n\nThe shadows \"trick\" your eye the same way many optical illusions do. As such, moving to positions where darker colours or shadows no longer intersect between lighter ones, your brain can directly compare those colours and potentially see one blue as less intense than another (or less intense than another bluish colour). On the other hand, much like with the white border, sections that now have hard white lines between them will be compared to the white and darker colours seen with more vibrancy as your brain effectively turns the contrast up to pick out information. Light hues will 'wash out' against the white.\n\nTl;dr:\nYour brain is lazy, but has evolved to try and pick out detail amongst confusing visual information, especially for camouflaged predators or prey. It takes shortcuts in visual processing so that you can respond quickly, and therefore doesn't see the 'true' image until you break perspective or lighting.",

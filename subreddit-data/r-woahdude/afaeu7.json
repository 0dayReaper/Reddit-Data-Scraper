Please take note of a few things:\n\n- We are **NOT** a \"reaction subreddit\".\n\n- We are **NOT** a subreddit about content that is merely interesting or amazing. \n\n- We are **NOT** interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other general subreddits.\n\n- We are specifically made for **psychedelic content**, trippy or mesmerizing stuff that will make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder!\n\n[Here is the full explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_1_-_woahdude_material_only) of what belongs here. **You'll notice our definition of trippy is more expansive than the obvious fractals and tie-dye concept, but there's a lot we exclude as well.** If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed.

You technically have to jump off all four to get your base pin: Buliding, Antenna, Span and Earth.  He did all four.  Illegally jumped off a fucking building in downtown Dallas at 2am.\n\nAnyway, he was hiking in Arizona about two years ago, slipped and fell off a fucking cliff.  All the wild shit he did, and he died fucking hiking.  Still makes me mad.",

Blue tornado and similar rides are carefully designed so that you never go over 5g and you only do 5g for like half a second, and people sometimes black out for that duration, since they're not trained to withstand high g. \n\nIf you know what expect, you can clench your stomach (as if when forcing the blood into your face) and that alone can help you withstand more gs, as you're pushing the blood back into your head. \n\nAnyway, if that was 5g, he'd exit the catapult doing ~20m/s (I'm estimating he was accelerating for ~400ms) which is 72km/h, and I don't think that was 72km/h. So I estimate that he was tanking 3g tops. ",

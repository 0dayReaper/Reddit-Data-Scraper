Realistically there are many ways to change color, but I've only seen animals do that (chameleons, cephalopods, etc) and not plants. Then, there are animals that don't change color, just reflect/refract light like a prism (most reptiles but notably ones like the Brazilian rainbow boas, White lipped pythons, and Reticulated pythons).\n\nThen there are metals, pigments, and paints that can \"color-shift,\" of that I most certainly do not know the mechanics. If I had to guess, this video is either fake or the plant is doing this- color-shifting. At least that's what it reminds me of. \n\nThough I could be wrong, I don't know everything of course, hehe xD \ud83d\ude01",

It's highlighting your blood.\n\nIn this case, there is no blood in the plant to highlight... And plants usually have a white, green, clear, or opaque sap. Trees usually have a thicker, goopy sap, and like maples, it is often a warm honey color.\n\nAlso, light shining through a finger looks different than this, it almost glows. This however, is a different color than you'd expect and is clearly happening on the outside layer of the plant, and it appears to \"shift\" color, unlike the finger. This is far more similar to something like reflection or refraction.",

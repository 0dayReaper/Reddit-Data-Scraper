I'm happy with it because it's my first work of my astrophotography trip in this island.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf interested you can find more of my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tinmar_g/?hl=fr)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo for this timelapse I was in the caldera of tenerife which correspond to the Teide national parc, there the landscape are desertic and shaped like martian ones. I park my rental van on a parking and go for a litle night walk to find this composition  with the rocks and the Milky Way. \n\nTenerife is a good place for astrophotography, even if it's not the best sky quality (because of cities belows), the caledera is quite high with around 2500m and is always above a sea of \u200b\u200bclouds that protect it from artificial light of the cities that are under the clouds. I got a good experience there but It was not always easy to do astrophotography there because even if it's allowed to do it there, the legislatiion about it is quite blurry and depending of the rangers they do not apply the same forbiddings.\n\nFor the timelpase I shot 375 pictures at 30 sec intervals. I've added a reverse effect at the end of the video to have more time to enjoy the Milky Way.\n\nEquipment : Canon 6D - Sigma ART 20mm  \nSettings : ISO-2500 - F/2 - 25 sec",

SpaceX just launches more rockets than anyone else, and the falcon is fairly large so if you notice a huge plume its probably them. Its called the [Twilight Phenomenon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_phenomenon) because it happens around dusk or dawn. \n\nWhats happening is that the exhaust cloud (in the Falcon 9 case the exhaust is water and CO2) freezes and expands at high altitude, where sunlight from over the horizon lights it up against a dark sky. Hence the name twilight phenomenon, you can only see it like this when the light hits just right.",

The sun was below the horizon for the observer, but the rocket went high enough to become illuminated by sunlight, which is what makes the exhaust plume visible.\n\nAny rocket will produce this effect. Here\u2019s an [Atlas V launch at twilight](https://youtu.be/W8sXUkafO9k?t=1m55s), for example.\n\nThe reason the exhaust plume looks messy in the Falcon 9 launch is because the first stage booster flipped around after separation and fired its engines again in order to travel back to land near the launch site. This maneuver causes the exhaust from the first &amp; second stage engines to interact. Here\u2019s a [close up view of that event](https://youtu.be/p50bX0q5-bo?t=2m50s) filmed in real time from an alternate angle.",

Quick and easy to set up for another launch with minimal costs compared to NASA's larger rockets that have very few reusable components. It's one reason SpaceX can launch these on just about a weekly basis if needed. Not sure how many Falcon rockets they currently have built, but after some post-flight refurbishing, they are ready to be used again. So they could easily have a bunch waiting in line and can pull them whenever they need to send something up.\n\nI'm also impressed they can strap these together to make the Falcon Heavy rockets! Instead of making a whole new heavy-lifting rocket design, they just made the Falcon Heavy modular, using three smaller Falcon9 rockets (again, most likely previously used) as engines. It's genius! Looking forward to the other rocket designs they are testing and have in the conception stages.",

Running very rich and leading to unburnt fuel making its way to the exhaust and therefore able to be lit by a spark plug back there.  Backfires are also examples of this, with the exhaust being so hot it can ignite unburnt fuel in the exhaust.  So backfires are either the case of purposeful/accidentally rich a/f ratio or improper burning in the cylinders leading to unspent fuel (maybe bad spark plug(s))",

For chemical reactions, the actual discrete molecules matter, so everything is done in ratios of moles. A mole is a unit that denotes a specific number of particles (6.022 \\* 10 \\^22). Stoichiometry is basically stuff like \"you take 2 moles of this and react it with 4 moles of that to get 1 mole of product\". You can almost think of a stochiometric relation like the recipe for a reaction, or the law governing it.",

The amount of carbon monoxide produced in this case is typically very small and is not a significant source of pollution.\n\nRocket engines that use RP-1 as a fuel are typically designed to minimize the amount of carbon monoxide produced during combustion. This is achieved through optimization of the fuel-to-air mixture to ensure complete combustion of the RP-1.\n\nSource: I'm a huge science nerd with a subscription to GPT4\n\n\nEdit: so yes, akchually you're quite right, CO is indeed produced but at such miniscule amounts that it's negligible",

Taking RP-1 to be C12H14 on average, this is a mole ratio of 11.67. Again, taking RP-1 to be C12H14, complete combustion would require 15.5 as the LOX/RP-1 mole ratio.\n\n I also did this for the Raptor, and the stoichiometry can be done more precisely with the info I have since the fuel there is methane. The Raptor runs a LOX/Methane ratio of 3.6. This is a mole ratio of 1.78 LOX/Methane. Complete combustion would require 2.\n\nI imagine these are run fuel rich to keep the combustion chamber temperature down a bit and also keep unreacted oxygen from corroding the hell out of the combustion chamber and nozzle.",

People do it to get money to family overseas without paying transfer fees, or money order fees and the like.\n\nEdit: as pointed out below, I got this mistaken. This is likely people attempting to avoid declaring money, not to avoid fees.",

A few countries like China limit how much you can leave with (without a permit), but most countries don't, rather they just require you declare it to crack down on money laundering/organized crime. For most countries that amount is usually around $10 000. Above that, you just have to declare it, but there isn't an upper limit. \n\nSource, I've flown plenty of times with in excess of $10K on me. Customs just counts it, makes you sign a declaration of where you earned it, and sends you on your way (though I'd be less inclined to try this in third world countries, but that's not for legal reasons, just a hedge against unscrupulous customs officers).",

Our tips were paid in cash, and might accumulate since I'd only go home once or twice a year which meant that I'd often be over the 10K limit when I flew home. \n\nUsually that was far more convenient than trying to find a local place that would accept a large sum of cash from a foreigner and then send it to my bank. Any place that would do that is going to charge an exorbitant fee, and my banks rarely had locations in the places I was working. \n\nBank to bank transfers are pretty easy and can be quite cheap if done right, but cash to bank is a nightmare if you don't already have an account, for obvious reasons. My home branch knew me so depositing large sums of cash didn't raise any eyebrows (though I'm certain it was all reported to our local financial anti-money laundering agencies as was legally required). \n\nHonestly, the worst was one time I declared it, and the customs agent sorting people for secondary screening thought I ticked the wrong box and very loudly confirmed if I was carrying more than 10K. The idiot announced it to the whole arrival department, instead of quietly directing me to secondary screening. \n\nThe customs agents at secondary screening were pretty chill. Apparently it's reasonably common for people to travel with six figures in cash from places like Vegas so I was just a small fish with my measly 5 figures. It usually wouldn't take more than 5 minutes to count it, document it and send me on my way. One time I had about eight different currencies one me and they just ignored any that were under a few hundred dollars. \n\nAnd this was when I was in my early 20s, and my passport was stamped full of countries known for drug smuggling and organized crime, thought I had pretty good proof of my employment and where it came from in the form of letters of employment from the master of the vessel, a seaman discharge book, and a solid record that most of those stamps were from a maritime port of entry.\n\nPeople are always afraid of things like declaring money, however it's really no big deal if you just follow the proper declarations.",

Of course, because of aliasing you will see a stopped rotor at all integer multiples and some divisors of the rated motor speed -- and also possibly at seconds, thirds, fourths, etc. of the integers due to odd/even circular symmetry of whatever you're strobing, like the motor fan, for example.\n\nBut when you really nail the rated speed it's incredible how stationary it looks. One of the big warnings on the strobe is to exercise extreme caution when you have locked onto the rated motor speed, since guys will simply forget you're looking at a motor going around thousands of times a minute and will try to touch its seemingly stationary surface to point something out.",

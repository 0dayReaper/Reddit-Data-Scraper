(Ukrainian Operative Commandment South) considered flooding the river. The Ukrainians, he said, even conducted a test strike with a HIMARS launcher on one of the floodgates at the Nova Kakhovka dam, making three holes in the metal to see if the Dnieper\u2019s water could be raised enough to stymie Russian crossings but not flood nearby villages.\n\nThe test was a success, Kovalchuk said, but the step remained a last resort. He held off.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/12/29/ukraine-offensive-kharkiv-kherson-donetsk/",

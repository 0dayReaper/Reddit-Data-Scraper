Since the green is layered on, it looks very smooth because it's completely covering the texture of the paper. It can blend with the white smoothly because most of the white highlights aren't actually white, but rather a very light green, which is also covering the texture of the paper. The \"paint\" part of the image has all hard edges, so there's no need to try and blend it with the paper.\n\nBasically, the paper has a bunch of tiny pits in it that give it texture. When you draw on it with pencils like Primsas, those pits get filled and covered with colored wax and the surface ends up smooth.\n\nIf you tilted the paper at and angle with a light pointed at it, you would actually see the light reflect off of the drawing because of how smooth the surface is.\n\nHowever, the cast shadow fades directly into the paper, so we're seeing the texture of the paper come through, as the pencil isn't filling in and covering all of the texture of the paper, which results in the graininess we see.\n\nThis image is also low resolution, so we've lost a lot of texture detail to image compression. Compression artifacts have obliterated texture details.",

Sure, I'm proud of my work and the way things I make turn out because of how much effort I put into it, but it doesn't feel like art.

You force your brain to do these seemingly mechanical things that aren't artistic so that it intrinsically does these things. It frees up brain power so you can then focus on another aspect. This principle applies to progressing in everything. \n\nYou spend today trudging through drawings but some times you'll catch yourself doodling something quite impressive or incorporating something you've done numerous times in the past to something new. That is art. People don't want to accept that artistic skill requires rigidity but it does. The creativity comes later. Like 'a bolt of lightning', as they say. It can't strike if you're not present (or in this case, drawing). ",

They draw a vague thing, then try to refine it into a circle. They make a shape, then go \"eh, let's see. Hm... that side looks a bit flat, lemmie erase it. Ah that's better, but now that side looks even more off...\" and then five minutes later you have a circle.",

So I suppose in something like like calligraphy or whatever you learn to make art in very purposeful, practiced, pat stokes.

It's like if you saw someone sitting on a 4-wheeled cart and you went, \"man, I can't even ride a unicycle.\"",

Sketch it out lightly then color it in carefully. \n\nEdit: [I did a quick sample](https://imgur.com/gallery/u1W0v) using 4 color (markers, no pencils on hand). It's not perfect but it gets the point across. Don't recommend marker, you need pencil for this. ",

Like, it looks like a glob, but it's done with unglobbed paint.\n\nHow is that different from a glob of paint?\n\n&gt; Well, it looks shiny and textured, but not because the paint is shiny and textured, but the painting of the paint is shiny and textured. Not that the paint used to paint the paint isn't shiny and textured itself, had you smacked a glob of of it on the canvas instead of painting a glob of paint on the canvas, but in the painting the paint is shiny, but it only looks shiny, not that it is shiny in the painting.",

The shades, shadows and highlights in something most people wouldn't even take a second glance at.\n\n This what good art really can show us, that even small insignicant things can be full of intricate little details. It's all about perspective.",

IIRC (and in a layman presentation), Molly and family overload the fuck out of your Serotonin receptors (what reacts to serotonin), which causes your receptors lower their sensitivity, which means you need more Serotonin than normal to be at your baseline happy once the drug isn't impacting you anymore. This type of mechanism is why tolerance is a thing. IIRC, with molly, you don't reset your tolerance to \"normal\" until around 3 months after, but most regular users will say that two weeks is generally when you feel \"normal\" again (using fake numbers to explain, it's like it takes 2 weeks to get 90% of the way there to \"normal\" and another 3 months to get that last 10%). Regular users will say that 2 weeks is all you need to do the drug again with typical doses rather than double or even triple dosage you'd need if you just did it 24 hours later.",

This looks like a 300-400ug trip of real LSD, which is huge. People don't realize that blotters sold on the street as 150ug are most probably between 25 and 75ug max (sometimes a lot less than that), which is why you often hear people saying they had a nice trip after taking 3 whole blotters. \n\nWith real dosage of LSD, doses as low as 50ug can already feel quite strong and create nice hallucinations, thought loops etc. I bought LSD on the deep web and took 50ug for the first time, it was awesome and a really nice trip. My biggest dose was 200ug and boy that was very intense, with vivid visuals looking almost like this video. You really don't need more than 400ug to achieve that. (realistically, 400ug would be even more intense than that, with an almost total disconnection from the outside world).\n\nWith doses higher than 500ug you won't even recognized simple objects around you anymore and your whole perception may become infinite fractals for a few hours.",

I wouldn't ride a bike though, it's not safe for others or yourself.\n\nA much better way to get visuals like this would be to smoke Changa, maybe with a little ketamine already in your system.\n\nDissociatives + psychedelics = what people thought psychedelics were like before taking them.",

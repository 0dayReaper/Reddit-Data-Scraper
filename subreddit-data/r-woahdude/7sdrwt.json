This diver has achieved \u201cNeutral Buoyancy\u201d which, also as you said, is incredibly easy to do in scuba because you have a BCD. \n\nIn my opinion, \u201cNeutral Buoyancy\u201d is probably the closest feeling one can get to being in space at zero g. The main difference being the increased resistance to movement because of the water density. Other than that, when you\u2019re in that state you\u2019re essentially weightless and it\u2019s an amazing feeling. ",

They have only the air that was originally in their lungs. Scuba divers breathing air or mixes with nitrogen are at risk of narcosis. They spend way more time at depth and breathe lots of gas, way more gas than that single lungful a free diver has.  \n\nSource: friends decided to bounce 70 meters on air. Got narc'ed and spent a minute laying on the bottom acting goofy, looking up at the things above them. Fortunately their computers alerted them to the need to ascend and they barely had enough air to get up with a proper deco schedule.",

The beauty of skindiving is you simply can just go to the surface when you run out of air. With SCUBA, in an emergency, unless you\u2019re doing a shallow dive, it\u2019s very dangerous just to pop to the surface. Decompression sickness is no joke. \n\nI used to dive a lot (~200 dives), but unless I\u2019m doing an deep wreck or something extraordinary, I\u2019d honestly rather just skindive a shallow reef.",

They'd \"dance\" juuuust inside visual range of you.  Coming into view, and then back out again.  I swam backwards the entire time flailing my flashlight around in every direction.  \n\nOn the plus side we saw an octopus.",

I was really freaked out sitting in the dark water, ready to descend, but once we started swimming I felt really calm for some reason, like we were just another predator sneaking around in the night. Then once we got to the bottom, our fin kicks would light up all the bioluminescence and we were able to shut our flashlights off and just swim through the sparkles. It felt like a dream. The only real freaky part was a 6 foot barracuda that swam up uncomfortably close to check out our flashlights. 10/10 would go again.",

The boat drops you off at point A, you drift with the current (often along a reef) and come up at (approx) point B where the boat meets you.  You can either trail a surface marker buoy (SMB) with you from the start, or you raise one at the end - they are brightly coloured so the boat skipper can see you more easily.  I also used to carry a collapsible flag which I could wave if I was far from the boat.\n\nedit:  it's a great way to dive - you use hardly any air so drift dives can last longer than normal dives, but if you see something interesting along the way stopping to look can be almost impossible if the current is strong enough.  But it's very exhilarating especially if there is a a lot of surface swell too because you move in two directions - with the current and up and down with the swell, like a leaf in the wind.",

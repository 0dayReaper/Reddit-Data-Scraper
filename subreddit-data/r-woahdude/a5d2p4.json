Please take note of a few things:\n\n- We are **NOT** a \"reaction subreddit\".\n\n- We are **NOT** a subreddit about content that is merely interesting or amazing. \n\n- We are **NOT** interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other general subreddits.\n\n- We are specifically made for **psychedelic content**, trippy or mesmerizing stuff that will make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder!\n\n[Here is the full explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_1_-_woahdude_material_only) of what belongs here. **You'll notice our definition of trippy is more expansive than the obvious fractals and tie-dye concept, but there's a lot we exclude as well.** If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Failure to accept these conditions is grounds for ban. \n\nIf you want examples that exemplify our purpose, check our [WOAHDUDE APPROVED](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/search?q=flair:woahdude&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=new) hall of fame.

Then I made a video of a levitating top inside of a bubble that went viral. That video created a lot of demand for the modified ecig I used to make the fog, which led to another small business where I make parts to convert ecigs into bubble fog machines. I also make some other tools for bubble artists. Most of them I design with Fusion 360 and 3D print.",

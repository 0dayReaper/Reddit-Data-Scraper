Please take note of a few things:\n\n- We are **NOT** a \"reaction subreddit\".\n\n- We are **NOT** a subreddit about content that is merely interesting or amazing. \n\n- We are **NOT** interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other general subreddits.\n\n- We are specifically made for **psychedelic content**, trippy or mesmerizing stuff that will make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder!\n\n[Here is the full explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_1_-_woahdude_material_only) of what belongs here. **Our definition of trippy is more expansive than the obvious fractals and tie-dye concept, but there's a lot we exclude as well.** If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Failure to accept these conditions is grounds for ban. \n\nFor examples, check [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/search?q=flair:woahdude&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=new).

Within such a TZ, assuming the conditions above, there would be an area at a comfortable temperature range. Assuming such an area exists (hereafter referred to as AP - \"aight point\"), it would not be stationary because the planet is rotating. \n\nSo you would need to travel forward at a rate equal to Mercury's rotation to remain at the AP. This means you would need to walk at 2.17mph (3.5kph) to move with the AP.\n\n(Before even finishing this post, I found it may be a lot more [complicated](https://cseligman.com/text/planets/mercuryrot.htm) than I thought.)",

This view captures both compositional differences and differences in how long materials have been exposed at Mercury's surface. Young crater rays, arrayed radially around fresh impact craters, appear light blue or white. Medium- and dark-blue areas are a geologic unit of Mercury's crust known as the \"low-reflectance material\", thought to be rich in a dark, opaque mineral. Tan areas are plains formed by eruption of highly fluid lavas. The color base map shown here consists of MDIS images taken through eight different color filters. \n\nSo, it kind of is what you'd see, if you were looking through 8 different color filters, I guess.",

I was very disappointed, and started to look at every space photo with skepticism. I wish major news outlets would put a giant \"Artist Render\" watermark on this kind of photos. Sure there is a tiny grey text under the photo in the article, but it is often lost when people start sharing them across different websites. I think it is a bit deceiving when those enhanced photos are shown by default when a new space related article is published.  ",

To draw an analogy, on a moonless light you might see nothing but a soldier with special night vision equipment can see virtually everything. Also no photo, even a true color one, can really emulate what it would be like to see it directly.",

Maximum warp for Picard's enterprise is warp 9.6 and it can only hold that for like 12 hours.\n\n\nWarp 9 is something like 1,000c but it's variable due to the makeup of the space they travel through (gravity wells etc.)\n\n\nSo at max war I'd the enterprise left earth it'd take around 700 milliseconds to get there.\n\n\nImpulse speed is not really clear. From what I can find online it's probably dependent on the mass of the ship but Voyager had impulse at 2/3 c and the enterprise d shuttles were around 1/40 c so who knows what Picard's impulse was. But it wasn't higher than 1 c I'll say 1/3 to be safe but I have almost nothing to back that up \n\n\nAt full impulse (if we go with 1/3 c) the enterprise will arrive in 35 minutes.\n\n\nSo traveling at max warp to mercury would likely just cause the enterprise to blow past the planet and end up at the next star.\n\n\n\n",

If we use the upper value of this (21,473 x C) and a solar system size of 15 thousand million kilometers across the solar system i.e. 2 x Sol to Pluto ([https://www.universetoday.com/104486/how-big-is-our-solar-system/](https://www.universetoday.com/104486/how-big-is-our-solar-system/) shows 50AU from Sol to Pluto, roughly 7.5x10\\^9km; further out is pretty much stuff the average Joe won't care about) and knowing C is approximately 300,000 km/s we get 7.5x10\\^9 / 6.44x10\\^9 which is roughly 1.15 seconds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn which case Number One, I concur...",

A global color map of Mercury's surface has been created by mosaicking thousands of sets of images obtained by the MESSENGER Wide Angle Camera (WAC). The colors shown here are related to real variations in the spectral reflectance across the planet. This view captures both compositional differences and differences in how long materials have been exposed at Mercury's surface. Young crater rays, arrayed radially around fresh impact craters, appear light blue or white. Medium- and dark-blue areas are a geologic unit of Mercury's crust known as the \"low-reflectance material\", thought to be rich in a dark, opaque mineral. Tan areas are plains formed by eruption of highly fluid lavas. The color base map shown here consists of MDIS images taken through eight different color filters. It is part of a global color map that covers more than 99% of Mercury's surface with an average resolution of about 1 kilometer per pixel.\n\n\nCredit: NASA/Johns Hopkins University \n\nApplied Physics Laboratory/Carnegie \n\nInstitution of Washington.",

If the surface that the asteroid hit was perfectly smooth, this ejecta would be spread uniformly out from the crater, but because the surface is rough (from hills, valleys, craters etc.) the material gets concentrated in a few jets, which are the bright rays in the image.  [Here's](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/why-do-some-impact-craters-have-rays) a good summary that goes into more detail and has some cool videos that show how impacts make rays.\n",

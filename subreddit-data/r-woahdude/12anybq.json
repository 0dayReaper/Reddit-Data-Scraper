Smoke a big joint before you start, it's an hour long.\n\nReich is one of the most popular minimalist composers, and these two pieces are among his early work, which tended to be pretty raw minimalism.\n\nBoth pieces incorporate \"phasing\", which is where two musicians play the same exact pattern over and over again, but one of the musicians plays ever so slightly faster than the other, so that they slowly get out of phase with each other, similar to the video. Piano Phase is literally only phasing, it's two pianos going through one full cycle on a 12 note pattern. Drumming incorporates phasing but is a bit more expansive, with multiple movements on different instruments.\n\nBoth are great for getting into a serious trance. Music For 18 Musicians is another hour-long marathon trance-fest, although that one doesn't incorporate phasing.",

This can be 'easily' done by finding out the interval between swings, T, by manually counting when the ball passes a given fixed point (like the center).  Once T is figured out, you can solve for L, the length of the pendulum. \n\nA similar process could be used for the other balls, -or-an estimate could be made based on the first ball measured.\n\nOnce the formulas are roughly figured out, then all you gotta do is write a program that creates an mp3 based on the 15 formulas you figured out.  Play back the mp3 over the video, check your work until it sounds good enough, then you're good to go.\n\nI have no idea if this it what was done but it's how I'd approach it.",

The differential equation you get if you solve a pendulum is something like dx/dt \u221d sin(x) where X is the angle from the string makes from the strings resting place. This, as far as I'm aware, doesn't have an analytical solution. It is often simplified using the small angle approximation, sin(x) \u2248 x, to get the pendulum equation. This means the equation gets worse for larger angles.",

The approx motion formula for a perfect pendulum is a good starting point.\n\nIf you\u2019re into coding, this is actually a fun and relatively easy exercise you can do yourself. Approximate each of the pendulum to be \u201cideal\u201d pendulums with different lengths, and calculate their time periods based on established formulae. Your coding software will have its tools for sound generation or libraries of sounds that you can later attach to one of the variables in the pendulums, say, the \u201cangular\u201d position of the pendulum (or displacement from lowest point). \n\nI believe in this video, they made the same note each time any pendulum reaches its max endpoint. You can choose the central point to simplify your calculations and the result will sound very similar to this video. \n\nThing about sound is, it is additive, so you can literally run each pendulum simulation individually and then algebraically add all the generated sounds together and merge them into a single sound file that will sound like the grand total of all pendulums together.\n\nThis video sounds great because they used some good added effects on the notes, but the general principle is the same.",

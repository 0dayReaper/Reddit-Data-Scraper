                    "comment": "Underneath the transparent elytra, or 'armour' there are layers upon layers within the cuticle that get thicker and thicker known as a 'chirped multilayer'. These layers are filled with grooves, and when the beetle is undisturbed a fluid fills the grooves of the top layer turning it into a mirror-like surface, giving it a gold appearance. When the beetle is disturbed, the liquid is displaced revealing the true red colour of the beetle on the bottom layers.\n\nInterestingly there really hasn't been any conclusive explanation as to *why* this has evolved, because the full transformation is usually slow (roughly 2 minutes) and therefore not likely to startle predators. One of the more complex explanations is that the reflective appearance causes a glare which makes them harder to spot by birds from afar. In a habitat with a lot of rain, the beetle may seem almost indistinguishable from a raindrop.  If the bird gets close enough it switches to show this red/black spot pattern which might resemble a toxic beetle that birds try and avoid - known as 'batesian mimicry'. Unfortunately there's just not a lot of field data on when the beetle uses this mechanism to fully explain the reason it's evolved.\n\n[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17930271)\n\nEDIT: Apparently someone gave one of these beetles to a bird that had never seen one before, and it found the beetle palatable, but when given a spotless ladybeetle found it distasteful. So there might be some truth behind the batesian theory which would be really cool. [source](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/running-ponies/glad-you-ditched-the-anal-fork-golden-tortoise-beetle/)\n\nTL;DR/ELI5: Beetle pumps liquid into shell to make reflective surface, the glare from which probably makes it hard for birds to see. If birds get close, beetle pumps liquid out of shell to show the true red colour which resembles a poisonous beetle so the bird might try to avoid it.",

Mary (Our Lady) was often depicted wearing a red cloak in early paintings, and the spots of the seven-spot ladybird (the most common in Europe) were said to symbolize her seven joys and seven sorrows. In the United States, the name was adapted to \"ladybug\". Common names in some other European languages have the same association, for example, the German name Marienk\u00e4fer translates to Marybeetle.\n\n",

In fact, they can change color depending on the season or even their mood using the liquid beneath their transparent shell.\n\n\n&gt;Underneath the shell are three layers of cuticle, each covered in tiny nooks and crannies that appear smooth when covered with liquid, and reflect light perfectly like a mirror. But when a golden tortoise beetle is agitated or under attack from a predator, it contracts the spaces between the layers of cuticle and forces liquid out of the grooves \u2014 doing away with the iridescence and usually revealing a brownish-orange color.",

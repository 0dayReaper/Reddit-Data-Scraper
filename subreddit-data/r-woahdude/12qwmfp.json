Mostly we used small glass tubes or silicon wavers filled with water or oil. Instead of speakers, we used piezos, typically one on top and one on the side of the device, so we could get one standing wave horizontally and one vertically. We could do all kinds of stuff with that - sort particles of different sizes / hardness into different channels, move single yeast cells around, remove water from a water+particle mixture really quick, and so on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApplication were mostly medical diagnostics and scientific devices. The coolest one was a device that could take a single yeast cell, and put it into a single drop of water. The idea was that that way you could measure the excretion of just one single cell (which is typically not easy, because you cant really put one cell into one container easily).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe effect that moves stuff is actually pretty easy to create and control. Backyard tinkering level of easy. Just slap two actuators to a tube of hard material, fill it with water, adjust the frequency until you hit the right one, done. Its also very reliable, if the device is set up right. The precision was always more than sufficient. I worked with a decive that focused a stream of thousands of particles at the same time, and i think the precision was maybe 0.2-0.3mm, but if you have single objects it gets better than that. You can also get better precision by using higher-frequency waves (e.g. a standing wave with one node is less accurate than one with two nodes and double frequency) or higher power. The things vibrate a bit though, impractical if you need to be very steady \n\nIt has a bunch of limitations though:\n\n\\- Forces are always very small. We used particles in water/oil, so gravity played next to no rolen, and we could move dense objects like metal particles and yeast. I dont think this could ever be practically used to move \"heavy\" objects, like a metal screw or so. I also dont think it could work in a less sheltered environment, where you could have some wind or anything like that.\n\n\\- The objects need to have a specific density and compressibility, compared to their medium. I think that might be less of an issue with air, since air is on the extreme end. In water, you can only move some materials.\n\n\\- You need an acoustically hard barrier on one side, and a speaker on the other. So no freely floating around in the sky.\n\n\\- the objects must be small compared to the wavelength. So the devicr must always be a lot bigger than the things its trying to manipulate.",

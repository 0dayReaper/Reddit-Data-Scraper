Please take note of a few things:\n\n- We are **NOT** a \"reaction subreddit\".\n\n- We are **NOT** a subreddit about content that is merely interesting or amazing. \n\n- We are **NOT** interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other general subreddits.\n\n- We are specifically made for **psychedelic content**, trippy or mesmerizing stuff that will make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder!\n\n[Here is the full explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_1_-_woahdude_material_only) of what belongs here. **You'll notice our definition of trippy is more expansive than the obvious fractals and tie-dye concept, but there's a lot we exclude as well.** If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Failure to accept these conditions is grounds for ban. \n\nIf you want examples that exemplify our purpose, check our [WOAHDUDE APPROVED](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/search?q=flair:woahdude&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=new) hall of fame.

The effect is that the camera is supposed to be bouncing along on a wire to add to the physicality yet hmm where\u2019s the wire.\n\nNever mind that there\u2019s no sky and the lighting is inconsistent on the apparent objects, they\u2019re not flat scenes they\u2019re individual textures\n\nTLDR the amount of post done on this means it\u2019d be far more effective to model it",

This was probably created using [Photogramatry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) Which creates a 3D model along with a diffuse texture. A camera is then animated to fly along this model with some wiggle and probably with a Zdepth pass to add depth of field using after effects. The loop was probably created by duplicating the model, scaling it down and snapping it to the end of the first model. Source, I'm a 3D artist :P ",

For some reason we only move forward through time but can think and plan in multiple \"directions\" of time. \n\nYour thoughts branch but you have to reach the \"root\" of the thought before you can return to where you branched. The only possible way to progress through the thought tree is forward in time.\n\nProbably sounds crazy but it makes sense to me. It's also how recursion works in programming and how fractals, mountain \"veins\", lightning, trees, etc. are made.",

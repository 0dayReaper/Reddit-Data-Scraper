There are no \"adults,\" and we all need to take responsibility for peace, for nourishment, for security, safety, and rationality.\n\nWe have to talk to our coworkers, our neighbors, our families, and establish working, adult relationships where we can.\n\nAnd, I hate to say it, we have to do it for the rest of our lives.

This makes it much easier to put out. \n\nArkansas uses controlled burns to maintain thousands of acres of health forests. So even in the driest seasons, fires are relatively easily controlled.",

We'll call that first spot that the laser pointer is hitting point A. Now, you move the laser pointer to a different spot on the moon, point B. \n\nIf done quickly enough, the point will have traveled from point A to point B faster than the speed of light. However, the light itself did not travel that distance from A to B, instead traveling from Earth to both A and B separately. \n\nSo, this results in the appearance of something traveling faster than light but there is nothing actually traveling from A to B.\n\nPlease, let me know if any of this is incorrect or not explained properly. I understand the concept but haven't tried explaining it before, so it could be a bit off. Hope I helped!",

If I'm thinking of the same thing you are, dark energy is what you're talking about.\n\nAnd in the same vein as supernovas not going along with our projected calculations, the whole idea of galaxies didn't fit our projections for a time. Based on what we understood, the Milky Way should have torn itself apart a long time ago. So there must be something impacting the galaxies in a manner we don't understand.

So let's say you have an incredibly powerful laser pointer and you point it at one side of the moon, then move it across the face of the moon to the other side. It looks like the laser point on the surface moved across the whole entire moon faster than the speed of light (If moving the diameter of the moon in 0.1 seconds isn't faster than the speed of light, then just imagine some celestial body further out or bigger or something, I can't do the math atm).\n\nBut we know that the speed of light is most likely the fastest anything in the universe can go. The laser speed is still obeying the known laws of physics because the photons that are traveling from the laser to the moon are still only going the speed of light. Nothing is moving from one side of the moon to the other.\n\nOr as /u/Warriorfreak said, [Lighthouse paradox](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_paradox)",

The two numbers could easily divide to be faster than the speed of light and there would be no problem. And the beam would always hit where you pointed it to.

Imagine what the surface of the last donut you ate would have looked like to one of the microbes on it.  \n  \n* The sun and moon are actually approximately the same size. This is true because they should both be as large as possible, yet still fit through the donut hole. Satisfying both constraints explains the apparent coincidence.  \n  \n* You have defeated me. I literally do not understand you.  \n  \n* Shadow size is related to size, not mass. Anyone who has ever eaten a donut knows that not everything is the same density. If you're only eating completely uniform-density donuts, Jesus, set up a GoFundMe -- you need help.",

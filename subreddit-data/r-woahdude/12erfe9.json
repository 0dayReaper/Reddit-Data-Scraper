Look at footage of astronauts walking in spacesuits and they're clearly encumbered but your guy has pep in his step. I know it's a little detail but it's those polished details that really immerse the viewer.\n\nEven slowing the footage of him walking in whatever video editor you use would amp it up.",

Your art was my screensaver for so long and I had no idea who the artist was (remember the times when getting credit for your work even with just a tag on Instagram was almost impossible?) But every once in a while I\u2019d come across one of your paintings on some random Instagram account or something and I knew it was the same unknown artist because your style is just so unmistakable. \n\nI got older and I stopped seeing your work come up as my algorithm started getting more into sports and business stuff, but I still have those screensavers in my photos. I\u2019m so stoked I finally found out who you are!! Gonna have to buy some prints for the apartment after all those years of just having it as my Lock Screen!",

What if.... what if he's not the one doing the dreaming?\n\nWhat if others are the ones dreaming him and that's why he can't \"wake up\"?\n\nA weird SCP dream like anomaly that is shared by humans and all manner of beings capable of dreaming. That's why all of the paintings seem familiar, because he's been in all of them, like a traveler going from one place to another. But when the dreamer wakes up, the memory kinda fades a little, like how when you try to remember a dream you had but the details seem fuzzy. It only \"feels\" familiar.\n\nWhen a dreamer dreams of him, he exists in that time and place within the dream until the dreamer wakes up, and someone new dreams him. But, is the astronaut the anomaly or is it the dream?  Do the dreams create the astronaut or does the astronaut create the dream world? Or is it something else entirely? Maybe something smaller and unseeable that can travel across huge spatial distances that if, and when, it comes into contact with an entity capable of dreaming, it triggers the \"astronaut\"?\n\nBut why him? He speaks English so clearly he's human. Is he real? Was he ever real? How did he become this? And if it his dream, where's his body?\n\nAnd... where's the other one? There's clearly two of them at some point.\n\nI have so many questions...",

All of Yellowstone is on top of an active volcano and is heated from magma under the earth. That sends pressurized steam up into the geysers and hot springs. And, in fact, a lot of the pools are boiling and are constantly bubbling.\n\nSome of the pools also contain bacteria that produce sulfuric acid, so the pools have the pH of battery acid. Although I think that those ones tend to be a lot muddier because the sulfuric acid eats through the rock. \n\nIt\u2019s funny that this post popped up today since I literally just left Yellowstone a few hours ago",

Since the water is also deeper in the middle, it's hotter and therefore absolutely nothing lives there, that's why all you see is clear, blue water. \n\nAs you get further from the center and the water gets less deep, it gets cooler and cooler (but still very hot!). But it's cool enough that thermophiles can actually survive there, so that's why you start to see colors. Each different color is essentially a different environment, so different types of thermophiles live in each layer depending on the temperature they can withstand.",

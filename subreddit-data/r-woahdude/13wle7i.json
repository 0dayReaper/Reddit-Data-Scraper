    "postText": "Tasmania is home to all manner of rare, weird, and wonderful flora. The Miena cider gum (Eucalyptus gunnii subsp. divaricata) is all three.\n\nOn this particular evening, a G4 solar storm arrived. Owing to the Miena cider gum's range being restricted to a few dozen hectares close to Australia's coldest town, fog is not uncommon. Miraculous timing saw an intense auroral display wrapped in heavy fog, a natural softening filter for an otherwise very intense scene.\n\nI shot this on my Sony \u03b17 III with a SAMYANG 14mm f/2.8 lens and SIGMA MC-11 adapter, and of course my trusty Sirui RX-3213 (heat tripod ever, no lie). I proceeded it using a combination of DxO PureRAW, Photoshop, and LRTimelapse.",

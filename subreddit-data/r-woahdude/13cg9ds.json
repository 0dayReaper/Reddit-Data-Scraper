The Solomon Islands and east Papua New Guinea are also quickly losing land mass at a rate that is going to threaten their cultures and island ecosystems\n\nWe are experiencing an extinction rate that is hundreds to thousands of times higher than the natural baseline extinction rate.\n\nI\u2019m not a \u201cdoomer\u201d and your toxic positivity doesn\u2019t make you a saint. This is a massive threat that needs to be taken seriously. Acting like we have all the time in the world is how we\u2019ve failed to solve this problem for nearly 100+ years. If we want to solve this, individual action isn\u2019t the way. We need to hold the companies that have known about this for decades accountable. We need to act collectively and demand massive change. We need massive divestments.

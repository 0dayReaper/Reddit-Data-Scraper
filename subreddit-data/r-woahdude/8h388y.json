I'm assuming even harder here, but maybe that's cause for these types of guns reloading (w/ no bolt lock) took longer than just using the tracer trick and keeping a hot round in the chamber so you don't have to rack the (empty, slide-forward) weapon.

This is why it's crucial to always be aware of your target and what lay beyond. A good backstop is key for safety. So, no, there doesn't necessarily have to be something hard to deflect the  rounds but it's likely they have some sort of targets or objective they're aiming for.

It's attached to the outer casing of the projectile, usually made out of something soft like brass or copper. When you hear the term \"full metal jacket\" that is what they are referring too. When the bullets hit things this jacket gets separated from the core of the bullet (made of lead, steal, other various things) and can go flying. I suspect what we are seeing is the jacket fly off after hitting a hard object, this isn't too dangerous. It could be ricocheting bullets, and they would absolutely still be lethal, but I'd tend to think it is the jacket/tracer compound being deflected on impact.",

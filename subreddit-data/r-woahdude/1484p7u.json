AI creates it for them; it's literally just making a prompt and explaining what you want to be made and then the AI creates it for you. Since it is AI created it's not even 'from' anyone. You could download it, post it again with your name and that would be fine. No one can claim any rights because it is AI made and all AI art is actually copyright free and in the public domain. People who think they 'create' art using AI are truly on a different level. It's really not the same as creating art yourself.\n\nCan awesome things be made with AI and can AI create beautiful art: yes. Can a person say they are creating art because they tell a program what it has to make while doing nothing in the process and not 'create' anything themselves: no.",

If I would go to a painter and say paint a psychedelic painting, he/she creates it, I take it home and then say I created this, that makes 0 sense right? It's fundamentally the same with AI. With a painter the painting would be from the painter since he created it, with AI it's from AI. But since AI uses information from the internet/information that other people created and doesn't really belong to anyone it is copyright free and in the public domain. This might change, but the fact that you yourself have not created anything won't.\n\nTo relate it to when camera's came about: It would be the equivalent of telling someone to take a picture of the sky, someone takes a picture of the sky, gives it to you and then you say you made the picture. It's not the same as actually taking the picture. The rights of the picture would belong to the photographer, the rights of AI created art belong to no one. But the principle of you not having created anything remains the same.",

Give direction. Decide how they want the art form to be composed, then sift through the takes and scenes etc and decide which ones convey the correct emotions, ideas, flow etc. Just because an artist hasn't used their own penstrokes, camera clicks, or even body at all doesn't mean they haven't made art. And attaching it to rights is silly. Is picasso not an artist because he died so long ago his copyright expired (or he sold the painting)? Actors, directors, choreographers, painters not artists because a production company owns the rights? Seems to me your thinking is a bit one dimensional, and if you don't appreciate an art form you should probably just find one you do and enjoy that.",

I'm saying you are not creating anything if you just tell someone/something what to create. You really think this is simular to directing a movie? I would love to see you try that in comparison to writing a prompt for AI. The director actually creates a style, he is actively creating and directing a movie and putting his/her stamp on it. Just saying 'I want a psychedelic trip with neon colors' is a long way from directing a movie. If Quentin Tarantino directs a movie, you can see that it is a Quentin Tarantino movie, it's very different from just telling people what to do.\n\nOfcourse copyright plays a role. Why do you think when someone makes something with AI it's not theirs?\n\nEdit: you think you can just make a Picasso painting and say it's yours or copy a picasso painting and sell it? And when a production company owns the rights, they buy the rights from the creator + ofcourse those works are not copyright free. It's not about who owns the rights, but about it being copyright free or not. People really do not understand what I am saying. Where do I say if you don't have the rights to a work youre not an artist lol? I'm saying you are not an artist or creator if you just write a prompt for AI. The AI is the creator here, not you.",

First of all, you're not reacting to anything I have to say and try to make it personal with some arguments that have nothing to do with the subject. Second, where do I say I'm done with AI art? I use AI myself, but I am just done with this particular AI art on r/woahdude and mostly with people who think they have created art themselves using AI.  Ironically; posting art online or making it public makes it subject to criticism and that's actually an important part of creating art, so I'm not really out of line here.\n\nI would genuinely would like to explain why AI art isn't actually 'from' anyone and why it is copywrite free (which it is). That's why I'm commenting. I actually think it's a really interesting subject.",

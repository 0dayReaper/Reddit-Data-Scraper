I prefer Clay Magic (blue, red only in extreme situations) over the others as it holds together better and I can get more uses. That is not to say that there is anything at all wrong with the Megs clay. Although I do not care for their lube for the clay.\n\nA lot of people shit on Megs as they are off the shelf, which a lot of their stuff can be crap, but they have some excellent products, and sadly over the last few years have had to reformulate or stop making a few things because of the environmental assholes in Cali. \n\nYou also have to remember what claying is, its pulling out dirt, grime, and imbedded environmental fallout from your vehicle's surface before your compound and polish it. Think of it as a way to exfoliate your car like you would when you exfoliate your face. You want all the dead skin off your face and the other grime on it so you can put lotion on your face and you won't clog your pores up.  A clay bar is just going to pull all that shit out so when you get to a rotary or DA you do not further grind it into the clearcoat. Then when you polish the surface is perfect to accept your LSP.\n\n",

You can reduce the chances however in the critical spots such as front bumper and first foot of the hood by installing clear bra. I've had one on every vehicle of mine since 1998 and would never not have one. They are barely noticeable and work very, very well.\n\n\nWaxes and sealants are there to protect the paint from the environment in which the car lives, UV, pollution from the sky, anything that can imbed itself in your paint at the small level. Things even like rail dust. Also to make the paint sexy. ",

It honestly sucks that you're insulting people for using the temporary waxes because they're actually great and should be used inbetween washes for protecting your actual wax job, even if you're a \"superior enthusiast\" and can afford a polishing setup.

A couple big names that are online that come to my mind that are good starter brands are chemical guys and 3D. \n\nTypically, a simple polish will consist of two compounds. A cutting compound that you use first to remove visible imperfections (note: deep scratches and other imperfections may not come out with just this method) and then a polishing compound to give it that shine. However, it does get a little more complicated  when you get to the actual application method.\n\nAll of this can be done by hand with a clean microfiber cloth but if you want to do a whole car you will want a tool. If you look at the bottom right of the picture there is a tool on the ground used to apply polish. There are two types rotary and random orbital polisher. Typically a rotary is used in conjunction with a cutting compound and is used to get the big scratches out. These are not for beginners, you can and probably will ruin your paint if you do not know what you are doing. It can \u201cburn\u201d your paint very easily, especially on edges, basically instead of taking off a small layer of clear coat you remove the entire layer of clear coat and after that it cannot be repair without a respray. For simplicity i will only cover the random orbital which usually when people say polisher they are referring to this type of tool. This one is much more forgiving and a newbie can use it with relative ease. They can cost a hundred dollars to a few hundred dollars, just depending on size and brand. It usually comes with a round velcro attachment that you can put different pads on. Just like the compound, a simple polish will call for a wool and foam pads. Wool is for cutting. Foam is for polishing. There are multiple different foam pads but typically you only need a standard foam pad. The process simplified is:\n\n1. Make sure car is clean\n2. Apply cutting compound to wool pad\n3. Use the wool pad to apply the compound onto the part of car you want to polish. Turn on the polisher slowly\n4. Increase speed and polish until you need to add more compound or the piece is polished\n5. Do this body panel by body panel focusing on small sections\n6. Repeat all of the above with the polishing compound and foam pad\n\nIf your car is black like in the above picture then you will want a special third pad for dark color cars and may want to considered a special compound for dark color cars. After cutting and  polishing this is when the wax/coating (this is a whole other topic in its self) comes into play.\n\nAs you can see it can get complicated and expensive. There is a reason why detailers charge (and get paid) so much money. I am by no means a professional and may have messed up the terminology. I also don\u2019t have any idea why I spent all this time typing this out but hopefully that helps someone out a little. It sounds complicated but is actually pretty easy to pick up and is very fulfilling when you are completed, it makes a world of a difference even if you aren\u2019t good at it.",

This needs to be sanded down or flattened with sanding paper, from roughly 1500 grit up 3000 grit, then the remaining haze from that is polished using a compound, which is then refined using a finishing polish. It\u2019s not an exact science as to how many steps or what levels of abrasive is required, but that\u2019s the general rule of thumb.",

Most waxes actually don't increase shine all that much as wax is meant as a protection layer against the sun and other oxidizers like salt.  It's compound and polish that actually corrects the paint and makes it more reflective and shiny and rich in color.   If you have a car with a lot of scratches or bad clear coat, no amount of wax will make it look this good.  \n\nOne of those two bottles in the background is almost certainly rubbing compound and the other is likely a polish.  Most waxes don't need to be applied with a high speed buffer.\n\nSource: 5 years professional detailing experience.  ",

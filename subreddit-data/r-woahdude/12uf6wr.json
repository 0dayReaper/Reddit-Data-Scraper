The point of the piece seems to be to highlight the negative space where a billboard would be, asking what is sacrificed when that view is sold to plaster an image of a hamburger or car there. \n\nI personally believe we\u2019d be better off with heavy restrictions to marketing and I\u2019m reading that into it, but I think it\u2019s more provocative in places with billboards.",

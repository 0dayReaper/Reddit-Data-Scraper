As the wind hits the windward side of the mountain, it becomes higher pressure, then as it crosses the top, that pressure drops as the landscape opens up below it. That pressure differential contributes to the condensation forming and dissipating as the air moves through. \n\nAn more down-to-earth example is when you open a bottle of champagne. The sudden pressure differential causes the he air to condense, showing up as vapor.",

The downwind side is doing just the opposite, rushing downward into relatively warm and compressed air. \n\nThe airmass, when waves like these are occurring, is constructed of layers of air that are slightly different temperatures that do not want to mix, so we call the air on these kinds of days laminar. Each layer can form its own lenticular cloud; hence the \"stack of pancakes\" look that you sometimes see. In this cloud you can easily see the layers, but they are just close together.",

Night time, walking alone through a dark barn, something creeping up behind you... I feel like the rest of the movie couldn't outdo that atmosphere. If anything, it kind of switched from horror to western/thriller after that, and I wanted more horror. It's like if the scariest scene in Psycho was the shower scene, but the shower scene turned out to be some dude clowning around with a fake knife, and then it never got more suspenseful after that. \n\n\nThe monkey scenes were close, but maybe because they were flashbacks, they just didn't hit as hard for me\n\n\nStill a fantastic movie, just not as suspenseful as I wished it was.",

It makes me wonder if Peele didn't know how horror-ish that barn scene would come across, because it kind of took the wind out of the sails (heh) for me for the rest of the movie. I felt like I was supposed to be more scared, feeling more suspense. \n\n\nInstead, it really reminded me a lot of Tremors (moreso than Jaws, for example), and I LOVED tremors, so I wasn't disappointed.

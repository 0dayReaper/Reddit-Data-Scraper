I do like flowers and being in nature so probably it helped. \nBut more important to me is people\u2019s opinions because I make paintings for people not for myself. If people like my art, it inspires me to keep working on paintings.",

I\u2019m sure you will be successful with your style, this will appeal to a wide audience. Also, I really enjoy the colors you\u2019ve used. From a distance it seems to shimmer, but as I zoomed in I was amazed at all the layers of colors. Well done.",

I find that oil pastels are more controllable for me when I do blur effects.  But it\u2019s just a suggestion, everyone paints differently.\n\nI like to go heavy with pastels then scratch/swipe them off with the flat edge of a credit card, then go back into it again with more pastel layers in some places.  Then add on that with oil paint.  Its also fun to mix watercolors on top of oil pastels for funky water bead effects.",

He\u2019s the OG godfather of fingertapping, and he\u2019s the entire reason I learned how to play that style. Prepare to be amazed. \n\nI\u2019d personally recommend his versions of Somewhere Over the Rainbow and Eleanor Rigby. The recordings are good, but make sure you watch the live videos because you will really see how impressive it is. He plays the guitar like a piano and it\u2019ll blow your mind.",

Sounds like shit, really. You have to finger the strings to create more pleasing chord shapes.\n\nHowever, you can change the tuning of certain strings so that they play a pleasing chord, like D Major:\n\nDADF#AD\n\nNow, if you hit the strings \"open,\" it plays a nice-sounding D Major chord. This allows you to slap the strings and have them ring out a D Major chord while you tap and drum and slap etc around the neck. Songs like OP probably wouldn't be possible in standard guitar tuning. \n\nBut, it's got a very characteristic sound, and a lot of people who do this style tend to lean heavily on that Open-D chord, which makes the music sound very samey.\n\n---\n\n**Tl;DR** - Most guitarists who play in this style tune their guitars a special way to make it easier. However, reliance on that style of tuning makes a lot of these guitarists sound the same.",

Lots of people who play like that only/mostly do covers and in doing so butcher them to fit in more tricks.\n* Got vocals as performed by the player! Yeah, this guy likes to make music more than just be talented at playing it.\n\nThis style of playing typically is how skilled musicians will show off to each other or make jokes with each other during practice or recording. Someone will say something like \"look I'm Les Claypool\" and start slapping on a chello or something kind of nonsensical. It's not typically something you do for a crowd as it's only crowd-pleasing for a short time.

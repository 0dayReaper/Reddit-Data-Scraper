I was commissioned to build some fish tank lamps a few years ago and used 10\" diameter acrylic tubes to make them.  The acrylic tube came in a five foot length and cost over $120.  There's no way to be sure what material the cylinder in the gif is made of just by viewing, but it's gotta be the most expensive piece of the build.  \n\nBtw, I used acrylic as it provides the greatest optical clarity for the fish tank lamps.  I built the lamps to have both a standard lamp type function, with light emitting up and out, as well as fish tank type lighting that just went down into the tank.  The curve of the cylinder made the fish appear larger than they were, which was pretty cool.  I also plumbed an airline in through the base for a small air stone for bubbles to come out of the rocks at the bottom of the tank.   \n\nIt was a really neat project that I immensely enjoyed, and I plan on making two for myself with the excess materials.  Of course, that's just another personal wishlist project on a long list of things I want to make for my own use.  ",

Now you might say, \"well, why not just plumb it in the largest size clear PVC elbow they could find?\"  Which is a good question.  There is probably more to consider about this type of project than you may initially think.  To have a whirlpool effect that goes the full height of the clear cylinder, you'd have to calculate the proper volume of water, and also provide that volume of water at a specific velocity.  It's possible that you could get the proper water volume in a smaller size, but it would be a lt a greater flow velocity.  If the fountain was built using smaller pipes and pumping the same volume of water, the whirlpool effect would cause there to be larger circular area in the bottom of the cone.  \n\nHope that all makes sense.  If not, let me know and I may be able to describe this all a little better.",

In my explanation above, I didn't even consider that as an option as I was thinking solely on the design used.

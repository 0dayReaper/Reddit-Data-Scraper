The medium setting changes once a minute but does a little routine like this. We have ours on the elaborate setting and it changes twice a minute. Shorter than this one but still, it can be annoying. We keep it that way because it\u2019s what my husband wants. \n\n-you can also set it for a 24 hour display as well\n\n-they\u2019re expensive as hell but available for purchase online https://clockclock.com/ We have the black 24 piece one.",

Description:

The best links to click while you're stoned!

Psychedelic, mindfucking, mesmerizing, reality-distorting or trippy games, video, audio &amp; images that make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder!

Come for mindfucks and self-inflicted gaslighting. Or the hypnotic or mesmerising. Vivid colors, intense patterns. Mind-blowing science and philosophy. Chill or trippy music. Surrealism, absurdism and strangeness.

Reminder: This is not a "reaction subreddit".

Rules:

WOAHDUDE MATERIAL ONLY: ALLOWED: Trippy or mesmerizing content that meets our listed WoahDude criteria. This is not a mere "reaction subreddit". Don't post content just because it makes you literally say the words 'woah dude'. 

NOT ALLOWED: Rare talents, stunts, extreme human abilities, 1-in-a-million shots, sports highlights. Things that are merely cool, amazing or unusual, but not in any psychedelic way.

No TOXIC BEHAVIOR: Toxic behavior of any kind is not allowed. This includes (but is not limited to) trolling, vote brigading, comment brigading, drama brigading, baiting, harassing, taunting, insulting, spoiling, being antagonistic or needlessly bothering users or mods. This also includes making snide, condescending remarks such as "im14andthisisdeep" or "iamverysmart".

LINK FLAIR required: You must select the correct link flair. Adding flair after a removal will NOT get your post approved. 

([more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_3_-_link_flair_required))

DESCRIPTIVE TITLES required: Your post must use a descriptive title. Titles must describe the content, not your feelings or reactions to the content. "woah" or "this is trippy" is not a proper description.

Use WARNING TAGS: If a post or comment contains content that can trigger bad vibes or epilepsy, you must manually type **[bad vibes]** or **[epilepsy]** in the title of the post, or before the content if in a comment.

**NSFW** content and **SPOILERS** must be tagged as well. Our definitions of each may be more strict than yours, so err on the side of caution.

**NSFL content is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**

No product advertising: Do not post or request links to product info pages or store fronts (directly or indirectly) or provide, request, or express desire for any information that can facilitate the acquisition of such information. 

If you want to advertise, [do it through the proper channel here](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising).

Avoid REPOSTS: Reposts should generally be avoided. They are sometimes permitted, such as if the last submission was very long ago, and had very few votes.

([more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_7_-_repost_policy))

No LOW-EFFORT posts: Only post content if it actually belongs according to both the letter and spirit of our rules. You may be banned if it appears you are posting content for no other reason than to gain karma, self promote, or pad your account history. 

Avoid posting: Quasi-reposts, Low quality files, Uninteresting content.

No back-seat modding: If you spot content that you think violates any rule, use the report button or modmail us. Do not air your grievances in the comment section. Again -- contact the actual mods.

More often than not, users who back-seat mod don't even understand our rules to begin with themselves, and are only misleading people about what our rules actually are.

Use DIRECT LINKS: When submitting images, link **directly to the image file** and not any page that contains extra nonsense like ads, related images/thumbnails, or comment threads. 

When submitting videos, link directly to the hosting website (i.e. youtube, vimeo) and not a video embedded on some random blog or sites like ebaumsworld.

Do not use URL shorteners, redirects, or link to rehosted content or blogspam.

XPOST labels are banned: Crossposts (also known as XPOSTS) are fine, just don't label them as such.

Also, do not submit links to other subreddit posts or thread. Instead, you must create a brand new post here, or use Reddit's built-in crosspost function. 

([more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_11_-_xpost_labels_are_banned))

Freebooting is banned: Avoid posting content that is watermarked or rehosted by a party other than the author without their permission for personal or monetary gain.

I wonder if you focused on a specific theme or narrative, if it would make these sort of pieces even stronger. Like the section with the eyes could really express a feeling of being watched or paranoia or something. Piecing the abstract imagery/animations together with the messy transitions inherit in the process could portray some really interesting things. Jason Galea's work with King Gizzard might be an inspiration although his video work tends to be more digital. Anyways, just some thoughts. Keep pushing! Love it.",

I remember one day in marching band, we were getting ready for a parade and were going over out motions.   \nWe adopted the strategy of a local university for dealing with turns, which is basically rush through it and reform as quickly as possible. So, I'm on the very end of my line so I'm jogging to get back into position while playing, only to have the trombone behind me knock me in the back of the head, pushing me forward into the guy in front of me. Trumpet hit is back, mouthpiece jammed into my braces... had to get pulled out of the parade because I was bleeding everywhere",

On a good day some other dudes catching their bait with sabiki rigs will throw some beer or weed to share the 100 pilchards we get with a single throw. Nice deal, I'd say. \n\nThen there was the one dummy who says \"WOOO BARRACUDA!!\" and throws the cast net on it.. Shredded the thing to pieces. Darn fool. ",

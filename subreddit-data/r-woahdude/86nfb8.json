I never played an Elderscrolls/Bethesda game before, I just knew it was popular. I ended up playing Farcry 3 most of January before trying it. The disc was scratched as fuck and wouldn't read and gamestop wouldn't take it back because they \"wouldn't sell a scratched up game in the first place.\" I kinda forgot about. Now, after playing Fallout 4 Xbox and buying all the other Fallouts on Steam, I'm thinking I need to give Skyrim another shot.",

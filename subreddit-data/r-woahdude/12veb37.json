Theres actually some weed I bought for 40 that was really solid but they like didn't trim it, so it was probably more like 22 grams and I had to put in some labor. A lot of time you can find great tasting and smelling weed for super cheap but it's got low THC %. To get high THC, good smell, good taste, good bag appeal, it's usually 60+. If you want hand trim and boutique grown with really good drying and curing practices, you can get that for like 130-175. The problem with the cheaper stuff is it's like a rock, so fucking dry and dense it breaks up into powder in the grinder. I started growing my own and man you just can't beat that for any price.",

I never imagined in my wildest dreams that 420 would be legally and openly celebrated in Detroit. Seeing it, and the total lack of judgement kind of makes me feel a bit emotional. \n\n\nThe war on drugs was a slow motion genocide. \ufffcSo many lives were destroyed in the past for what ultimately amounts to nothing. There's literally nothing to show for it but an enormous increase in social instability and human suffering, and also an incalculable loss of human potential. It makes you wonder, if people had gone down a different time line where it didn't happen how much better America and the world would be. \n\nI hope 420 also could also be a day of remembrance for all the innocent people who had their lives ruined and their families destroyed by the insanity of the war on drugs. \n\n\nNot to get political, but it seems like America\u2019s society for doing evil are turning their eye of Sauron from trying to harm blacks over to harming trans and gay people. People gotta fight back. We can\u2019t let them get away with it. \ufffc",

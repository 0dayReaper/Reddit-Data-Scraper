Blender Guru just did a whole thing on NFTs and he raised some worthwhile points. Like; \"Is a print of an artwork worth more than the original for any good reason?\" and \"If no one will buy digital art, is there any reason to elevate the artwork beyond what would get you hired at a studio?\"\n\nTo quote Oscar Wilde: \n\n*\"All art is quite useless.\"*\n\nWe don't *need* art, it doesn't provide anything other than a feeling. But just because we don't need it, doesn't mean we don't crave to own it and treasure it. While I'll probably just download a picture I like, I do hope this NFT phenomenon helps push digital art into a more creative sphere and allow artist a chance to do more than draw furries to make ends meet.\n\nThat was probably a bit much in the form of a response to your short comment... I guess I was just feeling chatty.",

Every NFT minted is just another opportunity for people to try and flip something for a profit. But unlike standard fungible cryptos that millions of people are all propping up with their demand, individual NFTs will very quickly become worthless if they're not world famous pieces of art or other media. Even then nobody cares if you own the NFT associated with a digital image because you don't have possession or copyrights over the image. \n\nThe only real use for NFTs is to launder money, and the art world has enough of a problem with that already without introducing completely anonymous untraceable transactions. \n\nBut hey,  far be it from me to stop a fool and his money parting.",

Keeping up with scarcity seems almost pointless, too--owning an NFT on artwork you've spent a lot of money on sounds like an absolute chore if you're interested in it being an appreciating asset (which, if I'm being honest, I don't see that happening, but idk I don't study this shit and I barely know anything about it).",

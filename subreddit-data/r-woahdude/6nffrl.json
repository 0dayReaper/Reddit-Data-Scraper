Gonna get banned for brigading either way so keep it chill. Or don't, banning is fun too.\n\nEDIT: Best part is the T_D users demanding proof of the racism, trying to start a goofy conspiracy theory here that this is a lie... like they *actually* find it hard to believe that their group is swamped with vocal racists. **Worst. Conspiracy theory. Ever.** Also, you trolls are banned too just for being that goofy. ",

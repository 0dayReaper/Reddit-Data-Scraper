If one equation satisfies the wave equation (that means it describes a wave) adding any number of other equations which satisfy the wave equation, their sum will also satisfy the wave equation. Mathematically, when adding equations, they are completely independent from another. \nThe real world is a bit messier and the molecules that make up water can interact with one another (colloquially 'collide'), this causes turbulence and the whitewater between the two waves. \nBut the (ideal) wave equation still describes these real water waves quite well, as the height of the waves changes before and after passing through each other is barely noticeable, so the turbulence only carries a small amount of energy away from the waves. That is because molecules are tiny and don't directly collide with one another that often.",

So, the water in the wave is only moving up and down, and the wave itself (the energy) is moving forward. When they collide, they just add (or subtract) with each other. The water will be in more or less the same position after the wave passes as it was before\n\n\n[Here\u2019s a good picture that illustrates this](https://isaacphysics.org/images/content/concepts/physics/figures/concepts_Superposition_interfering_waves_graphs_2.svg)",

They move up, move side to side, then move back down to about where they started.  So no, they don't push through each other, but instead the two waves happen to be lifting and moving side to side the same spot at the same time, which just becomes the combination of those two waves.",

This happens in any waveform, be it light, sound, fluid dynamics (including air, hence why it applies to sound), etc. Waves need to hit each other 180 degrees out of phase and with identical amplitudes to cancel each other out, otherwise they do what these ones did and interact, becoming weaker along each wavefront but magnifying in intensity where they interact",

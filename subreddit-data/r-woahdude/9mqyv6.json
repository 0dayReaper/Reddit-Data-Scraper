[Here's a hang glider pilot who chimed in who caught a few of my mistakes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/9mqyv6/absolutely_beautiful_but_terrifying/e7hlvir/)\n\nOnce you start moving that wing starts taking your weight off of your feet. I've sprinted down snow covered hills at 6ish miles per hour and while normally I would have busted my face on the hill, the paraglider above my head kept me stable. Not saying it's foolproof, just that it's easier than it looks once you're past the first few steps.\n\nEven if he tripped halfway through that run the wing would have enough lift for him to stabilize himself so rather than falling on his face he would just stumble, catch himself, and keep running.\n\nEdit: worth mentioning that there are a million things that can go wrong and you need to get professional training before doing anything like this, but once you understand the risks and make smart decisions (like doing it when you can see your landing area...) it's incredibly liberating and stress-free.

Instructors are trained to teach you the most important information first, and avoid overloading you with unnecessary information. What might be good advice from one pilot to another can be terrible advice when given to a student or a beginner. Get good instructors (preferably ones that don't use the term SUPER to describe their training), and everything else will follow in time.",

That flight might not even get down to the clouds if the pilot finds lift in a thermal, or mechanical lift from the air moving up the mountain side or even wave lift caused by the surrounding geography and air currents. My guess is that when the pilot got down to the cloud layer visibility between the clouds made it possible to see the earth below.",

If there is a cloud layer, the amount of time it takes for you to glide down probably won't be enough for you to have any \"faith\" that they will part (especially when they are as dense as they are in the clip. You'd have to know the landscape REALLY well since you will be getting turned around quite a bit. Even then what's to say a miscalculation doesn't throw you into the side of a cliff within the clouds.? Yeah this is super pretty, but a whole lot of nope.",

Anyway, one time we were coming up to the top and we heard a loud flapping pop.  We looked up and some dude was gliding off the side of the mountain in a yellow and orange hang glider.  It really was spectacular.  We promised each other that before we die, we will do that.  But then I got older and realized there is no way that I am ever doing it.  Which sucks because it looks pretty amazing.  ",

The blades were essentially the size of 747 wings. It was supposed to power the entire town of Boone, but it never worked. It would be turned on in rare events for testing, but it usually wasn\u2019t spinning or in operation. Boone is known for its combination of hippie + college + mountain town vibe. There was a small cult following of the turbine called \u201cThe Whirlies\u201d, named because of the whirling and whistling noises the turbine made when the high winds of Howard\u2019s Knob whipped through the support cables and truss.\n\nhttps://www.ncpedia.org/worlds-largest-windmill-boone",

Even went up in a towed glider before (which was amazing honestly).\n\nI had a dream when I was like 15 years old that I was hang gliding and I encountered MYSELF and I told myself in the dream \"Do not go hang gliding, you will die.  You will die in real life.  This is a warning.\"  And sure as shit, since then, I have had a handful of opportunities to go hang gliding and have never once gone because my dream was too damn real, and it literally burned into my brain after I had it.",

You take off like a commercial flight and they detach you at height for the glide down. It's not nearly as intense. It's really enjoyable.\n\nYou have to really do this to understand, but those gliders are really big and stable. My instructor gave us a nice thrill where we picked up a ton of speed and did a flyby on my friends close to landing, but I would say if you can handle even a small rollercoaster, you can do this.\n\nI've skydived a bunch, so my perspective is skewed some. Obviously the fear of heights would be the big hurdle for anyone. ",

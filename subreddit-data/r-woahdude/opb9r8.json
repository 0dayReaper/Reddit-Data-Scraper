You'd be unable to do that with liquid n2 so you'd need significantly more of it. that and it's in a larger space so would be more difficult to keep cool. You'd likely want better insulation for your electronicals too. \n\nIt's a fun hypothetical though for sure. My personal ideal would just be the inverse of those boiling water dispenser taps you see where the tank is under the counter. Just squirt some n2 into your pot and swirl it around, then down the drain or into your specialized disposal container if that's needed (no idea).",

The dry ice doesn't scratch/remove the surface like media blasters, it works best removing foreign materials and loose burrs. As my understanding goes, dry ice blasting relies on the temperature difference to shift the material around and uses the air stream to carry it away. Standard media blasting like glass bead and baking soda is much more removing material with a thousand cuts.",

The movement is called the Leidenfrost Effect, basically the LN2 is boiling so quickly a vapor layer gets trapped between the liquid drops and the bottom of the pan. Since LN2 has a low surface tension, we see these cool patterns as momentum and the vapor escaping are more governing for its fluid behavior.\n\nThe dirt gets picked up because its loose and the vapor barrier from the boiling LN2 acts almost like a compressed air line, its a small amount of pressurized gas being blown at a very small area. That is enough to lift the dirt up, and the LN2 is enough of a solvent that the dirt mixes in rather than bouncing off. Its not really dissolving the dirt any more than a stew is a solvent for potatoes, its still large particles floating around but move it aggressively enough and it can be suspended in the fluid.",

It works remarkably well, and I don't think metal contraction is the main reason, though I don't know for sure. \n\nWhen pouring liquid nitrogen onto a room-temp metal surface, mechanically essentially the same thing is happening. The nitrogen is boiling on contact.",

If the particles are not wet by by the liquid they will remain unmoved or try to minimize contact (this is like putting hot chocolate mix or cocoa powder on top of milk, it creates a tiny mountain on top of the milk until it gets too heavy and sinks to the bottom)  \n\n\nSo in this video, the carbon dirt is \"wet\" by the liquid nitrogen\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeidenfrost effect: Some other person mentioned this but I'll expand the Leidenfrost effect happens when a liquid is supported by a cloud of it's own gas. you may have seen this if you've ever splashed water on a very hot pan where the water beads up and rolls around like it has no friction. Liquid nitrogen does this because room temperature ( 20 Celsius ) is much hotter than the boiling point of nitrogen ( - 200 Celsius ) so the nitrogen in contact with the container boils and supports the liquid nitrogen on a cloud of it's own gas. which is why it also looks like it moves without friction.  \n\n\nwhen the \" black web\" looking thing forms in the video it's just because liquid nitrogen droplets can combine/separate easily (like a drop of water falling into more water you can't distinguish it because they are the same)  \n\n\nso to reiterate: The dirt particles are suspended in the liquid nitrogen which then bounces around because of the Leidenfrost effect.",

                    "comment": "Physicist here: first a disclaimer. I got a degree but am not a magical always right authority.\n\nPeople generally have good intuition about these things and are on the right track but I think there are a few misconceptions. \n\n1. Leidenfrost effect. Yes a little. This probably why the dirt floats around so smoothly, it's being carried by the nitrogen which is skating around the pot. Not a big contributor to the actual dirt removal though.\n\n2. Boiling. Yes the nitrogen is boiling, but I don't think that it's the primary cause, or greatest contributor, particularly because the internal kinetic energy of the nitrogen is probably quite low compared to, say, the ambient air, which, if you think about it, is MUCH MUCH hotter boiling nitrogen steam bouncing around much faster. (Air ~ 70% nitrogen)\n\nMy two cents: the nitrogen is very very cold and we can imagine it like an energy hole. It's gonna suck in a bunch of heat from its surroundings.  The pot and dirt in this case are big energy sources draining into that energy hole. Previously they were at thermal equilibrium, their respective particles jiggling around happily against similarly temp'ed air, but suddenly the \"air\" around them got waaaaaaay lower in energy, so by comparison the somewhat mundane thermal jiggling of the pot molecules and dirt molecules got WAY higher by comparison.\n\nMy guess is the dirt came off sort of like how a toy spring snake pops out of a can. It's less to do with the snake being pulled out than it is the snake being propelled by the imbalance created by the removal of the lid. The air was essentially \"holding it on\" due to its relatively high thermal energy and the nitrogen is essentially using the dirt and pot's own thermal energy to \"suck\" the dirt off the surface.\n\nFurthermore: large changes in temperature usually cause thermal expansion or contraction. Dirt is not immune to this, and going through rapid shrinkage (very subtle size change) could also loosen it from the surface, like a bandaid on a flexing knee.\n\nI could be way off, of course! Just guessing.",

My old school used to be just outside an industrial zone, and my chemistry teacher would get a lot of liquid nitrogen to use in demonstrations from one of the plants. Something she did was have us all stand on our chairs and she poured the liquid nitrogen in the centre of the room and we watched all the dust get carried off to the edges of the room. Then she had us sweep it up after it all boiled away, so I'm pretty sure it was just a way to get us to clean for her.",

We didn't have a huge budget for things, but we did have access to a ton of liquid nitrogen that we used for a cryo pump. We would occasionally use the excess liquid nitrogen from our dewer and pour it on the floor to get the dirt to do this, moving it along in one direction before sweeping it up. Looking back, not the smartest move but it passed the time.",

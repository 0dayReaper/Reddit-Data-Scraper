But whereas we might be able to recreate the visuals, the \"body buzz and mental disorientation\" are a seperate matter entirely. We'd somehow have to influence the brain without introducing chemicals to it. Maybe with some sort of neural interfacing this could be done, but that's very far off.\n\nIt sure is interesting to imagine that people might be hooked up to \"digital\" drugs. Imagine being delivered a custom-made digital package that you could run via your brainlink that would give you the same hit every time.\n\nNo more \"chasing that first high\" (possibly? if this package would stimulate the brain in the exact same way every time with no diminishing returns), no more having to spend insame amounts of money on new stash (you could theoretically just run the same executable every time, once you've purchased it), and no physical side effects from introducing harmful chemicals to our bodies. No more risk of overdosing in a toxicological sense (although one could argue that there could be malignant parties who write software that would be harmful or destructive to the brain). Although in a society where the technology for neural-interfacing might exist, it'd be relatively easy to check on the specific contents of an executable.\n\nNot sure what it'd do for addiction - there would be no chemical addiction but we've long established that we have the tendency to become addicted to things other than just chemicals, so we might still see that problem arise. But in that same sense I'd imagine there would be software-suites tailor made to slowly nurse the brain off of its addiction and steadily bring it back to its regular state.",

It's a regular video of a cat walking across the scene but the pixels near the top are in the future, and the pixels go further back in time the lower down you go. This means you see the part of the cat's legs that were in the past.\n\nI'm convinced the map used to determine the time delay is pretty complicated since the cat's tail trails off behind them as well.",

In the cookies one, the input video was the cookies rising, then i reversed it so they fell again to make it a ping pong-ed loop where it goes back and forth. Then I applied some time warping so the cookies rise and fall at different times.",

Ayahuasca basically keeps your body from immediately metabolizing the DMT like in what happens when you smoke it. When I smoked it, the entity was only there, but was very ominous and short lived. When taken for hours that same entity showed me a deeply religious experience that changed my life. The long form DMT is way more powerful.",

I smoked some weed on it after talking a 5 day break from THC and then started seeing hallucinations of the face of Norman Bates from Bates\u2019s Hotel. It wasn\u2019t the same as when you take shrooms and can kinda see the outlines of faces in a bathroom tile patterns or something like that, because I was literally hallucinating the face everywhere in my vision and had to take a Xanax to end the trip.\n\nSo I would say that vivid hallucinations can occur with psychedelics at higher doses and in this case I think I went into a temporary psychosis from smoking strong weed at the peak of a trip, guess ya could say the THC synergized  with it. I\u2019d say this is a rare experience and most of my others have been pleasurable with mostly just waves and fractal changes.",

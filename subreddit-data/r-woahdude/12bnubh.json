But when you argue that \"this doesn't relate\", you meant to say that this doesn't relate to *your* idea of what chemtrails are.\n\nWhen things like this are discussed, the side arguing against it usually argues against the most outlandish and fantastical version of the theory. Which is of course rarely if ever true. Nor is there one unified theory about this, so it's important to drop the assumptions when discussing the subject because we're not all on the same page and you start off talking next to each other right off the bat.\n\nYou say \"it\" isn't practical from high altitude, without knowing what *it* is, you merely make an assumption based on some internet waffle.

I already know wherever you are the sky is hazy because it happens everytime. Before 1990, we used to have blue skies, and planes didn't streak the sky's with garbage. Contrails would disappear behind the plane. Do some research, and I promise you would be surprised.",

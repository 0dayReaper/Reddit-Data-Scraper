It's that weird looking long toothed thing with the tentacle coming out of its forehead that's got a lightbulb on the end. Any time a cartoon character goes into deep water, this thing shows up to eat it.  \n\nWhen scientists started to study it, they'd catch one and dissect it and hey look, a female. Then they'd catch another one. Female again. Then again and again and again. All female, and a large number had parasites.  \n\nIt took a long time to figure out what was going on...  \n\nTurns out the male angler fish is much much smaller than the female, like 1/20 the size smaller. When he finds a suitable female, he bites her abdomin and holds on. Then he starts to \"melt\" into her. Eventually, their bodies fuse together, blood and the like flowing through her to him and back. In return, he fertilizes her.  \n\nMakes my skin crawl...",

Also, they have the ability to move the lights so that they aren\u2019t visible (when a predator gets too close). \n\nThey aren\u2019t organs that create the bioluminescence, but bacteria. The bacteria are fed off of what the fish eats. So, they actually start to dim if the fish stops eating and will go out completely if the fish doesn\u2019t eat for long enough. In the home aquarium, I believe a fish that has lost its bioluminescent bacteria will not regain it.",

If the wind is going at the correct speed, the plane would appear to be sitting absolutely static to a ground observer - or in this case the ground would appear static to a passenger observing. Some birds of prey use this to hover while looking for food without using as much energy as flying would (kestrels, some owls, some eagles etc). \n\nThis case is just a trick of videography though.

Provided the plane is traveling at the exact same speed as the wind and in exactly opposite directions, the plane would appear to be frozen in place relative to the ground.  This is basically the reason planes differentiate between ground speed and air speed.  It would have to be a pretty damn strong wind to do this to a jetliner though. ",

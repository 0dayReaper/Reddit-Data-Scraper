I could yell his name and he'd just keep on sleeping. He was a wonderful dog in every way, but his hearing simply vanished as he aged. But he was still a great dog. I was always able to get his attention with a gentle pet or a treat, and I just taught him hand signals so that he'd understand commands without needing to hear then. Because even if he couldn't hear you, he was still a sweet dog that loved cuddles and snacks, and was capable of learning new things (in exchange for a treat, of course).",

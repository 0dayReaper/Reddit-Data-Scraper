Please take note of a few things:\n\n- We are **NOT** a \"reaction subreddit\".\n\n- We are **NOT** a subreddit about content that is merely interesting or amazing. \n\n- We are **NOT** interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other general subreddits.\n\n- We are specifically made for **psychedelic content**, trippy or mesmerizing stuff that will make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder!\n\n[Here is the full explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_1_-_woahdude_material_only) of what belongs here. **You'll notice our definition of trippy is more expansive than the obvious fractals and tie-dye concept, but there's a lot we exclude as well.** If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Failure to accept these conditions is grounds for ban. \n\nIf you want examples that exemplify our purpose, check our [WOAHDUDE APPROVED](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/search?q=flair:woahdude&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=new) hall of fame.

They've been nicknamed \"sea lillies\" because of this flower-like appearance they used to have. Modern ones don't have the stalk though, so they appear more starfish-like (despite being as closely related to starfish as they are to sea cucumbers - all the same phylum, but phylum are fairly broad catagories). They're also monsterous demons and I hate them, but a lot of their stalk discs can be found in mudstones just outside the Colorado Plateau, if anyone happens to be up there - found a whole ton just sitting off the side of a highway while on a field study in eastern AZ yesterday\n\nApologies if some of this info is incorrect, I'm a geology major in a required paleo course, so I know a little bit but a lot of my knowledge is still incomplete. But this is crinoids as I understand them, and I can not possibly put more emphasis on how I understand them as terrible, terrible things. I just greatly dislike them and their appearance as human spines with feathers, thats just plain hellish",

They trap small food particles using a sticky mucus that feeds into the mouth.\nBecause feather stars do not have an official stomach, consumables cycle through their body in waves while still providing nutrition.\n\n\n",

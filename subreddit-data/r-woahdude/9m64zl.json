Please take note of a few things:\n\n- We are **NOT** a \"reaction subreddit\".\n\n- We are **NOT** a subreddit about content that is merely interesting or amazing. \n\n- We are **NOT** interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other general subreddits.\n\n- We are specifically made for **psychedelic content**, trippy or mesmerizing stuff that will make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder!\n\n[Here is the full explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_1_-_woahdude_material_only) of what belongs here. **You'll notice our definition of trippy is more expansive than the obvious fractals and tie-dye concept, but there's a lot we exclude as well.** If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Failure to accept these conditions is grounds for ban. \n\nIf you want examples that exemplify our purpose, check our [WOAHDUDE APPROVED](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/search?q=flair:woahdude&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=new) hall of fame.

But San Antonio often votes Democrat as well.  \n  \nJust from my own experience standing in the voting lines here, I'm seeing more and more young people voting. Texas will go purple soon, and eventually Democratic. Hell, Texas was a Democratic voting state until only very recently.",

And, so, gradually classical liberalism was de-emphasized and traditionalism, christianity, conservatism , and the republican party were woven together. The far right has done an amazing job at this. They were playing the long game and it worked. But I think that they over played their hand and the pendulum is going to swing hard in the other direction soon.",

With that flashlight?\" And I told him \"I\u2019m shining- I\u2019m shining in the window so I can teach your son about the universe\" He said \"get out of my yard and why are you communicating to my son? Why are you in all black? Behind my bushes shining a light into my house?\" And I said \"I\u2019m teaching your son about the universe! I\u2019m shining a light- shining a light right in there and exploring his room as he's looking out and exploring the universe!\" I turn the light off and I see your son go to bed and I turn the light back on and I do swirls on his wall like a comet's tail. I do this every night with your son.",

I sell reproductions that are a bit smaller. You can see all my work at [Suite3D.com](https://Suite3D.com).\n\nI notice a lot of discussion about the color of Mars. At the time this work was painted the best images of Mars were provided by the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft. The color images seemed to show greenish dark areas to me. But one of the comments was correct about the fact that green is a complement to red and that it enhances the color. And I'll confess to some wishful thinking at the time as well. \n\nThank you everyone for your interest in my work!",

Pluto was determined not a planet by the IAU, and these are the rules to be a planet determined by them.\n1: Must orbit around the sun.\n2: Must be large enough to be nearly spherical due to gravity.\n3: Must \"clear it's orbit\".\n\nThe third rule is the only reason that pluto is not a planet. Yeah, it blew my mind when I heard about it too. The only reason pluto is not a planet is because it's orbit slightly crosses over Neputune's. Since Neptune is significantly larger than Pluto, it is considered a planet while Pluto is not. I asked my Astronomy professor \"So size has almost nothing to do with being a planet?\", and he said \"Yes, if Pluto didn't have Neptune in it's orbit it would be considered a planet\". I couldn't believe it first, but he was totally right,",

The artist updated it in 2016 to reflect the new colors.\n\n[See both versions here.](http://suite3d.com/painting/planetarysuite.shtml#tableholder)\n\nHonestly the original looks much better. Notice the continuous arc of color from Neptune across Pluto, which is completely broken by the update. It doesn't fit the rest of the composition.",

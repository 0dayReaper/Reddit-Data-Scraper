Honestly doesn\u2019t surprise me a ton, but it\u2019s kind of funny that the best transition I may have ever seen was from an old skate video.\n\nThe video cuts right at the moment the skater \u201cjumps\u201d. The actual jumping you see is the second video after the cut while he is upside down on the ground. Then another cut happens as he starts to \u201cjump again\u201d and transitions into the finish of a real jump, maybe even the same one from the beginning, but I can\u2019t tell.",

                    "comment": "I was all set to smugly  tell you that jellyfish don't _have_ minds because, obviously, they don't have brains. But then I checked my assumption first and it turns out this is a surprisingly complicated subject and we don't actually _know_ if jellyfish have anything analogous to a human mind. Their nervous systems vary in complexity, and while none have a central \"brain\" structure like we're familiar with in vertebrates the nerve ring that runs around the edge of their mantle might serve at least some of the same functions and we frankly don't fully understand how it works. Box jellyfish are more sophisticated, they have complex eyes and use them to intentionally navigate and can even engage in primitive mating rituals. Is that enough to say a jellyfish has a mind? I'm not sufficiently versed in the subject to answer but I at least feel like at this point it's not as straightforward as I'd assumed.\n\nBut of course being able to communicate is a whole other thing and even if they are capable of some form of thought that doesn't mean that they're able to communicate it to others, or even understand a concept of others in the first place.",

The eggs create polyps (think like an individual bit of coral, or a sea anemone). The polyps develop something like a stack of upside down proto-jellyfish, which then break off into independent organisms and develop into the jellyfish people normally think of.\n\nIt's like if bird eggs didn't hatch into birds, and instead hatched into weird tree-like animals that grew birds as fruit which then fell off and became separate animals.\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Schleiden-meduse-2.jpg/600px-Schleiden-meduse-2.jpg",

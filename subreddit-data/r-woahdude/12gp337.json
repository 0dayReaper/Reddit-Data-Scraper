            "comment": "What you are seeing here is the full panorama of 400 drone photographs combined to create a singular large view panorama. This view would only be possible by a plane, but with this new technique I am experimenting with allows me to get this view while keeping to drone laws and regulations.\n\nThis is part of an ongoing project called \"Megascapes\" where I am photographing popular Cornish towns and locations in high resolution. Each photo consists of around 600 individual drone photographed combined into one ultra high resolution panorama. This is of the main stretch in St Ives. There is a lot in this photograph so it's hard to pick out details, I've included some of the main attractions.\n\n  \n1. Porthgwidden Beach  \n2. St Ives Head  \n3. St Ives Harbour  \n4.

The drone does lots of low passes making a grid pattern, taking photos along the way, until it has completed the grid pattern of the desired area. I then merge these photos together to essentially make a large panorama, the same way your phone would do if you selected the panorama mode.",

Each section of the compound eye isn't re-creating the same field of vision, it's adding a \"pixel\" to a single field of vision.\n\nA fly's vision is very low resolution, but is adapted to very quickly proces movement, which is why it's so hard to swat a fly before they *fly* away.",

Idk how to describe the exact angle above the fly, but it\u2019s definitely there! \n\nIf there\u2019s a fly in your room you can use trial and error to figure it out!",

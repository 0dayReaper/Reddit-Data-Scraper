You don't sound like you're a part of that movement.\n\nI also think alt-right became a bit of a dumb buzzword that people used to address anybody with fringe views they disagreed with, but I understand there actually is a sizeable political movement of people who are downright bigoted &amp; backwards. So it's a mixed bag I guess.\n\nBut in this context (pepe the frog being used as a nazi mascot) it's pretty clearly in the realm of stereotypical alt-right kinda shit. I think the label fits in this case.\n\nNot that I think of pepe in that way. The whole reason for channers to use him that way was a troll attempt in getting people to start thinking of him as a hate symbol, and it worked. By recognizing pepe as a hate symbol people are essentially saying \"yes good job trolls, we accept your decree\".",

Some people just don't realise that a lot of what MSM tries to do these days is get you to hate the concept of freedom by smearing anyone who values it unless it fits the narrative.",

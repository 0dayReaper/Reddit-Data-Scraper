Everyone still has power and food and room to move and work. I know it\u2019s 2017 and it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, but fuck. We did this for ourselves. We as humans have grown as a civilization to sustain a population of 1.6 million people within a 22 sq mi area. We\u2019re pretty amazing.",

Not only that, but when you swing from building to building, the neighborhood name would show at the top of the screen. \n\nFuck the missions--I spent the rest of the weekend swinging around the city and memorizing the neighborhood names. Chelsea, Meatpacking, Battery Park, Soho... to this day, I credit most of my NY geographical knowledge to that one weekend. ",

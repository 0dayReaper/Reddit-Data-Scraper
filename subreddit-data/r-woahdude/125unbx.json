You're saying that you shouldn't use talent and skill synonymously because talent hints at there being a disposition to do something, while skill shows more of the time someone spent practicing?\n\nBecause I wouldn't say it's that easy. I think it's still a highly debated question about to which extent people aquire or inherit skills or talents. I agree that talent shouldn't be used to justify why someone is or isn't able to do something, saying \"he just has talent\" or undermines the hours of practice that would go into a specific skill. On the other hand I think dispositions are very important in how we develop our skills. I could spend thousands of hours on drawing but I'm not very good at seeing perspective and detail, so I would need some hours more than someone who naturally has a better grasp on perspective. Of course I CAN and will learn that by developing this skill, but another, more dispositioned or more talented person might have an advantage.\n\nBut in this case the term talent wasn't used that way. \"I can show you his many talents\" doesn't imply that we're not talking about the amount of time he practiced, only that he possesses many skills, sometimes on different areas on expertise. In this case it isn't talking about ones natural ability to do things, but what kind of skills he has in general.",

Seriously.\n\nHe\u2019s saying that he uses photoshop to draw out a sketch *as a way to plan out the actual piece that will then be painted on the rock* or whatever else he\u2019ll paint on. It\u2019s a lot easier to do it that way since you can just scrap the digital sketch and start over, not so easy to erase a drawing off a mountain or an iceberg.\n\nI refuse to believe you\u2019re not trolling lol",

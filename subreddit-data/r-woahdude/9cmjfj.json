The coolest kids you remember from sophomore year that were seemed so adult and *together* in your mind's eye were actually squeaky-voiced idiots just like you.\n\nAnd a note to the 16 year olds reading this: yes, I am talking about you. No, you are not different or exempt. But there's nothing you can do about it, so don't let the fact that you're a squeaky-voiced idiot slow your roll. Do you, try to have as much fun as you can, because no matter what you do with these years, you're still gonna look back on them and wince. Just try and avoid making mistakes you can't take back. Wrap it up, don't drink and drive, don't get into a car with someone who's been drinking, don't play with guns, don't kill anyone. And get off my lawn. ",

I fit a spline in each domain, so then I had to figure out how to \"average\" such a function with its inverse, which was cool.\n\nI was thinking this could then be extended to have the different points evolve differently based on what their initial hue was, rather than all rotating at the same rate. Could get some cool dynamics. But haven't tried that yet.\n\nHaven't messed with Fourier on images, that sounds cool too!",

Purple can only be a specific 'measurement' of light. \n\nOur eyes use melanin to detect red, blue and green. There isn't another way for us to detect this, we all see the same measurement unless you are colour blind (where the melanin detectors don't work as intended in your eye)\n\nWe don't deliberate over if people feel different types of heat. We now fire is hot, ice is cold. Light and colour is a bit more complicated than hot and cold but works the same as a sense.",

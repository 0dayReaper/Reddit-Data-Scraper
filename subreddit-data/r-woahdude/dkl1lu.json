The porno was really old. It was a DVD from 2002. It was probably the hottest porn I have ever watched, and from now on I'm going to watch porn on DVD instead of using the internet. The only reason I had Tommy with me was because I feel really depressed and lonely whenever I cum. I thought that he could solve this problem by accompanying me during my masturbation.\n\nWell, I took off all my clothes and started stroking my member with lotion. Soon enough, I was ready to cum. After realizing that I forgot to grab tissues, it was too late. I didn't want to cum everywhere so I had to think fast. Withdrawing myself from the euphoria, I recalled the presence of my turtle and understood what I had to do. I came like a fire hydrant. Cum painted Tommy's tiny little face and splattered across his neck. He didn't say a word about it. He didn't move; indeed, he just stood there, displaying on his face the expression of someone who had just watched the murder of their child. I will never forget Tommy's look of betrayal. His immeasurable disappointment broke my heart.\n\nI put on my clothes; I took Tommy to the bathroom and cleaned him off. What happened, happened. But my turtle will never forgive me. I passed by him just now, and I could see in his eyes the memory of what I had subjected him to those three hours ago. I only wish that one day, Tommy the turtle will accept my atonement for what I have done.",

I kept getting alerts telling everyone to get off the road except for trucks. Problem was there was another storm behind me meaning I couldn't stop because I'd get buried in snow in the middle of Wyoming but I had to go slow enough to stay on the packed-snow road, still sliding all over the place. I couldn't see the road or differentiate between the road and the snow Bank. Passing the semis though... those were the scariest moments. I knew they wouldn't be able to stop or slow down after I passed them but I had to pass them... the wash they left made seeing literally impossible. \n\nI made it out alive and a much better driver lol.",

My wonderful but gutless Toyota was going slow and before long a semi began to pass me.  As he merged back over into my lane, I saw a shower of sparks under his trailer and I thought he had thrown a cigarette out his window.  That is, until I saw his trailer lurch upwards and something begin to spiral towards my window in what seemed slow motion.\n\nMy brain instinctively had me throw my arms up in the air as the long object hit my hood and my front window exploded.  My eyes were shut tight as glass rained over my face and body.  With my eyes closed I coasted to a stop and slowly began to pick glass off my face so I could open my eyes.  All the while I felt something pressed against my side.\n\nSomeone ran to my truck, opened the door, and said, \"My god, are you ok?\"\n\nIt turns out that the truck lost an axle and it came through my window and embedded itself in my seat.  It didn't scratch me but was close enough where my body pressed up against it as everything settled.\n\nThat night as I waited for my window to be replaced so I could get back on the road, 21 year old me decided to live a little and go get my first tattoo.\n\nI got Chinese characters.\n\nFuck.",

Had been driving some 38 hours straight (college classes started in a day or so and I was a stupid 19 year old) from my job in  Vermont to Portland Oregon. There was no radio so it had been just me and my thoughts for a long time. Not a car in sight for a dozen miles up ahead so I figured, what the hell, and just floored it for several minutes... going downnnnnnnhill. I think the speedometer topped out at 110 mph, maybe 120, but the needle was way past the last numerals and chattering away against the far end of the top range like it wanted to bust through and out the other side.\n\n I'm sure other readers have gone faster, but I promise you nothing is as wild as 120+ mph in a tiny 4 cylinder VW, shooting down an incline that goes on forever and ever, sun rising up behind you, hanging on for dear life in a car that's about to shake itself apart. \n\nOne of those amazing private, unshared (until now) moments. I dream about it sometimes.\n\nFor those concerned, car seemed fine after. Didn't overheat or catch on fire. I was definitely hallucinating by the time I rolled into Portland. Do not recommend traveling across country without stopping except for gas.",

I wish more would do so, but I don't need people to do special things just cuz of me, I just know flashing lights cause seizures among others as well, and migraines.  I am very grateful for the warning up front so I could pass by quickly.... even tho I went back for a quick look and regretted it.  You are an awesome person.  God bless you.",

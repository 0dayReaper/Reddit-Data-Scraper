The imagery of Mahakala is very slice n dice, but he\u2019s not nasty, he\u2019s cutting through our afflictions and bullshit! These two are also protectors as they are a form of him. They are charnel ground pals. Doing the dance! Never seen them carved on a skull like this, very wild. Have a great day!",

            "comment": "AI will put so many actors out of a job it\u2019s crazy. \n\nThe whole subject of AI is insane and fascinating\u2026.ofc the politicians, at least here in the US, are ill prepared to approach the subject. It\u2019s my opinion that we need to hit the pause button and try to think about the ramifications of AI. It\u2019s as if the train just started moving and it\u2019s going to be out of the station in a few quick seconds. Another quick analogy is we\u2019re putting a handgun in a 2 year olds playpen while they\u2019re sleeping and we\u2019ll just hope for the best. Cheers all \ud83d\ude42",

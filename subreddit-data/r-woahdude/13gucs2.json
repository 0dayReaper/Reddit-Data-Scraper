Both the ability to focus on something moving with respect to the background, and interpret emotional state from gait patterns. This is why uncanny valley exists for CGI, and why people find Boston Dynamics robots creepy (their gait is off). \n\nWe can't pay attention to everything. The best survival odds were for creatures who could filter out unimportant information. We can't smell like canines, but holy cow can humans register tiny changes in eyelid and lip positions (the primary way we judge emotional state).\n\nIt's a form of \"maladaptive development\". When we developed under certain conditions, but then conditions changed. Our brains had to use a really fast method of seeing someone and within fractions of a second, deciding whether to jump into self-defense mode. It's a flawed mechanism, but it's fast because it had to be. And because of this, racism and xenophobia exist. Because a deep subconscious part of our brain wants to divide everyone into \"my tribe\" and \"not my tribe\".\n\nI agree with your point, there's probably slight perspective errors, textures, shadows, etc, in AI generated video. But our brains are going to pick up on tiny flaws in faces, hands, and movements.",

It doesn't understand how fingers work, so it does an approximation of what a block with 5 or so lines coming out of it. Not knowing how hands actually work means that lines(fingers) can go any which way, and it looks about the same to the AI. \n\nOn the other hand, we see and use hands on a regular basis, so anything out of the ordinary really pops out to us.  Combine those two things, and you get what appears to be extremely odd outcomes.  Until we feed AI millions of images of hands doing hand things, it won't ever get them right.  This is why faces tend to turn out really well. There is no shortage of face pics on the interwebs.",

Deciding what parts of the corpus it integrates, at what rate, is a human choice made by the programmer. People, I think, are pretty blind to how much of an AI is designed by a team of programmers. It's not a virgin conception, a pure tool that manifests out of a box. It's built and fine tuned by people with specific perspectives, goals, and blind spots.\n\nWe've seen the results of blindspots with the AI police are attempting to use for facial recognition. It's significantly more successful at white faces, and falls apart at sorting black or Asian faces.",

And the specific, living human being who sets the parameters for what a \"good\" answer is, and tells it to keep seeking similarly good answers.\n\nFor example, the current chatGPT model is *not racist* because there is an entire team of hired moderators who spend 8 hour shifts telling it what counts as racist, and that racism is a \"bad answer.\" There's literally hundreds of staff involved in telling ChatGPT what the limits of polite society are.\n\nThat's a very good thing, mind you. I like that they're doing that. It's just a very clear instance where we can point to active human intervention in the data corpus.\n\nAI is highly, highly curated and influenced by those who moderate, program and fine tune it.",

No creativity, just rote application of a *technique*.\n\nIt's what made art so depressing in a lot of ways. From the Vatican museum in Rome to some MFA exhibitions, they all felt repetitive at an emotional level. \n\nBut *this*. This AI stuff. Holy fuck. *Because* it's devoid of humanity, it's sucking me in. \n \nHumans are boring as *hell*, and this AI generated material has soaked my brain in something I can't grasp. So alien and unhuman that I just can't get enough. \n \nI hope this is the future of art. Eventually our children and our children's children will have exposure to AI art at younger ages and they'll be far more comfortable with it than we are now. Eventually AI generated art will get so good, it'll put traditional art education in such an underfunded state that true artists will have no choice to focus on comp sci to express themselves at a level that previous generations simply couldn't imagine.",

A couple years back, I spent months trying to make something even close to this with a more primitive AI like VQgan or even old deep dream. Here\u2019s one from a couple years back, https://youtu.be/sPqj3jp__js that user was a pioneer of AI image generation to video software, that was the coolest thing any of us had ever seen at the time.\n\nIt\u2019s also not AI video in the first place.

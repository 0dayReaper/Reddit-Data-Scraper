Let it sit overnight, and as the ice melts, the dye on top will seep through the melt water.\n\nDye powder is normally highly diluted when you tie dye. Like a tablespoon for a 16 oz bottle. With this method, the dye is much more concentrated, which is why you get deeper colors. But since the ice melts slowly and consistently, the dye will seep in pretty much where you sprinkle it, with very little bleeding, and with a lot of soak time.\n\nThe only problem with this method is what the video cut out. When you tie dye garments, you need to rinse and ring out all the dye (basically the rinse water needs to run clear) before washing it. And with this method, it takes A LOT of work to rinse out all that concentrated die. I did a hoodie once and, no joke, it took me almost an hour to rinse that one thing.",

The dye molecules bond better with an alkaline, and the soda ash provides that. But the stuff is a skin irritant, so you'll want to use latex gloves when handling it.\n\nOnce you've added the dye, the fabric will need to sit undisturbed for several hours until the dye is fully absorbed.\n\nAt this point, the dye is bonded but you've got a bunch of extra dye / powder still on the garment. This is why it's really important to rinse it out throughly, the rinse water must be pretty clear. Otherwise, the excess dye will bleed, get reabsorbed over time, and ruin your colors.\n\nEDIT: My wife also just reminded me that if you are dying brand new clothes, make sure to wash it first. Some of the preservatives they use can prevent dye from sticking.",

Ice dying is a much softer less defined look.\n\nEdit: A downvote? Nice. Reddit: where the facts and points mean nothing. Look, the ice disperses the color, making more of a water color instead of a precise application. Like a blogger said \"I compare it like this: tie-dye is coloring with magic markers, and ice dye is painting with watercolors.\" \n\nThe [colors split when ice dyed:](https://preview.redd.it/w26mdcq9bht61.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=65d99e8a752e3645922bb49c1e7bada884dcf83c) making patterns and additional colors. The whole process is the OPPOSITE of precision of traditional dying. Which is why there is such nice blending in the finished product here.",

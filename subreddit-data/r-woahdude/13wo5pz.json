You can also see green and orange cloudy veil. The green one is from airglow which is a natural faint emission of light propagated by the Earth's atmosphere. It's visible on astrophotography when conditions are good (especially light pollution). Even if the airglow can take a red or orange tint, the orange in the video is also due to the Calima. It's a wind from the east that bring in Canares island fine sand and dust frome Sahara Desert.\n\nTenerife is a good place for astrophotography, even if it's not the best sky quality (because of cities belows), the caledera is quite high with around 2500m and is always above a sea of \u200b\u200bclouds that protect it from artificial light of the cities that are under the clouds.\n\nFor this timelapse I used an equatorial mount to do long exposure shot. I use a Star Adventurer mount with 45 sec exposure in astrolapse mode.\n\nSettings : 236 pictures at 45 seconds - ISO-2000 - f/2.2   \nEquipment : Canon 6D - Skywatcher Star Adventurer - Sigma ART 20mm",

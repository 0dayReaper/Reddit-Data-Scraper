It's still one of the big cities but it's essentially a smaller version of Amsterdam without all the tourists.\n\nHaarlem is also nice to visit and it's close to Amsterdam. Both are like 25 minutes travel from Amsterdam, but the longest travel here is like 2,5 hours by train from the bottom to the top of the country. You should also ask at your hotel / hostel, they can generally tell you the perfect spots around you! ",

I can't even get from one side of the state I live in to the other in less than 8 hours.\n\nOn one hand, it's really cool because we have so much nature and there's really just a lot of shit in this country to see, but at the same time Europe has such an awesome dense mishmash of cultures. You really don't have to go far at all to experience something completely different.\n\nAlthough to be fair, traveling to the bible belt in the US is like going to another planet where spaghetti sauce contains ketchup and they won't sell wedding cakes to gays. I guess in a way, the u.s. is basically like a bunch of little countries all circled in one big heap that should not be grouped together. Like Africa but less genocide (so far.. never too late for a civil crisis). We even got ourselves a shiny ~gold~ orange coloured crazy person to run the country! ",

Make a reservation, they get busy.  You can do it online.  For some reason Dutch food isn't all that popular around here, so it's kind of tough to find restaurants that serve it. Surinamese food is all over and amazing, so give that a try while you're here.  For the best apple pie and whipped cream in Amsterdam, go to Winkel 43.  Don't skip the whipped cream, it's the best part.  \n\nMost people go to the Heineken Brewery, but honestly it's completely touristy and not great.  The breweries I actually recommend are Oedipus Brewing and Brouwerij 't IJ.  Brouwerij 't IJ is right next to/part of a windmill too, so that's a convenient one to hit.  If you're just looking for a good bar, there's one called Vespers not far from Central Station.  It's pricey but has amazing drinks.  James Bond themed, if you can't tell from the name.\n\nAnne Frank House is here, and that's worth a visit.  Book your tickets online well in advance or be prepared to stand in an hours-long line.  Van Gogh Museum and the Rijksmuseum are both cool to see, though I'd pick Van Gogh if I only had to choose one.  They're really close together though, so it's very easy to do both in one day if you're interested.  The iconic \"Iamsterdam\" sign you see in pictures is in between them.\n\nIt's beautiful here and summer is a great time to visit, I hope you enjoy your trip!\n",

I don't know where it was or if it was even real.\n\nI remember getting into a train/tram like this somewhere in the USA, there were two trains right next to each other, I think they had gold/bronze trimming so the whole place was super shiny. When we got into the train there was some announcement of something that I can't recall, the tram/train lurched forward towards the \"Warp gate\" and it felt almost instant, not sure if I passed out and woke back up without noticing since I used to do that a lot as a kid, but as soon as it started moving forward, we were at our destination like within the same second. It was a trip.\n\nI still don't know where I was, or what drugs my mom gave me, but that will always stick with me as one of coolest memories.",

I found this story on a message board when that box was released. No idea if it\u2019s true but it\u2019s hilarious:\n\n&gt;I just received my box set in the mail this afternoon. I was at the two summer Paradiso shows and it was one of the most fun I've ever had. I met Trey at De Dampkring coffeeshop the day of or the day before the show (can't remember), which sits right in front of one of the canals. He walked in with a friend and walked up right next to me at the bar and ordered a beer. A friend of mine and I sat down with him and offered to puff him down with some Super Shiva, which his friend and he obliged. He was tripping balls. Said his friend and he were trying to find a place to rent bicycles. Asked him to sign an autograph for me on the back of a coaster (didn't have anything else with me.) He signed it \"Johnny Jordan Paw.\" Whatever weirdness came of his trip was probably where he got the \"back of the worm\" theme that went down at the shows. The shows were incredible. \n\n&gt;The Paradiso, if you didn't know, was a church converted into a club. It was such an incredible venue to see them play; intimate, couldn't have been more than 500 people there, an amazing balcony, and stained glass windows that lit up during the show. You could walk right in with a three-foot bong in one hand and your ticket in the other. On the first night, as soon as they started playing, someone handed me a joint that was about a foot long and as thick as a balled fist. Puffed and passed. Next I was passed a giant pitcher of magic mushroom tea loaded with mushrooms. Drank some of the tea and passed. It felt like Trey was playing not more than five feet away from me. No railing to keep fans away that I recall or stage up really high, it was like you were at a private party and Phish was playing. It was such a surreal time and place. \n\n&gt;After the second night, while my friends and I were walking out, Trey came out from an alleyway and called my name. I was amazed he remembered my name how hard he was tripping when I had met him. Asked me if we had any weed. We had a little bong we bought at a store and had good herb but no water. We ended using some of the Heineken he was drinking for water in the bong. When I asked him why he had decided to play two separate encores, his reply was that he had eaten some space cake prior to the show and it was really starting to kick in and he just didn't want to stop playing. We took a picture with him right there in the alleyway behind the Paradiso. Such fun. I've had the shows on tape for years, but it was a shit recording, and I am so very happy they released this as a proper box set.",

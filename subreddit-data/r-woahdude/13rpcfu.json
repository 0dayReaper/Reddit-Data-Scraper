And this is a common misconception so I don't want you to feel like I am coming at ya or anything, but let's not discredit the fact that Adam Jones is responsible for most of the *collaborations* with Alex, and that the majority of said collaborations are most certainly not \"most\" of the amazing visual art catalog that the band has created over the years. \n\nIn fact, there have been a few contributions from various influential visual artists that contribute to the *sonic* side of things that he is most known for. If you do a quick wikipedia search you will see, or I can update my post here with some info later.\n\nAdam himself actually started in visual F/X with the Stan Winston creature team in the early 80's, and has worked on Aliens, Jurassic Park, Predator 1 and 2 (I believe, again, not searching right this minute) and a few others. He also helped make the Three Little Pigs music video by Green Jelly, and every TOOL music video is designed and executed by his and the rest of the bands collaborative vision. \n\nDon't mean to come off as \"ackshuwally\", but his music and art has been a big part of my life for a while, and while I appreciate the influence from Alex, it feels a little dismissive to say that he is responsible for most of the art, when in reality it was contributed and collaborative, and later on the influence was evident.\n\nSorry for the wall of text. Shit week at work and I am just now able to wind down.",

So I put in various rubber bands in varying amounts of tightness/looseness, and immersed it in a fairly weak bleach/water solution. You want to wash it with detergent right away after you take it out so the bleach doesn't eat away the fabric. (this was rayon)\n\nSo the most tightly-bundled places keep the most dye, and the looser places keep *some* dye, and it's all very inexact and unpredictable. \n\nBut what I ended up with was a pale greenish-yellow shirt (the color of glow-in-the-dark things in daylight! yay!) with non sequitur emerald green and peacock teal chain rings.\n\nI wore it til it fell apart.",

In other words, a \"reducing bleach\" would be a solution of sulfurous and hyposulfurous acid?

Given the ones that go so high are usually no higher of an edition than 10 or 15, but still. People outside the hobby would be speechless seeing the money thrown around in the scene. Ive also traded single pins for as large as 3 x 4ft original canvas paintings from some well known artists. \n\nAll collectible hobbys are this way. Pokemon, magic (a friend sold a black lotus card he FOUND in storage for 30k one day, paid off his college debt instantly), sneakers as long as theyre limited edition runs, art prints (this scene is wild, ive seen people pay 5k for a print that sold out 5 minutes prior for 500). Hell theres even reptile keepers who are this way, the price on \"rare\" color morphs can be astronomical compared to the regular pet. Snake keepers, certain gecko species, etc. \n\nThe best way to look at this shirt is an original piece of art. Its not a limited edition run, its the same as getting a hand painted canvas, ink, woodcut, etc. Its a piece of art from an artist.",

It is painted on hardboard primed with Michael Harding acrylic primer using a gloss paint roller. Two coats of that primes, blocks any staining and provides a good tooth (it replaces both sizing and gesso). I like hardboard because I sometimes sell prints and an enlarged/shrunk irregular texture I find much nicer than an enlarged/shrunk canvas texture.",

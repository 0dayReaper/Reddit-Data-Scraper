As far as #6 I personally like the colors purple and teal and feel they work well together and I like the pattern. Hope this helps your decision. Would like to know what you end up choosing either way. Good Luck!",

It's interesting to hear that you appreciate the combination of purple and teal in artwork #6, along with its appealing pattern. Your insights are indeed helpful in making a decision. I will try to keep you updated on the final selection, and I appreciate your well wishes. Good luck to you too!",

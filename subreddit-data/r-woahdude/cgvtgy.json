And the wet paint would probably have some glinstering in it. \n\nAnd also he has some fake stencils laying on the ground but none of them are used for the heart, ladder or girl. \n\nAlso the heart has a drip on it, which could be purposly but it can also mean lack of can control. And the way he fills up the heart should **probably** give more drips.\n\nAnd last but not least, I have never been into the streetart community but if you steal someone elses work in the graffiti scene you better prepare for an asskicking or a crosswar.\n\nNow I think the streetart scene is a bit more leniant, but it is still considered a dick move. Especially if you bite famous work like this.\n\nEdit\u300b and one more thing, the way he holds the can when he sprays the ladder is just fucked up. You are going to shoot air out of your can and the paint will come out as blobs of paint showing massive splatter on the wall. No way he could get a clean line lkke that",

They actually increase editing expenses because you spend a lot more time trying to make footage look cohesive that really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s much easier to cut something with a bunch of long single take shots than something like a Bourne film. In the end though it\u2019s cheaper to pay an editor for a few extra weeks of edit than it is to pay an entire production crew for a few more days of shooting.",

They just made a digital version of the ladder and displayed it like graffiti.\n* You can see a hidden cut masked by him moving over the ladder 6-7 seconds in, warping the ladder at sec 8 to make it more fluid.\n* Him temporarily moving out of frame at 15 second must be hiding something, don't think its just to reveal the other guy\n* Him moving up and the guard running through the ladder are two different shots compiled together. I imagine he jumped just off screen or just had an empty slate to cover him. \n* The end is him just half hanging over the edge and then climbing back over.",

The ladder isn't there at first, then the ladder is placed there by someone who is masked out using the info from the first shot, then the ladder is removed using the same method. \n\nThe paint on the wall is all a digital effect. They'll have cut out the ladder from a frame in the video and used some sort of 3D graphics software to digitally wrap it to the wall. You can actually see the transition from digital to real if you look closely at the base of the wall at 0:08.",

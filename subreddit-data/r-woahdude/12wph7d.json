Some of those are small sink holes with depths in excess of 150 feet or more. There is a book that is no longer in print that some old school cave divers still have that maps out quite a few of them. As a kid there was a 7/11 in my neighborhood that had a little pond about the size of 2 semi trucks next to each other in the middle of the parking lot. No one ever thought twice about it until a driver accidently put their car into forward and drove over the little concrete lip onto the steep 10 foot bank into the pond. The driver escaped but the car was lost. All us kids hung around watching the cops and tow truck try to pull the car out. They sent down a diver and said the car was further down than metal cable could reach. The car was never retrieved. We all thought it was just a rain water collector, had no clue.",

We stopped at a roadside stand and got oranges and then to Blue Water springs to see the manatees. I was probably about six years old. It still sticks out in my memory for how beautiful it was.",

There are inferred karst connections/conduits in the great basin that stretch 100s of miles, and if memory serves there are some impressively extensively mapped networks in Europe (Pyrenees in France?), and Australia. \n\nAlso, the \"biggest\" Spring normally refers to the discharge rate, which also doesn't apply here. Not trying to poopoo or minimize but I'm a hydrogeologist and I think it's important to recognize as impressive as that system is there are others that give it a run for its money.",

Is it the actual cake you saw someone\u2019s bake, the recipe for it or the creative video they made showcasing their process? Was it the 3D modelling, the renders, the prints, those applied as street art, the stop motion video of them of the making of video of the entire process? Or perhaps all of it, depending on the context?\n\nIn some cases the *actual thing* being made is completely irrelevant, because it\u2019s clear that the video is made to be algorithmically optimised and that what\u2019s being made in it was discarded immediately.",

Music labels can help boost people's music depending on the strength of the label, much of the rest is a mix of the artist putting effort into marketing via social media and luck in terms of some music curator for a popular TV show or film choosing one of their songs or some random TikTokker chooses one of their songs on something that goes viral.",

The voice can be heard loudly, but not clearly. Explaining to people that it's nazi shit does not amplify the voice, it clarifies what the voice is saying.\n\nIf you're looking to \"kill off\" this connection, might I suggest starting with your local Nazis?\n\nps it's weird that the artist landed at 88 frames and the number is so prominent.

The swastika is the obvious example here but they do it a lot.

If it's bad, it's theirs and we will stop it.\" The people that actually generated the symbol are, at best, relegated to a sort of backdrop for the Nazi receiving the symbol that they believe they have, in fact, owned all along. \n\nThe Nazi believes that the value of the symbol only exists as expressed from a pure Nazi mind.  Authenticity is based on purity (whiteness). The context or origin is not much relevant, serving only to be translated and expressed in the frame of white society.\n\nAsk anyone that's seriously into metal or punk music about spotting Nazis.

You'll also see it as 1488 where the \"14\" references the 14 points of White Nationalism along with the traditional 88 from above.  Anytime you see someone using 88 start paying attention to the context, the source, or the intended audience to get an idea if what you're seeing is White Nationalist/Nazi propaganda or just an unfortunate coincidence.",

Asking yourself this simple question can save a lot of embarrassment, and help you identify actual risks and fascists rather than spiral inward in paranoia.",

Do the math and it works out to, you guessed it, 88 frames. Actually 87.5, but it seems reasonable that the renderer might have rounded up and spit out thag 88th frame in this case.\n\nEven if the numbers weren't that perfectly clean, you can still just assume that the artist animated the thing at a speed that felt right and it just turned out to be 88 frames. Or you can assume that the number 88 is just an appealing number due to the repetition of a number which has a lot of value to someone who has an interest in the maths of digital information. Or any other reason that the loop could be 88 frames.",

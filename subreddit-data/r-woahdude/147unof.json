I mean for sure they can have a smell to their cages but I was surprised how much they can clean their fur, similar to how cats do it. At most I remember their fur smelling a bit like popcorn, and only when they are older. Most of my prejudices about rodents went out the window when I realized *how* intelligent they are, and even to a degree the ones I had were potty trained. They'd motion and do certain anxious behaviors if they wanted to go to the bathroom. If you didn't take care of it they would just go wherever they could eventually but they did generally go from peaceful to more animated if they either wanted to go to their usual bathroom spot (it tended to be a roughly consistent spot or spots where we housed them) or were really hungry.",

Eventually they didn't really feel fear and enjoyed standing on shoulders or heads to get a good view. I was also really impressed how with one particular rat she seemed to notice about her claws. Early on they would dig into skin when climbing and we'd say our pains and flinch. It seemed she actually understood this and adjusted how she latched on to not scratch us with claws nearly that much in time. Their intelligence and nonverbal communication was impressive and it really made me sad how often they've been used for lab rat experiments despite potentially being wonderful creatures deserving of care. I remember some friends being surprised how a wild squirrel was once very calm with me (and only me there) and climbing all over me as I didn't feel fear and in fact had some affection from my experiences with rats.",

It's true that at its simplest form this is what is going on: we are occupying our attention with multiple things at once to be entertained like rats in a wheel. I agree with this sentiment. \nBut at the same time, it does seem qualitatively different for the events one is directed towards to be intimately interactive and actively drawing your attention rather than the more spontaneous happenings such as watching cars cross the street. It's come in degrees for sure, like radio is more all engrossing of one's attention than watching cars pass and television is more engrossing than radio and same for the internet and television. All the same, the internet is a significant step up for its personalization options, where each experience vying for your attention can be selected for at the individual level, and for its ubiquity throughout our life, i.e. the fact that I have access to the phone 24/7. These I don't think we're on the table for our previous occupying activities, and the consequences of these differences are dire, and such consequences tend to be interpreted most easily from a moral lens. To say that there are no relevant differences at a fundamental level is to imply that there are no dire consequences that need to be attended to, and thus the uneasiness of the OP. \n\nJust my perspective anyways, take it as you would.",

Then we invented the television and it became the most stimulating thing per energy spent. And then we invented the internet and it became the most stimulating thing per energy spent. \n\nSo I really think the internet is a problem for the human race, because it's almost the perfect stimulation tool. Cheap, socially accepted, and widely accessible 24/7. Sex is more stimulating, but for less time and for far more energy (not just the act itself but also the energy spent setting up tinder profiles, talking to matches, going on dates, etc etc). Drugs are more stimulating, but with huge downsides that reduce our overall stimulation such as risk of prison time that would bring your stimulation down to nearly zero.\n\nThere are plenty of things on Earth that are more stimulating, but what sets the internet so far apart everything else is that is requires so little energy from us. We just sit in front of these screens and move our fingers a bit occasionally and we just get fed constant stimulation. It's so efficient that it's scary.",

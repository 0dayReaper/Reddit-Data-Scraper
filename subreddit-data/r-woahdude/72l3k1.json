It is thick on one end and tapers to a thin or sharp edge on the other end. Technically it is an inclined plane (or two inclined planes put together to form a triangle) that moves. A wedge may be attached to a handle to make it easier to use. Good examples of wedges are nails, knives, axes and your teeth!\n\nA wedge can be used in many ways:\n\n*  To cut (knife)\n*  To split (axe)\n*  To tighten and to hold back (doorstopper)\n*  To hold together (nail)\n*  To scrape (blades on the snowplough or farm grader)\n\nWedges work by changing direction and force applied to it.\n\nA wedge may be a single wedge or double wedge. Each does a slightly different job. An axe is a double wedge and a chisel is a single wedge.\n\n**Trade-off:**\n\nThe longer and thinner a wedge is (sharper), the more work it does with little effort. If the wedge is shorter and has a wider angle at the tip, one needs more force to do the work. \n\nThe mechanical advantage of a wedge is higher when the wedge is longer with a thinner tip.\n\nWedges have been in use for millions of years. Earlier humans used wedges made of hard rocks and stones to hunt (like spears), cut and trim trees and carve stones. The concept of wedges is also used in jets and modern cars. You will notice that jets, fast cars, speed boats and trains have pointed noses. This helps them cut through the air (air acts as a resistance). This feature of pointed noses cutting through air is known as aerodynamics. \n\n[Source](http://eschooltoday.com/science/simple-machines/what-is-a-wedge.html)",

In my state sports are pretty huge also, with high school football being king. You can get more practice hours in for athletics if school is over at 230 vs 430. Also, my particular district (and I assume most public school districts) didn't have enough busses for elementary, middle, and high school to all get out at the same time. It had to be staggered so some busses could finish a full route and come back for more. ",

A lot of people like to have a glass of wine or two with lunch then take a nap before returning to finish the day. It sounds too good to be true but it really is a real thing practiced in a few countries lol. There's even a city in Spain that has the siesta ingrained into law. They also usually have different siesta times for restaurants and bars so that the rest of the population can eat during theirs.",

This is in extreme circumstances too... And one time i got so excruciatingly tired while driving home that i had to keep shaking my head every five minutes to shake off the road hypnotism. But in general i find it hard to be relaxed enough to sleep in those situations. Ill feel the inertia sometimes but I\u2019ve never actually nodded off. Ever. ",

We were in a parade in which I held a flag with one of those belt holsters.  We had to walk down the main street a couple of miles then stand in front of a memorial while politicians gave speeches.\n\nBy the time the speeches started I was feeling dizzy.  It got worse and worse.  I was standing there telling the scout next to me my head was spinning. I don't recall him responding. The next moment I realized I was crouching with the flag.  I didn't remember moving into a crouching position. I stood up.  The next thing I knew I was was down again, this time sitting with my legs out in front of me in front of everyone watching the speeches. I was trying to get up and things started spinning wildly. The next thing I knew someone had rushed forward from the crowd to pull me back out of the line, as I was certainly going down.  I was put in the back of a police car with the door open to get shade and air while given some water.\n\n\nThis animation brings that memory back.\n",

If your knees are bent a little bit then the muscles contract and act as a bit of a pump to help facilitate getting blood out of the legs and up to the head",

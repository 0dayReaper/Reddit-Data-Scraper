The beacons provide both horizontal and vertical guidance so that all you have to do is line up the beacon markers horizontally, set a particular downward *glideslope* (that lines up with another beacon), and you should be on the perfect approach.\n\nThese days many systems are even more sophisticated and completely controlled by the autopilot, so the human pilot need to nothing other than verify everything is correct.  The airplane's GPS also tells the pilot exactly where the plane is at all times, so it's easier to spot if something is off.",

One is a pair of horizontal signals that's in line with the runway, the other vertical at an angle called the glideslope. Instruments in the airplane receive these signals and tell the pilot - and in the case of modern airliners, the autopilot - where the plane is in relation to the glideslope.\n\nIn the cockpit this can be anything from a set of needles on an old-timey looking gauge to a visual indication on a screen in front of the pilot.\n\nThe newer the version of ILS the fancier it gets.  Really fancy autopilot systems are capable of landing the plane based on these signals as long as they're being transmitted by a really fancy ILS system.",

Equipped planes are auto land capable, but it's not ideal or preferred by most pilots or ATC. It's very ideal to have in these types of scenarios, though. \n\nThat said, it looks like this approach would be landable without autopilot assistance. ",

It also requires a bigger safety margin time wise, so the queue for planes to get on the ground grows longer.\n\nThose are the most obvious examples I believe. It can't handle the same amount of wind shear and some other maneuverability things as well.",

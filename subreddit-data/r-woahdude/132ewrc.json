Between that weather and Close Encounters, it would actually make sense to have distance communication by light patterns with a universally recognized set of patterns to mean different things. What made it odd, aside from the almost morse code-like pattern, was it was during an otherwise perfectly clear day and no air movement and went away after about 30-45 minutes or so",

The unusual part was that there was very little rain and no sound coming from the lightning at all overhead. Occasionally one could hear a rumble that lasted way too long, I mean way too long but that was it. In my years I have seen lightning hit the ground (or rise up apparently) just a few yards from me and I remember that sound being pretty deafening.",

The clouds when that high up are way further up than we realize. Also when the lightning is so high altitude it isn't connecting with the ground. It's the clouds that are ao charged it is cloud to cloud lightning. Hence no sound. It isnt close to us nor grounding out. No boom.",

You may not see the rain in person if it is evaporating before it gets to the ground. Are you sure there is nothing in your area that produce noises like thunder, like a highway with heavy trucks going by or an industrial site. Especially if it is constant thunder like sounds but no storms in the area. Certain atmospheric conditions can make it easier for sound to travel further like a low cloud layer allowing sound to easily bounce back and forth instead of going up straight up high in the sky.\n\nI hope don't take offense to this but are you also sure you know how to properly read radar and are using the correct products. I've had plenty of friends send me pics of models or weirdly stiched together radar products and completely misunderstand what is actually happening",

Tom recognized the man as the person who had transformed into a monstrous caricature of the man who stood before them complete with a mouth full of knives and eyes made of fire.\n\n\"So, Professor Wahreslicht, I see the machine had been unveiled at last.\" The large man beamed at them both. \"Are you ready for your demonstration?\"\n\nThe professor glanced at Tom, narrowed his eyes, and made a tight lipped grin. Then he turned to the big man and a professional smile slid down over his face. \"No, Baron, I am afraid in transport the machine has been damaged. This gentleman was attempting to help me adjust it but I regret nothing can be done. I must return to my laboratory to effect repairs.\"\n\nThe big man looked disappointed. \"Too bad, sir. I was very much hopping to see this ethereal light that you spoke about in your paper. My curiosity was piqued.\" The man glanced down at the professor and for a moment Tom had the odd impression the man might bend down and bite the professor directly in the face.\n\n\"Well, science is a harsh mistress I suppose. I hope to have you to my next affair, professor. Write when you have everything working again.\" The man paused then waved his hand and wandered back to join the other party guests.\n\n\"So you see the truth now, yes?\" The professor stared at Tom directly. \"To show these people their true nature would be a mistake I think. So, back I go to my laboratory for more work and perhaps to find a better way to introduce the world to my discovery.\" This last was said as the little smile returned to the professor's face.\n\nTom just stood speechless. He was overwhelmed. He didn't know what to say, what to do, or even how to feel. He just stood numb and cold.\n\n\"Yes, it is a lot to take in\" the professor called over his shoulder as he began to wheel the large black tripod with it's unusual device out f the room. \"But remember it is the truth. Nothing more and nothing less. What can be done with that information I leave to you.\" This last was said as the profess disappeared through a curtain covering the rear entrance.\n\nTom stood watching the people dancing and talking and moving and drinking. The clothes were expensive, the jewelry sparkled, the gold leaf glowed and the champagne flowed as it had from the very first minute the party had begun. Tom took it all in but he knew it was a lie. The real truth was hidden just beneath the surface. He would never look at the world the same way again.",

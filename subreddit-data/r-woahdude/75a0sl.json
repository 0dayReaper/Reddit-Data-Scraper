Wisteria is not as aggressive as Kudzu or Japanese Knotweed, but it still out competes native species and ruins the local ecology. Even if the aforementioned plants are manicured and used for ornamental purposes... they will still spread! When gardening or landscaping always use native species endemic to the region!",

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer\u2019s head. There\u2019s also Rick\u2019s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they\u2019re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\u2019t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick\u2019s existential catchphrase \u201cWubba Lubba Dub Dub,\u201d which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev\u2019s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I\u2019m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon\u2019s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\n\nEDIT: He posted a random copy pasta, so I posted a copy pasta. This is a copy pasta.",

Keep at it for a few years if you need to, eventually you'll get it!\nThen you can replant the area with some native species that will support the local ecosystem in your area.\nPurple flowers can be pretty, but for my money I'd rather see butterflies and birds.

When we got through tearing them all out it looked like the aftermath of a  comcast cable installer training yard.  Now it is happily replanted in her back yard, strangling her back fence.",

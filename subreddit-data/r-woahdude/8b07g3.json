This is why after spending a few moments in the dark, you start to see a little better. This capability allows you to be in different lighting conditions, while still maintaining a pretty accurate estimate of the lightness and colour of objects.\n\n[Source](https://www.zmescience.com/other/offbeat-other/troxler-effect-08112011/)",

In the Troxler effect an unchanging stimulus gradually fades away from our visual perception, which seems to be the opposite of being able to see well in the dark?\n\nI thought being able to see better in the dark is due to changes in the sensitivity of rods and cones, due to changes in light levels. But that is called dark adaptation and is nothing to do with the Troxler effect.",

The Troxler effect is caused by neural adaption - basically the visual system is going 'ok this input isn't very informative, so i'm going to ignore it'.  \n\nAdaption to darkness is caused by a different process - build-up of a chemical called Rhodopsin, which rod cells use to detect light in the dark.  Rhodopsin usually breaks down when there is too much light, which is why it takes a minute to build up when you turn the lights off. ",

No idea why someone tried to attribute it to the Troxler's fading, which is my favorite optical illusion.\n\nHere is my favorite use of Troxler's fading: https://i.imgur.com/2Pncrrw.png  Stare at the center cross.\n\nAnother troxler fading you will not be able to unsee is when you are watching someone up on stage who is standing still: the stage, curtains, etc all slowly fade away if you stare at them.  This is part of why people feel more engaged when the person presenting on stage moves around a little instead of standing still.  It keeps your eyes and visual system stimulated.",

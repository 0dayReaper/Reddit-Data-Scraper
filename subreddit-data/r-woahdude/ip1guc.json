It makes no sense that a chest was empty when it could have been filled with treasure like other containers around it.\n\nThere is the possibility that something *was* there and was swiped, but the picture I remember showed that the box was originally piled with many others, so picking that box and cleaning it out while others around it were still filled is too odd. *Don't take this too seriously, I have the memory of a goldfish.*\n\nTbh, definitely evil spirits.\n\nI've seen some people akin it to Pandora's Box. So maybe there's some hope? It needs to fucking hurry though.",

I was born and raised in the region, and that area was basically made to cater to privileged instagrammers who don't care about price. \n\nTwenty years ago you had a much more authentic, down to earth experience. Bacalar and Majahual still capture some of that magic but are very soon turning into tourist hotspots, same with Holbox.\n\nBasically, Tulum got gentrified on the last ten years",

Kind of funny and a bit pretentious. I loved going in the off season cus it felt more authentic and much easier to drive around without the crazy traffic jams. I also got a great hotel on the beach in the off season where I had to get an Airbnb 15 minutes from the town when I was there in January. Prices were crazy cheap in the off season and I definitely prefer it you just have to deal with insane heat.",

I think it\u2019s important, if you\u2019re gonna go, go with some friends, DON\u2019T DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL, stay in main areas, always go with an official tour guide. There are pharmacies there that you can buy prescription drugs that you can only get by a doctor in America, don\u2019t go looking for weed or coke\u2026 That\u2019s a recipe for disaster. I personally would still go again despite what\u2019s happening there, because I go there for the experience and mostly stay inside the resorts anyway which are safe.",

Rented a car in Cancun, drove the 2 hours to Tulum, made friends with the Argentinian owners of our hotel, spent a day at Xel-ha, and helped baby sea turtles make it to the water. The clubs were surprisingly underwhelming. 10/10 would Tulum again.",

Gave him $20 worth of pesos and a bottle of coke, shook hands, took a selfie with him. But I've heard that in the past 5 years, Tulum has really gone off the rails. Massive growth / corruption. Generally speaking, I feel safer in Mexico than I do in the USA.",

Puerto Vallarta I've seen and it was a magnet for poorly behaved vacationing teens and young adults, and the water was constantly polluted from raw sewage. Playa del Carmen was the chillist, nicest place I stayed. Very safe and friendly though that was a long time ago, and all places get worse with tough economic times.",

The gov't has really made efforts to clean it up, both in terms of street life and air quality, to name a few aspects. \n\nMexico City definitely has crime (I've known people to get pickpocketed on the subway, like any big city), but that's primarily because it's a MASSIVE (22M metro) city, not because it's a particularly dangerous place. I've been to a lot of Mexico and never felt unsafe in Mexico City. The culture that's there to experience is so, so worth the trip.",

I spent most of last year living with CDMX as home base and it\u2019s great. Roma and La Condesa are super safe, it\u2019s not uncommon to see women out at night with babies in strollers or nighttime joggers and stuff. They\u2019re upscale areas that have become a bit gentrified and whitewashed with all the digital nomads, but not too badly.\n\nPolanco is fulllll of people with a ton of money and is pretty safe, and Reforma is fairly safe as well. The metro system to and from the stops around these areas has always been fine for me and there\u2019s a heavy police presence both barking and disembarking the trains at busy areas, which discourages any sort of theft or violence on the trains because then someone can just make a scene and the person now has to escape from cops as soon as the train stops.\n\nI\u2019ve been to a few dozen countries and lots of cities, and Mexico City has to be in my top five favorite cities in the world. Awesome people, tons of culture, wonderful food scene, great weather, excellent arts and museums, and so much variety.",

That is terrible, but I don't feel like my city or country should be labelled as unsafe, in the same way that I don't think you can label Tulum as safe or unsafe - it's all circumstantial and changes rapidly.\n\nFor the record, I have heard crime/corruption has gone up in the area in the last 5 years since I was there, as the tourism sector has exploded and a bunch of resorts built. People also recommended that I not go to Culiacan due to the cartel danger, and I had an excellent time. \n\nIn terms of Mexico I'd probably recommend somewhere else than Tulum. Go to the south pacific side.",

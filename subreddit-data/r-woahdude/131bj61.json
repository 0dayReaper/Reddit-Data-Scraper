An interesting thing about the ocean is that red color light from the sun never reaches the bottom because of the way that light penetrates large bodies of water, so most creatures of the deep sea cannot see red  (lobsters and the like actually appear gray / colorless underwater, in case you didn't know).\n\n[Here's an example of the phenomenon.](https://youtu.be/AAJjdA6b4Ts)\n\nSo basically, these creatures from hell swim around the deep ocean with a flashlight **that only they can see** that highlights creatures that are normally invisible to whatever light might reach that distance.\n\nAnd the creatures would often be completely unaware that they are visible, because they cannot see the light.\n\nFascinating, horrifying stuff, and I always love sharing facts about these creatures.",

Now of course your IR flashlight will light you up like the sun to anyone else with night vision.\"",

By a lot of metrics they are intelligent life.\n\nHypothetical situation: you want to elevate ant civilization to the point where they can also explore the galaxy. Where would you even start? You can't talk to them, can't write, can't explain anything in a way that they would understand. You're so far beyond them that it's effectively impossible to communicate even the most basic concepts to even start them on a path where they would get there eventually.\n\nHumans are probably the same, we're the Apex species on our planet and have rudimentary space travel but the gap in intelligence between us and any kind of galactic explorers is probably so vast that we're like ants to them. They might recognize that we exist and have some level of intelligence but they will be so far beyond us that there's no feasible way to communicate.",

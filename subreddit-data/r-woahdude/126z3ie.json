Our vision is very limited(spectrums of light) in general and our brain does this thing where if you expect to see something you see it. Why we do double takes on things then go \"ohhh.. that wasn't what I thought I saw.\"",

Sometimes illusions take a bit of practice and effort, including many like this one which require staring at a fixation point with very minimal blinking or 'saccades' (tiny automatic eye movements) which may both 'reset' the illusion. The brain needs enough consistent, unmoving visual information with the irregular bits outside the central (foveal) region to 'reconstruct' the straight lines, which won't happen if there's continual small eye movements or if the image is too small.",

Whilst, as you say, being speculative with no hard evidence, it makes sense of the multiple situations we know of in which the laws of physics currently break down.\n\nWhat that plain of existence is I doubt we will ever know, if we are even able to 'know' of anything outside of our universe, so it will always remain just a theory.\nThe logic of man has been proven false many times over and the multiverse concept falls in to the homunculus trap, so I'm not placing any bets on it and wouldn't have included it in a video like this.",

The human race is so damn young in comparison to the age of the universe.   \n\nWith respect to \"inteligent\" life on other planets, I agree that the sheer size of the universe give it a pretty good probability. \n  But when people believe (lots of folks I work with) that aliens have visited humans and governments cover it up (area 51, egyptian pyramids and so on), these people are not able to factor in the age of the human race in comparison to the age of the universe.  I am definitely a math and numbers guy, and I can tell you that while I would argue that there probably is life out there somwhere in the universe, the odds of another race inteligent enough to develop space exploration, and be close enough to reach earth DURING THE TINY TIMFRAME OF RECORDED HISTORY ON EARTH, is pretty much zero.  (Im not saying it IS zero, im saying the odds are so close to Zero that it is neglegible.)\n\nAgain consider the universe is estimated to be \n13 700 000 000 years old.",

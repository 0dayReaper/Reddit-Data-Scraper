So, it\u2019s not the same as inventing the camera to capture things that exist already the way a painter would, it\u2019s that these images are being generated, literally, through the efforts of *everything* and *everyone* that came before it.",

Youre literally taking the artists' hard work as part of your dataset without giving compensation or credit. Now, people rly wouldnt have a problem with that if we didnt live under a capitalist framework. \n\nThe really bitter thing about AI art is that it's automation that is positioned to take away the time we have to make art, limiting access to the only way to sustain producing art today, which is to monetize it. As long as automation happens within a capitalist framework, it will always do the opposite of its intended goal.",

People's problem is how fast AI can do it as it does leave a lot of questions for capitalist society like what are artists worth now.\n\nI can't say for sure there arnt other concerns and valid arguments but most of them stem from people being rendered less valuable or misunderstanding how AI actually works.",

I was a homeschooler and sorely lacked social skills. I was bullied all the time and had few friends. But, I could draw. So I would spend my time in class drawing things for people and that's what made me a little popular and got me some friendships. \n\nI was not a super talented artist but I wasn't bad. I ended up getting into a career as a graphic artist to try to capitalize on my creativity. Because of some color blindness I ended up getting into programming and my creativity just slowly died out. \n\nSo fast forward 15 years and I am just now coming out of a deep depression with the help of some medication. As I have gotten to learn AI, I discovered stable diffusion. That started the addiction, I have been working intensely with stable diffusion and InvokeAI for weeks now and it has done wonders for me. \n\nI can finally be a creative again. I can actually paint with a paint brush on my unified canvas and using prompts I can slowly iterate on that to turn it into the thing I envisioned in my mind. Just like a normal paint brush but with a different tool. I can paint with reality. \n\nSo, sure, I know for today's talented artists a lot of us that use AI art can seem like chimpanzees. But for people like me it is a true creative expression and reignites something deep inside my soul again. I'm very grateful for it.",

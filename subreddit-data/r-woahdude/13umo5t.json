At the height of my trip I saw the machine elves and the ego loss was like a DMT experience. It was just much longer than DMT (obviously). And I didn\u2019t feel that sense of oneness...it wasn\u2019t as chill. It was actually kinda scary (crazy ass visions that still disturb me to this day if I think about it).\n\n\nBut after the intense peak the next day was amazing. Sound had a pronounced Doppler effect, the pavement in the parking lot seemed like liquid. The movement of the wind on the trees was very much like an LSD trip. \n\n\nIt was a great experience. But I couldn\u2019t sleep for a couple of days, it\u2019s really quite a commitment. I probably took too much. I didn\u2019t expect to be in an altered state for over 24 hrs",

People on here will load it up like weed and try to rip an entire bowl. Which is the equivalent of trying to drop 15gs off mushrooms for your first time, it's going to be WAY too much and you're probably going to have a terrible time.",

Then i had a really bad trip and 2g changa was just sitting on my shelf for nearly a year. One time a year later i dropped a few tabs of acid and the trip was so nice that i decided to smoke DMT on top of the LSD lmao. That sent me into fractal space tunnels and warped childhood memories, saw the machine elves and the DMT lasted literally 40 minutes. It was a beautiful trip, i was listening to Ab-Soul, Flatbush Zombies, Underachievers (where i got my username from) and Tribe Called Quest all night.\n\nHaven\u2019t done it in about 5 years but i still kind of miss it!",

It looks much cooler than where we started.\n\n It\u2019s so fast now too! 2 years ago, something like this would take half an hour per frame on a rented $20,000 gpu and look not so great. Compares to that, I am always very impressed with the new stuff.\n\nEveryone I keep updated on this IRL also seems impressed. \n\nI guess if there\u2019s too much it might be better on a specific subreddit for that though.",

There are currently people working 2 or 3 careers simultaneously because they are using AI to help them. So its only a matter of time before companies and employers realize that what they were paying 5-10 people to do, they now only need 1 person and AI. If that happens across the board at relatively the same time then we will have some problems to solve. I believe that will happen within the next decade, and I believe that as a solution we will see something like universal basic income.\n\nAnd all that is only the beginning of the  changes we will see from AI, the real fun stuff will happen when we get to General AI and beyond. Questions about art and creativity will seem cute when the new fork in the road presented to humanity is between extinction and immortality. Im not joking, and much of science fiction will start to become reality.",

You're welcome to sign up and upload your own videos (that's all it takes) once you pay. \n\nGranted, *overall* there millions of man hours of knowledge that contributed, in some sort of way, to what is currently being accomplished by Kaiber, but you'd probably be surprised how much these current startups are really just barely scripting together **other companies' APIs** and presenting the results in an easy to use interface. It's currently the wild west out there, so there are hundreds, if not thousands of these kinds of AI startups up and running already. \n\nIt's only going to continue to spread. Automatically generated assets for TV, Movies, Games, etc. Right now, there's some democratization via Open Source and public research papers, but that will eventually go away as well, so who knows what things will be like by that point. Anyway, babbling aside, this is either going to put all artists essentially in a position where they cannot churn enough organic art out fast enough to compete with a *single AI*, let alone thousands of them. Or, you're going to see more of the OP comment's attitude become popular, and it's a thing where artists may be able to survive as a specific niche (IE, \"real\" \"organic\" \"soulful\" or whatever other marketing BS ends up dominating). Who knows, but the transition to whatever it will be is going to be rough...",

Challenging, but rewarding effort.\n\nLocations: Sunrise - East Beach, sunset - Hadleigh Castle, Southend-on-Sea, UK\n\nMusic - Tony Iommi feat. Billy Idol - \"Into the night\" (Iommi, 2000) - Amazing solo album by THE father of metal music, every song with guest vocalist. Give it a go if you enjoy the sound of overdriven electric guitar.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nSpiral out \\\\m/",

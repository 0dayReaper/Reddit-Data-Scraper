The nebula is listed in the Mandel Wilson catalog of Unexplored Nebulae as MW1 and is an example of the Integrated Flux Nebula. These type of nebulae lie in the outer regions of our galaxy and consist of fine dust particles illuminated by reflecting light from the entire Milky Way Galaxy. These clouds are very subtle and present quite challenging targets to photograph.",

So much has been studied about Polaris, but scientists have failed to see the bigger picture. In 2005  amateur astronomer Steve Mandel discovered this extremely faint nebula that surrounds a large area around both the northern and southern pole. This has changed the way we understood nebulas, as previously studied nebulas had a single star that is the central point of energy that created nebulas. However, the integrated flux nebula is illuminated by the flux of the entire Milky Way galaxy, an invisible force we have yet to understand.  \n\\[See the full resolution version on my website\\](http://harryjones.photography)  \n\\[Follow me on Instagram\\](http://instagram.com/harryjonesphotography)  \n\\*\\*Equipment and Acquisition Details\\*\\*  \n\\* Canon 300mm F2.8  \n\\* Canon 6D (Stock)  \n\\* ZWO ASI 220MC  \n\\* ZWO 80mm Guide scope  \n\\* Skywatcher HEQ 5 Pro Synscan Mount  \n\\* 73 x 300\" Subs  \n\\*\\*Post Processing\\*\\*  \n\\* ABE  \n\\* Histogram  \n\\* Unlinked Stretch  \n\\* Unsharp mask  \n\\* Curves  \n\\* Xterminator Suite",

Nebulas are often very big, and are where stars are formed. Google \"horsehead nebula\" for example. You might be referring to those nebula that are created from stellar novas, but they aren'tthe only type of nebula.\n\nI'm not an astronomer thougg",

There's others where the star responsible is off to the side but it's still the \"central point of energy\" such as the California nebula and Xi Persei.\n\nBut even with large star forming nebula, you can point to the massive stars that formed in the nebula and do the majority of illuminating and ionizing the surrounding gas. Like the Trapezium cluster in Orion or the R136 cluster in the Tarantula nebula. \nSo even if there's more than one, we can identify a distinct group of stars responsible for illuminating or ionizing most nebula (dark nebula aside). But with IFN, their light is the ambient light of the galaxy.",

But typically long exposure shots of Polaris have stars around it streaking in a circle. That's because the earth's rotation will cause them to travel through the sky while Polaris is stationary. My assumption is, when you track Polaris, the camera actually rotates on its axis similar to earth on its poles. This would remove the streaking of stars around it.",

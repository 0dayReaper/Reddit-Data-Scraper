I mean, it still is, but we\u2019ve now had decades with it in popular culture for to wrestle with.",

There were many sci-fi novels and shows that inluded this type of assimilation for decades before Superman 3 came out. One that comes to mind is the Cybermen from Doctor Who, which first appeared in 1966 (Superman 3 was released in 1983).",

All the photographer does is press the button.\n\nBut actually that's not the case, as the photographer choses what to include and exclude from the image so the photograph has a unique expression.\n\nSo I'd argue this is art, as the although the artist may not be the computer that calculated the video and may not have created the raw inputs used for the art, they did chose what elements to combine in order to express a new meaning beyond what those elements did by themselves.\n\nArt can be a demonstration of technical skill, but it doesn't *have* to be.",

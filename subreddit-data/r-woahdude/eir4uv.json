Im not artistic but recently found i can draw on grid paper and it keeps getting a little better each time for me. Did yours always look great due to being artistic or did you just teach yourself that skill over time? I find its the best method of stress relief i have and its a creative side i never thought id have. Post an old one so i can see where you started these ideas at",

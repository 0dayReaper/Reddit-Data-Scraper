These are an artist\u2019s interpretation of the three different elohim (spiritual beings) found in the highest heavenly choir; the first is a cherub, the second is a seraph, and the last is a throne. The kind of el (singular of elohim) that are actually called \u201cangels\u201d do in fact take the image of god that is to say they look the same as us humans but often times they are depicted and indeed described as having wings. They are in the lowest heavenly choir along with archangels and principalities which operate mostly on earth to carry out the will of heaven.",

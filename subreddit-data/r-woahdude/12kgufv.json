Some projects use NFTs as access tokens into their communities, as simple as if the person owns one of their NFTs that person can then access gated content in their discord server. Or if you want something more tangible there are record labels that payout song royalties to the holders of the NFTs that represent that song. Snoop is planning on turning Death Row Records into such a label. And yes you can do these things by other means, but the beauty with NFTs is that you can then sell your NFT to someone else when you no longer want it.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nI don't blame people for thinking NFTs are only garbage art used to launder money, its clear that main stream media doesn't understand technology in general, they only report on something if its spicy and disregard any actual info.",

I use stable diffusion to do a lot of things very quickly that used to take me a long time. It's a fantastic tool to add to your work flow. The only annoying thing for me is that many people for some reason won't even accept that much. I've just given up telling anybody I used SD as a tool to help me create x image, because I start getting all this hate, people telling me how much worse it looks etc.\n\n... If I just don't mention it, then everything is fine and it \"looks so much better\" despite nothing being different. I imagine as time goes on people will accept that artists will use it as a tool like anything else in digital art. It's not going anywhere. I think the novelty of images literally straight out of mid journey/Stable Diffusion that don't have any extra human input will quckly wear off.\n\nAI allows artists to do amazing things, some things that previously were not possible. AI Images on their own will always have their uses (stock images, reference/concept work, easy b/g art for indie games... Things like that) but won't be able to stand on their own. Art needs to be more than just an image - which I think photographers understand well. I haven't met one yet who didn't \"get\" it when it comes to AI art and its potential, as well as its weaknesses.",

We\u2019re making that partly for ourselves, or just because we do, not for a true purpose. Art is as old as humanity itself. It comes naturally, it\u2019s part of existence. You can\u2019t delete that. If your art is ruined because of AI, it wasn\u2019t good in the first place. We are above all that and always will be. It\u2019s so interwoven with perception and senses itself, it\u2019ll never stop existing, because art was never invented, it just \u201cis\u201d. \n\nAI art is also really, really generic and obvious. They tend to portray things super literally because that\u2019s what the majority of art does. But art that really sticks, doesn\u2019t do that. You look at it, and you understand what it is. \n\nBad art tells you how to feel and that\u2019s exactly what AI always does. AI art is also static whereas human made art is much more shapes and contrast and light that interrupt each other with thought put behind everything. Human brains are still the superior machines for things as sensitive and powerful as visual art. \n\nAI simply makes calculations and works over-all whereas human made art is much more than mathematics and is vastly different depending on when, where, by who, and countless other factors that may have taken thousands of years to align to create exactly this artwork. Only this image fits with what it communicates directly to our perception, and only that \u201cmeaning\u201d so to speak fits with that image (it doesn\u2019t have to be put into words, it exists in our brains as an abstract feeling-like concept).\n\nTo create AI that makes it instead, you\u2019re inherently reducing what art is.\n\nSensible people will always value human-made art much more because they can appreciate that its flaws and irregularities and dynamic nature makes it much better.",

Musicians probably felt the same way when recordings were first made. \"What, you don't need to hire me to play this anymore, it just plays itself?\" And yet, art continued and even improved. \n\nGood artists and AI users make better stuff than people smashing in random prompts, but random prompts still look better than the first 500h of someone's art career. \n\nDownvotes are everywhere but they won't change anything.

The machine may be able to generate millions of different variations of a particular style, but it can't come up with something completely new on its own.\r  \n\r  \nLack of Emotional Depth: Art is often created to evoke emotions and convey a message or story. However, AI-generated art lacks the emotional depth and complexity of human-made art. It may be aesthetically pleasing, but it does not have the same level of emotional impact or cultural significance.\r  \n\r  \nDependence on Human Input: While AI algorithms can generate images and patterns, they still require human input and guidance to produce art that is coherent and meaningful. Artists must provide input in the form of training data, design specifications, and aesthetic preferences.\r  \n\r  \nLegal and Ethical Issues: There are also legal and ethical issues surrounding AI-generated art. For example, who owns the copyright to the artwork created by an AI algorithm? Is it the artist who trained the algorithm or the machine itself?\r  \n\r  \nReproducibility and Mass Production: AI-generated art can be easily reproduced and mass-produced, which can undermine the value and uniqueness of the artwork. This also raises questions about the authenticity and originality of AI-generated art.\r  \n\r  \nBias and Discrimination: AI algorithms are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the training data contains bias or discrimination, the AI-generated art may also reflect those biases. This raises concerns about the social and cultural impact of AI-generated art.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AI wrote this.**",

It either closes allowing nothing through, opens the urethra for urine, or opens the urethra for semen/ejaculate (you'll understand when you're older). So it's the muscle, so to speak, that you use when you try to stop peeing mid-stream. It can also be squeezed to forcefully eject any liquid remaining in the urethra, therefore manually squeezing it (by pressing up on your taint) will force out any leftover drips, or you can squeeze it by flexing the same way you do when you try to stop peeing (that's basically a kagel exercise).\n\nSorry for using some age-inappropriate terminology.\n\nEdit: turns out I'm somewhat mistaken about this function of the prostate... It isn't a valve. I guess if you say something with conviction and sound like you know what you're talking about people will believe you.",

So much of the art that does well at selling isnt necessarily hard, it just takes bookoos of patience because that pretty bullshit takes fooorrevvverr. For example take photorealistic drawings/paintings, as they are actually pretty easy technique-wise. Most of it is just layering and blending, it's just that there is soooooooo frrrakkkinn much layering and blending. I mean just hours can be spent working on a difficult square inch or two on small poster-sized piece. So to churn out work at a quick enough rate to meet the demand necessary to build a decent clientele base; you gotta just spend hours doing technical work to get every little detail just right. The fun part of getting the idea out of your head and onto your medium happens in like the first 20% of the process usually. Now obviously there are successful artist that don't do highly technical work, and can bang out an awesome piece in a few hours or even less. Also there are hyperrealistic or highly technical artist that just have a talent for it, but I would say a good comparison to this talent is photographers. In photography there are a ton of people that can take great pictures on a consistent basis. But then exist those select few, that using the same techniques as every other photographer, just take it to a whole different level where their pictures are just damn near perfect. But overall it still comes down to patience in my opinion, as I know many great artist (and decent ones like myself) that aren't working as one because as much as we all love art, it's just hard to make it a 40-80 hour a week job. \n\n\nSorry for the ramble, it is purely my opinion, but I feel like it makes sense enough to at least be expressed. Let me know if you disagree and why por favor.",

If you [modify the algorithm to use wavelets instead of waves,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_wavelet_transform) then you're already vaguely most of the way there, since each string is approximately a wavelet. The tricky part is taking advantage of how the wavelets can go in any direction, instead of just horizontally or vertically, and accounting for how it's difficult to really \"weight\" the strings (you could use thicker strings or place more strings in the same place, but that doesn't seem to be what the guy was doing here).\n\nOf course this may not be what the guy did at all. You could probably just throw a least-squares fit at it. But that's pretty boring.",

Lines that cover a lot of originally dark areas will therefore achieve a high fitness. Once the algorithm no longer finds any possible lines the loop is broken and the result can be further processed.\n\nMore translation/tl;dr-ing:  The algorithm averages every pixel in between the current pin and the next pin its looking at.  Then it picks whatever line is darkest.  It also takes into account the lines that have already been laid down.\n\nThis is known as a greedy algorithm- it picks the best thing right now without looking ahead too far.  You can make a better algorithm by looking at all the possible future options.  You just check the next moves at each pin.  Problem is that very quickly becomes very slow.  If there are 100 pins, this greedy version has to check 100 per move.  If it checks one move ahead, it has to check 100 moves for each of *those* moves- 10,000 checks.  Two moves ahead- 1,000,000 checks per move.  You can speed it up using dynamic programming, but that isn't so easy. \n\nOne way to simplify this is to do a [hough transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform) on the image.  This is an algorithm to look for straight lines, one of my favorites.  It's not particularly fast and rarely used in practice because other algorithms are MUCH better, but it can be generalized to find *any* mathematical shape, which is super cool.  [This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Hough-example-result-en.png/1024px-Hough-example-result-en.png) is how the line detection works- those two bright spots are the lines in the image on the left.\n\nIf you do a Hough transform on the image, it gives you a map of all the lines you need to replicate the image.  You could use individual segments to match it perfectly (ish), but if you wanted to use one line you'd still have to do some complicated solving- a variant of [the traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).",

It checks all possible options for the one that would best fit the image. It now draws the optimal line, accounts for the \u201cdarkness\u201d added by this line and starts again.  \nThe algorithm iteratively adds lines to the image until either the maximum number of lines is reached or the stopping criteria is reached. The fitness function is taken to be the specific line integral over the image. Lines that cover a lot of originally dark areas will therefore achieve a high fitness.  Once the algorithm no longer finds any possible lines the loop is broken and the result can be further processed.  \n**TL;DR it picks a random pin, checks all possible lines for the one that fits best, and iterates**",

Please take note of a few things:\n\n- We are **NOT** a \"reaction subreddit\".\n\n- We are **NOT** a subreddit about content that is merely interesting or amazing. \n\n- We are **NOT** interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other general subreddits.\n\n- We are specifically made for **psychedelic content**, trippy or mesmerizing stuff that will make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder!\n\n[Here is the full explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_1_-_woahdude_material_only) of what belongs here. **You'll notice our definition of trippy is more expansive than the obvious fractals and tie-dye concept, but there's a lot we exclude as well.** If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Failure to accept these conditions is grounds for ban. \n\nIf you want examples that exemplify our purpose, check our [WOAHDUDE APPROVED](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/search?q=flair:woahdude&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=new) hall of fame.

The smoothness of the rest of them makes the AT-AT unlikely to be natural. I think it is some smokestacks that are heating the air under the \"leg\" areas. This causes that part to push up a bit higher and when it reaches an equilibrium point it turns into the at-at body. If this is the case it could do that anytime that smooth cloud deck is there and it might not be the same day.",

They were never referred to as \"AT-ATs.\"  I'll bet that the term \"AT-AT\" was made up by someone at Kenner Toys for marketing purposes when they made the toy replica.  Come to think of it, were \"X-wings\" ever called that in any of the movies?  How about \"tie fighters?\"  I know that \"Y-wing\" was never used.  Y-wings don't even have wings at all.  Why would they?  They are space ships, right?  I guess the \"wings\" on the x-wing are just big brackets to mount the laser cannons on.  ...and they open into an \"x\" to give a wider spread of fire...  Ah shit, the cat just knocked over my action figures again!     ",

My third hit was a terrific shock to my senses and perception, the world I saw slowed, like a video game skipping frames, split into repeates hexagons like I was looking out of a fly's eye, and then collapsed into something that was nothing and everything all at once. I briefly panicked before calming myself and recognizing that this was what I came for and it wasn't going to stop so I should just lay back and enjoy it.\n\nAny panic I've had since then is much easier to see past. I've had actual panic attacks where I was able to calm myself and just let it pass. Like the litany against fear from Dune. \n\n*I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.  Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.*",

The compression system makes it so that the video file only has to describe the parts of the video that are changing a lot. Other parts, like the sky, might have pixels that don\u2019t change or maybe the group of pixels looks the same across several frames but just changes where it is on the screen.  All of these provide shortcuts to make the file smaller.  \n\nNow, certain programs can twist these systems, buy telling the video encoder that a section of pixels is changing location on the screen but its color and arrangement remain the same, so you get situations where pixels get \u201cdragged\u201d as the motions of the new video clip push and shift the still image left from the last clip.  The creator of this video is clever to match the placement of objects on screen from one video clip to the nest so the motions of those object seem suddenly weird.",

But I researched it and printed pages of info and explained to my friends that we needed a torch lighter and a low-strength batch to start with, etc. It went pretty ok for most of us. \n\nMy friend\u2019s teenage little sister (we were all teenagers but she was a little younger) said that, for her, everything developed a cartoon-like appearance, and she saw her surroundings start to come apart. The bricks on the patio that she was looking at were floating in a flood from the pool just beyond them, and it was coming for her and going to wash away everything/everyone. She was not exactly happy during it but recovered quickly. \n\nMy own experiences were just depersonalization and everything was reduced to some kind of abstract unsolved mystery and repetitive geometric parts. It was strange but not scary. I did not lose my interest in psychedelics but the whole thing did enforce that preparation and education was key.",

My favorite way is to take fresh leaves and chew them up, allowing the juices to soak into my cheeks, gums and under my tongue(buccal administration) before swallowing the juice and spitting the leaves out. \n\nThis plain leaf form is not concentrated like the extracts are and is much more easier going, it lasts much longer but is not anything as potent and overwhelming as smoking the concentrate. \n\n\nIt\u2019s as if most people who tried weed started with a fat dab of potent wax rather than a hit off a joint.",

The way this translates into the trip/experience is that everything isn\u2019t flying by you at accelerated warpspeed and you are able to absorb more of the trip, which means pulling out more detail and recollection of your experience. \n\nIt\u2019s the difference between a fender bender in a parking lot and a multicar pile up. When you bump someones car its usually a slow process where all the details are easy to recollect but in a big accident with numerous parties involved it is like reciting a play from memory. With the extracts you only remember and focus on important fleeting details but in a smaller accident you are able to replay almost the entire thing from memory.",

I took a large hit and held it in until I started to notice a light coming through the cracks in my friend\u2019s fireplace. I also noticed the vines starting to grow up the sides of the fireplace along the brick wall. Light started to seep through the cracks between the bricks, and it was only then that I remembered I needed to exhale.\n\nAs I breathed out, the wall split apart at the seams into a beautiful jungle scene. I could feel the warm sun on my face, I could hear the birds chirping, and somehow I could see my friend next to me. I couldn\u2019t say anything to her (I had no words to describe what I was seeing at the time) so I just giggled and looked back at her fireplace. About two minutes later, I felt a sharp \u201csplat\u201d as I \u201clanded\u201d back on the beanbag and the fireplace wall quickly closed back up.\n\nI\u2019ve tried many times since, but never made it back to the jungle.",

This is one of the first trials looking into the use of IV ketamine in the *long* long term for **any** reason (Even the trials of using Ketamine for depression/PTSD only lasted a few months MAX, and those where much lower doses, with some given in a nasal spray) I\u2019ve been getting it several times a week for 2 years now and the plan is to continue it for the rest of my life!\n\nBefore this, most trials looking into Ketamine infusions have only been short term, which is why this current trial is on palliative/hospice patients. Any severe side effects that only show up with long term use aren\u2019t going to cost us as much as it would to a healthy person with a normal life expectancy.\n\nSo far, the worst thing has been memory loss. I have a really hard time forming memories and retaining information now. I remember virtually nothing during the infusions and last week\u2019s events might as well have taken place a year ago for all the detail I recall.\n\nHowever, I am *thrilled* to be taking part in something that might be able to help people like me in the future. It\u2019s too late for me to get better, even if we could somehow stop my disease\u2019s progression, I am severely disabled, to the point of being unable to live alone or drive, can no longer eat by mouth, and am in constant severe pain. ***But*** with the data being gain during the trial (my disease\u2019s progression is being assessed constantly to determine the effects of the Ketamine) this might just save someone else a few years down the line. I\u2019m not able to contribute much to society in the traditional sense, but I hope that the constant tests, examinations, and charting will help more be understood about genetic disease like mine in the future.\n\nPlus, getting absolutely ***smashed*** with drugs several times a week is **far** from the worst thing I\u2019ve ever had to do in the name of \u201ctreatment\u201d! \n\n(Sorry, that got REALLY long. I just get really excited talking about it and share whenever I get the chance. Things are looking promising in general, and my case alone has had really positive results.)",

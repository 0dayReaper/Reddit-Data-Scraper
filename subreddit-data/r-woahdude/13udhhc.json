There's a bit of a writeup about it here, discussing the design of the sequence.\n\n[http://www.cinemablography.org/blog/the-art-of-title-design-the-haunting-visuals-of-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-2011](http://www.cinemablography.org/blog/the-art-of-title-design-the-haunting-visuals-of-the-girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo-2011)\n\nFincher's always had a knack for visuals, the title sequences of his films are always unique and memorable in their own way.",

Art and design is somewhat hierarchical with theoretical, conceptual and experimental \"high\" art at the top. (Haute couture literally translates as \"high sewing\"). These are meant as avant garde boundary pushing explorations into wearable forms, from which smaller scale, simpler more conventional work can be inspired and derived from. \n\nYou're never going to have a full scale anish kapoor sculpture in your home, but you may find yourself owning furniture or using architecture influenced by his work. \n\nIt's like that but for clothes.

One cube was moving backwards and right, and we moved left and forward to merge into them. One of the trombones backed into me full force. I couldn't play trumpet for a few days. 2001!\n\nIt was a really difficult move, but then in drum corps we had a single line merge, but at 180 BPM and both lines at my spot were going like 1 step per yard, we got good at jazz running while playing at numerous parts during our show. I remember someone colliding, absolutely crushing their horn while doing a rolling backflip, and recovering barely missing a step. Good thing it was like 75% the way through the show if I recall correctly. 2003 Magic!",

We were playing instruments too, and the lines were definitely cleaner because if they weren't it meant getting your lips smashed in by someone hitting your instrument into your face! I don't think we moved anywhere near this quick though. Maybe half the step size during this drill move. I don't recall the tempo though. I just remember it took us a long time, had a few damaged instruments and people.",

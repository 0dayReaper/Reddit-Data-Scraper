Both can be caused by mirages and Fata Morgana. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Dutchman",

This is not a refraction of light rays through layers of air or a fada morgana as the title says.\n\nThis is a false horizon illusion. Basically there is a line inthe water where it changes color to more closely match the color of the sky. (This can be caused by clouds, or wind patterns) this line is what your eyes incorrectly read as the horizon, causing the actual horizon,  where the ship to appear floating \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=er1mh90wN-k&amp;feature=youtu.be",

All mirages have total internal reflection alongside refraction, so the images are distorted and inverted. In Fata morgana, we have distorted and mirrored images because of uneven temperature distribution. Here we have images of floating ships that are because of incorrect reading of the horizon. Otherwise the water would also be appearing higher up. Looming makes ships or mountains appear higher than they are when they are very close to horizon, and it happens due to refraction only. There is no TIR involved, so the image is not inverted  \n.P.S. all the light puns were intended",

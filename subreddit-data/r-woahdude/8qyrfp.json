Instead of 24 frames per second just take one and leave it open for the full second and you'll capture a lot more light. Do the same for an hour and you have 3600 frames with the same long exposure. Might need to change settings depending on the amount of sunlight and stuff.",

A time lapse is a bunch of photos and these have a slow/low/long (all interchangeable) shutter speed. Shutter speed is how long the shutter mechanism in a camera remains open allowing the sensor or film to be expose and capture the photo. Shutter speeds written like 1/50th, 1/25th, etc etc. as in one 50th or a second. That\u2019s not what this setting would be tho since that\u2019s a fast shutter. \n\nSo it\u2019s not 24 frames per second - it\u2019s just one frame. The frequency which the camera takes each frame for the time lapse is called the interval. ",

I guess you could extrapolate the latitude from the center of rotation of the stars but meh.",

I've been to rural Bolivia, and spent quite a while out in the middle of nowhere, looking at the night sky, so I feel like I'm qualified to talk about this.  The location that I stayed at was several hundred miles from the nearest major settlement, and had absolutely zero light pollution.  I was roughly 16,500 feet up in the Andes Mountain, near the middle of the country.  From where I was, you could see the whole disk of the Milky Way Galaxy wrapping around the sky, with more white than black above you.  It was was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen, and I have absolutely no fucking idea whether or not this was shot in Bolivia.  I'm going back and looking at pictures, and I still have no idea whether or not this was taken in Bolivia.  Like idk man, but there were a hell of a lot of stars.  It was nuts.",

There's a place called the art gallery with aboriginal rock art dating back at least 20,000 years. \n\nIt was such a unique feeling to know I was standing exactly where someone stood that long ago. I thought of what their life might have been like, what the area looked like, what the worked looked like at the time. \n\nKinda scary but mostly exhilarating.",

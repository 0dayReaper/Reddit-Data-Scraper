You're right, it's so common to find bombs and I'll admit it's been years since I blinked at one turning up locally. \n\nUnknowingly lived a few houses down from a \"collector\" of unexploded and found ordnance for a long time. By collector, I mean it turns out he literally found them and took them home. Some came from randoms online who were willing to sell mortars they'd found. Woke up one morning to the street swarming with police and bomb disposal experts, was an interesting day.",

It is often the result of comparing a limited picture of deaths caused by Hitler (6 million Jews, or 12 million non-combatants intentionally exterminated) vs estimates of total deaths caused by Stalin's policies as a whole. If you include the deaths caused by Hitler's invasion of Europe and North Africa, it becomes a number higher than even the more absurd estimates of Stalin's destructive policy.\n\nNot trying to downplay what either of them did, but we have to be mindful that Hitler left well documented records of what he did and we gained access to them immediately. Our estimation of deaths caused by Stalin were made by Western scholars without access to the documentation or direct evidence before the fall of the iron curtain, and at a time when state-sanctioned anti-soviet propaganda was the norm. I'm no scholar of Russia but it seems like newer estimates since 1989 provide a significantly smaller (yet still enormous) number of deaths.",

Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland together in September 1939. It wasn't until 1941 that there was a war between them. Only a few months before the US got into the war actually...\n\nSo in 1940, it was pretty much just the UK against the German warmachine, with scattered resistance groups trying to \"help\".\n\nIt's really interesting to see how effective the German warmachine was and simultaneously ineffective. It was partially that everyone else was more incompetent against them than that Nazi Germany was more effective against everyone else. \n\nAnd a fun fact about Germany conquering France is that Hitler forced the government to sign their surrender in the very same trolley that Germany officially surrendered in in WW1.",

The reason is because their mercenaries were really good and everyone wanted to have them fighting on their side. So they did. 2 sides got their own Swiss soldiers and they fought each other. Quite effectively. \n\nPartially because of that, Switzerland decided to stay neutral in pretty much every conflict since the Napoleonic wars.\n\nAnd boy did they do well. They practically trained the best soldiers to fight defensively in mountains. Probably the toughest terrain to fight against in.  Then we add that Switzerland is mountainous on all sides and has always been known for high quality everything. Especially fluid morals and banking. It's where quite a lot of Nazi wealth was stored, although it's also where almost everyone else stored valuables. \n\nAnd no one wants to invade, because even during WW2, Switzerland could basically cut off the whole country from the world by blowing up bridges. It would simply not have been worth the effort of doing it. And they did kinda sorta support the Nazis, but not exactly from an ideological POV, but from a economical and strategic one. Until it wasn't worth their while anymore. \n\nBut no one conquers Switzerland due to their really good defensive skirmishers. You would lose more men than it would be worth. Probably 3 for every Swiss soldier. And if they had directly aligned with the Nazis, they would have lost business with the Americans and Brits. \n\nSo it wasn't worth taking and they didn't want to align themselves. Instead they were opportunists that were on everyone's side. Not neutral, but not active participants. ",

My walk to work took me down some old streets in London (of which there are many).\n\nAt some point I looked in to the family history, which led to me discovering that my great-great-great-great-whatever grandfather was arrested on a street corner that my walking commute took me over every day. Him being arrested there is what got him sent to Australia, 200+ years ago. He was a teenage pick-pocket.\n\n(We already knew we were from convict stock - that's no big deal. If anything, it's a bit of a point of pride for an Australian.) \n\nIt was interesting to realize that while a lot had changed over that time, he'd probably still be able to recognize that street corner. It felt like I had completed the circle.",

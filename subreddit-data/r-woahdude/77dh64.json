Also if you know you're close to the shore move your hand to feel for the sand so you know where up is because you might not know where \"up\" is if you lose orientation. Waves will generally move you closer to the shoreline. If you get caught in an undertow don't don't fight it. Let it take you out (conserving your energy) and swim parallel to the shore. Flag down a life guard if you can. Stay safe people!",

He'll extend his arm to keep in the barrel until the last moment. 2, that air pocket is surprisingly cushy and blows you to the surface. This would only be dangerous for the professional if he got smacked in the head or back, but hes already through the barrel before the lip even hits the surface.",

And body surfed it when it was smaller. At that size Ke Iki just acts like a huge clamp, it's not like a regular wave and at this size it is usully not rideable. Plus the amount of white water it creates is really hard to swim in. In my opinion it's more dangerous than Waimea shorebreak. Experienced watermen should be fine, but even then the North Shore paralyzes and has killed plenty of experience watermen. There is a reason that when most of the North Shore is pumping that Ke Iki Beach is left alone.\n\nE: and the cameraman is not standing when the waves are that big. ",

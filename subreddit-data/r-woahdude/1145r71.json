Most of the people with decent incomes moved out to the surrounding suburbs or elsewhere in the state/country\n\n3. A feedback loop of the only folks remaining in flint being too poor, desperate, provincial or ignorant to move, resulting in their children growing up even moreso (the worst aspects of each generation get concentrated among their kids' generation, funny how that works).\n\n4. Crime steadily increases in the city well through the late 2000s (the only reason crime statistically fell more recently is that so many folks move out or died from violent crime that the number of potential victims naturally became smaller.) Also, so many houses got arsoned and demolished because of being uninhabitable, so the city became increasingly desolate (causing a decrease in crime as well).\n\nAnd you may have noticed that the *water crisis* hasn't even been factored in yet! That didn't affect things until 2014-2017, but the decades prior have been so horrific for children and families in Flint that a bit of lead in the water is just the cherry on top of the city's Sundae of Misery.\n\n\nDepressing fact about Flint schools: we don't actually have a public high school anymore. There's a charter academy (Southwest) but all the other high schools have closed (and some are being considered for demolition). So few of Flint's children stay in the classroom by high school that it doesn't even make sense for the city to operate a *single high school*.",

These studies involved the injection of foreign, live cancer cells into patients who were hospitalized with various chronic debilitating diseases. Patients were not informed about the injection of cancer cells during the informed consent process, and consent was not documented. The researchers felt that documentation was unnecessary because it was customary to undertake much more dangerous medical procedures without the use of consent forms.\nFurther, patients were intentionally not told that they would receive cancer cells because the researchers felt it would unnecessarily frighten them. Researchers asserted that they had good cause to predict that the cancer cells were going to be rejected.\nIn subsequent review proceedings conducted by the Board of Regents of the State University of New York, it was found that the study had not been presented to the hospital\u2019s research committee and that the physicians responsible for the patients\u2019 care had not been consulted. The researchers were found guilty of fraud, deceit, and unprofessional conduct.\n\n\nOf course there\u2019s the St. Louis experiments. The radiation experiments on soldiers. The experiments with cancer done on Puerto Rican citizens by doctor that was praised by the medical community. The list is indeed very long.",

That was a rhetorical question dummy, and the answer is no. Now please sign our petition to prevent Federal Investigators from accessing the disaster, er\u2026 I mean benefit site, as it would hurt our feelings. Don\u2019t you trust us?",

Also, separating the adjectives with commas isn't really necessary\n\nEdit: Now I have to argue the Uncle Jack thing. \"I need to help my Uncle Jack, off a horse.\" is grammatically incorrect. \"I need to help my Uncle Jack off a horse\" means you're helping your uncle kill a horse. \"I need to help my Uncle Jack get/jump/climb off a horse.\" is what you're looking for. \"Off\" in this context is a preposition that should be attached to a verb, as it indicates movement. It's about capitalization and connotation, really, not comma usage. That's all for my Ted Talk.",

But those that are bad at it usually offset it with better eye tracking.\n\nBirds most notably can keep their heads perfectly stationary no matter how their bodies move.  Which is especially important for birds that bob their heads back and forth when they walk.  They do that because they have stationary eyeballs, so they need to keep their head stationary momentarily while walking to be able to see properly.\n\nCats are very good at it as well.  In usual cat fashion, they have both great head and eye stabilization.  Being overpowered hunters as usual.\n\nDogs and especially us, due to our top mounted heads, don't have very good head stabilization, but since, as predators, we have eyes on the front of our heads, we can compensate for that with great eye stabilization.",

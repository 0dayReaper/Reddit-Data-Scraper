It's a relatively new genre and the artists are essentially exclusive to soundcloud and youtube so the genre itself isn't super refined to the point that everyone can agree on how they would classify themselves and others into subgenres. Your best bet is to just dig. Comb through a few playlists on youtube and see if the artists are credited. Find the artists on soundcloud and make a playlist yourself. You may have luck just letting soundcloud recommend songs based on the playlist as well. Good luck! Sorry it's not easier to find that particular sound you're looking for.",

I won't even go into ethics of art production here since I think all of our tools are somewhat born out of exploitation at mass scale anyway, but point being you can't make anything except maybe cave wall art with charcoal without someone else's input and legacy. This is just a different way of doing that. Photoshop was created by someone, Blender was created by someone, all of the things you come up with are there because of someone else.",

The foundation of your argument is severely flawed at best, and at worst you\u2019re not actually familiar with how the renders generated from text input are made. There is no creativity in this, and the outputs are entirely created from work found online and fed to the model. To equate the human labor of mixing compounds to achieve a specific color which is then sold for a profit to something like DALL-E is just outlandish.",

I said I didn't want to make that the main point of my reply, but here we go I guess. I think it is funny to think that most things that we use in our daily lives, without a hitch of our conscience more than every once in a while, would be any more ethical than these models. I don't see any reason to start feeling moral pangs over this than the use of my smartphone, which I deem valuable enough to justify the exploitation that \"\"\"\"\"inevitably\"\"\"\"\" goes into its production. Arguably in a much more tangible manner. Well, maybe you're a saint in your life. I don't know. I'm not, not in use of AI models nor clothes, food, electronics or personal gas powered vehicle. Nor so many other things. It is my way of being in the world, I use things that are born out of exploitation for my own enjoyment sometimes. I bet 99% of us do. Unethical? Yeah sure. Inconsistent? I don't think so. I think I do so many things way more unethical than this without even noticing.\n\nThe question of creativity in this? Well... I'm not going to get through to you, because the reality of it is inconceivable to you. I don't see shaping the parameters of a complicated string of images to be created with Stable Diffusion to form an animation with a specific look any different than making a 3d model in Blender. Just the method of inputting data is different, but workflow is very similar in terms of trial and error, adjustment and such. \n\nTake a look at this video and the making of video and say there was no creativity in it. And yes, less complex things than this are still creative, even if there was no real life footage included, in my opinion.\nhttps://youtu.be/GVT3WUa-48Y\n\n\nEdit: btw, I am a creative for 15 years already, and I've done everything from video and music to writing different styles. Once you discover the depth of some of these tools, you can spend thousands of hours learning. That is not a joke. But, maybe you will use the strategy of invalidating my experience of creativity by making me incapable of understanding it as an experience or concept, in your head. Everyone who doesn't agree with my idea of creativity is living an illusion. The DALL-E example is just kind of bad faith, because it's literally the most surface level of these tools. It's the microsoft photo viewer compared to Photoshop and Blender. There are REMARKABLY complex implementations of these AI tools out there, which nobody really knows how to use yet.",

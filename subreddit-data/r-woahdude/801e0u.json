If they really wanted to show how the lines can add depth, they should be applied to a gif without other affects. If you take away the lines in this GIF, it still has depth. ",

The lines appear to be the top layer of the image as they are unaffected by the adjusting of the focus, and I think it's fair to say that they *are* an overlay on the GIF.  \n\nHowever, the lines have been edited such that they are removed from the GIF at precisely the points where the swinging bat crosses them, giving the bat the illusion that it is not only passing in front of the swinger (heh) but over the white lines and past surface of the image itself.  \n\nThe heavy narrowing of the depth of field is intended to heighten the effect, though whether it accomplishes this I cannot say as I've not personally seen this effect employed before.  The white lines are not, however, entirely unnecessary here.",

You might still be able to gauge depth from other visual cues, but you're definitely lacking in depth perception.\n\nTry looking at various objects and poking them with one finger, starting with one eye closed and then both open. I can definitely see a difference.",

Move them apart about 1cm and move one toward you 1cm. With one eye closed you will not be able to tell which one is closer as long as there are no other cues like paralax or focus.

Closing one eye is not a very good demonstration of what it means to have no stereoscopic depth perception.\n\nIt's because you're still see the shapes, lengths, and lines. And you're already familiar with where they are in relation to each other and what size they are.\n\nDepth perception is taking an object, comparing how the left eye sees it and how the right eye sees it, and noticing how much of the object is shown differently to each eye to get an idea for how close or far away it is. If an object is similar to both eyes, it's farther away. If the object is more different across both eyes, it is closer.\n\nWith a single eye, you can still see how close or far something is because the thing gets bigger if it's moving closer to you. You can also still compare relative sizes and locations of objects in what you're seeing.\n\n",

It doesn't change how the object looks with one eye, it means you don't have the two reference points measuring distance to the object. \n\nMaybe not a good example, but it's similar to how knowing the length of two sides of a triangle lets you deduce the length of the third. If you're an astronomer you need to take the measurement of a star once and then six months later take it again (when the earth is nearly 200 million miles from its previous spot) to judge how far the star is. Right... this was a tangent, but basically you need two eyes for depth perception otherwise you're just guessing how far the object is.",

LOL...\n\nIf you live with depth perception and cover an eye for a minute or two you'll probably notice no difference.\n\nEven stereo blind people can use parallax and other environmental cues to come up with something that is almost depth perception, but not quite.  People with stereo vision have had years to train their brains about all the cues and taking some away doesn't instantly result in lack of depth perception because our brains are good at \"filling in the blanks.\"\n\nStereo sighted people are better at filling those blanks in because they have more of a vocabulary with which to fill them.\n\n\nI hope that made any sense...

This is because my right eye has _terrible_ eyesight. Like, you know when you focus an object in front of you, but you can sort of still \"see\" what around you, in you peripheral vision, but it's all blurry and whatnot. Mute the colors and light a bit, add some distortion and that's what my right eye sees. I can't read anything with it unless it's billboard sized. So, according to a doctor, my brain has just mostly eliminated the input from that eye and uses it as \"extra\" peripheral vision. \n\nI can live a normal life like this, but those tricks that go around designed to test you depth perception don't work with me. Like, there's this one where you hold both your index fingers, pointed at each other, close one eye, and try to touch them. Most people seem fail this but I have no problem. Another thing is those \"magic eye\" images, where you have to focus them a certain way and you kinda see a hidden 3d looking image. Never worked for me.\n\nI guess I manage depth perception using other visual cues, and my brain has adapted to it. Relative size of objects, whether they're focused, etc",

As a consequence of this, my right eye has atrophied over the years leaving me with terrible vision in that eye. Depth perception is an effect of both eyes focusing on a single point from different angles. Since my eyes can't do that I don't see any real depth to the world. There are of course other clues my brain has learned to pick up on since I've seen this way most of my life, but things like catching a ball are incredibly difficult for me.

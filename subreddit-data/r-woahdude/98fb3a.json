A good photo is a combination of many multiple aspects of a camera.\n\nYou could cram as many trillions of pixels into a camera as you wanted, but if your lens or sensor wasn't equally \"good\" you'd just end up with trillions of poor quality dots of light. \n\nCamera phone companies advertise crazy high megapixels because, compared to sensors and lenses, those are much cheaper to improve.\n\nWhile more pixels may mean a better shot, it's one part of a multifaceted input that hasn't even begun to discuss what all effects the actual exposure of an image on top of that.",

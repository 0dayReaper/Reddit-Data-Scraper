It's so insanely powerful that now people sell / buy prompts on a market in order to get their renderings just right.\n\nObviously if the tooling was better, you'd be able to navigate styles using a more intuitive UI. It turns out communicating the specifics of cinematography are hard for a layperson to figure out.\n\nAnyways, you could probably run these images through YET ANOTHER AI program to then generate the 3D models...

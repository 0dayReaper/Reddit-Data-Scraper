While she can sometimes acquire new forms, Paige most commonly takes on a Paige-like form in a new material. She can become any solid that she has studied (including\u00a0glass, wood,\u00a0rubber,\u00a0brick,\u00a0diamond, granite, and even\u00a0adamantium). These forms take on new physical abilities or qualities appropriate to the form, such as increased weight, strength, or invulnerability. Paige has shown some ability to take on forms with energy powers - including a fiery form that generates heat and flame, and a form with acidic skin.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husk_(comics)",

I felt like the audio choices and implementation actually pulled me *out* of and distracted from a lot of the presentation due to it feeling inaccurate to the visual timing of materal moving and colliding off the back where applicable. \n\nAn example is how in some modes, there's only material sound to the actual footsteps, but not the other body movements or friction. While in other modes, you hear a lot of non-step motion that then doesn't sync with the legs or arms moving, and/or the footsteps don't sound like the material *\"ought to.\"*\n\nAll in all though, awesome.

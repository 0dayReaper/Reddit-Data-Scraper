That is just CGI dress-up.\n\nWhat they are actually doing is mounting the camera on a rail system and pushing it forward and through the objects/spaces with the long lens attached. So that's where you're seeing it travel through things.\n\nFor instance, this shot of the inside of the bottle:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/MN5V3h1.jpg\n\nIs actually filmed like this:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/MNUgELP.png\n\nBut probably with a rail system, rather than a guy holding it, to keep the camera perfectly flat as it travels through.",

The reason they use plants and chip bags in this video is because they're extremely sensitive to vibrations like this.  You couldn't generate those results with, say, a video of a book.  Also, the high speed cameras are a) very expensive and b) require a whole bunch of light to work, so they aren't a good solution, and using regular consumer cameras results in human voices so distorted you might as well be listening for secret messages by playing the White Album backwards.",

I also thought the bullet deflected off the mirror and into the coffee. I also thought at the end, hmm, what if they installed these tiny camera bullets in seal sniper bullets so you could get a cool looking animation of someone getting killed. If the truth in the comments here wasn't here I have continued to think that it was a bullet camera ",

Firstly, how would it have kept aligned towards the coffee? And how would it have gone perfectly straight when the mirror stand wasn\u2019t even slightly rigid?

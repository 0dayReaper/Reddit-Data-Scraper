    "postText": "Hi I'm Sukhjit\nAs an artist and designer, my mission is to raise awareness about the vastness of our universe. Too many people pass away without realizing that Earth is just a tiny fraction of the cosmos. My aim is to start conversations about celestial objects, just like we talk about the weather. \n\nEver since I was a child, I have been enchanted by the idea of floating in space and gazing at the moon. This dream has never left me, and is reflected in my artwork, My Space Mirror. \n\nThis piece is a tangible representation of my childhood dream, showcasing intricate details of the moon's craters and mountains. The moon's depiction on the mirror is like a portal to the celestial realm. Despite being hundreds of thousands of miles away, the moon remains the closest connection we have to the rest of the universe, and My Space Mirror brings me a sense of unity with the cosmos.",

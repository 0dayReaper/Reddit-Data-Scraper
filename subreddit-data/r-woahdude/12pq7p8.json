I'm a musician by trade and I've often wondered how far we are from being able to hum or sing into a microphone, mimicing a song we want and have it produce something for us. This is effectively that for visual art. IMHO we're going to see a new take on visual art altogether, akin to how photography demanded a new approach to traditional fine arts. It's exciting and terrifying all at once.",

It's an expression of our creativity and the time we spend doing the things we love. \n\nYou can buy a sweater or knit it yourself. You can buy a tomato or start a garden and grow some yourself. You can go to Google images, or you can make what you want to see yourself. \n\nIn all of these cases, it's not so important that your thing be the same as or better than the \"store-bought\" version. The real value is the time you spend tending to that garden after a long day, knitting while listening to your favorite song, or following your brush and watching a painting come alive. _That's_ art.\n\nPeople said machines can't replace us because they can't make art; now they can. People say they can't replace us because they can't experience art like we do; that may not be true much longer. But even so, our art is special to us because it's _ours_, and making those things (hopefully) enriched our lives in the process.",

There's an empty spot I think I assigned to the soul of the artist (wrought by work and experience) which opens up when I look at a photo, say, which turns out to be created from just a human idea, rather than a visceral experience to which I can relate. It's in the same ballpark as the little chuckle you do when you see in the opening credit of a movie: \"Based on an idea by ...\" like yeah, pal, we've all had ideas. This should really say: \"Based on a guy who was in the right Hollywood meeting at the right time with the right lawyer.\"",

You buy art from an artist you like, because of what they've made before, or because they've sold work before etc. Machine learning generated images don't have any of that. \n\n\nTo me this comes down to redefining what it means to be an artist as opposed to being an illustrator. One works with deeper creative concept, the other with skill. And I'm sure people will still want to buy things that either of these groups will make, as having something that someone made with their hands gives you a connection to that person.",

Many more work for companies doing design, concept art, 3D, etc. and those companies don't necessarily care about who does that work. If the results are satisfactory, then it's about the price and speed of the process, and that's where AI is (or seems to become in the near future) unparalelled.",

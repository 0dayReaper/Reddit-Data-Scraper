An unwilling creature can make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to resist being transported.\n\n####Actions\n___\n\n***Multiattack.*** The projection makes two twilight strike attacks.\n\n***Twilight Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 9 (2d8) psychic damage, can't take reactions until the end of its next turn, and can take either an action or a bonus action on its next turn, not both. On a successful save, the target takes half as much psychic damage and does not have its actions restricted.\n\n***Zone of Twilight (Recharges After a Short or Long Rest).*** The projection infuses the surrounding space in a 30-foot radius with the atmosphere and energies of the twillight realm of the Feywild to create a bubble of distorted space centered on itself. The space fogs and muddles the minds of non-fey, making it difficult to focus. The area lasts for 10 minutes, or until the projection's concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).  \n&amp;nbsp; For as long as the bubble remains, the entire space within it is considered difficult terrain for all non-fey creatures, and any non-fey creature's movement speeds, as well as its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are halved (minimum 1) for as long as the creature remains within the area. A creature that enters the area for the first time on its turn, or that starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn, and can take only either an action or bonus action for the rest of this turn, not both.\n\n####Reactions\n___\n\n***Destabilize.*** When a creature the projection can see moves to within that creature's reach of the projection, the projection destabilizes itself, causing its appearance to become wavy and ethereal. Until the end of the current turn, attack rolls against the projection have disadvantage, and when a creature misses with such an attack roll, the projection can immediately move up to 5 feet, not provoking opportunity attacks.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Edit: Fixed a copy-paste mistake. Fixed a portion that was cut off. Adjusted CR to more accurate representation.*",

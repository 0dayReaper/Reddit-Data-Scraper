How it works - There are two balancing forces between any act, the forward pushing force created by the purpose of why you\u2019re doing it and the repelling force created by fear (or failure/rejection/lack of self worth)\n\n2. Causes - At times the repulsive forces outweigh the forward pushing forces and that creates procrastination (sometimes it\u2019s subversive, eg you suddenly find yourself cleaning your room rather than doing those things you should do)\n\n3. Habits - If you don\u2019t address the underlying issues, eg your self worth by identifying your triggers and the harsh words you use on yourself, the unrealistic expectations you have etc etc, it becomes a habit. Habits are fuckers to live with but they can be broken\n\n4. Overcoming it - We can do several things to help, make the task smaller, ie don\u2019t make yourself paint for 1 hour, just do 1 stroke. Start addressing the underlying fears and get connected to your why... why tf do you want to do this?\n\n5. Determination - it\u2019s about having a good reason to push though pain. I paint space because 99% of people in the USA and Europe live under light polluted skies... most people can see less than 2% of the visible night skies.\n\n\u2014Most kids growing up today will live and die and will have never seen the stars at night\n\n\u201cWhen your why is big enough, you will find your how\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I numbered these but anyway, I hope in some small way this helps xx",

I do abstract paintings and infuse graf style lines into basically freestyles pieces some futurism influences, and some calligraphy tools get used but not for actual letter manipulation. Some of it is planned but most of it is off the cuff. Glow in the dark nebulas as the background to my work would be a dope incorporation. Never thought of glow in the dark modge podge style. I really love pieces like this. I call my style mechanical graffstract. But yeah anyways. Each piece and stroke is always practice at cleaner lines, better layering, color blending or color thinning. Sick piece dude, plus the woman on the side of the piece is extremely easy on the eyes so keep painting! ;)",

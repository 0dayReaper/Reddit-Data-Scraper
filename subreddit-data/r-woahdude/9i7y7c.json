Please take note of a few things:\n\n- We are **NOT** a \"reaction subreddit\".\n\n- We are **NOT** a subreddit about content that is merely interesting or amazing. \n\n- We are **NOT** interchangeable with /r/pics, /r/gifs, /r/damnthatsinteresting or other general subreddits.\n\n- We are specifically made for **psychedelic content**, trippy or mesmerizing stuff that will make a sober person feel stoned, or stoned person trip harder!\n\n[Here is the full explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/wiki/index#wiki_rule_0_-_woahdude_material_only) of what belongs here. You'll notice our definition of trippy is more expansive than the obvious fractals and tie-dye concept, but there's a lot we exclude as well. If you post content that doesn't meet those criteria, it will be removed. Failure to accept these conditions is grounds for ban. \n\nIf you want examples that exemplify our purpose, check our [WOAHDUDE APPROVED](https://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/search?q=flair:woahdude&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=new) hall of fame.

It will be more of a niche hobby activity done for fun in private.  I would miss driving in some ways if we went full autonomous vehicles, but it would be worth it for all the other benefits.  I imagine there were people who felt the same way when cars were taking over who missed a nice quiet horse ride into town.\n\nThere will still be motorsports there for the people that care, but over the generations I\u2019d imagine they\u2019d decline in popularity and become something catered more towards wealthier people, similar to horse racing/shows/breeding/owning now.  When something isn\u2019t a necessary part of everyday life, fewer people are likely to become interested in it and it will get more expensive.",

Accidents will still happen, and I highly doubt any current DOT safety standards will be removed, if anything more will be added because people will be sitting in different orientations, lying down, etc...\n\nWhen, not if, an autonomous car gets into an accident, that will cost the manufacturing company probably between 2 and 10 million dollars *per death*, possibly more with inflation. And that doesn't include any injury settlements, which depending on how bad they are, could be between 30,000-5,000,000 (5,000,000 being for severe, barely alive, no quality of life). The cost of adding safety features to cars would be cheaper than that considering airbags and seat belts cost maybe a few grand total at most.",

It was safer that way. Your sharing the roads with Mercedes, busses, duct taped mopeds full of grain that can\u2019t steer for shit. At first I was like \u201cno way\u201d but after 10 minutes of riding you definitely understand the kind of \u201cpulse\u201d traffic has and your a little red blood cell moving through it all not crashing. It was exhilarating and you could get anywhere in the city so FAST that way. I miss it now. I think it\u2019s more dangerous biking in my upper-middle class suburb and certainly way less fun. ",

It'll often result in a pretty bad gridlock, which is why busy intersections in wealth countries always have some sort of traffic control.\n\nEven if this was produced by a film studio with a large budget and highly trained stunt drivers and stunt actors, (thus explaining the copies of like 3 car models,) the amount of coordination required for something like this would be insane. Even the slightest screwup in timing or positioning would've meant, not only a failed stunt, but thousands of dollars in damages that would need to be repaired before the next take and potentially hefty medical bills if the pedestrian actors were hit.\n\nA composite would be cheaper, safer, and easier. I don't think that someone would coordinate this for a feature film, let alone some random youtube video.",

Think of a meme generator app vs photoshop.\n\nWhen that happens? Politics is going to get REAL interesting.

They put him in the movie anyway, using a different actor wearing prosthetics.

I have an ancient Youtube channel that up until I figured out I can upload anonymously to Streamable without an account a few years ago I would make videos and upload them to Youtube for shitposting purposes. \n\nThe other day I got drunk and wondered if my stupid Youtube shit ever racked up any views, and I realized that like half a dozen had been marked as copyright claimed. I have never monitized a video in my life, and would have to Google it to even know how. \n\nSo I guess my rambling of a question is: What's the point of copyright claiming non-monetized videos that have less than 5k views and are like 5-10 years old? I don't care about the videos, I'm sure they're right in doing it as....well it was for shitposting and I didn't care about rules, but what's the point?",

I realize this technology is probably already used in film/tv production but like, how widespread is its use and for what legitimate purposes? And could I have seen a deep fake irl, completely unaware I was watching a deep fake? \n\nThis ones different because A you\u2019ve already told us, and B I know Tom Cruise is looks older and his voice sounds like a much younger version of himself compared to now, but I don\u2019t know if I would have caught those things upon first glance without any prior knowledge of this being a deep fake. Idk this just makes me uncomfortable",

It\u2019s all about getting the data sets that contain the trained AI. That can be tricky. Training your own can take a long time. The ones you can just download are good but to get a dee fake this clean you need one trained to just this one person. Think of what\u2019s available online being more of a generalist AI but the one being used here is a specialist.\n\nSo there is a considerable effort involved. Enough that most people will not be able to do anything like this.... for now.\n\nAI is advancing fast. 10 years ago it was almost a pipe dream. 10 years from now it will influence every second of our lifes. And reality. It may sound scary but manipulation like this has been done for decades. It just used to be more manual work rather than a machine doing it all automated.\n\nIf it scare you then you need to learn about it, get interested in it, try to understand it. Don\u2019t become like your parents generation who completely ignored the rise of personal computers and the internet and who now rage over having lost their voice in a world they don\u2019t understand.\n\nBe interested, keep learning, embrace the future, don\u2019t hang on to old things.",

The reason it works so well with Tom Cruise's face, is because there is source material of Tom Cruise's face from pretty much every angle in pretty much every lighting scenario. And lots of it. \n\nBasically, what's going on here, is some computer algorithm is able to look at a video, determine where a face is, and swap in another face. It looks pretty damn convincing if there's enough source material of the face.",

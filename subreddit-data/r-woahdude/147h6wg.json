Dad worked for IBM at the time. \n\nI was 6-9 yrs old. Incredible city.  Beautiful culture. I remember the amazing street festivals and the kindness elderly people showed me as a cute little gaijin.   The shops and markets were so cool.  Everything was cute and high quality. Even benign things like staplers. Subway travel was intense but safe.  At that age my parents actually let us take the subway to our gymnastics lessons all by ourselves.    Nintendo Famicom and Super Mario Bros came out while I was there. I remember watching the challenger space shuttle explode on live TV.  I remember having a sink in our bathroom that had no handle, it only ran water when the toilet was flushed.   I remember flying kites with my dad and taking calligraphy lessons from my 85 year old Japanese neighbour. \n\nGreat memories. I\u2019m all grown up now and would love to take my kids on a trip there some day.   Highly recommend this beautiful city to everyone.\n\nEdit:\nSomeone asked me if I could see my old house. It was in 4-Chome Meguro Ku. Pretty sure that\u2019s about right here - any locals that can verify?\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/mOT98jA.jpg\n\nI also included a pic of me flying the (at the time) longest string of kites in the world \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Lc5IDMJ.jpeg\n\nOne more pic of the 8-yr old me photobombing at the cherry blossom festival \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/AYJwuTk.jpeg",

I was very untrained and (so) I suffered from altitude sickness. It was rough. I was at the top for about 10 minutes and rushed to go down, because I felt so ill. I had a bunch of friends who enjoyed it, though.\n\nLesson to be learned: be at least a normal amount of fit before you climb a 3.7km high mountain. Or climb slower, so you can acclimate better to the amount of oxygen in the air.\n\nEDIT: Beijing was a guess, btw. I had no actual reason to think it was Beijing. I was thinking of big cities and that was the one I came up with.",

There's nothing there at all, except there is. This piece is WAY out of the ordinary for me. It's controlled sloppiness. Most of my work is drawn freehand using fine tipped art pens and is intricately detailed. Painting is good and I enjoy it, but it's definitely not my favorite style/medium. That's cool your friend used to create similar art and with black ink too.",

They thought they were driving slow until a truck driver knocked on their window asking if they were ok.  It completely shocked them because with the vertigo they thought they were actually moving.  the trucker had them follow his hazard lights until the next rest stop.\n\nEdit: Didn't expect this to blow up... but to address the most common responses to all the people saying: \"They didn't have speedometers back then?\"  Yes, yes they did. Cars also had brakes before the last decade which didn't prevent a rash of elderly people from driving through multiple farmers markets. What can I say... seniors aren't known for their quick thinking.  And if you've ever driven through the mountains of Colorado (I don't actually know where they were driving, but I was born there so quite possible) then you know the feeling of going downhill while riding the brakes to avoid building up speed. Your foot doesn't touch the gas for a long while... (of course you should be driving in a lower gear instead)  My guess is something like that where they thought they were 'coasting' without a foot on the gas.. anyway.. they died many years ago so unfortunately I can't ask for more details. I just remember my grandmothers reaction as she relived it, wile my grandfather retold the story.  (she was much like Dana Carvey as the 'Church lady' on SNL..)",

I work and live in London but made the decision to nope out, leave work early and stay at a friends place in Kent just because I knew I could most likely make it to there quicker, and I did (even if it did take double the time, only getting a train half way, then a bus, then walking). If I'd gotten my usual train home I would've been one of those insanely unlucky commuters who got stuck on the toiletless trains for hours, well into the night / early hours. \n\nI know it doesn't make sense for the UK to spend so much on being prepared when a 'big' storm happens because it does so rarely, but that was pretty brutal.",

I was stood at a bus stop watching people in their office attire trying to speedwalk across a puddle of black ice with inevitably dire consequences. Absurd. \n\nThe individual people might not know much about snow and ice but the city surely does, and it did nowt to warn commuters and so on to take basic precautions.",

They're usually pretty good about closing the lifts if the weather starts getting hairy, but it's totally possible to be already on the lift and the last one off before they call it.",

                    "comment": "When I\u2019ve been in this situation in the past it was when working mines/exploration sites in the arctic. So only loosely relatable, but this is how we would deal with a zeroViz storm like that, which was very common occurrence.\n\nIt\u2019s a trade off, no public roads or civilians to worry about, but were also a 1 hour flight off an ice runway (if the planes can fly) or a 12 hour drive down the ice road away from civilization (if the road is open.) So to say safety is number one when there\u2019s only two paramedics on a site with 50-100 people, is an understatement.\n\nFirst thing to know, your shift-start toolbox meeting always has a weather report which is usually a print out of the same GFA 0, +6, and +12 hour forecast from Nav Canada that the pilots use to determine their flight status. (There is no better weather report for the arctic region. That and yr.no because the Norwegians know wtf is up.)\n\n So before you even sign the toolbox meeting form, everyone knows a storm is coming if it\u2019s even likely.  When we head out in a day like that we are expecting to hear a \u201chold in place\u201d order at some point.\n\nOnce you\u2019re in the truck and seeing what you see in OP\u2019s vid you\u2019ll either be the one calling dispatch over the repeater to let them know you\u2019ve found the storm, or you\u2019ll receive the hold in place order over the radio. Once that order is given everyone takes turns on the dispatch channel to give an update of their location and who\u2019s in the vehicle/building while dispatch will update the \u201cpinout\u201d map to know exactly where everyone is. They already have a good pin out of where ppl are supposed to be, this is just confirming.\n\nIf you try to move without express instructions while the hold in place is active you will never work on that site again, and maybe some other sites if your maneuver was dumb enough.\n\nAt that point you just wait and stay warm. Keep the truck/equipment running at all costs. Also why anyone who forgets to fully refill their machine or truck at the start of the shift can be blacklisted from the site forever. It\u2019s your life at risk if you forget to refuel and run out of diesel on hour 6 of a crazy day long storm.\n\nThat\u2019s it. You literally just sit there and wait for hours at a time until the visibility returns enough across the site to remove the hold in place order and resume work. In that time you\u2019ll be asked for regular checkins over the radio. There are some other minor SOP details that are important that I\u2019ve left out for time, but that\u2019s basically all the rank and file deal with.\n\nIf you\u2019re in ops you spend the whole time on the GPS/sat phone with air charters/town-side logistics getting flights ready to swoop in after the storm if there was a serious incident. That side of things is sweaty because you\u2019re literally preparing for the worst, but it\u2019s mundane also. \n\nIf there is a situation during the hold like someone injured or a truck almost out of fuel dispatch will send either a crew in a snowcat or a Hagglund to go and assist. They are usually lead by the most experienced ice road building foreman on site and they\u2019ll nav by GPS to follow the road to get to the person in distress. It\u2019s extremely dangerous, even in an amphibious vehicle, so this action would be considered a \u201cnear miss\u201d and the person who ran out of fuel is probably fired.\n\nI was on a site once where two drillers had to be rescued from a drill shack by a Hagglund on the 26th hour of a hold order that lasted 34 hours total. That storm was Beaufort scale 11 for almost 30 of those hours, scale12 for a couple hours in the middle.\n\nThe wind was so bad it blew the roof off the drill shack and snuffed out their diesel drip stove. They huddled up under their emergency blankets and piled a bunch of hoses and shit on top of them to try and hide from the storm. Their radio antenna snapped off and after they went unheard from on the next radio check in the team was sent to them.\n\nBoth survived, with some cold injuries each. The only reason they survived was because of the strict SOPs that got a crew to them within an hour of them missing a radio check. SOPs that are written in the blood of the people who didn\u2019t survive the previous SOPs.\n\nSo, that\u2019s how we deal with it in a \u201cprofessional\u201d working environment. Literally stop moving until otherwise instructed.\n\nThe best thing you can do in this situation as a civilian driving on public roads is to look at a weather report before you leave the house and then make the smart call to stay at home instead.\n\nOnce you\u2019re in that situation you\u2019re already fucked and it\u2019s only a matter of luck if you get out safety.",

There's snow on the road, there's snow on the side of the road, there's snow in the ditch that's piled up and even with the road.  On a 2 lane highway, people may be driving in the middle of the road, so what may \"feel\" like you're off the road is just you going fully into your lane. 99% of the time there will not be light poles on the side of the road if the conditions get to this extent - you're in the wide open. You can maybe find electrical poles, but there's a chance you can't even see them, they may take off in another direction, or you're so focused on the road the last thing you want to do is be trying to find them. Plus, there can be car sized snow drifts in the road, so focusing on the road is far more important than trying to locate things off the road. You can sometimes see the mile markers on the side of the interstate, so those are about the best reference points to look for without making things worse.  \nSlow WAY down. Put your 4 ways on so you're more visible (some people are against this, saying it should only be for stopped cars... Whatever. I'm making myself as visible as possible, because thinking someone is going to slam into you causes nerves just as bad as trying to find the road). Turning your brights on can make it worse - the light shines off the snow back to you, but fog lights may help a bit. If you can get in a line of people, you can just keep slowly trucking along, but stay far from the car in front of you. Black ice is the worst kind of asshole, and you don't want to slide into the car in front of you. Also, that person may think they're driving on the road, but they're heading into the ditch. Stay back so you have time to correct and not follow them in. DO NOT FUCKING PASS. Again, black ice is an asshole. I've seen cars slide into a car they're trying to pass. Also, it can create even worse white-out situations from the snow you kick up for the people you're passing. You think you're safe because of your truck? Those can get tossed around more in the wind with icy situations. I've passed numerous semis taking a little ditch nap because they blew over. Also, if you end up behind a semi that starts tipping up because of the wind, stay WAY back. They usually don't just tip over out of nowhere. They'll be blown around before that happens, sometimes having back wheels come off the ground, slam back down, causing them to swerve. Run awaaaaayyyyyyyyy!!",

He had a Geo Metro and the wind was buffeting his tiny car around and the visibility was awful. He pulled to the side, but the shoulder was super narrow, so he ended up sliding into the ditch. He called my mom to let her know that he was stuck. As he was on the phone with Mom describing where he\u2019d slid off, they heard a semi\u2019s horn blaring as it had slid out and was drifting sideways downhill on the highway that my father had just been on. That semi slid into 3 cars on its drift. So yeah, it sucked that he had to get towed back onto the highway out of the ditch, at least he was safe and still had a functional car. \n\nAlso, my parents always keeps emergency blankets, those hand warmer packs, and food and water in the car because they live in a region with Lake Effect snow.",

But I\u2019m driving for no less than a few minutes, home is only 10-15 minutes away. It starts POURING down raining. Like POURING. The streets were flooding because it had been raining earlier that day. I couldn\u2019t see anything at all. I have anxiety so I panic very quickly and quite literally froze up at the wheel because I felt as though I was blind. I couldn\u2019t focus on anything but the wall of gray I could see all around me and my fianc\u00e9 had to turn on my hazards for me and talked me through driving slowly until we got to a gas station where we could switch. We passed so many car accidents that day and almost hit so many cars because he was too stubborn to just sit down at the gas station and wait for the storm to pass.\n\nAnd then the sun had the AUDACITY to reappear the minute we hit our home street and I was just so upset.",

It depends on where you are and where you are going. \n\nIf you are going away from civilization, on your way up a mountain pass or an unknown potentially dangerous area you turn around and try to inch your way to safety.   \n\nIf you are going down, or towards civilization you try to keep going.  \n\nThe road markers in snowy countries usually have high vis plastic poles evert few hundred meters. You try to look for them, where the poles are on your right, with the reflective stripes down towards you. //   \n\nYou drive as slowly as possible while you still have traction and clearance.\n\nIf you are unable to get to safety you stop and wait in the car. Conserve fuel, don't run the motor the whole time to keep the lights and heat on, that should be reserved for emergency. Also because in rare cases the car might fill with carbon monoxide and you fall asleep never to wake up.   \nYou  put on all the clothes you have, put on a blanket or anything. Start the car periodically if it gets really cold but the good thing about blizzards is that because of the fast moving wind they are not very cold. If you are dry you will be OK. Never, EVER leave the car for help, that's how people die.  \n\nDriving inside a glass of milk can be terrifying but you get used to it.",

If there's no ice, but quickly accumulating deep snow, you'll probably want to be going faster at around 30mph to ensure you don't get stuck, especially if you're driving a 2-wheel drive car.\n\nHonestly it's really all about paying attention to how your car feels in the snow. Here are some examples:\n\nIs it skidding? time to slow down. Lightly ease your foot off the gas. DO NOT slam on your brakes under any circumstances. \n\nIs the car drifting left/right? time to slow down, and/or be more mindful about staying in the tracks on the road if there are any. Again, don't slam on your brakes, you can either take your foot off the gas or lightly tap your brakes. \n\nDo I feel resistance and like the car is slowing down on its own? time to *lightly* speed up to power through the accumulating snow. Emphasis on lightly. If you gas it too hard you will either dig in your tires or go skidding off the road.\n\nHope this helps! Grew up in a rural area of a very snowy part of the North East.",

If you leave your vehicle you will more than likely freeze to death because you have no idea what direction to go to get to shelter. Your best bet is to keep moving slowly and hope to feel the rumble strips on the sides and center of the road.

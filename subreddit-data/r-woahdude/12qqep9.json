To hope selling a piece like this which is expensive you need to reach the kind of people that buy in salons, art fairs and galeries. A good gallery might also do a lot of work in communication, help find you a place to work and mount other exhibitions but that's the really good ones.",

You left something important in your car so you sleepily drag your lethargic half asleep self towards your car. \nNot realizing fog or mist (is it smoke?) has crept between you and your abode. \n\nWithin a fraction of a second you are wide awake. Skin gone cold with goosebumps and hair standing on end. You tremble not understanding why your body has become soo primally stricken with fear. Then as though a clap of Thunder sounded. You hear slapping of bare feet walking with the pace quickening. Getting louder, faster, CLOSER! Your heart beating faster than it ever has. You think you should run for the door but fear has you locked in place waiting to see what this sound could be coming from. It\u2019s form human like yet proportionately off. Hobble walking at an unnaturally fast pace you pray it just goes past. You focus on this aberration not knowing what to make of it. As it continues on you finally let out a breath of relief. Only to have that draw it\u2019s attention and have it B-line straight toward you. The speed in which it\u2019s closing in on you is terrifying. What it wants what will it do you don\u2019t know and you don\u2019t want to take the chance. You scramble for the door of your car. Opening then slamming it shut locking the door just as IT arrives. You backpedal hitting your head hard it leaves a ringing in your ears your vision black. The ringing is getting louder your eyes shoot open your body oddly contorted as you find yourself half fallen out of bed. \n\nIt was all a wild dream. Pheww",

I've spent a lot of time studying the auditory system and in my free time human rights and personhood. So, it hit me in the feels?? Anyways, I love how raw and literally naked it is. And yet it has poise and confidence.\n\nAnd art is what the viewer makes of what the artist shares. Thank you :)",

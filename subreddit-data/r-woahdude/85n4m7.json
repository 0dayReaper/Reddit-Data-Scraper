            "comment": "Ok. I was in Costa Rica for a wedding a few years back and we rented a couple beautiful villas near the south-western coast. They were multi-levelled and had breathtaking views of the ocean and the jungle between us and it. My room was on one of the lower floors and had one of those \u201cjungle fresh\u201d bathrooms where there was just a pony wall about 3 ft high and a head-high curtain for privacy to separate you from the elements. Definitely nothing like OP\u2019s but I was still pretty stoked to be able to take a shower (or a dump) and still feel like I was in my own private jungle retreat. \n\nAs the property manager is taking us for a tour on our first night, he shows me the bathroom and says \u201cyou\u2019re going to want to shut your door and keep the bathroom light on at night.\u201d I said, \u201cwon\u2019t that attract a ton of bugs?\u201d He followed up with \u201cwould you rather turn your bathroom into a bat cave?\u201d..... Ugh. We were in a pretty rural area so my immediate concern was contracting some bat-bourn disease and not being able to get help so I took his advice. My dudes, I can\u2019t tell you how disgusting it was waking up in the middle of the night to take a piss and stumble into a hive of every jungle insect you could imagine. There were moths the size of my hand flapping their dirty-ass dusty wings everywhere. Mosquitos? Of course. Other flying things I couldn\u2019t identify? Check. I\u2019m not one to shy away from insects but the shear volume of them just creeped me the fuck out. \n\nAfter three nights of my room becoming a National Geographic case study I decided lights out was the only option. Thankfully no bats appeared and I made it home without dying. But I\u2019ll never book a room with an open shitter again!",

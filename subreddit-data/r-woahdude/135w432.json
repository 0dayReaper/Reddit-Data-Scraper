This is a pretty sick special - the show hadn\u2019t been on tv for a number of years, and a rival channel was about to go over into colour for the news that night. Aunty Jack had a one off revival special and beat them to colour by a matter of minutes",

Certainly wasn\u2019t on black and white sets, they were all exclusive VHF, at least here in Australia, we didn\u2019t have the population density to support the much smaller range.\nI saw it was used overseas from 1957 tho, you may have had an imported set.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UHF_television_broadcasting\n\n&gt;\tIn Australia, UHF was first anticipated in the mid-1970s with TV channels 27\u201369. The first UHF TV broadcasts in Australia were operated by Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) on channel 28 in Sydney and Melbourne starting in 1980, and translator stations for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The UHF band is now used extensively as ABC, SBS, commercial and public-access television services have expanded, particularly through regional areas.",

That's a single signal compositing the chrominance on top of the luminance, which is a good thing to keep in mind for how video works. Except for specialty situations, all video is still just a channel of black and white 'luminance' with 2 channels of 'chrominance ' added on top to give you still colour video. When you watch a video on YouTube or record a video on your phone, this is how it's encoded. Even in the broadcast and cinema industry, it is almost always like this.\n\nThe way that old broadcast signal worked was to still broadcast pretty much the same B+w signal, but add a chrominance sub carrier so that receivers that support the feature will show things in colour and older receivers will still function in b+w. This is also what created 'drop frame timecode' in NTSC, the 1/1.001 timing adjustment was done to accommodate the chrominance sub carrier and now 30/60 frames per second is 29.97/59.94. PAL and SECAM did a different approach and the timing adjustment was not needed.\n\nSo yeah, this is coming from a single camera and mixing between the luminance signal and the composite video.",

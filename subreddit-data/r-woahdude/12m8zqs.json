My disdain isn't rooted in the notion that AI will take my job or replace me in anyway, its rooted in the desire to protect people from being exploited, which currently models for art based generation do just that. They exploit the hard work of people who pursued their dreams and put in the time to create, something that a lot of people seem to not understand or not care about and are fine with exploiting people because they get to see soulless content mass produced at the behest of a few words. Which brings me to one of the other reasons of why i'm sick of seeing AI content. I think the way people see art is different from the perspective of an artist and the perspective of the audience. One of the reasons I like art and doing it is that you're giving a piece of yourself back to the world, that you spent the time painstakingly honing your craft to give back to the world and let people see things the way you do and hopefully inspire them. Now theres no soul to it, theres no life, no mistakes, just a machine telling you what you think you want to see and simply just approving the decisions made by a machine. I feel as if we're slowly relinquishing our humanity for easy short term hits of dopamine but thats a far more complex topic to go into.",

Hand drawn animation can takes weeks to months for 2 mins of video from start to finish if you're not in a studio for animation. Kentaro Miura when he was working on berserk was putting in 16 hour days. The average work day for a mangaka is 12-14 hours a day to meet chapter deadlines, and a lot of the time these mangaka die young. Miura died at 54 even after slowing down production of berserk to about 2 chapters a year and long hiatuses. You need to also understand when I'm talking about time spent its not just production of the art but years and years people spend honing their craft.\n\nOne thing I want to make clear though about AI. It's not really the outputs I care about. Some are impressive while others are just cheap and lifeless. This tech can very well be a boon for the art world if its properly regulated. There's a lot of AI functionality in art software like photoshop that streamlines tedious action and would be hypocritical to ignore that aspect of AI. What fully sets me against AI generated art is the exploitation of people who already get exploited. Until these models used in generation compensate and train with permission from artists I will be against AI generated art.",

I've played with a1111 enough to see how you could do it in theory, but implementation is never as easy as it seems. If I tried to do this I'd have to render a bunch of choices for every single frame and then pick out the 1 acceptable one. It'd take days, there must be a better way, or img2img settings that will give reliable results but still with enough variation.",

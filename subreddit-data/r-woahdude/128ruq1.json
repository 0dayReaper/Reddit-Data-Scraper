Misinformation will be rampant, ai cyber-ops will be very effective on older generations. Real victims will be ignored even more. Video evidence will no longer be enough. Actual evidence will be dismissed.\n\nI think most of media-related industries will be severely minimized, from photographers, to animators. Graphic design will be heavily reduced, photography and models wont be required much anymore unless they are already popular. Game Dev industry is already utilizing it to cut 25% of their development costs. \n\nIts going to be disruptive in the way the touch screen mobile phone was disrupting, but at a much larger scale. We will come out the other end with a new way of life most likely.",

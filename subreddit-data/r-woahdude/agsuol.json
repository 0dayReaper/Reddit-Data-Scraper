He cited the lack of research on noise induced hearing loss caused by low frequencies. Most of the the published stuff is mid/high frequency sounds. I looked at the time and didn't find anything focusing on low end either. I definitely wouldn't chance it with a system like EXOs that does 155dB+ but I'd like to see how 100db@30hz compares to 100db@15khz.",

Our ears are attenuated such that frequencies starting at around the 4 kHz range can start noticeably damaging hearing based on decibel levels. But be warned that at high enough energy levels even with low Hz sounds can damage the fine hairs in your ears. Also consider the pressure caused by lower frequency sounds as this can damage the ear drum.",

Looking at a spectrograph analysis of any song will show that the bass registry is orders of magnitude higher in db than the mids and highs. The side effect of being tuned to human speech is that the hairs aren't moved that much from bass tones, giving some sort of pseudo protection from hearing damage from those sources. \n\nBut I agree, in high amounts any sound can and will fuck you up.

Bass frequencies penetrate easily because of how long their wavelengths are. So less likely to suffer hearing loss or damage. But if you blast the shit out of it with huge amps, then you're increasing the possible energy that'll be transferred to your body, which can then cause damage.",

All sound, regardless of frequency, enters the cochlea in the same location and passes through the region of hair cells dedicated to the highest frequencies first working its way to the hair cells in the center of the cochlea that are associated with the lowest \u201cbass\u201d tones. You do hear it, even if it seems more like you feel it. We call this a vibrotactile sensation. The only way you would feel it and not also be hearing it is if it were below 20 Hz, however it\u2019s unlikely to be a pure tone and therefore will likely have many formants in frequencies you can hear, or if you have significant hearing loss at that specific frequency, but again it is unlikely a pure tone and you will likely be able to hear the formants. What\u2019s very destructive about this is it blasts all the hair cells in the entire cochlea, not just those associated with these low bass tones and repeated exposure to loud noise just increases your risk of noise induced hearing loss more. Anything that causes hearing loss causes tinnitus, and when you have hearing loss you\u2019re more likely to hear the tinnitus you have. Unless you want to wear hearing aids or hear tinnitus forever, please be responsible with your hearing.  \n\nI have a doctorate in hearing and balance sciences.",

Actually, I lost both of them the other day, and not having them sucks even more. Hearing loss really just sucks in generall. \n\nImagine only understanding people if they litterally look at you and yell, and hearing your name but nothing else while people talk about you 10 feet away because they know you can't hear.\n\nImagine hanging out with your friends, and missing the entire conversation that everybody else is engaged in unless you ask for every line to be repeated to you. Also, hope your friends like subtitles.\n\nOr then you get hearing aids. Now you can hear people talk at a somewhat reasonable speaking level, but only if you are sitting in your livingroom with no background noise. In a bar or resturaunt, forget about it. In the car on the freeway? Good luck. Sitting in a class while people mumble to eachother behind you, better hope whatever the teacher was saying is in the book. \n\nAnd then somebody drops a coin on a hard floor, or a little kid squeals, and it's the loudest, most ear splitting sound you have heard in your life. But you still put the fuckers in every morning because it's still better than not hearing anybody. Until you lose them because they are tiny little hearing aids and can't afford to drop a couple thousand on replacing them.\n\nHearing loss sucks.

VapingwithTwisted420 is his YouTube channel, and he's actually a really funny guy!\n\nI used to work in a vape shop (it's a big industry where I live, and I needed a job fast, my wonderful husband got me an interview with his boss, and it worked out!), and we would play various coil building videos and juice/hardware review videos on the TV's in the shop, and this guy was easily my favorite. \n\nIt may just be because he was moderately local and seemed pretty funny and nice and genuine, or just that he seemed that way compared to fuckin RiPTrippers, but either way I always liked the guy.\n\n[Here's](https://youtu.be/_KoXrCzCoYw) an old tech review he did of some spy glasses if anyone wants to see what he's like!\n\nEdit: Ooh, and [here's](https://youtu.be/D_6BG-LBcn0) the gif source!\n\nTLDR: Douchey name, great dude",

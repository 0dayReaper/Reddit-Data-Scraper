What you'd want to do is draw a free body diagram of the whales initial conditions taking into account depth pressure, bouyant force, gravity and whale propulsion force. Then looking at where the whale hits the peak of its jump we can determine how far down the whale started and how fast it was going to catch its sick air.",

As others have said, crushing parasites is a strong likelohood, though communication is another likely condition. Often times, we will witness a whale breach and another will seemingly reciprocate not to far away. Other times, calves will breach over and over again while the adults feed. I've even seen FOUR full grown humpbacks breach all at once like some fountain of whales. Christ, I just got off the water after 12 hours of choppy seas why the hell am I still talking about whales???",

Of course, the cruise eventually came to an end, and we all had to at last climb off /u/kayjay25's mom's back and set foot once again on dry land.",

Most importantly, you're not taxed on money you borrow and not selling assets that go up in value or give you control of your company.\n\nSo your assets earn more money than the debt repayments so you come out ahead *and* when you die - your kids' inheritance has huge tax advantages. \n\nSo you get out of paying a huge chunk in taxes while alive and when you die the taxman loses his cut of everything you've earned.",

Let's say conservatively that 200M of them are working age and therefore could benefit from a Bezos Stimulus\u2122. Everyone would get $1000 if his entire net worth was liquified and distributed to the eligible US populace (obv less if we sent it to everyone above 18).\n\nNow $1000 is still a lot of money, but consider that the US government sent almost every 18+ citizen almost $2000 last year and no one's lives changed appreciably.\n\nJeff Bezos is filthy rich, but he is not the sole reason that you (or any other American) may be struggling. He's certainly a great lightning rod for corporate greed criticism though.\n\nEdit: Since people are harping on the fact that Bezos is just one of many billionaires, let's do the same experiment with all [630 billionaires](https://questionerlab.com/how-many-billionaires-are-in-the-us) in the US. If we liquidated ALL of their assets and disbursed it equally among 320 million people, that's a one-time payment of $10,625 to everyone. Not a permanent raise, not a recurring payment, but a one time bought-a-scratch-off-and-won-10k moment. Now I'm not scoffing at $10k - I'd take it with a smile, but that's ten iPhones. Four MacBooks. A down payment on a car or (in some neighborhoods) a down payment on a very small house. \n\nUnless you are living in abject poverty, $10k is not life-changing money. It's very nice, but it's not life changing. It's less than one year of minimum wage salary.",

A couple around the world in fact, let\u2019s buy 3.\n\n$940M left\n\nGotta get between those houses somehow. Let\u2019s buy a nice private jet, those go for about $50M new.\n\n$890M left\n\nNeed some sort of hobby, maybe I\u2019ll collect sports cars. 10 at $5M each.\n\n$840M left\n\nOk, let\u2019s talk recurring expenses.\n\nCosts some money to run those houses. A reasonable guess is that a larger house costs about 1% of the house value between taxes, maintenance, etc. so let\u2019s round up and say a million dollars a year between 3 of them.\n\nDefinitely going to need some people to take care of these houses, let\u2019s say a high end butler ($150k), 3 housekeepers ($60k each), and a pilot ($200k). Wage bill per house is now $550k per year. So like $1.5M per year.\n\nNeed to fuel and run the plane. These things cost maybe $3000/hr to run, and I fly 20 hours per week between my houses. $60k per week, $3M per year.\n\nNo point in being rich if you don\u2019t eat well. I\u2019m going to spend $1k a day just on eating out. $365k per year.\n\nEverybody needs fun money. For some it\u2019s an extra glass of wine after work, for others it\u2019s dropping $50k a day on I don\u2019t even fucking know what. Maybe art or something, or heaven forbid, charity. Whatever you\u2019re spending it on, that\u2019s about $18.25M/year.\n\nHave I described a pretty decent lifestyle? Honestly I\u2019m having trouble thinking of anything else to spend it on that makes even the slightest difference to the overall numbers. Well, it adds up to about $25M a year. 4% interest on $840M is $33.6M per year. With one billion dollars, you could live like that forever, with $8M a year to spare and without ever touching the principal.",

The goal should be an adequately progressive income tax with several tiers. In order to amass their wealth, the wealthy have utilized many more public resources than the poor have, so they should pay higher taxes.\n\nA more progressive income tax is definitely not going to solve everything, but it's a start. The rest of the solution involves addressing capital gains taxes and issues like stepped-up basis and the inheritance tax, corporate taxes, tax loopholes, tax breaks (we give more away in tax breaks every year than we spend in the entire federal budget), and the ability of the rich to take out large, low-interest loans using their stocks as collateral to avoid taxes, etc., but those are very complicated, very nuanced issues.",

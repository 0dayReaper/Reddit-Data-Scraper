Super neato, though. Would be much easier while dancing to the beat as well as the timing would be along cue with the song.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: as some have mentioned, there are definitely setups that use palm mirrors and if this was a big expensive setup there is a chance that the entire light setup is activated (in this case de-activated) along with the lasers in hand, which would make the timing a non-issue BUT were that the case, it would still have to be in the correct POSITION which is a whole other issue. You'd still have to line up with the show directly so the choreography HAS to be perfect anyway, in which case the timing would be a simple addition once you know the song.  \n\n------------------\n\nEdit 2: holy fuck. Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! Also this is by far my top comment now. \n\nCheers everyone! The reddit love is much appreciated.",

There is a laser projector in the floor facing straight up.  This is run off a 25 pin connection called ILDA and is synchronized in a timeline with the music.  Likely software for this would be LD2000, Quickshow, or Pangolin BEYOND.\n\n2.  In his hands are double sided laser pointers.  You can buy these from sites like Goldenstar Laser for about $25 dollars.  They are not automated.  They have 2 buttons, one for top and bottom lasers.\n\n3.  This is very, very well practiced.  I've never had the chance to do one of these shows myself, but they're designed much the same way as a typical laser show you'd see at Ultra Music Festival or similar.\n\n4.  There are no mirrors in his hands at the point where he bends the beam.  The laser in the floor is significantly more powerful, because it has to aim away from the audience (upward) and thus does not refract nearly as well, so it needs the extra power to be as visible.  When he bends the beam he is blocking the floor beam with his hand while also turning on his laser pointer.  Using a mirror for this would be insanely dangerous.\n\nHope that sums it up.  If you have any laser show related questions I'm happy to answer them.\n\n[Proof of my profession here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTp5lqVght0)",

The closest you'd get is wireless midi or OSC into the control software.  It is certainly on a timeline!  I'm willing to bet the choreography is on point because the man wrote the show himself, so he knows exactly when and where the beams will fire.",

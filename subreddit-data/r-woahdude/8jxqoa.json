It was all over the audiophile and DJ news but I haven\u2019t seen much of an update since then. I wonder if they\u2019re still working on design and pre-production, or if they quietly gave up.",

One of the great perks of that (on top of going to Disneyland) is that you get to see backstage. This was in 2000 or so, so I didn't have a camera on me, so I couldn't violate the rule of \"no pictures\" but they did show us a lot of neat stuff about how the park works.\n\nOne thing that's really great, is that they re-use as much stuff as they possibly can. I saw old models of Splash Mountain boats being taken apart, character heads being re-purposed and the like. I guarantee, if they took it apart, somewhere those sculptures are being put to use. ",

You don't see the effect in cars in natural light unless there is something that blocks your view in a regular way, like fence pickets or something like that.",

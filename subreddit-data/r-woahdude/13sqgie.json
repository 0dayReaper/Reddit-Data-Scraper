Seems like it\u2019s a slap in the face to true talent like yours and I love the whacky creatures that YOU thought of and made! Do you sketch the stuff out on paper first or just have a rough idea and send it? Do you ever do like dark or scary looking monsters? I would love to buy a toothy little critter for my desk if I wasn\u2019t a broke bitch atm lol. Sry for all the questions this is intriguing to me",

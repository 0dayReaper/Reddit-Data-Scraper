The SCRAMBLE gear failed and the entirety of MTF-Tau-1 was killed as a result. Also, Oleksei was in a break room that didn't exist, and Dan was unnecessarily on a research expedition in the mountain ranges  when more qualified personnel  was available.  I think the implication is that the doctors knew that SCRAMBLE wouldn't work, but said that it did.  They purposefully let the Tau squad get massacred so that their request for a kill order on 096 would be granted.",

You don't get hurt by it because of two reasons essentially: the current is very small, and the time the static discharges through your finger is incredibly short amount of time.\n\nhere's another: you know how when you rub a cat and get all static-y and then you touch the tip of their ear, that part almost always discharges first? The pointy geometry of the ear is the reason. Electricity discharges through a point like that more easily than a round shape. This is why you see round balls on top of tesla coils or similar looking devices. It keeps the charge from escaping. The concept is used all over the power grid and power line components to minimize any static electricity discharging into the air or other nearby things. ",

If you can't do the work without copying someone else's work, that's kind of the definition of 'ripped off', although derivative is probably more accurate, especially when dealing with creative output.\n\nJust my 2 cents",

AI is directly referencing a massive dataset of images lifted off the internet. Also, I do not dispute the fact that people can rip off other people\u2019s art. It\u2019s not always inspiration and those ppl deserve to get called out too. \n\nWhen AGI is achieved and it starts consciously creating art, I\u2019ll adapt my stance accordingly. But for now, the current models rely on images lifted from artists who have not consented in feeding the dataset. \n\nGenerative AI is incredible technology for sure, but let\u2019s be realistic here.",

Our \"AI\" isn't anywhere near complex enough to interpret the original then expand on it or add \"their\" own spin with the goal of changing the message. \n\nThere's a reason most AI generated art is so obvious. It's shallow, it has no meaning, it has no soul. AI generated art is great at generating pretty objects, but generating pretty objects isn't all that art is, art needs emotion and computers don't have emotion.\n\nEdit: I think the account I'm talking to is the same person as OP. The arguments are too similar, and there are way too many similarities between the way they talk",

And while we admire that architecture, it's the details, the parts that aren't mathematical that draws us in. Look at the Parthenon. The ancient Greeks held math in very high regard and many of their buildings (including the Parthenon) used important ratios and formulas that we are still drawn to today. But it's not that stuff that makes the Parthenon such an important structure today. It's mainly the history behind it, the goals and desires of the creators, and thr intricate stonework that have made it such an important ancient building.",

They aren\u2019t putting a brush to a canvas even figuratively; they had a thought about art, but then they didn\u2019t do any of the process themselves. They didn\u2019t have to spend time intimately acquainting themselves with the specifics and the methods of the original artist, they don\u2019t have to try and fail and adapt and persevere, they don\u2019t have to think about what would best communicate their point, and reiterate and refine on those ideas themselves; a creative process that we like to think changes the artist as much as viewing the art changes us. It\u2019s called mid journey but the AI takes over a LOT of the journey, leaving very little left for the human to do. \n\nI think the prompting process is somewhat creative and (obviously) has the potential to create really cool visual images and that is definitely going to have its place in media. But as far as what constitutes an artist; a conscious being committed to the journey of creation, and the piece of resultant art; not only itself, but also a symbol and an affirmation of that conscious creative process, well, the AI really reduces that journey from the humans\u2019 perspective.",

I\u2019d add though that since so much of art is what the viewer interprets, the end result can be very much the same - something the viewer can appreciate.

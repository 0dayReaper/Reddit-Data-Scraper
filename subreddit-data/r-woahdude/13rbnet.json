In focus, blurry, particles, smoke effects etc. A lot of them are rendered as one colour because I found you can lose a lot of detail from one half of the fractals once it's set up in PS because of layer styles etc. I do render a few with multiple colours though as they are good to mix in on the top layers of the image for some extra details. By rendering your fractals in one colour it's really just an exercise in time saving as you can just colour them in PS afterward anyway but I found I was doing it a lot so I just colour the few I need now. I use Apophysis to make my fractals and PS to bash it together.

I'm not opposed to A.I, they can produce some mad looking images and it definitely has a place in the big scheme of things, but it comes with too many constraints for me to want to use them.",

The second image I fired off flash with an orange colored plastic acetate sheet and the third is with a purple one. \n\nThe fourth image is of the sky that night at a higher iso with my camera on an astro tracker mount. This mount slowly rotates to match the earth's rotation. there are some variable I won't get into but without the mount the stars will start to get blurry after 20-30 seconds due to the earth's rotation. With the mount I can have longer exposures. \n\nI wanna say the moon was at 82% waxing this night so while the sky gets really dark here I couldn't get much of the milky core because the bright moon washes a lot of stars out. \n\nThen I combine all the images in photoshop. Blending the various colors of flash lighting takes a long time to get a natural look. Through trial an error I probably spend 6+ hours editing this in photoshop. \n\nThank you!",

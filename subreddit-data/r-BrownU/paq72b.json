    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019ve never been off meal plan before and I wanted to ask what that\u2019s like for people. Do you ever feel left out when friends want to hang out at the ratty or whatever? That\u2019s one of the main things I\u2019m nervous about, to be honest. I would love to hear people\u2019s thoughts on the pros and cons of going off meal plan.",

I stayed on meal plan because I eat a ton and meal credits were the best value for me but my friends who went off didn\u2019t really miss out on social opportunities!",

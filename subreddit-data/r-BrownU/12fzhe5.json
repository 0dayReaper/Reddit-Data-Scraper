Just dab them up, call them bro, and start telling them about yourself (or something similar). I\u2019m an anxious person too\u2014just let anxiety be damned with this one.\n\n95% of us (and probably 99% at ADOCH, because a very small proportion made friends groups at ADOCH) were on a clean slate, so just going up to people and talking is incredibly effective. Most people won\u2019t even remember your name if you don\u2019t get their phone numbers.",

The best part is, there\u2019s gonna be about 2,000 other people out there, so you can just move on and forget about their bullshit",

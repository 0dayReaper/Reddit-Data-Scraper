    "postText": "Hi, I am an incoming freshman at Brown hoping to study Computer Science. My question may be stupid.\n\nI have been recently researching the Computer Science program at Brown and I have come across this page: [https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/index.php?q=post\\_grad\\_data/concentration/COMP](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/careerlab/index.php?q=post_grad_data/concentration/COMP)\n\nIt presents the alumni pathways that computer science students chose right after graduating from Brown. Some have become Analysts, Data scientists, Frontend Engineers, and the majority became Software Engineers at top industries and sectors. \n\nIs there a specific track that a student must take to become a Software Engineer or Data Scientist for instance? The Brown website does not show any track other than the \"Standard Track of Sc.B. degree\". Or is the title \"Software Engineer\" only given upon employment?",

Software engineer in industry is also synonymous with developer, it\u2019s not a big deal and any of the CS tracks in the AB or BsC will allow you to enter industry as a software engineer",

    "postText": "Hey everyone ! I just found out I got accepted to the PhD history program at Brown and I\u2019m super excited to get the opportunity to go to my dream school! \n\nHowever, I am from sunny San Diego and will be moving across the country to do so. \n\nMy question is what housing options are there near campus or around Providence would you recommend ? My budget is flexible but generally I do not want to pay more than 1,800 for rent.  Ideally just a single bedroom or studio apartment just for myself. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated thank you !",

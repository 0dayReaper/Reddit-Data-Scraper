            "comment": "From what I understand, it is incredibly rare to get an acceptance rescinded on grades alone (I imagine even more so for an ED acceptance). It is not entirely uncommon for a student to receive a warning if their Mid-Year Report shows a substantial decline in grades, but from my recollections these are largely a scare tactic and very rarely have actual action taken over them, even in cases where grades don't improve.\n\nI would hazard a guess that Bs are almost entirely okay, and that a C or 2 will most likely be overlooked if the rest of your grades are good. Anything below that and you are reaching a point where you would possibly receive a warning.",

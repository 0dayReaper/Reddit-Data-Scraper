    "postText": "Hey guys! I was recently accepted to Browns class of 2026. However, I\u2019m having trouble with financial aid. My expected contribution is 57k dollars, yet my family is only able to pay 15k since my mother and sister are in graduate schools. However, brown doesn\u2019t account for graduate schools in their aid packages. So I tried looking at outside scholarships to fund the remaining 42k deficit. But, Brown says that my outside scholarships can only replace my summer work/job responsibilities. The remaining amount will subtract their University scholarship dollar for dollar. Basically any scholarship will decrease their need based aid and will leave me in the same amount of debt, unless I get scholarships worth browns full tuition. So does this mean that I am either forced into loans/debt in order to go to Brown or look for 83k in scholarships? Or are there any other options?",

Coming out of college with $100k+ in student loans is horrible. I assume you were admitted ED, but IIRC it\u2019s possible to get out of it if attending isn\u2019t financially viable. That\u2019s definitely a worst-case scenario, but if another school will be significantly cheaper, my opinion as a Brown student is that going here isn\u2019t worth a hugely detrimental amount in loans. \n\nTrying to get anything more than $10-20k in outside scholarships seems pretty much impossible to me, and it would already be an amazing stroke of luck to get that much. I wish you the best of luck figuring this out; let me know if there\u2019s any more input you want from me! I receive significant financial aid here and I\u2019ve talked to many other students about it, so I\u2019m somewhat familiar with things. Again, appealing to the financial aid office is your best bet. Earlier is almost certainly better, because as time goes on they will allot more aid to future admits and will likely begin to be more stingy.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone!\n\nAs part of a consulting project, my team is currently collecting data by surveying and interviewing dozens of college students across the country in order to better understand student preference, sentiment, and behavior towards innovation in financial services (e.g. app-based brokerages, digital banking, etc). In an effort to further a student initiative, I kindly ask for your collaboration by filling out this quick 3 minute [survey](https://forms.gle/uyvv2bt9V4qaBhdh9)! Also, please indicate that Marden referred you to this survey.\n\nThanks!\n\n[Survey Link](https://forms.gle/uyvv2bt9V4qaBhdh9)",

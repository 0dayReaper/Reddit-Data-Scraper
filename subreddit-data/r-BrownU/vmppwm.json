    "postText": "I am a freshmen entering this fall and would like some opinions on the following:\n\n1) Some say Andrews/Miller/Metcalf are isolated and lacking in social life. Is this true? Would living there impact social life and meeting people?\n\n2) Would being in a single as freshman detract from making friends and social life? What are the advantages and disadvantages with having a roommate? (I have a disability that could merit a single.)\n\n3) Are single rooms for freshman generally as nice as the doubles?\n\n4) Does Brown social life revolve around the dorm where you stay? Or do you mostly make friends in other places (clubs, courses, etc), so where you stay does not matter as much.",

There\u2019s a lot of advantages and disadvantages idk what your priorities are.\n\n3. I think so, I\u2019ve only seen a few. First year dorms are overall nice and large.\n\n4. You certainly can make a friend group in your dorm or quad etc but that is totally not necessary and socializing outside of that is very easy to do.",

Being in a single won\u2019t impact your social life at all. A double is nice though because if you get lucky you can get a roommate that becomes one of the best friends you can have. It also teaches you how to live with another person, which can be an important skill to have. \n3. I was in a single freshmen year. It was just as nice as a double, only slightly smaller.\n4. Uhm\u2026.no. I mean, you can certainly have a friend group in your dorm, but you can also meet people in clubs, classes, etc.",

If anything, it might be better, because you can have people over at any time that's convenient to you without having a roommate's schedule to worry about\n\n3- None of the dorms are nice \ud83e\udd72 they're mid at best, but the singles def aren't worse. \n\n4- Revolve? Definitely not. But it had an impact for me; of my 6 closest college friends, 3 are from my freshman dorm, and 3 are from other things. YMMV.",

            "comment": "1. No. Basically half the freshmen are in North campus. Also, you're likely to hang out around classes and wherever your club sessions take place and people there. Your dorm is just another place to meet people and the social scene also depends on your floormates.\n2. Singles are really a personal preference. I didn't have the best of friendships with my roommate but it was nice to have someone around me. It also depends on whether you  would feel isolated in a single or not.\n3. No clue. I think doubles feel more spacious because there's more space to walk around. Furniture wise, I think all your stuff would fit your single and give you space. You can also checkout floorplans and see how rooms are spaced out if you're really interested.\n4. I had a group of friends in my dorm and its usually the place where you make your orientation friends. But after that people decide their own thing. I didn't stay in my dorm much as a personal preference but many people prefer to study and hang out and party in lounges. I think I met more people in classes and clubs and across all year groups (thus, not in freshman dorms).",

            "comment": "1. No, in fact the opposite might hold more truth.  In my freshman year there was a super tight knit group of friends that had all met in Andrews and did everything together.  For real it was like stumbling in on the set of Friends (the show) or How I Mer Your Mother\n2. No\n3. The ones I\u2019ve seen \u2014 yes\n4. It certainly has a lot of influence imo because its more convenient to spend time with people who are nearby \u2014 anf when you don\u2019t know anyone convenience tends to take top priority when deciding who to hang out with",

            "comment": "1. Personally think it\u2019s the best area because of proximity to Andrew\u2019s commons and 5 other freshman dorms. \n2. I really only made friends through my roommates because we were so close but you\u2019ll just have to be proactive about connecting with people you encounter. Shouldn\u2019t be a big problem regardless :)\n3. I never actually saw a freshman single but it\u2019ll depend on the building. They should be similar to doubles and triples. \n4. Again, I mostly hung out with people in my hall and rarely ventured to south campus but you could definitely make some decent friendships through clubs (talking wasn\u2019t super common in my classes so you\u2019ll have to be pretty outgoing and lucky to connect only through class)",

Unfortunately due to my late start, the majority of tours are filled.\n\nWould it be acceptable if I just went on a random weekend and walked around? The university website says it\u2019s allowed but things seem sticky to the ever-rising amount of COVID cases.\n\nThanks! (not sure if this is against the rules - it\u2019s more of a social question that admissions lol)",

    "postText": "My partner and I will be moving out to Providence in late August to attend grad school at Brown and RISD and are looking for a one bedroom apartment if possible. We live in the Midwest so we won\u2019t be able to see if before we sign more than likely. We\u2019re really having a difficult time finding places in the $1,000-$1,500 range in a safe neighborhood. If anyone knows of anything let us know! Thanks!",

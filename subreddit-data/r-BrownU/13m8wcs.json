    "postText": "\\*i saw two other posts just like this, so yes i am also ripping off the format lol\n\nSo I just got off the Brown waitlist 2 days ago. I\u2019ve committed to UChicago, but I\u2019m also seriously considering Brown. (a caveat worth noting is that I also got off UChicago WL and they offered me admission into class of 2028, so a gap year,,,,also lowk scared that Chicago agreement was binding and both schools will rescind if I choose Brown.)\n\nI am really interested in econ/applied math/finance. I have some questions about Brown:\n\n1. How\u2019s the job opportunities compared Chicago, specifically into Wall St?\n2. What is Providence like? (Opportunities, safety, fun, weather?)\n3. Unique things about Brown? Special certificates or Programs?\n4. How is Econ department at brown? I know Brown is not as strong as Chicago in some of these areas.\n5. What are some cons to brown?\n\nPlease let me know everything you love and hate about Brown. I have a week to respond to Brown (is it worth visiting in this time frame?). Anything is helpful!",

Don\u2019t let UChicago force you to take a gap year (bullshit imo), your contract with them is not binding, finance placement is similar (slight edge to UC) enough that you shouldn\u2019t base a decision off of that. Econ is pretty strong and well respected at Brown.\n\nUnless you\u2019re passionate about Econ academia, the incremental prestige at Chicago\u2019s dept is not worth going to the school \u201cwhere fun goes to die\u201d. Worth calling out Brown has a stellar applied math department as well that is better than Chicago\u2019s.\n\nGo where you personally fit in best. For most people, the only reasons to pick Chicago are for the city and the school\u2019s intensity/rigor-although their basic Econ is pretty chill fwiw. Brown imo is a much more enjoyable and equally if not more fulfilling experience. Best of luck!",

            "comment": "Old Brown alum here....\n\nI graduated from Brown far too many years ago and I worked at the University of Chicago for eight years as a computer programmer/statistician in the Medical School. (I have a PhD in Mathematics from Illinois, so I have been around the block at quite a few big schools.)\n\nMy impression of undergraduate school at U of C is that it is highly rigorous and competitive and takes second place to the graduate programs. That means you may find yourself on your own at some time or another. That is a very lonely place to be. \n\nAs I remember my time at Brown, I was able to find people I could talk to about academic problems. I do not want to emphasize this too much, but I am not sure you could do that at U of C. \n\nI know quite a few people who were undergraduates at U of C and many of them are inordinately proud that they could get through such a demanding schedule. Some of them carried this toughness through into their professional lives. It is not clear to me that it helped them that much. Once again, I don't want to emphasize this, but some of them are real jerks. (I am also certain Brown puts out its own quota of jerks. I just think the attitude of Chicago gives it the edge on jerkness.)\n\nPros of Brown: A calm, sane place. - This was the phrase the Princeton Review used many years ago. https://www.princetonreview.com/\n\nPros of U of C: Deeply intellectual. Can be tough as nails if you think you need that.\n\nCons of Brown: Providence. (I grew up in Providence. I can say that.)\n\nCons of Chicago: Chicago. This is not a joke. If you wander too far off the beaten path at the U of C, you will be in some very bad neighborhoods. I lived in the Chicago area for about 18 years and there were times I was very glad that I look large and menacing.\n\nIf you worry what people will say when you graduate, don't. Both schools will give you a fine education. \n\nAs for weather, Chicago definitely has worse weather. U of C is very close to Lake Michigan and the winds can be awful! Look up \"Average temperature Winter\" for both Providence and Chicago to get some idea.\n\nChicago has, I think, a much better cultural scene. The Art Institute is wonderful. The Chicago Symphony and the Lyric Opera are first rate. (I really miss them.) If you are a sports enthusiast, Chicago has all sorts of professional teams. \n\nProvidence has Boston teams and culture. (I still root for the Red Sox.)\n\nThe problem with both cities is getting to the venues. They can be far away.\n\nOne other thing. Providence has hills. Chicago is as flat as a pancake. I miss hills.\n\nBoth cities have lousy traffic. Both are pretty dirty.\n\nBrown does have a sort of campus town nearby where you can go out to eat if you are so inclined. U of C does not have much of that. \n\nU of C's athletic facilities are poor. \n\nIn closing, look up both U of C and Brown in The Princeton Review. That might help. https://www.princetonreview.com/ \n\nGood luck.\n\nPS: Someone mentioned the phrase \"where fun goes to die.\" That is a phrase in common use to describe U of C. Another one is \"Who says hell can't freeze over?\"",

            "comment": "I'm a mom of a senior who was admitted to UChicago and Brown this year.  We visited both campuses.  He had a better $$ offer from UChicago plus they paid for flight/hotel for visit.  The campus was beautiful and we've always loved Chicago (we live in Georgia about an hour outside Atlanta.)  Campus is not in the best area and is quite a distance from downtown.\n\nWhen we visited Brown, we absolutely loved Providence and the campus.  It's a short train ride to Boston and not too far from other large cities NYC/Philly.  He also has a few friends going to Yale and Harvard and we have family in NY - so there's that.\n\nUltimately though, it came down to culture.  He didn't want 4 years of potential misery of grueling coursework and SAD (seasonal affective disorder) that might come with the bone-chilling winters!  Brown is routinely voted one of the happiest campuses and offers so much flexibility and room for exploration.\n\nI went to Georgia Tech so I somewhat identify with the college torture (so I changed my major to escape Calculus!)  Most GT alum wear it like a badge of honor but if I had the opportunity to go to an Ivy Leage and it was affordable AND I could have had a more pleasant experience I would have done it in a heartbeat.  Alas, I did not.\n\nMy kid does not have a cut-throat, competitive personality so I don't see him looking for that type of career after graduation.  If you do, then maybe Chicago is a better place.\n\nFollow your gut - and if you go to Brown you may run into my son :-)",

            "comment": "Sorry this is maybe not actually answering your question, but I think it may still be helpful\n\nOne thing I hear talking about courses with friends at other schools is that they take the courses in their major and then they throw in the gen eds that seem least bad. In comparison, at brown people are usually throwing in a 4th class (or 5th if you want a more academically rigorous semester) as a \u201cfun\u201d class, often S/NC (pass/fail), just so that they can explore something interesting outside their program.\n\nI imagine with the core curriculum at UChicago you wouldn\u2019t often get the chance to incorporate fun random courses into your schedule. I think the question really comes down to how much control you personally want to have over your academics and how much you like UChicago\u2019s core curriculum",

            "comment": "I honestly do not have any insight into how a gap year makes getting in to Brown easier or harder.  But I do encourage you to change your perspective on something.  You said you didn't have a chance to do any \"skill building\" because you had to deal with a family emergency issue.  However, dealing with emergency issues can development tremendous skills.  Whatever it is you dealt with required you to use some kind of skills.  If it was a health issue, you probably learned a lot about the medical field.  If it was a financial issue, maybe you had to work an extra job.  Whatever it was, you had to build your resilience and perseverance skills to overcome a difficult situation.  I believe you can sell this on your application to set you apart form other applicants who didn't have to overcome such adversity.  Good luck with your application process!  I'm sure your resiliency and perseverance skills that you have already built will help you with the process.",

    "postText": "I was recently accepted to Brown RD for the class of 2026 as an intended chemistry major on the pre-med track and I'm having a really hard time deciding if Brown is the place for me. I know Brown is great for pre-med with the PLME program, but I didn't apply for that so I'm wondering how is pre-med at Brown for those who are not in the 8-year program? How competitive is pre-med at Brown and how easy is it to do research? How are the pre-professional counselors? For those who already applied to med school, do you think that the relaxed environment at Brown helped or hurt your application? Any insight will be greatly appreciated! The commitment deadline is in a week and I still have no clue where I should go :(",

I\u2019ve found premed advising to be not great but fine - research kinda hard to get but if u email enough people you\u2019ll find something. Not too competitive everyone helps each other out bc curves (grade cutoffs at brown) are usually determined before the semester. Generally people get good acceptances from brown but pretty much everyone takes a gap year after senior year",

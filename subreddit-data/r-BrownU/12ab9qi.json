    "postText": "So I recently got accepted into Brown\u2019s engineering program and Northwestern\u2019s engineering program, and I was wondering which one should I choose?  I live all the way on the coast in the south and do not know much about the geography nor how people live up there.  I\u2019m poor so the price doesn\u2019t really matter, I just want to make the right choice.",

            "comment": "Hello! I had to make the same decision a couple years ago (as a transfer student). I chose Brown because I thought Northwestern would pretty much give me the same type of education as my previous university. Engineering is usually a very structured major regardless of the school due to ABET requirements, and the ScB at Brown is just as structured. However, Brown also offers a flexible engineering degree called an \"AB in engineering\" if you feel you want to explore fields outside your comfort zone. Pretty much the AB allows you to cut the number of major requirements from 21 credits to 8, which is HUGE. I took classes in Czechoslovakian film, geology, business, computer science, education, ethics, and more simply because the open curriculum made it so easy to do so. The flexibility of the open curriculum allowed me to discover my true passion (STEM education), when I was originally pursuing engineering \"just cuz.\"\n\nPeople might say \"You can do that at any school,\" which is true, but I remember from my old school that engineering kind of forced people to pick the easiest electives (rather than the most interesting) for their mandatory intellectual breadth courses to balance the courseload and buffer their GPA. At Brown, GPA doesn't exist. Furthermore, you can take ALL of your classes (including your engineering ones) SNC, which takes a huge load off your shoulder. Advisors (professors) would help you determine what's appropriate/inappropriate to take SNC based off of your future goals. One of my advisors told me that since I wasn't premed/law, that I should feel free to take whatever I wanted SNC my first year at Brown.\n\nIf you're dead set on becoming an engineer, are competitive, and have a lot of discipline, Northwestern might be better. It has more interdisciplinary design project teams (think solar car and concrete canoe type stuff), industry-sponsored design projects, and (from what I hear) more impressive research opportunities if you're qualified enough to attain them. However, as I hinted before, most people aren't 100% sure they want to be an engineer while applying to college.\n\nAlso, [here](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-study-engineering-at-Brown-Brown-isnt-ranked-very-high-in-engineering-compared-to-MIT-Caltech-etc-but-does-this-seem-to-affect-the-engineering-experience-at-all) is a Quora post that strongly influenced my decision.",

            "comment": "I'm a sophomore that just declared computer engineering. I can't say anything about Northwestern, but Brown engineers are top notch and tight knit. As another commenter said, it's possible to do engineering with flexibility, and I think that extends beyond the AB as well. I've been able to take tons of CS classes and I have engineering friends that have taken screenwriting, history, and many more cool courses while also being heavily involved in research and/or engineering clubs (car team, space engineering, etc). One thing to check is that Brown offers the discipline you want, the program is on the smaller side so we don't have everything a place like Penn State might have (for example, no civil or aerospace). Good luck with your decision!",

            "comment": "Hey! I\u2019m from the Midwest a few hours away from Northwest but I\u2019m currently at Brown for my Masters. I don\u2019t know anything about either schools engineering programs but I know about the people &amp; general life in both areas! \n\nMidwesterners are the nicest people you\u2019ll ever meet and prices in the area are generally pretty equal to that of the south\u2019s but the winter is killer and the snow is no joke so just think about walking around and stuff during then. There\u2019s usually tones of farmers markets and festivals in Chicago which you should be able to get to pretty quickly from Evanston. The food and night life in the area is good if that\u2019s important to you! Overall I\u2019d encourage it, everyone downplays the Midwest but there\u2019s a lot of really amazing gems hidden if you take the time to look! \n\nProvidence is EXTREMELY different than anything I have ever grown up around. People are more standoffish and just generally rude (not Brown specifically but the surrounding area). Brown is located on College hill and it\u2019s is a legitimate hill that will kick your butt until you get used to climbing it depending on where you live also the wind is KILLER from basically November to March. It\u2019s also insanely expensive and if you don\u2019t live on campus you can expect rent to be near $1,500 for a one bedroom. Groceries are a lot more too. Aside from that, I (25f) have always felt incredibly safe walking by myself even out near midnight. Not a lot of crime or anything like that to worry about except the occasional porch thief. Thayer street has some awesome restaurants and getting to downtown Providence and the mall and train station is super easy. \n\nGood luck with your decision! Either way it\u2019s going to be great!!",

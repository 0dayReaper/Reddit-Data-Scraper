    "postText": "**Housing**\n\nI don't understand why Brown still assigns first-year housing based on *legal sex*, and why even for gender-inclusive housing, you still can't choose the gender of your roommate. Many other colleges allow a student to choose the gender of their roommate. \n\n  \n**Gender marker on the ID card**\n\nIf I [understood correctly](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/lgbtq/transbrown/name-id-email-changes-updates), the only options are male and female, and you can only change it after a legal gender marker change. What???\n\n  \n**Name change**\n\nAdmissions used my correct name for the acceptance letter and the portal so I was thrilled. But then I got my [brown.edu](https://brown.edu) email with my deadname on it... Great. As a first-year student, I won't be able to change it until some time in June. Even then, without going through the lengthy process to change my ID legally, my deadname can still pop up in different places later on.   \n\n\n  \nAnyone else also dealing with these issues? Any advice?",

            "comment": "Hi!\n\nI work at the IT Service Center on campus. Brown is very serious about such issues, and we have several systems in place to deal with this.\n\nFor example, even without a legal name change, you can [change your preferred name](https://ithelp.brown.edu/kb/articles/change-your-preferred-name-in-brown-systems) in many systems on campus. This includes adding an email \u201calias\u201d to your lived name which you can basically use as your primary email address throughout your time here. As far as I\u2019m aware, you don\u2019t necessarily have to wait until June to do these things \u2014 you can send an email to ithelp@brown.edu / start a chat at any time with your request.\n\nIn cases of \u201csensitive\u201d name changes, like yours, you can get even further along in this process if you contact the LGBTQ center.\n\nIn my experience Brown has been one of the most accepting places I\u2019ve been to and I am almost 100% sure you will find other students with similar experiences.",

You could go through SAS for this or maybe talk to res life first.\n\nI just looked at my ID in case I had missed the \u201cgender marker\u201d. I can\u2019t find anything whatsoever indicating a gender. I\u2019m pretty sure that is an internal system identifier.\n\nI think you may have access to banner a bit earlier to change the internal name / email but I\u2019m not sure. All I can say is that you won\u2019t need to communicate with your current email for a while. Additionally, I think once you\u2019ve changed your name and email in Banner no one should see your deadname in any academic interactions. I imagine it could show up in medical forms or other administrative forms.\n\nI wish you the best of luck!",

I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with this -it\u2019s something that we have been trying to work in with the university but they\u2019re being really annoying about it. I highly suggest talking to Kelly (the director of the LGBTQ center) to help sort it out, regardless of if you are a current student. As a previous comment noted -there is a system to change pronouns/names independently but it is a little obtuse. I highly suggest you reach out to the LGBTQ Center! You can also dm for more info or if you would like me to connect you!",

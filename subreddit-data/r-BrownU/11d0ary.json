    "postText": "Hi there! I\u2019m currently a junior in high school so I\u2019ve still got plenty of time before applying to colleges. I absolutely love Boston and I felt especially at home on Northeastern\u2019s campus. But no where has charmed with with its academics like Brown. \n\nI\u2019m interested in premed\u2014do Brown and the area provide good resources if I change my mind? Would it be easy enough for me to switch around my plans and gain experience in a different field? How is Providence for internships/shadowing/research, etc.? (Most likely, though, I\u2019m set on premed) Does anyone have opinions on how well Brown prepares premed students for medical school? \nPs. I\u2019d love to hear thoughts on Northeastern vs Brown premed experience, but that might be niche!\n\nAdditionally, what is life like in Providence? I love Boston. Is Providence a worse city for me to spend my undergrad years in? What\u2019s the social life like?\n\nThanks!:)",

Providence isn\u2019t the most eventful place, but there\u2019s a lot to do on campus (so you rarely leave anyways) and Boston/NYC is an easy commute for long weekends, etc. if you need to be in civilization.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve lived in NYC/SF/LA since graduating. In hindsight, I actually liked not being in a big city during my college years - it was a unique experience that I likely won\u2019t have again.",

I really do think that you can\u2019t go wrong academically/professionally at any of the top schools so I\u2019d strongly consider fit and culture when you choose where to apply ED (obv assuming you\u2019re a competitive applicant).\n\nEdit: To answer your other question, it is actually quite easy to switch majors because of Brown\u2019s Open Curriculum. I knew a few pre-meds who switched to Econ during junior year and they were able to graduate with an AB Econ degree by senior spring! I also knew a lot of PLME kids who dropped out of PLME to pursue finance/tech/etc. (some of these jobs are nearly impossible to get from Northeastern b/c they only interview kids from Ivies/Stanford/MIT/etc.).",

All of my friends agree on this, so we spend our weekends at other places like Newport or Boston usually. I am not premed, so I can't speak on that matter. I can't really speak for internships either because I have not applied or looked into many at the moment. However, networking is possible through career fairs and such.",

Yeah, I do think that when I visited Providence I felt like I could see myself out walking/etc in the town and it would be more enjoyable because it\u2019s more chill there (obviously there\u2019s a downtown too, but I was only there to look at Brown)! I\u2019ll probably head back there sometime and try to see more of the city. Do you have any thoughts on what specifically makes Providence a better place to live? \nAnd what scary parts do you mean that are better in Providence?",

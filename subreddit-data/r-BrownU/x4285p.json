    "postText": "Hey everyone, I'm a freshmen at Brown and I'll be registering for classes later in the day. To put it bluntly, I'm not the best at math, and was wondering if I'll be able to get through this class while not being the best at trigonometry. Later in the day, I do plan on going through Dan Katz Trig. Boot camp, and I'm willing to get tutors and stay for office hours to get a better  understanding of the material. Although I'm willing to do what needs to be done, I like to schedule things a lot. If I do take Math 0090, will it eat too much of my other time for classes if I struggle with trig? For some context, I did take AP Calc and did okay with everything besides trig. Thank you for any responses in advance.",

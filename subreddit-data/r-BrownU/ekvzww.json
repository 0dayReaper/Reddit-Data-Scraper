Also, I'm a Harvard grad and I've never once heard anyone say that Brown is our rival (that's the safety school in New Haven, of course).\n\nIf anything, it's RISD (Rhode Island School of Design), the world-renowned art school right next door.  The only thing artsier than a Brown student is an art school student.  ; )",

I agree with other posters that most Brown students don't view Brown as having a rival, but if they had to pick one it would be Harvard due to its proximity and its reputation",

All the Ivy games are the most important, but particularly Harvard (or probably Cornell for hockey -- their hockey fans were actually the most hostile fans of all I interacted with in my experience)\n\nSource: former Bruno the Bear!

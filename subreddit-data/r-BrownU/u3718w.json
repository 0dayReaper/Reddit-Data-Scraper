I\u2019ve been accepted into the AI track and am planning to attend this fall.\n\nI know this question is asked a lot, but how\u2019s the two class per semester workload? About how many hours per week do you find yourself working on those classes?\n\nHow often are you on campus/how helpful is it to spend a lot of time there? I\u2019m considering how far away from campus I want to live and could use some info on whether I should be expecting to be there every day.",

            "comment": "In my opinion, two courses per semester is a perfect balance. You will have time to revise prerequisites, dive deep into each assignment and do the necessary theoretical study to understand the topics properly and not just \"make the assignments work.\" \n\n\nHours depend on the course. Usually 15~25 hours per week per course. But the course registration system will show the hours reported by the students who have taken the class before. So you will get a rough idea from that. Typically Systems related courses require more work.\n\n\nScM CS students typically use their office while doing the coursework. Easier to use the virtual environment of the course from the department PC and discuss various issues with others. And you can easily attend the in person TA hours.\n\n\nThough it is entirely possible to go through every task from your home, my advice will be to stay at least in college hill within 15-20 minutes of walking distance from campus. \n\n\nLots of in-person events happen at BrownU. If you live far away, you won't be as motivated to attend those and miss a lot of excellent talks from various researchers/professionals and free foods+cultural shows!",

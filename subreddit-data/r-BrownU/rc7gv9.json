I took it my freshman year and did next to nothing for that class on the average week. \n\nEarly Modern Philosophy is also a pretty easy course, but much more work than Food and Philosophy. Longer essays mostly, but it\u2019s also a more interesting course since it\u2019s actually philosophy that you\u2019re learning lol\n\nFor the classes that are on critical review, look at the average time spent per week and the maximum to see which ones are easy. For the ones not on critical review, you gotta just ask people you know who\u2019ve taken philosophy courses which ones were easy",

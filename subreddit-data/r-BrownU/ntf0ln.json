Is there any international student here or one that you know that has gotten a full-ride and essentially has all costs covered?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm planning to apply for econ with a full-ride required but someone just told me that Brown isn't too generous with their aid for internationals and that my chances are bleak. Is this true?",

            "comment": "My understanding (which is limited, as a parent of a first year at Brown), is international students have a difficult time getting financial aid packages if any. I know a student who got rejected from all of his top schools, even though he has amazing credentials, likely because he was requesting financial aid as an international student. \n\nPlease look into whether requesting financial aid as an international student would effect your chances of being accepted. \n\nBrown, and as best I can tell most of not all elite schools, do not give merit based scholarships, as everyone who's accepted would qualify. They only give needs based. I know Vanderbilt (or maybe it was Wash U, or both) did have a few scholarships you could apply for, but I don't think that's the norm.\n\nSecondly look for any scholarship opportunities you can. There are scholarships for anything. Left handed Lithuanian sousaphone players, Jewish biomed students..... See how many scholarships you can cobble together. \n\nLastly, if you're applying to Brown, then you're likely a very talented and accomplished kid, who will contribute much to this world, wherever you end up going to school. Best of luck, and I hope others who are closer to your position correct my errors.",

If they like you, you\u2019d receive the same amount of financial aid regardless of the round you apply to, but I think you\u2019d have a higher chance during the ED round since the selection pool is smaller",

Which comes to roughly about  120 students TOTAL. Of those only a handful probably are on full aid. So yes, given the numbers, brown is not at all generous and it is very common for applicants to Brown to choose to not apply for aid to increase admissions prospects.",

If you wanted to start something though it would not be hard at all because there are so many people here who identify as LGBTQ.\n\nPersonally, I'm not big on participating in LGBTQ things, but I never feel different or separated because of my bisexuality. \n\nIf you want to just fade into the crowd or do the exact opposite, Brown is good for either. Its really what you make of it will shape your experience.",

Unlike homophobic towns, you can dress up however you like n be yourself here :) The reason LGBT groups aren't too active is that there's so many of us that it **feels** like we aren't even a minority here (idk the actual numbers), so most people don't feel the need to look for community in specifically queer spaces- coz the campus itself is a queer space IMO lol",

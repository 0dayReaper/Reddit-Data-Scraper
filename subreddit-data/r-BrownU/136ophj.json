    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m currently a senior deciding between Stanford and brown and I really only have a couple hours left. Can anyone comment on Stanford vs Brown for chemistry undergrad? At Stanford, Ive heard a lot about the bubble, duck syndrome, kinda terrible chem department, inability to retain coursework from short quarter systems, but nice weather, supportive community, rank (lol for chem bc brown is 51 but I\u2019ve heard more positives that will probably do better than rank itself) and great athletics. Yet, I\u2019m not quite sure about their grad focused environment. I\u2019m not pre-med and would like to go into Mat. Sciences/ environment chem! Stanford was around 3k cheaper too if that helps. Thank you so much!\n\nI am honestly leaning towards brown bc of their super collaborative environment, better city, non-competitive clubs, and undergrad focus. Would passing up Stanfords resources and environment be a mistake?",

They\u2019re practically as useful as asking some random guy on the street what they think. \n\nChem here is amazing. As good as Stanford? No, but not worse enough for it to make a tangible difference. It\u2019s true we don\u2019t have many grad schools here, but that\u2019s actually a huge plus. It means professors care more about undergrads and accept more undergrads into their labs for research. I was able to join a lab my first month at Brown because of the undergrad focus.",

Neither school will be lacking for intelligent competition or faculty. If you've got an eye to a specific career trajectory though, you can probably identify which network will be more valuable by answering the above questions.",

I was told by my professor if I do chemistry I\u2019ll instantly win awards (which may be very useful when applying to grad school). So you would in theory have much higher interactions with chemistry teachers here. I think it\u2019s very important to think about what type of undergraduate experience you want. Brown will offer a more undergraduate focused experience, a less stressful environment then Stanford, and grade inflation(we only have A,B, C grades). I think brown is a wonderful school to build a path towards grad school, whereas at Stanford you would be overshadowed by the start up culture students/better know grad school students.",

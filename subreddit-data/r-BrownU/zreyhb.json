    "postText": "For y'all who just got in, Congrats! I've been thinking of making this post for a few years because the same question always inevitably gets asked in the Spring: Will I get rescinded? So hopefully this post can be useful to you and future generations.\n\nOkay for starters, getting rescinded is very difficult to pull off. Basically to be totally safe, don't do anything illegal, use common sense (i.e. don't post something racist/sexist/etc on social media but this is something you shouldn't do anyway for the sake of being a good person), avoid disciplinary issues at school, and keep your grades up. Okay so what does the grades up part mean? To be completely safe and avoid getting a warning letter, I tell people to just get more As than Bs + avoid any Cs. Could you go lower than this? Yeah probably. However, I've never seen people get warning letters following this rule whereas I've seen a few people get warning letters for going lower than that threshold. Better to just be safe.\n\nNow if you're reading this in March or something and you got a warning letter, DO NOT panic. I've now seen and given advice to several people getting warning letters through this sub. For those who don't know, a warning letter is basically as the name implies... A warning letter. It means that if your grades don't improve, the admissions committee technically has the right to review your admissions again and potentially rescind? Will they 100% do it? No, but they have the right if they want to. Anyway, here's how people on this sub have successfully navigated the warning letter process.\n\n1. Do not just sit back and relax. Communicate to your admissions officer and explain the situation. Explain that you're trying your best. This is key. You want to be clear that you are actually trying and don't have senioritis to your admissions officer. If you take anything away from this sub, it's BE COMMUNICATIVE. If you decided to slack off for this first semester of your senior year and you're getting a C, it may. behoove you to send an email to your admissions officer explaining the situation proactively so you can avoid a warning letter altogether.\n2. Talk to your teacher to see if anything can be done. Now if you do all that and still get a C in a class, 99% you'll still be fine bc you followed step1 above but it's best to avoid the scenario altogether for stress mitigation purposes.\n\nRegarding IB predicted vs real discrepancy, I've noticed a few people get screwed on the sub for major discrepancies (prob just dig up in past posts here) but from my observations, don't let it slip too much and you'll be fine.\n\nOkay so you're probably freaking out at this point. PLEASE PLEASE be assured getting rescinded is extremely difficult (especially for grades). This is just a guide so you can be proactive and so you know that others have been in your shoes if you get a warning letter. If you follow this guide, you'll be fine. In terms of unsolicited life advice, I'd recommend focusing on keeping your grades to a manageable, acceptable level (more As than Bs + no Cs) and focus on enjoying senior year. If you were a nerd who hid inside all day, don't be afraid to push your comfort zone. Don't be afraid to go to that dance or hang out with that quirky group of people or do \\[insert whatever\\]. Focus on creating memories that will help you remember hs with a positive note. Maybe try to end any beefs you have with people too (if possible). Good luck and congrats on getting accepted!!!!",

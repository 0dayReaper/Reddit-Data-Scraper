    "postText": "hi all! i\u2019m an incoming first year and i\u2019m starting the process of looking on CAB for courses. I\u2019m interested in public health and/or cognitive science. is there anyone who is concentrating in those who could tell me what their first semester schedule looked like? \n\ncurrently in my non-official cart i have\n- Genetics\n- Mind Brain and Behavior\n- and a FYS\n\nand I was looking at maybe adding Essentials of Data Analysis (PHP 1501 \u2014 is that wise for a freshman?)\n\nAny input is appreciated, thank you so much!!",

            "comment": "I took PHP 1501 my First Year Fall. The TAs were absolutely amazing, and really took the time to explain concepts. The content itself is very similar to AP Stats, except with the addition of R code. However, I'd recommend taking PHP 0310 first, since it's recommended to be taken as a freshmen or sophomore since it (along with PHP 1501) is one of the required courses for the concentration (and is also one of the two intro courses along with PHP 0320).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been recommended to me to take Genetics only after taking Biochemistry since it's helpful to know those topics for the class. If you're looking for a FYS in the Biology department, I'd highly recommend BIOL 0190F: Darwinian Medicine.",

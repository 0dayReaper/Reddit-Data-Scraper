            "comment": "It's hard (impossible?) to get actual credit for it unless you're an actual transfer student. Most profs don't really care about prereqs like math180 or 520 though. I never took either and just email profs for override requests and have gotten one basically 100% of the time. If math180/math520 are concentration requirements then you will have to take 2 extra classes that an advisor approves to replace them. This depends on the advisor but for the most part they are \\*reallly\\* lenient about what counts. I replaced MATH180 with apma2550 and math520 with math1410.",

I\u2019m not aware of a case where the professor didn\u2019t grant the exception to let the student take the class. And if I remember right, the University doesn\u2019t closely pay attention to details of satisfying the degree requirements\u2026.basically if the department advisor approves of the course selection and certifies that it meets the requirements then no one else will ever challenge it and again as this other poster said, they\u2019re very lenient about what counts. I remember an ScB for math requiring some science classes, and I thought it was very clear that they meant science classes outside the math department\u2026.much to my surprise, the advisor said \u201cmath is science too\u201d and signed the form without any further thought\u2026",

Would I have to email each of my profs for an override request or just my department chair? When should I do this? (On a side note, when do advisors reach out to prefrosh?) Planning on double concentrating in CS and APMA-Economics!\n\nThanks for the advice :)",

You should email the professor for each course you need an override for. \n\nIf there's a class with an enrollment cap which requires the courses you're skipping I highly recommend requesting an override early before preregistration starts. In general, I would request an override through both email and CAB, you can just copy and paste a quick sentence or two about how you already took the classes and you feel prepared for the material. I doubt most professors really care since they probably get at least 100 requests of the sort every semester.\n\nIf you find this to be too annoying you can set up a meeting with the relevant department academic dean to try and get placement credits so you're counted internally has having satisfied the prerequisites. Though, I've heard it's an equally annoying process and unlikely if you haven't taken the classes with a university rather than a high school. \n\nNot sure when advisors reach out, but I assume sometime by the end of summer around august. Don't be too worried about the advisor you get, some people get lucky, some people don't. Regardless you're most likely going to be relying on the advisor you choose when declaring your concentration a lot more than the one you're assigned.\n\nIf you have any questions about apma/cs feel free to dm or whatever. I'm studying APMA/CS and Physics.",

            "comment": "I can confirm that the math department doesn't offer a placement test in either course for credit. If either course was a dual-enrollment course (taken at a college while in high school), you could contact Dean Bhattacharyya and apply for placement credit, which would usually only be given if it's ruled a necessity to graduate. But if the courses were not taken at a college, you'd need to either take them again here (which is not ideal unless you think you have something left to learn in the subject) or approach the appropriate people (professors of courses where you need an override because of the prerequisite, or concentration advisors if the course is required for a degree) and ask for exceptions.",

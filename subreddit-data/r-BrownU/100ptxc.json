    "postText": "Hi everyone. I am a student working on a project with Community Partners, a nonprofit based in California, to compare how different campuses across the US are meeting the needs of their disabled and neurodivergent students. If you identify as such, please consider helping by answering a few questions. (This post was mod approved.)\n\nFeel free to reply within this thread or DM me your responses or questions.\n\n1. Are all campus buildings physically accessible to students who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids?\n2. Digital accessibility: Are class session recordings readily available for all large lecture courses?\n3. How much time do students have between consecutively scheduled classes?\n4. Are students required to provide documentation of disability to qualify for receiving initial accommodations?\n5. What is the wait time for an initial appointment with your campus' psychological counseling services?\n6. Is there required diversity and inclusivity training for faculty/staff/and students, and does training include recognition of neurodivergence and disability?\n7. Have you experienced ableism, discrimination, or seen/ heard any stigmatizing language on campus or on the college website?\n8. Does your college offer a Disability Studies curriculum?\n\nPlease DM me if you have any experiences or opinions you would like to share as part of our write-up.\n\nThank you for your time!",

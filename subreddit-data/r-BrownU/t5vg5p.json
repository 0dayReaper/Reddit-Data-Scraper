            "comment": "I did my MPA at Brown and our experience probably isn\u2019t quite the same as other programs because ours is an intensive one year that starts in the summer, so for whatever this is worth - there were not a lot of social opportunities outside of our program. I only met students outside of my cohort because I sought TA positions and served on the GSC. I will say my mentors were very available and willing to make other connections outside our department and with alumni. There\u2019s also the grad bar, which does facilitate some socialization. Good luck with your decision!",

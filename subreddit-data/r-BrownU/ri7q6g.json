    "postText": "ED results are out and I\u2019m offered a place at Brown. However I\u2019m currently experiencing mental health issues and don\u2019t think I have the energy to jump right into college after I\u2019m done with my high school diploma. Does Brown allow for gap years? Has anyone here successfully taken one before attending Brown? How does the application process work? Is mental health an acceptable reason for a gap year? What do I need to do? Thanks in advance",

            "comment": "Please keep in mind the DOJ sued brown because they forced those who took time off for mental health to sign something allowing brown to not take students back and then when they came back brown did not take the students back. If you need a gap year consider other reasons on your application or at least keep in mind what I have just said. Best of luck.\n\nEdit to be clear: they only did this with mental health breaks / gap year for mental health, not for the same breaks for other reasons",

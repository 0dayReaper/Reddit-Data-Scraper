The best thing to do is wait right now :) I fell into the same looking for clues thing, but I do suggest not doing that because it will only cause you to be more anxious. Best of luck :)",

Everybody in my school was talking about those portal myths which actually make people anxious. \n\nThank you for your advice, I'm going to do some meditation and go sleep! Hope I can see you next autumn on brown's campus!",

This is speculation but the withdraw button may just disappear on the day decisions come out because at that point the admissions office spent the time looking at your application an stuff.\n\nOther than that, I totally feel you - when most of your friends are also applying to extremely competitive schools, it can really absorb everything about your conversations, from just casual talk about stress to obsessions with portals. For the sake of your mental health, I wouldn't say to avoid these convos, but maybe try to steer them away! It can be really helpful to talk about things other than college admissions haha.",

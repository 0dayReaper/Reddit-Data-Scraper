I was at ADOCH on Friday and absolutely loved it and could see myself there (I also did pre college last summer and stayed on campus). My only concern is brown\u2019s curriculum and grading system disadvantaging me post-grad. I noticed that Brown students on average make less money 6 years out than the other schools and was hoping someone to could speak to that (source Niche lol). I was also at Penn yesterday and someone told me not to pick Brown bc it\u2019s \u201cnot a real school\u201d and I wouldn\u2019t be able to get into law school with no GPA. Is Brown not the best choice if I want to attend law school and generally be very successful after college? Obviously a Harvard/Yale degree would be more advantageous bc of the name alone but do you guys think the difference is enough to pick them over Brown?",

While Brown won\u2019t calculate your GPA for you on your transcript, you can do it yourself for grad school (and law schools will also calculate it in their own evaluation). I have tons of friends and acquaintances who went to law school after Brown (at Columbia, Penn, UCLA, Cornell, Berkeley, Harvard, George Washington, Yale, NYU, etc). Also, a big part of the reason alum salaries aren\u2019t necessarily ON AVERAGE the highest among other peer schools is because a lot of people go into \u201cpassion work\u201d at lower paying nonprofits, as artists or educators, their own startups (which take time to turn a profit), etc. Plenty of people who care about or need a bigger salary pursue those tracks/career paths and get that juicy paycheck. What you study and ultimately do with the degree matters too. Frankly, these are all great choices/schools. Pick the one you like the best where you think you\u2019ll be happiest. (Personally, I loved it and couldn\u2019t imagine my undergrad years anywhere else \u2014 even though I picked a different Ivy for grad school.)",

My brother learned this after he got into Yale Law school right after undergrad from Brown. The \u201cnot real school\u201d is what people say when they don\u2019t understand HOW the Brown grading scale works.",

Wouldn\u2019t worry about this at all.\n\n2 The person at Penn has no idea what they\u2019re talking about. Harvard Law, etc loves Brown kids and yes we do have a GPA.\n\n3 Prestige at Harvard and Yale is greater, and pursuing those schools is generally \u201csafer\u201d. However, I know many people who\u2019ve chosen brown over those schools because the quality of life is higher, your outcomes are very similar, and getting As is pretty easy lol.\n\nCome to Brown if you really liked it. Life shouldn\u2019t be about optimizing prestige from .002% to .001%",

If you\u2019re swaying to Brown and Yale bc Harvard and Penn are too pre-professional than trust ur gut! Brown graduates generally make less bc there\u2019s a large diversity of fields they go off to (especially in Arts and Education) while Harvard and Yale are feeders to, if not law, then medical and especially consulting fields. Wharton is cracked in its own right. You are not disadvantaging yourself in any way by choosing Brown (which also has an 81% acceptance rate to law schools the last time I saw and was 15 in the US for number of JD Graduates). Personally I also felt like Yale was kind of a stuffy environment for my undergrad which is why I chose brown for ed. Choose what\u2019s best for you :)",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm a newly admitted graduate who will start studying at Brown this fall semester. I'm currently looking for off-campus apartment, and some I like are River House and Center Place. But as I scroll the application page, there seems to be no more room for Center Place right now (only \"add to waitlist\" option) and I also didn't see the application for River House. Generally, when should I begin applying to these apartments? Is it already too late for them?",

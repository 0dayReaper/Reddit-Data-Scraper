Why does Brown choose to label it's master's degrees as Sc.M and not MS (which seems to be the more established terminology)? Also, does it in anyway cause any issues while applying for PhD or industry jobs? Perhaps there is some obvious explanation which I'm missing due to lack of context being an international student.",

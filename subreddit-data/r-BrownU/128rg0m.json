My heart is telling me Brown, but I do not want to jump into any decision. Why did you choose Brown? Pros and Cons? What\u2019s life on campus like? Is choosing Brown over Harvard insane?",

            "comment": "Choosing Brown over Harvard wouldn\u2019t be all that crazy. Remember that they are both incredibly prestigious schools that each have loads of connections that you can take advantage of.\n\nI\u2019d say one of the advantages Brown has is our lack of Gen Ed requirements. Basically, you don\u2019t have to take classes like \u2018English 101\u2019 or \u2018History of the World\u2019 to graduate. You can leap right into your chosen major and start on it right away. This also frees up space to take a wider range of classes exploring new things and broadening your horizons, which is something I\u2019d always suggest.\n\nThere\u2019s a myth that academics here are relaxed because of the Open Curriculum. This is a lie. Classes are still extremely rigorous and challenging and plenty of very intelligent people can find themselves struggling and being swamped with work. We just have more options to help manage that stress. A shopping period at the beginning of the semester gives you a trial run on classes before you fully commit to them, allowing you to add and drop classes with no penalty. If you drop a class at any point in the semester, it doesn\u2019t show up in your external transcript. You can also take classes Pass/Fail, though I would suggest doing this sparingly.\n\nBrown also allows you to create an independent major. If you have a very specific area of study that you don\u2019t feel like any existing concentration covers, you can work with an academic advisor to create your own.\n\nLife on campus is also nice. The area is truly beautiful and Brown is known for having some of the most welcoming students",

Something most people don\u2019t talk about but is a huge difference, is that Brown is catered towards Undergraduate education. Many professors here care about teaching, not just research or chasing a Nobel prize. We do of course have some Nobel laureates, but I\u2019ve heard many stories from my colleagues at Harvard how their professors seemed to rest on their laurels or seemed disinterested in lecture since their main purpose/mission at Harvard was research. Just speaking from personal experience, I\u2019ve roamed Harvard\u2019s campus and many students just seem, depressed, or stressed out. I think it\u2019s an extremely competitive culture there, where people at Brown are just more excited to be around other smart people. Hope that helps",

                    "comment": "Things to do:\nQuite a lot if you\u2019re new to the northeast. During the fall, a lot of people take the RIPTA (a great bus line free for Brown students) to Newport. If you like bike riding, theres this beautiful bike path along the Narragansett Bay that allows you to see a lot of old expensive houses. Providence also has a lot of great restaurants to try, most notably Italian if you have the money for it. Sometimes, the city lights some torches along the river near RISD and plays some music, which I\u2019d recommend seeing at least once. The bar scene downtown is pretty great if that\u2019s your cup of tea once you\u2019re 21. A lot of great burger joints to eat late at night (Jrs, Haven Brothers, Olneyville, etc.). There\u2019s a train that takes you to Boston in an hour. The outing club here sponsors trips to cool places in the northeast if you wanna make friends. There\u2019s plenty to do if you have the money. But after your first year, all of that shit gets old and you worry more about school work because Brown is hard af.\n\nDining halls:\nI visit cafeterias around the country as a hobby. The main dining hall sucks. All of them are overpriced ($20/swipe\u2026 wtf). RISD has a lot better food for less. If you want good food in the northeast, go to Yale or UMass. Brown also underpays a lot of the workers here from what I hear.\n\nProvidence:\nI honestly love this city. Entertainment is cheap, and people are funny af when you talk to them. College Hill (and Providence in general) is very safe when it comes to violent crime, but if you leave your shit out in the open inside ur car or an open window, don\u2019t be surprised if it becomes someone else\u2019s. Normal common sense stuff.\n\nCollaborative:\nIt depends on the department. Engineering classes felt super collaborative. Applied math classes didn\u2019t. I think the open curriculum and lack of curves outside of the econ department fosters a more collaborative atmosphere. Keep in mind, however, that ur still going to go to a school that attracts some of the most competitive students in the country.",

            "comment": "It really depends on what you want to do post-college and how much of a \u201cculture fit\u201d you are at each school. I know folks who chose Brown over HYP (or even transferred to Brown from these schools) and am also close with a lot of people who went to those schools (SO went to H, brother went to P). I think all of us are doing quite well post-college and would\u2019ve ended up in the same place regardless of which \u201ctop college\u201d we attended, but I definitely look back at my college experience the most fondly (they both hated it). Besides the social aspect, the open curriculum, grade inflation, lax grading system, easy classes, etc. helped make the whole experience much more enjoyable as well.\n\nOne important consideration though is if you are interested in pursuing finance, then do not choose Brown. I would even suggest choosing a lower-ranked institution (Stern/UVa/Ross/etc.) if getting a Wall Street job is your end-all be-all \u2014 finance recruiting at Brown is quite weak (worst among Ivies by far)\u2026 I (and most my friends) had to put in more than 2x the work to get to the same end result. That said, there\u2019s a lot more to college than getting a finance job so just my $0.02.",

So I was like, what\u2019s worse than going to Brown is spending $56,000\n\nI had that exact same feeling at Brown of being suffocated right when I stepped on campus. I\u2019m convincing myself that I can just do study abroad\u2019s so I don\u2019t have to be on that campus",

Applied to Brown, and my HS coach told me he knew the coach at Brown, and would send a letter to support my application for admission (I was not recruited by Brown athletics).\n\nI got into Brown, and told my HS coach, and thanked him for supporting my application. He said, \"Oh shit - I totally forgot! Sorry, I never contacted anyone there.\"\n\nThe good news was, I got into Brown on my own power. The bad news: I showed up at soccer practice that fall and participated in two days of tryouts/practice, as a walk on. I was SO out of my league, I quietly disappeared from the soccer crowd. Played rugby instead, and loved it!",

    "postText": " \n\nHi,\n\nI'm applying to Brown and had a question regarding the electives for the Data Fluency Undrgrad Certificate.\n\nThe course description enlists Computer Science as one of the excluded concentrations. Does this mean CS Undergrads arent allowed to pursue the certificate or does it simply mean we have to choose electives that aren't CS-related like BIOL1555 or EEPS1320?\n\nAppreciate any input\ud83d\udc4d",

            "comment": "Yup it means that certain undergrads who are concentrating in the excluded concentrations can't pursue the Data Fluency Certificate. \n\nIt's kinda like a data fluency/computer science minor - you can't really minor in the subject you're already majoring in.",

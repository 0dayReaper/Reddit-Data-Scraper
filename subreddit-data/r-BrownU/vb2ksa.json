The r/ApplyingToCollege reddit has a wiki page on [writing essays](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/wiki/essays/) that I'd recommend looking at - main advice I'd have when it comes to writing the Brown essays is make sure you're writing about your own experiences in high school that got you interested in x or y field and why specifically being at Brown will help you achieve your goals (e.g. the Open Curriculum lets me study engineering and english, I want to do research in this area of public health that Brown's known for, I want to get involved with this on-campus group etc.)",

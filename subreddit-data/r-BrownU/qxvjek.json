The only things you need to know for interviews are taught in APMA 1650 (and maybe 1200).  \n\nYou\u2019ll be fine without grad real analysis, although a lot of proofs use functional analysis (i remember arzela ascoli and riesz representation were used a lot - random variables are just functions after all). But if you\u2019re ok getting less out of the class then it\u2019s fine to go in a little less prepared. What\u2019s your analysis background?",

I'll start with a butchered quote from a friend: \"... you \\*\\*\\*\\*, the pre-requisite to *graduate* math courses is an *undergraduate* degree in mathematics.\" His point was direct, but my point is primarily that you should not be looking at these courses like you looked at AP courses in high school. The content is indeed useful and it will indeed look nice on your resume, but you are in no way the intended audience; those courses are there to serve as a gateway to working towards expertise on a very particular topic. If you took AP stat in HS, 1650/5 was probably very easy --- at least, this is what I've heard from a number of my math-oriented friends. 1200 may have been similar.\n\n\\&gt; Tho it requires grad real analysis and I wonder if at that point you are better off just reading the relevant textbook.\n\nThis gives me the feeling that the way we look at this is completely different: in particular, I think you're looking at it as a *probability* sequence, not a *probability theory* sequence. That nuance is huge and is essentially true for the rest of the classes you listed. If you just want the job, take math1610/20. Otherwise, at least take 1130 so that the analysis topics aren't completely brand new to you, otherwise you're not going to have a fun time. That being said, RFT is not as hard of a pre-req as it might seem, and functional analysis is left entirely to the second semester, so you don't miss much there. It would be very much beneficial for you to know how Lebesgue integration/ measure theory and that all works before that sequence.\n\nFor the others, I don't have too much to say since I have taken them yet (I'm currently in RFT and a2550 + some monkey CS garbage; next semester is the continuations + a2610. Not til next year that I'll take the probability sequence), but the general principle is true: \"yes, it's helpful to have the knowledge. No, I do not believe that the winning strat is to take a ton of grad courses\"\n\nThis is incomplete but already quite long. I'll end with pointing out that the previous SIG/ Jane Street/ IMC/ Five Rings interns I've met here have not taken many graduate courses, if any at all --- though these were all traders. Of course, the process for SWE is very different, and you probably *should* try to take these all over the course of your years here if you want to do quant research, since those roles are much more intimate with ML, optimization, and modeling.\n\nTake your time though. 3 grad courses + 2 CS that people tout as taking up a ton of time was simply not conducive to having time for interview prep like most of my peers do. Not sure what year you are, but recognize that QR as a sophomore is, well, highly improbable, mostly for reasons out of your control. Most of these places do take sophomores for the trading positions, but not for SWE or Research, maybe barring the complete phenoms getting headhunted.",

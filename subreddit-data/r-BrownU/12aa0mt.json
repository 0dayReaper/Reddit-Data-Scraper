    "postText": "Hey everyone, \n\nI recently got accepted to Brown, and I'm going to be concentrating in CS, but the one reason I want to utilize the Open Curriculum is to take CAD/Electronics/Engineering classes to feed my hobby for the creation of electronics/robots without majoring in ECE and going too deep into this.\n\n**My question is:** How are the aforementioned classes like at Brown? Are they good, on par with other institutions of this caliber, or somewhat lacking?\n\nAlso, how are the facilities provided (In general but mainly for Engineering students)? Are they new?\n\nIs there a makerspace on campus? What does it have in it? Would I be able to build robots there? I saw the Brown Design Workshop but I'm not too sure if that's the makerspace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "Congrats on your acceptance! I'm a current sophomore studying computer engineering, so hopefully I'm qualified to help.\n\nI'd recommend ENGN30 freshman fall to get a feel for engineering at Brown. It tends to lean more theoretical, but you spend a lot of time in the BDW designing, printing, and building (2.5 hours per week are required but you'll end up spending more than that for projects). I would definitly consider the BDW to be the primary makerspace on campus, there are plenty of machines for most everything you could want. I'm sure you'd find a way to build robots there. ENGN500 might also be up your alley, I haven't taken it but I know several EE people that have enjoyed it.\n\nThere's also plenty in the CS department that might interest you. The Humans to Robots Lab on the first floor of the CIT is where the majority of the robotics stuff is on campus, many professors and students use that space for research (from my understanding it's more software oriented than hardware though). There are also CS courses that lean into the hardware, including a class where you build and program a drone.\n\nI've only attended Brown so I can't speak for other institutions, but I've never found Brown to be lacking when it comes to engineering and CS. CS is the biggest concentration by far and is (in my humble opinion) the best CS you can get as an undergrad. Engineering has been getting huge amounts of funding over the past few years, with tons of new and updated equipment that any student is allowed to use (given proper training where applicable).\n\nI personally chose Brown over multiple top engineering schools, including Georgia Tech, and I know many others here that did the same. Everyone I've talked to feels they made the right decision coming here. Hopefully this helps!",

                    "comment": "Thank you so much for such a detailed response! I really appreciate it! \n\nI'm very glad you're enjoying your time at Brown and chose it over other schools (I myself am looking at Brown vs. other schools like GT, UIUC, etc.), but Brown is my top choice right now because of the Open curriculum.\n\nI have maybe one or two more questions about engineering, though: \n\n1) I'm guessing there is a very good amount of theory in engineering classes, but as maybe a percentage, how much of the time is spent doing something in the real world (programming a drone, 3D printing, etc) vs. theory?\n\n2) This Might not be the smartest question, but, I am planning on using the Open Curriculum to take mainly (like 90%) CS/Engineering courses mainly because I am interested in literally all types of engineering (Mechanical, Electrical, Computer, all of them). Do you know other people that are kind of like that - staying in basically just STEM? Because looking at other people going into Brown a lot of them are doing some science and then something in the humanities department.\n\nThank you again!",

                            "comment": "1) Heavily depends on the course imo. Engn30 and 40 are pretty project heavy and you spend a good amount of time in the BDW, whereas Engn510 you spend no time in the BDW and under 10 hours total in the electronics lab (510 is electricity and magnetism btw). Not sure if I can break it into a percentage, but the first year of courses gives you enough to be confident in the BDW, then some engineers decide they want to spend more time in there outside of courses. There's certainly no limit to the amount of time you can spend in the BDW and I'd say that applying theory from class in your own time is a very valuable experience. Also, we have a CS class that is all about building drones if that's something you're interested in, plus I'm sure there are multiple labs that utilize them. We also do plenty of 3D printing first semester and you're easily able to get certified to print whenever you want.\n\n2) There's certainly a mix of both! I have an engineering friend that takes as many humanities as possible, and many more friends that absolutely refuse to take any humanities classes. After this semester, only 3/17 of my credits will be from non-stem courses, and I many know people where that number will easily be 0/16+ by taking writing designated STEM classes (for example, my roommate is taking a proof writing math course that counts as his writing requirement, he is one of the 0/16 people). To be clear, the writing requirement is two classes total over four years and is generally not something people have to stress over. Humanities are subtly encouraged, but the open curriculum truly is open!",

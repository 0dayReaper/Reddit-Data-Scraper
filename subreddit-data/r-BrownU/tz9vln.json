    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI got into Barnard College of Columbia University as a [Scholar of Distinction](https://barnard.edu/scholars-of-distinction) (I think it is around 5ish in the incoming class), which has many interesting benefits such as two years of paid research (can be in any form) under the guidance of a mentor of my choice on top of other things.\n\nI also got into Brown. I was deferred ED but got in RD, so I am not bound by anything. If a program similar to the Barnard one exists, and they are taking applications, please let me know!\n\nNow, my parents are suggesting Brown simply because it is more selective (5% vs 8%) and has a \u201c\u201dbetter reputation\u201d\u201d. They are also concerned about Barnard\u2019s alumni network. We have a lot of Brown alumni in the area (I\u2019m an international student) Now, everyone else is suggesting Barnard because of the Scholars of Distinction thing. I am truly split.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your insight. I\u2019ve also posted this to the Columbia subreddit to see what they have to say.\n\nEdit: I chose Brown! Thank you for the advice :)",

I am an international student from a small Western European country, so Providence is around the size of the city closest to me (which is the biggest city in my region).",

There\u2019s also plenty of research opportunities on Campus because of how small the grad school network is. As for social justice, Brown is a bit notorious for having an administration that is not easily swayed by the student body. I\u2019m an ED admit myself who is incredibly passionate about social justice, and that\u2019s part of the reason I picked Brown. I felt my experiences and passions would be most helpful in Brown\u2019s campus, where quite a few students are incredibly passionate about their respective movements and are always innovating the way they approach their administration. If you wanna chat feel free to PM me, but I think Brown would really benefit from having you on campus :)",

Second great taste in mixtapes. \n\nAs a brown alum from somewhere other the NE, I found Providence to be a big unexpected benefit. \n\nPros compared to NYC ( where I moved to and have lived after grad school)\n- walkable\n- great food and nightlife\n- small enough to be manageable and familiar\n- good housing\n- very affordable\n- 45 min to Boston, 3.5 hrs by train to NYC\n- Campus is really integrated into the east side\n- fantastic engaged arts community. \n\nCons compared to NYC \n- not an international arts destination\n- not a world class theatre venue\n- not a truly integrated large metropolis with core long term institutions.\n\nMy hot take though, is that I found Brown to be an exceptional place to be a student, largely because the city and the university where both intertwined and integrated. Interested in social policy? Brown faculty and the school are engaged at the city level and you can make contributions as an undergrad. Interested in art and architecture? The RISD museum is a great resource and Brown\u2019s art history faculty are exceptional at supporting students. Curious about radio? I may be dating myself but brown had two radio stations; one that was engaged and run almost as a for profit radio and a student radio station in Faunce. \n\nThere is a strong international community at the school. I\u2019d encourage you to break out of that group and enjoy your unit if you choose Brown.\n\nEdit: grammar.",

(There's  plenty at Brown)",

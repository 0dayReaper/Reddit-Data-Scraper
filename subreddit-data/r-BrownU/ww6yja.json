    "postText": "So I ordered something from Walmart and it was just dropped off to mailing services in a Walmart bag. I\u2019m just finding out though that Brown doesn\u2019t accept mail or packages from 3rd party vendors and I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re gonna do with it. Any advice?\n\nEDIT: I emailed mailing services for them to tell me that they don\u2019t know where the package disappeared to\u2014basically stolen. I called Walmart and told them of my situation and they gave me a full refund. Happy ending",

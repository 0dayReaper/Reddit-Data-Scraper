He was very responsive to student concerns, incredibly knowledgeable, and made sure the class was interesting and actually would change subjects to encompass more student interest!\n\nPHP 320 wasn't necessary at all for the course, but PHP 310 is. He assumed we remembered a lot from the health care course, particularly the different ways people are insured (Medicare, HMOs, PPOs, etc.). I think if you take 310 in the fall and 650 in the spring, you'll do just fine! The assignments were very straightforward (there was also hardly any at all!), and the final was a choice between a presentation or paper on a novel drug treatment of your choosing (from a provided list). The class isn't too demanding, but if I had any critiques, they would be that the midterms were outrageously long (about 50 multiple choice) and that some weeks had too many readings.\n\nI hope this helps, but I'd be happy to answer any more questions!",

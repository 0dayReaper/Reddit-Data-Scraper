            "comment": "Some classes, especially big intro ones like MATH 180, have multiple sections denoted by S01 and S02 and so on. If you click the different sections you'll see that they have different meeting times, for example with MATH 180 S01 being at 11AM while S02 is at 1PM.\n\nSome classes also have extra required sessions called conferences, denoted by the C01 and C02. When you are picking classes, you will also have to choose one of the conference sections if they are listed on [courses@brown](https://cab.brown.edu/). These are also usually at different times, again using MATH 180 as an example where C01 is at 9AM while C02 is at 12PM. I hope this helps!",

For instance a class might have basic class sections (S01, S02\u2026) but also lab sections (L01, L02\u2026) or conference sections (C01, C02\u2026). \n\nYou can only register for one of each part at a time, and if you don\u2019t register for all parts of a course you will get an error in C@B. Make sure that during registration for any class with multiple letters in the sections you have one and only one of each and every letter for your courses selected in your primary cart or you\u2019ll have to scramble to fix it.",

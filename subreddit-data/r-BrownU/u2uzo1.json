    "postText": "**TLDR; Can you tell the difference between a tank and an APV? DM me. No? Still DM me.**\n\nOur    project needs short-term volunteers (no skills or money required) to    help build a database to train a machine learning algorithm that will    contribute to our overall project of tracking Russian military  movements   in Ukraine. We need individuals to help us with the  following tasks:\n\n1. Identify images of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers and military equipment.\n2. Collect images featured in Russian propaganda.\u00a0\n\nThe    individuals volunteering to sort images of soldiers and military    equipment will be provided an easy crash course by the verification team    lead (me). Here is an example of the material that will be covered in    the crash course: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f7Xa-r5yXo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f7Xa-r5yXo).    Volunteers will be provided images and clearly marked folders in  which   to sort them.\u00a0Military knowledge helpful but not necessary.  \nThe    atrocities committed by Russian forces every day are testament to the    need for efficient and reliable real-time tracking of Russian troop    movements for the safety of Ukrainian civilians. Please help by  donating   some of your time. Even as little as a couple hours would be  helpful.   It\u2019s possible to volunteer remotely any day of the week, but  we usually   meet at 10pm over Zoom. **I  am  also a college student in Boston, and our team consists of college   students and subject field experts in the US and Europe. DM me if   interested!!!**",

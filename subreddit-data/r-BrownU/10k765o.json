    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI was recently admitted to Brown University for a masters program but I am having a hard time trying to figure out if I should bring my car. I am from Florida and I am on my parents insurance policy. I only plan to stay in RI for &lt;1 year since I was admitted to a medical school in a different state for the following year (starting medical school in 2024). Do I need to get my own insurance or can I stay on my parents? One of my co-workers went through something similar and said they had to upgrade their Florida insurance policy to match the minimum of the state they moved too (co-worker was also on parents insurance). For example, Florida insurance has to cover a min. of $10,000 of the cost of the accident but the state they moved too has to cover a min. of $250,000. I know that Providence is small and I can probably survive with a bike, but wanted to explore all my options. Any information provided about this would be useful!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: If anyone is curious about insurance cost; my quote from Geico was about $1200 for the year. I am in my mid-20s and don't have an accident history. The $1200 also included renters insurance.",

            "comment": "I've lived in Providence for seven of the past eight years for my PhD. I have never found myself wishing I owned a car. If you really need to be in a motor vehicle, it's incredibly easy to do so without the hassle of owning your own. If you do bring one, be prepared to pay a lot for on street parking, and to deal with the damage wreaked by winter salt. \n\nAs a Brown student, you'll get a steep discount on a Zipcar membership, which will allow you to easily rent cars all over the city with just a few taps in an app.\n\nWhile you are a student, Brown also pays for the cost of riding the bus. Just swipe your Brown ID. It goes all over Rhode Island. \n\nIn the evenings, when you're coming home from a bar drunk, you can order Brown's On Call shuttle \u2014 it's like Brown's private Uber, but free. \n\nBy signing up for Brown Market Share, you'll be able to pick up most of your groceries from on campus. The rest can be easily gotten by walking or bicycle. I usually just walked, but for larger trips, I bought paniers to carry groceries on my bicycle.\n\nFor trips to Boston, skip the car entirely. On weekends, roundtrip train tickets are only $10, and exploring Boston without the stress of driving is a delight.\n\nLastly, I'll add that Providence's bicycle culture is a hidden gem of the city. It's only in the past year I've actually gotten into it, but it's been a source of tremendous joy. It's a great way to experience the city on a human scale, and meet cool people.",

The potholes and road salt here really does fuck cars up. Overnight street parking requires an expensive pass, too. \n\nIf you only plan to use your car for rare emergencies, you should estimate whether it'd be cheaper to just Zipcar or Uber in those situations.",

It will likely come in handy for groceries (and miscellaneous furniture pickup, Target/Walmart shopping). It will be most useful for getting out of the Brown bubble from time to time and traveling around. Exploring different parts of PVD, hitting Newport and other RI beaches in the warmer months, maybe even drive to Boston if the train timings aren't working out for you. These things will help you take a break and immensely benefit your well-being.\n\nI would recommend keeping a car, chances are you will also have friends who will be glad you have it.",

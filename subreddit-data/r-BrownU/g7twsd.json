Brown Esports just launched our **survival server for Minecraft** yesterday (4/25)!  https://i.imgur.com/1qtkFYE.jpg this was a really cool screenshot of our online player log!  \n\nWe\u2019re the student organization behind the replica of Brown University covered by [Brown News](https://www.brown.edu/news/2020-04-13/minecraft) and [the Brown Daily Herald](https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/04/08/minecraft-model-browns-campus-students-cultivate-community/).  \n\nTo join:\n\n1.\tIn Java Edition of Minecraft, join our server at mc.brownesports.org\n2.\tWhen you join, you\u2019ll be on the replica of Brown University.  From here, punch the lad that says Survival Server\n3.\tPoof, you\u2019ll be brought to the survival spawn!  From here, run straight in any direction and then drop down, and you\u2019ll be able to get going :D\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it.  Since it\u2019s a completely fresh server, now\u2019s the best time to join!  The server is also open to people who don\u2019t go to Brown, so anyone can play.  **There are also a LOT of Class of 2024 folks grinding out Minecraft,** so if you\u2019re new to Brown, this is the perfect way to find new pals immediately :D\n\nFor voice comms &amp; general discussion, we use discord, which you can join here: http://discord.gg/brown.  Our discord has over 800 people now, and isn\u2019t just Minecraft! \n\n**TL;DR:** Join Brown Esports\u2019 Survival Server at mc.brownesports.org.",

We originally got funding from UFB for basic hosting from BeastNode, but we reached out to the CS department, and they were more than happy to work with us in getting everything setup.  We have 32gb of ram &amp; pretty good CPUs to split between our replica of Brown &amp; the survival server, so it should be a good time.  \n\nIt\u2019s pretty hype to have Brown CS help us out haha",

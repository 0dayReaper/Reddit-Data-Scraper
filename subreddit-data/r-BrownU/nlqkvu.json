    "postText": "On Brown's website ([https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/degree-guidelines-0/college/](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/degree-guidelines-0/college/)) it says this:\n\nMany students often wonder how magna cum laude is calculated since Brown does not compute a GPA (grade point average). What follows is the logic employed to determine magna cum laude honors at Brown University:\n\n\\-Each student is assigned a normal load based on the number of tuition/enrollment units a student has in residence at Brown. For most students this normal load is 32.0 (4 courses x 8 semesters) if they are enrolled for 8 semesters in residence at Brown and do not take summer courses or study elsewhere, etc.\u00a0\n\n \\-The second part of the calculation is to take all graduating students who are actually completing their requirements for commencement in May and take their total number of magna-eligible grades (grades of A or S with distinction \\[Note: S\\* on transcript means mandatory S/NC grade option not S with distinction. Distinction marks are not released outside the University as they are used strictly for magna calculation purposes\\]) and divide based on specific student's normal load to come up with a magna percentage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes this mean Brown just takes the number of A's someone receives and divides it by 32 (assuming they were there 8 semesters)? So, for example, if one were to have taken 35 classes with 33 A's, their percentage would be a 33/32 = 103%? Essentially rewarding those who took 5 classes (and did well on them)?",

            "comment": "\"Likewise, if a student did enroll in Brown summer courses these are added on a 1:1 basis to his/her normal load. So in the case of a student who enrolled for 8 semesters and also enrolled in two Brown summer courses the normal load would be 34.0 ((4.0 X 8) + 2). For students who came in as transfer students and/or took a semester abroad their normal load would be decreased by the number of semesters that were credited as a result of transfer credits (ex. 6 semesters in residence fulltime the normal load would be 24.0 (4 courses x 6)).\"\n\nBased on this statement on the same page, it looks like any additional courses beyond the normal 32 enrollment units are added to the denominator. Fall and Spring semester courses are not specified, but I don't see why this would only apply to summer courses. To me, this just seems like an elaborate way of saying, \"honors are awarded based on GPA.\" The only catch is that GPAs are not officially shown anywhere, so students will have to calculate it themselves.",

They seem to emphasize the fact that 8 semesters == 32. If they were just gonna add every course you took, why did they phrase it so complicated.\n\nAnyway none of this really matters, I'm just curious that's all.",

                            "comment": "Right -- the whole explanation is a bit vague, especially with the \"normal load\" at 32 credits being so emphasized.\n\nBut if we were to assume that the language used in this sentence, \"\\[f\\]or most students, this normal load is 32.0 if they are enrolled for 8 semesters in residence at Brown and do not take summer courses or study elsewhere, etc\", is precise, then this also suggests that there are some students whose normal load is not 32. Now, Brown requires at least 32 to graduate, so this can only mean that some students can have more than 32 if they took more than 4 in a given semester, since they say \"most\" students, not \"all\" students.\n\nI think the reason why 32 is so emphasized is that most students who do take 5 courses in a given semester compensate for this by taking 3 during another semester, thereby still having 32 in total.\n\nIt could be that Brown's GPA calculation system is different from others, given this vagueness in their language. But I just don't see why that would take a more complicated route by setting a fixed denominator for all students, instead of simply counting the number of credits that each student has. They're either just odd or trying really hard to not sound like they're essentially calculating a GPA for their students when Brown's officially known as a school that doesn't calculate it.",

It\u2019s a really fantastic program. You choose one of three tracks- I\u2019m doing policy and governance. The electives are amazing. You can substitute out one of the quant/qualitative methods requirements by taking a language. I\u2019m taking French and plan to do an internship abroad next spring. It should transfer back in at least for a couple IAPA electives.\n\nPast that, the Watson institute, which houses the IAPA concentration, is always holding events and the faculty are so helpful. The building is really nice too.",

If you Google IFE paris you can find it and look at the other cities if that\u2019s something that interests you. I bet they have them for other languages too under different programs. Btw this isn\u2019t specific to the IAPA program, it\u2019s an independent National program that partners with Brown.",

And they\u2019re targeted toward the country\u2019s politics and history, culture, how to be an employee there etc. then the internship starts after that and it counts as a fourth class because you have to write a 15-20 page thesis on a topic of your choosing related to the internship. All of those credits transfer back into Brown as unassigned credits, and then you can file to have them count as IAPA electives which I know at least two of them can.",

I wouldn\u2019t recommend going abroad in your first year anyway just because it puts more pressure on your to finish your requirements later in your college timeline. Plus, there will be info sessions for all sorts of opportunities on campus, and you really want to make sure you go to those, talk to peers and advisors, and craft a plan that\u2019s good for you personally.\n\nBTW you can take a look at the course list if you Google IAPA requirements, my personal favorite elective so far has been Understanding the Middle East. And you can also Google statistics for what IAPA concentrators have gone on to do after school. I wish I could remember what that page was called.",

You can definitely try it, but I made it about 75% of the school year before a mental breakdown caused me to quit most of my part time work. Trying to balance both is possible, but you're going to miss out on so much on campus and if you happen to have a particularly heavy semester it's just not sustainable.

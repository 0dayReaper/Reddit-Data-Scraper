    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nI am an incoming freshman with an interest in the business aspects of the entertainment/film industry, and I'm eager to understand the landscape of opportunities within this field at Brown.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any insights that could be shared by Brown student filmmakers, alumni working in this sector, or anyone with relevant knowledge on the subject. Thanks in advance!\n\n* *What is the experience like navigating the entertainment industry as a Brown student?*\n\nDrawing from prior conversations, I have gathered that hands-on, practical experience is often highly valued in the entertainment industry, sometimes even more than the academic degree itself. Thus, college internships and establishing a network within film studios can significantly enhance career prospects. While Brown's Ivy League status undeniably opens doors across diverse industries, allowing students to secure interview opportunities and avoid resume oversights, I'm curious about its specific influence in the entertainment world. Could anyone share their experiences on how entertainment industry recruiters perceive resumes from Brown students?\n\n* *Networking with Brown Alumni in the industry*\n\nAs I understand it, In an industry as interconnected as entertainment, alumni networking plays a pivotal role. I'm interested to learn about the extent of Brown's alumni presence in the entertainment industry, particularly on the business side. Additionally, could you share some insights into the alumni response culture? Specifically, how responsive are they typically to students reaching out for connections and advice?\n\n* *Other general industry resources*\n\nMy online research led me to the Ivy Filmfest, an impressive student-led initiative. I am intrigued to know about other resources, programs, or organizations within Brown that aim to cultivate networks and connections within the industry. Could anyone recommend any such resources that could be advantageous for an aspirant like me?\n\nI sincerely appreciate any guidance or insights you could provide. Your experiences and advice will be invaluable in shaping my path at Brown and beyond.",

            "comment": "Hey! Welcome to Brown!\n\nBrown Motion Pictures(Bmp)is another student club that I'd consider looking into! Having worked on 2 films, I'd say the club is incredibly hands on and helps you pick up skills really fast. They have roles for producers that do get fairly involved with the business side of things. Additionally, the E-Board positions in the club are great for diving deeper into the production and business aspects of the entertainment industry.\n\nAs for networking, iff and Bmp can both be great resources. Reaching out to alumni is also a great strategy and they are quite responsive. I'd highly recommend checking out the career labs networking events as the alumni that participate in them are actively looking to connect with students. In my experience, they were far more responsive than other alumni.\n\nDo lemme know if I can elaborate on any of these resources! Hoping to see you at these clubs and maybe even on a film set :)",

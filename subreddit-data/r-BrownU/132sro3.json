    "postText": "ADOCH was one the funnest days of my life. I understand that the student body isn't as pre-professional as some of the other ivies (Penn, Columbia), and I actually really like that about Brown, but have you felt that if there was a bit more pre professionalism on campus you might've been exposed to more opportunities/career paths? That you would've had more OCR on campus/opportunities available to you? I'd really enjoy my 4 years at Brown, but I'm worried that coming out of it, I might end up regretting not going to a more job-focused school.",

There are plenty of pre-professional clubs, societies, and opportunities to supplement your classroom learning. You\u2019ll find other students, groups, and resources oriented toward the same pre-professional goals as you are.",

            "comment": "A different POV from someone who graduated 46 years ago. Why are you worried about professions so soon? I made that mistake and wound up being unhappy with my job for most of my life. \n\n1) Why are you worried about 4 or 5 years from now? If I read this right, you\u2019re a sub-frosh. One of the wonderful things about Brown is the opportunity to explore. Do it with a vengeance. Don\u2019t become a one trick pony. Find some area that you\u2019ve always had a secret interest in and explore. Astronomy to Zoology, or dabble in lots of different areas to discover what you really like. \n\n2) Brown will not be a mistake. Regardless of what you decide to concentrate in, mention Brown and folks will assume you\u2019re brilliant in whatever you\u2019re looking at doing. And some alum is already doing it and most likely be willing to help you. \n\n3) Brown is a friendly place.  I was never good at making lots of friends, but I made some lifelong friendships at Brown. Everyone is in the same boat. \n\n4) Most importantly, don\u2019t choose your life because of finances. You will be spending 1/3 to 1/2 of your life doing it (That\u2019s the least amount of time.) Choose something you\u2019re passionate about. You will be better doing that than anything else because you want to do it. You\u2019ll look forward to working. Someone once told be that if you\u2019re passionate about what you\u2019re doing, the money will follow.  There\u2019s a difference between want and need. That\u2019s true for the things that money can buy and the things it can\u2019t. As soon as you get a thing you want, you\u2019re usually bored with it. But the  things we need, we don\u2019t tire of. Check out Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. (I know about it because I took Psych I at Brown.\ud83e\udd13) \n\nThis is only my advice, Take whatever you want and forget about the rest of it. Good luck!",

            "comment": "It seems you're a CS major, which makes this a little confusing. Brown has one of the most rigorous CS programs among the ivies, and it reflects in the opportunities. Brown's median starting salary for CS graduates is $141,000 which if I remember is the highest in the world, and mid-career salaries are about the same as Carnegie, MIT, and Stanford. Brown is one of the most easy funnels into the tech and startup sector, half the time you can just mention you went here and they'll assume you're for a top-level position. Most people who don't go here don't realize this because it's seen as an arts-focused Ivy, which is hilariously wrong. \n\nThere are some common misconceptions about this school. People seem to mistakenly apply the \"laid-back,\" \"open,\" and \"chill\" words to the academics themselves instead of just the social scene. Yes Brown is a chill place - not the classes. Your classes will be hard as fuck, and if you're doing CS they're some of the hardest on the planet, this is still an Ivy League school and the jobs and internships network is absolutely insane. Brown is also rigorously STEM-focused in terms of student body, funding, etc., another thing that surprises new students but has been a mainstay for a very long time now. The difference with Brown is that it doesn't only do STEM well, it does almost everything well, and you're supposed to learn more than just your major. From Brown's perspective, why focus on only one thing when you're guaranteed to be among the best no matter what, you might as well learn what you actually care about in life on top of it. That is how you end up with a college with insane academics and a laid back social atmosphere and freedom.",

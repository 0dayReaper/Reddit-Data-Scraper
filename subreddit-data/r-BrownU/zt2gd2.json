    "postText": "I was just accepted into Brown, and I have a few questions that I\u2019ve been unable to find easily on the internet. \n\n1. Is there an enrollment deposit? I see $1,500 when I Google this, but is that undergrad? And, if so, where/when do I pay this?\n\n2. When should I expect instructions on how to enroll? I wanted to get my Brown email set up ASAP, and I\u2019ve already accepted my spot into the class, but I\u2019m not sure if I have to wait until RD release or what. \n\nAny help with these two questions would be greatly appreciated.",

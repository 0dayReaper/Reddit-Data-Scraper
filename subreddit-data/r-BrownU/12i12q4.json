    "postText": "Hey everyone, \n\nI'll be attending Brown next year, and I'll be concentrating in CS and using the Open Curriculum to explore other engineering fields (mainly to learn about electronics/robotics and CAD software). \n\nFor other CS/Comp. Eng./other engineering concentrators at Brown, what do most people use? Mac or Windows? Are there classes that essentially make you use Windows (for CAD, for example)? Would you recommend a Mac or a Windows computer (the budget is not really an obstacle here)? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, as a side question, I've seen many people use the Mac + iPad for notes combo online. Do you see a lot of people using that? Or do most people use paper notebooks and binders and stuff?",

In cases when professors don\u2019t want you to have laptops out, they probably won\u2019t want you to have an iPad out, either. iPads are good for watching shows, but no better than a laptop. If you want to buy something cool and you have a small budget, get a portable projector so you can throw watch parties and stuff.",

I\u2019ve gone through Gentoo, LFS, Windows, Ubuntu, Manjaro, \u2026 and am back to my Mac laptop all the time. It just fucking works, I can find actual support if I run into issues, and pretty much everything I want to use is available with often the same tier of support if not better than whatever x86 .deb (on top of it being unix based as opposed to windows/ ms-dos). That thing has been abused over the past few years.\n\nMaybe the worst thing you can do is get windows. Fewer people will be able to help you, you\u2019ll have more random ass issues, and everything is taught on linux (ie, what you wont have, though you have vagrant, etc)",

            "comment": "For computer engineering I use a windows laptop and a Samsung tablet. Mac is getting more and more popular, I'm a TA for an intro systems class and maybe half the class uses macs versus last year when it was maybe a quarter (according to the professor). I haven't really had any problems using windows but I've also never use apple so idk. A tablet is not worth it for CS imo, but I love it for engineering (especially if you decide to take engn 520, those problem sets can be upwards of 30 pages). I only got the tablet last semester because I had a gift card, so pencil and paper is by no means a hindrance",

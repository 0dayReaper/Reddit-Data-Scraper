    "postText": "I'm a freshmen here at Brown, and I decided to take CHEM 0100 with no real goal in mind. I don't plan on pursuing anything Chemistry after taking the class. I don't have any regrets going through this class because my purpose was to see if I liked the subject. Long story short, I don't. It's been getting in the way of my other classes when it comes to studying and I feel like I'm just wasting time. I'm glad I got to decide if I wanted to do anything Chemistry related, which I don't, bringing me to my main question. Should I drop this class, or should I just power through it? I'm not doing bad, but there's a midterm coming up soon, and it's right next to another midterm coming up. The midterm I actually care about directly helps me in getting my degree while Chemistry doesn't; it just doesnt make sense to me to continue with chemistry. Is it rare for people to drop classes this late? How will this affect my years to come? I plan on actually picking classes I enjoy from now on, so I don't plan on dropping any other classes in the foreseeable future. Any advice at all?",

However, classes dropped after the shopping period will be marked as \u201cdropped\u201d on your transcript (while classes dropped in the first two weeks will not show on your transcript). It doesn't affect anything besides the record on your transcript.",

I would be dropping a class that doesn't help me with my intended major, so I could just tell them that if they ever ask. I guess I'm also worrying about what my peers would think too, especially since I would be going from 4 classes total to 3.",

It's only the first year, so you still have enough time to take classes, get credits and graduate. Don't worry about having 3 classes instead of 4 for the first semester.",

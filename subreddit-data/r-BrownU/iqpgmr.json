    "postText": "&gt;In previous years, we have offered alumni interviews as a way for applicants to get to know Brown while also sharing more about themselves conversationally beyond the information provided in an application. However, as we strive to ensure that all applicants have equitable access to all components of our application process, alumni interviews will not be offered for the 2020-21 admission cycle.\n\n&gt;To better enable consistency across our applicant pool, this year we hope you will instead consider submitting a two-minute video portfolio to tell us more about yourself beyond the information you provided in your application. This additional component of the application process is optional, but may offer another avenue to show us who you are and why you are interested in attending Brown. Videos will not be evaluated for production quality or editing ability; we are simply hoping to get to know you through your own voice. \n\nhttps://admission.brown.edu/first-year/video-portfolio-alumni-interview",

Well done, Brown undergrad admissions!",

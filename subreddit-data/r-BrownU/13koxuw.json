    "postText": "Hi I just got off the Brown waitlist today. I\u2019ve already committed to Duke, but I\u2019m seriously considering Brown.\n\nI want to go either pre law or pre med, most likely pre law as of now. I have some questions about Brown:\n\n1. How\u2019s the alumni network (compared to Duke?)\n2. How is it for pre law or pre med?\n3. How\u2019s the food? (I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s mid)\n4. What is Providence like? (Opportunities, safety, fun)\n5. Unique things about Brown?\n5. Cons to Brown?\n\nU could also just throw everything you love and hate about Brown at me lol. I have a week to respond to Brown. Thanks in advance!",

            "comment": "Here is my pitch. 1-3 are p much gonna be equivalent at both. If you get a good enough gpa(easier at brown)/lsat, you\u2019ll get into a top law school if that\u2019s your goal. \n\nYou should go to the school you think you\u2019ll thrive in. The schools have near identical student bodies in terms of caliber and diversity in my view. You\u2019ll find your people at either.\n\nDo you want to be in the south with more of a sports/frat culture? Do you want to be proximate to Boston/nyc with a more old school feel? Brown\u2019s open curriculum matches it\u2019s ethos very well. Clubs, activities, and societies are very accessible, as are classes and professors. This doesn\u2019t hold true for some but I\u2019ve felt that \u201cfinding myself\u201d was really well facilitated by Browns culture/ecosystem. Try and visit, maybe that can be you.",

In the end, I chose Brown because I'm not much of a sports person, and the open curriculum has given me a lot of free time to do a lot of amazing non-curricular things, plus the culture here is collaborative and relaxed (don't conflate this with a lack of difficulty - it was hard at times, but I learned a lot).",

            "comment": "i think something to consider is that brown doesn\u2019t have a law school whereas duke law is something u might have access to if you do undergrad there! that\u2019s not to say that Brown doesn\u2019t have a lot of pre-law resources\u2014 to my knowledge there are multiple pre law groups, some more general and some specific to identity groups (like women\u2019s pre law association).\n\nas for pre-med, there are a lot of options and premed advising\u2014 although the PLME program attracts many premeds, those that are not a part of it can often benefit from some of the structures in place because of it, like certain courses. \n\nas for food, to be completely honest, duke is the better choice! brown sometimes doesn\u2019t have much variety whereas I believe Duke has more options most of the time.\n\nlike the other comments said\u2014 it\u2019s going to be a culture fit! Duke is a much more sports-focused school in a suburban area that\u2019s a bit hard to get to. Depending on where you\u2019re coming from, the trip to duke can be a bit tedious and it\u2019s somewhat hard in my experience to get off campus there without taking an Uber. Durham &amp; Providence are pretty similar in size, but Durham has more of a nightlife than Providence does. In my experience, Providence has more and cheaper sit-down restaurants and coffee shops whereas Durham seems to be mostly sports bars / fast food type of stuff. One major pro of providence is the connection to New York and Boston. Being close to big cities is always good if you need to fly home and the providence airport is either too expensive / doesn\u2019t have good flights. Boston also makes for a fun weekend trip and it\u2019s pretty cheap to go ($12 tickets from the train station). \n\nDuke is a great place, and I know a lot of people who have gone there and absolutely loved it, so it\u2019s really just up to your preferences regarding culture / access. DM if u want to talk at all about pre-law activities at brown (I am pre law and involved in a couple things here that might be of interest :) )",

            "comment": "My brother went to Duke (graduated 4 years ago) and I chose Brown over Duke.\n\n1. Probably about the same, though Duke\u2019s might be stronger due to its size and stronger greek life if you do that. I was able to leverage Brown\u2019s alumni network to get an internship one summer.\n\n2. Both are excellent for both. I think Brown has one of the highest med school placement rates in the country. \n\n3. Food is definitely better at Duke. Although I was always happy with the food at Brown. \n\n4. Providence is nice, plenty of things to do and I always felt safe. \n\nFor academics, you can\u2019t go wrong. Brown was less intense and stressful compared to my sibling\u2019s experience (but still very stressful at times). There are certain policies I really appreciated that make it easier to keep a good gpa, like being able to take anything pass/fail, being able to drop a class at any time, and having dropped classes/grades below a C not appear on your transcript. Despite the memes about its reputation, it\u2019s well respected by employers and all the top firms (finance, consulting, tech) recruit heavily and students place into top grad programs. This is probably about the same at both.\n\nSocially, Duke has a bigger more traditional party scene, but brown still has plenty of that if you want to seek it out. Duke\u2019s social scene seems pretty competitive, with frats being the main social force and people trying to get into the \u201cbest\u201d frats and sororities. Brown seems less socially stratified and it\u2019s very easy to make friends.\n\nOverall, I loved my experience at Brown and my brother loved his at Duke. Good luck!",

Fast forward to today, she pushed her two daughters to Duke because it is the polar opposite in her experience to Brown. That is just one person who graduated 25 years ago's take, but the big, big difference is the culture and social life. It depends on what you want.",

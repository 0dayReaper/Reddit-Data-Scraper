    "postText": "I just got an UTRA for the fall semester (incoming sophomore) but I already made plans with the other professor who\u2019s research I\u2019m very interested in. The UTRA that I got is not very related but it\u2019s still an UTRA regardless. I\u2019m not sure if I should just take this one for the fall or decline this one and apply for an unlisted UTRA in the spring or summer. \n\nWill probably stay with the professor that I found outside the UTRA for the rest of college. Should I give up this one semester for the UTRA only to not continue that research in the future? \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this or advice? Thanks!",

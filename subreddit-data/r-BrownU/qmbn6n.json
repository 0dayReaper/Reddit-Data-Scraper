    "postText": "I am about to submit some video recordings for Brown, as they allow you to submit music supplements. However, I saw on their webpage that you could submit an audio recording if you wanted to. I got confused when I read this, because wouldn't that just open up the door to false submissions? How would they know that somebody didn't just get their friend to play something? Couldn't people even download the audio from a YouTube video and submit that? Am I missing something?",

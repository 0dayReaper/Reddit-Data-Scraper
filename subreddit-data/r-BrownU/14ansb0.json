Although I need peace for sleep, I'm also a sociable person. I'm wondering if choosing quiet housing could limit my social interactions. Anyone with experience in this housing option, could you share your insights? Thanks in advance!",

You\u2019ll still be able to go to parties, you\u2019ll still be able to form groups of friends, you\u2019re going to be alright. The only way your social life will suffer is if you\u2019re one of those people who spends all day in their room",

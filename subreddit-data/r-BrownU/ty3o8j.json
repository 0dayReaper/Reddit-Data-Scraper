    "postText": "I am a \u201826 prospective humanities/linguistics focus. I\u2019ve been admitted to both Harvard and Brown.\n\nObviously, Harvard is Harvard, but I am somewhat unique (I think) in that I want to do ZERO math for the rest of my life. I hate it, I suck at it, and I hate it. I\u2019ll write a damn book before I\u2019ll do another problem set. \n\nAs such, the open curriculum is *very* appealing to me. I want to go to law school, so grade inflation is also a big plus (though I know Harvard\u2019s is solid too). \n\nI legitimately think I like Brown better, but only slightly. In your experience, do people ever choose Brown over Harvard? Do you find that employers/grad schools are suitably impressed with a great GPA from Brown (even with grade inflation)?\n\nPlease advise!",

Friends who have applied to grad school for master's/law/PhD have widely reported the same. \n\nI think the marginal difference between Brown/Harvard when it comes to prestige is there, and that shouldn't be discredited, but it's not as steep of a difference as with other schools \u2014 if the fit is better here, you probably can easily make up for that gap because you'll be happier and do better. Conversely, if after exploring you find Harvard is a better fit, 200% go there.",

(and as far as I know, they didn't regret it)\n\n&gt;Do you find that employers/grad schools are suitably impressed with a great GPA from Brown (even with grade inflation)?\n\nGPA is a measure of consistency at any school, grade inflation or not. During the years I attended, classes tended to try to address this issue so I wouldn't see grade inflation as an impediment to employers/grad schools acknowledging your curricular achievements. But times could have changed since I graduated in 2017.\n\n\\*another mitigating factor is my concentration was apma/cs; humanities may be different w/ regards to grade inflation trends.",

Just don\u2019t talk to too many that you start to lose your own perspective.\n\nIn any case, you have the best kind of problem - good luck!",

    "postText": "I'm a rising junior from Brown, planning on going off meal plan for the next two semesters. I was curious about which on-campus housing options have stovetop kitchens available, as well as the viability of cooking for myself on campus. I'm thinking mostly about a room in Grad Center (highly prefer a single), so I guess I'm specifically curious about how available the tower kitchens are. I'm mainly worried about kitchens either not having stovetops, or being too constantly crowded to be usable.",

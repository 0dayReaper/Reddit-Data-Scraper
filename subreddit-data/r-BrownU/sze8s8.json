John Brown was an avid slave owner as well so I\u2019m curious how you guys feel about Brown University being named after him considering his troublesome legacy. Also, Brown is a kinda shit name (pun intended) Doesn\u2019t quite roll of the tongue and sound rich and eloquent like Princeton for example.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/sze8s8)",

    "postText": "Hey! Was just thinking of my course schedule and does this look manageable?\n\n1. CSCI 0111 or CSCI 0150 (Which one should I take?)\n2. ECON 1000 (Have 4/5 on both APs. I thus shouldn\u2019t take principles of econ right?)\n3. MATH 0090 (Have a basic background, just not confident enough for 0100)\n4. Choosing between IAPA 0110, ENGN 0090, POLS 0010 and might try to get POLS 0820I FYS as I didn\u2019t get it in the lottery. \n\nWhat would y\u2019all suggest? Is it too much?",

That\u2019s why shopping period is so great and you should really try to see what suits you best while making sure to go to office hours as much as you can (this is how I got through Linear Algebra even though I got 4s and 5s in all the math based APs my school offered).\n\nEdit: made a mistake in acronyms, I thought you were considering the English class rather than engineering, but I will say that eventually you will need a writing requirement class, so it doesn\u2019t hurt to try something new in the humanities",

            "comment": "This seems manageable but, as another commenter mentioned, adjusting to college can be a challenge, and, even if you found high school easy, college is a whole new beast. \n\nNow, let's go through this one by one:\n\n1. I know it's early for you, but what are you considering concentration-wise and career-wise? If you're seriously considering CS as a concentration, take 0150. If you just want a less rigorous introduction to the field or something to develop basic skills, take 0111. I personally enjoyed 0111. \n2. I personally didn't think Principles was too difficult, and i had no econ background. I'd suggest maybe showing up to class, looking at the syllabus, and talking to the professors before making a final choice, but I'd probably take 1000. \n3. What exactly is your calc background? [This website](https://www.math.brown.edu/calcplacement/) has some information on calc placement that can help you make a more informed decision. \n4. I'm only familiar with ENGN 0090 of these 4. It's generally considered to be a relatively easy course. Any of these seem to be a good balance with the three courses above. I'd warn against taking five classes your first semester. \n\nOverall, I think this is a reasonable course load, but be wary of that adjustment period.",

            "comment": "IAPA 0110 is very easy, but not the most useful or interesting class imo. Hackey is friendly and helpful but it was mainly busy work and nobody went to lectures after September. Good if you need it as a prerequisite or want an easy course with skippable lectures and no discussion section.",

            "comment": "If you decide to take CS15, make sure the rest of your schedule is chill. ENGN0090 is a great freshman 1st semester course! Never taken Math90 because I had taken the equivalent AP, but math classes at Brown can be hard to get an A in(although usually very easy to pass). If you\u2019re familiar with Math90, I\u2019d say just take Math0100 S/NC and do your best(you won\u2019t have to worry about it at least). Don\u2019t remember what econ1000 is, but I found principles to be pretty boring. Micro was def more interesting",

    "postText": "Hi! I saw another similar post like this, but it was pre-med focused so I thought I\u2019d make my own. I was accepted to Brown &amp; Duke as a transfer student, and I\u2019d appreciate any opinions. I\u2019m entering as a sophomore and plan on studying Economics at both. Cost is not a huge difference.\n\nBrown: I love the open curriculum and pass/no pass concept because I\u2019m not too fond of strict GE requirements, especially having many categories like at Duke. I like the collaborative environment that Brown has, and I\u2019m sure I can thrive here academically. I\u2019m not crazy about either location, but I\u2019d prefer being closer to NYC. The aspects that I\u2019m curious about is consulting/finance placements in comparison to Duke. Is Brown ever viewed as not \u201cpre-professional\u201d enough? I know Brown is also a great school for consulting, but is there any recruitment advantages that I\u2019m missing out on by not attending Duke? Also I think Brown\u2019s social life and sports culture is a bit lacking compared to Duke. How is greek life/parties?\n\nDuke: Love the weather and sports culture. Also love the work hard play hard vibe. However, I\u2019m concerned about the number of GEs and econ requirements I\u2019d have to finish, like 3 classes of foreign language all over again. I\u2019m also required to start at econ 101, which I heard is really difficult. I\u2019m a diligent student but it\u2019s been over 2 years since my calc 2 class so the math-heavy classes might be tough. I\u2019m not sure if I can handle recruitment seasons, Duke\u2019s social life, adjusting as a transfer student, and the harder academics at the same time. Also don\u2019t like the location in terms of how far it is from the Northeast, but not a huge deal. I recognize Duke has greater recruitment advantages and performs fairly well, whereas I\u2019m not too informed about Brown\u2019s stats. That being said, could also be more competitive for sure.",

            "comment": "Duke does not really have greater recruiting advantages if you\u2019re targeting nyc finance/consulting. That is an outdated view. MBB NYC has Brown as a T1 for NYC (except bcg). Brown\u2019s per capita placement for finance is on par with Duke so I wouldn\u2019t worry about that. If you\u2019re good and prepare early, you\u2019ll place well. Most recent class has had multiple mf pe ft placements and loads of bb and some eb as well. Would caveat that you need to start grinding as soon as you step on campus wrt recruiting as it happens sophomore spring so you gotta prepare soph fall and before. No stupid reqs at Brown which is huge and I\u2019d weigh this heavily.\n\nSocially, there isn\u2019t really the infrastructure of Greek life anymore but those people are still around and you\u2019ll find lots of ways to get in those circles if you put yourself out there. Lots of parties every weekend, although the weekday bar scene is nothing like at Duke from what I\u2019ve heard - basically at brown there\u2019s only darties/parties on Friday/Saturday. I was worried about it when I came to brown but honestly once you make some friends in the varsity sports, you\u2019ll know where to go. I\u2019ll caution again that there\u2019s basically no formal Greek life but it is what it is.\n\nI chose Brown over a few other (non-hyp) ivys + duke/Chicago and would do it again without hesitation. Best of luck.",

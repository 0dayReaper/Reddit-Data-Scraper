                    "comment": "I took chem 33 remotely during covid and the course was jointly taught by Rose-Petruck, Rubenstein, and Chen, with each prof taking 1/3 of the course and administering their own midterm. Never heard of Colvin, but would probably rather take the course taught by Colvin given my experience with R-P.\n\n**\"Rose-Petruck: Very straightforward tests, but you sometimes \u201ccan\u2019t understand what he\u2019s saying\u201d during lectures.\"**\n\nI found his tests to be the easiest, though he can be a bit rough on partial credit. I found that his lectures weren't terrible if you're good at filtering out the parts that aren't terribly relevant (though this frequently amounted to \\~1/3 of the lecture). Most of the confusion I saw in his lectures stemmed from the long tangents he would go on when a student asked a clarifying question, and his explanations frequently went beyond the scope of the course.  Wil note that it was frequently difficult to discern the major takeaway of any given lecture, though you can kinda piece it together in subsequent lectures.\n\n**\"Rubenstein: Amazing lectures, but the tests are tantamount to hazing.\"**\n\nCan confirm both points are true\n\n**\"Chen: Straightforward tests with okay lectures but can come across as condescending at times.\"**\n\nI only ever attended lectures and never went to office hours or otherwise interacted directly with him, but I didn't get the sense that he was overly condescending during lecture - saw it come out like once or twice but it was pretty minor and just along the lines of \"what part of this don't you understand\". YMMV in office hours. Thought he was a pretty decent lecturer but nothing really stood out as amazing; would gladly take another course taught by him though",

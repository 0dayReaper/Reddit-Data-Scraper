I'd meet with your assigned advisor for the best guidance.\n\nHere's my opinion:\n\nPrinciples is kind of hard to ace without prior econ knowledge (me) but REALLY hard to fail. If you have other classes that are extremely time consuming, taking it pass/fail might be the move. When I took it, Dr. Friedberg ended her final lecture with the words \"no one will ever care what grade you receive for this class.\"",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI'm an international freshman student hoping to concentrate in Computer Science, and I'm wondering about the requirements regarding math courses. Having not studied math in English at any point in my life (except for the SATs, but it doesn't really count as the topics weren't too complex), I'm terrified of falling behind in the Math 0090/0100 courses and was therefore thinking about taking the Math 0050 course instead. My question is - is it a good idea? Will it drastically prolong the process of getting into more advanced comp sci courses? (For some background information, I took advanced mathemathics in high school, which I believe is an equivalent of AP Calculus AB)\n\nThank you!",

Calculus isn't hard in general but the trigonometry can get you tripped.",

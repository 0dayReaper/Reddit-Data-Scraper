    "postText": "Hey everyone!   \nI'm an international prospective student considering to apply to Brown because I've developed interest in their PLME programs and their Open Curriculum, especially when I saw the Kitchen Chemistry course, which got me really excited.   \nI was a bit confused at first when I read up about the Open Curriculum, and there were even a few comments and websites that said that there may be not as much 'customization' depending on the concentration you choose. I'd love for any students or alumni to help clear up if it's true and whether it's possible to both do the PLME and the Kitchen Chemistry course.",

            "comment": "It's really just a math problem. With standard assumptions, you have eight semesters taking four classes apiece, for a total of 32 classes in your undergraduate education (Note: you need to pass 30 classes to graduate). It is possible to graduate quicker, but the fee to skip the last semester is basically equivalent to another semester of tuition. You can do 1-2 classes in the winter and summer if you pay an extra fee. It's also possible to take only 3 classes or up to 5 classes in a semester, but most people don't.\n\nFor PLME, you can do any concentration you like. A BA will be something like 10-14 classes (most are 12-13, I think), while a BS will be anywhere from 15-22 classes (20+ is really only for engineering). The remainder of your classes are essentially electives for you to choose. For pre-med, you might want some of those electives to prepare for med school too.\n\nThe only other hangup is you need to take two WRIT-designated classes (one in your first four semesters, one in your last four semesters). There are hundreds of WRIT courses, so you should be able to complete it within your concentration, or you may need/want to use electives to knock it out.\n\nSo, 32 minus 12 (for a BA) minus 2 (worst-case scenario WRIT) equals 18 classes for you to take Kitchen Chemistry, Sex, Power, God, Persuasive Communication, that C.S. Lewis class, Abnormal Psychology, Studio Foundation, CS15, and whatever else tickles your fancy. Don't get carried away by double (or triple!) concentrating and you'll be all set.",

                    "comment": "That makes much more sense.\n\nJust to confirm, let's say I chose the Health &amp; Human Biology concentration, which contains 14 courses (I'm assuming the parts they section the courses into represent each year in my undergrad). Following your example of 4 classes per semester, that would mean I have some open spots per semester to fill with whatever I want.\n\nAnd then once I finish my Bachelor's, I'm headed straight to med school at Brown, if I got that all correctly.",

                            "comment": "You would certainly have open spots each, or at least most, semesters. Could get tricky if a bunch of required courses are offered in the fall but not the spring, which might force you into a semester of just concentration classes, but you'd be able to plan ahead for that.\n\nAlso looking ahead, it does appear that Animal Locomotion in HHB is a WRIT class, so that's one down right there if you choose to take it. I'm guessing you could get another WRIT class approved as part of your 'theme' too; that's where the most flexibility will be in that concentration.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily assume you need to go in the order of the sections HHB has presented. Roughly, but if there's a class offered and you've met the prerequisites, take it while it's offered. I took a 'background/core' class in my concentration my senior spring because I missed it when it was offered while I was a first year and hadn't chosen my concentration yet, and it wasn't offered again until my senior year.",

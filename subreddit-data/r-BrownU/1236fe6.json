    "postText": "Hi! I'm an incoming '27 student curious about the food at Brown. I've seen that the dorm buildings have common rooms and kitchen areas, but I wasn't sure how common it is for students to make their own food rather go to the cafeterias on campus. Otherwise, what is the food like on campus and in cafeterias like the Ratty or Vdub? Are there any food spots that you enjoy in particular or that are popular amongst students? I'm also visiting during ADOCH and would like to try out different food on campus, so I would really appreciate if anyone could share any restaurant or cafe recommendations!",

            "comment": "Keeney has pretty decent kitchen facilities if you bring all of your own supplies, and I believe Andrews is the same. It\u2019s pretty uncommon to make a whole meal for yourself though beyond maybe some microwaveable items, just because it\u2019s so easy to go to the dining hall (even if you have dietary restrictions that would force you to make your own meals at other schools).\n\n-\tThe Ratty is consistently decent\u2014they only occasionally knock your socks off, but usually everything is fine if not enjoyable. \n-\tVdub also makes good, consistent food, but I find it\u2019s a little more boring than the Ratty. \n-\tI find Vdub/Ratty preference is highly based on where you live, just because they\u2019re on different sides of campus.\n-\tAndrews is a bit limited in selection and is less consistent, but is usually good (though the atmosphere may be tough to get over). \n-\tIvy Room is also limited in selection, but sushi is sushi and a smoothie is a smoothie. \n-\tBlue Room is expensive (no meal swipes) but very, very good.\n-\tJo\u2019s is Jo\u2019s. Can\u2019t really hate it when it\u2019s the only thing open past 10. The food is consistent (always chicken sandwich, burger, and some kind of \u201chealthy\u201d option) and good though. I stan it. I often go there over the Ratty for dinner.\n-\tSOE Caf\u00e9 is like Blue Room lite.\n\nOverall, the food at Brown is pretty good. Not *really* good (go to Princeton if you want that), but better than mediocre (like a state school). I don\u2019t go off campus much, but there are several good breakfast places around (Loui\u2019s is the classic, there\u2019s also one in Fox Point that was fine), and people stand by Thayer. You\u2019ll be wasting money though if you go off campus a lot as a freshman though.",

I'm also a little surprised to hear that the atmosphere in Andrews isn't the best since I heard its nickname was \"Hotel Andrews\" lol.",

It feels a lot more like a food court. However, a lot of people stand by it and make the walk from Keeney to it on the daily because they love it so much.",

There are two kitchens in Andrews, but they are in the basement; during COVID, it was a little awkward going there as we were breaking rules and intruding on the basement folks\u2019 unspokenly claimed territory. I live in Minden now and we have no kitchen (and no lounge either); I believe our kitchen is still the health services COVID makeshift office.\n\nYou have to be on meal plan for at least freshman year. Buying groceries costs money and walking to and from Stop n Shop or Whole Foods takes time and energy; if you take up a reasonable schedule, this will be fine. Otherwise good luck.\n\nThere\u2019s something about freshman year vs afterwards. I never got sick from Brown\u2019s food freshman year, but 2nd sem sophomore year Ratty was destroying me 3/5 times and late night Jo\u2019s usually didn\u2019t go too well either. Be warned, at least. I went off meal plan this year and mostly eat whatever and have been fine\u2026 order whatever off of Amazon, eat off the not-quite-fast-food parts of Thayer, and bum a meal swipe off my friends here and there. Occasional trip to Whole Foods, etc, for pre-made, fruit, and other snacks.",

            "comment": "Providence, as a city, has really good options, and a lot of undergrads don\u2019t really explore the city much. If you\u2019re a foodie, there are a lot of reasonably affordable places with varied cuisines - would highly encourage you to explore beyond the 2 blocks immediately surrounding campus. There\u2019s a lot of good Korean food, there\u2019s amazing pizza places, great Uyghur and Greek food as well. Since Johnson and Wales is also in Providence, several students also tend to work or stage in the kitchens in the city, so the food is surprisingly good relative to what one might expect from a small city.",

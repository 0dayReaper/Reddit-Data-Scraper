    "postText": "In Pres. Paxson's video today ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYqSve-vtL0&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYqSve-vtL0&amp;t=1s)) announcing her 2020 university financial report, she name-checks Brown's Political Theory Project alongside the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in the Americas, the Center for Slavery and Justice, and the Watson Institute as examples of Brown's \"efforts to creating more just, peaceful, and prosperous societies.\"\n\nBut this is incredibly misleading and offensive. Whereas CSREA, CSSJ, and Watson are legitimate academic research centers governed by Brown's stated commitment to free inquiry, the Political Theory Project uses slick marketing tactics and the veneer of \"both side\"-ism to hide the fact that it is part of a longstanding, far-reaching, well-funded effort ----financed by the Koch Brothers network--to advance the interests of the ultra-wealthy in ways that are destructive to democracy and the rule of law.\n\nFrom a 2018 article in the Providence Journal ([https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180224/koch-funnels-millions-into-brown-riling-left](https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180224/koch-funnels-millions-into-brown-riling-left))\n\n* \u201cThe Koch network is essentially buying the legitimacy of Brown University for their own private gain and recruiting the next generation of free-market activists,\u201d Ralph Wilson, co-founder of the advocacy group UnKoch My Campus, said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s upsettingly cut and dry if you look at the primary sources.\" Between 2008 and 2016, Brown and the Political Theory Project collectively received more than $1.5 million in donations from the Charles Koch Foundation, according to tax disclosures made public by the foundation and the investigative reporting project ProPublica. The Brown think tank was founded in 2003.\n\nI would encourage everyone to learn more about the Koch brothers and their role in the decades-long far-right, extreme free-market efforts to undermine democracy on behalf of the ultra-wealthy by reading New Yorker reporter Jane Mayer's \"Dark Money\" and historian Nancy McLean's book \"Democracy in Chains.\"\n\nPlease do not let the administration get away with this hogwash without calling it out.",

But they shouldn't take Koch Foundation money to do it and create this skeezy smoke-screen to hide their agenda. It just makes clear that they don't trust their own ideas or research enough to win out on the \"academic marketplace of ideas\" without the ultra-rich--whose material interests their research serves to protect ---putting their grubby paws on the scales. \n\nMore courage, Tomasi, stand behind your ideas on their merits!\n\nAnd the President of the University should NOT put them on par with the work of CSREA, CSSJ etc. As the the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a major labor union noted when the United Negro College Fund accepted Koch Foundation money in 2014, \"UNCF's involvement with the Charles Koch Foundation was 'a betrayal of everything the UNCF stands for' because, they said, the Koch brothers were 'the single most prominent funders of efforts to prevent African-Americans from voting.\" [https://nypost.com/2014/07/10/koch-brother-grant-halts-union-support-for-united-negro-college-fund/](https://nypost.com/2014/07/10/koch-brother-grant-halts-union-support-for-united-negro-college-fund/)\n\nGet Koch money off our campus.

If the CSREA and CSSJ weren\u2019t funded, I don\u2019t know that they would survive the \u201cacademic marketplace of ideas.\u201d Regardless, Tomasi\u2019s works have been fairly influential in political philosophy and political science. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that he is standing by his ideals. As long as Koch money is being used for good (I.e. research and intellectual diversity on campuses), I don\u2019t see a problem with it. If Koch gave money on the condition that Alex Jones be a tenured professor, then we can talk. :)\n\nRe: ideological diversity, it\u2019s clear that at least some people in this thread have problems not with Koch money but the very ideas of the project. Somebody said Tomasi has a \u201ccreepy ideological orbit\u201d whatever that means. I\u2019d also posit that the Koch brothers just... aren\u2019t far right. If anything they are more consistently libertarian. But the fact that everybody else in this thread seems to think that their ideas are emblematic of the far-right really goes to show why we need the Political Theory Project.",

But yes Brown should fund it separately.\n\nI would not trust a university center dedicated to researching the health effects of smoking whose faculty leaders and postdocs were all trained in PhD programs started, funded, and maintained by tobacco companies and the same applies here.\n\nThe Koch Foundation is notorious for its shady dealings with universities that threaten academic freedom: [http://www.unkochmycampus.org/faculty-action/](http://www.unkochmycampus.org/faculty-action/)\n\nBrown has forced them to adhere to a policy of \"Programming First\" which they say \"strongly insulates all decisions about PTP programming from any particular interests of our donor partners.\" But given the Koch's history ---- which, yes, stretches back to the founding of the far-right John Birch Society in the 50s and 60s and maintains its strongly anti-democratic streak, including funding PR campaigns against school desegregation and  the 1964 Civil Rights Act--it's not a good look. There's no indication that they or their allies have shifted their views on the matter in subsequent decades.\n\nNancy Maclean's incredibly well-researched  account of this history, \"Democracy in Chains,\" is absolutely essential reading to understand the amount of effort and money that has gone toward these efforts and disguising them beneath the anodyne sounding language of \"intellectual diversity\" (who would oppose that, right?)\n\nWhat's troubling is seeing the way that the university as a whole is unquestioningly legitimating a decades-long, incredibly successful spin campaign.

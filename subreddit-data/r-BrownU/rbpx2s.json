    "postText": "So I applied to brown ED and they recently asked my for my senior progress report. Because of a lot of family stuff and legal stuff going on, I ended up getting a D in on of my classes on the progress report,but my final grade in the class will be a B/A because I\u2019m getting caught up. However, I am worried brown won\u2019t see that and I\u2019ll get rejected because of this progress report. My counselor has put a note for me with my report explaining my situation and I uploaded a supplement explaining the grade as well. Do you think this will impact my chances badly? Is there anything else I can do? Should I talk to an AO?",

            "comment": "I'm also interested in the advanced standing using AP credit, and as far as I can tell, you don't need to owe any money to Brown for the semester you graduate early, since the AP credit should substitute for 1 semester of tuition/enrollment credit. However, I'd definitely recommend contacting Dean Bhattacharyya, who is in charge of the program, to be sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think there is another advanced standing program that does allow you to graduate a semester early without having AP credit, but you do need to pay tuition in that case.",

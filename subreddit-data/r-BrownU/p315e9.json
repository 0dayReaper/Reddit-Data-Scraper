    "postText": "Hello! Like the title says, I'm a rising first-year interested in concentrating in either public affairs or political science. I want to get started on concentration requirements this year, but I'd love some opinions on which courses and professors people liked/disliked the most. Also would love to hear feedback about the meaningful differences between these concentrations if anyone has any experience \u2013 thanks!",

            "comment": "This semester I took IAPA 0300 \"Costs of War\" and last semester i took POLS 0400 \"Intro to International Politics.\" Keep in mind I took both of these on zoom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, for me, the IAPA class was for more rewarding because it, first of all, took a very humanitarian anti-militarism stance that found really interesting. There were also a few projects throughout the course that forced you to consider specific case studies i.e. Yemen. The IAPA class was focused on how war causes intersecting  physical/ environmental, human, economic, and social consequences. The readings, although they mentioned and developed specific theory, were far more research, ethnography, etc. based. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe POLS class, was very very different from this, and honestly, I  didn't really like it, and probably won't be taking anymore POLS classes (but some people LOVE it). Part of the issue may have been that it was a large intro class, but even then not really, because we had small sections, and I really liked my TA (she was super helpful, and one great thing is that the class definitely teaches you how to write a political science paper!). Anywho the class is incredibly theory based. The first half of the class is theory which seemed fine to me when I read about it on cab. But then you actually get to reading these theories, that personally feel kinda distanced from the human issues we're talking about, are so dense, and all read kind of the same after a while. Anywho these theories are meant to then be applied to specific issues, so that you can analyse them from various perspectives. I think the class was most enjoyable when we were discussing current global issues and analyzing them from different perspectives, rather than just discussing elusive theories.  For example, when we were learning about inherent corruption behind 'humanitarian aid.' \n\nAnywho this ended up being super long, but another major difference to me is that IAPA classes seem to take a particular stance (anti-imperial, anti-military, humanitarian, policy-based, market economy driven etc. ) where as poli sci classes give you the theories to discuss political decisions that occur as a result of specific frameworks ( political gain, militarism, market-based economy etc.) keep in mind though that this might be different for policy &amp; governance track specific-classes!",

Professor Kennedy is outstanding \n\nYou could also choose an IAPA elective to take for your first semester, theres a list of what counts for each track on the website in a Google sheet. Most don\u2019t have pre reqs!\n\nIAPA will give you a lot more freedom in what courses you can take (they pull from the sociology, education, history, public health, urban studies, political science, and so many other departments), while for political science you mainly take political science courses.",

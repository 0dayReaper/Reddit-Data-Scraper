            "comment": "Brown is a great school for premeds - the lack of a +/- on grades makes it easier to maintain a 4.0 if you want (a 90.0% is still a 4.0, while at other schools that would be a 3.7), the downside being if you get a high B, it's a 3.0.\n\nAs for research opportunities, it's hard to talk about them from an individual standpoint because I've only applied to and worked from one lab, but I haven't seen anybody struggling to find a lab to work in. I'm fortunate that the lab I initially joined was awesome, that I've enjoyed my work, and haven't had a reason to try switching :)\n\nAnd as for freshman classes, try not to overload yourself and if possible, take CHEM 0330. It's a fall-only class, so taking CHEM 0100 (or skipping chemistry) delays the sequence by a full year. There ARE nuances, as a very small % of schools will require 2 semesters of inorganic chemistry which means that you'll need to take CHEM 0400. If one of your dream schools requires that, you might actually want to take CHEM 0100 instead to avoid taking the more difficult classes later on. But again, a very small % - maybe two of the 30-ish schools I applied to required that. Most would accept biochemistry as a substitute, required three total chemistry semesters, or some other weird combination.\n\nYou should join the [Brown Esports Discord server](https://discord.gg/brownesports), I've talked a lot there about my premed experience at Brown and you can look through our past chat logs. Just search for keywords like \"premed\" and a lot of past conversations should come up!",

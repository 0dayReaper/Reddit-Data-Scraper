I\u2019m fine with keeping my commuter outside, but I also have a fairly expensive one that I\u2019d like to secure in my room if possible.\n\nAlso, I noticed the map shows some buildings with indoor bicycle storage. Are those pretty secure with a simple bike lock?\n\nThank you!!",

            "comment": "I doubt they care (as long as there's no motor or making a huge mess). I know Andrews has an indoor bike room and its just a small room with a metal bike rack that you lock it to. Felt plenty secure to me as you need card access to get into the building (or sneaking in through andrews commons) and was definitely 100x better than leaving it outside. If you're not in a dorm with an indoor bike rack then you could probably ask someone you know in a dorm with an indoor one for access to keep it there.\n\nAlso if you don't already do this, I'd recommend these especially if leaving a bike outside at all: Make sure that wheels and seat are not quick releases (its annoying but worth) as wheels and seats will be stolen from locked up bikes. Also use a strong U-lock (dps will give you one if you don't have I think) that goes around the main frame, and I also recommend a secondary cable to secure the wheels. Also I'd recommend registering your bike with DPS \\*incase\\* something happens to it",

From what I have heard based on past years a general think is like try not to drop /significantly/ which to our school is more than 5 points. I had some friends who have gone to their US unis with 41/42 predicted and ended up with 37/42 on the exams and are fine. I think for me at least I will try to maintain but not drop more than 4 points in my subjects. Idk I am just doing my best i guess idk what else I can do hehe.",

For instance, if you go from all A\u2019s to a mix of A\u2019s and B\u2019s, they won\u2019t give a shit. I\u2019ve heard of people getting C\u2019s their senior year and still being fine. An F or two might get the university to act, but at most you\u2019ll just be put on academic probation. \n\nBar literal crimes or the university finding out you lied on your application, it is ridiculously hard to to rescinded",

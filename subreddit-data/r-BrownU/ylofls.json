    "postText": "Hi all - I\u2019m visiting campus this coming week with my (HS Junior) son. We\u2019ve got a tour of the engineering department at 11am, but weren\u2019t able to get an official campus tour, so now I\u2019m hoping to find an \u201cunofficial\u201d one\u2026\n\nIs there any current student who would be able to meet my son and me at/around 9:30am on Friday the 11th and give us a quick tour/walk around? Will pay $50 and bring coffee. Please send me a pm if you\u2019re up for it. Thanks so much!",

I remember when I was touring as a high school student - the positivity and genuine passion Brown students have for their school is unmatched and quite honestly one of the reasons I applied. I\u2019d love to be able to do that for someone else",
